One of the students in the group made national headlines earlier this week for publishing an open letter to Harvard that alleged university officials didn\u2019t take her sexual assault case seriously, spurring her eventual diagnosis with depression.\n\nThe federal complaint includes personal testimonials from the group of students who filed it, as well as summaries of student interviews conducted by Our Harvard Can Do Better, a sexual assault prevention group on campus. Students reported that they had difficulty navigating the administration\u2019s process for dealing with sexual assault reports. Some of them received conflicting information about their options, and others encountered insensitive responses from administrators.\n\nFor instance, the complaint states that one Harvard student, who is a woman of color, was told that \u201cIt\u2019s in your culture that men are gropey\u201d after she tried to report her sexual assault.\n\nSince the anonymous open letter was published in Harvard\u2019s student newspaper earlier this week, the community has quickly responded to the reignited controversy over sexual assault \u2014 an issue that the institution has been grappling with for several years by now. The school\u2019s Undergraduate Council formed a task force to advocate for changes to the sexual assault policy. The Council\u2019s president said he was \u201ctaken aback\u201d and \u201cdisturbed\u201d by the allegations in the letter, which included assertions that the victim of sexual assault was dissuaded from pursuing a case and was forced to continue living in the same dorm as her assailant.\n\nAnd Harvard officials soon confirmed that they will support that task force. \u201cSexual harassment and sexual assault can never be tolerated,\u201d Harvard\u2019s dean of student life wrote in a letter to the community that was obtained by ABC News. \u201cThis op-ed has sparked discussions across the community. As we enhance and refine our policies and procedures, we also need constructive engagement with our community, especially the student community.\u201d\n\nAs the Huffington Post reports, Harvard is the only Ivy League university that doesn\u2019t use the \u201caffirmative consent\u201d standard in its sexual assault policy. Affirmative consent requires both sexual partners to say \u201cyes\u201d in order for their subsequent encounter to be considered consensual, rather than requiring the victim to prove that they said \u201cno.\u201d But Harvard\u2019s decades-old policy has a narrow definition of \u201cindecent assault and battery\u201d that must involve \u201cunwanted touching or fondling of a sexual nature that is accompanied by physical force or threat of bodily injury.\u201d Student activists have been fighting to change this language to no avail so far.\n\nHarvard isn\u2019t the only institution grappling with these issues. Over the past year, the growing campus activism to push for better sexual assault policies has sparked national headlines. The college sexual assault crisis spurred President Obama to announce the creation of a new federal task force specifically focused on combating rape at colleges and universities.\n\nThese student activists have already impacted public opinion. Just 12 percent of Americans think that higher education institutions are doing a good job responding to sexual assault allegations.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The complaint comes just days after a Harvard student published an open letter to the institution explaining how her sexual assault wasn't taken seriously.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The complaint comes just days after a Harvard student published an open letter to the institution explaining how her sexual assault wasn't taken seriously.", "title": "Harvard Students File Federal Complaint To Demand Better Sexual Assault Policies On Campus", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/04/03/3422695/harvard-students-federal-complaint-rape/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/rape-culture.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The complaint comes just days after a Harvard student published an open letter to the institution explaining how her sexual assault wasn't taken seriously.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/rape-culture-321x214.jpg", "title": "Harvard Students File Federal Complaint To Demand Better Sexual Assault Policies On Campus", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/rape-culture.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/rape-culture.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-03T15:42:13+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34b6\"", "article_summary": "Health Harvard Students File Federal Complaint To Demand Better Sexual Assault Policies On Campus CREDIT: Richard Potts/FlickrOn Thursday, a group of Harvard students filed a federal complaint with the U.S. Department of Education detailing the issues with their institution\u2019s sexual assault policies.\nOver the past year, the growing campus activism to push for better sexual assault policies has sparked national headlines.\nJust 12 percent of Americans think that higher education institutions are doing a good job responding to sexual assault allegations.\nStudents reported that they had difficulty navigating the administration\u2019s process for dealing with sexual assault reports.\nThe federal complaint includes personal testimonials from the group of students who filed it, as well as summaries of student interviews conducted by Our Harvard Can Do Better, a sexual assault prevention group on campus."}
