(AP) - Local artist Chelsea Elliott has been selected as a winner in the Grateful Dead\u2019s Fabulous Envelope Contest landing her artwork on the front of the tickets for one of the last shows of the band\u2019s 50th anniversary tour.\n\n\u201cI?think my jaw hit the floor. I didn\u2019t think I?would ever win. I\u2019m really excited,\u201d said Elliott, of Frostburg.\n\nThe Grateful Dead, the iconic San Francisco-based rock band, had announced that they wanted to honor the \u201cdays of old\u201d by holding a mail-order ticket sale. A throwback to the 1960s, those wanting to attend shows were asked to get tickets through the mail. As was done in the past, those requesting tickets often decorated the outside of the envelopes with art in an effort to get their ticket request noticed.\n\nThe artwork was often very original and well-crafted. There have even been books published featuring the envelope art.\n\n\u201cThere were a half million requests for tickets,\u201d said Elliott.\n\nElliott\u2019s artwork was one of nearly 600,000 mail-in ticket requests.\n\nThe Grateful Dead\u2019s final concerts of the tour are three shows at Chicago\u2019s Soldier Field. The three sold-out shows will be held July 3, 4 and 5.\n\nElliott\u2019s ticket design will be on the front of the tickets for the July 3 show. Elliott\u2019s artwork also includes the Cumberland postmark that appeared on the envelope.\n\n\u201cMine was the only one to include the postmark on it,\u201d?said Elliott.\n\nA tattoo artist at Tattoo Nouveau on George\u2019s Creek Road in Midland, Elliott\u2019s boss, Jessica Muessen, also had her number design of \u201c50th\u201d selected to appear on the back of the tickets.\n\nElliott received a call from a staff member of the the Dead\u2019s website ticket-sales company, \u201cGDTS Too,\u201d in California on April 8. She received the good news that her envelope art was selected as a contest winner.\n\n\u201cI?screamed like a little girl. I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Elliott.\n\nElliott had sent requests for two tickets, each for all three nights in Chicago.\n\n\u201cI thank my dad (Michael Elliott) for getting me into the best kind of music. I\u2019m a huge Grateful Dead fan,\u201d said Elliott, a 2007 graduate of Allegany High School and a 2012 graduate of Frostburg State University.\n\nKnown as the \u201cFare Thee Well,\u201d?tour, the Dead\u2019s 50th shows include longtime members Bob Weir, Phil Lesh and Mickey Hart. Trey Anastasio has joined the group on guitar.\n\nElliott and her boyfriend plan to travel by Amtrak to the concerts. She was able to get tickets for all three nights with one night free for winning the contest.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Cumberland (Md.)
