A topic Abramoff knows well. What\u2019s more, Adelson\u2019s pressure \u2013 that is to say, his financial support \u2013 is tipping some in the GOP to support his proposed ban.\n\nSenator Lindsay Graham (R-SC) had been silent on Internet gambling right up until he introduced federal legislation to ban it, and the legislation was announced after Adelson dropped $15,000 into Graham\u2019s election coffers. Governor Rick Perry (R-TX) \u2013 who was palling around with Adelson at a New York City gala earlier this summer \u2013 knows full well that Adelson single-handedly kept alive Newt Gingrich\u2019s failed 2012 presidential bid. The governor has also been on the receiving end of Adelson\u2019s political support.\n\nAdelson isn\u2019t just any billionaire. He puts his money where his mind is or, perhaps one could say, where his interests lie. In 2012 alone, he donated around $100 million to Republican candidates and causes. His largesse coupled with his stated willingness to \u201cspend whatever it takes\u201d to see his federal ban passed has many Republicans scrambling to win what has been dubbed the \u201cAdelson primary\u201d and be the next big beneficiary of Adelson\u2019s political generosity.\n\nAdelson has launched a high profile campaign to protect profits at his casinos from online competition. Adelson fears the competition from states legalizing online gaming, and he believes it is suicidal for casino interests not to seek a ban. Nevada, Delaware, and New Jersey have legalized online gaming and nearly a dozen more states are considering following suit. So Adelson launched an astroturf coalition, hired lobbyists to write legislation, and dug deep into his political connections.\n\nA billionaire who wants the federal government to usurp the right of states to regulate gaming within their own borders in order to shield his own business interests should be anathema to conservatives. Sadly, rather than the unified front of conservative opposition one might expect, the poseurs are being separated from the principled.\n\nGovernor Rick Perry fell hard. Despite routinely giving rousing speeches railing against federal government intrusion into state affairs, the 2016 presidential hopeful sent a letter to Congress imploring them to pass Adelson\u2019s gaming ban. He now seems to believe that Texas needs the federal government to protect it from gambling occurring a thousand miles from its own border.\n\nStates\u2019 rights have long been a defining principle for Republicans, and an unequivocal contrast with the Democrats\u2019 penchant for federal government intervention. It\u2019s hard to find a Republican who at one time or another hasn\u2019t preached federalism and railed against federal overreach, especially since the 2008 election. Republicans have found states\u2019 rights a particularly comfortable perch from which to combat President Obama on everything from Obamacare to environmental regulations, education, and property rights.\n\nThere is, however, one Texan who is standing his ground on the proper role of the federal government \u2014 Congressman Ted Poe. During a recent interview on the Chris Salcedo Show, Congressman Poe was asked his opinion on a federal ban on gambling. While he personally isn\u2019t enthusiastic about gambling, he understands that the Tenth Amendment doesn\u2019t have a clause allowing for the personal opinion of those in Congress. He stated without caveat that, \u201cIt\u2019s a states\u2019 rights issue. Leave the states alone federal government and let them deal with it however they want to deal with it but not have the federal government rush in and try to control gaming in the entire country.\u201d\n\nWhile it is comforting to know there is at least one Republican who still supports the Constitution, one may not be enough to stop Adelson, and one lone member certainly isn\u2019t enough to save the integrity of conservatives in Congress.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jerry Rogers", "description": "Even Jack Abramoff seeis it for what it is: 'corruption'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Just last week, Jack Abramoff \u2013 yes that Jack Abramoff \u2013 told\u00a0Human Events\u00a0that Sheldon Adelson\u2019s attempts to ban online gaming is plain, political corruption.
