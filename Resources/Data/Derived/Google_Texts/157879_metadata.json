Let\u2019s get this out of the way. What did you come here to plug?\u201d\n\nAnd local politicians are out at rallies like one in Homewood on Tuesday, to encourage everyone to sign up at http://www.healthcare.gov.\n\nSo far, 160,000 Pennsylvanians have enrolled, but many more have not, including Dylan Farer of Brookline, who is still uninsured.\n\n\u201cMy girlfriend is actually pushing me to because I can\u2019t let it slip away,\u201d Farer told KDKA money & politics editor Jon Delano.\n\nAnd time is slipping away.\n\n\u201cMy mom, she was downsized. She got a new job. She was a contractor. She actually just signed up for Obamacare last week,\u201d said Anna Carlino of Swissvale.\n\nActually, it\u2019s private insurance made affordable through Obamacare, say supporters.\n\n\u201cThe majority of them will be eligible for federal tax credits which will help them pay for their insurance, and they can have that piece of mind if they have an accident or something happens to them it won\u2019t cause a financial disaster in their families,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, a Forest Hills Democrat.\n\nWhile the poor have Medicaid and seniors have Medicare, Obamacare is for the working middle class.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the average uninsured person is white, male, with a job, high school educated, between the ages of 35 and 54.\n\nIf you miss the March 31 deadline, you can no longer enroll for coverage until next fall and you will pay a penalty when you file your 2014 taxes \u2014 $95 or one percent of your income, whichever is more.\n\nHealth care advocates hope you will listen to the celebrity moms.\n\nJonah Hill\u2019s mom: \u201cTaking care of yourself so your mothers can sleep and have a nice life after all they\u2019ve done for you is not too much to ask.\u201d\n\nJennifer Lopez\u2019 mom: \u201cSo please get covered.\u201d\n\nAlicia Keys\u2019 mom: \u201cDo it for your mom.\u201d\n\nRELATED LINKS\n\nObamacare: What Every Small Business Owner Needs To Know\n\nHealthcare.gov Enrollment Numbers Lower Than Expected\n\nMore Political News", "article_metadata": {"description": "Getting every American to sign up for health insurance has put President Obama on web shows like Between Two Ferns with comedian Zach Galifianakis.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2014/03/18/push-on-to-get-health-insurance-by-march-31-deadline-or-risk-penalty/", "image": {"width": 770, "secure_url": "https://cbspittsburgh.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/obamacare.jpg?w=770", "identifier": "https://cbspittsburgh.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/obamacare.jpg?w=770", "height": 433}, "type": "article", "description": "Getting every American to sign up for health insurance has put President Obama on web shows like Between Two Ferns with comedian Zach Galifianakis.", "title": "Push On To Get Health Insurance By March 31 Deadline Or Risk Penalty"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbspittsburgh.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/obamacare.jpg?w=770", "description": "Getting every American to sign up for health insurance has put President Obama on web shows like Between Two Ferns with comedian Zach Galifianakis.", "site": "/CBSPittsburgh", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Push On To Get Health Insurance By March 31 Deadline Or Risk Penalty"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Pittsburgh", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Pittsburgh", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPittsburgh", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPittsburgh"}, "keywords": "local, news, politics, syndicated local, between two ferns, deadline, healthcare.gov, jon delano, obamacare, politics, president barack obama, zach galifinakis", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/97501d9d4ef7a23e7663780b0a506821?s=16", "news_keywords": "between two ferns, deadline, healthcare.gov, jon delano, obamacare, politics, president barack obama, zach galifinakis"}, "article_summary": "PITTSBURGH (KDKA) \u2014 Getting every American to sign up for health insurance has put President Obama on web shows like \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d with comedian Zach Galifianakis.\n\u201cMy girlfriend is actually pushing me to because I can\u2019t let it slip away,\u201d Farer told KDKA money & politics editor Jon Delano.\nSo far, 160,000 Pennsylvanians have enrolled, but many more have not, including Dylan Farer of Brookline, who is still uninsured.\nIn Pennsylvania, the average uninsured person is white, male, with a job, high school educated, between the ages of 35 and 54.\nActually, it\u2019s private insurance made affordable through Obamacare, say supporters."}
