Our bill to limit the online sale of ammunition is a long-overdue common sense reform that I am hopeful will spark Congress to put aside party difference and come together to help prevent such senseless tragedies.\n\nPallone and Coleman are focusing on Aurora theater gunman James Holmes\u2019 online ammo purchases as a selling point for their legislation. In so doing, they have overlooked the fact that Holmes passed background checks for the firearms he acquired and, therefore, would not have been prevented from ammunition purchases even if forced to show ID in a face-to-face manner.\n\nIn the end, the Stop Online Ammunition Sales Act would actually put ammunition dealers in the position of having to guess the intent of ammo purchasers and to force law-abiding purchasers to jump through even more hoops before getting the affordable ammunition they need for target practice, hunting, or self-defense.\n\nThe bill also overlooks the fact that Holmes\u2019 attack took place in a gun-free zone, just like Adam Lanza\u2019s attack at Sandy Hook Elementary, Aaron Alexis\u2019 attack at the DC Navy Yard, and Seung-Hui Cho\u2019s attack at Virginia Tech. In such attacks, a bulk of ammo is not nearly as important as shot placement, given the fact that the would-be victims are unable to shoot back because of Democrat-supported gun-free zone policies.\n\nThe Stop Online Ammunition Sales Act is also sponsored by Representative Donald Payne Jr. (D-NJ-10th Dist.), who said, \u201cThis common-sense reform would save lives by depriving violent criminals of a means of anonymously amassing ammunition without proper scrutiny.\u201d\n\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter @AWRHawkins.
