Walker, the U.S. Virgin Islands attorney general, served a 14-page subpoena to the institute while investigating ExxonMobil Corp.\u2019s alleged misrepresentation of its products and activities contributing to climate change \u201cin order to defraud the government \u2026 and consumers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWalker is part of a network of state \u2018AGs United for Clean Power\u2019 who have formed a grand inquisition to go after those they claim have lied about climate change\u2014which is a contentious and unproven scientific theory,\u201d Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, wrote in an op-ed for The Daily Signal.\n\nAttorneys general of 20 states have launched an effort to investigate and prosecute organizations that have attempted to combat global warming, EcoWatch reported last month.\n\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor, wrote in an opinion piece in USA Today:\n\nNot everyone believes that the planet is warming; not everyone who thinks that it is warming agrees on how much; not everyone who thinks that it is warming even believes that laws or regulation can make a difference. Yet the goal of these state attorneys general seems to be to treat disagreement as something more or less criminal.\n\nThe subpoena in discussion, issued outside Walker\u2019s jurisdiction by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, seeks documents that date from 1997 to the end of 2006, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n\nSam Kazman, general counsel for the institute, said on the call Tuesday:\n\nWhile they seemed geared towards just looking at our communications and documents relating to Exxon, if you read them carefully, they really go after just about everything we have done on climate and energy policy for a full decade and for the names of, really, all our donors.\n\nKazman added:\n\nWe believe this is an outrageous violation of our First Amendment rights.\n\nAccording to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, \u201cthe subpoena requests a decade\u2019s worth of communications, emails, statements, drafts, and other documents regarding CEI\u2019s work on climate change and energy policy, including private donor information.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The subpoena] is designed not only to silence us, but it is also designed to defund us,\u201d Myron Ebell, director of the institute\u2019s Center for Energy and Environment, said Tuesday, adding:\n\nThese efforts to defund us and other free market groups that have unpolitically correct views on climate and some other major issues[.] \u2026 We\u2019ve been dealing with this for a long time, but I think we have now reached another level. When you get attorney general involved, it\u2019s no longer just a debate in the public base that try to shut us up, but it\u2019s using the full force of the state to do so. We\u2019re taking this very seriously.\n\nAs far as the Competitive Enterprise Institute knows, its officials said on the call, it is the first nonprofit to receive a subpoena as a result of \u201can intimidation campaign to criminalize speech and research on the climate debate, led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and former Vice President Al Gore.\u201d\n\nKazman had said in a statement last week:", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cIt\u2019s no longer just a debate in the public base that try to shut us up, but it\u2019s using the full force of the state to do so,\u201d a think tank official says.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s no longer just a debate in the public base that try to shut us up, but it\u2019s using the full force of the state to do so,\u201d a think tank official says.", "title": "Think Tank Announces It Will Fight Government's Subpoena", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160412_CEIcall_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-13T11:58:47+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1qOSlXl"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s no longer just a debate in the public base that try to shut us up, but it\u2019s using the full force of the state to do so,\u201d a think tank official says.", "title": "Think Tank Announces It Will Fight Government's Subpoena", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160412_CEIcall_Jessen.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "climate change", "published_time": "2016-04-12T19:04:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-13T11:58:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Exxon Mobil, Competitive Enterprise Institute, climate change, Virgin Islands, attorney general, subpoena, Kent Lassman"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02e6\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019ve been targeted for our ideas,\u201d Kent Lassman, the new president and CEO of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said Tuesday.\nThe Competitive Enterprise Institute, a public policy think tank, will oppose a subpoena that demands documents related to its research on climate change and donor information, officials of the institute said in a Tuesday afternoon phone call.\nYet the goal of these state attorneys general seems to be to treat disagreement as something more or less criminal.\nThe subpoena in discussion, issued outside Walker\u2019s jurisdiction by the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, seeks documents that date from 1997 to the end of 2006, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute.\n\u2026 We\u2019ve been dealing with this for a long time, but I think we have now reached another level."}
