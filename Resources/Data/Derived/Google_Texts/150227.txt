Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Ohio, a private commercial insurer, was the largest health insurer in the state by premium revenue in 2013, according to a recent report from the Ohio Hospital Association.

Anthem Blue Cross, which operates its Ohio headquarters in Warren County’s Deerfield Twp., posted profit of $392.5 million on total revenue of $5.2 billion last year, according to the trade group’s annual report.

Across Ohio, Anthem’s health plans enroll about 3.3 million people, according to spokeswoman Kim Ashley. Those numbers were not broken down by enrollment in employer plans, Medicare or plans offered on the federal Affordable Care Act’s health insurance marketplace.

“Our enrollment in the Exchange is meeting our expectations, and we will continue to offer a wide range of products and options to Ohioans, including both on and off the Exchange,” Ashley said.

CareSource, a downtown Dayton-based Medicaid managed care provider, is Ohio’s second largest health insurer. The nonprofit health plan recorded profit of $135 million last year on premium and other revenue of $4.2 billion.

Rounding out the top five by premium revenue were Aetna Health Inc. ($3 billion); Medical Mutual of Ohio ($2.5 billion); and Molina Healthcare of Ohio Inc. ($1.2 billion).

The total gain last year for the 22 health insurers that submitted financial statements to the Ohio Department of Insurance was $939 million on premium revenue of $23 billion, according to the OHA report. Premium revenue was up 2 percent over 2012, and profit margin was up 4.2 percent for the group.

Total membership grew by 2 percent, but the numbers did not include new members gained through the expansion of Medicaid in Ohio and plans sold directly to consumers through the health law’s insurance marketplace.
