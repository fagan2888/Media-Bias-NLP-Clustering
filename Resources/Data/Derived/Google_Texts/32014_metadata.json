Last week\u2019s interview with Carol Schwartz is available here. Next week: Muriel Bowser.\n\nIf he should emerge as the winner in the Nov. 4 mayoral election, D.C. Council member David Catania (I-At-Large) would become the first non-Democrat, the first white person, and the first out gay to become mayor of the nation\u2019s capital since the start of the city\u2019s home rule government in 1974.\n\nMost political observers agree that those are three big hurdles to overcome, and many believe Catania\u2019s status as a non-Democrat may be the most difficult of the three.\n\nBut Catania, 46, and his supporters \u2013 both gay and straight \u2013 argue that a careful assessment of his 17-year record on the City Council would convince voters that he is the most progressive of the three main candidates in the race and a proven \u2018good-government\u2019 advocate who\u2019s most qualified for the job of mayor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only one in the race with a progressive record of substance,\u201d Catania said in an interview with the Washington Blade earlier this month.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that progressive record resonates across all demographics in our city,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve won five races citywide. I\u2019ve made friends in every corner of the city. And I have delivered for every corner of the city.\u201d\n\nAdded Catania, \u201cAnd when people go into the voting booths they are asking themselves do they want a mayor who can deliver and who has delivered and who knows where he or she is going to take the city. Do they want values or do they want labels?\u201d\n\nSome believe Catania faces another hurdle of overcoming his status as a former Republican in the eyes of at least some D.C. voters. Catania first won his seat on the Council in 1997 as a Republican. He switched from being a Republican to an independent in 2004 when President George W. Bush announced his support for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.\n\nCatania again points to his record, dismissing as ridiculous any notion that he would be influenced by the rightward drifting GOP he says he abandoned for reasons beyond Bush\u2019s opposition to marriage equality.\n\nHe said his Republican roots stem, among other things, from his childhood upbringing in his mother\u2019s hometown of Osawatomie, Kan., a town in which the abolitionist movement with close ties to the then fledgling Republican Party took hold shortly before the start of the Civil War. Catania notes that the town\u2019s leaders advocated for Kansas to become a free rather than a slave state.\n\nHe\u2019s most proud, he said, of his role as author and lead advocate for the city\u2019s marriage equality law that the Council passed in 2009 and enabled same-sex couples to begin marrying in D.C. in early 2010. He says he\u2019s also proud to have authored a transgender rights measure that requires the city to issue a new birth certificate for people who transition from one gender to another.\n\nOther city measures he authored and played a key role in shepherding through the Council include the city\u2019s medical marijuana law and the \u201csmoke free\u201d law banning smoking in most places of employment, including bars and restaurants. During his 10-year stint as chair of the Council\u2019s health committee, Catania is credited with pushing through major reforms in the city\u2019s AIDS related programs, boosting the city\u2019s program for providing medical insurance for low-income residents and children, and preventing United Medical Center, the city\u2019s only hospital serving residents east of the Anacostia River, from closing due to financial problems.\n\nCatania\u2019s two main rivals in the mayor\u2019s race \u2013 Council member Muriel Bowser (D-Ward 4), the frontrunner in the race according to latest polls, and former Council member Carol Schwartz, a Republican turned independent, argue that their own records and accomplishments make them the best suited to be mayor.\n\nBowser has said she is reaching out to all voters, even though her campaign emphasizes she\u2019s the Democratic candidate who\u2019s been endorsed by President Obama. With more than 76 percent of the city\u2019s voters registered as Democrats, most political observers consider Bowser to have a significant advantage.\n\nCatania supporters, including his large cadre of Democratic supporters such as former Council member Sharon Ambrose (D-Ward 6), point to what they say are strong signs of voter dissatisfaction with the status quo of D.C. politics.\n\nThe indictment of three City Council members in recent years on corruption-related charges and the investigation of Mayor Vincent Gray for the illegal \u201cshadow\u201d campaign linked to his 2010 election have changed the way voters view their elected officials and candidates, many political pundits have said.\n\nCatania backers, noting that two of the three indicted Council members were Democrats and the other had strong ties to the Democratic Party, have said voters are ready to break from the past trend of electing only Democrats as mayor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m clearly the anti-establishment candidate,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this city we have a machine and I don\u2019t want to be a part of that machine\u2026I want to see things that aren\u2019t right and I want to make them right.\u201d\n\nCatania has been endorsed by a number of organizations his supporters consider to be progressive, including the Sierra Club and the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund. He received a +10 rating from the Gay and Lesbian Activists Alliance, the group\u2019s highest possible score.\n\nThe Blade interviewed Catania for this story on Oct. 6, the day the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for same-sex marriage to become legal in several new states.\n\nWashington Blade: There\u2019s breaking news this morning from the Supreme Court, which refused to take on the same-sex marriage cases from several states, including Virginia. It appears that same-sex marriages can begin in Virginia as soon as today. What is the significance of that as you see it?\n\nDavid Catania: It\u2019s breathtaking \u2013 the scope and pace of change with respect to marriage equality today. I\u2019m reminded that on this day five years ago on Oct. 6 of 2009 is when I introduced the marriage equality legislation in the Council. So we\u2019ve come a long way in five years. It\u2019s a pleasant coincidence that the Supreme Court would deny cert for these many circuits on the subject of marriage equality on the same day that marks the introduction of marriage here. We\u2019ve come a long way.\n\nBlade: How do you see D.C. fitting into all of this?\n\nCatania: What\u2019s interesting is that in 2014 a lot of people kind of jumped on the marriage bandwagon. But I remember laying the foundation for this work in 2008, when many of the individuals who have been involved in advancing LGBT rights in the city were not sold on the timing of my introduction and the strategy that we took. But I took a very purposeful strategy starting in November of 2008 that ultimately culminated in the introduction in October of 2009. It was a very deliberate, very focused effort to get people, to get the community galvanized, to get the community on board with the notion of inevitability to bring the various leaders in the community together, to bring the religious community together with the LGBT community.\n\nWe got very lucky. A whole series of events made it possible for us to go forward. I want to say that I think often about Frank Kameny. And it\u2019s a name I hope we don\u2019t forget. And I think of him in particular as the father of the movement here in so many ways. Now there have been so many others. I don\u2019t want to suggest him at the exclusion of others. But as far as me personally, Frank Kameny played a big role in my thinking toward how we were going to capture our equality.\n\nBlade: With that as a backdrop, why are you running for mayor?\n\nCatania: Well, for the last 17 years I\u2019ve gotten up every day with an incredible sense of urgency, and I\u2019ve run toward the city\u2019s problems. And I\u2019m running for mayor for the same reason I ran for Council in 1997. I see a city that can do better. And I see things that aren\u2019t right and I want to make them right.\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve spent my career doing. And globally it\u2019s a city that has strong enduring fundamental strengths. But we haven\u2019t really lived our values. Our values \u2013 our common values as a city \u2013 where after 17 years having been in every corner of the city I can tell you as a city we have common values that are deeply American values. We believe in opportunity. We believe in fairness. We believe in playing by the rules. And yet our government very often falls short of those values. I think we need a government that is as good as we are, as good as our values. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m running.\n\nI\u2019m the only one in the race that candidly has a record of delivering for people. So my principle opponent is trying to encourage people to be for her because of her party label. And it\u2019s hard to see any evidence that she advanced the ball on behalf of the people in our city.\n\nYou know, I can look at without question having the most progressive record in this race, regardless of label. My values are in line with the residents of our city. I have the most progressive record without fail in this race \u2013 having authored marriage equality, having authored medical marijuana many years ago before that was an easy thing to do.\n\nMy work as the chairman of the Committee on Health \u2013 we made some historic progress in this city. We cut the rate of uninsured in half through improvements in our publicly funded system and targeted expansions and eligibility. We went from 12.8 percent uninsured to 5.9 percent \u2014 the second lowest rate in the country \u2014 3.2 percent for children \u2014 the lowest rate in the country.\n\nYou recall the HIV/AIDS crisis that I inherited in 2005, when we were compared to Third World countries, where we had an epidemic three times the rate of a World Health Organization epidemic, where we weren\u2019t paying vendors. It took us a year to pay vendors. We had a pile of money in the bank and a wait list for HIV drugs. There was very limited testing, etc.\n\nAnd you know through force of will and very tight and focused management and oversight \u2013 we had weekly hearings of the HIV/AIDS Administration early on to turn this around. We cut our new infections in half during my eight years and deaths by 69 percent.\n\nI\u2019m the only one with a record of touching the lives of people who live east of the Anacostia River. My opponents can\u2019t point to a single thing for a quarter of our city that lives east of the Anacostia River. And my work to cut the rate of the uninsured in half had a profound impact.\n\nThe community legislation I wrote in 2006 secured ties to our tobacco settlement and produced $240 million in capital. The largest investment in primary and acute care in our city\u2019s history was under my leadership, including a $100 million investment in United Medical Center to turn that hospital around. It includes a Children\u2019s National Medical Center run pediatric emergency room on that site that sees 40,000 kids per year.\n\nI think these are historic initiatives that give people an understanding of things I care about and my approach to issues and so on.\n\nBlade: As you know, some of your critics are saying that along the way during the oversight hearings you held on a lot of these issues, including hearings on HIV/AIDS matters, you have been too abrasive in grilling the government officials who came before your committee. On the other hand, others have said they were glad you did that because some of the unresponsive bureaucrats needed a verbal kick in the pants. How do you respond in your own words to the criticism that your temperament may be a little too harsh?\n\nCatania: You know I think you should look at some of the people that were before me during those early years and see where they are now. Among my biggest supporters and contributors were the people who were on the other side. People like Shannon Hader and Dr. Pane, who was the head of the Department of Health. During this entire period Shannon Hader who was the head of the HIV/AIDS Administration \u2013 Dr. Feseha Woldu, who was the longest serving [D.C.] deputy director of health. If you look at actually the people that I worked with, they\u2019re among my biggest supporters because they appreciated that what I was doing was breaking logjams in the entire government.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t focused at the person at the table. It was focused at the entire organization. And, you know, like it or not we went from an epidemic that was uncontrolled and unresponsive to one where we have among the best data and research analysis in the country with our annual epidemiology report. What we don\u2019t have are waitlists for HIV/AIDS drugs, where we went from 8,000 to 138,000 publicly funded [HIV] tests. We went to a factor of 10 increase in publicly distributed male and female condoms. We improved the infrastructure of primary care facilities across the city. We engaged primary care physicians on how to broaden their practice of treating the epidemic \u2013 and on and on and on.\n\nAnd governing isn\u2019t easy. This is not a garden party. This is about marshaling resources. It\u2019s about constructing accountability plans; it\u2019s about pushing people until you get the results that our residents deserve.\n\nBlade: Some of the Bowser supporters are saying you\u2019re taking credit for some of the things that a lot of other people played a role in. Concerning the decline in the number of AIDS deaths they say it was due to the availability of improved drugs nationally that became available.\n\nCatania: Well it\u2019s interesting that Muriel Bowser in seven years on the Council has never mentioned HIV/AIDS once \u2013 not once. Obviously she has not mentioned or introduced a single measure on the subject. But she\u2019s not even mentioned the subject once.\n\nBlade: Do you mean while in a Council meeting?\n\nCatania: Ever \u2014 I have never heard her \u2014 there\u2019s no introductions, there\u2019s no proposals, there\u2019s never been any leadership at all from Muriel Bowser on the subject of HIV/AIDS\u2026She\u2019s had seven years on the Council and has done nothing but platitudes on anything, including HIV/AIDS. And so people have to decide for themselves. Look, I\u2019m offering myself as a leader who took the city from an epidemic and vastly improved the response by government\u2026\n\nBlade: Some in the community are saying that Carol Schwartz, Muriel Bowser and David Catania are strong supporters of the LGBT community and they\u2019re strongly committed going forward to do what they can. So therefore there is no real difference between the three of you on those issues so they should vote based on non-LGBT issues. What do you say to that?\n\nCatania: Well I think people should vote on non-LGBT issues, of course. I think people should vote on the person they believe has the best record and experience and values to secure our future. But there\u2019s a difference between rhetoric and record. In this race, only one of us championed marriage equality. Only one of us has introduced measures to secure the rights of the transgender community with the Deoni Jones Birth Certificate Equality Act. Only one of us candidly has employed a person who happens to be transgender. Only one of us has talked in a substantive way on HIV/AIDS through legislation.\n\nSo it\u2019s one thing to rhetorically say I\u2019m supportive of the community. But then when you actually look and see what has the person done? What is the record? That is a very different conversation than rhetoric. And if people are satisfied with empty gestures and rhetoric \u2014 that\u2019s one thing. But I think an empty gesture and rhetoric doesn\u2019t tackle HIV/AIDS. An empty gesture of rhetoric doesn\u2019t secure marriage equality or secure the rights of the transgender community. Empty gestures and rhetoric don\u2019t do anything. They don\u2019t accomplish anything substantively that changes the lives of everyday people \u2013 records do.\n\nBlade: Can you tell a little about your background growing up in Kansas, your early years in Washington and what you did before you ran for public office? Was it Kansas or Missouri?\n\nCatania: I spent time on both sides of the state line. I was born in Kansas City, Missouri. But I spent time on the Kansas side and the Missouri side. My mother is from a small town in Kansas \u2013 Osawatomie. And I spent my summers when I was younger there in my mother\u2019s hometown. And went to middle school and high school \u2013 most of my schooling was on the Missouri side. And then graduated from high school and came to Georgetown in the School of Foreign Service in 1986. I graduated in \u201990 and took a year off from school then into law school also at Georgetown.\n\nBlade: It\u2019s widely known that you started out as a Republican in your earlier years and you dropped your Republican affiliation in 2004. Can you respond again to the critics who are saying now that you should be viewed suspiciously because you may still have a Republican philosophy that may be at odds with the best interests of D.C.?\n\nCatania: \u2026 I think most reasonable people see my record \u2013 they see a couple of things. They see I left the party 10 years ago. And they see the fact that in my 17 years on the Council before and after I left the party I have a totality of a record that\u2019s the most progressive record in this race.\n\nIt\u2019s so progressive, in fact, that the most progressive governor in this country, Pete Shumlin (D) the governor of Vermont, supports me and endorsed me last week. Now why would the most progressive governor in the country endorse me if I were somehow at odds with his value system? And let\u2019s talk about that endorsement. Unlike many people who get an endorsement because of party affiliation where it\u2019s obligatory, Pete Shumlin and I worked together for over a decade. He was in the Senate in Vermont and I was obviously a member of the Council here.\n\nAnd I chaired this national legislative association on prescription drug prices. And we would see each other throughout the year \u2013 quarterly visits \u2013 sometimes more. And for 10 years we worked on a whole host of issues that were ultimately folded into the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSo this is a person who knows me inside out for 10 years and he has endorsed me and essentially has told the residents of this city that I have the most progressive democratic values in this race\u2026\n\nIt is true that I was a Republican until 2004. The Republican Party that I grew up in and grew with is a very different party than it is now and a different party than it was in \u201904. I was active in the party in part because I wanted to bring it toward the center and I wanted to make it relevant for issues that people in cities confront.\n\nAnd as a result I worked with the Republican Main Street Partnership and fought with Congressman Steve Gunderson who came out [as gay] and then left Congress. And we were looking at how we can improve and broaden the party\u2019s base and be more moderate. And ultimately we weren\u2019t successful. And it was made clear to me that I wasn\u2019t going to be successful in that effort when President Bush announced the amendment to ban same-sex marriage.\n\nAnd so that was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. It wasn\u2019t the only issue. It was a long series of issues. And I invite you to talk to my ex \u2013 Brian Kearney. He went with me \u2013 when we went to Crawford [Texas in 2003] it was for a particular purpose. It wasn\u2019t to fawn on the president. It was to raise issues that relate to cities. It was to talk about LGBT issues, to talk about housing and cities. And it was to have a voice at the table. In order to have a voice at the table with these kinds of leaders you have to do things like raise money. And you hope that once you have a voice at the table you can moderate and change the party. I tried it. It was unsuccessful. But that was 10 years ago.\n\nBlade: On some of the issues that will be coming up, you have said you will not say whether you will retain the public schools chancellor and the police chief until after the election. Is that your position?\n\nCatania: We haven\u2019t had an election. I think engaging in personnel items before an election is premature. Where does it end? I for one think the respectful thing to do is \u2013 these individuals presently have a boss. There\u2019s no successor until there\u2019s an election. And their boss is the mayor.\n\nLook at the public safety issue. I have a great deal of respect for Chief Lanier. And I called her after I received the endorsement of the FOP [D.C. police union] and I said I want you to know that once I\u2019m elected I hope you and I can sit down and talk about your future here because I have a great deal of respect for you.\n\nAll indications, of course, are why would I not keep her? I told her look you\u2019re the chief of police. The mayor is your boss. And to have candidates compete for you or to have these conversations in the meantime I think it clouds the chain of command.\n\nAnd the same is true for the chancellor. I\u2019ve had a great relationship with her. I look forward to talking to her after I win on the issue of whether she is willing to stay and under what terms and conditions is she willing to stay? I just think these discussions before an election are premature.\n\nBlade: In terms of the chief, you may know, there has been some friction among some in the LGBT community and the chief ever since she was appointed by Mayor Fenty over the Gay and Lesbian Liaison Unit. The head of the police division that oversees the GLLU was just transferred after a member of the GLLU filed a complaint against him for calling him Justine when his name is Justin. If you were mayor how would you handle a situation like that? Even if you didn\u2019t want to replace the chief do you see yourself playing some role in departmental policies?\n\nCatania: The mayor is not going to be getting into and should not be getting into issues like who should be the 8th grade biology teacher\u2026There are certain things where you hire good people and you trust their judgment. When they give you reason not to trust their good judgment you have conversations with them going forward. Without knowing the whole detail I\u2019m not going to comment on this particular issue.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s safe to say that if the chief has a member of the LGBT community as the mayor the chief will be particularly sensitive of the LGBT community, among others \u2013 not exclusively obviously but I think it will color the way in which this issue is handled. Going forward obviously there will be zero tolerance of violations of our city\u2019s Human Rights Act.\n\nBlade: You\u2019ve been asked this before. Everybody familiar with the city knows we\u2019ve never had a non-Democratic mayor, we\u2019ve never had a white mayor, and certainly we\u2019ve never had an out gay mayor. So you have a number of what some say could be hurdles to go through. Do you see the demographics of the city changing so these hurdles could be overcome?\n\nCatania: I think the people want the best mayor. I think the majority \u2013 there will always be people who have points of view who can\u2019t check their prejudice. I think the majority of the people want the best mayor. And so they want a mayor with experience and values and vision. I have a 126-page vision statement that goes into detail about how I intend to lead our city and the priorities that I have for the city.\n\nI\u2019m the only one in the race with a progressive record of substance. And I think that progressive record resonates across the board with all demographics in our city. I\u2019ve won five races citywide. I\u2019ve made friends in every corner of the city. And I have delivered for every corner of the city. And when people go into the voting booths they are asking themselves do they want a mayor who can deliver and who has delivered and who knows where he or she is going to take the city? Do they want values or do they want labels?\n\nThis is an election where my record contrasts with my opponents\u2019 rhetoric. And of things that matter to your readers, on more things than not, I think they are more closely aligned to me than they are my opponents. I\u2019m appealing to all voters. And we have support from all voters\u2026\n\nAnd I think people are kind of sick and tired of the machine in this city. And it\u2019s a machine that has governed this city to its own benefit that has given up on the idea of ideas and governs by trying to cajole people in some instances and intimidate them in others to vote for their candidate. And I think people want a fresh start. They want a new leader, a leader with vision, a leader who has done things on their behalf.\n\nAnd I think it would be historic just as it was historic in 1997 when I became the first openly LGBT member of the Council. That was historic. I think people thought, \u2018Oh gosh he\u2019s going to be the openly LGBT Council member.\u2019 And we dispensed with that notion quickly and people saw me as someone who is a fighter for the people of our city across demographics, across the city. And that\u2019s exactly the kind of mayor I\u2019ll be.\n\nSo any time you take on the establishment \u2013 and I\u2019m clearly the anti-establishment candidate. I am clearly not part of this machine, nor have I ever been nor would I ever aspire to be a part of the machine. That\u2019s not meant to be pejorative to a particular party. It is in this city we have a machine and I don\u2019t want to be a part of that machine. I want to see things that aren\u2019t right and I want to make them right.\n\nBlade: You\u2019ve said in the past that your upbringing in Kansas played some role in you becoming a Republican. Can you tell a little about that?\n\nCatania: I grew up playing in the John Brown State Park. We were all very proud of the abolitionist tradition, the Lincoln Republican tradition. It was deeply embedded in who we were. But it was a different party than the one that exists now and existed 10 or 12 or over 20 years ago. If you\u2019re from a small town and you\u2019re deeply part of that \u2013 the roots of that community, you know, it\u2019s hard to let go of those roots and those labels.\n\nI grew up with labels that were extraordinarily progressive \u2013 I mean the values that were extraordinarily progressive\u2026\n\nAnd so my mother\u2019s hometown was a very proud tiny community that has a history that was hard to let go of. And that\u2019s why maybe I worked so hard to try to make the party what it represented to me as a child and as a young person.\n\nBut again, I\u2019ve had a pretty incredible life. How many kids can come from a single mother without a 10th grade education as a gay person? And all these other things people look at as barriers I look at as opportunities \u2013 and to come and stand before and be a serious candidate to lead their nation\u2019s capital \u2013 it\u2019s a miracle, it\u2019s a miracle.\n\nAnd so I am an eternally optimistic person. So when people try \u2013 I mean who as a gay person, who among us \u2013 we have all been tormented. So there are people in our community and some who will try to torment me one way or another. But I\u2019ve been tormented for a good part of my life and I used that as a fire \u2013 candidly \u2013 to see things that are wrong and try to make them right.\n\nSo you know passion and anger \u2013 not in a mean-spirited way \u2013 but passion and anger are necessary components of great leaders. You cannot \u2013 unless there is that eternal fire in the belly \u2013 that quest to make things right that sustains you in good times and in bad.\n\nAnd so you ask how are you going to win? You are all of these things. You are a duck-billed platypus and you\u2019re all this other stuff. People who view me through those lenses miss what America is. The vast majority of the people in this city understand what America is. They will judge me on myself and my record and can they trust me and have I delivered for them.\n\nBlade: When you mentioned being tormented in your younger years did you mean anti-gay bullying and that sort of thing?\n\nCatania: Well listen, no more than anyone else. I mean all of us have been called faggot. If you can find a gay person in their 50s or 40s in this country that hasn\u2019t been called a faggot or worse \u2013 but it\u2019s how you respond that matters. And my life made me stronger. It made me what I am.\n\nBlade: Can you respond to the issue that Carol Schwartz has been raising in the recent debates \u2013 that your decision to work in outside jobs during your tenure on the Council at a law firm and later with a construction company that has city contracts are problematic.\n\nCatania: I\u2019m not responding to her in particular. But I think what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re hiring this city\u2019s mayor. We\u2019re hiring a mayor, a chief executive. And I think it\u2019s absolutely necessary to look at the totality of our experiences. Until the end of 2012 I was vice president of corporate strategy for one of the most innovative, fastest growing design build companies in the East Coast \u2013 3,000 employees and 30 offices around the world.\n\nAnd I was responsible for everything from compliance to legal affairs to organizational development. And so as you look at the candidates and say, \u2018Oh gosh, who here can run an $11 billion outfit, which is the size of our government of 30,000 employees? Who here has a clue as to actually running a government or to run an organization?\u2019 And I\u2019m the only one in this race who has done it.\n\nLet me give you an example as to why it\u2019s important. One of the things I was responsible for \u2013 and I mention this all the time on the campaign trail \u2013 I was responsible for organizational development. The tenets of how you build a great organization are these. It\u2019s how you recruit your workforce, how you educate your workforce, how you evaluate your workforce, how you promote your workforce, how you retain your workforce. In other words building a great organization is indispensable if you intend to accomplish anything. You simply can\u2019t take a disjointed, dysfunctional entity and expect it\u2019s going to deliver once you make a pronouncement.\n\nNeither of my principal opponents have ever been part of running an organization, let alone a multi-national organization with 3,000 employees where we had to get up every day and make sure we were meeting our customers\u2019 needs and we were being innovative and creative and competitive.\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I would take my experience that includes everything from water projects in Panama to cyber security in Europe \u2013 I would take my experiences and I would think they would apply quite nicely when it comes to running a government.\n\nNow in campaigns people always try to take cheap shots. The fact is the company I worked for \u2013 the contracts it had were always less than 2 percent of the company\u2019s total contracts \u2013 always. They were always competitively bid. I recused myself from all matters involving the contracts \u2013 votes and otherwise. So trust me, if anyone had any goods on me picking up the phone on behalf of that company \u2014 that would have been dimed out long ago.\n\nCarol says, \u2018Well our budgets include the money.\u2019 That\u2019s true. We do approve budgets. But then we do contracts on how we spend them. And on those contracts I recused myself at every time.\n\nBut I had a top-secret security clearance with this company. I went through a thorough investigation by the National Industry Security Program that gave me a top-secret security clearance. I was up to my elbows in national security issues because of the work we did with our government contractors. The notion that the company would lose the livelihoods of 3,000 people for a contract in this city or to do anything nefarious is just a joke. So I am really not responding to that.\n\nI have the experience and the values and the vision to secure our city\u2019s future and I intend to be the next mayor of this city. And I think having an LGBTQ mayor is a very powerful international symbol because it\u2019s a symbol of what America is. We are a place where there is equality of opportunity \u2013 where there is fairness when people play by the rules. I intend to be the mayor of our city. I intend to be an LGBTQ symbol. And I intend to use my office to point out things that are wrong in this world.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Catania, 46, and his supporters \u2013 both gay and straight \u2013 argue that a careful assessment of his 17-year record on the City Council would convince voters...", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights", "description": "Catania, 46, and his supporters \u2013 both gay and straight \u2013 argue that a careful assessment of his 17-year record on the City Council would convince voters...", "title": "Catania: \u2018I\u2019m best qualified to be mayor\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 460, "identifier": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2014/10/David_Catania_460x470_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "height": 470}, "updated_time": "2014-10-22T14:51:26-04:00", "url": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/2014/10/22/catania-im-best-qualified-mayor/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Catania, 46, and his supporters \u2013 both gay and straight \u2013 argue that a careful assessment of his 17-year record on the City Council would convince voters...", "creator": "@WashBlade", "image": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2014/10/David_Catania_460x470_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "title": "Catania: \u2018I\u2019m best qualified to be mayor\u2019", "site": "@WashBlade", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 13357499221}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WashingtonBlade", "section": "homepage news", "tag": "Supreme Court", "published_time": "2014-10-22T14:50:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-22T14:51:26-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ACA, Affordable Care Act, AIDS, Carol Schwartz, Cathy Lanier, Children's National Medical Center, D.C., David Catania, Democratic Party, District of Columbia"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbadc\"", "article_summary": "Everybody familiar with the city knows we\u2019ve never had a non-Democratic mayor, we\u2019ve never had a white mayor, and certainly we\u2019ve never had an out gay mayor.\nAnd I\u2019m running for mayor for the same reason I ran for Council in 1997.\nAnd I think having an LGBTQ mayor is a very powerful international symbol because it\u2019s a symbol of what America is.\nThe Republican Party that I grew up in and grew with is a very different party than it is now and a different party than it was in \u201904.\nI\u2019m the only one with a record of touching the lives of people who live east of the Anacostia River."}
