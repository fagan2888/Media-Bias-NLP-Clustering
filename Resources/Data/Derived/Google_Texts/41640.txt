A recent New York Times article compared President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act rollout to former President George Bush's Hurricane Katrina response:

The disastrous rollout of his health care law not only threatens the rest of his agenda but also raises questions about his competence in the same way that the Bush administration's botched response to Hurricane Katrina undermined any semblance of Republican efficiency.

But that's exactly why the Part D comparison makes so much more sense, and the Katrina comparison is so misguided -- and so offensive. The reason the Bush administration could never wipe away the stain of Katrina was that the victims were dead. There was only one chance to get the response right, and the consequences of failure were irreparable. The Affordable Care Act, by contrast, might fail in November, but if it works come December, or January, it can go on to be a hugely successful, popular program.

But an editorial in the Washington Post declares that the two should stop being compared, arguing that the Bush administration's Medicare Part D offers a more ready analogue to Obamacare:

"The difference between the almost right word and the right word is really a large matter-it's the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning," Mark Twain once wrote in a letter. Analogies, like similar words, are by their very nature, imperfect. That said, just how imperfect is the Obamacare-Hurricane Katrina analogy? Not far off the mark? Or do you think it's totally flawed?
