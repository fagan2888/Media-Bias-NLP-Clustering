Paul Clement said voters may not \u201ccut out\u201d a state\u2019s lawmakers and give the power to \u201can unelected and unaccountable commission.\u201d\n\nIf the court\u2019s majority agrees \u2014 which appeared likely based on the justices\u2019 responses \u2014 the ruling would strike down numerous congressional districts in Arizona and California that were drawn by nonpartisan citizen commissions.\n\nIt also would deal a setback to reformers who see independent commissions as the best weapon to stop politicians from manipulating electoral district lines to protect incumbents or political fiefdoms.\n\nCalifornia elects 53 members to the House of Representatives. The delegation, currently 38 Democrats and 15 Republicans, is the largest in Congress.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s voters approved the Voters First Act in 2008 to create the Citizens Redistricting Commission for state Legislature seats. Two years later, voters approved a second measure to extend its authority to congressional districts.\n\nLeading Republicans in California, including former Govs. Pete Wilson, George Deukmejian and Arnold Schwarzenegger, strongly backed the commission plan. The Republican leaders filed a friend-of-the-court brief to the Supreme Court highlighting the history of Democratic dominance in Sacramento and urging the court to uphold Arizona\u2019s commission.\n\nDistricts drawn by California\u2019s commission left Democrats with a solid hold on the congressional delegation. But the redrawn districts also forced two senior House Democrats to fight for a seat from the San Fernando Valley in 2012. In that race, Rep. Brad Sherman defeated veteran Rep. Howard Berman.\n\nVoters in Arizona adopted a ballot measure in 2000 to create a five-member independent commission for redistricting.\n\nThe state elects nine members to the House, currently five Republicans and four Democrats. Several of the seats are closely contested under lines drawn by the state commission.\n\nA Supreme Court ruling in the Arizona case should not prevent independent panels from drawing districts for state legislators who serve in Sacramento or Phoenix. Clement argued that state legislators ultimately thus reflect popular views.\n\n\u201cIf these commissions are as effective as my friends on the other side say, then we will have nonpartisan districts that will elect the statehouse \u2026 and these perfectly representative bodies will be the ones to take care of congressional redistricting,\u201d he said.\n\nLawyers on both sides agreed that states may rely on \u201cadvisory\u201d commissions to help draw election maps so long as legislators have the final word.\n\nReformers argue that giving the power to political operatives is the real problem. A party in control of the statehouse can redraw districts to ensure safe seats for its members.\n\nThe practice has a long political lineage. The term gerrymandering dates to 1812, when a supposedly salamander-shaped state Senate district in Massachusetts was created to help elect supporters of Gov. Elbridge Gerry.\n\nThe case heard Monday will hinge on whether the court decides that the Constitution reserves redistricting solely to state legislatures.\n\nClement pointed to a clause that says, \u201cThe times, places and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.\u201d\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia said this refers to elected lawmakers only. Arizona, by contrast, \u201cis giving this power to an unelected body of five people,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the liberal justices said the word \u201clegislature\u201d can be understood broadly to refer to the state\u2019s lawmaking process.\n\nFor example, a governor may veto a bill passed by the legislature. And in California and Arizona, the state constitution makes clear that the voters may change the law through initiatives.\n\nJustices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor said the court should defer to the states on how they divide up power, rather than impose a rule from Washington.\n\nWith the justices split along ideological lines, the outcome probably depends on Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a Sacramento native who is very familiar with California politics.\n\nKennedy asked skeptical questions of attorneys for both sides. But at one point he said constitutional history strongly suggested the word \u201clegislature\u201d referred only to the elected lawmakers.\n\nIf the court agrees with Clement, it would affect other election laws passed through ballot measures.\n\n\u201cThis case could be really significant\u201d by raising legal doubts about all manner of election rules, said Justin Levitt, an election-law expert at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.\n\nThe justices will rule in the case of Arizona State Legislature vs. Arizona Redistricting Commission by the summer.\n\ndavid.savage@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @DavidGSavage", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Supreme Court skeptical of citizen panels that redraw congressional districts", "Description": "The future of California\u2019s effort to entrust a nonpartisan citizens\u2019 panel with redrawing the state\u2019s congressional districts appeared in serious doubt Monday after arguments in the Supreme Court.
