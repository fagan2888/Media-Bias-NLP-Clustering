You\u2019ll likely collect hundreds if not thousands of unused clips. It\u2019s also very likely that, while so many unused binder clips were scattered around your office, many new boxes of clips were purchased when employees couldn\u2019t find them in the supply area.\n\nThe excess expenses related to being an employer stay hidden in your company like binder clips because waste can\u2019t be discovered until you go looking for it. It\u2019s possible, however, that by scrutinizing and better classifying your costs, you could reduce expenses related to employment significantly.\n\nSmart Business spoke with William F. Hutter, CEO of Sequent, about how looking closer at employment-related expenses could save companies considerable money.\n\nHow does improper categorization lead to greater expenses?\n\nIt\u2019s becoming critically important as employers\u2019 costs increase to look for new ways to save money. It\u2019s often the case that expenses directly related to employees are inadvertently hidden in the profit and loss statements, because they are improperly categorized.\n\nEmployers tend to look at taxes, workers\u2019 compensation and health insurance and mistakenly believe that\u2019s all of the employee expenses they have. In truth, for every dollar spent on wages there are costs over and above those that employers either can\u2019t or choose not to identify. For instance, let\u2019s say an employer pays for an outside expert to help with Affordable Care Act (ACA) reporting requirements. Where does that expense get tallied? Often it\u2019s reported as a one-time vendor expense, but it\u2019s really an employee expense.\n\nAs compliance issues continue to pile up, it will become more important to identify these expenses.\n\nWhat do employers miss when it comes to the cost of employment?\n\nThere are many expenses directly related to employees that are often improperly classified. Those can include:\n\nThe cost of new hire reporting to the state to determine if there are wage garnishments that should be served against new employees.\n\nTraining, whether mandated or required.\n\nEmployment records management.\n\nRecruiting efforts.\n\nUnemployment or workers\u2019 compensation hearings.\n\nRecords storage.\n\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act compliance work.\n\nCreating plan documents.\n\nRequired ACA notifications that must be printed and mailed to employees.\n\nDepending upon the source cited, the cost of being an employer and meeting all the compliance guidelines could be $5,000 per employee. Knowing the source of those expenses is the first step to bringing those costs down.\n\nHow can employers better account for all employee-related expenses?\n\nCompanies seem willing to spend a lot of time negotiating the lease for their copiers, scrutinizing it down to what they pay per page printed to try and save as much as possible. But considering that employee expenses, including wages, are likely 60 to 70 percent of a company\u2019s gross profits, it would appear that it\u2019s a better use of resources to identify the sources of those expenses and work to control them.\n\nTo get a better sense of what is being spent on employees, identify the areas of spending so the costs can be managed. Many times those spending areas are spread across multiple areas or even among several vendor relationships, so employers need a strategy to manage that in a comprehensive fashion.\n\nVery large companies have vendor management departments, which may or may not be an internal department \u2014 it could be contracted out to an independent company. These exist so these companies can begin to control all the various expenses that go out of the building by multiple decision-makers spent with third parties. While your company may not have the resources for such a dedicated department, committing time to equating specific costs to employee expenditures gives credence to the task. Identifying expenses can help a company better manage them.\n\nInsights HR Outsourcing is brought to you by Sequent", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Smart Business Magazine", "description": "The excess expenses related to being an employer stay hidden in your company because waste can\u2019t be discovered until you go looking for it.
