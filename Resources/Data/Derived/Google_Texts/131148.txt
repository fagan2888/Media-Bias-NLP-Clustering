An estimated 8,000 to 10,000 fans of anime, sci-fi, fantasy, horror and comic books flocked to the Kentucky International Convention Center on Saturday for the 10th annual Fandom Fest convention. People from all over the country came to peruse and pick up memorabilia, catch a glimpse of favorite celebrities and meet other costumed devotees.

The gathering is a convergence of thousands with an interest in entertainment genres slightly off the beaten path.

"People are as weird as I am â€¦ it's awesome! Nobody thinks I'm strange here," fantasy author Mysti Parker said, carrying an archer's bow nearly as tall as she is.

Thousands of artistic wares were for sale and people lined up to meet sci-fi heroes such as Brent Spiner and LeVar Burton of "Star Trek" fame.

Other attendees said getting in touch with other fans and enthusiasts was their favorite part of the show.

"One of the best things is meeting people," said Shawn Dolphin of Louisville, dressed as Thor.

Fandom Fest began as the horror film series Fright Night Film Fest and has steadily expanded into the convention it is today. It continues Sunday.
