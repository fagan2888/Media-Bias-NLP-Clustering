Global sales have fallen 2.5 percent in July, the AP reported.\n\nThe food scandal that occurred last month involved expired meat being repackaged at a Chinese food supplier that sends products to McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks, Burger King, and other international chains. The company in question, OSI Group, reportedly knew the meat was expired but changed the labels in order to deceive the restaurants it was supplying. McDonald\u2019s restaurants in both China and Japan had to remove various items, such as Chicken McNuggets and Big Macs, from their menus.\n\n\u201cWe do feel we were a bit deceived relative to one of these plants,\u201d Don Thompson, CEO of McDonald\u2019s, told USA Today when the scandal occurred.\n\nOther restaurants who had relied on OSI Group for food products quickly cut ties after the incident, such as Yum Brands, the owner of both KFC and Pizza Hut. McDonald\u2019s isn\u2019t the only fast food chain to see a drop in sales: most of these restaurants have been a bit beaten down after the scandal. The AP notes that McDonald\u2019s has been struggling to keep sales up in the U.S. due to \u201cintensifying competition and shifting eating habits.\u201d If McDonald\u2019s global sales for 2014 drops because of this, it will be the first time the company sees a decline in sales since 2002 \u2014 and that might be a good thing.\n\nLast week, OSI chairman Sheldon Lavin announced that individual employees were to blame for the expired meat incident, but that the company accepted responsibility. However, Sebastien Breteau, CEO of AsiaInspection, noted that \u201cit seems that it was not an accident but a hidden practice, which is really bad,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cIt means that in management, they had not put in place what they had to. It was not properly audited.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., McDonald\u2019s has attempted to ride the wave of healthy eating by adding new items to its menu, that provide a more balanced, nutritious meal for the average American. There\u2019s the \u201cFavorites Under 400\u201d menu, which provides a variety of meals under 400 calories, like the Egg McMuffin or Filet-O-Fish, as well as salads, oatmeal, yogurt parfait, and medium fries. But these are apparently not quite making it the cut, as many health-minded Americans are turning to other healthy food options instead. Chipotle, for example, offers more wholesome ingredients and doesn't have the same \"junk food\" stigma that McDonald's holds.\n\nIt turns out that many Chinese consumers are even more turned off by fast food now than before. \u201cAs everybody says, fast food is junk food, unhealthy,\u201d a KFC customer in Beijing told the AP. \u201cI will eat at fast food restaurants even less in the future.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mcdonald's, meat scandal, expired meat, mcdonald's sales", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "As if fast food wasn\u2019t disturbing enough, consumers around the world are becoming less inclined to eat at McDonald\u2019s after an expired meat scandal in China.", "title": "McDonald\u2019s Sales Plummet After Expired Meat Scandal", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mcdonalds-sales-drop-after-china-expired-meat-scandal-also-because-shifting-eating-habits-297262", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/hamburger.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As if fast food wasn\u2019t disturbing enough, consumers around the world are becoming less inclined to eat at McDonald\u2019s after an expired meat scandal in China.", "title": "McDonald\u2019s Sales Plummet After Expired Meat Scandal", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/mcdonalds-sales-drop-after-china-expired-meat-scandal-also-because-shifting-eating-habits-297262", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/hamburger.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/08/hamburger.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-09T10:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-09T10:01:51-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "As if fast food wasn\u2019t disturbing enough, consumers around the world are becoming less inclined to eat at McDonald\u2019s after an expired meat scandal in China."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad6a\"", "article_summary": "McDonald\u2019s restaurants in both China and Japan had to remove various items, such as Chicken McNuggets and Big Macs, from their menus.\nMcDonald\u2019s is seeing a drop in sales after suffering a marketing blow from a meat scandal in China, as well as persistent weakness in the U.S. market.\n\u201cI will eat at fast food restaurants even less in the future.\u201d\nThe food scandal that occurred last month involved expired meat being repackaged at a Chinese food supplier that sends products to McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks, Burger King, and other international chains.\nIt turns out that many Chinese consumers are even more turned off by fast food now than before."}
