Boehner of Ohio said in brief remarks before affixing his signature to the legislation.\n\nBut as members of Congress go home for their first extended break since Republicans took control Jan. 6, they have few other achievements.\n\nOnly two bills have become law \u2014 one a leftover from last year that funds a terrorism insurance program important to real estate developers, the other a noncontroversial measure to address mental health problems among veterans.\n\nThat compares with six new laws at this point in 2007, when Democrats came to power in both chambers for the final two years of President George W. Bush's tenure.\n\nThe new Republican majority, said one lawmaker granted anonymity to speak openly about their work, is like the dog that caught the car \u2014 still figuring out what to do next. Rather than begin the year with an agreed-upon strategy or comprehensive agenda for the party in power, the 114th Congress opened last month with a loosely defined set of legislative priorities.\n\nEven the Keystone bill was passed only after an exhaustive process in the Senate. During the course of the debate, more amendments were discussed and dispensed with than in the entire previous year when Democrats were in charge.\n\nIn the meantime, however, gas prices plummeted, leaving some analysts to question whether the pipeline project would still pencil out.\n\n\"Is it the most important piece of legislation facing the nation? No. But it is an opportunity for us to prove that we're able to work with each other and govern, and it is a good test of whether or not the president is interested in doing that as well,\" said Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.). \"We have to learn how to crawl before we can walk, and walk before we can run.\"\n\nThey'll have to walk quickly. When lawmakers return to Washington in a little more than a week, they'll once again face something Republicans had hoped to leave behind them \u2014 the possibility of a partial government shutdown.\n\nThe shutdown threat stems from a legislative trap Republicans set for themselves last December after Obama moved to shield up to 5 million people in the country illegally from the possibility of deportation. At the behest of conservatives eager to undo the new policy, lawmakers agreed not to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which handles immigration among other duties, past Feb. 27.\n\nRepublican leaders struggled for most of the last six weeks to find a way forward before the Homeland Security money runs out. They initially hoped a few Senate Democrats who have qualms about Obama's immigration plans might join them on a bill that would fund the department and overturn the president's executive action.\n\nBut Democrats have remained united in blocking any such plan. Republicans, with 54 senators, would need six Democrats to break ranks to end a filibuster of the bill.\n\nThe party's disarray about what to do next could be seen over the last several days as Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) exchanged barbs over who was to blame for the impasse.\n\nSome Republicans in the House suggested their Senate counterparts overturn the chamber's filibuster rules to get the bill through.\n\n\"We understand what the math is. But they have procedural rules that they can change,\" said Rep. Raul R. Labrador (R-Idaho).\n\nSenate Republicans, who had angrily objected when Democrats did away with the filibuster for confirming most nominations, immediately shot down as unworkable the idea of wiping out legislative filibusters as well.\n\nInternal Republican disagreements have flared along other traditional fault lines, such as abortion, derailing bills that the GOP leadership had hoped would notch some early victories.\n\nThe House has passed dozens of bills in its six weeks, including a repeal of Obamacare as well as measures on taxes and abortion.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) wrote to colleagues Friday. He trumpeted the \"unprecedented\" output and noted that many of the bills drew bipartisan support.\n\n\"Despite a few detours along the way, we should be proud of what we've accomplished,\" he wrote.\n\nMany of those bills, however, mirror measures that passed in the last Congress only to collect dust in the Democratic-controlled Senate. House Republicans have hoped that their proposals will do better with Republicans in the Senate majority for the first time in eight years.\n\nSo far, however, McConnell has seemed more concerned with restoring a more freewheeling but slow-moving legislative grind than with delivering legislative victories.\n\nEven when Republicans have been able to stick to their shared priorities \u2014 approval of the Keystone legislation, for example \u2014 they are running into the power of the White House veto threat.\n\nBut all along, Republicans have said they should be judged not by their debut, but by the next few months of grueling legislating.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Republican majorities struggle to get Congress working", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "After six weeks in session and 139 roll call votes in a House and Senate that feature some of the largest Republican majorities in generations, one of the most telling statistics from the new Congress is this: President Obama 's veto threats outnumber the bills Congress has been able to send him.", "title": "Republican majorities struggle to get Congress working", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-gop-congress-assessment-20150215-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54e02d1a/turbine/la-na-gop-congress-assessment-20150215", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp10.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Congress, House, Senate, Republican majorities", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82822776", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-02-15", "Description": "Republicans, now in control of both chambers of Congress, have run into old obstacles like partisan paralysis and GOP infighting.", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Congress, House, Senate, Republican majorities"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2052\"", "article_summary": "House Republicans have hoped that their proposals will do better with Republicans in the Senate majority for the first time in eight years.\nBut as members of Congress go home for their first extended break since Republicans took control Jan. 6, they have few other achievements.\nMany of those bills, however, mirror measures that passed in the last Congress only to collect dust in the Democratic-controlled Senate.\nSome Republicans in the House suggested their Senate counterparts overturn the chamber's filibuster rules to get the bill through.\nAfter six weeks in session and 139 roll call votes in a House and Senate that feature some of the largest Republican majorities in generations, one of the most telling statistics from the new Congress is this: President Obama's veto threats outnumber the bills Congress has been able to send him."}
