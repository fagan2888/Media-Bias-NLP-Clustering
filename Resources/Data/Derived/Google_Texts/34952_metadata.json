The Aussie DJ and producer is among the world\u2019s best, having recently landed herself a residency at hip new Las Vegas super club Drai\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to be the best I can be,\u201d Helena told Confidential.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hands on. I\u2019m very technical and I play across four decks. I\u2019m all about the music.\u201d\n\nHelena, 28, whose last name is Atherton, was born in the UK but grew up in Melbourne.\n\nShe\u2019s lived in Sydney for most of the past decade and recently moved to LA where she\u2019s quickly shot up the international ranks and is now the first Australian female DJ to earn a residency in Vegas.\n\nDJ Helena loves the big events. Picture: Shane O'Neal.\n\nDJ Helena was named in the line-up for Belgium\u2019s Tomorrowland Music Festival. Picture: Shane O'Neal.\n\nJust a few days ago, Helena was named in the line-up for Belgium\u2019s Tomorrowland Music Festival, regarded the biggest electronic music fest in the world.\n\nHelena began learning to DJ at 14 and is known for playing big room house.\n\nShe recently signed a global record deal with Sony Music.\n\n\u201cI want to be a staple name at all these big festivals,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be playing alongside every big DJ in the world.\u201d\n\nAside from herself, the other biggest Australian female DJ act is the Nervo twins.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of female acts in the market but not really many at the moment that have broken through.\u201d\n\nWhy?\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s because girls haven\u2019t nailed the production to be quite honest,\u201d she said candidly.\n\n\u201cThese promoters are not going to give you a gig just because you\u2019re a girl. It is about the music.\u201d\n\nHelena says that the main reason women don\u2019t seem to have made as big an impact on the industry is \u2018because girls haven\u2019t nailed the production to be quite honest'. Picture: Shane O'Neil.\n\nAlthough diplomatic, she agreed there was a trend of both male and females calling themselves DJs without actually having the skill to be one.\n\n\u201cOf course but you have that in a lot of sectors,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou have people who play pre mixed CDs and stand around and call themselves a DJ. It\u2019s like, are they a DJ or are they a performer, it\u2019s a fine line between it all.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "description": "HELENA is the real deal.
