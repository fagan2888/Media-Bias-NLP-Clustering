Professional Institute of Agriculture and Environment \"Cettolini\" of Cagliari\n\nBritish scientists recently sought approval to release thousands of genetically modified olive flies in Spain as an experimental pest-control alternative to chemical pesticides. If approved, the trial will be first of its kind on European soil.\n\nPioneered by Oxford-based biotech firm Oxitec, the experiment uses sterile insect technique (SIT) to reduce the numbers of olive flies, considered a pestilence to olive crops. Genetically modified (GM) olive fly males are released into the environment, where they mate with wild olive females. Their resulting offspring would be infertile, so the flies--wild and GM--fail to proliferate.\n\nIn theory and controlled greenhouse experiments, the concept is a success. Laboratory experiments have shown that the olive fly population could be eliminated in about two months. SIT was designed so that all the genetically modified organisms would die off and not continue to mate. Also, since olive flies only mate with olive flies, only the targeted species would be affected. Chemical pesticides, in contrast, linger and can affect a broad array of organisms.\n\n\u201cBy using our form of genetic sterility our flies are designed to eliminate the pest and not to stay in the environment.\u201d Dr. Martha Koukidou, lead investigator from Oxitec, said.\n\nThe flies have wiped out several harvests in recent years, according to Paul di Calabiana Willan, a olivefarmer from Northern Italy. The fly has resulted in major financial losses.\n\n\u201cThe main weapon against the olive fly is a chemical which has been banned in some countries,\u201d de Calabiana Willan said in an Oxitec press release. \u201c\u2018In my view the use of GM insects to eradicate this pest is a necessary step towards achieving zero pesticide use.\u201d\n\nIf the trials are successful, the scientists hope to test the olive flies in British fields in Greece and Italy next.\n\nOxitec's Genetically Modified Insects Draw Criticism\n\nLike all things genetically modified, the advent of the \"Frankenfly\" is met with criticism. Even with the olive flies killed, their genetically modified bodies remain, which can make their way into food products and the human body. Little is known about the dangers posed by ingesting genetically modified olive flies, as with other genetically modified materials.\n\n\u201cOxitec\u2019s experiments should not go ahead until rules for safety testing and plans for labeling and segregation of contaminated fruits have been thoroughly debated and assessed,\u201d Dr. Helen Wallace, director of GeneWatch UK, told the Daily Mail. \u201cIf these issues are ignored, growers could suffer serious impacts on the market for their crops.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first occasion in which Oxitec had drawn a mix of praise and criticism for its methods. The firm has used the sterile insect technique on the dengue-carrying mosquito Aedes aegypti to reduce levels of the tropical and sometimes fatal disease. Recently, a trial in Brazil showed a 96 percent suppression of the dengue vector.\n\nEfforts to test Oxitec\u2019s genetically modified mosquitoes in the Florida Keys in 2012 incensed residents, causing a delay in testing. Many raised environmental and ecological concerns, pointing to holes in SIT technology.\n\nFriends of the Earth, an environmental policy group, claims that some of the genetically modified insects could continue to breed. While Oxitec only plans to release males, up to 0.5 percent of the released insects are female, as the released mosquitoes are handpicked by scientists, prone to human error.\n\nFurthermore, the genetically modified offspring, designed by scientists to be sterile, are still subject to invisible forces governing evolution, and could evolve to be fertile.\n\nAs Jeff Goldblum\u2019s character famously put in the film Jurassic Park, in which a fictional dinosaur population comprised solely of females manages to produce offspring, \u201cLife finds a way.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "genetically modified insects, pesticide, oxitec", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Oxitec's sterile insect technique of releasing genetically modified insects into crop fields is welcomed by some farmers and scientists, but critics say the technology has its faults and may pose health risks.", "title": "Genetically Modified Insects As An Alternative To Pesticides Raise Health Concerns", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/genetically-modified-insects-proposed-alternative-chemical-pesticides-raise-health-concerns-255956", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/07/olive-fly.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Oxitec's sterile insect technique of releasing genetically modified insects into crop fields is welcomed by some farmers and scientists, but critics say the technology has its faults and may pose health risks.", "title": "Genetically Modified Insects As An Alternative To Pesticides Raise Health Concerns", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/genetically-modified-insects-proposed-alternative-chemical-pesticides-raise-health-concerns-255956", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/07/olive-fly.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/07/olive-fly.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2013-09-07T14:41:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-07T16:26:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Oxitec's sterile insect technique of releasing genetically modified insects into crop fields is welcomed by some farmers and scientists, but critics say the technology has its faults and may pose health risks."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe19f7\"", "article_summary": "Oxitec's Genetically Modified Insects Draw CriticismLike all things genetically modified, the advent of the \"Frankenfly\" is met with criticism.\nLittle is known about the dangers posed by ingesting genetically modified olive flies, as with other genetically modified materials.\nAlso, since olive flies only mate with olive flies, only the targeted species would be affected.\nGenetically modified male olive flies are used as an alternative to chemical pesticides, prompting many to question their safety.\nFriends of the Earth, an environmental policy group, claims that some of the genetically modified insects could continue to breed."}
