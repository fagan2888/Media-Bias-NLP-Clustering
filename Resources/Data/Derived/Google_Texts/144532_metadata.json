With each division, the telomere shortens, until the cell eventually stops replicating and dies. When scientists figured this out in the 1980s, it created a splash as a potential explanation -- and cure -- for the whole catastrophe of the aging process.\n\nTurns out it's more complicated than that. Of course! But the \"anti-aging\" industry has generated plenty of enticing offers to measure your telomeres and add to their length -- and add to your years on the planet. For a price.\n\nMeanwhile, back in serious academia, scientists went on grappling with the significance of telomeres -- and telomerase, the enzyme process that rebuilds them. But then, says Dana A. Glei, a senior research investigator at Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Population and Health, they started hearing from people in the outside world, eager to have their telomeres tested.\n\n\"One day my colleague sent me this story about 'the test that can predict death with a terrifying degree of accuracy,'\" Glei says. \"It turned out the entire article is based on a study of birds. It made me start to really think. I know from the literature that the evidence is mixed on the association between telomere length and mortality. Some studies find it, and some studies don\u2019t.\"\n\nSo Glei and colleagues at Georgetown, Princeton, Stanford, Berkeley, the University of Washington and the Universidad de Costa Rica asked a dazzlingly simple research question: How does telomere length stack up against other indicators as a predictor of death?\n\nTo answer it, they collected data from Taiwan, Costa Rica and the United States, where more than 4,000 people completed an exam that included results on the average length of telomeres in their white blood cells. Out of 22 variables, the researchers reported in the journal PLOS One, by far the best predictor of five-year mortality turned out to be the obvious one: chronological age.\n\nOther self-reported factors, from mobility to smoking habits, were also pretty reliable, they found. And three biomarkers measured in these patients did fairly well. But telomere length was not one of them; in fact, its ability to predict death was just slightly better than a \"coin toss.\"\n\nThe lesson, Glei says, is that your own perceptions of your well-being can still beat the best available lab test for telomeres.\n\n\"There\u2019s a message getting out there that\u2019s not consistent with the science,\" she warns. \"Telomeres are cool and it\u2019s very interesting, but don\u2019t waste your money.\"\n\nAs for the research implications of this paper, Glei says it has challenged her colleagues to consider the expense of sophisticated biomarker testing in large-scale health surveys.\n\n\"We need to step back and think about whether it\u2019s worth it,\" she says. \"It's not only costly; it\u2019s invasive. It\u2019s a lot easier to ask respondents whether they can climb stairs than to take their blood.\"\n\nFollow Barbara Peters Smith on Twitter @BarbaraPSmith.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "The lesson, Glei says, is that your own perceptions of your well-being can still beat the best available lab test for telomeres.\nBut telomere length was not one of them; in fact, its ability to predict death was just slightly better than a \"coin toss.\"\nI know from the literature that the evidence is mixed on the association between telomere length and mortality.\n\"One day my colleague sent me this story about 'the test that can predict death with a terrifying degree of accuracy,'\" Glei says.\nOut of 22 variables, the researchers reported in the journal PLOS One, by far the best predictor of five-year mortality turned out to be the obvious one: chronological age."}
