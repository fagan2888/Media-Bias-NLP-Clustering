Multi-camera comedy. Live audience. A young couple, Jerrod Carmichael, played by Jerrod Carmichael, and his newly cohabiting girlfriend, Maxine (Amber Stevens). His wackily dramatic parents, played by David Alan Grier and Loretta Devine. His even wackier brother Bobby (Lil Rel Howery) and Bobby's very present ex-wife, Nekeisha (Tiffany Haddish). They drive each other crazy! And they love each other too.\n\nIf you know Carmichael's solo work \u2014 captured in his Spike Lee-directed HBO special last year, \"Love at the Store\" \u2014 you would expect something more from him than a mere family comedy, and you get it. (Some lines have been lifted straight from that routine \u2014 bits about how you can judge a neighborhood by the quality of the litter or being thrown to the ground by the police because he \"fit a description.\")\n\nAlthough the series is not as philosophically unsettling or politically unpredictable as his stage comedy, which gambols in the depths of human self-deception, it is unusually topical and thematically pointed for a people-on-a-couch comedy in the year 2015: The second episode begins with Bobby entering stage left to announce that the police have shot an unarmed teenager. (Carmichael has cited Norman Lear as an influence on \"The Carmichael Show,\" and like a Lear show, this one can get loud.)\n\nThe star is as good as he needs to be, given the excellent company. Smartly, the heavy lifting has been turned over to the seasoned professionals: Carmichael may be the man in the middle, but for much of the time this might as well be called \"The Devine and Grier Show.\" They are unfailingly funny, whatever they are asked to say.\n\nAdmittedly, it's hard for me to be impartial about anything involving Devine, whom I will turn up for anywhere. Lines a lesser player would make outrageous, with a capital O and an exclamation point at the end, she makes human and delightful and musical. She's a flute with the body of a French horn.\n\n------------\n\n'The Carmichael Show'\n\nWhere: NBC\n\nWhen: 9 and 9:30 p.m. Wednesday\n\nRating: TV-PG-D (may be unsuitable for young children, with an advisory for suggestive dialogue)", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "'The Carmichael Show' balances pointed topicality with humor", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Jerrod Carmichael, a highly talented, laconically provocative, relatively young stand-up comic, has a sitcom debuting Wednesday on NBC, \"The Carmichael Show.\" And he doesn't even have a Wikipedia page yet.", "title": "'The Carmichael Show' balances pointed topicality with humor", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/la-et-st-carmichael-review-20150826-column.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55dcff5d/turbine/la-et-st-carmichael-review-20150826", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Jerrod Carmichael, The Carmichael Show, NBC, sitcoms, David Alan Grier, Loretta Devine, Amber Stevens, Lil Rel Howery, Tiffany Haddish, Nicholas Stoller, Spike Lee, Love at the Store, television, review, Robert Lloyd", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/84286854", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-08-25", "Description": "On NBC's \"The Carmichael Show,\" Jerrod Carmichael stays topical but knows how to laugh.
