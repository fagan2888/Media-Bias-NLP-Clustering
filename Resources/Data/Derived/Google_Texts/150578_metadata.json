Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina) introduced Senate Bill 151 on Thursday, saying the new legislation would increase protection for kids under 18 as well.\n\n\u201cIt is much easier for someone who is 17 to get cigarettes from a friend who is 18,\u201d he said. \u201cSomeone who is 21 is more likely to be in the workforce or in college, and unlikely to have a younger set of friends.\u201d\n\nStudies show that 90 percent of current smokers tried their first cigarette before turning 18. About 95 percent tried smoking before age 21.\n\n\u201cThe ages between 18 to 21 are such a critical period because that\u2019s when a lot of smokers move from that experimental smoking period to being regular, daily smokers,\u201d said Lindsey Freitas, senior director at the American Lung Association in California.\n\nIf passed, California would be the first state in the country to raise the minimum smoking age to 21. New York City and Healdsburg (Sonoma County) have done so on the municipal level.\n\nSeveral states rejected similar proposals last year, including Utah, Maryland and Colorado.\n\nRep. Daniel Kagan opposed a bill in Colorado, saying 18-year-olds are adults who should be persuaded not to smoke, not banned from smoking.\n\n\u201cDo we tell them, you may not do this, we\u2019re going to stop them? Or do we urge them to take responsibility for their actions and treat them like adults?\u201d the Democrat said at the time. \u201cI come down on the side of treating 18-to-20-year-olds like adults.\u201d\n\nAltria Group Inc, an umbrella company that includes tobacco brands like Philip Morris, Marlboro, Parliament and Virginia Slims, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company has opposed past state efforts to raise the minimum smoking age beyond 18, and urged waiting until the results become available from a study by the Food and Drug Administration on the public health implications of raising the smoking age. The findings are due to Congress this year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Passage of bill would make state first in the country to adopt this kind of approach.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"California Considers Raising Smoking Age to 21\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/01\\/29\\/california-considers-raising-smoking-age-to-21\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-01-29 17:34:23\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-01-30 05:38:24\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":23702,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Tobacco\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2012\\/05\\/NoSmokingSign_DaveWhelan_Flickr_05072012.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Passage of bill would make state first in the country to adopt this kind of approach.", "title": "California Considers Raising Smoking Age to 21", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/01/29/california-considers-raising-smoking-age-to-21/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2012/05/NoSmokingSign_DaveWhelan_Flickr_05072012-620x443.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "tobacco", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe071a\"", "article_summary": "If passed, California would be the first state in the country to raise the minimum smoking age to 21.\nAbout 95 percent tried smoking before age 21.\nState lawmakers want to raise the legal smoking age in California from 18 to 21, arguing the change would reduce smoking rates overall and lower health care costs associated with tobacco use.\nThe company has opposed past state efforts to raise the minimum smoking age beyond 18, and urged waiting until the results become available from a study by the Food and Drug Administration on the public health implications of raising the smoking age.\n\u201cIt is much easier for someone who is 17 to get cigarettes from a friend who is 18,\u201d he said."}
