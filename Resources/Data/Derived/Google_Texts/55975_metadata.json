It\u2019s not the ideal fit for Striedl, who graduated from Illinois State University in 2013 with a bachelor\u2019s degree in communication education. But, it\u2019s better than bouncing from building to building as she did last year.\n\n\u201cThis is a nice way to get to know the teachers, the staff, the students,\u201d Striedl said. \u201cThis way I\u2019m not an unfamiliar face.\u201d\n\nThe situation also benefits DeKalb School District 428, which has had problems finding substitute teachers to fill some of the 5,600 daily teacher absences it experiences throughout the year. Data from the district show it uses 47 substitutes a day.\n\nDistrict leaders recently approved a program that places 11 substitutes at specific schools. Meanwhile, other districts are trying other methods to cut down on how often they count on a shrinking pool of backup teachers.\n\nHaving substitute teachers who show up to one building every day isn\u2019t unheard of, Human Resources Director Jim Bormann said, but it\u2019s not universal. He was inspired to create the program after scanning the district\u2019s teacher absences and ability to fill them. In cases where the district can\u2019t find a substitute, other teachers or administrators have to fill the gap.\n\n\u201cI tried to see if there were any days when subs were not needed,\u201d Bormann said. \u201cThe answer was no.\u201d\n\nDistrict 428\u2019s permanent substitutes earn $95 a day for the 168-day school year, a meager $15,960 annually. They don\u2019t receive benefits because it\u2019s technically not a full-time job as laid out by the Affordable Care Act. The position does have some perks, however.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re consistently a sub in the same building and you do a good job, you can bet you\u2019re on our list to hire,\u201d Bormann said.\n\nGenoa-Kingston School District 424 also uses substitutes everyday, who are paid $85 a day, Superintendent Joe Burgess said. Many of them are regulars, which he said cuts down on students trying to waste the day.\n\nThe district has also tried to decrease the numbers of substitutes it uses by shortening the school day Wednesday to give teachers time to meet. Before last year, teachers would have to find subs once a month so they could meet and review data.", "article_metadata": {"copyright": "2016 Daily Chronicle", "og": {"url": "http://www.daily-chronicle.com/2014/11/06/dekalb-county-school-districts-coping-with-substitute-shortage/aextl27/", "image": "http://www.daily-chronicle.com/_internal/cimg!0/59ed93ay47p7hfwp6udi3mmm7t8681f", "site_name": "Daily Chronicle", "description": "DeKALB \u2013 As a permanent substitute teacher, the only thing consistent about Raechel Striedl\u2019s days is that she spends them at DeKalb High School.", "title": "DeKalb County school districts coping with substitute shortage"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.daily-chronicle.com/_internal/cimg!0/59ed93ay47p7hfwp6udi3mmm7t8681f", "description": "DeKALB \u2013 As a permanent substitute teacher, the only thing consistent about Raechel Striedl\u2019s days is that she spends them at DeKalb High School.", "site": "@daily_chronicle", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "DeKalb County school districts coping with substitute shortage"}, "robots": "All", "revisit-after": "1 Days", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1109104291", "tout": {"article": {"id": "c4ca7c85-416b-4d2a-bfa8-0450a1d4cade"}}, "keywords": "#schools", "distribution": "Global", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde35\"", "article_summary": "DeKALB \u2013 As a permanent substitute teacher, the only thing consistent about Raechel Striedl\u2019s days is that she spends them at DeKalb High School.\nGenoa-Kingston School District 424 also uses substitutes everyday, who are paid $85 a day, Superintendent Joe Burgess said.\n\u201cThis way I\u2019m not an unfamiliar face.\u201dThe situation also benefits DeKalb School District 428, which has had problems finding substitute teachers to fill some of the 5,600 daily teacher absences it experiences throughout the year.\nHaving substitute teachers who show up to one building every day isn\u2019t unheard of, Human Resources Director Jim Bormann said, but it\u2019s not universal.\nThe district has also tried to decrease the numbers of substitutes it uses by shortening the school day Wednesday to give teachers time to meet."}
