What would you do with your life if you could start over? That is what a local author is asking in her new book.

Barbara Nethery held a special dedication event Friday evening in Panama City Beach for her book "The Process."

Nethery says her book will take readers through a journey with great compassion.

She says the end of the adventure will lead to a renewed self and healthier relationships.

"There are some exercises in the book and the exercises will help open up your mind so you can see things that you normally wouldn't see in your life," explained Nethery. "Sometimes all you need to do is to see something and it loses its power over you."

Nethery autographed copies of her book at the dedication, you can purchase copies of "The Process" at Barbara'sWorkshop's.com, Amazon, at Books-a-Million, or Barnes and Noble.
