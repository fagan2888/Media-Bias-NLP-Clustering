Joseph Crowley to tout his state's health care reform success. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images File Photo)\n\nIn 2014, Steve Beshear sat in the first lady\u2019s box during the State of the Union as President Barack Obama applauded the Democratic governor\u2019s work on health care in Kentucky. Just two years later, Beshear is out of office and feuding with his Republican successor, who vowed to undo his work.\n\n\"And if you want to know the real impact this law is having, just talk to Gov. Steve Beshear of Kentucky, who's here tonight,\" said Obama, referencing the Affordable Care Act. \"Kentucky's not the most liberal part of the country. That's not where I got my highest vote totals. But he is like a man possessed when it comes to covering his commonwealth's families.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0rJbRGPUkA\n\n\u201cOur efforts in health care have been second to none in the country,\u201d Beshear told Roll Call in a recent interview. The recently former governor proudly relayed how the rate of uninsured people in Kentucky fell from 20 percent to 9 percent.\n\nWhile Beshear\u2019s legacy will undoubtedly include Kynect, the state\u2019s insurance exchange, and Medicaid expansion, there is considerable tension in the Bluegrass State. Matt Bevin was not only elected governor in November to succeed Beshear, but he defeated the state\u2019s sitting attorney general with the largest margin of victory for a Republican in a Kentucky gubernatorial contest since the Civil War. And Bevin made repealing Beshear\u2019s health care decisions a linchpin of his campaign.\n\n\u201cHe says the current system is unsustainable but he doesn\u2019t have the facts to back it up,\u201d Beshear said of Bevin\u2019s plans . \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see what steps are really attempted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing to stop any rollback are the people themselves,\u201d the former governor said, counting on close to 500,000 people who received health care coverage for the first time to oppose Bevin.\n\nEven though it got the most national attention, Beshear\u2019s time in office was about more than health care.\n\n\u201cFrom my vantage point, we brought Kentucky through the worse recession of our lifetimes. We\u2019re really on the move here,\u201d reflected Beshear, who cited an unemployment rate that decreased from 11 percent to 4.9 percent but mentioned more work needing to be done in Eastern Kentucky with the decline of the coal industry. But Beshear deferred to Kentuckians on his legacy.\n\n\u201cThe people of the state define a governor\u2019s legacy more than he does himself,\u201d he said.\n\nBeshear reflected on his eight years in office to Roll Call just a few hours after seeing his son Andy sworn in as Kentucky\u2019s state attorney general.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s intelligent and talented and has the right temperament for the job,\u201d said Beshear, who would know what the job entails since he held the job from 1979 to 1983, when Andy was a toddler.\n\nAndy was one of the only Democratic survivors last November in an election that saw Republicans take over the governorship, state treasurer\u2019s office, and defeat state Auditor Adam Edelen. Democrats hoped Edelen would use a re-election victory as a springboard to take on GOP Sen. Rand Paul in 2016.\n\nDemocrats are also trying to keep control of the state House, which Republicans haven\u2019t controlled since 1921. It is the last state legislative body in the South still held by Democrats. Their task is being made more difficult by Bevin\u2019s penchant for appointing Democratic legislators to state positions, creating vulnerable open seats.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 preferred that Steve Beshear would take on Paul this year, but the 71-year-old says he is done running for office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll come up with a substantive Democrat,\u201d said Beshear with the Jan. 26 filing deadline quickly approaching. Lexington Mayor Jim Gray and retired Marine Corps Reserve officer Andrew Horne are considering bids, but the former governor believes Democratic recruiting efforts are hampered, not just against recent heavy losses in the state, but the reputation of Washington, where \u201cno one can agree on the time of day.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople look at Washington and are disgusted,\u201d according to Beshear. \u201cMost people are not left or Right. They are common-sense type of people. They just want government to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot many people want those jobs anymore,\u201d Beshear explained about recruiting for federal offices. \u201cEvery former governor I\u2019ve talked to in the Senate isn\u2019t the happiest of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cA governor can make things happen,\u201d he continued. \u201cAs a senator, all you do is raise money, travel back and forth, and give speeches.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that Beshear never tried to come to Washington to see for himself, considering he challenged GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell in 1996.\n\n\u201cHe is a ruthless campaigner,\u201d recalled Beshear, who said he learned to become a better fundraiser as a result of his 56-43 percent loss. \u201cYou better be as well-funded as possible because the other party will define themselves, but they will also define you.\u201d\n\nThe two-term governor has survived the partisan political wars and had some nonpartisan advice for his successor.\n\n\u201cRunning a government is much different than running a campaign,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cThere are no easy answers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurround yourself with very good people. That\u2019s step one,\u201d he continued \u201cStep two is listen to them.\u201d\n\nContact Gonzales at nathangonzales@rollcall.com and follow him on Twitter at @nathanlgonzales.\n\nRelated:\n\nRoll Call Race Ratings Map: Ratings for Every House and Senate Race in 2016 Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In 2014, Steve Beshear sat in the first lady\u2019s box during the State of the Union as President Barack Obama applauded the Democratic governor\u2019s work on health care in Kentucky.
