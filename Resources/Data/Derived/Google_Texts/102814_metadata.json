In doing so we must contemplate the Affordable Care Act, the wars that he promised to end but really didn\u2019t, the growth of the national debt and domestic spying by the federal government.\n\nBut here\u2019s one more topic based on a number: 45.8 million.\n\nThat is how many Americans were on food stamps at the end of the fiscal year 2015, which concluded last Sept. 30.\n\nWe\u2019re told that unemployment is going down. In fact, the national and state rates are about half of what they were at the height of the recession. We\u2019re told that the economy is improving. But do Americans believe their prospects are getting better? Our presidential candidates all seem to say no.\n\nAccording to federal data, about 28 million Americans received government assistance to buy food when Obama took office. As the recession deepened that number exploded. By 2010 it was 40 million \u2014 and has never dipped below that level since \u2014 and peaked at 47.6 million in 2013. The good news is that almost 2 million fewer people received food-buying assistance last year than in 2013.\n\nTo give community leaders around the state a taste of what that\u2019s like the University of Florida\u2019s holds \u201cFrom Poverty to Promise\u201d programs. It is designed to teach the better off what it\u2019s like to be worse off, with limited financial resources, no job or a menial one, and a family facing multiple challenges, if not outright crises, including teen pregnancies and jailed relatives.\n\nWhat they typically learn, according to a report on a recent \u201cFrom Poverty to Promise\u201d presentation in Polk County, is that frustration, anxiety and hopelessness rule plenty of people\u2019s lives \u2014 every day.\n\nEnsuring there was enough food on the table was part of the program, as were paying expenses for medical and transportation needs. We referenced food stamps earlier because that is a direct barometer of how healthy the economy is. Eating tops the list of priorities, and when people cannot do it out of their own pockets, they seek help.\n\nMany critics want to think food stamps are a sham, that many recipients don\u2019t need them or that the system is rife with fraud. In 2013 the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank that explores how federal and state policies affect the poor, noted that the government found a fraud rate, in the form of overpayments or misdirected benefits, of less than 3 percent. And The Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthcare policy research group, notes that in Florida the average recipient reaps $129 a month in food stamps, about $4 above the national average.\n\nIt is worth noting that one in five Marion County households live below the federal poverty line, including 30 percent of its children. As the United Way\u2019s ALICE report showed last year, 4 in 10 Marion households do not earn enough to meet basic monthly expenses.\n\nCharity and government aid can help people in such situations. But to improve the conditions of the poor and the increasingly fragile middle class we need policies that revive the economy. And so it is important to listen to what the remaining presidential hopefuls are saying about how they\u2019ll boost the economy \u2014 and they need to say more, because growth and jobs fosters everything else.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As President Obama\u2019s term in office nears an end, more and more Americans are talking about what his legacy will be.
