Fire up that grill and start flipping those beef patties, Americans! Your annual Fourth of July cookout will cost you about three percent less compared to one year ago, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation. The average cost for one cookout guest is less than six dollars. A crucial reason for the decline is the lower fuel and energy prices this year compared to last year. Lower energy prices keep the costs of the processed foods in your shopping cart down.

In preparation for the number one grilling holiday of the year, 190 million pounds of beef is purchased two weeks before the big day; 700 million pounds of chicken is bought one week prior; and 150 million hot dogs are consumed the day of the feast. According to an Instantly poll, Americans’ top three favorite side dishes to go along with their grilled fare are baked beans (51 percent), corn on the cob (60 percent), and potato salad (61 percent).

July 4th isn’t just a holiday about food; it’s also the top selling beer holiday in the U.S. Each year the two weeks surrounding Independence Day rank the highest for two-week beer sales in America.
