Other switches included the decision to delay the employer insurance mandate for a year, something many lawmakers said should have required a congressional vote.\n\nObama changed the law to allow insurance companies to allow canceled plans after coming under criticism when millions of people found out their plans were no longer being offered despite Obama's repeated promise that under ObamaCare, people would be able to keep their insurance plans if they liked them.\n\nThe change, the Republican attorney generals argue, exceeds precedents set by Supreme Court decisions.\n\nThe officials point to the 1985 Heckler v. Chaney case, in which the Supreme Court concluded that some enforcement actions of laws might be subject to judicial review first.\n\nSecurity on the state and federal health insurance exchanges is another major issue the Republicans say they want the Obama administration to improve.\n\nHHS continues to \u201cignore the widespread public outcry over the security of consumers\u2019 private information\u201d on exchanges,\u201d they wrote, adding that they\u2019re concerned about the administration\u2019s decision to \u201cnot propose and implement rigorous privacy standards for outreach personnel.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\u201cThe illegal actions by this administration must stop,\" the attorneys general wrote.", "description": "\u201cThe illegal actions by this administration must stop,\" the attorneys general wrote.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Rebecca Shabad", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\u201cThe illegal actions by this administration must stop,\" the attorneys general wrote.", "title": "Eleven attorneys general slam Obama healthcare fixes as illegal", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/194265-11-gop-attorneys-general-accuse-obama-of-using", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/obamabarack_103013getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T12:18:14-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/194265-11-gop-attorneys-general-accuse-obama-of-using", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\u201cThe illegal actions by this administration must stop,\" the attorneys general wrote.", "card": "summary", "title": "Eleven attorneys general slam Obama healthcare fixes as illegal"}, "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T12:18-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/194265-11-gop-attorneys-general-accuse-obama-of-using", "dcterms.date": "2014-01-02T12:54-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Rebecca Shabad", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Kathleen Sebelius,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-02T12:54:45-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T12:18:14-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "Eleven attorneys general slam Obama healthcare fixes as illegal"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd84e9\"", "article_summary": "Eleven GOP attorneys general say the Obama administration is breaking the law by repeatedly making changes to ObamaCare without going through Congress.\nThe attorneys general specifically criticize President Obama's executive action that allowed insurance companies to keep offering health plans that had been canceled for not meeting ObamaCare's more rigorous standards.\nSecurity on the state and federal health insurance exchanges is another major issue the Republicans say they want the Obama administration to improve.\nADVERTISEMENTThey say the healthcare fix was \u201cflatly illegal under federal constitutional and statutory law.\u201dHHS did not respond to a request for comment.\n\u201cWe support allowing citizens to keep their health insurance coverage, but the only way to fix this problem-ridden law is to enact changes lawfully: through Congressional action,\u201d the attorneys general wrote in a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary."}
