Like Abraham Lincoln, we rely on the Declaration of Independence for our authority to assert that every individual human being has a Creator-endowed right to life, and that it is the duty of government to protect that right.\n\nCool.\n\nBesides the obvious \u201cmy body, my choice\u201d liberal perspective on this, which says that what a woman decides to do with what\u2019s in her body is up to her, there\u2019s a massive problem with the Republicans\u2019 pro-life platform.\n\nRepublicans are so dedicated to making sure that every single goddamn baby is born into beautiful America and its spacious skies, amber waves of grain, and purple mountain majesties above the fruited plains.\n\nBut why don\u2019t they give a single sh*t about that baby once it\u2019s actually born?\n\nRepublicans are against federally-funded maternity leave, a program that would allow a woman to actually take care of her baby.\n\nIn an interview on CNN this past Sunday, Republican nominee Carly Fiorina said she doesn\u2019t oppose paid maternity leave in and of itself, but she opposes the federal government mandating paid maternity leave for private businesses.\n\nOther Republicans hold a similar viewpoint, claiming that the decision to mandate maternity leave should be left to the private sector and not the federal government.\n\nBusinesses know what they\u2019re doing, Republicans argue, and will make maternity leave decisions as they see fit.\n\nWell, that isn\u2019t what actually happens. Having federally-mandated, paid maternity leave is in fact vital. As Jennifer Senior writes in The New York Times, unless the government actually mandates paid maternity leave, businesses simply don\u2019t feel obligated to offer it:\n\nWithout government assistance \u2014 or nudging \u2014 most businesses will never feel the obligation to pay for family leave on their own. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 11 percent of private-sector workers got paid family leave in 2012. As Mr. Obama noted this summer, \u201cmany women can't even get a paid day off to give birth.\u201d\n\nHow the hell can Republicans force a woman to give birth to a child while also refusing to give her the time and resources to take care of that child?\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute reports that 75 percent of women who have had abortions had them because a baby would have interfered with their work.\n\nWith access to federally-mandated, paid maternity leave, those women might not have had abortions in the first place. They could have been confident that having a child wouldn\u2019t negatively impact their jobs.\n\nBut Republicans don\u2019t want to promise working women that they\u2019ll be able to take care of their children after they\u2019re born. They just want to get those babies out of those vaginas.\n\nRepublicans are against federally-funded programs for low-income families, and almost half of all abortions are performed on low-income women.\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute report notes that 75 percent of women who have had abortions did so because having a baby would have been too much of a financial burden.\n\nForty-two percent of women who get abortions have incomes \u201cbelow 100 percent\u201d of the federal poverty level (which is $10,830 a year for a single woman with no children), and 27 percent have incomes \u201cbetween 100\u2013199%\u201d of the federal poverty level.\n\nAnd yet Republicans still want to cut crucial federal programs that give crucial aid to low-income families.\n\nIn May, the New York Times reported that House Republicans proposed deep cuts in the federal budget for food stamps and welfare \u2014 as well as a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIf these programs remained in place, low-income women wouldn\u2019t need abortions. They would be confident in their financial ability to raise a child.\n\nBut Republicans still can\u2019t make that promise. All babies must be born, regardless of whether or not their mothers can provide them with food, shelter and health care.\n\nIt\u2019s hypocritical of Republicans to be pro-life and not provide women with the basic tools they need to take care of their children.\n\nWomen aren\u2019t having abortions because they\u2019re \u201cirresponsible.\u201d They\u2019re having abortions to be responsible.\n\nFor one, a woman\u2019s body is hers. She should be able to do what she wants with it. If she wants to get an abortion, she should be able to get an abortion.\n\nBut some women simply don\u2019t have the resources to take care of a baby.\n\nThey\u2019re at the hand of Republican-backed policies that literally prevent women from obtaining the resources necessary to live and provide. So can Republicans really say they care all that much about fetuses?\n\nNo. Absolutely not.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans want you to have kids, not take care of them.", "og": {"site_name": "Elite Daily", "description": "Republicans want you to have kids, not take care of them.", "title": "Republicans Stop Giving A Sh*t About Babies Once They're Actually Born", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2015-08-19T08:56:20+00:00", "url": "http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/republicans-stop-giving-sht-babies-theyre-actually-born/1176592/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Elite Daily", "description": "Republicans want you to have kids, not take care of them.", "creator": "@alexialafata", "title": "Republicans Stop Giving A Sh*t About Babies Once They\u2019re Actually Born", "site": "@EliteDaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/republicans-stop-giving-sht-babies-theyre-actually-born/1176592/"}, "ios": {"url": "http://elitedaily.com/news/politics/republicans-stop-giving-sht-babies-theyre-actually-born/1176592/", "app_store_id": 1032458504, "app_name": "Elite Daily"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 378366428966386}, "keywords": "republicans,", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/EliteDaily", "published_time": "2015-08-12T15:59:29+00:00", "author": "alexialafata", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-08-19T08:56:20+00:00", "tag": "abortion,CNN,debate,Liberal,Republican Debate,republicans"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.elitestatic.com/content/themes/strangelove/images/apple_favicon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "republicans,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf76c\"", "article_summary": "Women aren\u2019t having abortions because they\u2019re \u201cirresponsible.\u201d They\u2019re having abortions to be responsible.\nRepublicans are against federally-funded maternity leave, a program that would allow a woman to actually take care of her baby.\nBusinesses know what they\u2019re doing, Republicans argue, and will make maternity leave decisions as they see fit.\nIn an interview on CNN this past Sunday, Republican nominee Carly Fiorina said she doesn\u2019t oppose paid maternity leave in and of itself, but she opposes the federal government mandating paid maternity leave for private businesses.\nWith access to federally-mandated, paid maternity leave, those women might not have had abortions in the first place."}
