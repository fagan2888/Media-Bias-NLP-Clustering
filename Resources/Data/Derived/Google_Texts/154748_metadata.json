They were randomly assigned to a control group with no financial incentive to lose weight, or to one of three programs each offering a weight-loss incentive valued at $550.\n\nTwo of the programs offered health insurance premium reductions, and the third featured participation in a daily lottery.\n\nAfter 12 months, no significant changes in average weight loss were observed among any of the four groups, according to the study published in the January issue of the journal Health Affairs.\n\n\"More than 80 percent of large employers use financial incentives for health promotion,\" Dr. Mitesh Patel, an assistant professor of medicine and health care management, said in the news release. \"Many use health insurance premium adjustments, but these incentives are often delayed and, even when they aren't, they are typically hidden in paychecks along with other deductions and payments.\"\n\nPatel and his colleagues said the findings suggest that employers should consider testing alternatives to the $550 premium-based incentives used in this study.\n\nVolpp added that \"in this case, premium adjustments had little impact on weight, and the lottery incentives we used were constrained by having to do weigh-ins in workplace settings. That made sustained engagement and behavior change more challenging.\"\n\nThough study participants didn't experience significant weight loss, that doesn't mean that all incentive programs are ineffective, the researchers said.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, often called \"Obamacare,\" companies can use up to 30 percent of health insurance premiums -- about $1,800 for the average worker -- to encourage employees to adopt healthy lifestyles.\n\nMore information\n\nThe American Academy of Family Physicians has more about healthy living.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 HealthDay.
