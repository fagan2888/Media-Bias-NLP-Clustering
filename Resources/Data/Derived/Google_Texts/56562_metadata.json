Cintron\n\nThree longtime incumbent Congressmen representing this community are facing challengers in the March 15 primary.\n\n1ST DISTRICT (D)\n\nHoward B. Brookins Jr. was elected alderman of the 21st Ward in 2003 and has held that position ever since. In City Council, he currently chairs the Committee on Economic, Capital, and Technology Development and is past chair of the Chicago City Council Black Caucus. Brookins would like to move up to Congress and feels that one of the big challenges the area faces is economic development.\n\n\u201cUnemployment leads to a lot of the social problems and crimes we see happening in the district,\u201d Brookins said. \u201cBy bringing jobs and investments into the district, we can help improve the quality of life in these vulnerable communities.\u201d If elected to Congress, Brookins intends to focus on criminal justice reform, education, and infrastructure.\n\n\u201cFrom my experience as a public defender and criminal defense lawyer, there should be more accountability from the government and police departments,\u201d Brookins said. He noted that, as a married father of two boys, he cares deeply about public education and will seek opportunities to improve community schools.\n\nAlso, \u201cOur roads and bridges are crumbling,\u201d Brookins said. \u201cI will champion infrastructure projects that make our neighborhoods stronger.\u201d He graduated from Northern Illinois Law School in 1988 and has served as a public defender and assistant state\u2019s attorney under State\u2019s Attorney Cecil Partee. Brookins also has maintained his private law practice since 1991. He was born and raised in the Auburn Gresham area and now represents it in the City Council. See www.brookinsforcongress.com.\n\nPatrick Brutus has served for the past nine years as Coordinator of Economic Development for the City of Chicago in the Department of Planning and Development. He has held positions in the divisions of Neighborhood Development, Housing Preservation/Neighbor-hood Stabilization, Workforce Development, and Business Development.\n\nHaving worked in Will County, the south suburbs, and the South Side of Chicago, Brutus said he understands \u201cthe complex challenges residents of the 1st District face from crime and safety; planning for quality affordable housing; and creating smart and reasonable economic development projects that create jobs.\u201d He promises to bring a regional approach to his work in Congress and to represent all areas of the district equally.\n\n\u201cI will also fight for responsible gun control, human rights, and equal protection for all, and sensible regional planning which includes lower property taxes and real healthcare for the uninsured in our district,\u201d Brutus said.\n\n\u201cI will hold hearings to discover how we can set our country on a path to accomplishing the goal of returning America to a kinder, peaceful, and gentler nation,\u201d Brutus said.\n\nBrutus noted he has a particular interest in \u201clivable communities,\u201d which he said he \u201cenjoyed as a youth and ultimately made an integral career focus. He grew up in University Park, IL and graduated from Hickory Elementary/Deer Creek Junior High and Crete-Monee High School. He completed his graduate studies at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He and his wife have been married 11 years and have three children.\n\nBrutus is \u201ccommitted to ensuring that all families have fair and equal opportunities for prosperity.\u201d See www.brutusforcongress.com.\n\nIncumbent Congressman Bobby Rush, who has served since 1993, is extremely proud of his work to pass the Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare\u201d). While Rush noted it cost Democrats control of the House of Representatives in 2010, he also said it \u201cresulted in nearly 20 million more Americans having healthcare today.\u201d He also has worked for better healthcare in the district.\n\n\u201cSince the murder of my son Huey in 1999, I have fought to restore trauma level care to the South Side of Chicago and worked with local community activists and healthcare leaders on possible solutions,\u201d he said. Rush has worked with the University of Chicago Medical Center to provide adult trauma services at its Hyde Park campus, which the university agreed to in December.\n\nRush is the ranking Democrat on the House Subcommittee on Energy and Power. \u201cI plan to intensify my advocacy working with our nation\u2019s energy leaders to create a pipeline of next-generation energy entrepreneurs and employees.\u201d\n\nInfrastructure is another area Rush concentrates on. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with local, State, and Federal officials to improve the quality of our public infrastructure, ranging from the construction of the I-294/I-57 Interchange and the Metra Englewood flyover, the reconstruction of the Chicago Transit Authority\u2019s south Red Line, and the development of flood control plans for the south and southwest suburbs,\u201d he said.\n\nRush noted in his time in Congress he has gotten passed or assisted with legislation \u201cthat has improved our environment, strengthened consumer safety, especially for children, provided affordable and accessible healthcare, created jobs, and sustained businesses.\u201d See www.rush.house.gov.\n\n1ST DISTRICT (R)\n\nJimmy Lee Tillman II is an urban political strategist and hip hop political talk show host. As an independent Republican, he feels that what he calls \u201cthe increasing dissatisfaction among African Americans towards the Democratic Party\u201d will lead to \u201ca much needed change\u201d in Chicago\u2019s political make up.\n\n\u201cVoters in Cook County and Illinois are eager for an alternative to the current all-Democratic leadership that has delivered very little,\u201d Tillman remarked. \u201cIt is important that our community is represented in both political parties. African Americans need a voice in the Republican majority that will bring our issues to the floor of Congress.\u201d\n\nAs a resident of the largest African American district in the nation, Tillman feels that the time is now for the African American community to send a Republican representative to the Congress and for an advocate in the Republican Party to make certain that issues important to African Americans are addressed, including the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and to have a complete critique and evaluation of the effects the 1994 Clinton Crime Bill.\n\nLocally, Tillman said, he will advocate for Chicago to have a twoparty municipal election \u201cto end the one party rule that has caused disenfranchisement, disengagement, and distrust of the often complex election process.\u201d\n\nTillman is a father of three and an alumnus of Central State University. He is the son of Dr. Jimmy Lee Tillman I and former Alderman Dorothy Wright Tillman.

He noted his grandfather, Hugh O\u2019Neill, and father, August Deuser, were Chicago police officers, and that he was a police officer for three years before going back to school and becoming a teacher. Deuser believes Congress must clean up government spending.\n\n\u201cOur country is in great debt at both the State and Federal levels,\u201d Deuser said. \u201cIt is time to change the culture of politics,\u201d he added. \u201cOne way to change the culture of politics in our country is to vote many of the current politicians out of office. It is time to vote for people who want to change the way business is conducted.\u201d\n\nDeuser said, \u201cThere are many problems in this country that need change. We have police officers being shot, and we have children being shot. The greatest tragedy of all is children being shot in schools throughout the country. Part of it is due to the mental health problems of individuals. Part of it is due to the general lack of respect that permeates our society. People need to show each other respect. Children will learn what they are taught when raised by their families. People need to be responsible for their behavior. The door swings both ways, and we need to treat each other with respect.\n\n\u201cWe need to rid our society of gun violence. I believe the way to change this mentality toward violence is through education. Gun violence solves nothing and creates nothing,\u201d Deuser said. See www.deuser.us.\n\n4TH DISTRICT (D)\n\nLongtime Congressman Luis Gutierrez has held his seat since 1993. His more than 20 years of service have been highlighted by his advocacy for immigration reform and helping thousands of immigrants become citizens. He introduced a bill that would create a pathway to citizenship for non-criminal undocumented immigrants and championed the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Act, which helps eligible youths get a work permit and protection from deportation.\n\nGutierrez told the Gazette that he has also worked to \u201cdefend Planned Parenthood and a woman\u2019s right to choose, marriage equality and the end to discrimination of the LGBTQ community, and the Working Families Agenda that would raise the minimum wage and require equal pay for equal work and paid family, sick, and vacation leave.\u201d\n\nHe also introduced various initiatives aimed at holding Wall Street banks accountable by ending tax write-offs and reforming the criminal justice system and investing in violence prevention, rehabilitation, and community safety. If reelected, Gutierrez said he will continue to push for comprehensive immigration reform and gun control legislation. He would also continue efforts \u201chelping to provide the intelligence community the tools it needs to access encrypted communications without resorting to mass surveillance that most Americans reject, helping to reduce the backlog in the testing of rape kits so that rapists are punished and victims have access to justice, and to continue to protect the funding for the clean-up and development of the southern branch of the Chicago river for the environmental and recreational benefit of our community,\u201d Gutierrez said.

His political experience includes serving as a senior advisor to former Illinois Governor Pat Quinn. He also has worked with grassroots community organizations on pro-immigrant marches and lobbied for driver\u2019s licenses for undocumented immigrants in Illinois.\n\nAn immigrant who arrived from Mexico City in 1988, Salas said he understands the issues immigrants face but added he would \u201cnot just be a Congressman for Latinos; everyone has different problems.\u201d He added, \u201cI want to be a Congressman for everybody.\u201d Salas would work to improve the public education system and address unemployment by investing in education, new businesses, and infrastructure. As a national priority, Salas would support legislation that strengthens national security and improves the economy.\n\n\u201cI wanted to run for office because I see a lot of inaction in Washington, DC,\u201d Salas said, adding he feels Congress needs new energy and new voices. He would dedicate his service to the people in the district and not special interests.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no machine behind me or commitments to any politicians,\u201d he said.\n\nIf elected, Salas would prioritize getting young people interested in the political system and even limit his own terms of service to two cycles \u201cto pave the way for meaningful changes.\u201d For more information, go to www.javiersalasforcongress.info.\n\n7TH DISTRICT (D)\n\nIn office since 1997, Congressman Danny K. Davis said he is \u201cengaged in a whole plethora of things, championing a number of issues.\u201d He pointed to the Second Chance Act, his bill passed to provide transitional assistance to ex-offenders, which recently won reauthorization and funding for another two years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very engaged in fending off attacks on the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Davis added, pointing to the many Republican-led efforts to repeal the law known as Obamacare. He noted Obamacare holds particular significance in the 7th district, which has more hospitals than any other in the country. \u201cHealth care is a big part of the economy of our district,\u201d Davis explained. Davis often interacts with constituents in the many town hall meetings he holds. \u201cFor democracy to work, people must be engaged in it,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe seat does not belong to me. It\u2019s the people\u2019s seat.\u201d\n\nHe added that, while it is difficult to solve problems in Congress, his aim is to \u201clevel the playing field for low- and moderate-income people.\u201d He also plans to continue efforts to reform the criminal justice system, noting the United States has the most people incarcerated in the world, and to reduce recidivism. Education is another priority for Davis, who said investing in education is important to meet the demands of advancing technology.\n\nDavis serves on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee and is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. For more information, go to www.davis.house.gov.\n\nThomas Day is an Iraq war veteran and former journalist whose work has been published in national and international publications including the Washington Post. Day, along with two other Iraq war veterans, established The Bunker, a nonprofit business organization that supports veteran entrepreneurs and small-business owners in Chicago and four other\n\ncities.\n\nDay said one of the 7th District\u2019s biggest problems is unemployment, with a rate three times the national average. He explained that, while the city offers many jobs, employers have trouble finding qualified workers. For this reason, he supports manufacturing certification programs and national apprenticeship programs, which also will give ex-offenders the opportunity to participate in job training.\n\n\u201cWay too many ex-offenders are not being given the chance to reenter the workforce,\u201d Day said. If elected, he also would work to reform the criminal justice system, ensuring officials apply laws more evenly across all income brackets. He added the criminal justice system should be about rehabilitating, not just punishing, offenders.\n\nWhile he admits he lacks political experience, Day said his military and private sector background have taught him a great deal. \u201cI know how to support these organizations to create jobs for this district,\u201d he said, referring to organizations such as The Bunker. Day added that the military instilled in him the \u201ckind of ethics I want to introduce into the political system.\u201d For more information, go to www.thomasday.org.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "article_summary": "Day added that the military instilled in him the \u201ckind of ethics I want to introduce into the political system.\u201d For more information, go to www.thomasday.org.\nHe has held positions in the divisions of Neighborhood Development, Housing Preservation/Neighbor-hood Stabilization, Workforce Development, and Business Development.\nChallenger Javier Salas is a former radio and television host, having worked for Univision, Telefutura, and Telemundo, among other Chicago stations.\nDay said one of the 7th District\u2019s biggest problems is unemployment, with a rate three times the national average.\nPatrick Brutus has served for the past nine years as Coordinator of Economic Development for the City of Chicago in the Department of Planning and Development."}
