Zubik and the Diocese of Pittsburgh, according to the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty.\n\nThe biggest case was of course the Hobby Lobby ruling last June, which the Supreme Court cited in the Michigan case.\n\n\u201cThe government keeps making the same bad arguments and the Supreme Court keeps rejecting them \u2013 every single time. This is because the government can obviously come up with ways to distribute contraceptives without the forced involvement of Catholic ministries,\u201d Becket Fund senior counsel Mark Rienzi said in a statement.\n\n\u201cAs with the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Little Sisters of the Poor and Hobby Lobby, this is a strong signal that the Supreme Court will ultimately reject the government\u2019s narrow view of religious liberty,\u201d Rienzi added. \u201cAnd it makes it less likely that lower courts will accept arguments the Supreme Court has rejected over and over and over again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The Supreme Court on Monday dealt another blow to the Obamacare contraception mandate in what religious freedom advocates consider the latest in a string of victories.
