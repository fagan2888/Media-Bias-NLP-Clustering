But there was one notably absent voice: Donald Trump. But that did not mean the GOP frontrunner was expempt from fact-checkers.\n\nNBC News' partner Politifact took a look at how the candidates stacked up against their \"Truth-O-Meter\" scale.\n\nClaim One: Sen. Ted Cruz has never insulted Donald Trump\n\nKicking off the debate, Sen. Cruz said that he never \"insulted Donald personally.\"\n\nPolitiFact points out that defining a comment as an \"'insult' is somewhat in the eye of the beholder.\" But the recent shots fired between both candidates on the campaign trail makes Cruz's statement rank as \"Mostly False.\"\n\nNew tonight! Ted Cruz said he never insulted Donald Trump. Record suggests otherwise https://t.co/Nk42T4PJnx pic.twitter.com/i3uO4borP3 \u2014 PolitiFact (@PolitiFact) January 29, 2016\n\nClaim Two: Sen. Marco Rubio has not flipped on amnesty\n\nOnce again, Sen. Rubio was confronted about whether he flip-flopped on immigration after an unearthed clip showed him declaring his opposition to \"blanket amnesty\" in 2008.\n\nMegyn Kelly asked Rubio, \"Within two years of getting elected, you were co-sponsoring legislation to create a path to citizenship, in your words, amnesty. Haven't you already proven that you cannot be trusted on this issue?\"\n\nRubio responded by saying that he never supported blanket amnesty as a coauthor of the \"Gang of Eight\" bill. PolitiFact rates that statement as true since the legislation had \"significant hurdles including fines and a waiting period.\"\n\nBut did Rubio flip flop? Somewhat.\n\nNew tonight! Did Marco Rubio flip flop on amnesty? Half Flip. https://t.co/GsU2vo99W6 pic.twitter.com/kmdq1QzALH \u2014 PolitiFact (@PolitiFact) January 29, 2016\n\nClaim Three: Obamacare is the \"biggest job killer\"\n\nSen. Cruz did not go off script when criticizing Obamacare, arguing that the president's signature health care law remains \"the biggest job killer in this country.\"\n\nPolitiFact finds, \"By every measure, millions more people are working and millions fewer are stuck unwillingly in part-time work since the time the Affordable Care Act became law.\"\n\nCruz's claim gets the highest falsehood rating, \"Pants on Fire.\"\n\nPants on Fire!

Chris Christie blames neighbors for knowing about San Bernardino\n\nSan Bernardino stands as a real example of domestic terrorism, a troubling thought for Gov. Chris Christie, who blamed the attackers' neighbors for not reporting suspicious activity to police.\n\n\"These folks had weapons, they knew that they were talking about trying to take our country and attack it,\" Christie said. \"That's not profiling, that's law enforcement.\"\n\nPolitiFact rates the comment as flat out false. They found that there is \"no mention that a neighbor of the shooters themselves was suspicious, much less that a neighbor thought an attack was being planned.\"\n\nNew tonight! Chris Christie: Neighbors knew about San Bernardino attack, feared profiling. https://t.co/yRjx7iulqT pic.twitter.com/t39nrDA2pB \u2014 PolitiFact (@PolitiFact) January 29, 2016\n\nClaim Five: President Barack Obama \"degraded\" the U.S. military\n\nSen. Cruz blamed the administration's weak terrorism strategy on the president's decision to slash military spending.\n\n\"Barack Obama, right now, No.1, over seven years has dramatically degraded our military,\" he said.\n\nPolitiFact points out that while there is a small element of truth to Cruz's statement, Democrats and Republicans are to blame for the failed budget negotiations that could have increased spending.\n\nSince Congress is the only branch who can allocate a budget, PolitiFact rates the comment \"Mostly False.\"\n\nNEW: At debate, Cruz says Obama 'dramatically degraded our military' https://t.co/gsVuiq8Kj2 pic.twitter.com/5RrneB1Bgn \u2014 PolitiFact (@PolitiFact) January 29, 2016\n\nClaim Six: Donald Trump \"never once asked\" for Megyn Kelly's removal\n\nPrior to Trump's debate protest event for veterans, the billionaire told CNN that he \"never once asked\" Fox News to remove Megyn Kelly as a moderator. Instead, he blamed a scathing Fox News press release as the final straw.\n\nPolitiFact found three iterations of Trump saying that Kelly \"should not be allowed\" at the debate. His statement received a \"False\" rating.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NBC News' partner Politifact took a look at how the candidates stacked up against their \"Truth-O-Meter\" scale.", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "NBC News' partner Politifact took a look at how the candidates stacked up against their \"Truth-O-Meter\" scale.", "title": "Fact-Checking the Seventh Republican Debate", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/fact-checking-seventh-republican-debate-n507016", "image": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_04/1395011/iowa-debate-ejo-012816_987e8ee0ee8e96edef95b0392109db37.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "NBC News' partner Politifact took a look at how the candidates stacked up against their \"Truth-O-Meter\" scale.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2016_04/1395011/iowa-debate-ejo-012816_987e8ee0ee8e96edef95b0392109db37.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "Fact-Checking the Seventh Republican Debate - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2016-01-29", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/fact-checking-seventh-republican-debate-n507016", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Politics,2016 Election"}, "article_summary": "Claim One: Sen.
