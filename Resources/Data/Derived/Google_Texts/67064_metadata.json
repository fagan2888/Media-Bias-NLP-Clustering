However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering regulatory action against caffeine in pure powdered form, a teaspoon of which is equivalent to 25 cups of coffee.\n\nAdolescents are particularly drawn to the powerful stimulant, the FDA warned. A 500-gram bag of powdered caffeine may be purchased from Amazon and other online retailers for approximately $14.99 \u2014 raising the potential for increasing incidences of overdose. \u201cPure caffeine is a powerful stimulant and very small amounts may cause accidental overdose, the FDA said in a statement. \u201cAll consumers seeking caffeinated products should be aware of the potentially high potency of these powdered pure caffeine products.\"\n\nRegulators issued the warning after investigating the death in late May of 18-year-old Logan Steiner of LeGrange, Ohio, who had overdosed on powdered caffeine. Overdosing on caffeine may cause heartbeat disruptions, seizures, vomiting, diarrhea, and disorientation. \u201cThese symptoms are likely to be much more severe than those resulting from drinking too much coffee, tea, or other caffeinated beverages,\u201d the FDA said.\n\nFDA spokesperson Jennifer Dooren told ABC News that consumers who drink caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea, and soda may recognize milder effects of the drug, such as nervousness and tremors. However, many don\u2019t realize the potency of the pure form of the drug. \"The difference between a safe amount and a lethal dose of caffeine in these powdered products is very small,\" she said.\n\nThe FDA also said consumers may find it difficult, if not impossible, to accurately measure powdered pure caffeine with common kitchen measuring tools, heightening the danger of accidental overdose. Earlier this year, FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said regulators would investigate the safety of such caffeinated products as energy drinks and energy shots, following reports of illnesses and deaths from overdoses. Food manufacturers in recent years have even begun adding caffeine to such products as candy, nuts, and assorted snack foods.\n\nConsumer advocate Jim O'Hara of the Center for Science in the Public Interest lauded the FDA\u2019s warning, but recommended further action to restrict caffeine on the market. \u201cWhile that is a step forward, FDA should take whichever additional measures it can use against these products, and it has much more to do if it really wants to protect the public,\u201d he said in a statement. The consumer advocacy group had written to the FDA in June to request consumer warnings on caffeinated drinks. \u201cThe overuse and misuse of caffeine in the food supply is creating a wild-west marketplace, and it\u2019s about time the sheriff noticed and did something about it,\u201d O\u2019Hara said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "powdered caffeine, pure caffeine, pure powdered caffeine, powdered caffeine and teenagers, powdered caffeine and snorting, snorting caffeine", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Food and Drug Administration on Friday warned of the potential dangers of powdered caffeine, a teaspoon of which is equivalent to 25 cups of coffee.", "title": "Powdered Caffeine Can Kill: FDA", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-warns-powdered-caffeines-potentially-lethal-effects-after-accidental-overdose-death-teen-boy", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/19/adolescents-drawn-powdered-caffeine-fda-warns.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Food and Drug Administration on Friday warned of the potential dangers of powdered caffeine, a teaspoon of which is equivalent to 25 cups of coffee.", "title": "Powdered Caffeine Can Kill: FDA", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-warns-powdered-caffeines-potentially-lethal-effects-after-accidental-overdose-death-teen-boy", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/19/adolescents-drawn-powdered-caffeine-fda-warns.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/19/adolescents-drawn-powdered-caffeine-fda-warns.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-07-19T14:01:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-19T14:09:16-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Food and Drug Administration on Friday warned of the potential dangers of powdered caffeine, a teaspoon of which is equivalent to 25 cups of coffee."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2325\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAll consumers seeking caffeinated products should be aware of the potentially high potency of these powdered pure caffeine products.\"\n\u201cPure caffeine is a powerful stimulant and very small amounts may cause accidental overdose, the FDA said in a statement.\nRegulators issued the warning after investigating the death in late May of 18-year-old Logan Steiner of LeGrange, Ohio, who had overdosed on powdered caffeine.\nA 500-gram bag of powdered caffeine may be purchased from Amazon and other online retailers for approximately $14.99 \u2014 raising the potential for increasing incidences of overdose.\n\"The difference between a safe amount and a lethal dose of caffeine in these powdered products is very small,\" she said."}
