Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) urged women to \u2018get in the game\u2019 of politics and run for office during an appearance at Monmouth Reform Temple in Tinton Falls on Dec. 8.\n\nWasserman Schultz was greeted by more than 200 people for her talk on \u201cBeing a Jewish Woman on the American Political Stage.\u201d Her one-hour presentation included readings from her new book, For the Next Generation, A Wake-Up Call to Solving Our Nation\u2019s Problems.\n\n\u201cThis book is my way of sounding an alarm bell,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the times we are living in, I thought that through this book I could reach real people who are frustrated with the political process in Washington because they understand that we are frozen and polarized and if we don\u2019t deal with the big issues, the next generation will be in trouble.\n\n\u201cWe must do something that will dramatically move the ball,\u201d she said.\n\nThe event was organized with the help of the southern Jersey chapter of Organizing for Action, a successor to President Barack Obama\u2019s reelection campaign, and MRT\u2019s Rabbi Bob Ourach. The synagogue\u2019s Rabbi Emeritus Sally J. Priesand \u2014 the first woman to be ordained as a Reform rabbi in the United States \u2014 also attended.\n\nWasserman Schultz, whose 23rd district includes Broward and Miami-Dade counties, began her political career at age 22 while still in graduate school. She spoke about her motivation as a mother of three with a high-profile job as a member of Congress and chair of the Democratic National Committee.\n\n\u201cI have the next generation in the back seat of my car, and I know that if I don\u2019t step up to the plate and get involved, who will?\u201d she said.\n\nWasserman Schultz said she is working harder than ever to find common ground in Congress between Republicans and Democrats as she laments the current state of dysfunction in Washington.\n\nShe also recounted her battle with breast cancer, during which she underwent seven surgeries while working as the cochair of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cWhen the ball is passed to me, I run with it,\u201d she said. She told the audience that she is celebrating her seventh anniversary as a cancer survivor.\n\nIn addition to taking questions on the Affordable Care Act, drones, Israel, and the Tea Party, she offered advice for young people who would like a career in politics.\n\nSara Hayet, president of the Senior Youth Group at MRT, asked what specific advice the legislator would have for a young woman intersted in a career in politics.\n\n\u201cTake advantage of every internship, go down to the local government offices and the offices of elected officials, and get involved in a political campaign. Grab every opportunity that comes your way,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said.\n\nLeslie Posnock Schwartz, an attorney who lives in Ocean Township, said, \u201cI was highly impressed by the congresswoman\u2019s work ethic and strength of character in the face of adversity \u2014 both life-threatening and political. I purchased her book, which I mailed to my daughter, a college freshman, today.\n\n\u201cMs. Wasserman Schultz is an outstanding role model for young women, who take the concept of tikun olam seriously.\u201d\n\nOurach noted, \u201cOver the decades of the Reform movement in Judaism, we have observed more than 50 percent of the rabbinate now being comprised of women. With the growing number of women in all professions and women\u2019s issues that really are family issues that impact everyone, it is even more important in the political realm.\n\n\u201cWomen have the ability to find more middle ground and a focus that brings different perspectives.\u201d\n\nFollowing the event in Monmouth County, Wasserman Schultz traveled to Cherry Hill for an appearance at the Katz JCC.\n\nBack to top\n\nLeave a Comment\n\nBack to top", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Jewish News, NJJN, Israel, Israeli, Israel News, Jewish New Jersey, Jewish Newspaper,\nNew Jersey Newspaper, New Jersey News, Jewish Calendar, Middle East News, Jewish Dating, New Jersey Jewish News,\nJews, American Jewish News, NJ Jews, NJ Jewish News, New Jersey Jewish Community, Jewish Books, Jewish Federation,\nKosher Restaurants, Kosher Recipes, Jewish Customs, Jewish Travel, Greater MetroWest, MetroWest, Central NJ, Central New Jersey,\neditorials, editors column, commentary, Princeton, Mercer County, Monmouth County, Somerset County, Middlesex County", "og": {"image": "http://njjewishnews.com/images/uploads/150thumbs/SchultzSixO150.jpg", "site_name": "New Jersey Jewish News | NJJN", "title": "Fla. pol urges women to \u2018get in the game\u2019"}, "description": "Rep.
