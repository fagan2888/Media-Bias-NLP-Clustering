No, not the clueless former Kansas Gov.(D), but former senator (he lost his seat in 2004 to Republican) from South Dakota Tom Daschle.\n\nDaschle is a little guy, but he\u2019s tough, shrewd, and as a former Democratic majority leader, he understood power. He knew how to negotiate, and that meant sometimes negotiating with Republicans. (Healthcare reform was a particular interest; he had by then written one book on the subject and would co-write another in 2010.)\n\nAfter his defeat, Daschle, who is not a lawyer, signed on as a \u201cspecial public policy adviser\u201d at the Washington office of the Atlanta law firm Alston & Bird. (Though not officially a lobbyist, never having registered as one, he was close, and he was married to an aviation lobbyist.)\n\nDaschle had the usual complex ties of a Washington bigwig, and it was soon discovered that he had neglected to pay $128,203 in taxes the three years previous. Some was unreported income he received for advising a private equity fund; some involved the personal use of a car and driver given to him by an employer. Like Geithner, who claimed he did his own taxes using Turbo Tax, Daschle said he had made an innocent mistake. He filed amended returns and promptly paid what he owed plus $11,964 in interest.\n\nObama stuck with Daschle as long as he could. \u201cThe president has confidence that Sen. Daschle is the right person to lead the fight for healthcare reform,\u201d press secretary, Robert Gibbs said. But Obama had demonized lobbyists during the campaign, and he saw that Daschle\u2019s path through confirmation would be difficult and that the presidential honeymoon would be ruined by charges of hypocrisy. So Obama apologized and, in February 2009, Daschle withdrew, explaining that his appointment would be a \u201cdistraction\u201d that could harm the goal of \u201caffordable healthcare for every American.\u201d Obama then turned to Sebelius.\n\nOn \u201cMeet The Press\u201d Sunday, David Gregory, discussing the horrendous rollout of ObamaCare, asked, \"where is Bobby Kennedy? ... Who has got the muscle in the White House to get it [the website] done and make sure the president gets what he wants?\u201d\n\nDaschle had the muscle; Sebelius did not.\n\nWho can resist asking, would things have been different if Daschle had paid his taxes in full and on time? I think yes. He would have asked the right questions, demanded answers; he would not have crossed his fingers and hoped the website worked when it was switched on Oct. 1.\n\nOne of the reasons often given for Obama\u2019s refusal to fire Sebelius is how in the world would he get another nominee through the Senate. Obama should take on that fight while Democrats are still in control. Daschle was well liked in the Senate, and he might just make it \u2014 assuming there are no further innocent mistakes on his tax returns.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Daschle is a little guy, but he\u2019s tough, shrewd, and as a former majority leader, he understood power.
