× DHS warning Oklahomans about assistance scam

OKLAHOMA CITY – Officials are warning Oklahomans about a scam that has been documented in several areas, including the Sooner State.

The Oklahoma Department of Human Services says scammers are calling people and claiming to be with the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.

They claim the Treasury Department can hand out large sums of money in exchange for a smaller fee that is sent to them.

The scammers have also asked for personal banking information.

Organizers say the phone number associated with the scams stems from a 202 area code, which is in Washington D.C.

Victims say the scammers use phrases like “Affordable Care Act” and “American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.” Officials say those are government services but are not related to the TANF program.

The victims of the scam are usually lower-income and elderly people.

DHS officials say they do not make calls asking people to sign up for the TANF program.

Also, DHS will never ask you for money in order to receive assistance.

Instead, officials say if you receive a call like this, hang up and do not share any personal information.
