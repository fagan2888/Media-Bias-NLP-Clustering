Further, an article published by Deseret News seemingly suggests that she is \u201crejecting\u201d a tea party label.\n\nLove, a Republican, appeared at a fundraiser luncheon and a subsequent town hall alongside former Florida Congressman Allen West. The two discussed the Obamacare battle in Congress and the methods used by conservatives to fight President Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law.\n\nLove contended that \u201cshutting down government did not stop Obamacare\u201d and she said she would have chosen a different route than the one championed by Sen. Like Lee (R-Utah) and other conservative members of Congress, Deseret News reported.\n\n\u201cWhat (Lee) was trying to do, I understand,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to bash Mike Lee for trying to keep his promises. I think I would have taken a different approach.\u201d\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune said that Love wouldn\u2019t answer questions about whether she would have voted for the budget bill that inevitably ended the shutdown, calling it a hypothetical.\n\n\u201cI support trying to defund [it]. I support trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she told the audience. \u201cThe problem with the way everything went is shutting down the government didn\u2019t touch the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nAs for those trying to foist labels upon her, Love told Deseret News in an interview that she isn\u2019t all that interested in being \u201cput in a box.\u201d\n\n\u201cI consider myself a Republican in the state of Utah who represents everyone,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople try to put labels on you, and I don\u2019t believe in labels.\u201d\n\nDeseret News reported that Love said she didn\u2019t \u201ceven know what to say\u201d when she was asked if she was trying to distance herself from the tea party, although the context of this remark is unclear. While the outlet\u2019s headline claims Love \u201crejects a tea party label,\u201d full quotations corroborating this are not given.\n\nLove provided the following statement to TheBlaze on Thursday addressing the \u201cconfusion over\u201d the \u201cpoorly-written article\u201d in the Deseret News:\n\nThere\u2019s been some confusion over a poorly-written article by Lisa Riley Roche of the Deseret News, so let me make clear my position. My vote over the shutdown would have been the same as that of Utah\u2019s other GOP House members \u2013 Jason Chaffetz, Rob Bishop, and Chris Stewart. I would have voted against funding Obamacare and voted to keep open the rest of the government. I would not have voted, as Jim Matheson did, to continue the reckless rate of spending that President Obama and Harry Reid have insisted on. I believe it\u2019s wrong for us to kick the can down the road by shackling our children and grandchildren with our debt. Unfortunately, a false narrative exists out there that I disagree with Senator Mike Lee\u2019s goals and commitment. Here\u2019s the truth: Aside from state legislators, I was the only elected leader who stood with Senator Lee at his rally earlier this month. Senator Lee\u2019s devotion to limited government, fiscal discipline, and personal responsibility is a goal I share, and I\u2019m proud to have stood with approximately 2,000 fellow Utahns on a cold, November morning to applaud his commitment to defunding Obamacare and putting Utah first.\n\nClaims that she is trying to distance herself from the tea party \u201clabel\u201d were not fully addressed, but we are attempting to get further clarification.\n\nIn an appearance earlier in the day on KSL Radio\u2019s \u201cThe Doug Wright Show,\u201d Love said that she is open to hearing from people of all partisan stripes as she prepares for a battle for the 4th congressional district next year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that people know I\u2019m here to listen to everybody\u2019s voice \u2014 from Democrat to Republican and everything in between, because what\u2019s happening in Washington right now is absolutely \u2014 it\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d said Love, who will face Rep. Jim Matheson (D-Utah) if she gets the Republican nomination.\n\n(H/T: Deseret News)\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Congressional candidate and\u00a0Saratoga Springs Mayor Mia Love caught some attention on Wednesday for disagreeing with conservative tactics that led to the recent government shutdown and for reportedly steering clear of embracing the tea party label during an appearance at\u00a0Salt Lake Community College.
