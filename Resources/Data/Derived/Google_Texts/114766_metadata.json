He\u2019s an American hero and he has a resume for anyone to marvel at.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Carson, the only African-American candidate in the race, has a biography that sets him apart from his competitors. Raised by a single mom with only a third-grade education in inner-city Detroit, Carson went on to become the head of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital, the first African-American and youngest doctor to hold the position. In 1997, he led a team of surgeons in successfully separating conjoined twins attached at the head, an accomplishment that led him to be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nIt\u2019s that unique background mixed with a brand of fiery conservatism that appeals to grassroots Republican activists, all wrapped in a more understated demeanor than his rival, Donald Trump, that appear to be propelling Carson closer to the top tier of the 2012 GOP nominating contest. A Monmouth University poll, released Thursday, found Carson in second place nationally among Republican and Republican-leaning voters, securing 18 percent of the vote versus Trump\u2019s 30 percent.\n\nIn particular, Carson appears to be making inroads among evangelicals and social conservatives in Iowa, the state that holds the crucial first in the nation caucuses. There, Carson has secured 18 percent of the vote, to Trump\u2019s 23 percent, according to a recent Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register poll.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s genuine, he\u2019s nice, he\u2019s smart, he understands the issues and he connects with people,\u201d said state Sen. Rob Taylor, Carson\u2019s Iowa co-chair. \u201cHe\u2019s not a political insider\u2014he comes from the private sector, from health care, business and philanthropy, and all three of those sectors connect and affect people in this state.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t expect Carson, another political outsider with no experience in elected office, to soothe the Republican establishment. He may lack Trump\u2019s bombastic manner, but Carson is no stranger to controversy and some observers have questioned whether he\u2019s any more electable than Trump.\n\nWatts concedes that Carson\u2019s essential message was the same as the larger-than-life business mogul\u2019s and tapping into the same rising frustration from GOP voters\u2014just delivered in a more low-key way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a similar song, a similar tune in a different key and I think people make a choice of which key they like,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand the brashness of Donald Trump\u2026but the quiet appeal and the quiet leadership of someone of Dr. Carson\u2019s intellect appeals to a lot of voters.\u201d\n\nCarson became a darling of conservative media in 2013 when he delivered a scathing assessment of the Obama administration\u2019s policies at the National Prayer Breakfast, a typically nonpartisan venue, standing only feet away from where President Barack Obama himself sat. Comparing the United States to ancient Rome, Carson railed, \"Moral decay. Fiscal irresponsibility. They destroyed themselves. If you don\u2019t think that can happen to America, you get out your books and you start reading.\"\n\nThe calls for him to run for president began shortly thereafter, despite Carson\u2019s lack of political experience.\n\nSince then, Carson has said Obamacare, the administration\u2019s signature health care law, is \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\u201d and that being gay is a choice, citing people who go into prison and change their sexual orientation as an example. He has called for the dismantling of the Department of Veterans Affairs and cited the Bible in pointing out the wisdom of a flat tax. And despite conducting research himself as a neurosurgeon that used tissue from aborted fetuses and referring patients to doctors who performed abortions, Carson has campaigned as stridently anti-abortion and called for the defunding of Planned Parenthood, an organization that came under fire last month for conducting such research.\n\nSteffen Schmidt, a political science professor at Iowa State University and a long-time observer of the Iowa caucuses, said outsider firebrands like Carson have a certain currency with voters who are disenchanted with the system of governance as it stands and are willing to try something new.\n\n\u201cThere is a real crisis in the legitimacy of politicians and especially elected politicians at the national level,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that the voters are frustrated and essentially looking for saviors\u2014 people who can try something different and don\u2019t have that political baggage.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The renowned neurosurgeon's unique background and firebrand conservatism strikes a chord with voters", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/9/6/ben-carson-delivers-same-tune-as-trump-in-a-different-key.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/dam/ajam/images/articles_2015/09/Carson-rising__hp.jpg", "height": 913}, "type": "article", "description": "The renowned neurosurgeon's unique background and firebrand conservatism strikes a chord with voters", "title": "Ben Carson rises, delivering same tune as Trump in a different key"}, "LastModifiedDate": "Sun, 06 Sep 2015 18:03:12 GMT", "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/dam/ajam/images/articles_2015/09/Carson-rising__hp.jpg", "description": "The renowned neurosurgeon's unique background and firebrand conservatism strikes a chord with GOP voters", "site": "@AJAM", "card": "summary", "title": "Ben Carson rises, delivering same tune as Trump in a different key"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Election 2016, Politics, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc645\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe\u2019s genuine, he\u2019s nice, he\u2019s smart, he understands the issues and he connects with people,\u201d said state Sen.\nRob Taylor, Carson\u2019s Iowa co-chair.\nThere, Carson has secured 18 percent of the vote, to Trump\u2019s 23 percent, according to a recent Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register poll.\nBen Carson, a renowned brain surgeon turned presidential aspirant, can accurately boast that he is the only candidate who voters approach on the campaign to thank for his medical services.\nIn particular, Carson appears to be making inroads among evangelicals and social conservatives in Iowa, the state that holds the crucial first in the nation caucuses."}
