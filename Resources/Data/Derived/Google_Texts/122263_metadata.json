(Facebook: Oregon Nurses Association)\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN 6) \u2014 The 100-year-old Oregon Nurses Association has endorsed Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley over Oregon pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. Monica Wehby.\n\nJeff Merkley\u2019s press secretary, Lindsey O\u2019Brien, said Tuesday the endorsement hinged on both candidates\u2019 positions on the Supreme Courts\u2019 Hobby Lobby ruling on the Affordable Care Act, which gave employers the right deny employees health coverage for birth control based on religious beliefs.\n\nWehby stood in favor of the ruling, which passed in June, while Merkley opposed it.\n\nOregon Nurses Association Director Susan King said \u201cas nurses, we understand how important it is to ensure everyone has access to the full range of health care services, and Jeff is the only candidate in this race fighting against efforts to limit patients\u2019 health care options and take away access to essential health care services.\u201d\n\nMerkley\u2019s wife, Mary Sorteberg, is an Oregon nurse.\n\nWehby, one of Oregon\u2019s top pediatric medical professionals, opposed the Affordable Care Act from its inception in 2009 and has championed more competition for health insurance plans.\n\nMonica Wehby\u2019s Communications Director, Dean Petrone, called the endorsement \u201codd.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an odd endorsement seeing that Jeff Merkley championed a law responsible for canceling the health plans of 150,000 Oregonians, raising patient costs, cutting benefits to seniors, and reducing access to quality, affordable healthcare,\u201d he said.\n\nPetrone also challenged Merkley\u2019s support for Medicare.\n\nMerkley, he said, \u201cvot[ed] on three separate occasions against preventing cuts to Medicare Advantage and once for one of the biggest cuts in Medicare history.\u201d\n\nBut, O\u2019Brien said a Wehby-backed budget would force \u201cextreme cuts\u201d to Medicare, Social Security, and would jeopardize seniors\u2019 retirement benefits. Petrone called those cuts \u201cconjectural.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nRegardless, Oregon has one of the highest percentages of Medicare Advantage enrollees in the nation. As Cover Oregon enrollees transition to the Affordable Care Act, health and health policy remain central issues in the Oregon Senate debate.", "article_metadata": {"norton-safeweb-site-verification": "46bykeo2i0s-akw2xw95c4niny8dm8q2hq2q--p6sq9m44il5276m4e6zl3aewxb9eje2k-8ahjwqf4l2xznzs7ryf88y3cugtu9sy16hu69onbc-aftcwjs4pwj7f74", "zipcodes": "97201, 97203, 97204, 97205, 97206, 97207, 97208, 97209, 97210, 97211, 97212, 97213, 97214, 97215, 97216, 97227, 97266, 97005, 97225, 97015, 98661, 97030", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.koin", "og": {"site_name": "KOIN 6", "description": "Monica Wehby campaign called the endorsement \u2018odd,\u2019 citing Merkley\u2019s past votes on Medicare.", "title": "Oregon Nurses endorse Jeff Merkley over Dr. Wehby", "url": "http://koin.com/2014/08/26/oregon-nurses-endorse-jeff-merkley-over-dr-wehby/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://lintvkoin.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/oregon-nurses.jpg", "height": 359}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Monica Wehby campaign called the endorsement \u2018odd,\u2019 citing Merkley\u2019s past votes on Medicare.", "title": "Oregon Nurses endorse Jeff Merkley over Dr. Wehby", "image": {"src": "https://lintvkoin.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/oregon-nurses.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@koinnews", "site": "koinnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Portland Breaking News, Weather, Sports and Traffic", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=411685184", "fb": {"pages": 201148780086040}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://koin.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/14b04f7776cb146ac02da7d9f2520ae3?s=16", "application-name": "KOIN 6", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/koin6", "published_time": "2014-08-26T23:06:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-09T18:39:32+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "vzU_UZiJT4xFXAdXje_mcSljJEG-ROUbQhc5qkumYRE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d9d\"", "article_summary": "(Facebook: Oregon Nurses Association)PORTLAND, Ore.
