After arriving at Eppley, the famous investor and business magnate talked with KETV NewsWatch 7.

“I think my biggest strength will be national security, and military and taking care of the vets,” Trump said. “We have old equipment. We're not spending the money, and where we are spending the money is we're giving it to countries that don't even like us or respect us.”

Trump went from an afternoon press conference at the airport to a round-table discussion at the Omaha Press Club. He criticized current and past leaders on defense, trade and economic policies. He also highlighted his own experience.

“I’m good at fixing things,” he said. “I’m good at making money. I’m good at making things good.”

Organizers of the Lincoln Reagan Dinner said Trump is also good at raising funds for the GOP.

“It turned out to be the best event we’ve ever had in Pottawattamie County for a presidential candidate,” said Jeffery Jorgenson, chair of the Pottawattamie County Republican Party.

Harrison Johnson, of the University of Nebraska at Omaha College Republicans, said Trump delivered an interesting speech.

“It was a good speech,” Johnson said. “You know, Mr. Trump’s a nice guy.”

Republicans at the event said the biggest take away from the speech was the question of if he plans to run for president.

“He’s running for president, that’s what I think,” Jorgenson said. “He’s talking like somebody who is going to be running for president this time around.”

Trump said he will make an official announcement in June.
