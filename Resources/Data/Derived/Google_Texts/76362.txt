WPD DUI checkpoint

The Wichita Police Department conducted a DUI checkpoint Saturday night through early Sunday morning on East 13th street North and North Ohio Avenue.

Police set up the checkpoint on the west bound lanes of Ohio Ave. pulling people into the street and some into the parking lot near there to be tested from 11 p.m. Saturday night until 3 a.m. Sunday morning.

"These types of events are good in a sense that we don't want to intrude on people's liberty and movement through traffic, but we do want to take impaired drivers off of the road," Sgt. Chris Mcauliffe said.

Sgt. Mcauliffe said that it was just by coincidence and due to some scheduling conflicts that they conducted their DUI checkpoint within a week of the Sheriff's sobriety checkpoint.

More details on arrests will be released later on today.
