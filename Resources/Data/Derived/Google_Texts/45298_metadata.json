Court after court has ruled that the Obama administration has found an acceptable workaround for nonprofit religious organizations who don\u2019t want to provide birth control coverage to their employees. Nonetheless, yet another case will be decided soon in Denver, brought by the Little Sisters of the Poor.\n\nAs the New York Times notes today, four federal appeals courts have ruled that the Obama administration\u2019s contraception compromise is acceptable. If religious nonprofits don\u2019t want to provide birth control coverage, they fill out a short form opting out; contraceptive coverage is then provided directly by the insurer, without going through the employer.\n\nThat plan is not amenable to the Little Sisters of the Poor, who run a series of care facilities for low-income elderly people. They brought suit in September 2013 with the help of a law firm called the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty; on an informational page, Becket writes that even this thirdhand proximity to birth control is an affront to the Sisters\u2019 beliefs. They say the government is \u201cforcing\u201d them to hire a third party to provide birth control their employees:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the government does allow exemptions for church and church-type entities from the HHS Mandate for religious reasons, this accommodation does nothing for the Little Sisters. Because the government refuses to classify them as a \u201creligious employer,\u201d the Little Sisters are required to hire a third party to provide these objectionable services to their employees, and thus are still forced to participate in the government\u2019s scheme. Believing that every human person has God-given worth, the Little Sisters cannot provide contraceptive, abortion, and sterilization services that go against their religious beliefs.\n\n\n\nThe issue for the Sisters seems to be that the federal government has to use information from their healthcare plan in order to provide contraceptive coverage, which they argue makes them \u201ccomplicit.\u201d They also want to be classified as a religious employer, not a religious nonprofit. A video produced by the Becket Fund claims that the government has decided they are \u201cnot religious enough for a religious exemption,\u201d which is a pretty misleading way to word things.\n\nSponsored\n\nA hearing in the case was held last December at the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, and it could be decided at any time. But as Emily Bazelon pointed out last year, this whole thing could be an \u201cempty exercise,\u201d given that the Little Sisters\u2019 third-party healthcare administrator is another religious entity, one called Christian Brothers Services. They also can\u2019t be required to provide birth control coverage. The Little Sisters lawsuit is actually a class action, asking that anyone who gets insurance through the Christian Brothers not be required to cover or opt out of covering birth control.\n\nIn a Q&A on the case, the Becket Fund claimed that the Little Sisters are being treated as \u201csecond class citizens\u201d:\n\n\n\n[T]he law still forces the Little Sisters to participate in providing access to the drugs and treats the Little Sisters as second-class citizens. First, the government has refused to simply exempt the Little Sisters\u2014even though it exempts churches and other religious organizations. That is wrong\u2014the Little Sisters should receive the same exemption churches do. Second, the so-called \u201caccommodation\u201d still forces the Little Sisters to find an insurer who will cover sterilization, contraceptive and abortion-inducing drugs and devices, and will provide related counseling and education to promote those things. The Sisters would also be required to sign a form that triggers the start of that coverage. In good conscience, they can\u2019t do that. So the \u201caccommodation\u201d still violates their religious beliefs.\n\nThe upshot here is that even if the court rules against the Little Sisters, they will still probably find a way to delay letting their employees get access to contraception, or even avoid it entirely. Just as Christ would\u2019ve done.\n\n\n\nContact the author at anna.merlan@jezebel.com.\n\nPublic PGP key\n\nPGP fingerprint: 67B5 5767 9D6F 652E 8EFD 76F5 3CF0 DAF2 79E5 1FB6\n\nAdvertisement", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "birth control, obamacare, little sisters of the poor, contraception coverage, contraception opt-out, insurance, religious nonprofits, Jezebel", "author": "Anna Merlan", "og": {"site_name": "Jezebel", "description": "Another day, another endless lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception coverage mandate.
