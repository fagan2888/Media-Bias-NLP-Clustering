Finding the cancer is done with a colonoscopy, a procedure that saved Joey England\u2019s life.\n\nAsk any doctor: Men don\u2019t like to talk about colonoscopies, much less get one. Only about one-third of adults 50 or older \u2014 the age group at the greatest risk of developing colorectal cancer \u2014 get regular screenings, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nevada has one of the lowest screening rates in the country.\n\n\u201cCancer doesn\u2019t have age limits,\u201d said Dr. Tam T. Nguyen, a board-certified radiation oncologist with 21st Century Oncology. \u201cWhile colonoscopies are uncomfortable, they save lives. Colorectal cancers are often slow-growing and highly curable if found early.\u201d\n\nEngland, 45, an east valley resident, can attest to its life-saving benefits. Ten years ago, he noticed blood in his stool and dismissed it as hemorrhoids. Then he began experiencing abdominal discomfort. As the director of U.S. sales and customer support for E-Band Communication LLC, he traveled a lot. Over the next decade, the condition got worse, including cramping, and he said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t make a flight without going to the bathroom first.\u201d\n\nEngland delayed seeing a doctor, saying he was \u201cbeing bullheaded, until my wife, Melisa, insisted.\u201d\n\nHis primary care physician suspected diverticulitis and prescribed penicillin, an antibiotic. It worked great \u2014 for two weeks. Then the cramps and discomfort returned with a vengeance, and he went back to his doctor.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018You\u2019re five years too young for a colonosopy, but let\u2019s push for that,\u2019 \u201d England recalled.\n\nOnce his insurance OK\u2019d it, he had the procedure. The doctor sat England and his wife down and gave them the result: He had a cancerous tumor resulting in a 90 percent blockage in his colon. He needed an operation immediately to give him an ileostomy bag or he risked toxins entering his body, which could lead to death.\n\n\u201cI was in shock. It took a week to sink in, that this was real, this was happening to me,\u201d England said. \u201cThere was a lot going on in our lives. We were buying a house at the time. We closed on it Dec. 21 and moved in. On Dec. 23, I was in surgery,\u201d he said.\n\nNow saddled with the bag, England underwent 28 sessions of radiation treatments at 21st Century Oncology to shrink the tumor, along with 14 chemotherapy sessions. He had the tumor surgically removed April 1. Even after being shrunk, the tumor was 4.5 inches long and was Stage 3 cancer.\n\n\u201cAnd I found out that I have a threshold of 10,\u201d he said, referring to the hospital chart for relaying how much pain one is feeling.\n\nEngland is still undergoing chemotherapy. In August, he will be tested for \u201chot spots\u201d to determine if he still has cancer cells in his body. After that, he will lose the ileostomy bag.\n\n\u201cIf everything is (all right), I\u2019ll have one more surgery to reverse the osteo bag and basically put Humpty Dumpty back together again,\u201d he said.\n\nAn estimated 93,090 cases of colon cancer and 39,610 cases of rectal cancer will be diagnosed this year, according to the American Cancer Society. Screening tests find precancerous polyps so they can be removed before they turn into cancer, or detect cancer early, when treatment is most effective. Screenings include colonoscopies, sigmoidoscopies and stool tests.\n\nColorectal cancers can start with no symptoms. Some people with colorectal polyps or cancer may have symptoms that include: blood in or on stool; stomach pain; aches or cramps that don\u2019t go away; and unexplained weight loss.\n\nThe 6-foot-tall England has gone from 190 pounds to 155. He\u2019s changed his diet to avoid red meat and focuses more on vegetables and salads.\n\nWhy does he think men are reluctant to have a colonoscopy?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why we\u2019re so stubborn,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cut ourselves real bad doing yard work, and we refuse to go see a doctor. \u2026 I think we\u2019re afraid of the reality of it.\u201d\n\nTo reach Summerlin Area View reporter Jan Hogan, email jhogan@viewnews.com or call 702-387-2949.", "article_metadata": {"description": "June is Men\u2019s Health Month, and colorectal cancer is the third-leading cancer killer among men.
