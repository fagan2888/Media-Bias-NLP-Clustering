On CNN\u2019s coverage of the South Carolina GOP primary results, he\u2019d had enough of the media\u2019s placating Trump\u2019s antics and the teeming hordes who eat it up.\n\nJones is absolutely right that the media has \u201cadapt[ed] to the absurdity\u201d of Trump\u2019s campaign. One of the worst ways they\u2019ve done this is by accepting the premise that his popularity is a reaction to the GOP\u2019s failure to enact change or stop Obama over the last 7 years. As Erick Erickson put it six months ago: \u201cThe Republican Party created Donald Trump, because they made a lot of promises to their base and never kept them.\u201d\n\nWhat a load of hogwash. Here\u2019s why.\n\nRepublicans have been campaigning since 2009 on a few major issues: stopping or repealing national healthcare reform, securing the border, protecting gun rights, fighting terrorism, and reducing spending. Trump\u2019s premise is that they have failed on these and other promises.\n\nHave elected Republicans failed on any of these items, and is Trump any better? Let\u2019s see.\n\nObamacare hasn\u2019t been repealed, but it can\u2019t be without a supermajority in Congress and/or control of the presidency. The border isn\u2019t 100% secured, of course, and Obama has unconstitutionally enacted an executive amnesty program, but illegal immigration is down, and executive amnesty is on hold in court.\n\nObama has also passed a couple rounds of executive orders on guns, but none of them do much to curtail gun rights, and both gun sales and concealed carry permits are through the roof. Many Republican-led states have also further expanded gun rights with open carry laws and concealed carry reciprocity.\n\nNational security and fighting terrorism are largely executive responsibilities, so it would be hard for Republicans to have failed there. And as tragic and shocking as they are, terrorism deaths are so rare as to be statistically insignificant.\n\nFinally, while federal spending is up, the Republican-led Congress has kept it from increasing as much as Obama\u2019s budget requests would like, including the first net reduction in federal spending in decades through sequestration. The deficit has decreased every year since Republicans won back the House of Representatives, and those elected at the state level have been even better at reducing government spending and programs in their states.\n\nMore importantly than Republican success on (or lack of power to address) these issues, where does Donald Trump stand on them? I suppose first we have to ask which day it is.\n\nWhile Trump vows to repeal Obamacare, he supports an alternative national government-funded and mandated healthcare plan. Trump now swears he\u2019s a \u201cSecond Amendment guy\u201d but has supported any number of gun regulations in the past, not to mention contributed to Democrats for decades as they tried to restrict those rights.\n\nTrump doesn\u2019t really have a foreign policy or counterterrorism plan, other than to ban Muslims from the country and let Russia deal with Daesh. He also has yet to articulate a small government vision over the last nine months, so he can\u2019t possibly be counted on to reduce spending.\n\nSo what\u2019s left? Border Keynesianism. He\u2019s going to build a wall and (not) make someone else pay for it, and he\u2019s going to deport 12 million taxpayers.\n\nOn these issues and others, it becomes clear that Trump\u2019s supporters simply don\u2019t care about his (total lack of) actual ideas and policy. Where it can be argued that Republicans have been less than successful, Trump is either worse or was recently enough to not be trusted. So what\u2019s left?\n\nBlatant xenophobia. Whether it be Mexicans, Muslims, or even the people primarily responsible for his success, our problems are always someone else\u2019s fault, and Trump is going to punish them for it. And brutally.\n\nOn Friday as an example of \u201ctough\u201d counterterrorism policy, Trump cited an urban legend about a US general shooting terrorism suspects with bullets dipped in pigs\u2019 blood. The presumably largely Christian crowd erupted in thunderous applause, of course. Never mind that the event never took place and Muslims don\u2019t care any more about being shot with swine-tainted bullets than with regular ones.\n\nThat anecdote, his tendency to retweet his white supremacists, and the primary focus of Trump\u2019s campaign - the myth of the ongoing criminal alien invasion - should be all the evidence that anyone needs. Trump voters aren\u2019t well-meaning aggrieved conservatives. They\u2019re not enough conservative, and neither is Dear Leader.\n\nTrump voters are largely just racists who\u2019ve been without someone insane enough to explicitly cater to their base desires in a very long time. Their savior has come, only this time he\u2019s not wearing a white hood.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Donald Trump,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "DC.Title": "Trump Voters Weren't Betrayed by the GOP, He's Their White Knight", "robots": "index,follow", "copyright": "(c) 2005-2013 United Liberty", "description": "A broken clock is right twice a day, and Saturday night Van Jones was that malfunctioning timepiece.
