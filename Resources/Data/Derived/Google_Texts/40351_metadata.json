Martin O\u2019Malley was attacked for enforcing the law in a violent, dangerous city. Hillary even called herself a \u201cWashington outsider,\u201d who was \u201cfeared by Iran.\u201d It was beyond backwards\u2014it was simply bizarre.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIt was a liberal circus with candidates jockeying so aggressively to out-flank each other, they nearly fell off the left side of the stage. More moderate Jim Webb would have been left to himself on the stage.\n\nThe bombastic climate change rhetoric was especially nuts. Forget ISIS beheadings, Iran, or a Middle East arms race, the biggest threat facing our nation is a sunburn. According to the candidates, we must immediately abandon our homes, jobs, cars, and air conditioning\u2014or risk engulfing American communities in a solar Armageddon!\n\nWith today\u2019s Left, keeping Americans safe and killing our enemies is \u201cuncool.\u201d Republicans were repeatedly attacked for wanting to kill terrorists and defeat radical Islam. On immigration, everyone pandered with amnesty promises and ObamaCare benefits for illegal immigrants.\n\nBernie Sanders sounded like Santa Claus with his repeated call for free toys, free college, free healthcare, and free lunches. Hillary Clinton\u2019s historical account of her State Department tenure made her sound like Winston Churchill. Former Secretary of the Navy (under Reagan) Jim Webb sounded more like a Republican than many of our congressional leaders in Washington. One has to applaud his recognition that America faces threats beyond the global thermostat.\n\nAt times, many thought we were watching a salacious, Berkeley University student council debate, but unfortunately, this IS the modern-day Democratic Party. For those of us who thought it was impossible to be more liberal than President Obama, last night we were proved wrong. Who knew Obama was so conservative?\n\nIt was appropriate to finish the debate with a question on marijuana because liberals are smoking it if they believe their policies will save this country.\n\nFormer Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is a Republican candidate for president.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Democrat Debate was a liberal circus, with candidates jockeying so aggressively they nearly fell off the left side of the stage.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The Democrat Debate was a liberal circus, with candidates jockeying so aggressively they nearly fell off the left side of the stage.", "title": "Exclusive - Huckabee on 'Simply Bizarre' Democrat Debate: A 'Liberal Circus' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/GettyImages-Huckabee.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/14/exclusive-huckabee-on-simply-bizarre-democrat-debate-a-liberal-circus/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Democrat Debate was a liberal circus, with candidates jockeying so aggressively they nearly fell off the left side of the stage.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/GettyImages-Huckabee.jpg", "title": "Exclusive - Huckabee on 'Simply Bizarre' Democrat Debate: A 'Liberal Circus' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Democrat debate", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2015-10-14T14:52:12-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8145\"", "article_summary": "Bernie Sanders sounded like Santa Claus with his repeated call for free toys, free college, free healthcare, and free lunches.\nHillary even called herself a \u201cWashington outsider,\u201d who was \u201cfeared by Iran.\u201d It was beyond backwards\u2014it was simply bizarre.\nFormer Secretary of the Navy (under Reagan) Jim Webb sounded more like a Republican than many of our congressional leaders in Washington.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAfter the first Democratic debate Tuesday night, it\u2019s clear the anti-gun, environmentalist, crazy wing has taken over the Democrat asylum.\nAt times, many thought we were watching a salacious, Berkeley University student council debate, but unfortunately, this IS the modern-day Democratic Party."}
