A water main break in east Denver on Friday morning swallowed a van in a sink hole and cut off water to 20 homes, officials said.

The break happened near the intersection of 35th Avenue and Oneida Street, where water flooded the area.

A witness told The Denver Post the van began floating in the water before sinking into the hole. Crews have extricated the vehicle, which was submerged up to its door windows.

The break happened when an eight inch in diameter pipe ruptured.

“Our crew is going to start the work to make repairs, but they have to pump out the hole,” said Stacy Chesney, a spokeswoman for Denver Water, adding that the pipe will be repaired today.
