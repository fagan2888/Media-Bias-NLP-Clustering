Stop-loss allows these employers to protect themselves from bigger claims that could wipe them out. About 60 percent of insured American workers are in self-insured plans. Most of these workers are either in unions or employed by larger companies.\n\nA push to limit employers\u2019 access to stop-loss insurance has picked up steam, amounting to one of the biggest battles facing the industry in years. Stop-loss insurance is state-regulated, and in the last year the topic has come up in legislatures across the country. By the end of 2013, four states had passed laws restricting stop-loss in one way or another.\n\nAs part of that effort, the Self-Insurance Protection Act that was introduced late last year by Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. The legislation seeks to clarify existing law to ensure that federal regulators cannot re-define stop-loss insurance as traditional health insurance. Such a designation, they say, could force many self-insured entities that retain stop-loss insurance to discontinue their health plans.\n\n\n\nIf passed by Congress, the law would merely amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act to exclude from the definition of health insurance coverage certain medical stop-loss insurance.\n\nSIIA and other supporters take pains to point out the legislation does not amend the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and it does not direct the administration to implement the law in a specific way. Rather, it is \u201cintended to ensure that small- and mid-sized private sector employers, as well as smaller Taft-Hartley Plans and public sector entities, are able to continue to provide quality health benefits to their workers and members through self-insured group health plans,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\n\nSIIA President and CEO Mike Ferguson said that \u201cgiven the current disruption we are seeing in the individual health insurance marketplace due to how ACA implementation rules were crafted, the timing of this legislation is particularly important in order to prevent a similar scenario in the self-insured group health marketplace.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Stephenie Overman", "description": "By the end of 2013, four states had passed laws restricting stop-loss in one way or another.", "og": {"url": "http://www.benefitspro.com/2014/01/13/self-insurance-industry-fights-back", "image": "http://media.benefitspro.com/benefitspro/article/2014/01/13/bill cassidy.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "By the end of 2013, four states had passed laws restricting stop-loss in one way or another.", "title": "Self-insurance industry fights back"}, "twitter": {"description": "By the end of 2013, four states had passed laws restricting stop-loss in one way or another.", "title": "Self-insurance industry fights back", "image": {"src": "http://media.benefitspro.com/benefitspro/article/2014/01/13/bill-cassidy-tnail-crop-120x120.jpg"}, "creator": "@Benefits_Pro", "site": "@Benefits_Pro", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-13", "sailthru.tags": "benefitspro, article, 52d441eb140ba0fb360000d6, In-Depth, Employer-paid,Compliance,Cost-containment,Employee  Participation,C-Suite", "keywords": "Employer-paid, Employee  Participation, Compliance, Cost-containment, C-Suite, Kathleen Sebelius, Tennessee, Utah, Rhode Island, health insurance coverage, National Association of Insurance Commissioners, Jerry Brown, health insurance policies, healthcare reform, Lamar Alexander, stop-loss insurance, Self-Insurance Institute of America, Bill Cassidy, Self-Insurance Defense Coalition, Mike Ferguson, medical stop-loss insurance, Adam Russo, law restricting, Phia Group", "sniply-options": "block", "sailthru.image.full": "http://media.benefitspro.com/benefitspro/article/2014/01/13/bill cassidy.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde816\"", "article_summary": "A push to limit employers\u2019 access to stop-loss insurance has picked up steam, amounting to one of the biggest battles facing the industry in years.\nStop-loss insurance is state-regulated, and in the last year the topic has come up in legislatures across the country.\nThe legislation seeks to clarify existing law to ensure that federal regulators cannot re-define stop-loss insurance as traditional health insurance.\nSuch a designation, they say, could force many self-insured entities that retain stop-loss insurance to discontinue their health plans.\nAbout 60 percent of insured American workers are in self-insured plans."}
