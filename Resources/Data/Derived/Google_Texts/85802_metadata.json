The EPA said it can cause respiratory problems and harm vegetation, and is often a component in smog.\n\nAreas that exceed the standard must take action to try to lower their concentrations.\n\nThe Utility Air Regulatory Group, backed by mining and power generation companies, had appealed a lower court\u2019s decision last year that also upheld the standard.\n\nThe Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) said the rejection is critical to protecting clean air.\n\n\u201cMillions of Americans are harmed by smog pollution and the court\u2019s decision is a welcome end to efforts by large coal-based power companies to derail vital clean air protections for our communities and families,\u201d EDF senior attorney Peter Zalzal said in a statement.\n\nThe EPA is in the process of deciding whether to further restrict the standard, a move that the National Association of Manufacturers said could be the most costly regulation ever.\n\nThe agency's staff and science advisers have asked it to reduce the standard to between 60 and 70 parts per billion. The agency will make a decision on whether to propose new restrictions by December.\n\nLike the other decisions Monday to reject cases, the Supreme Court did not explain its denial.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A business group claims the EPA rules are too strict.", "description": "A business group claims the EPA rules are too strict.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Timothy Cama", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A business group claims the EPA rules are too strict.", "title": "Supreme Court won\u2019t hear challenge to EPA ozone standard", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/219853-supreme-court-wont-hear-challenge-to-epa-ozone-standard", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:59-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/219853-supreme-court-wont-hear-challenge-to-epa-ozone-standard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-10-06T10:56-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Timothy Cama", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-06T10:56:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:59:59-05:00"}, "keywords": "Supreme Court, Ozone, Air pollution,,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/219853-supreme-court-wont-hear-challenge-to-epa-ozone-standard", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A business group claims the EPA rules are too strict.", "card": "summary", "title": "Supreme Court won\u2019t hear challenge to EPA ozone standard"}, "dcterms.title": "Supreme Court won\u2019t hear challenge to EPA ozone standard"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0308\"", "article_summary": "The Supreme Court declined Monday to hear a business group\u2019s claim that the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) 2008 rules for ground-level ozone are too strict.\nThe Monday decision leaves intact the 75 parts-per-billion ozone standard put in place by the Bush administration, lowered from the previous 80 parts per billion.\nLike the other decisions Monday to reject cases, the Supreme Court did not explain its denial.\nThe agency's staff and science advisers have asked it to reduce the standard to between 60 and 70 parts per billion.\nThe Utility Air Regulatory Group, backed by mining and power generation companies, had appealed a lower court\u2019s decision last year that also upheld the standard."}
