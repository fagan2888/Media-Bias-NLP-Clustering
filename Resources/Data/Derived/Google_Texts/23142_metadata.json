He has joined other Republicans fighting the health care law.\n\nAnd he has lamented delays in the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to Texas. A Koch subsidiary has intervened in the project, which opponents describe as a pollution risk.\n\nThe invitation-only gathering in August offered wealthy donors a chance to meet and mingle with GOP elected officials and leaders of conservative groups linked to the Kochs.\n\nAmid tight security, traffic was blocked on the road into the secluded luxury site near Albuquerque at the base of the Sandia Mountains.\n\nThe Kochs typically have imposed secrecy around their events. Abbott declined to talk about it. His spokesman did not return a call or answer emails seeking comment. A Koch Industries spokeswoman did not respond.\n\nIn his latest campaign report, Abbott listed $7,500 from Koch Industries for the use of an airplane in early August, the week of the gathering.\n\nA few days after the event, Abbott held a news conference in Austin. He pledged to \u201cnever stop fighting\u201d against the Affordable Care Act. Joining him were members of Americans for Prosperity, a group the Kochs helped create.\n\nThe Kochs operate oil refineries, control pipelines and own chemical and manufacturing interests.\n\nThey\u2019ve been instrumental in creating foundations, think tanks and political groups. That network has spent millions opposing politicians and issues that run counter to the Koch agenda.\n\nAbbott has received more than $50,000 from the Koch political committee and more than $400,000 from the Republican State Leadership Committee. Its major contributors include Koch Industries.\n\nIn the Texas governor\u2019s race, Koch interests are expected to weigh in against likely Democratic nominee Wendy Davis. Abbott allies already have labeled her anti-business. She has called Abbott too cozy with Capitol interests and his financial backers.\n\nRepublicans also have chided her for something else \u2014 traveling to posh spots outside Texas to meet with deep-pocket donors who have a political agenda and money they hope will put a friend in the Governor\u2019s Mansion.\n\nFollow Wayne Slater on Twitter at @wayneslater.\n\nwslater@dallasnews.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican candidate for governor Greg Abbott apparently met with the big-donor Koch brothers, who\u2019ve pushed an agenda that Abbott has embraced.", "og": {"description": "Republican candidate for governor Greg Abbott apparently met with the big-donor Koch brothers, who\u2019ve pushed an agenda that Abbott has embraced.", "title": "Abbott silent about Koch event", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/wayne-slater/20131216-abbott-silent-about-koch-event.ece", "image": {"width": 2634, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131209-greg-abbott.ece/BINARY/original/Greg+Abbott", "height": 3264}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2013-12-17T05:40:14Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2013-12-17T04:42:32Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Abbott silent about Koch event\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/wayne-slater/20131216-abbott-silent-about-koch-event.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131209-greg-abbott.ece/BINARY/original/Greg+Abbott\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1346295\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-17T04:42:32Z\", \"section\": \"Wayne Slater\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131209-greg-abbott.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/Greg+Abbott", "publishtime": "2013-12-17T04:42:32Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcad91\"", "article_summary": "Abbott has received more than $50,000 from the Koch political committee and more than $400,000 from the Republican State Leadership Committee.\nAUSTIN \u2014 Greg Abbott doesn\u2019t want to talk about the Koch brothers.\nIn his latest campaign report, Abbott listed $7,500 from Koch Industries for the use of an airplane in early August, the week of the gathering.\nThey\u2019ve been instrumental in creating foundations, think tanks and political groups.\nIn the Texas governor\u2019s race, Koch interests are expected to weigh in against likely Democratic nominee Wendy Davis."}
