MOSCOW, Russia — President Vladimir Putin used his annual state of the union address on Thursday to defend his hawkish foreign policy and blame the West for thrusting Russia into a geopolitical conflict that’s only gotten worse since the Kremlin annexed Crimea.

In what amounted to at times a screed that mixed historical grievances with lofty economic and social promises, Putin sidestepped the severity of Russia’s tanking currency, rising inflation and coming recession.

Instead, he blamed the West for attempting to sabotage his country’s economy and force the country to its knees — all while failing to mention that Moscow’s own aggressive posturing was a catalyst for the current crisis.

Putin called Russians to unite against what he contends is unwarranted foreign aggression, even comparing Western sanctions against Russia to Adolf Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union.

“Everyone should remember how this ends,” Putin told an audience of parliamentarians and other members of Russia’s political elite in the televised address.

Observers had struggled to predict how the president would address Russia’s worst economic crisis in years (the ruble has lost more than 40 percent of its value since the beginning of the year). Putin resorted to his time-tested strategy of blaming the West for victimizing Russia.

That narrative has gone rather well for the former KGB operative, who still enjoys sky-high approval ratings and would sweep a snap presidential race, recent polls have found.

The Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea last March — which Putin cast as a historic reclaiming of what he said was like Russia’s very own Temple Mount — was what spurred the West into punishing Russia.

Now, Putin regularly uses the same US and European sanctions that have helped pummel his country’s economy as a patriotic rallying cry to consolidate the population.
