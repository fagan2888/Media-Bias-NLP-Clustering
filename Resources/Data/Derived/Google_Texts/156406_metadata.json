Diane Black, R-Tenn., asked a panel of experts Wednesday: \u201cHave we reached a point in our society where there effectively is an Amazon.com for human parts, including human babies?\u201d\n\nWhile asking the question, Black showed those testifying an email from a medical researcher from a \u201cleading university\u201d requesting \u201ca first trimester human embryo, preferably around 8 weeks, and up to 10 weeks gestation. We have ordered tissue from [redacted] before, so our information should be on file.

Yes, they are for sale, supposedly just to cover one\u2019s costs. But those costs seem to be quite variable.\u201d\n\nPaige Comstock Cunningham, executive director for Trinity International University Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity, who also takes a pro-life stance on the procurement of tissue from aborted babies, told the committee that her concern with harvesting tissue from aborted babies is not that the practice \u201csomehow\u201d increases abortions.\n\n\u201cMy concern,\u201d Cunningham said, \u201cis that researchers have come to count on induced abortion for their research[.] \u2026 [W]hat have we come to where researchers need induced abortion for their research?\u201d\n\nBlack, a former emergency room nurse, was speaking before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives on Wednesday. The mission of the committee is to \u201cgather information and get the facts about the medical practices of abortion service providers and the business practices of procurement organization who sell baby body parts.\u201d\n\nDemocrats on the committee called the hearing a political \u201cwitch hunt\u201d by the \u201canti-abortion\u201d industry.\n\nStart the video at two minutes to see the exchange.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
