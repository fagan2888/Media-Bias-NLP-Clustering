More than 1,000 consolidations occurred in the 1990s, and mergers have ticked up again since the ACA was enacted. Some, though not all, of these consolidations are a threat to the market system, he said.\n\n( PHOTOS: POLITICO Pro Health Care Breakfast Briefing)\n\n\u201cLayered on top of many markets that are dominated by a small number of very large systems, it can be a concern so it\u2019s something we pay very close attention to,\u201d Gaynor said.\n\nBarak Richman, a Duke University law professor, said there was \u201cvery little evidence\u201d that consolidation had \u201cprovided any efficiencies at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarak is right,\u201d Gaynor said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had mergers for a very long time. There are a lot of data, and we\u2019ve seen almost no evidence of real efficiency claims. That doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen, but the most recent evidence doesn\u2019t support those claims.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The propaganda war Obama is losing)\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that mergers don\u2019t lead to more efficient care in some cases, or that there will be more evidence of it in the future, but on average that hasn\u2019t been the case so far, Gaynor said.\n\nA health care lawyer and a hospital executive said the ACA had created pressure for hospitals to innovate. That was driving mergers and acquisitions in the sector.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: CDC confirms respiratory illness in children in Midwest)\n\nThe requirement to include electronic health records is one of the pressures. The cost of such systems is \u201cungodly,\u201d said John Colmers, vice president for health care transformation at Johns Hopkins Medicine. \u201cThese are costing millions,\u201d said Sharis Pozen, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.\n\n\u201cOur physicians were struggling to adjust to EHR demands,\u201d said Deborah Zastocki, the president of Chilton Medical Center in New Jersey, which recently merged with Atlantic Health System. \u201cWe felt we needed to be aligned with best clinical practice, to be able to access clinical trials. It\u2019s not just accessing the academic information, but also the infrastructure to be able to effectively implement these quality improvements.\u201d\n\nPozen said most of the consolidation poses no anti-competition concerns. \u201cI think many \u2014 the vast majority\u201d don\u2019t raise anti-competitive issues, she said.\n\nGaynor, whose office reviews proposed mergers, said a key factor in gauging whether a new arrangement is problematic is whether or not the two merging entities would be the main source of competition in the market if they remained independent.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Climate change isn't for the birds)\n\nSuch deals have to be reviewed and if necessary fought before they happen because they are very hard to unwind once they\u2019re completed, he said.\n\n\u201cOnce competition is gone \u2014 to paraphrase Bruce Springsteen \u2014 it\u2019s gone and it ain\u2019t coming back,\u201d Gaynor said.\n\nThe merger of Chilton and Atlantic in New Jersey has enabled Chilton to deliver services more efficiently in ways that were impossible when Chilton was independent, said Zastocki.\n\n\u201cThe types of things we\u2019re able to do really are game changing,\u201d she said. \u201cThe goal is to reduce cost by 2 or 3 percent over next several years\u201d and to improve quality and access.\n\nShe mentioned that Chilton was now experimenting with how to use Google Glass \u2014 something that would have been technologically impossible if Chilton remained independent.\n\nIntegrated medical records have led to a much more efficient \u2014 and not duplicative \u2014 use of medical tests, she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "A panel discusses how the Affordable Care Act may be forcing expensive changes in hospitals.", "title": "Are hospital mergers hiking costs?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/hospital-consolidation-costs-martin-gaynor-110752.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/09/09/20140909_politico_health_care_ff_rl_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Hospitals,Health Care,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "A panel discusses how the Affordable Care Act may be forcing expensive changes in hospitals.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2418\"", "article_summary": "| Rod Lamkey Jr. for POLITICO Are hospital mergers hiking costs?\nA health care lawyer and a hospital executive said the ACA had created pressure for hospitals to innovate.\nThe cost of such systems is \u201cungodly,\u201d said John Colmers, vice president for health care transformation at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\nOther panelists at a POLITICO Pro Health Care breakfast briefing Tuesday said the ACA was forcing expensive changes that required consolidation.\nThe requirement to include electronic health records is one of the pressures driven by the ACA."}
