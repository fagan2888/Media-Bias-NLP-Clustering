President George W. Bush will be regarded by history as the last Republican President of the United States, according to Rep. Luis Gutiérrez (D-IL), if the GOP does not embrace and pass immigration reform. In a speech on the House floor on Tuesday, Gutiérrez charged that the nation’s changing demographics will doom the party in all future presidential elections if the party does not pass reform immediately.

Gutiérrez said that, even though Republican voters favor immigration reform, the party’s representatives in Congress still refuse to advance that initiative. “So, Mr. Speaker, I give you George W. Bush,” Gutiérrez said. “The man history will record was the last Republican president in American history.”

Gutiérrez said that the GOP will fade into memory “just like the Whigs and the Know Nothings” unless the party embraces immigration reform.

“If you do nothing on immigration, I guess you can take comfort in knowing that, from Abraham Lincoln to George W. Bush, you had a pretty good run,” Gutiérrez added. “Freeing the slaves, winning the Civil War, interstate highway system; those all go in the highlight column. And there have been some low lights as well.”
