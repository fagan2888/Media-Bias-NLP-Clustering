Oss | March 10, 2016\n\nThere has been lots of coverage about \u201cimporting\u201d specialist services to primary care offices via telehealth \u2013 Harvard Program Integrates Behavioral Health Into Primary Care Via Embedded Mental Health Staff & Telehealth Consultations and How Can We Deliver A Seamless Primary Care/Behavioral Health Consumer Experience?. So the recent announcement by Stanford Medicine of its new \u201cvirtual primary care clinic\u201d caught my attention (see At Stanford Medicine, A Virtual Primary Care Clinic Designed Around The Patient). I have always thought that specialist consultations could be virtual, but primary care?\n\nThe Stanford program, called ClickWell, has an interesting model. Primary care is available through a range of tech-enabled options \u2013 email, phone, and videoconferencing \u2013 as well as traditional face-to-face services. The program is open seven days a week, and offers extended office hours on weekdays \u2013 from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. and weekend days from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. \u2013 and in-person visits are not required to be prerequisites to virtual ones. In addition to primary care, wellness coaching is also available through the ClickWell system.\n\nThe statistics for the program were impressive. Seventy-one percent of new visits were in-person, with six percent as video visits and 23% as phone visits. However, among return visits, only 39% were in-person whereas 18% were video visits and 43% were telephone visits. The program reported that labor and supply costs were reduced to two-thirds of the typical costs of a brick-and-mortar clinical practice. The average face-to-face time for a video or phone visit for a new patient was 24 minutes and 21 minutes, respectively. By comparison, the average face-to-face time for an in-person visit for a new patient is 31 minutes.\n\nInterestingly, the Stanford team stated that the reason for creating the program was to serve younger consumers who didn\u2019t select primary care physicians, but were instead using urgent care centers and emergency rooms. (This concern squares with the just-released March 2016 article in Health Affairs, Retail Clinic Visits For Low-Acuity Conditions Increase Utilization And Spending, that found that retail clinic and urgent care utilization was adding to health plan costs.)\n\nThis is an example of the growth of \u201con-demand health care\u201d \u2013 a market segment that has been predicted to grow as much as 34% annually over the next few years (see The Virtual Primary Healthcare Revolution: What Health Systems Need To Know). And a quick look around finds more evidence of these \u201cvirtual primary care\u201d models gaining traction around the country over the last few years:\n\nOhio-based Cleveland Clinic launched MyCare Online in June 2015 \u2013 an app-based primary care consultation service that allows consumers to instantly connect with a doctor, nurse, or other health care professional for quick complaints such as colds, flu, rashes, or urinary tract infections (see Cleveland Clinic Launches MyCare Online). Tacoma-based MultiCare Health System announced in April 2015 that it will offer \u201cvideo doctor visits\u201d to patients throughout Washington State in partnership with Doctor on Demand (see MultiCare Offering App-Based Video Doctor Visits For $40 In Washington State). Pennsylvania-based University of Pittsburgh Medical Center launched AnywhereCare in September 2014 \u2013 a web-based platform that allows consumers to consult with a physician for primary care concerns (see UPMC Offering \u2018AnywhereCare\u2019 Telemedicine Service Across Pennsylvania). Hampton Roads-based Sentara Health Care introduced MDLive for virtual visits in 2012, allowing consumers to visit with doctors via a virtual consult platform, which also connects to pharmacies to allow for electronic prescriptions (see Sentara Jumps On Telehealth Collaboration Bandwagon). Newport News-based Riverside Health System announced in 2015 that it would provide virtual physician visits which included access to board-certified physicians 24/7/365 using a computer or a mobile device (see Riverside Expands Its Telemedicine Services With Access To 24/7 Physician Care).\n\nThese emerging virtual primary care models bring two questions to mind. First, can this same \u201cvirtual\u201d model work to provide \u201con demand\u201d targeted case management, peer support, or home health support? What would utilization \u2013 and disease management protocol adherence \u2013 look like if consumers had round-the-clock multi-modal access? And, as specialist provider organizations look to provide a \u201cseamless\u201d primary care experience, is it better to collaborate with a primary care provider organization with this \u201cvirtual\u201d approach to services?\n\nFor more, check out, Is Your Organization Ready To Be \u2018The\u2019 Care Coordinator? , Integration of Primary Care & Behavioral Health, New Perspectives On Primary Care Service Integration, or New Perspectives On Primary Care Service Integration.
