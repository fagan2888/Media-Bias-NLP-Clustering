In 2014, the sentiments behind such a decision aren\u2019t anything new, but they\u2019re becoming more and more visible in our pop culture. You know the litany already: Gender roles in the workplace and the family are blurring, outsourcing is closing factory after factory, once-secure manufacturing jobs are disappearing. \u201cAmerican men don\u2019t know how to make things anymore,\u201d and all that. For a certain slice of American men, a romance has cropped up around working the docks, or an oil rig, or a crab boat up around Alaska. You\u2019re getting back in touch with something, some supposedly inherent masculine energy that seems ever more ineffable as the nation adjusts its identity for a new era.\n\nLast year saw a handful of filmmakers take on the questions of what it means to be a man in America in the 21st century, but their films don\u2019t celebrate archetypal images of frontier manliness. Rather, they seem to suggest that looking back to these old forms is another broken urge in an age of cultural nostalgia.\n\nAfter a decade of male antihero-dominated prestige TV dramas, the problem of contemporary American masculinity had its thematic apotheosis with \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d Walt might have gotten a bleak version of a final Wild West showdown, but one of the most lasting images of the final season was that of him wasting away alone in a frozen cabin in New Hampshire. All the bluster of Heisenberg faded as Walt was corroded by the consequences of his actions \u2014 we saw up close the perversity of a man like him living alone in the woods. But while \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d did condemn old archetypes of masculinity to a degree, other stories seem to eulogize them as they slip away. Such an impulse toward eulogy has run through a handful of recent movies, most notably Jeff Nichols\u2019 \u201cMud,\u201d Derek Cianfrance\u2019s \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines\u201d and Scott Cooper\u2019s \u201cOut of the Furnace.\u201d\n\nThough they may initially seem to have little in common, the settings of each film all present classic figments of Americana as if they are synonymous with the raw nature of our country\u2019s landscape, a landscape in which listless male characters see their conceptions of life fragmenting. Each movie is shot in its own way, but each poeticizes decrepitude. The moss-covered porches and shuttered storefronts of Braddock, Pa., in \u201cOut of the Furnace\u201d aren\u2019t so different from the strip malls and Piggly Wiggly in \u201cMud.\u201d Luke and Romina, the ill-fated lovers of \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines,\u201d work as a traveling circus performer and a waitress. There\u2019s something inescapably Springsteen-esque about their struggles, emphasized by the moment where \u201cDancing in the Dark\u201d fades out as Luke walks up to the diner where Romina works.\n\nThat strain of down-on-your-luck American iconography runs through \u201cOut of the Furnace,\u201d as well. When Russell is released from jail, the very next scene begins with a shot of the road leading to the steel mill. Like much of \u201cOut of the Furnace,\u201d the symbolism isn\u2019t overly subtle: a prison lies at one end of the road, the mill at the other. That mill appears as a darkened structure nearly indistinguishable from the earth it sits upon, either as barbaric as nature or being reclaimed by nature. Everything in Braddock is in the process of becoming a ghost.\n\nCooper, Cianfrance and Nichols also turn to immortal tropes of the past to address a much more contemporary preoccupation with a fading sense of rugged American masculinity. The most overt of these is the biblical influence on \u201cMud.\u201d The isolated island where Mud lives is Edenic; it\u2019s unclear for much of the movie whether Mud himself is supposed to be the snake in the garden or the First Man. It\u2019s the battleground upon which Ellis\u2019 loss of innocence takes place, the boy\u2019s disillusionment boiling over into a confrontation with Mud that shatters the adventurous, paradisal escapism of the island.\n\nOf course, linking biblical or classical ideas to American mythology is far from new. The difference here is that with each movie\u2019s more or less contemporary setting (\u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines\u201d begins in the \u201990s, but ends in current day), it feels as if the traditional imagery \u2014 both American, and further back \u2014 is being deployed as a last-ditch attempt at inflating characters who have stopped making sense. These are broken archetypes wandering through archetypically desolate landscapes. They are men of the frontier, but also victims to it.\n\nIn each film, some character embodies a mythic vision of American masculinity. These characters are almost always shown either as out of step with the world around them, or as reflecting ways of life that are dying. They never triumph in an uncomplicated way. Just as the plots of these movies nod to biblical motifs, the characters themselves often take elements of stock fictional depictions of rugged masculinity. Mud is an island man as Rodney (or, on the darker side, Harlan) is a mountain man, as Luke is classical outlaw, a bank robber.\n\nOf all of these, it\u2019s Mud who\u2019s most romanticized. He first appears as something of an apparition, the boys noticing cross-marks in the sand from his boots. They turn around and he\u2019s standing by the tide \u2014 appearing out of nowhere, out of nature. He presents himself as an American mystic living out in the swamp, but also sounds like a rambling Beat. The crosses are nails meant to \u201cward off evil spirits.\u201d As Ellis talks to both Mud and Tom Blankenship, the men mythologize one another. According to Mud, Tom is an ex-CIA assassin living a quiet, monkish second life in a houseboat; Tom claims Mud was \u201cliving in the woods when I first met him.\u201d It\u2019s unclear whether anything the men say about each other is actually true, but all of it paints Mud as a romantic outlaw.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For the guys in a spate of recent movies, trying to be a tough, rugged outlaw doesn't work out very well", "title": "Masculinity anxiety at the movies: Questioning yesterday\u2019s tough guys", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "For the guys in a spate of recent movies, trying to be a tough, rugged outlaw doesn't work out very well", "title": "Masculinity anxiety at the movies: Questioning yesterday\u2019s tough guys", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/20/masculinity_anxiety_at_the_movies_questioning_yesterdays_tough_guys/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/place_beyond_pines1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For the guys in a spate of recent movies, trying to be a tough, rugged outlaw doesn't work out very well", "title": "Masculinity anxiety at the movies: Questioning yesterday\u2019s tough guys", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/place_beyond_pines1.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ryan Leas", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Film, Masculinity, Movies, Mud, out of the furnace, the place beyond the pines", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In each film, some character embodies a mythic vision of American masculinity.\n\u201cAmerican men don\u2019t know how to make things anymore,\u201d and all that.\nCooper, Cianfrance and Nichols also turn to immortal tropes of the past to address a much more contemporary preoccupation with a fading sense of rugged American masculinity.\nFor a certain slice of American men, a romance has cropped up around working the docks, or an oil rig, or a crab boat up around Alaska.\nHe presents himself as an American mystic living out in the swamp, but also sounds like a rambling Beat."}
