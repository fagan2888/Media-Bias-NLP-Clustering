The parents of a 12-year-old Salina girl who died several months after being shocked while playing during a rainstorm say they will appeal a judge's dismissal of their lawsuit against the city.

Jayden Hicks was 11 in May 2013 when she came into contact with the metal cover of an in-ground electrical junction box while playing with friends near a downtown plaza. The box had been installed without a grounding wire and contained damaged wires.

Jayden underwent months of hospitalization and rehabilitation before she died in December of that year.

An attorney for Jayden's parents told the Salina Journal on Friday the family will appeal Judge Bill Elliott's Sept. 23 summary judgment in favor of the city.

The case had been set to go to trial Jan. 18.
