A coworker who knew someone in the group got her in touch with the other moms.\n\nOther people approach Mary Jo Andrews after she speaks at events about mental illness. \u201cAre you taking new people in your group?\u201d they ask. She tries to make sure they\u2019d fit, that they\u2019re not dealing with \u201cnormal teenage stuff.\u201d\n\nThis group is for moms whose children have serious mental illness.\n\nIt\u2019s a group of people who understand what it\u2019s like to sit outside a child\u2019s bedroom at night, listening to make sure she doesn\u2019t hang herself or wondering whether the fact that he didn\u2019t audibly roll over in a while means he found some pills somewhere and is in a coma.\n\nThe moms try to get from each other what they say is almost impossible to find elsewhere: Help figuring out the right services for a teenager at risk of suicide; recommendations for good child and adolescent psychiatrists who take both insurance and new patients; tips for getting insurance approval for a kid to spend another day in a psychiatric hospital; guidance navigating mental health, medical, insurance and school systems that don\u2019t seem to coordinate with each other and often seem insurmountable to families in crisis.\n\nThe group began as a handful of moms from the Farmington Valley, meeting once a month for dinner. Then the Newtown shootings happened, and the mothers felt they needed to do more. They spoke to legislators. They shared their families\u2019 struggles publicly. Some appeared on 60 Minutes.\n\nSince then, the group has tripled in size, with parents from as far as Burlington, Glastonbury, Hamden, Manchester and Bristol.\n\n\u201cThat group just keeps growing and growing, which just shows you this huge untapped need out there,\u201d said Nancy Aker, one of the moms.\n\nTheir experiences have given them a perspective on the state\u2019s mental health system and on the unmet needs. And they\u2019ve gained a voice at a time when state officials are looking for ways to better address mental health.\n\nArielle Levin Becker / The CT Mirror\n\nAker, Andrews and a handful of other mothers in the group have developed a set of recommendations. They\u2019re hoping to influence the plan being developed by the state Department of Children and Families for meeting the mental, emotional and behavioral health needs of all children in the state -- a plan required as part of legislation passed in the wake of the Newtown shootings.\n\nAmong their recommendations: Change how private insurance handles mental health coverage. Help teachers better respond to students with mental health needs. Expand the use of behavioral health screening in routine physical exams to identify kids' needs early, when problems can more easily be addressed. Develop an office to review research on mental health research and programs, with the goal of making new treatments available as soon as possible. Create a clearinghouse to help people find information so they don\u2019t have to rely on word of mouth.\n\nSome are likely to be controversial. Andrews worries that most of the items will cost money and wonders where it will come from.\n\nBut she and others note that there are also costs from changing nothing, like the costs of young people growing up without the care they need and ending up in the public mental health system, on disability, homeless or in prison.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just raising a generation of kids that have not been able to reach their potential,\u201d said Carol Poehnert, one of the mothers who worked on the recommendations.\n\nAnd there are costs to families. To pay for her 18-year-old daughter\u2019s residential treatment, Andrews and her husband tapped the equity out of their house, drained their daughter\u2019s college savings, borrowed from family and took the maximum loan against her 401k.\n\nOne woman in the group who has private health insurance spent so much out-of-pocket on her child\u2019s care last year that her unreimbursed medical expenses exceeded her gross income.\n\nHere are some of The Moms\u2019 Mental Health Advocacy Group\u2019s recommendations, and the stories behind them. (For the full list, click here.)\n\nSomewhere to turn for help\n\nThe mothers said most of what they learned about the types of services available, and how to access them, has been through the moms\u2019 group.\n\nArielle Levin Becker / The CT Mirror\n\n\u201cThis is not information that should be spread haphazardly by word of mouth,\u201d they wrote in their recommendations, detailed in a letter to the legislative co-chairwomen of the Committee on Children.\n\nEven clinicians often don\u2019t know the range of resources that could help a family, they wrote.\n\nThe mothers suggested that there should be a comprehensive clearinghouse for information on resources available to help people dealing with mental health issues, and recommended that it include feedback on providers and programs.\n\nPart of their suggestion is being implemented. A law passed this year requires the state Office of the Healthcare Advocate to create an information and referral service to provide information about behavioral health care, referrals and access to providers.\n\nBut the mothers said having a resource isn\u2019t enough. Instead, they said, there should be a care coordinator assigned to each family with a child with severe mental illness.\n\n\u201cBelieve us -- a parent whose child is suicidal or otherwise severely mentally ill is in no shape to successfully navigate even the most user-friendly clearinghouse,\u201d they wrote.\n\nStigma and schools\n\nHaving a severely ill child is hard, but the moms say there\u2019s an added challenge when the illness is stigmatized, when people don\u2019t understand it, or view its manifestations as behavioral choices, not symptoms. Stigma keeps people from seeking care they need and keeps families from seeking support, even from relatives, they say.\n\nThey say school personnel don't always understand mental illness and can handle situations poorly, like asking a student in class, \"Did you forget your meds today?\"\n\n\u201cFor children who are seen by teachers and students as \u2018different,\u2019 bullying becomes commonplace,\u201d the moms wrote.\n\nArielle Levin Becker / The CT Mirror\n\nBeverley Brakeman, who helped write the recommendations, sees stigma in the way her 14-year-old daughter covers her arms, which are scarred from cutting herself. Her daughter would be shunned and embarrassed if people saw, she said.\n\nIf she had cancer and lost her hair from chemotherapy, people would rally around her, maybe even run a 5k in her name, Brakeman said. She wishes the same could be true of her daughter\u2019s sickness.\n\nMany of the mothers\u2019 recommendations related to stigma involve education. They suggested that training on mental illness for teachers and other school personnel include information on stigma, possibly from a parent of a child with mental illness or a teen or young adult who has dealt with mental illness.\n\nThey also recommended having school health classes include units on mental illness and stigma, to give students an understanding of what mental illness is -- and isn\u2019t. State law requires school health classes to cover mental and emotional health, but doesn\u2019t specify stigma or mental illness.\n\nIn addition, they suggested that teachers who have multiple students with special needs should have significantly smaller classroom sizes or additional support, based on the degree of the students\u2019 needs. They suggested that the state bear the cost, rather than individual school districts.\n\nInsurance and access to care\n\nMany of the mothers said their private insurance coverage has posed barriers to getting care. They cited health plans that provide limited or no coverage for certain care, such as intensive outpatient programs or in-home services. In other cases, they say, the scrutiny their children\u2019s clinicians go through to justify keeping a kid inpatient for another day can be significant. They described one case in which a child was actively suicidal but sent home two days later when the insurance company deemed inpatient care not medically necessary.\n\nArielle Levin Becker / The CT Mirror\n\nIn part, the mothers see stigma: The same type of treatment limits wouldn\u2019t be tolerated if applied to children with cancer or diabetes, they say.\n\nBut they also note that there are differences between mental illness and physical conditions.\n\n\u201cThere is no x-ray or blood test for most mental illnesses,\u201d they wrote.\n\nBecause there is subjectivity in the treatment of mental illness, they said, it makes the most sense for insurance companies to rely on the treatment plan developed by each child\u2019s mental health providers.\n\nKeith Stover, a lobbyist for the Connecticut Association of Health Plans, used a similar analogy in describing the challenges of determining how to cover mental health services, noting that there\u2019s rarely a clear diagnostic test that leads to an exact treatment protocol.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really a big part of the difficulty,\u201d he said. \u201cI really think it\u2019s important to say that the difficulty is not around whether to treat or lack of desire to get the member into the right treatment, because frankly, from a purely pecuniary perspective, it is always in the payer\u2019s interest to find the right thing as quickly as possible and get the thing treated.\u201d\n\nBut Stover said it\u2019s important for insurers to be sure they\u2019re paying for treatments that have been demonstrated to work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not in our interest to have someone in an inpatient setting when they would be flourishing or getting better more quickly in an outpatient setting,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also not in our interest, or the member\u2019s interest, to have courses of treatment which aren\u2019t adequately peer-reviewed and evidence-based.\u201d\n\nStover said the insurance industry has been working, particularly in recent years, on addressing access to mental health services in a timely manner, including through changes made in legislation passed after the Newtown shootings.\n\nIn the past, officials at the Connecticut Insurance Department have said that some problems people face getting mental health services covered were the result of issues in the claims process, such as incomplete information, rather than insurance companies skirting coverage rules. They noted that because many mental health providers don't accept insurance, families often submit claims themselves and might not have the expertise to ensure they're accepted the first time. The department has released a toolkit to help people filing claims.\n\nThe mothers\u2019 group\u2019s other recommendations include:\n\nRequiring insurance carriers to work with mental health professionals to create a list of services needed to adequately treat children and require that carriers cover them.\n\nChanging the criteria used to determine coverage of mental health services to provide a higher level of deference to the recommendations of a child\u2019s treatment team and put the burden on the insurer to defend a decision to deny treatment recommended by the patient\u2019s clinicians.\n\nHaving the state create incentives to encourage mental health providers to accept insurance. The group suggested school loan forgiveness or tax incentives as possible options.\n\nThe state child welfare agency\n\nSome families that have private health insurance turn to the state Department of Children and Families for help accessing services they might not otherwise be able to get. The program is known as voluntary services and is available to families even if they\u2019re not involved in the child welfare system.\n\nBut some who have tried to access services through the agency say it\u2019s been difficult, particularly in recent years. They say they\u2019re particularly concerned about Commissioner Joette Katz\u2019s push to dramatically reduce the placement of youth in residential treatment and out-of-state facilities.\n\nDCF spokesman Gary Kleeblatt said the department\u2019s efforts are in line with a national move toward providing services in children\u2019s homes or in community settings, rather than in residential treatment facilities or group homes. While there will always be a need for some kids to receive more intense services during acute situations, Kleeblatt said the key strategy must be early identification and intervention.\n\n\u201cFamilies want their kids to be successful at home and in the community, and that\u2019s where we need to provide the services,\u201d he said.\n\nBut while the need for residential care is rare, members of the mothers\u2019 group say it should be easier to access when needed.\n\nAndrews said her family has seen a change at DCF. When her daughter was hospitalized six years ago, at age 12, her clinicians recommended getting in touch with DCF because there were certain services that were only available through the agency.\n\n\u201cIt felt like a partnership,\u201d Andrews said.\n\nThey met with a social worker who reviewed their daughter\u2019s case. They ultimately decided she didn\u2019t need voluntary services, but the social worker checked in periodically to ask how they were doing. Eventually, she told the family it seemed like they had all the services they needed in place, and asked how they would feel about closing the file. Andrews agreed.\n\nFour years later, Andrews\u2019 daughter was spiraling downward, far worse than she\u2019d been before. She was already in a clinical day school, had a private psychiatrist and private therapist, and many community-based services, and her clinicians believed she needed residential treatment.\n\nBut DCF wouldn\u2019t open a voluntary services file for her daughter, Andrews said. She said she was told that the agency wouldn\u2019t do so unless it thought there were services that it could offer the family.\n\n\u201cIt was completely adversarial,\u201d she said.\n\nUltimately, Andrews\u2019 family hired an educational consultant to help find an appropriate placement. Some facilities in Connecticut said they didn't think they had the intense therapeutic care Andrews' daughter needed. She ultimately went to a treatment program out of state that, her mother said, \u201cchanged her life.\u201d\n\nThe mothers recommended that DCF have more flexibility in serving families through voluntary services and begin with the recommendations of a child\u2019s care team, rather than a bias against residential care.\n\n\u201cThere clearly has been a change in the overall shape of the system,\u201d Kleeblatt said, noting that the system relies less on group care settings and has built more community-based services.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot more work to do. We recognize that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know we need to do that work with families.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/07/24/moms-of-children-with-mental-illness-share-their-pain-tell-their-stories-push-for-change/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Department of Children and Families, insurance, Joette Katz, mental health, The Moms\u2019 Mental Health Advocacy Group", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2014/07/24/moms-of-children-with-mental-illness-share-their-pain-tell-their-stories-push-for-change/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Their informal network helps them to get from each other what they say is almost impossible to find elsewhere, like help figuring out the right services for a teenager at risk of suicide.
