Montefiore Health System this week rolled out a new branding slogan it hopes will draw attention to the system's legacy in the metro New York area.

Montefiore advertising will now feature the slogan, "Doing More," which it created with the help of advertising agency The Bloc.

"Montefiore's 'Doing More' campaign celebrates the art and science of achieving remarkable outcomes for our patients and our communities," system CEO Steven M. Safyer said in a statement. "It expresses our unique relationship with Albert Einstein College of Medicine. It is why we have a history of firsts. Our health system's northward expansion provided the perfect opportunity to share this story and how this expert care can be delivered with warmth, closer to people's' homes."

The campaign, which includes advertising on TV, radio, print, social media and outdoor signage, hopes to highlight the system's expansion into Westchester County, the greater Hudson Valley and the Bronx.

In September 2015, Montefiore took over control of the Albert Einstein School of Medicine after running it jointly with Yeshiva University for years.

Montefiore is not the only New York system focusing on branding in that competitive urban market. Northwell Health, which in January changed its name from the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, is currently running a multimillion-dollar campaign tied to the name change.

Its new slogan, "Look North," is being featured in a host of ads, including one commercial that ran during the Super Bowl.
