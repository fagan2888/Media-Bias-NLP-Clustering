I refer to it as the \u201cOpen Letter\u201d fad, wherein an epistolary blog post is written to Miley (or teen girls in general), warning young women all over the world about the dangers of tush-shaking and back-arching and acting like the sexpots that minivan moms generally are not.\n\nWhat started as a seemingly earnest attempt to caution the younger generation about how to conduct and dress oneself has turned into a holier-than-thou slutshaming trend\u2014a craze that\u2019s starting to stink an awful lot like an attempt to generate blog traffic (at best) and women ganging up on women (at worst).\n\nWell, gather round, ho-bags and hussies and floozies and strumpets and garden-variety sluts, because this minivan-driving 40-year-old mother of two boys who sometimes wears Crocs with capri pants has an open letter for you, too. It goes:\n\nDear Teen Girls,\n\nDo you babysit?\n\nSincerely,\n\nWhitney\n\nBecause honestly? That\u2019s really all I want to know (and am privy to know) about girls between the ages of 12 and 21 these days. Do you have childcare experience? Do you know basic First Aid? Can you drive yourself to my house? And what do you charge? Not for handjobs or underage beer runs or stolen class notes. What do you charge per child, per hour, and can you keep my sons alive while I go to Target alone? Can you, Mikaylah, keep my kids from mortal wounds while I go buy detergent all by my goddamn self?\n\nWho am I, someone who is not your mother, to tell you what length your skirt should be? While I\u2019m sure it\u2019s very effective to receive fashion advice and sexual tips from a stranger who shops at Ann Taylor Loft and whose ass resembles a Trapper Keeper (I know you don\u2019t know what that is), I\u2019m going to refrain from too much unsolicited advice here.\n\nExcept for:\n\nPeople are going to tell you that reputations can never be recovered and that regrets of the sexual kind are permanent and that the only people that people remember from high school and college are the loose girls.\n\nWell, rest assured young ladies of the night: people also remember assholes and freaks and the guy who fell off the back of the bleachers drunk and the teacher who always had toilet paper coming out the back of his pants and the girl with the funny laugh and the fellow who played a mean bass and the wallflower who had an amazing singing voice and the math whiz and the boy who always brought an onion sandwich to lunch and the sweet young thang who may or may not have been a little easy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An open letter to slut-shaming open letter writers: Spare us your fashion advice and sanctimonious sex tips", "title": "Please, make the open letters to Miley Cyrus stop", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "An open letter to slut-shaming open letter writers: Spare us your fashion advice and sanctimonious sex tips", "title": "Please, make the open letters to Miley Cyrus stop", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/10/please_make_the_open_letters_to_miley_cyrus_stop_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/miley_cyrus3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An open letter to slut-shaming open letter writers: Spare us your fashion advice and sanctimonious sex tips", "title": "Please, make the open letters to Miley Cyrus stop", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/miley_cyrus3.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Whitney Collins", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Miley Cyrus, Sex, Slut shaming, Teenagers, The Weeklings", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s really all I want to know (and am privy to know) about girls between the ages of 12 and 21 these days.\nWho am I, someone who is not your mother, to tell you what length your skirt should be?\nCan you, Mikaylah, keep my kids from mortal wounds while I go buy detergent all by my goddamn self?\nWhat do you charge per child, per hour, and can you keep my sons alive while I go to Target alone?\nI refer to it as the \u201cOpen Letter\u201d fad, wherein an epistolary blog post is written to Miley (or teen girls in general), warning young women all over the world about the dangers of tush-shaking and back-arching and acting like the sexpots that minivan moms generally are not."}
