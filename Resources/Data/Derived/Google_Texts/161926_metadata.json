He applied for, and received, disability benefits from the state of California, receiving $51,000 from September 2010 through September 2011.\n\nYet during that same period, while taking the cash, he was also performing as a dancer \u2013 but the dancing hamster gig was only part of this wild \u201ctail\u201d: Barnes performed as a backup dancer for Madonna, Chris Brown and other celebrities during that time; performed under an alias in a rap group, The Rej3ctz; and contributed to the recording of The Rej3ctz\u2019s 2011 song, \u201cCat Daddy.\u201d (Chris Brown was the featured dancer on the video, which as of June 8, 2014 had nearly 14 million YouTube views.)\n\nBarnes was arrested by the LAPD last month, charged with disability fraud and released on $50,000 bail. \u201cFraudulently collecting disability benefits is not only illegal, it disrespects legitimately injured Californians who are unable to work,\u201d state Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones told CBS. It\u2019s unclear if Barnes has denied the allegations.\n\nIf convicted, he\u2019ll likely owe restitution to the tune of nearly $75,000, plus need to spend nearly six years in jail, reported ABC News \u2013 which also noted Barnes is hardly \u201cthe first to be accused of claiming disability after appearing on TV\u201d:\n\nCathy Cashwell pleaded guilty last year to fraud after claiming workers\u2019 compensation and then appearing on \u201cThe Price Is Right.\u201d In her 2004 claim, Cashwell, of Oak Island, N.C., said a shoulder injury while working as a postal worker had prevented her from standing, running, reaching or grasping. But she was spotted on the show running up to the podium, jumping in excitement and spinning the wheel. She also posted all her vacation photos online and was seen zip-lining and hang-gliding on Facebook.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It's the latest form of performance art \u2013 dancing in a TV commercial while collecting", "title": "Outrageous!
