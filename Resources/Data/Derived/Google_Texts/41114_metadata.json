The Romans crucified the apostle Paul, because he served another king other than Caesar. In many countries, the state is tied to some false religious system and thus at odds with the followers of Jesus Christ. In the book of the Revelation of John, we find the state at war with the followers of Christ. In fact, Revelation 11:15 says, \u201cThen the seventh angel blew his trumpet and there were loud voices saying \u2018The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever.\u2019\u201d It always comes down to this. In his City of God, Augustine points to the fact that either you are worshipping the true God, and serving His kingdom or you are worshipping at the altar of some false god and serving the kingdom of man.\n\nToday, in America, we find this situation being played out in the left\u2019s war with Christianity. The leftists are the Marxist, progressivist, liberals in the Democratic Party. In opposition to the leftists are the traditional conservatives. You will note, that I did not say the Republican Party. Unfortunately, the Republican politicians are not always conservative. While not every Democrat is an atheist, they vote in lock step with their party, which makes them practicing atheists. Make no mistake about it, the Democratic Party leadership is at war with Christianity. You will recall, that last year the Democratic Party voted God off of their platform. Why would this be? According to John 15: 18 \u201cIf the world hates you, know that it hated me before it hayed you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.\u201d\n\nBiblical Christianity results in all sorts of liberty, because as John 8:32 says \u201cand you will know the truth and the truth will set you free.\u201d This freedom includes, among other things, religious, political, and economic liberty. To make all of this work in the right way requires that society have a strong moral base. In other words, for a society to be free, it must be virtuous. Consequently, biblical Christianity results in moral restrictions. These moral restrictions are actually guardrails, that protect the individual, the family and society as a whole. The Church as the kingdom of God acts as salt and light to preserve a healthy society. What is most amazing is that these leftists, who benefitted from all of the blessings of our society, which is based on a Judeo- Christian worldview, want to destroy all of the things that caused our nation to be successful. The leftists want a \u201cbrave new world,\u201d that they believe will be superior to ours. They believe that they are like Nietzsche\u2019s \u201csuperman,\u201d who stands above the \u201cpetty moralic acid of the weak.\u201d\n\nThe leftists realize that the Church of Jesus Christ is the main obstacle to their \u201cutopia.\u201d In other woirds, the kingdom of God stands in opposition to the kingdom of man. To accomplish their goals, the leftists have a many- pronged attack. The National Educational Association is driven by Marxist ideology and does everything it can to change the values of the average student. Worse, their system privileges the teacher with tenure, minimizes the rights of the parents and makes sure that the student gets a poor education. Another prong of this attack comes from the homosexual lobby, which wants to not only make homosexuality acceptable, but to give it a privileged status. The environmental lobby does their part by providing pseudo- science and legislation that reduces economic liberty. Then there are the various groups who want not only a separate state and church (as if that was in the U.S. Constitution), but they want to keep Christianity (not Islam or other religions) out of the public square. Consequently, the leftists offer us freedom of worship, rather than freedom of religion. Finally, the leftist media works constantly to make the Democratic Party appear virtuous and those on the right look like a stupid and vicious rabble. They want to take our freedom of speech, our right to bear arms and anything else that gets in the government\u2019s way of controlling the people, rather than serving them.\n\nThe leftists attack conservatives by saying that we are racists, anti- scientific and anti- knowledge. They argue that conservative Christians are stupid, narrow- minded and homophobes. They want us to embrace and affirm their \u201cso- called freedom,\u201d which only offers enslavement, instead. The leftists believe that rather than worshipping our God, we should worship theirs. So who is their god? It appears that they worship the state, but they actually worship Satan. He has spiritually blinded them so that what is right appears to be wrong to them. 2 Corinthians 10: 3+4 says \u201cFor though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds. We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every though captive to obey Christ.\u201d Jesus Christ came to free us from the ruler of this world (John 12:31-2) Let there be no mistake, we are engaged in spiritual warfare. We cannot win by the force of our arguments alone, but only by the love of Jesus Christ. God\u2019s work must be done in God\u2019s way, and in His power. To be sure, plenty will not like what I am writing. So, in response, I offer Galatians 4:16, which asks the question \u201cHave I then become your enemy by telling you the truth?\u201d\n\nObamacare is now being forced upon us and with it they will invade every aspect of our lives. As if the NSA, IRS and other agencies spying on us were not enough. Many people do not see a problem with these things, because they have lulled themselves into complacency. It is time for people to wake up, before it is too late. It has been said that a liberal is a conservative who hasn\u2019t been mugged yet. Well get ready to hand over your wallet and your freedom, because here comes the mugging. People who think that Obamacare was a good idea will soon be disabused of that notion. Unfortunately, our politicians and their staffs will be insulated from its affects, so some of them will not be in any hurry to repeal it.\n\nOur choice is always between two gods and two kingdoms. In John 10:10 we read, \u201cThe thief comes only to steal, kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.\u201d The mugging that Obamacare will bring is consistent with the kind of ruler Satan is. The abundant life of freedom with justice and righteousness is consistent with the kind of ruler that we have in Jesus Christ.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Romans crucified Jesus Christ because He was a King.
