That's the Malaysian currency's weakest against the greenback since late 1997, when the dollar at one point fetched as much as 4.88 ringgit.\n\n\"There remains significant downside risk even after the sharp ringgit correction,\" Hak Bin Chua, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in Singapore, said in a note Wednesday, noting that he sees little comfort from claims Malaysia is much stronger than in 1997, when it took a wallop from the Asian Financial Crisis (AFC).\n\nRead More Timeline: The twists and turns in the tale of 1MDB\n\n\"Some leverage indicators are much higher than in 1997, including household, public and external debt,\" Chua noted, citing data showing household debt as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) is almost double at 86 percent, compared with 1997's level of 46 percent. He noted public debt as a percentage of GDP is also significantly higher at 54 percent, up from 31 percent in 1997.\n\n\"The ringgit depreciation has not strengthened exports or improved the trade balance at all,\" he said, adding he also expects foreign investors will begin unwinding their holdings of Malaysian government bonds once the Federal Reserve begins increasing interest rates, expected later this year.
