The Maryland Health Connection launched on Oct. 1, 2013 to a rocky start. Despite the problems, however, the state almost doubled its enrollment goal of 260,000, signing up 458,000 people: 81,553 in private health plans and another 376,850 in Medicaid, according to its annual report. After a new system was installed, enrollment further skyrocketed and more than 700,000 Marylanders signed up for coverage through the exchange in 2015, Quattrocki said.\n\nIn fact, according to a Gallup-Healthways poll, the rate of the uninsured in Maryland went from 12.9 percent in 2013 to about 7 percent in mid-2015.\n\nAccording to a study by The Commonwealth Fund, in 2013, the year before the ACA\u2019s major coverage expansions took effect, more than one of five Blacks ages 18 to 64 (22 percent) and one of three Hispanics (33 percent) did not have health insurance, compared with one of seven Whites (14 percent).\n\nThose abysmal rates have been decreased, particularly in states like Maryland that have expanded Medicaid. However, much still needs to be done. For example, last year, only 23,000 out of a possible 120,000 self-identified African-American Marylanders (18 percent) enrolled into private insurance plans, Quattrocki said.\n\nThat\u2019s why the MHBE is putting much more emphasis on information sharing in their 2016 enrollment campaign.\n\n\u201cWe have definitely put more emphasis on outreach in the community. [And] we\u2019ve doubled our social media this year,\u201d said Andrew Ratner, director of Marketing and Strategic Initiatives, MHBE.\n\nAs such, the agency\u2019s print advertising buy has been decreased from $1.7 million to $1 million. And their advertising will be much more targeted, including the use of media outlets with large Black and Hispanic audiences, Ratner said.\n\n\u201cOur TV and radio advertising is highly structured around the areas that have the most remaining uninsured in Maryland,\u201d he said, mentioning Prince George\u2019s County and the Eastern Shore, specifically. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll also supplement with radio and print advertising statewide.\u201d\n\nBut, much of their efforts will be in making direct connections with the community, through involvement in local events, partnerships with local organizations\u2014such as the NAACP, the Maryland Citizens\u2019 Health Initiative, Black Greek organizations, etc.; and partnerships with colleges and community influencers to help motivate people to enroll, Quattrocki said.\n\nFor example, Meredith Huston, who writes the blog \u201cThe Empowered Mocha Patient,\u201d will attend an enrollment event in Baltimore on Dec. 13 to promote open enrollment. She\u2019ll host a live video stream and Q&A session with a navigator at the event and do social media promotion.\n\nPerhaps, the most important effort, however\u2014particularly in the Black community\u2014will be the agency\u2019s engagement with churches. The MHBE is organizing a \u201cSuper Health Sunday\u201d scheduled for Jan. 24 with several predominantly Black churches, where navigators will be on site to assist consumers just prior to the end of open enrollment season. Also, United Baptist Church on Eager Street in Baltimore is hosting a navigator to enroll members on Dec. 6 and also plans to host \u201cSuper Health Sunday.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur goal is to make sure everyone in Maryland who is eligible for insurance gets it,\u201d DeMarco said, \u201cand the best way is working through the faith community.\u201d\n\nMaryland residents interested in enrolling in a health insurance plan for 2016 can do so by getting free in-person help, by attending an enrollment event, by calling 855-642-8572 or by visiting the Maryland Health Connection website.
