The campaign coincides with November\u2019s National Family Caregivers Month.\n\nAs a caregiver, I\u2019m especially happy to be a part of this effort. I recently appeared on NBC\u2019s Today show, and you can look for me on The Doctors this month as well as on other national and local television programs. Many AARP state offices are organizing events, and I\u2019ll be speaking at several of them.\n\nOrganize and privately share crucial info with family and caregivers \u2014 Download AARP\u2019s Caregiving App \u00bb\n\nHere are some of the caregiver-focused activities AARP has underway.\n\nTelling caregivers\u2019 stories:\n\nAARP The Magazine has a moving photo essay, A Day in the Life of an American Caregiver , which depicts caregivers across the nation during a typical day. My friend Peter Rosenberger and his wife are profiled, and I can attest that Peter is an awesome caregiver! Check out the video that goes along with the story.\n\n, which depicts caregivers across the nation during a typical day. My friend Peter Rosenberger and his wife are profiled, and I can attest that Peter is an awesome caregiver! Check out the video that goes along with the story. AARP Bulletin profiled some of those same caregivers more extensively in its November story \u201cThe New Faces of Caregiving,\u201d which discussed the many and varied challenges facing millennial and sandwich-generation caregivers, caregivers of veterans and dementia patients, and more.\n\nAARP\u2019s I Heart Caregivers storytelling campaign has created Portraits of Care, to honor and recognize family caregivers across the nation. AARP has randomly selected from each of the 53 U.S. states and territories one caregiver who submitted his or her story and photo to I Heart Caregivers. Those chosen receive a beautiful portrait of themselves and the loved ones they tend to, each pair painted by a different artist.\n\n\n\nOffering new resources and support:\n\nAARP is holding its first free Virtual Caregiving Fair on Nov. 19. Whether you\u2019re new to family caregiving or have been providing care for a long time, there will be something for everyone. It\u2019s easy to attend: Just register online or call 877-926-8300, toll-free, and log on between noon and 4 p.m. ET to view presentations and videos in the virtual auditorium or to connect with exhibitors such as Veterans Affairs and Social Security in the exhibit hall. Also, I\u2019ll be hosting the Mix and Mingle Lounge all afternoon, where you can participate in group discussions and scheduled chats with me and other experts and \u2014 most important \u2014 other caregivers. There will also be a library with great resources. Check out the list of scheduled sessions and participating organizations.\n\nWhether you\u2019re new to family caregiving or have been providing care for a long time, there will be something for everyone.

My new book, AARP\u2019s Juggling Life, Work and Caregiving, is out this month and contains practical tools and tips for caregivers. It\u2019s based on my 30-plus years of professional experience and my ongoing personal caregiving journey. It covers everything from getting organized to caring for you, the caregiver; to health, legal and financial issues; to grief and loss; and even life after caregiving. I hope you\u2019ll find it helpful.\n\nEncouraging acts of kindness for caregivers:\n\nI can personally tell you that even small acts of kindness can make a huge difference in a caregiver\u2019s life. In one of my recent blog posts, I tell a story of unexpected kindness shown to me that completely changed my outlook. To foster more support for family caregivers, AARP has launched the Random Acts of Kindness for Caregivers Contest, which encourages people to help the unpaid caregivers in their lives as well as those they see in the community. Submit your photos, videos and stories at www.aarp.org/caregiverkindness and share on social media using #BeKindToCaregivers. You can submit once a week, and when the contest ends in March, AARP will select 12 people who\u2019ve made a meaningful difference in a caregiver\u2019s life to split a $10,000 cash prize. I hope this effort shows people the many ways they can help lighten our load.\n\nGet discounts on prescriptions, health exams, eye care and more \u2014 AARP Member Advantages \u00bb\n\nAmy Goyer is AARP\u2019s family, caregiving and multigenerational issues expert; she spends most of her time in Phoenix, where she is caregiving for her dad, who lives with her.
