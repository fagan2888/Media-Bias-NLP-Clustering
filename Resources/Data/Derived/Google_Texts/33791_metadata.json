So far, 354,000 have selected a plan, but Lee said he wasn\u2019t discouraged. While all the additional outreach into the Latino, African-American and Asian communities appeared to be working, Lee agreed the tax penalties for those who choose to remain uninsured will be a big incentive. \u201cTax season is now about health care,\u201d he said. \u201cIt matters to your pocket. This time, instead of paying for health care, you\u2019ll be writing a check to the IRS.\u201d\n\nBut Lee also said that Covered California board members will be looking into providing a special enrollment period for those who didn\u2019t know there was a penalty.\n\nThe penalty for remaining uninsured in 2014 is $95 per adult and $47.50 per child, with a family maximum of $285, or 1 percent of the annual household income, whichever is greater.\n\nMeanwhile, of the 1.2 million Californians who enrolled in a health plan through Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance market exchange, 800,000 received federal subsidies to help them pay for their coverage. Covered California officials estimated that federal money paid out an average of $5,200 per household per year, or about $436 per month.\n\nBut some people may have to pay some of those subsidies back. Those who received the 1095-A forms to file federal tax returns this year will learn if what they received was appropriate.\n\nFarah Sosa, a Los Angeles resident who spoke at the rally on behalf of Covered California, said having health coverage for the first time last year helped her avoid paying what would have likely been a hefty hospital bill after she was admitted to the emergency department with chest pains.\n\nThe 35-year-old woman who works as a freelance photographer in the Los Angeles music scene said if she owes the feds money for subsidies she received, it would likely be cheaper than a hospital bill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven if I owe taxes, it\u2019s worth it,\u201d she said. \u201cI used my health plan.\u201d\n\nCovered California representatives and certified enrollment agents will be available to help today from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. at the Panorama Mall, 8401 Van Nuys Blvd., Panorama City.\n\nThose who would like to enroll must bring the following:\n\n\u2022 Proof of current income and employer information on all family members who wish to apply (tax return, W-2, recent pay stubs, etc.).\n\n\u2022 Social Security numbers for U.S. citizens, or document information for immigrants with satisfactory status. Families that include undocumented immigrants can apply. Parents can apply for their child even if a parent isn\u2019t eligible for coverage.\n\n\u2022 Federal tax information.\n\n\u2022 Date of birth for each family member in the household.\n\nOther enrollment events can be found at CoveredCA.com.
