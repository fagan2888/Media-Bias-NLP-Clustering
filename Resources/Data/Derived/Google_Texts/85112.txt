Hillary Clinton’s new book, “Hard Choices,” shot to the top of the New York Times’ bestsellers list after its release, but it appears as though the paper is ignoring a conservative author’s new effort despite strong sales.

Conservative author Dinesh D'Souza released “America: Imagine a World Without Her” three weeks ago. Sales numbers surpassed many of the hardcovers included on the Times’ list of the nation’s top 25 nonfiction bestsellers, but his book has been excluded from the group.

Book sales numbers that are circulated among publishers before the Times’ list was released showed that Mr. D’Souza’s work sold 4,915 in the first week and 5,592 copies in the second week, The Washington Examiner reported Friday. Assuming those numbers are accurate, Mr. D'Souza’s book would then rank number 8 on the upcoming June 22 list, and number 11 on the June 29 list.

The Examiner reported that the book has sales numbers are higher than 13 of the books included on the Times’ lists, several of them selling well under 3,000 copies in a week.

A spokeswoman from the Times’ said “we let the rankings speak for themselves and are confident they are accurate,” the Examiner reported.

Mr. D'Souza targets both Ms. Clinton and President Obama in his new book, which he suspects could be the reason the Times has chosen not to include it on its coveted list.

“They are part of the propaganda arm of the Obama administration,” D'Souza told the Examiner. “It’s their newspaper, and they have a right to rig their list anyway they want, but if they are doing it, people should know,” he added.
