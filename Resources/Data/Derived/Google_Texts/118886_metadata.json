And then it begins: Obamacare, Hillary, gay marriage, Benghazi, the list goes on and on.\n\nDon\u2019t worry \u2014 you\u2019re not alone, and we\u2019re here to help! This year try our 3-step recipe for survival in any conversation with your conservative Uncle (or Aunt, cousin, brother, parent, or in-laws!). Just preheat the conversation, stir in a few facts, then bake until perfection!\n\nStep 1: Preheat the conversation. You can\u2019t just start shouting facts at your conservative Uncle. They\u2019re used to hearing angry, reactionary voices from Rush Limbaugh to Bill O\u2019Reilly. Stay calm, and renew your personal connection. After all, you\u2019re family! Most importantly, do not appear too thoughtful \u2014 conservatives may confuse this for weakness.\n\nStep 2: Stir in the facts. Nothing gives conservatives more power than the myths they cling to. Stirring in the facts once you\u2019ve warmed up the conversation is the most important step in the process. Make sure they are given the truth \u2014 it may take a while to counteract all the bad ingredients they\u2019ve been given by the far right. Here are a few myths they may try to promote, along with facts you can stir in to the conversation:\n\nMYTH: This year\u2019s elections mean conservatives are winning over the country.\n\nFACT: Recent polling shows that Americans believe we should lower the cost of student loans (80%), increase spending on infrastructure (75%), raise the minimum wage (65%), and address climate change (59%).

Bush took similar actions on immigration; President Obama\u2019s decision will keep families together and improve our economy by bringing in millions in tax revenue. [Source: Associated Press/ABC News]\n\nMYTH: The situation in Ferguson had nothing to do with race, it was simply justice being served.\n\nFACT: There is a \u2018staggering disparity\u2019 between the races in our justice system, and the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson is the latest tragic example of that systemic disparity. [Source: USA Today]\n\nMYTH: Obamacare is failing and unpopular.\n\nFACT: Obamacare [The Affordable Care Act] has covered millions of Americans who previously went without insurance, and more than 70% of Americans like their Obamacare plans. [Source: Gallup]\n\nMYTH: Gay Marriage is ruining our families, and the Supreme Court has no place deciding the issue.\n\nFACT: The majority of Americans support same-sex marriage, and agree with the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions approving same-sex marriages. [Source: ABC News]\n\nMYTH: Benghazi is one of the biggest scandals in American history.\n\nFACT: A committee organized and planned by Republicans just debunked the conspiracy theories behind this myth. [Source: CNN]\n\nMYTH: Climate change is a myth, or \u2018the science isn\u2019t settled\u2019 on the issue.\n\nFACT: The scientific community agrees by a 97% margin that climate change is real and man-made [Source: Washington Post]. Major corporations are now planning for climate change, why shouldn\u2019t we work to prevent it? [Source: Boston Globe]\n\nMYTH: Voter ID laws are needed to stop voter fraud and protect our democracy.\n\nFACT: Voter fraud is almost nonexistent, and Voter ID laws are designed to suppress voter turnout among minorities, the elderly, and the young. [Source: Brennan Center for Justice]\n\nStep 3: Bake until appropriately cooked. At this point, your conservative Uncle will be roasting in his own myths and half truths, so forgive him if he\u2019s a bit thrown off. Take your time and be patient, let him fully cook, and patiently explain the error of his ways.\n\nThere\u2019s your simple three step recipe. If all else fails, feel free to send us an email. We\u2019ll be checking ThanksgivingHelp@progressiowa.org and prepared with answers to your questions and fact-check any myths we haven\u2019t covered.\n\nGood luck, and Happy Thanksgiving!\n\nMatt Sinovic\n\nProgress Iowa\n\nP.S.
