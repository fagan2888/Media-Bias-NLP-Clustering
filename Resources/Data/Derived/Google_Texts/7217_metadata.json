He also created a fund to spur investments in health care innovation.\n\nStrong says his first job at Orlando Health will be to listen.\n\n\u201cI think my job as an executive and the executive team\u2019s job is to make sure the people who work in hospitals and in health care have the opportunity and the things they need to make that care happen,\u201d Strong said.\n\nOrlando Health isn\u2019t losing money on operations like it was 2013, but the hospital is losing market share to competitors and a union-building campaign is still ongoing.\n\nBoard Chairman Dianna Morgan says Strong comes from a similar health care market.\n\n\u201cRex is a little smaller as a standalone hospital than is Orlando Health, but they are in a very competitive market, just as we are in a very competitive market,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nStrong begins his new job in April.\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
