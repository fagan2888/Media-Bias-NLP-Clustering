He also earned two Silver Stars for valor. After leaving the military, he volunteered with veterans facing mental health problems, often taking them shooting. He took Routh to the shooting range at the request of the troubled veteran\u2019s mother.\n\nThe case has drawn intense interest, partly because of Kyle\u2019s memoir. The Oscar-nominated film based on the book has grossed nearly $300 million.\n\n___\n\nPERSPECTIVES ON ROUTH\n\nFamily members have said Routh suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq. Defense attorneys say Routh, who was taking anti-psychotic medication, was insane when Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, took the former Marine to a shooting range to provide support and camaraderie. Routh, his lawyers say, believed the men planned to kill him.\n\nBut prosecutors have said that Routh was a troubled drug user who knew right from wrong, even with a history of mental illness.\n\nSome of Routh\u2019s psychiatrists at Green Oaks Hospital, the hospital where he was admitted in September 2012 and in January 2013, are expected to take the witness stand.\n\n___\n\nTHE CRIME\n\nOn February 2, 2013, Kyle, Littlefield and Routh drove to Rough Creek Lodge and Resort, which besides luxury accommodations has a 1,000-yard shooting range. About 5 p.m., a resort employee discovered the bodies. Kyle and Littlefield lay on the ground amid scattered weapons; each had been shot several times. About 45 minutes later, authorities say Routh pulled up to his sister\u2019s Midlothian home in Kyle\u2019s truck and admitted that he had killed Kyle and Littlefield, then drove off.\n\nOn Thursday, prosecutors presented a video in which officers spoke with Routh as he sat in Kyle\u2019s pickup. He refused to leave the vehicle and eventually sped away, with police in pursuit. The video shows that a police vehicle rammed the pickup, which became disabled along the side of the road.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Key issues as \u2018American Sniper\u2019 trial continues in Texas", "title": "Key issues as \u2018American Sniper\u2019 trial continues in Texas", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Key issues as \u2018American Sniper\u2019 trial continues in Texas", "title": "Key issues as \u2018American Sniper\u2019 trial continues in Texas", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/16/key_issues_as_american_sniper_trial_continues_in_texas/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/aptopix-american-sniper-trial.jpeg3-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Key issues as \u2018American Sniper\u2019 trial continues in Texas", "title": "Key issues as \u2018American Sniper\u2019 trial continues in Texas", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/aptopix-american-sniper-trial.jpeg3-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc7a3\"", "article_summary": "___THE CRIMEOn February 2, 2013, Kyle, Littlefield and Routh drove to Rough Creek Lodge and Resort, which besides luxury accommodations has a 1,000-yard shooting range.\nHe took Routh to the shooting range at the request of the troubled veteran\u2019s mother.\nKyle served four tours in Iraq and made more than 300 kills as a sniper for SEAL Team 3, according to his own count.\nAfter leaving the military, he volunteered with veterans facing mental health problems, often taking them shooting.\nOn Thursday, prosecutors presented a video in which officers spoke with Routh as he sat in Kyle\u2019s pickup."}
