In two stories that day, the Times explored issues surrounding Swedish Match\u2019s FDA application to change the warnings on its snus products. As I noted (here), \u201cThe Times and their quoted experts did a major disservice to their audience; they failed to report the simple truth, that mouth cancer risk for Swedish snus is next to nil.\u201d\n\nThe original warning labels that Congress ordered for tobacco product packages in 1986 were factually wrong and fatally misleading to smokers, chewers and dippers. Congress didn\u2019t make the warnings more accurate when it ordered the FDA to regulate tobacco in 2009, it just made them cover more of the package \u2013 an action it didn\u2019t take with cigarettes.\n\nThe Times editorial acknowledged that snus is \u201cis less harmful than smoking tobacco,\u201d but it painted Swedish Match\u2019s application as a marketing ploy. That ignores the critical need to terminate government\u2019s lie about products\u2019 health risks.\n\nThe editors echoed tobacco prohibitionists in denying that snus played a role in the Swedish experience. Said the Times, \u201creduced smoking rates and lower rates of tobacco-related diseases such as lung and oral cancer\u201d in Sweden since the 1970s \u201cis debatable,\u201d attributing the successes to \u201cvarious bans, restrictions and public health campaigns.\u201d The editors failed to consider that the reductions are exclusively seen in men \u2013 who use snus and have the lowest lung cancer rate in Europe \u2013 not in women, who rank fifth in Europe for lung cancer.\n\nThe Times acknowledged that their reporters had \u201ccited independent experts who found that snus is not nearly as lethal as cigarettes,\u201d but it added the qualifier \u201c[snus] is not risk-free either, especially for users who also smoke.\u201d It is patently obvious that smoking is risky for anyone, including snus users. It should also be obvious that a smokeless tobacco can labeled \u201cthis product is not a safe alternative to cigarettes\u201d encourages smokers to stick with their habit.\n\nThe Times editors revisit the discredited gateway theory (\u201cthe danger is that snus might lead some nonsmokers and former smokers to\u2026progress on to cigarette smoking\u201d), but they ignore substantial evidence that this has not happened in Sweden (here) or in the U.S. (here).\n\nSumming up, the Times observes: \u201cabstention would be the safest approach.\u201d That might work in Neverland, but in the U.S., abstention was impossible for the 8 million smokers who died in the 20 years since I first described our government\u2019s warnings as bogus. That is no one\u2019s definition of safe.\n\n[Originally published at Tobacco Truth]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/12/how-dangerous-is-snus-dont-ask-new-york-times-editors/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Swedish-Snus1.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "How Dangerous Is Snus?
