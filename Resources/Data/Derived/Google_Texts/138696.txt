There are two reasons for his new optimism, White House officials and party strategists say. One is that the economy is improving and Americans at least partly credit the president. The second reason is that Obama's job approval rating is on the upswing. Obama's job approval is now 18 points better than George W. Bush's at a comparable point in his presidency, and "the same as [Ronald] Reagan's," White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer told commentator Juan Williams in the Hill newspaper. The latest tracking poll by Gallup and the latest Washington Post-ABC News survey showed the same thing: 50 percent of Americans now approve of Obama's job performance, representing the first time he has achieved a majority since May 2013.

In pragmatic terms, all this means there is more of a chance for a united front by Democrats behind Obama's initiatives in Congress rather than an effort to run away from him. Pfeiffer said Obama's modest surge is due to the effectiveness of his economic policies but also to the GOP being out of touch with Middle America. "The GOP has huge trouble on cultural affinity," Pfeiffer said. "Republican tax policies, opposition to regulating pollution, their effort to repeal Dodd-Frank (financial regulations) â€“ it all favors the rich ... We need to engage them on all that."

Obama appears to have concluded that the Democrats' losses in the midterms were a quirk caused by weak candidates and a failed PR strategy, not any fundamental flaw in his leadership or agenda. He has been emboldened to take a series of unilateral actions, bypassing Congress, on issues ranging from immigration to protecting the environment and normalizing relations with Cuba.
