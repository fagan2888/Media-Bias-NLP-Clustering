And while he ultimately lost the general election, Romney carried the New Hampshire GOP contest by a wide margin.\n\nOn stage Wednesday he stepped into the role of attack dog for Brown, the Republican attempting to oust incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in one of the most competitive Senate races this fall. In his remarks, Romney fired off a round of familiar talking points against Shaheen, accusing the first-term senator of being a rubber stamp for President Obama's agenda.\n\n\"His policies are on the ballot, and the name of those policies are Jeanne Shaheen and that's why she's got to go,\" Romney said on stage.\n\nRomney praised Brown, a former U.S. senator from Massachusetts who was defeated by Elizabeth Warren in 2012, as a strong candidate on the economy and national security.\n\n\"This is the guy who ought to be the next United States senator, and you're going to make him the next United States senator,\" Romney said.\n\nIt marked his second appearance for Brown this year in New Hampshire. The state is familiar territory; aside from winning the primary, Romney has a vacation home there and served as governor of neighboring Massachusetts.\n\nThough he hasn't ruled it out entirely, Romney says he has no plans to run for president again in 2016, resisting a barrage of calls from within the party to make a third bid. Recent polls indicate he would become the automatic frontrunner in the potential GOP field if he considered it.\n\n\"He was right on Russia. He was right on Obamacare. He was right on the economy,\" Brown said, thanking Romney for coming to the event. \"I can tell you, governor, if you were in the White House, the country and the world would seem a whole heck of a lot different. \"\n\nRomney's stop comes just before Shaheen gets a wave of in-person support from the most sought-after Democrats. Former President Bill Clinton will headline a Jefferson Jackson dinner on Thursday, while former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is scheduled to be in the state Nov. 2.\n\nHis visit comes at a crucial point in the contested Senate race. Recent poll shows the two candidates are in a dead heat. As Brown has gained momentum in recent months\u2014and with the Senate hanging in the balance--the race has drawn more money, a bombardment of political ads, and a bigger share of the national spotlight on the 2014 midterms.\n\nWhile Romney has been crisscrossing the country campaigning for candidates this year, it's clear he's still not quite used to being the person introducing others on stage.\n\n\"Would you please welcome the next wife-,\" Romney said, catching himself as the crowd erupted in laughs. \"Excuse me, no, no, the current wife, the current wife of the next United States senator, Gail Brown.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure what to do with that,\" Gail Brown teased as she took the podium.\n\n.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "googlebot": "noarchive", "pubdate": "2014-10-15T22:00:28Z", "title": "Mitt Romney boosts Scott Brown in old stomping grounds - CNN.com", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Mitt Romney returned to familiar turf Wednesday, campaigning for Senate candidate Scott Brown in New Hampshire at the same venue where Romney held a rally two years ago during his last presidential run.", "title": "Mitt Romney boosts Scott Brown in old stomping grounds", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/15/politics/romney-brown-new-hampshire/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140930174405-mitt-romney-file-story-top.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "author": "Ashley Killough, CNN", "robots": "index,follow", "fb": {"page_id": 129343697106537, "app_id": 80401312489}, "source": "CNN", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/15/politics/romney-brown-new-hampshire/index.html"}, "lastmod": "2014-10-15T23:03:50Z", "twitter": {"description": "Mitt Romney returned to familiar turf Wednesday, campaigning for Senate candidate Scott Brown in New Hampshire at the same venue where Romney held a rally two years ago during his last presidential run.", "title": "Mitt Romney boosts Scott Brown in old stomping grounds", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/15/politics/romney-brown-new-hampshire/index.html", "image": {"src": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140930174405-mitt-romney-file-left-tease.jpg"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@cnnpolitics", "id": 13850422}, "site": {"identifier": "@CNN", "id": 759251}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=1024"}, "article_summary": "\"This is the guy who ought to be the next United States senator, and you're going to make him the next United States senator,\" Romney said.\n\"Would you please welcome the next wife-,\" Romney said, catching himself as the crowd erupted in laughs.\n\"Excuse me, no, no, the current wife, the current wife of the next United States senator, Gail Brown.\"\nHudson, New Hampshire (CNN) -- Mitt Romney returned to familiar turf Wednesday, campaigning for Senate candidate Scott Brown in New Hampshire at the same venue where Romney held a rally two years ago during his last presidential run.\nAnd while he ultimately lost the general election, Romney carried the New Hampshire GOP contest by a wide margin."}
