William Barber, president of the North Carolina NAACP, said on the call, borrowing the language of Dr. King's speech in 1963.\n\nBarber said that the movement -- comprised of \"transformative fusion coalitions led by indigenous leadership\" -- would be delivering a letter to the North Carolina General Assembly's leaders asking them to meet and consider how to \"repeal and repent\" for the legislature's actions. More than 900 people were arrested at the state capitol for trespassing after Republicans took the governor's mansion and both chambers of the legislature in 2012. Protesters were reacting to bills blocking Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, reducing unemployment benefits, cutting public education funds, implementing voter identification requirements and restricting abortion access.\n\nBarber said the legislators' response to the letter will determine \"decisions yet to be made\" about potential civil disobedience actions.\n\nCoalitions beyond North Carolina have realized that the movement energizes local activists on a variety of intersectional issues.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Francys Johnson, who serves as president of the Georgia NAACP, said issues of concern included his state's failure to expand Medicaid, as well as new laws allowing allowing residents with permits to carry firearms into a broad array of public places.\n\n\"The Moral Monday movement is stimulated in its ambitions by what we've seen in North Carolina,\" Johnson said on the call. \"We're talking about how to make the next generation of Moral Monday younger, more diverse, more proactive and how to shift the political gravity in this state.\"\n\nBarber, who is careful to avoid specifically targeting Republicans (though he did criticize the tea party and the American Legislative Exchange Council's \"extremism\"), frames the movement in nonpartisan terms.\n\n\"[State legislators] engaging in unconstitutional, immoral actions must be challenged and taken on with a deeper language of what's right and what's wrong,\" he said. Using a morality framework means local coalitions can push state legislatures to adopt more progressive agendas, Barber said. \"If you want to change America, you gotta think states.\"\n\nRelated on HuffPost: Moral Monday Protests Moral Monday Protests\n\n1 of 38 Hundreds of demonstrators organize on Halifax Mall in Raleigh, N.C. prior to an act of civil disobedience opposing the Republican legislature's agenda Monday, June 10, 2013, at the North Carolina State Legislative Building.
