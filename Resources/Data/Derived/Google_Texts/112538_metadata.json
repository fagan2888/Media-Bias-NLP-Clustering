Alarming news that came out of China at the end of the week certainly created new awareness of resistance, but possibly not what the organizers had in mind.\n\nOn Thursday, researchers from several Chinese, British and US universities announced in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases that they have identified a new form of resistance, to the very last-ditch drug colistin\u2014and that it is present in both meat animals and people, probably comes from agricultural use of that drug, can move easily among bacteria, and may already be spreading across borders.\n\nThis is very bad news.\n\nTo understand why, it\u2019s necessary to know a little bit about colistin. It is an old drug: It was first introduced in 1959. It has been on the shelf, without seeing much use, for most of the years since, because it can be toxic to the kidneys. And precisely because it hasn\u2019t been used much, bacteria have not developed much resistance to it. It remains effective.\n\nThat neglect turned out to be very fortunate a few years ago when several different resistance factors\u2014NDM, OXA, KPC\u2014started hopscotching around the globe. All of them made bacteria invulnerable to a group of drugs called carbapenems that had been considered a last line of defense: They were the last drugs that were in common use and were able to take care of complex infections that happen in hospitals, caused by E. coli, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter and similar gut-dwelling organisms. Once those bacteria became resistant to carbapenems (earning them the general name of \u201ccarbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae,\u201d or CREs), colistin was all that was left\u2014and colistin use began rising.\n\n(From around that time: Here\u2019s a great story that Jason Gale of Bloomberg wrote about colistin, and one I wrote for Nature about CREs. A long series of posts I wrote for WIRED about the discovery of NDM and the bitter political fights over its apparent origin in India can be found here. Of note, one of the discoverers of NDM is one of the authors of this new research.)\n\nA thing about colistin, which no one seems to have connected the dots on: Because it is an old drug, it is cheap. And because it is cheap, it is an affordable addition to animal feed for all the uses I\u2019ve talked about before: to make animals put on muscle mass faster, and protect them from the conditions of intensive farming.\n\nWhich, apparently, is how it is being used in China\u2014but not only in China. From the paper:\n\nChina is\u2026 one of the world\u2019s highest users of colistin in agriculture. Driven largely by China, the global demand for colistin in agriculture is expected to reach 11,942 tonnes per annum by the end of 2015 (with associated revenues of $229\u00b75 million), rising to 16,500 tonnes by the year 2021, at an average annual growth rate of 4\u00b775%. Of the top ten largest producers of colistin for veterinary use, one is Indian, one is Danish, and eight are Chinese. Asia (including China) makes up 73\u00b71% of colistin production with 28\u00b77% for export including to Europe.\n\nThe findings reported this week originate in an ongoing project in which the Chinese authors were looking for resistance in the E. coli that reside in the guts of food animals. (It\u2019s encouraging that such a project exists.) They say they first perceived a colistin-resistant E. coli in 2013, in a pig from an intensive farm near Shanghai, and then noted increasing colistin resistance over several years. They expanded their research to include, not just samples from animals as they were slaughtered, but sampling of retail meat from supermarkets and street markets, and testing of samples previously taken from patients in two hospitals. The samples were collected between 2011 and 2014.\n\nHere\u2019s what they found. The gene they discovered, which directs colistin resistance and which they dubbed MCR-1, was present:\n\nin 78 (15 percent) of 523 samples of raw pork and chicken meat\n\nin 166 (21 percent) of 804 pigs in slaughterhouses\n\nand in 16 (1 percent) of 1,322 samples from hospital patients with infections.\n\nThat last is important: The bacteria possessing this resistance were not, as sometimes happens, merely gut bacteria that had acquired the necessary DNA but were hanging out quietly in the intestines and not causing trouble. They are already causing human infections.\n\nAnd, of most concern: The MCR-1 gene that creates this resistance is contained on a plasmid, a small piece of DNA that is not part of a bacteria\u2019s chromosome. Plasmids move freely around the bacterial world, hopping from one bacterium to another; in the past, they have transported resistance DNA between bacterial species, facilitating resistance\u2019s rapid movement around the globe. This gene, the authors predict, will be able to do that as well.\n\nThe rapid dissemination of previous resistance mechanisms (eg, NDM-1) indicates that, with the advent of transmissible colistin resistance, progression of Enterobacteriaceae from extensive drug resistance to pan-drug resistance is inevitable and will ultimately become global.\n\n\u201cPan-drug resistance,\u201d to be clear, means that nothing at all will work\u2014that infections are untreatable by any known compound.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that not every dire superbug prediction comes true. In the early 2000s, physicians were very alarmed when resistance to vancomycin\u2014like colistin, another last-resort antibiotic preserved from the 1950s\u2014moved via a plasmid from Enterococcus into Staphylococcus aureus, or staph. At the time, people were already worried about the better-known form of drug-resistant staph, MRSA; the emergence of VRSA, as it became known, ratcheted worries way up. In the end, though, VRSA turned out not to be much of a threat: In 15 years, there have been only 14 such infections in the United States.\n\nBut what makes MCR, this new colistin resistance, different from VRSA is the role that agriculture seems to be playing in its evolution and dispersal. There are two problems here. First, that thousands to millions of animals are getting the drug, which exponentially expands the opportunities that favor resistance. And second, that projects such as the Chinese one that allowed the new gene to be discovered are rare\u2014so colistin resistance could begin moving, from animals and into people, without being noticed.\n\nAnd, in fact, it may be on the move now. The authors note that, while they were writing up their findings, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory received five submissions of bacterial data that appeared to contain the MCR gene\u2014but not from China; from Malaysia.\n\nWhat will happen next? Unfortunately, we have to wait and see\u2014and hope that systems are built that will perceive this new resistance if it arrives. Meanwhile, I especially appreciate the reaction of Mike the Mad Biologist, who knows a great deal about resistance in his real life and can be counted on to be exasperated and blunt.
