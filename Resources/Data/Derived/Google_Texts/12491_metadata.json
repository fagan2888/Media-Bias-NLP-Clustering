A year into the mandate, 50 percent of these larger small businesses now say employee healthcare is their top challenge, tied with hiring new employees.\n\nIn addition to the number of covered employees increasing in 2016, the costs for employee healthcare have also gone up as businesses face dramatic rate and premium increases passed on by private insurance companies.\n\nSmall businesses want more support from the government\n\nThe employee healthcare challenges faced by U.S. small businesses might be influencing what they think about government support. Half of all respondents said the government does not do enough to support American small businesses. Only 24 percent said they did, and 10 percent didn\u2019t want the government involved.\n\nThe support small businesses seek is not being manifested in the economy. Forty-four percent of them said they have more confidence in the economy than they did 12 months ago, but 25 percent have less, and 30 percent see no change.\n\nSmall businesses favor a Republican presidential win in 2016\n\nThe State of Small Business Report, which surveyed more than 1,110 small business owners and executives, revealed a little optimism with the upcoming 2016 presidential election. Thirty-nine percent of them said a Republican presidential win in 2016 would have a positive impact on small business growth; 34 percent said a Democratic victory would be favorable.\n\nIf a Democrat were to win the White House in 2016, 30 percent of respondents said it would negatively impact their growth while only 22 percent said a GOP win would hurt growth.\n\nAbout Wasp Barcode Technologies\n\nWasp Barcode Technologies is a leading provider of small business productivity systems such as inventory control, time and attendance, point of sale, and the supporting mobile computers, barcode scanners and barcode printers used to automate operations.
