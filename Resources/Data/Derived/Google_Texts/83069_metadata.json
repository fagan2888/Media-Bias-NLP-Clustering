And the decision by states whether or not to expand that federal-state program for the poor and those with disabilities is having a serious effect on the financial health of hospitals.\n\nSarah Varney from our partner Kaiser Health News has that story.\n\nSARAH VARNEY, Kaiser Health News: A steady drizzle hasn\u2019t deterred Jason Whiten from coming to this clinic in South Seattle to see if he qualified for Apple Health, Washington\u2019s popular Medicaid program.\n\nISRAEL RUBINOS, Neighborcare Health: You don\u2019t have any medical insurance, right?\n\nJASON WHITEN: No.\n\nISRAEL RUBINOS: No? OK. And how about dental?\n\nJASON WHITEN: No.\n\nISRAEL RUBINOS: No dental, no medical?\n\nJASON WHITEN: No.\n\nISRAEL RUBINOS: OK.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: Whiten, who is 34 years old, has gone without health insurance for 16 years.\n\nISRAEL RUBINOS: So you got approved for the Washington Apple health program\u2026\n\nJASON WHITEN: OK.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: He can come here to this Neighborcare Health clinic, instead of the emergency room, to see a physician. It\u2019s his first insured primary care checkup since becoming an adult.\n\nDR. MARCUS REMPEL, Neighborcare Health: And just take breaths in and out and relax.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: Medicaid had long been restricted, mostly to poor children and pregnant women and the disabled. Under the Affordable Care Act, states could open up their programs to nearly all poor adults; 27 states and the District of Columbia accepted the federal funds to do so.\n\nThe state of Washington took up the cause with mission-like zeal. King County officials worked closely with community partners to put advertisements and enrollment helpers in the places visited by the working poor \u2014 like libraries, bus stations, courts, food banks, even restaurants.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: King County Executive Dow Constantine says Washington blew past Medicaid enrollment targets it didn\u2019t expect to reach until 2017. The county acted quickly, he says, because it could no longer bear the cost of so many uninsured residents.\n\nDOW CONSTANTINE, King County, Washington, Executive: It costs us all. It costs us in absenteeism at work. It costs us in days missed at school, and it just plain costs us on our health care bills. It is irrational. And the ACA presented us an opportunity to have a more rational system. And we took it.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: These aggressive efforts to sign up Washington residents for Medicaid has been a boon to hospitals. Here at Harborview, Seattle\u2019s largest safety net hospital, the percentage of uninsured patients has dropped from 14 percent to 4 percent.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, most people who walk through Harborview\u2019s doors, like Ghidey Tesfaye, are eligible for some form of insurance. In the past, Harborview would have treated uninsured patients like Tesfaye and been stuck with the bill.\n\nIndeed, Harborview provided about $220 million in so-called uncompensated or charity care last year. The federal government helps cover some of those costs, since hospitals can\u2019t turn patients away from the E.R. But during negotiations over the health law, hospitals took a big gamble. They agreed to staggering cuts in federal uncompensated care payments, with the expectation that they would soon have millions of new Medicaid customers.\n\nFor hospitals in states that expanded Medicaid, the bet paid off.\n\nJohnese Spisso oversees the University of Washington\u2019s clinics and hospitals, including Harborview.\n\nJOHNESE SPISSO, Chief Health System Officer, U.W. Medicine: We anticipate our numbers for charity care this year will reduce by about 20 million to 30 million. And as we continue to get more patients signed up, we see that flattening.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: Moving Medicaid patients away from expensive emergency care to primary care clinics is another way the hospital is trying to save money.\n\nSeattle resident Zoe Azalea says it is a change that has helped her take control of her health again. For three years, the former nurse relied on yoga in the park as one of her only means of dealing with crippling pain. A series of accidents left her unable to work, and she lost her health insurance. Without access to physical therapy, the results became devastating.\n\nZOE AZALEA, Harborview Medical Center Patient: I wasn\u2019t able even to use this hand at all or grip. And I couldn\u2019t even pick up a water bottle.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: A social worker called Azalea at home and urged her to enroll in Apple Health. Now that she has her Medicaid card, she has been able to get physical and occupational therapy and see specialists, including a spine doctor.\n\nDr. Richard Goss is the medical director at Harborview. He says, insured patients undeniably get better access to medical care than uninsured ones.\n\nDR. RICHARD GOSS, Medical Director, Harborview Medical Center: Over the many years that I have worked here, I have seen all too many scenarios where people present with cancer, or with advanced heart disease or lung disease or strokes, and they\u2019d gone for many years without access to care. When there\u2019s basic health care coverage, so many more doors are open.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: Across the nation, hospitals in states that expanded Medicaid have recorded sharp declines in uninsured admissions \u2014 30 percent in the first quarter of 2014, and 50 to 70 percent in the second quarter.\n\nUnpaid hospital bills are expected to fall by $4.2 billion this year in states that allowed poor adults into Medicaid. In states that didn\u2019t, the drop is expected to be $1.5 billion, mostly from people who bought private coverage in the new marketplaces.\n\nCaroline Pearson tracks state Medicaid decisions at Avalere Health, a research and consulting company.\n\nCAROLINE PEARSON, Avalere Health: When the law passed and the hospitals sort of signed on for these cuts, Medicaid expansion was expected to be mandatory in every state. Of course, that changed when the Supreme Court made Medicaid expansion optional, and the hospitals are really the ones that have been caught in the crosshairs of that decision.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: Pearson says it\u2019s a precarious time for hospitals because of the cuts for covering the uninsured that they agreed to when the Affordable Care Act was being debated.\n\nCAROLINE PEARSON: Some of these hospitals may end up in the red as a result of failure to expand Medicaid. And those cuts grow each year, so it\u2019s a problem that is going to get worse over time.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: I\u2019m here in Winchester, Virginia, in the Shenandoah Valley. The local hospital here is already beginning to feel those federal cuts. Unlike in Seattle, though, the percentage of uninsured residents has declined very little.\n\nVirginia\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature has rejected pleas by the state hospital association to expand Medicaid, and that\u2019s left hospitals like Winchester Medical Center, run by Valley Health System, facing double jeopardy.\n\nNURSE: You\u2019re diabetic?\n\nPATIENT: Yes.\n\nNURSE: High blood pressure?\n\nPATIENT: Yes.\n\nNURSE: High cholesterol?\n\nPATIENT: Yes.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: In response to its own worsening finances, Valley Health laid off 28 people and is taking a hard look at costly services like its trauma center that treats people after car accidents and other serious injuries.\n\nMark Merrill is the CEO of Valley Health.\n\nMARK MERRILL, CEO, Valley Health: That\u2019s an expensive endeavor. And as these payment cuts continue to go, we have to evaluate, are these the types of programs, like the trauma, like behavioral health, that we can sustain? There is a need for those services certainly here, but if the reimbursement doesn\u2019t justify the ability to sustain those, we have to evaluate whether or not we can continue these.\n\nSARAH VARNEY: Merrill and other hospital executives say the divide between states expanding Medicaid and those that have not could lead to a new type of two-tiered system in U.S. hospitals \u2014 between those able to maintain robust services in states like Washington \u2026 and those like Virginia, sliding into greater financial uncertainty.\n\nI\u2019m Sarah Varney in Winchester, Virginia, for the \u201cPBS NewsHour.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The first map in this segment illustrating states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (as of December 2014) did not include Minnesota.
