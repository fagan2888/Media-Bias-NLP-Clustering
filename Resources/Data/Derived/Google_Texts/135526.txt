× Community Health Fair offers a one-stop shop for health questions and answers

MILWAUKEE (WITI) — ‘Prevention is Power’ — that’s the slogan for Saturday’s Community Health Fair in Milwaukee. This comes as the city celebrates ‘Minority Health Month.’

Organizers call it a one-stop shop for health. People could generate health or dental screenings free of charge at the event. If more care was needed, health officials helped refer them to the right doctors.

More importantly, organizers say the event is a good way to get people talking about their health.

“If we can get people out to come just for general screenings that is a start, so we can help tackle some of the problems that are in our community,” said Pamela Clark, with Milwaukee Health Services.

Folks at the event could also learn about all the different insurance options that are out there.
