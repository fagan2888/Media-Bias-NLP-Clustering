Obama bowed to political pressure from his fellow Democrats on Thursday and announced a plan to let insurers renew for one year the health plans for Americans whose policies would be otherwise canceled due to Obamacare. REUTERS/Larry Downing (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS HEALTH TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY) - RTX15DNW\n\n3994399\n\nThe company that earned the no-bid contract to build the failed Obamacare website also runs the Army\u2019s disastrous Human Terrain System in Iraq and Afghanistan, which has been accused of fraud, sexual harassment and racism.\n\nThe much-maligned Human Terrain System (HTS), launched in 2007, sends academics from social science fields like anthropology and linguistics into war zones to help soldiers understand the local population. The Army spent $58 million on the program in 2013, down from $114 million in 2011.\n\nCGI Federal, the U.S. arm of the Canadian CGI Group and the designer of the failed Obamacare website, attempted a failed turnaround in HTS during the Obama administration. The young company, which employs Michelle Obama\u2019s former Princeton classmate and Christmas guest Toni Townes-Whitley as a top executive, received eight figures from the Army in 2013 for the project, records reveal.\n\nOberon Associates, a CGI Federal subsidiary that joined the CGI portfolio in 2010, earned the $227 million contract to run HTS in 2011 in a deal that insiders said reeked of cronyism due to former HTS director Colonel Sharon Hamilton\u2019s rumored friendship with an Oberon co-founder.\n\nThe HTS contract was one of CGI\u2019s first big gets in the United States, as CGI Federal was only formed to bring the CGI Group into the federal contracting business in 2009.\n\nCGI Federal received a more than $45.5 million modification this year to continue work on the Federal Terrain System.\n\n\u201cThey took over in 2011. There were high hopes that CGI Federal could turn it around, but there\u2019s a hearing going on now into fraud, waste and abuse,\u201d John Stanton, author of \u201cGeneral David Petraeus\u2019 Favorite Mushroom: Inside the US Army\u2019s Human Terrain System,\u201d told The Daily Caller.\n\n\u201cMany troops were injured defending Human Terrain system academics,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cI was just kind of stunned to see CGI Federal running that [Obamacare] website. To me, it\u2019s an example of bad contracting and bad government oversight.\u201d\n\nHTS team members were found to have engaged in instances of fraud, sexual harassment and racism in 2009 and 2010, prior to CGI\u2019s takeover, according to recently released documents. An Army internal investigation found program supervisors inflating overtime and comp time pay, and members even admitted to filing for hours that they didn\u2019t work.\n\n\u201cMy supervisor is the laziest, most incompetent human being I have ever met,\u201d according to one internal Army complaint from a member of the program.\n\n\u201cSexual harassment is prevalent and sexist behavior is an everyday occurrence; I was sexually harassed in the field repeatedly; sexual comments and jokes are rampant; nearly every female in the program faces some form of sexual harassment,\u201d according to another complaint.\n\nCGI\u2019s management of the program failed to sufficiently turn things around, with Stanton noting that the problematic behavior continued.\n\nThe program\u2019s failures have not escaped notice on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cThe HTS reduction is long overdue and it\u2019s good to see the Army take this initial action to downsize the program,\u201d said Rep. Duncan Hunter of the House Armed Services Committee in 2013. \u201cThe program definitely requires an even closer look for reasons pertaining to both past performance and future necessity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho wants to keep the Human Terrain System around? Who in the Pentagon? Nobody else can figure it out,\u201d Stanton said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragicomic program.\u201d\n\nCGI Federal did not return a request for comment.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "The company that earned the no-bid contract to build the failed Obamacare website also runs the Army's disastrous Human Terrain System in Iraq and Afghanistan", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The company that earned the no-bid contract to build the failed Obamacare website also runs the Army's disastrous Human Terrain System in Iraq and Afghanistan, which has been accused of fraud, sexual", "title": "Obamacare website-maker runs failed Army Human Terrain System program", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/12/01/obamacare-website-maker-runs-failed-army-human-terrain-system-program/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sad-obama.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'I was just kind of stunned to see CGI Federal running that website'", "title": "Obamacare website-maker runs failed Army Human Terrain System program Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/12/01/obamacare-website-maker-runs-failed-army-human-terrain-system-program/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sad-obama.jpg"}, "creator": "@patrickhowleydc", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-01 21:32:00", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare website-maker runs failed Army Human Terrain System program", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obama-administration,patrick-howley", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "cgi federal,obama administration", "sailthru.description": "The company that earned the no-bid contract to build the failed Obamacare website also runs the Army's disastrous Human Terrain System in Iraq and Afghanistan, which has been accused of fraud, sexual", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/sad-obama.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c27\"", "article_summary": "CGI Federal received a more than $45.5 million modification this year to continue work on the Federal Terrain System.\nCGI Federal, the U.S. arm of the Canadian CGI Group and the designer of the failed Obamacare website, attempted a failed turnaround in HTS during the Obama administration.\n\u201cI was just kind of stunned to see CGI Federal running that [Obamacare] website.\nThe much-maligned Human Terrain System (HTS), launched in 2007, sends academics from social science fields like anthropology and linguistics into war zones to help soldiers understand the local population.\n\u201cThe program definitely requires an even closer look for reasons pertaining to both past performance and future necessity.\u201d\u201cWho wants to keep the Human Terrain System around?"}
