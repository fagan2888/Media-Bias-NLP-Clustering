The Naper Lights display, which features free admission, will be open to the public from 5 to 9 p.m. Thursdays through Saturdays through Dec. 31.\n\nThe Jamboree included musical performances by the Chicago Sinfonietta's Project Inclusion Ensemble and the Alena Quintet from Metea Valley High School.\n\nKids also got a chance to send a last-minute letter to Santa when they visited the settlement's North Pole post office. They also learned how to package a special reindeer food for the hungry fliers, to be sprinkled on lawns in anticipation of their arrival.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Daily Herald is suburban Chicago's largest daily newspaper.
