WASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ Two Central New York congressmen broke with their party Tuesday on a Republican attempt to override President Barack Obama's veto of a bill to repeal his landmark health care law.

The House voted 241-186 in a failed effort to gain the two-thirds majority needed to override Obama's veto.

U.S. Reps. John Katko, R-Camillus, and Richard Hanna, R-Barneveld, were among only three House Republicans (joining Rep. Bob Dold, R-Ill.) to split with the party in the vote.

The vote was consistent with the position the three GOP House members took last month when they voted against the Republican repeal bill. Katko and Hanna said Tuesday their position had not changed.

Katko said he wants to change the Affordable Care Act, but refuses to vote for a repeal bill until Republicans come up with a viable replacement.

Hanna had different reasons for voting against the repeal. The bill included a measure to cut off federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which he opposes. He called the House effort a meaningless political ploy.

"As I said earlier this month, the president would veto this bill, and tonight, Congress failed to override that veto," Hanna said. "I voted 'no' on the veto message because this was a political exercise that accomplished nothing."
