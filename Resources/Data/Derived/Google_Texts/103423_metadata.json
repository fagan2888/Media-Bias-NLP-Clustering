Fixated on racial bean-counting, Mayor Bill de Blasio is constantly tightening an already short leash on the Police Department and clumsily trying to persuade the public that Commissioner Bill Bratton is a full partner in the effort.\n\nThe result is two-fold: concern that the changes are nothing more than wacky left-wing social engineering, and suspicions that City Hall is not being honest about Bratton\u2019s role.\n\nThe pattern certainly holds with the new policy of reducing marijuana arrests. Although the mayor and the top cop held a press conference to announce the policy, the changes are, for Bratton, a flip-flop. Earlier this year, he recommitted himself to \u201cbroken-windows\u201d policing and vowed the NYPD would not stop making arrests for pot possession even after the Brooklyn district attorney announced he would not prosecute low-level cases.\n\nYet City Hall claimed Bratton and his aides hatched the new idea and that it was \u201cfully supported\u201d by de Blasio. My money is on the sources who told The Post that de Blasio ordered the changes and Bratton was forced to agree.\n\nIf so, the mayoral motto would be: If at first you don\u2019t succeed, mislead again.\n\nThe changes mean simple possession of nearly an ounce of pot brings a summons instead of a misdemeanor arrest in most cases. Exceptions include public smoking and failure to produce an ID, though they have loopholes.\n\nThe mayor, citing the fact that most pot arrests involve non-white males, said, \u201cWhen an individual is arrested, even for the smallest possession of marijuana, it hurts their chances to get a good job; it hurts their chances to get housing; it hurts their chances to qualify for a student loan.\u201d\n\nNo doubt there are some cases where that parade of horribles is true, but getting the Legislature to change the law is the way to resolve demonstrated unfairness. Republicans in the state Senate refused to go along with a similar proposal last winter, saying nearly an ounce of pot was too much to excuse. Their resistance is probably why de Blasio made the change unilaterally now, days after the GOP won an outright majority.\n\nMoreover, it is worth paying attention to the reaction of police unions skeptical of de Blasio\u2019s overall approach to law enforcement.\n\n\u201cI just see it as another step in giving the streets back to the criminals,\u201d said Michael J. Palladino, head of the Detectives\u2019 Endowment Association.\n\nThe head of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, Ed Mullins, was similarly worried. \u201cPeople are asking: \u2018What is going on? Is this department losing its mind? Has the city lost its mind?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd Pat Lynch, head of the police officers union, said, \u201cWe do not want police officers left holding the bag if crime rises because of poor policy.\u201d\n\nTheir worries get us back to Bratton. His deal with the mayor is the worst-kept secret in Gotham: His crime-fighting chops give the lefty de Blasio credibility, and Bratton gets his old job back as a reward for bashing the department under Ray Kelly.\n\nBut the deal is inherently unstable because it depends on crime staying down. The problem is that the mayor, with both a personal bent and a political base largely hostile to the NYPD, always looks for ways to pull back on enforcement and even surveillance. To keep his job, Bratton is forced to go along and publicly sing his boss\u2019 praises.\n\nThe upshot is that it seems they intend to keep tightening the cops\u2019 leash until crime takes off.\n\nNone of this is a happy thought, nor a lasting state of affairs. Something has to give, and at this rate, it will give soon.\n\nO\u2019care not just sick, it\u2019s stupid\n\nIt\u2019s the stupid, stupid.\n\nIn the annals of elitist contempt for ordinary Americans, the remarks of an ObamaCare architect stand out. Jonathan Gruber of MIT, who helped shape the complex law, admitted the opaqueness was intentional.\n\n\u201cLack of transparency is a huge political advantage,\u201d he told a 2013 conference that had remained secret until now. \u201cCall it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically, that was really, really critical for the thing to pass.\u201d\n\nGruber\u2019s arrogance became public only because a conservative group, American Commitment, posted his remarks on YouTube. His words shock without surprising.\n\nRemember Nancy Pelosi\u2019s outrageous argument in 2010 that \u201cwe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it.\u201d\n\nRemember, too, the quid pro quos where a handful of Senate Democrats sold their votes for grants and carve-outs.\n\nThere was the Louisiana Purchase, the Cornhusker Kickback and the Gator Aid. And many big unions that wanted the bill belatedly discovered they needed to be exempt from its provisions, or their members would suffer a rollback in benefits.\n\nAnd don\u2019t forget President Obama\u2019s dozens of rewrites, a key plank in the claim that he has stretched executive power past the breaking point.\n\nObamaCare was the largest piece of legislation ever passed on a strict party-line vote, and it marked the height of Democratic power. Two midterm elections later, Dems have lost both the House and the Senate, and ObamaCare was a prime reason.\n\nStill, it is the law and remains unpopular and unworkable. It is going back to the Supreme Court for another challenge and Republicans say they will move to repeal and replace the whole thing.\n\nThey won\u2019t succeed as long as Obama is in the White House, meaning we haven\u2019t heard the end of this misbegotten mess.\n\nA cynical glovefest\n\nPresident Obama, man of principle. Or principal.\n\nThe president stumbled through his press conference after the midterm massacre, claiming he wasn\u2019t \u201cmopey\u201d about the drubbing.

As he adopted the new feisty tone, political operatives asked for donations, saying \u201cthe fight for change\u201d goes on.\n\nWhat they\u2019re really saying is that accepting the will of the people and working with the other side doesn\u2019t inspire donors to write checks.
