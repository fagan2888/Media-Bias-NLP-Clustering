Five of those states, according to Cooper, have similar \u201cdisplay-and-describe\u201d requirements while another four require physicians to give an explanation of an ultrasound if a woman requests it.\n\nThe appeals court wrote in December the law \u201cimposes a virtually unprecedented burden on the right of professional speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe state cannot commandeer the doctor-patient relationship to compel a physician to express its preference to the patient,\u201d Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III wrote for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. \u201cThis compelled speech, even though it is a regulation of the medical profession, is ideological in intent and kind.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court did not list a reason in Monday\u2019s appeals rejection. Justice Antonin Scalia dissented, but also did not detail his decision.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Women wanting abortions were required to see an ultrasound in North Carolina.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Women wanting abortions were required to see an ultrasound in North Carolina.", "title": "Supreme Court Rejects Appeal for Mandatory Ultrasound Law", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/616ultrasound.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-17T11:50:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1GXBUhw"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Women wanting abortions were required to see an ultrasound in North Carolina.", "title": "Supreme Court Rejects Appeal for Mandatory Ultrasound Law", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/616ultrasound.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-06-16T18:41:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-17T11:50:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce4df\"", "article_summary": "The Supreme Court rejected an appeal Monday from North Carolina state officials attempting to restore a state law requiring doctors to conduct ultrasounds and describe the fetuses to women wanting an abortion.\nThe court\u2019s refusal left intact an appeals court decision deeming the law unconstitutional under the First Amendment for violating doctors\u2019 free speech rights.\n\u201cThis compelled speech, even though it is a regulation of the medical profession, is ideological in intent and kind.\u201dThe Supreme Court did not list a reason in Monday\u2019s appeals rejection.\nFive of those states, according to Cooper, have similar \u201cdisplay-and-describe\u201d requirements while another four require physicians to give an explanation of an ultrasound if a woman requests it.\nThe appeals court wrote in December the law \u201cimposes a virtually unprecedented burden on the right of professional speech.\u201d\u201cThe state cannot commandeer the doctor-patient relationship to compel a physician to express its preference to the patient,\u201d Judge J.
