Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a likely contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThe ad \u2014 a product of Bill Connor\u2019s campaign \u2014 calls Graham\u2019s purported conservative credentials into question with clips of the South Carolina senator saying that Clinton is \u201cdedicated to her job\u201d and \u201cone of the most effective secretary of states, greatest ambassadors for the United States\u201d that he\u2019s ever seen:\n\n\u201cI was at the TEA Party debate when I first saw this footage of Graham praising and hugging Hillary. I thought it represented what\u2019s most frustrating to South Carolina conservatives about Lindsey Graham\u2013the inherent hypocrisy of calling himself a conservative when he campaigns, but acting like and voting like a moderate or liberal the rest of the time,\u201d Connor said in a statement from his campaign. \u201cMy plan was always to get on TV first and to stay there.\u201d\n\nConnor blasted the ad Graham\u2019s campaign began airing last week, which sought to reestablish his conservative credentials. The insurgent Tea Party candidate isn\u2019t convinced, saying that Graham is trying to pull off an \u201celection year conservative makeover.\u201d\n\n\u201c The Graham ad starts with his claim of always opposing Obamacare when the truth is he didn\u2019t stand with the 19 true conservatives to stop the funding,\u201d Connor said. \u201cHe touts siding with Jim DeMint, but the truth is on the two most important votes they both cast, Graham voted to confirm two liberal Supreme Court Justices (Kagan and Sotomayor) and DeMint voted against them.\n\n\u201cHe rails on the administration about Benghazi, but in private has nothing but praise for Hillary. He evens claims to be pro-jobs, but the truth is he supported an internet tax that would cost jobs,\u201d he added.\n\nConnor is one of five primary challengers running against Graham. Though his job approval numbers among South Carolina Republicans have taken a hit in the last year, Graham still holds large leads over his primary opponents, though it\u2019s unclear if he\u2019ll have enough support to avoid a runoff.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Bill Connor,Conservatives,GOP primary,Hillary Clinton,Lindsey Graham,primary challenge,Republicans,Secretary of State,South Carolina,Tea Party,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "description": "Hillary Clinton and Lindsey Graham A conservative primary challenger has rolled out an ad that ties Sen.
