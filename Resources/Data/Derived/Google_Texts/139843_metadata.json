(Photo: Steve Hockstein/Harvard Studio Photography)\n\nNEW BRUNSWICK - Five years after it had no presence in health care, a revamped Rutgers unveiled a plan Wednesday that its academic leadership believes \u201cleapfrogs\u201d the state university of New Jersey to the front of a patient-first system of care.\n\nThe university\u2019s Board of Governors approved the creation of Rutgers Health, a new clinical branch that officials say will be unique as an academic health care provider organization because of its multiprofessional integration of physicians, physician\u2019s assistants, nurses, dentists and more.\n\nRutgers Health will unite 1,000 faculty members at 12 units, including the New Jersey Medical School, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers Cancer Institute and Rutgers\u2019 schools of pharmacy, psychology, dental medicine, nursing, social work and behavioral health care.\n\n\u201cWe are putting all of our clinical care providers in a single entity,\u201d Rutgers President Robert Barchi told media members, \u201cbecause the future of health care is a team-based approach.\u201d\n\nThe establishment of Rutgers Health \u2014 the policy brand \u2014 is the first move in a three-step multiyear implementation process.\n\nRutgers Health Group will be the subsidiary nonprofit corporation that functions as the statewide faculty practice, and Rutgers Health Network eventually will encompass affiliated hospitals and community care centers under the umbrella across the state, including the RWJ Barnabas merged entity created last week.\n\n\u201cWhat Rutgers Health brings to the RWJ Barnabas system,\u201d Barchi said, \u201cis the pipeline of research from bench to bedside.\u201d\n\nThis new approach reflects a national trend powered by the Affordable Care Act, in which health care institutions benefit from keeping people healthy rather than treating the sick.\n\n\u201cThis will give us the ability to give a kind of medical care that hasn\u2019t been available in the state of New Jersey before,\u201d said Brian Strom, executive vice president for health affairs and chancellor of Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences, which was created in 2013.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, Rutgers Health will be about patients,\u201d Strom said. \u201cUltimately, all Rutgers Health locations will represent a place patients can go to receive all of their care \u2014 to get well and to stay well. Physicians, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, social workers, clinical psychologists and researchers will work together, creating a leading academic health care provider organization distinguished by the quality and breadth of patient services.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will end up with the state university being dramatically stronger academically in terms of training and keeping our graduates in New Jersey,\u201d he added. \u201cThe net result of this multi-year process will be a healthy New Jersey. That is the goal. This is the structure to achieve that.\u201d\n\nBarchi and Strom described the formation of Rutgers Health as \u201cfaculty driven\u201d and said it is the product of 18 months of negotiations. Wednesday\u2019s launch falls within the year-long 250th anniversary celebration of Rutgers as \u201crevolutionary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a hugely significant movement,\u201d Board chair Greg Brown said at the meeting conducted in Winants Hall. \u201cThis is a big move for Rutgers.\u201d\n\nWhat separates Rutgers Health from other medical school plans \u2014 including the one that formerly existed at UMDNJ \u2014 or smaller health-care provider groups in New Jersey is the anticipated coordination of the larger range of different specialties available.\n\n\u201cThe goal here is to shift the focus to the patient, both keeping them healthy and organizing in a way that meets the need of people,\u201d Strom said. \u201cThe advantage Rutgers has is we produce them all. We can take our trainees and place them in the right places to give the proper population care.\u201d\n\nRutgers Health will offer many benefits to patients, officials said. With a multidisciplinary teams of care providers,the number of patient admissions will be minimized and paperwork reduced, thereby eliminating duplication of services and preventing medical errors. Rutgers Health also will leverage its statewide presence by negotiating with vendors to gain other cost efficiencies for patients.\n\nRutgers\u2019 clinical practices accommodate more than 1.7 million patient visits per year, according to the school.\n\nFaculty at the New Jersey Medical School and Robert Wood Johnson Medical School will be more closely engaged and will find it easier to work together.\n\n\u201cAll of us realize that this is an inevitable necessity,\u201d Barchi said. \u201cThe way we did business 10 years ago is not the way we will be doing business 10 years from now. To not change is to be left behind. In this case, we have a remarkable consensus that change is needed.\u201d\n\nBarchi described the cost incurred of the creation as \u201cminimal\u201d for an entity the size of Rutgers.\n\nWithout an integrated clinical entity, Rutgers was likely to lose tens of millions of dollars in reimbursement from medical insurers under the new health care model, Barchi said.\n\n\u201cIf we succeed in doing this, we can gain the value-based reimbursements and become leaders in the field,\u201d Barchi said. \u201cAnd you are talking about swings in the other direction. The cost of not doing this is huge. The opportunity of doing this right is also huge.\u201d\n\nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.cpsj.com/1S0B9Xu", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Rutgers Health\u2019s statewide network of 1,000 clinical care providers offers expanded patient access while aiming to lower costs", "og": {"site_name": "Courier-Post", "description": "Rutgers Health\u2019s statewide network of 1,000 clinical care providers offers expanded patient access while aiming to lower costs", "title": "Rutgers Health unites providers in new \u2018team\u2019 approach", "url": "http://www.courierpostonline.com/story/news/2016/04/07/rutgers-health-unites-providers-new-team-approach/82774794/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courierpostonline.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rutgers Health\u2019s statewide network of 1,000 clinical care providers offers expanded patient access while aiming to lower costs", "title": "Rutgers Health unites providers in new \u2018team\u2019 approach", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3a4889705c53bd4025b2ed25de50a5888ce53da7/c=600-0-3000-2400&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/07/CherryHill/B9321674697Z.1_20160407211605_000_GPAE05TKV.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@cpsj", "site": "@cpsj", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=789840748", "fb": {"app_id": 175025579194557}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Rutgers Health, health care"}, "article_summary": "Rutgers Health will unite 1,000 faculty members at 12 units, including the New Jersey Medical School, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers Cancer Institute and Rutgers\u2019 schools of pharmacy, psychology, dental medicine, nursing, social work and behavioral health care.\nRutgers Health also will leverage its statewide presence by negotiating with vendors to gain other cost efficiencies for patients.\nFaculty at the New Jersey Medical School and Robert Wood Johnson Medical School will be more closely engaged and will find it easier to work together.\n\u201cWe are putting all of our clinical care providers in a single entity,\u201d Rutgers President Robert Barchi told media members, \u201cbecause the future of health care is a team-based approach.\u201dThe establishment of Rutgers Health \u2014 the policy brand \u2014 is the first move in a three-step multiyear implementation process.\n\u201cFirst and foremost, Rutgers Health will be about patients,\u201d Strom said."}
