Barbara Brosher Barbara Brosher\n\nBLOOMINGTON -- Medical device manufacturers across the country are getting some temporary relief after lawmakers passed a two-year suspension of the medical device tax at the end of last year.\n\nThe life sciences industry has been trying to repeal the tax since it took effect in January 2013, including several Indiana companies. The 2.3 percent levy helps offset the costs of the Affordable Care Act, but opponents argue it\u2019s a job killer and prohibits growth of the industry.\n\nMany Indiana companies are hopeful the suspension will eventually turn into a full repeal of the tax.\n\nTax Halted Expansion For Bloomington-based Cook\n\nThe warehouse at Cook Medical\u2019s Bloomington headquarters is bustling with energy.\n\nA pressurized conveyor belt pushes dozens of white and red packages down the line, where workers throw in plastic packaging before sending them off to be shipped around the world.\n\nCook employs about 5,000 people in Indiana and the company would like to expand its operations. But company officials decided to put some of those plans on hold when the medical device tax went into effect three years ago.\n\n\u201cWhen the tax was first adopted by Congress, Cook had on its design table five manufacturing plants that they were hoping to building in the United States,\u201d says Vice President of Public Policy Gretchen Gutman. \u201cAnd the minute that tax was adopted, those expansion plans were put on hold.\u201d\n\nThe medical device tax helps offset the costs of the Affordable Care Act. The argument is since medical device manufacturers could benefit from expanded healthcare coverage nationwide, they should help foot some of the bill.\n\nThe Congressional Research Service estimates the levy could generate $29 billion in net revenues over the next decade.\n\nBut medical device manufacturers like Cook say that\u2019s coming at a significant cost to them.\n\n\u201cA lot of people say it was just 2.3 percent, but the real impact at Cook was it raised our tax liability 32 percent,\u201d Gutman says.\n\nIndiana Legislators Pushing For Full Repeal Of Tax\n\nThe medical device tax is an excise tax, which means it\u2019s an off the top tax that isn\u2019t paid for directly by consumers.\n\nThat translates to a significant impact on the finances of Indiana manufacturers \u2014 whether they\u2019re making money or not.\n\n\u201cFor companies that are doing well, some calculations I\u2019ve seen on the back of an envelope it\u2019s probably equivalent to a 10 or 15 percent increase in income tax,\u201d says George Telthorst, Director of the Center for Business Life Sciences at Indiana University\u2019s Kelley School of Business.\n\nFor the next two years companies won\u2019t have to shoulder that burden.\n\nLawmakers passed a suspension of the tax with their spending budget in December.\n\n\u201cIt never should have been put there in the first place,\u201d says Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. \u201cIt is a tax unlike any other tax. If you don\u2019t make a profit \u2014 if you don\u2019t earn an income \u007f\u2014 then you don\u2019t pay tax. But this one imposed taxes whether you had a profit or not, simply on your sales. And a lot of these new companies that were coming on simply in the development stage weren\u2019t making a profit and yet had to forfeit over big money to the IRS.\u201d\n\nThe Life Sciences industry is huge in Indiana \u2014 accounting for roughly one-third of the state\u2019s exports. Because of the industry\u2019s impact, both of Indiana\u2019s senators support a full repeal of the medical device tax. But multiple efforts to kill the tax have failed.\n\nThey\u2019re hopeful that could change next year.\n\n\u201cSeventy nine senators voted on a budget bill a couple years ago stating their position on full repeal,\u201d Coats says. \u201cThat was a very substantial amount of Democrats on their side and all the Republicans. Seventy nine out of 100 is a pretty good indicator that there will be real support for going forward under a new president.\u201d\n\nUntil then, companies like Cook say the temporary relief will allow them to address short-term needs like hiring.\n\nBut once the suspension expires, they\u2019ll be faced with more tough decisions.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t pay for a tax that has that kind of impact by reducing the number of pencils or paper clips that you buy,\u201d Gutman says. \u201cIt really means you\u2019re not going to expand your company, you\u2019re not going to do R&D research. It really has an impact on allowing a company to innovate.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bloomington, medical device tax, Cook Medical", "pubdate": "2016-03-04", "author": "Barbara Brosher", "og": {"site_name": "WFYI Public Media", "description": "Medical device manufacturers across the country are getting some temporary relief after lawmakers passed a two-year suspension of the medical device tax at the end of last year.", "title": "Medical Device Tax Suspension Gives Hoosier Companies Relief", "url": "http://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/medical-device-tax-suspension-gives-hoosier-companies-relief", "image": "http://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/current/cook-medical-device-940x626.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 2.3 percent tax helps offset costs of the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, but life sciences companies have fought to repeal it for three years.", "creator": "@babsofbtown", "image": {"src": "http://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/current/cook-medical-device-940x626.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/current/cook-medical-device-940x626.jpg"}, "title": "Medical Device Tax Suspension Gives Hoosier Companies Relief", "site": "@WFYINews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "WFYI", "date": "2016-03-04", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-04T00:00:00-05:00"}, "KEYWORDS": "Bloomington, medical device tax, Cook Medical", "thumbnail": "http://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/medium/cook-medical-device-940x626.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Medical device manufacturers across the country are getting some temporary relief after lawmakers passed a two-year suspension of the medical device tax at the end of last year."}, "article_summary": "Barbara Brosher Barbara BrosherBLOOMINGTON -- Medical device manufacturers across the country are getting some temporary relief after lawmakers passed a two-year suspension of the medical device tax at the end of last year.\n\u201cAnd the minute that tax was adopted, those expansion plans were put on hold.\u201dThe medical device tax helps offset the costs of the Affordable Care Act.\nBut company officials decided to put some of those plans on hold when the medical device tax went into effect three years ago.\nThe argument is since medical device manufacturers could benefit from expanded healthcare coverage nationwide, they should help foot some of the bill.\nBecause of the industry\u2019s impact, both of Indiana\u2019s senators support a full repeal of the medical device tax."}
