See the complete list.\n\nHow does this affect public employees who opt out of union membership?\n\nWhether mandatory fees are called fair share fees, \u201cagency fees\u201d or \u201cadministration fees\u201d in a union contract, the result for workers covered by the contract is the same: having a job means paying the union.\n\nFair share fees \u2014 often hundreds of dollars per year \u2014 can be as expensive as regular union dues. The mandatory fees are deducted from workers\u2019 paychecks automatically.\n\nGreg Lawson, a policy analyst for the free-market Buckeye Institute, told Ohio Watchdog fair share fees are \u201cunfair\u201d to workers who don\u2019t want to join a union.\n\nPublic employee union fair share fees are unfair to taxpayers, too, Lawson explained in an email.\n\nAutomatically deducting union fees from public workers\u2019 paychecks forces taxpayers to support union bosses who negotiate \u2014 often with public officials the unions helped elect \u2014 for more taxpayer money.\n\n\u201cThis means that taxpayer interests are not being considered,\u201d Lawson said.\n\nUnions defend fair share fees as necessary to give workers a voice in the workplace and prevent workers from freeloading on the union\u2019s representation.\n\nThe \u201cfreeloader\u201d argument sounds compelling, but it\u2019s not convincing when weighed against individual workers\u2019 rights, Lawson opined. Why, then, are fair share fees commonplace for Ohio public employees?\n\n\u201cUnions still have a lot of clout, which makes policy changes difficult,\u201d Lawson said.\n\nOfficials in multiple localities where public employee unions take fair share fees failed to respond to requests for comment.\n\nRELATED: Labor unions fund 22 of 23 Ohio Senate Republicans\n\nFederal law forbids unions from spending fair share fees on politics. In Ohio, public-sector fair share payers must follow their workplace union\u2019s rules to request a rebate for union political activity.\n\nThe union calculates the rebate, and any fair share payer who wants to dispute the rebate amount has just 30 days to do so.\n\nLast fall, the Ohio Education Association \u2014 Ohio\u2019s largest labor union \u2014 settled a lawsuit brought by fair share payers who said OEA and several of its affiliates didn\u2019t calculate fair share fees properly.\n\nAt the end of a legal process lasting three years, the teachers who filed the complaint won partial fair share refunds and reduced OEA fees until 2040.\n\nAmong the 50 states, Ohio is in a shrinking minority where public employee unions are concerned.\n\nEven after Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin enacted right-to-work laws, there\u2019s little enthusiasm in the Republican-dominated Ohio General Assembly for tackling the problem of forced union fees.\n\nThis is partly because Ohio Senate Bill 5, a 300-page bundle of changes to the state\u2019s public employee law, was overturned by voters in 2011 after unions spent $40 million campaigning against it.\n\nSupporters of SB 5 failed to adequately defend the law against union ads warning it would destroy public services throughout the state.\n\nBut \u201cfair share\u201d is mentioned only once in the Ohio Revised Code. Public employees throughout the state could be protected from forced union dues with simple changes to a single section of state law.\n\nOhio\u2019s rules for public employee union fair share fees are defined in ORC 4117.09(C):\n\n\u201cThe arrangement does not require any employee to become a member of the employee organization, nor shall fair share fees exceed dues paid by members of the employee organization who are in the same bargaining unit.\u201d\n\nAnd:\n\n\u201cThe deduction of a fair share fee by the public employer from the payroll check of the employee and its payment to the employee organization is automatic and does not require the written authorization of the employee.\u201d\n\nA January poll from free-market think tank Opportunity Ohio indicated 75 percent of Ohioans are against automatic dues deduction for public employee unions, and 52 percent support ending forced union dues for all workers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you want to work in state or local government in Ohio, there's a good chance you'll have to pay a labor union.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "If you want to work in state or local government in Ohio, there's a good chance you'll have to pay a labor union.", "title": "Across Ohio, public employees are forced to pay labor unions - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/08/findlay-municipal-building.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-29T09:11:17+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/234468/ohio-public-employees-unions/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "If you want to work in state or local government in Ohio, there's a good chance you'll have to pay a labor union.", "title": "Across Ohio, public employees are forced to pay labor unions - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/08/findlay-municipal-building.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Labor", "published_time": "2015-08-21T04:00:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-29T09:11:17+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "government unions, public sector unions, public-sector unions, public employee unions, forced union dues, forced union fees, fair share, fair share fees, ohio government unions"}, "article_summary": "RELATED: Labor unions fund 22 of 23 Ohio Senate RepublicansFederal law forbids unions from spending fair share fees on politics.\nUnder state law, Ohio teachers, police, firefighters and other public employees can be forced to pay union \u201cfair share\u201d fees as a condition of employment.\nOfficials in multiple localities where public employee unions take fair share fees failed to respond to requests for comment.\nWhy, then, are fair share fees commonplace for Ohio public employees?\nAmong the 50 states, Ohio is in a shrinking minority where public employee unions are concerned."}
