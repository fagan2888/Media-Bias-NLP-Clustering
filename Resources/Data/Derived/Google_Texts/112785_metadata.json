Under discussion was if his pump fake could be categorized as a \u201cfly by\u201d fake.\n\nLong after practice is officially over, a group of Wizards has a 3-point shooting contest. On the last shot, the player is required to provide an exaggerated pump fake that would cause a defender to jump and fly by. Webster went with a standard pump fake before hitting his final shot, completing the work around the arc before any other player. His teammates, particularly Rasual Butler, who usually wins, cried foul.\n\nWebster is pleased to be smiling because of basketball and meaningless 3-point contests again. He had his third career back surgery in the offseason, pushing back his 2014-15 debut to Dec. 30. He\u2019s still not in sync.\n\n\u201cI still got a little bit of ways to go,\u201d Webster said. \u201cRhythm and timing (are) a little bit off.\u201d\n\nHis return creates a pileup at small forward and shooting guard for the Wizards. Between Webster, Paul Pierce, Otto Porter, Rasual Butler and Bradley Beal, coach Randy Wittman has multiple options, which includes resting Pierce. Wittman opted for that Wednesday night when the Wizards beat the hapless New York Knicks in their first game back from a five-game road trip. Pierce sat on the bench in a suit and wore Cazal glasses, which are Mars Blackmon approved eyewear.\n\nLast week, Porter was on the bench. He did not play Jan. 2 against the Oklahoma City Thunder a game after playing just eight minutes against the Dallas Mavericks. Webster played 14 minutes against the Mavericks. He played five more against the Thunder. Plus, Butler played 30 minutes against Oklahoma City. Pierce was on the floor for 20 minutes. Porter was out of the mix.\n\nLosing his minutes to Webster\u2019s return, at least temporarily, was not a surprise. Porter saw across-the-board reductions in December after a solid November start. Among the regulars in the Wizards\u2019 rotation, Porter has the second-worst player efficiency rating. Only center Kevin Seraphin has a lower mark.\n\nThe key for Porter, according to Wittman, remains his level of aggression. When he\u2019s aggressive, things go well. When he\u2019s not, that\u2019s the inert stage that Wittman says turns players into just \u201can advancement of the ball.\u201d When it touches them, they just get rid of it and move on.\n\n\u201cI like to see him aggressive because he is a smart player,\u201d Wittman said. \u201cHe has good instincts. He can create things for other players. Then, I think that carries over to the other end of the floor for him. He\u2019s a good rebounder. He\u2019s got to continue to work from an individual standpoint from guys who try to take him off the dribble. That\u2019s part of now playing and you pick those things up.\u201d\n\nLegitimate caveats when assessing Porter remain. He\u2019s just 21 years old. He\u2019s only played 70 career games in his season-plus since being drafted third overall out of Georgetown.\n\nAs Porter figures things out, Webster will continue to feel his way. Wednesday night, he took a late charge from Knicks forward Travis Wear. Guilt from making a bad pass that led to the turnover spurred Webster to get back and be in position to take the charge, which knocked him solidly to the ground and onto his bad back. A day later, he reconsidered that strategy. Webster is just 28 years old, but anticipates being near the end of his career because of all the back problems.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m always cognizant that I\u2019m just now getting back and this is my third back surgery,\u201d Webster said. \u201cLast night, I was definitely, really thinking about whether or not to take that charge. After I took it, I thought, \u2018Man, I probably shouldn\u2019t have taken that one.\u2019\n\n\u201cI was OK. But, those types of things are always running through my mind. It\u2019s one of those things when you start to build the muscle memory and get a little bit more repetition, then you don\u2019t think about it.\u201d\n\nPierce practiced Thursday and should be ready to play Friday night against one of the Wizards\u2019 few rivals, the hearty Chicago Bulls. His return plus Webster\u2019s availability will leave Wittman with options. It\u2019s better than the other way around and something Porter will need to aggressively deal with.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Webster's return creates a pileup at small forward and shooting guard for the Wizards.
