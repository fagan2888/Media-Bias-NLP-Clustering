The company is recalling the devices to be extra cautious, though there haven\u2019t been any reported injures yet.\n\nIn a press release, Playtex said that the adapters in question were manufactured from November 2012 to July 2013, and can be identified by the serial number (P12324-XXXX through P13205-XXXX). They could also be identified by their adapter production code, 1241 through 1324. All of the adapters were sold with the Playtex Nurser Deluxe Double Electric Breast Pump, which was sold nationwide.\n\nBreast pumps are used by women who are breast-feeding in order to better extract breast milk, and to provide an easier way for women to store milk. They are considered medical devices and are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n\u201cMany women find it convenient, or even necessary, to use a breast pump to express and store their breast milk once they have returned to work, are traveling, or are otherwise separated from their baby,\u201d the FDA writes on its website. \u201cA breast pump can be used as a supplement to breastfeeding and some pumps are designed to mimic the suckling of a nursing baby.\u201d\n\nAccording to the release, people who have bought this product should contact Playtex for a replacement by calling 1-888-207-1429 between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. ET Monday through Friday.
