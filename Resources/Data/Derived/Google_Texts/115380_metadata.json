He is a professor at the Oregon National Primate Research Center at Oregon Health & Science University.\n\nRevising that vaccination schedule could also save the U.S. health care system hundreds of millions of dollars a year, the researchers added in a university news release.\n\nFor the study, the investigators examined immunity levels in over 500 adults. The researchers found that after completing the standard five-dose childhood vaccine series, adults remain protected against tetanus and diphtheria for at least 30 years without the need for further booster shots.\n\nSlifka and his colleagues said a simplified age-based vaccination schedule for adults could involve a single booster vaccination at age 30 and another one at age 60.\n\n\"If you ask around, you often find that it is hard for people to remember if they had their last tetanus shot eight years ago or even 11 years ago,\" Slifka said. \"If we were to use a simple age-based system, people would only have to remember to get their shots when they turn 30 and again when they turn 60.\"\n\nThe researchers also estimated that changing from a 10-year to a 30-year schedule could save about $280 million in health care costs a year, and about $1 billion over four years.\n\nThe study authors noted that the World Health Organization recommends only a single adult booster vaccination during military service or when a woman becomes pregnant for the first time. The United Kingdom and some other countries recommend no adult booster shots at all.\n\nThe new study was published online March 21 in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, tetanus and diphtheria are infections caused by bacteria. Tetanus-causing bacteria can enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds. Diphtheria can spread from person to person through coughing or sneezing. Both infections are rare in the United States, but can cause severe complications.\n\nMore information\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on tetanus.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/diseases-and-conditions-information-37/tetanus-news-657/adults-don-t-need-booster-shots-for-tetanus-as-often-as-thought-study-709276.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/Images/icimages/vaccine.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "Booster shot every 30 years would protect as well as every 10 years, and save money, researchers contend", "title": "Adults Don't Need Tetanus Shot Every Decade: Study"}, "description": "Booster shot every 30 years would protect as well as every 10 years, and save money, researchers contend", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b45\"", "article_summary": "Slifka and his colleagues said a simplified age-based vaccination schedule for adults could involve a single booster vaccination at age 30 and another one at age 60.\nFRIDAY, March 25, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Adults can get tetanus and diphtheria vaccine boosters every 30 years instead of the recommended 10 years, a new study suggests.\nThe researchers found that after completing the standard five-dose childhood vaccine series, adults remain protected against tetanus and diphtheria for at least 30 years without the need for further booster shots.\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, tetanus and diphtheria are infections caused by bacteria.\nRevising that vaccination schedule could also save the U.S. health care system hundreds of millions of dollars a year, the researchers added in a university news release."}
