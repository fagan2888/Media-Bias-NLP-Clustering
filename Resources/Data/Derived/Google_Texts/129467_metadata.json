The other is a $2 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to IBM, Sutter Health and Geisinger Health System to study how electronic health records can help predict heart failure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Berg-Mount Sinai partnership is particularly interesting because of its scope. It\u2019s focused on analyzing so-called \u201cmulti-omic\u201d biology, which means the study of various systems and fields, including genomics, proteomics and metabolomics. According to Icahn professor Eric Schadt, in the press release announcing the partnership, \u201cWorking with Berg, we plan to analyze big data and create predictive models to discern similarities and differences in disease patterns, identify the most effective treatment and diagnostics, and ultimately, provide better care for our patients.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe IBM-Sutter-Geisinger partnership is actually an extension of earlier work into this same area \u2014 identifying symptoms that often result in heart failure years before any serious issues might occur. According to that press release, \u201cThe NIH funding allows the team to look deeper into the progression of factors that are predictors of heart failure so clinicians can implement timely care-management plans to improve health outcomes. They will begin testing predictive methods for heart failure in clinical practice over the next several years.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeton Healthcare (an IBM customer, actually) has already reaped the benefits of this exact type of analysis. I wrote about it in 2012:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFollowing a CEO mandate to find better ways to detect congestive heart failure early in order to save the exorbitant costs of treatment as the disease progresses, [Seton Healthcare VP of Analytics Ryan] Leslie\u2019s team analyzed a stockpile of data ranging from billing records to patient charts. It found that a distended jugular vein \u2014 something that can be spotted during any routine physical exam \u2014 is a particularly high risk factor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s likely we\u2019re just seeing the tip of the iceberg of what\u2019s possible with big data and health care, though. Obamacare places a heavy emphasis on electronic health records and better data collection, generally, and patients are now able to track an increasing number of potentially valuable data points using smartphones and wearable devices. Health care is huge business tied to lots of IT spending, so if there\u2019s data that can help health care organizations do their jobs better, there will be plenty of researchers and companies willing to help analyze it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFeature image courtesy of Shutterstock user lenetstan.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "More proof that health care loves big data", "application-name": "Gigaom", "dcterms.modified": "2013-10-10", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "dcterms.creator": "Derrick Harris", "dcterms.date": "2013-10-10", "keywords": "big data, biology, genomics, health care, ibm, predictive analytics, research", "news_keywords": "big data, biology, genomics, health care, ibm, predictive analytics, research", "author": "Derrick Harris", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "theme-color": "#ecebe6", "dcterms.publisher": "Gigaom", "description": "Two new research partnerships whose participants range from pharmaceutical companies to IT vendors are taking aim at improving disease treatment via data", "robots": "NOODP", "MobileOptimized": 320, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://gigaom.com/wp-content/themes/go-ossein/library/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "6AFF4FA8C591A576B80A612AF591A343", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "dcterms.created": "2013-10-10", "og": {"image": "https://gigaom.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/1/2012/07/stethoscope.jpg"}, "dcterms.subject": "big data; biology; genomics; health care; ibm; predictive analytics; research", "google-site-verification": "qCPIC6UK_23CR6SxLn2bCjE-Ow0OSYoDExoi699IE98", "y_key": "a09dd3172406080e"}, "article_summary": "Health care is huge business tied to lots of IT spending, so if there\u2019s data that can help health care organizations do their jobs better, there will be plenty of researchers and companies willing to help analyze it.\nThe other is a $2 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to IBM, Sutter Health and Geisinger Health System to study how electronic health records can help predict heart failure.\nIt\u2019s no secret that medical research and health care have already benefited pretty significantly from the technologies and analytic techniques that comprise big data, and two new partnerships underscore the promise.\nObamacare places a heavy emphasis on electronic health records and better data collection, generally, and patients are now able to track an increasing number of potentially valuable data points using smartphones and wearable devices.\nIt found that a distended jugular vein \u2014 something that can be spotted during any routine physical exam \u2014 is a particularly high risk factor.\u201dAdvertisementIt\u2019s likely we\u2019re just seeing the tip of the iceberg of what\u2019s possible with big data and health care, though."}
