Denver Ave. \u2022 Big Beaver Brewing Co. 2707 W. Eisenhower Blvd. \u2022 Loveland Aleworks 118 W. Fourth St. \u2022 Verboten Brewing 1550 Taurus Court \u2022 Buckhorn Brewers 4229 W. Eisenhower Blvd. \u2022 Climb Hard Cider Co. 2707 W. Eisenhower Blvd. \u2022 Crow Hop Brewing 217 E. Third St. \u2022 Big Thompson Brewery 114 E. 15th St.\n\nTwo years of work and waiting are coming to fruition as the owners of Loveland's newest craft brewery create their first batches and prepare to open their doors.\n\nBig Thompson Brewery could welcome its first customers next month, said co-owner Kurt Biegel, although he doesn't have a firm date yet. The brewery at 114 E. 15th St., in the former Skate Castle building, already has approval to brew but is waiting for parking lot issues to be resolved so that it can get its certificate of occupancy from the city, he said.\n\nBiegel and a consultant brewed Big Thompson's first two beers in late June \u2014 an American pale ale and an American pilsner. He wants to have another two to four beers ready when his taproom opens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe bought a 10-barrel, semi-automated brewing system, which is significantly different from the equipment he uses as a homebrewer, so it has taken a while to get accustomed to a new setup, he said.\n\nKegs, bottles, cans\n\nA 10-barrel brewhouse is larger than some craft breweries use when they start out, he said. The capacity to brew 20 kegs' worth at a time fits into his long-term business plan.\n\n\"We do want to be a production brewery and be able to package beer and sell beer out our back door ... in kegs or cans or bottles,\" Biegel said.\n\nOriginally, he said, he expected to start out selling his beer just in the taproom, then begin selling kegs to local restaurants and bars before putting the beer in cans after about a year. But he has been thinking about taking that step sooner because of the apparent interest that area businesses have in carrying local products.\n\nNo niche\n\nBig Thompson Brewery won't stake out a niche for itself, Biegel said.\n\n\"We've talked about that a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of our beers are similar to beers that the other guys brew. But our IPA won't be exactly the same as everybody else's.\n\n\"We do want to bring a couple of unique beers to the environment \u2014 we have a couple of recipes that I haven't seen anywhere else,\" he added.\n\nBiegel said he started homebrewing about six years ago and early on said to his wife, \"You know, this town could use a brewery or two.\" Within a month, he said, he read about Loveland's first independent craft brewery.\n\nHis recipes are mostly his own, he said \u2014 adapted from recipes he has found, and some that he came up with himself.\n\n\"That's one of the most fun things about it, getting a little creative,\" he said.\n\nA chalkboard in the brewery shows another exercise in creativity: potential names of the company's beers, following themes of river, fishing, geographic locations and railroads (the BNSF Railway tracks run directly behind the building, which Biegel counts as an asset).\n\n'There can never be enough'\n\nBiegel is preparing to retire next month after more than 30 years with IBM. He co-owns Big Thompson Brewing Co., with his wife, Barbara, although she will remain mostly a silent partner, he said.\n\nThe proliferation of small breweries in town \u2014 Big Thompson will make eight, plus one cidery \u2014 is fine with Biegel.\n\n\"I don't view it as something that's daunting or challenging,\" he said. \"We've visited all of them. They all brew good beer. Our beers have to be competitive.\"\n\nFort Collins is about twice the size of Loveland, he said, and it has almost 20 breweries.\n\n\"When you go around town and drink at all these breweries, everyone's got something a little different going on,\" he said. \"There can never be enough good craft beer around for people to sample and drink.\"\n\nThe brewery's hours are under discussion but will generally be early afternoon to around 9 at night, seven days a week.
