WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, NC (WWAY) — Several competitors were stung by jellyfish, as the Wilmington Family YMCA and the Cape Fear Aquatic Club hosted the 11th annual Pier 2 Pier swim race Saturday.

Hundreds of competitors swam approximately two miles from Crystal Pier to Johnny Mercer’s Pier across the open ocean water in Wrightsville Beach.

UNCW swimmer George Vlahos has been participating in the event for five years now, but what he and many encountered during the race was a first.

“Jellyfish were a lot more active this year,” Vlahos said. “I’ve never been stung before this year, which I got stung multiple times. A couple times across the face, on the back, arms, legs, everywhere. Jellyfish are definitely more active, but it’s a fun race, and I enjoy it.”

Volunteers sprayed almost every competitor with vinegar as they exited the water to treat the jellyfish stings, but a YMCA spokesman said no one was taken to the hospital.

The race is held each year in memory of Ryan Young, a former UNCW swimmer who died six and a half years ago in an accident.
