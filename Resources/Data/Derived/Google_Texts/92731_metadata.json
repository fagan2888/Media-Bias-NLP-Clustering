Rand Paul (R-KY), in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News here at the South By Southwest music and art festival, says former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u201cclearly broke the law\u201d by using a private email system. That makes him the first major Republican and potential challenger of hers to say so.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cI think she clearly broke the law,\u201d Paul, a likely 2016 GOP presidential candidate, said.\n\nIn fact, she fired one of her ambassadors for not using government email. I think people don\u2019t like hypocrisy. She also has said she did it for convenience because she didn\u2019t want to have two phones\u2014but of course within days she had admitted that she does have two phones. I think convenience, which is her excuse at this point\u2014to carry just one phone\u2014I think that convenience should never trump national security. I think when she says, \u201coh I never transmitted classified information\u201d the problem is is that her schedule is classified. She\u2019s going to tell us she never got her schedule emailed to her? The reason it\u2019s classified is to protect her whereabouts. We wouldn\u2019t want enemies to know where our Secretary of State is at all times. But she also doesn\u2019t just put herself at risk by sending these messages on an unsecured server, she also puts at risk the people who defend her and the people who are responsible for her safety if that schedule were to get out to people who want to harm the Secretary of State.\n\nPaul added that it\u2019s unfathomable that no communications Clinton had on the private email address and server were classified\u2014because, among other reasons, she was communicating via email with President Barack Obama himself.\n\n\u201cThe other possibility is that I think hasn\u2019t been clearly explained yet is she says \u2018well I didn\u2019t ever push send and send classified information,\u2019\u201d Paul said.\n\nIf you want to as a journalist use the Freedom of Information Act to get the conversations between the president and the Secretary of State, what do you think the response is going to be? Most of these conversations are classified. So that\u2019s the thing, she\u2019s going to say she communicated with the president by email but she\u2019s going to assure us that\u2019s not classified? She\u2019s also going to say \u201cI did obey the law here, trust me I went through and I only discarded the things that were non-governmental.\u201d I think this goes to judgment\u2014or her lack of judgment. It\u2019s kind of what I\u2019ve been saying all along about how I think her poor judgment with regard to Benghazi should preclude her [from being president]. This is just another example I think of really poor judgment I think when she is sort of placing herself above the law.\n\nNonetheless, despite the fact Paul says she broke the law, he doesn\u2019t think it will be easy to hold her accountable because she\u2019ll try to use her influence to get off.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019ll stonewall and she\u2019ll stonewall and she\u2019ll try to prevent any release of any of the emails, but I think there needs to be an independent investigation,\u201d Paul said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUSTIN, TX \u2014 Sen.
