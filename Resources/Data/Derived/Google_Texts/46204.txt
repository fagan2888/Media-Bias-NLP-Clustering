Department of Education manages to offend student borrowers with another ill-conceived government meme

As the creators of the Obamacare pajama boy and doge memes can probably attest, attempts to reach Millennials on social media can often go horribly wrong.

The Federal Student Aid office in the U.S. Dept. of Education was the latest federal agency to find that out the hard way.

A Tuesday night tweet from the Federal Student Aid account (@FAFSA) featured a popular photo meme of Kristen Wiig in “Bridesmaids” with a caption, “Help me. I’m poor.” The tweet itself, which has since been deleted, read, “If this is you, then you better fill out your FAFSA.”

The Internet mock machine flew fast at the organization, taking offense to the notion presented in the tweet, as documented by Twitchy.

Unbelievable. Take this down. RT @FAFSA: If this is you, then you better fill out your FAFSA: http://t.co/EOB70Eucam http://t.co/3Y7ilKsqTB — Anne Kress (@MCCPresident) June 25, 2014

The office has since deleted the tweet and apologized in a subsequent tweet.

We apologize for the insensitivity of our previous tweet. Our goal is to make college a reality for all. We're very sorry. — Federal Student Aid (@FAFSA) June 25, 2014

Federal Student Aid is the largest provider of student financial aid with more than 21 million applications submitted each year, according to its website.
