The Indiana University is laying off 50 workers and sending them to a temp agency because of Obamacare.

Indiana University, which currently spends $215 million a year on health care, will shift 50 maintenance and custodial employees to an outside contractor that will hire them and will manage their hours. According to Indiana’s WRTV, the university is doing so to avoid paying for health insurance for the workers — Obamacare will require that all hourly employees who work 30 or more hours a week be provided with “affordable” health insurance.

Graduate students at IU have also fallen victim to Obamacare, as the university will be limiting the number of hours they can work to keep them under the 30-hour threshold as well.
