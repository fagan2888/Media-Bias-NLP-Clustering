We might not have much sympathy for celebrities who fail to make payments. But what about men who are working poor? Should those people, mostly men, many Black men, be incarcerated for this infraction?\n\nIn their report, The New York Times says \u201cthe threat of jail [is] considered an effective incentive for people who are able but unwilling to pay.\u201d\n\nBut critics of this policy believe this incentive traps \u201cpoor men in a cycle of debt, unemployment and imprisonment.\u201d The cycle is believed to begin with the court order that requires the child support payee to pay an amount they cannot afford. Steep child support payments may never be paid or are paid occasionally but not in the full. As time passes, these payments become an incomprehensible amount of debt.\n\nIf the payment is not paid at all or in full, authorities withhold 65 percent of the payee\u2019s paycheck, seize bank accounts and tax refunds, suspend driver and professional licenses and lastly impose jail time.\n\n\u201cParents who are truly destitute go to jail over and over again for child support debt simply because they\u2019re poor. We see many cases in which the person is released, they\u2019re given three months to pay a large amount of money, and then if they can\u2019t do that they\u2019re tossed right back in the county jail,\u201d says Sarah Geraghty, an attorney with the Southern Center for Human Rights. The group recently filed a lawsuit in Georgia for parents who are incarcerated for failing to pay child support but have no legal representation.\n\nThe New York Times says there is no national count of parents who are incarcerated for failing to pay their child support and enforcement to pay varies from state to state. Though, a survey claims in 2009, one in eight inmates in South Carolina was imprisoned for not paying their child support. In 2010, 3,500 parents were been imprisoned in Georgia for this reason, and 1,800 parents were given ankle monitors or jailed in two New Jersey counties during 2013.\n\nIt should also be noted, in some states if the parent who receives child support is on public assistance, the parent who pays child support must pay it back. By paying both child support and welfare reimbursement, most child support payees are not able to live above a practical income level. Therefore, those parents lag behind their bills, rent/mortgage or living expenses adding to their dire financial circumstances.\n\nMany believe people should not conceive children they cannot afford, especially when child support plays a dramatic role in co-parenting. But that rule of thumb does not apply to those who have created children during their marriage. It is believed that Walter Scott, who was shot in the back while fleeing former Police Officer Mike Slager, did so because he didn\u2019t want to have to go back to jail over unpaid child support. He has children conceived both with in and out of wedlock.\n\nTo read the full New York Times article, click here.
