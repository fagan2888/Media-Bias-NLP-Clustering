How have you and other Brownsville leaders been able to pursue the community to pursue a healthier lifestyle?\n\nAt the time, I was a private practitioner who did not regularly vote, so I can\u2019t really say I was in the trenches with policy makers at all. But I got involved in an initiative at the University of Texas School of Public Health here in Brownsville to create a farmers market that would be accessible and affordable to people of all incomes and ages.\n\nFor that initiative I was usually the person who spoke to the city government about permits and that type of thing, so I learned a bit about how policy is made and how funds are allotted. That led me to become interested in getting involved in a political sense because I realized that if designing and opening a farmers market, which should be a simple, very good thing for the community, was so hard and had so much red tape around it, that I needed to have a stronger voice. Otherwise, the voice of wellness was not going to be heard.\n\nBack then the relationship between wellness or age-friendly communities and the economy was not not understood by policy makers. Translating the health data into its economic implications is what began to get folks listening.\n\n\n\n2. Do you remember there being a light bulb moment when you were talking to people and you realized they had got it, at last?\n\nWell, I remember very clearly that as we went from initiative to initiative \u2014 we started with farmers\u2019 markets, then we went on to the Challenge, which is a five-month springtime event for engaging the community in healthy living, and then the CycloBia \u2014 there were fewer and fewer people who stood up and said \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThe rewarding a-ha moment was when that scale tipped and instead of having to make a case and argue for a particular initiative, we received a more enthusiastic welcome. \u201cOh, you have another initiative. OK, what\u2019s it about? How can we get involved?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"DivisionMain": "Division:Livable Communities", "Division1": "Division:Livable Communities", "page_title": "5 Questions for Rose Gowen, M.D.", "Locations": "Locations:Texas", "estimated_publish_date": "2016-01-29", "Last-Modified": "2015-02-03T01:51:22.772-05:00", "keywords": "rose gowen, public health, diabetes, obesity, texas, mexico, border, hispanic, latino, commissioner, age-friendly", "paywallStatus": "off", "livefyreId": "350119:http://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/info-2014/interview-rose-gowen.html", "author": "Natalie Turner", "lfdataConfig": "{\"globalConfig\":{\"network\":\"aarp.fyre.co\"},\"livefyreConfig\":[{\"collectionMeta\":\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJodHRwOi8vd3d3LmFhcnAub3JnL2xpdmFibGUtY29tbXVuaXRpZXMvaW5mby0yMDE0L2ludGVydmlldy1yb3NlLWdvd2VuLmh0bWwiLCJ0aXRsZSI6IjUgUXVlc3Rpb25zIGZvciBSb3NlIEdvd2VuLCBNLkQuIiwidXJsIjoiaHR0cDovL3d3dy5hYXJwLm9yZy9saXZhYmxlLWNvbW11bml0aWVzL2luZm8tMjAxNC9pbnRlcnZpZXctcm9zZS1nb3dlbi5odG1sIiwidGFncyI6IiIsImNoZWNrc3VtIjoiMzIyMjc4MDZkNTAxMzBmOWU1MjllMjZkZTQxODQ2ODgiLCJ0eXBlIjoibGl2ZWNvbW1lbnRzIn0.entjVqET0ncP1TMd6xIGXq1sugCu9vuZb6Bto8COGTM\",\"checksum\":\"32227806d50130f9e529e26de4184688\",\"siteId\":\"350139\",\"articleId\":\"http://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/info-2014/interview-rose-gowen.html\",\"el\":\"livefyreConversation\",\"disableAvatars\":true,\"postToButtons\":[\"tw\",\"fb\"]}]}", "Location1": "Locations:Texas", "source": "livable_communities", "type": "info", "description": "AARP visits with Dr. Rose Gowen, a physician turned city commissioner in Brownsville, Texas", "robots": "index,follow", "Subject1": "Division:Livable Communities", "fb": {"app_id": 114175878660191}, "Subject3": "Division:Livable Communities/Topic A", "viewport": "width=device-width", "language": "english", "og": {"site_name": "AARP", "description": "AARP visits with Dr. Rose Gowen, a physician turned city commissioner in Brownsville, Texas", "title": "Interview with Dr. Rose Gowen, City Commissioner, Brownsville, Texas - AARP", "url": "http://www.aarp.org/livable-communities/info-2014/interview-rose-gowen.html", "image": "http://cdn.aarp.net/content/dam/aarp/livable-communities/images-2014/200-dr-rose-gowan.imgcache.rev1403289985918.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": "/content/aarp/en/home/livable-communities/info-2014/interview-rose-gowen", "mcafeesecure-site-verification": "fa79d1a3c2770869e1286a81816d01a4", "Subject2": "DCSubjects:Health/Healthy Living", "IALevel1": "livable-communities", "IALevel2": "info-2014", "s43": "7.StayinHome|MyFinancialSecurity", "action": "read", "dateToday": "2016-05-26"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd80fb\"", "article_summary": "How have you and other Brownsville leaders been able to pursue the community to pursue a healthier lifestyle?\nBack then the relationship between wellness or age-friendly communities and the economy was not not understood by policy makers.\nOtherwise, the voice of wellness was not going to be heard.\nDo you remember there being a light bulb moment when you were talking to people and you realized they had got it, at last?\nAt the time, I was a private practitioner who did not regularly vote, so I can\u2019t really say I was in the trenches with policy makers at all."}
