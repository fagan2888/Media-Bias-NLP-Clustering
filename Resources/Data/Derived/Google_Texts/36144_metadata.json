The vast majority of physicians are members of independent or solo practices. Even physicians who work exclusively in hospitals, such as emergency physicians, are typically members of small group practices that contract with one or more hospitals to staff their departments. Hospitals typically employ nurses, technicians, and support staff \u2013 but not physicians.\n\nFor the most part, physicians have practice privileges at hospitals, but are neither suppliers, contractors, nor employees of hospitals \u2013 a fact most people don\u2019t realize until they become a hospital patient, and receive separate bills from the hospital, and from every physician who treated them there. It\u2019s almost as if hospitals merely provide a venue for physicians and patients to meet, with the patient paying separately for the physicians\u2019 services and for the use of the meeting place.\n\nThere are a few integrated medical systems, such as Kaiser Permanente (in some states) that have mutually exclusive contracts with a single physicians group, and operate as a single integrated unit \u2013 but this is a small minority of U.S. physicians (and for that matter, a small minority of U.S. hospitals).\n\nIn the 1990s there was a wave of hospital mergers, leading to local near-monopolies of hospital services in some metropolitan areas. Recently, however, many hospital organizations \u2013 particularly those with local near-monopolies \u2013 have been forming physician groups, which have in turn been buying up physician practices at a rapid rate. For example, Inova owns all but two hospitals in the Northern Virginia region, and recently started the Inova Medical Group. Inova Medical Group has acquired numerous office-based physician practices across the region, including over 400 office-based physicians \u2013 as well as primary care and most major specialties.\n\nHospital groups across the country have also started forming their own health insurance companies \u2013 either on their own, or as joint ventures with established insurance companies \u2013 with their own facilities and physicians as the main in-network providers.\n\nThis vertical consolidation of health care appears to be a rational response \u2013 from a business point of view \u2013 to two aspects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nFor the non-Medicare sector of the market, the ACA incentivizes health plans with narrow networks. By forming their own insurance plans with their own facilities and employees as the main in-network providers, they can assure themselves of a patient base, while simultaneously reducing competition at the provider level.\n\nNot only is this encouraged by the ACA\u2019s preference for narrow networks; it is synergistic with the effects of the ACA\u2019s Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP)\n\nThe MSSP establishes the notion of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs). These are groups of providers (hospitals, physicians, other providers) who join together for purposes of a Medicare fee-for-service incentive program. ACOs are paid to \u201creduce costs\u201d for treating their patients. This sounds like a reasonable goal, but the ACO system has a number of odd and unique quirks. First of all, patients don\u2019t \u201cenroll\u201d in an ACO \u2013 they are assigned to an ACO ex post based on the preponderance of their utilization. That is, at the end of the year, if a patient happens to have had a plurality of care (measured by either service counts or dollars of Medicare claims), from physicians who are members of a particular ACO, then that patient is assigned to that ACO.[1] Not only do patients not enroll in ACOs; they might not even be aware of them, as assignments may take place after the fact.\n\nFor patients assigned to ACOs, the ACO receives bonus payments based on the total amount Medicare pays for care of those patients. That total includes all care those patients receive from all providers \u2013 specifically, including providers who are not members of the ACO. Bonuses are based on reducing total costs relative to what would be expected risk-adjusted cost based on each patient\u2019s health status.\n\nBecause this program is part of Medicare\u2019s fee-for-service system, \u201creduce costs\u201d means \u201creduce services\u201d \u2013 that is, \u201cgive patients less care.\u201d\n\nThe idea is to incentivize providers to encourage patients to utilize less care \u2013 say, to recommend fewer surgeries, fewer hospital stays, less frequent follow-up visits, and so on. ACO participants can certainly refer patients to other participants in the same ACO when another type of care is needed, so that the ACO can deal with the patient in a consistent manner.\n\nOne might ask how an ACO is supposed to reduce patients\u2019 utilization of health care in a fee-for-service system in which patients are, in principle, free to obtain services whenever they want from providers outside the ACO\u2019s control \u2013 and indeed, may not even be aware of whether they are in an ACO, let alone what providers are members.\n\nIndeed, this could be very difficult for a small ACO consisting of only a few physicians and one hospital in a large metropolitan area.\n\nHOWEVER \u2013 if an ACO controls a large percentage of the available providers, it gets a lot easier to reduce patient utilization. If an ACO wants to, say, try to limit patients to 12 specialty visits a year, it\u2019s much easier if they \u201cown\u201d most of the specialists in the area. If an ACO includes many of the major hospitals, and a significant number of physicians in every major practice area \u2013 including, say, imaging facilities and labs (possibly a hospital outpatient lab), then it becomes a lot easier to guide patients to the level and type of utilization desired \u2013 which is, for purposes of the Medicare Shared Savings Program, always less utilization. And of course, it is much easier to enforce referral and utilization policies on physicians who are employees of a group running the ACO, rather than simply independent businesses who happen to join an ACO at a given moment in time.\n\nIn other words, the Medicare Shared Savings Program encourages hospitals and physicians of different specialties to join together in order to encourage patients to use less health care.\n\nIt is highly ironic that a law proposed, in part, because of the allegation health insurance companies were increasing their profits by denying care to patients \u2013 is now the means by which the federal government pays physicians to, in effect, deny care to patients.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For the last half-century or longer, one of the most notable features of the U.S. health care system has been the fact that very few physicians are employed by hospitals.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "AAF", "description": "For the last half-century or longer, one of the most notable features of the U.S. health care system has been the fact that very few physicians are employed by hospitals.", "title": "Why Are Hospitals Buying Physician Practices and Forming Insurance Companies? - AAF", "locale": "en_US", "url": "http://www.americanactionforum.org/research/why-are-hospitals-buying-physician-practices-and-forming-insurance-companies/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For the last half-century or longer, one of the most notable features of the U.S. health care system has been the fact that very few physicians are employed by hospitals.", "card": "summary", "title": "Why Are Hospitals Buying Physician Practices and Forming Insurance Companies? - AAF"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#323b4d", "robots": "noodp", "theme-color": "#323b4d", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.americanactionforum.org/wp-content/themes/aaf/images/fav-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "41969DB57D11BA64AEE68EAB043A3E25", "article": {"section": "Health Care"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "These are groups of providers (hospitals, physicians, other providers) who join together for purposes of a Medicare fee-for-service incentive program.\nBonuses are based on reducing total costs relative to what would be expected risk-adjusted cost based on each patient\u2019s health status.\nRecently, however, many hospital organizations \u2013 particularly those with local near-monopolies \u2013 have been forming physician groups, which have in turn been buying up physician practices at a rapid rate.\nThis vertical consolidation of health care appears to be a rational response \u2013 from a business point of view \u2013 to two aspects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\nEven physicians who work exclusively in hospitals, such as emergency physicians, are typically members of small group practices that contract with one or more hospitals to staff their departments."}
