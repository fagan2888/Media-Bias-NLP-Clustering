The agency has said crossing that will necessitate a cut-back on payments to state and local governments.\n\nGOP leaders in the House are proposing a package that relies on $3 billion worth of savings from Transportation Security Administration fees and $5 billion in tax compliance measures to road projects through Dec. 18.\n\nThe Senate, meanwhile, has worked on a longer, six-year, $275 billion transportation funding measure, but lawmakers in the upper chamber have yet not revealed how their legislation would be paid for.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep.

The tax has not been increased since 1993, though, and has struggled to keep pace with construction costs as vehicles have become more fuel-efficient.\n\nThe federal government typically spends about $50 billion per year on transportation projects, but the gas tax only brings in about $34 billion annually at its current rate.\n\nLawmakers have turned to other areas of the federal budget in recent years to close the $16 billion annual gap, but transportation advocates have argued the resulting temporary patches are preventing states from undertaking badly needed large construction projects.\n\nTransportation advocates have pushed Congress to increase the gas tax for the first time in two decades to pay for a long-term infrastructure funding extension, but GOP lawmakers have been reluctant to ask drivers to pay more at the pump.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"User fees must benefit the users who pay them,\" the U.S. Travel Association said.", "description": "\"User fees must benefit the users who pay them,\" the U.S. Travel Association said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\"User fees must benefit the users who pay them,\" the U.S. Travel Association said.", "title": "Travel group to GOP: Don't use TSA fees to pay for highway fix", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/247860-travel-group-to-gop-dont-tap-tsa-fees-for-highway-fix", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/tsa_lax_050211getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-14T14:23:02-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-14T14:23-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/247860-travel-group-to-gop-dont-tap-tsa-fees-for-highway-fix", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-14T14:13-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "U.S. Travel Association, Highway bill, Highway Trust Fund, MAP-21 Reauthorization, Gas Tax, Transportation Security Administration,Roger Dow, Paul Ryan,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-14T14:13:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-14T14:23:02-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/247860-travel-group-to-gop-dont-tap-tsa-fees-for-highway-fix", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\"User fees must benefit the users who pay them,\" the U.S. Travel Association said.", "card": "summary", "title": "Travel group to GOP: Don't use TSA fees to pay for highway fix"}, "dcterms.title": "Travel group to GOP: Don't use TSA fees to pay for highway fix"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde9c0\"", "article_summary": "The Senate, meanwhile, has worked on a longer, six-year, $275 billion transportation funding measure, but lawmakers in the upper chamber have yet not revealed how their legislation would be paid for.\nThe traditional source of transportation funding has been revenue from the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal gas tax.\nADVERTISEMENT\"The travel community has always stood by a very basic precept: user fees must benefit the users who pay them,\" Dow said in a statement.\nHouse Republicans unveiled an approximately $8 billion highway patch Monday evening that includes about $3 billion in \"savings\" from redirecting the TSA fees to the nation's beleaguered Highway Trust Fund, which is currently set to dip below critical levels July 31.\n\"To say it's OK to use TSA fees for surface projects because it's all transportation is just too much of a stretch.\""}
