Rick Perry recently announced plans to send 1,000 National Guard troops to the border to help cope with the flood of young Central Americans crossing into this country illegally, he further fueled a debate within Congress and the Obama administration over the value and risks of such a maneuver.\n\nTo tighten security and staunch the flow of tens of thousands of young people and mothers with children, congressional leaders and the White House are wrestling with a series of proposals, including the deployment of National Guard troops to supplement the work of beleaguered federal immigration and border authorities.\n\nRelated: Perry Tests Obama by Sending Troops to the Border\n\nFor decades, the National Guard has been used for an array of assignments, from assisting in the recovery from floods and other natural disasters to drug trafficking interdiction to lending support to federal officials and agents along the border.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) has repeatedly urged President Obama to send National Guard troops to the border to provide humanitarian assistance and relieve border patrols of some administrative duties.\n\nBoehner and other House Republicans have made clear they do not want the National Guard to help enforce immigration laws or apprehend illegal immigrants, according to a Boehner spokesperson. By contrast, Gov. Perry has been urging Obama for over a month to deploy 1,000 troops to the border and grant them \u201carrest powers to support border patrol operations.\u201d\n\nRelated: Jeb Bush Warns GOP on Immigration Reform\n\nThe New York Times reported late last week that by deploying troops himself instead of through the president, Perry \u201chas the power to order the troops to make arrests and apprehensions, something Guard troops in past border deployments have been prohibited from doing.\u201d\n\nThe Times report has triggered concerns from immigration rights advocates and some military and legal experts that troops deployed along the border without proper training and a clear mandate and chain of command could be a recipe for disaster \u2013 one that could violate the civil rights of the illegal immigrants or even lead to deadly confrontations.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a stunt, quite honestly,\u201d Daniel Costa, director of Immigration Law and Policy Research at the Economic Policy Institute, said in an interview on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s questionable whether they\u2019ll be able to do anything.\u201d\n\nSome local sheriffs are questioning the order as well. Hidalgo County Sheriff Eddie Guerra told the McAllen Monitor Guard troops can\u2019t make arrests and he didn\u2019t know what their objective would be, according to MSNBC. \u201cThe National Guard \u2013 they\u2019re trained in warfare; they\u2019re not trained in law enforcement,\u201d said Guerra. \u201cI need to find out what their actual role is going to be, but I think the money would be better spent giving local law enforcement more funds.\u201d\n\nJayson P. Ahern, a former Customs and Border Protection acting commissioner, told The Fiscal Times, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any plan other than just a press announcement from Gov. Perry, so I don\u2019t know what their plan is.\u201d\n\nRelated: Wave of Migrant Children Threatens to Swamp U.S. Immigration Courts\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s hard for me to fathom how they can even support that mission because it hasn\u2019t been coordinated and hasn\u2019t been approved\u201d by the Department of Homeland Security, Defense Department and or border patrol officials, said Ahern, who helped coordinate the deployment of 6,000 troops to four border states in 2006, during the administration of President George W. Bush.\n\nAhern, now a principal at The Chertoff Group, a global security and risk-management advisory firm, stressed the complexity of patrolling the borders and the need for well-trained officers who are familiar with the terrain and who have been deployed for a significant period of time.\n\n\u201cIf you start to add in unfamiliar assets [like National Guard troops] that are not under the supervision and control of the Border Patrol, I see that as potentially a hazard and a safety issue,\u201d he added.\n\nIt is still unclear whether Gov. Perry \u2013 a potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate \u2013 will actually invoke the power to send in armed troops to make arrests and apprehensions along the border between Texas and Mexico.\n\nPresidents have shied away from such actions in the past. When Bush deployed 6,000 troops in 2006, those troops were used primarily to repair and build fences, undertake surveillance and handle other administrative chores, according to Ahern.\n\nObama also declined to grant arrest and apprehension powers to the 1,200 troops he deployed along the border in 2010 to enhance security, according to The New York Times report.\n\nJust the threat of Perry sending in troops with marching orders to enforce civilian law in tandem with Texas state police officers has prompted outcries from immigrant rights groups. Fernando Garcia, executive director of the Border Network for Human Rights, told The New York Times, \u201cIt\u2019s going to complicate the scenario of civil and human rights at the border.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration said Thursday that a team of military and national security analysts was being sent to the Texas border \u201cto determine whether there is a productive role for the National Guard in response to the crisis,\u201d according to The Washington Post.\n\nWhite House officials indicated on Friday there was scant hope Congress would reach agreement on an emergency package of funding and measures to address the border crisis before lawmakers leave on a five-week recess at the end of this week, The Washington Post reported. House Republicans now say they\u2019re willing to support only about $1 billion of the $3.7 billion of emergency funding and authority Obama has requested.\n\n\u201cIt is my hope that Speaker Boehner and House Republicans will not leave town for the month of August for their vacations without doing something to help solve this problem,\u201d Obama said as he met at the White House with the presidents of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to discuss the crisis.\n\nTop Reads From the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Texas Gov.
