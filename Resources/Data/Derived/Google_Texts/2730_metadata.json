Evidently that maxim fails to apply when a business isn\u2019t anti-union enough.\n\nWorkers at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., are voting this week on whether or not to join the United Auto Workers. Far from attempting to prevent its workers from unionizing, Volkswagen is offering its support, saying \"Volkswagen America is committed to defending our employees' legal right to make a free choice.\" And that seems to have driven Republicans into a fit of madness.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Republican Party.]\n\nFor starters, state lawmakers have said that the hefty package of tax incentives they dumped into Volkswagen\u2019s lap to entice the company to build in Tennessee could be at risk if the plant unionizes. \"It has been widely reported that Volkswagen has promoted a campaign that has been unfair, unbalanced and, quite frankly, un-American in the traditions of American labor campaigns,\" said Republican state Sen. Bo Watson. \"Should the workers choose to be represented by the United Auto Workers, then I believe additional incentives for expansion will have a very tough time passing the Tennessee Senate.\"\n\nUsually I\u2019d consider it a good thing that a state was rethinking the buckets of corporate tax incentives it doles out, since they do little to promote economic growth or job creation. But it\u2019s anti-union animus, not economics, driving this discussion.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just state lawmakers voicing their displeasure with Volkswagen: Conservative groups have poured into Tennessee, buying up billboards saying, among other things, that Chattanooga will turn into bankrupt Detroit if the UAW is successful.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the economy.]\n\nBut the lead anti-union crusader has been U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the former mayor of Chattanooga. In addition to lambasting the UAW, Corker has said \u2013 in contradiction to the company\u2019s public announcements \u2013 that Volkswagen will reward workers with a new product to build if they decide not to unionize. \"I've had conversations today and based on those am assured that should the workers vote against the UAW, Volkswagen will announce in the coming weeks that it will manufacture its new mid-size SUV here in Chattanooga,\" said Corker. As Reuters reported, labor law experts believe Corker\u2019s statement could very well be an illegal attempt to intimidate workers.\n\nAll in all, this is a lot of GOP meddling with a private business. \"In my 20 years on the hill, I've never seen such a massive intrusion into the affairs of a private company,\" said Tennessee Democratic state Rep. Craig Fitzhugh. Indeed, usually it's Republicans decrying any attempt by government to regulate the unionization process. So what on Earth is going on?\n\nWell, a plant unionized by the UAW in Tennessee could potentially deal a blow to the right-wing narrative that anti-union companies in so-called \u201cright to work\u201d states are better for economic growth and job creation by providing a real-time counterpoint. If unions make inroads into foreign-owned auto plants in the South, the right-wing effort to claim that unions are something that ails business will be undermined. (Since Tennessee is right to work, employees in Chattanooga could still opt out of supporting the union even if the plant unionizes.)\n\n[Read the U.S. News debate: Are 'Right-to-Work' Laws Good for States?]\n\nAlready, there\u2019s much more myth than meat to the right to work movement. As the Economic Policy Institute has found, right to work laws \u2013 which undercut unions by allowing workers to free-load off union contracts \u2013 \u201creduce wages by $1,500 a year, for both union and nonunion workers.\u201d They also make it less likely that workers will receive health care benefits and more likely that workplace accidents will occur. And they have no appreciable impact on job growth.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Volkswagen Drives Anti-Union Republicans Crazy in Tennessee", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Republicans are going all-out to prevent a Volkswagen plant from unionizing.", "title": "The GOP Gets All Up in Volkswagen's Business", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/pat-garofalo/2014/02/13/volkswagen-drives-anti-union-republicans-crazy-in-tennessee", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/74/2b/6b3b90d94b29bdb27df218d9e287/140213-volkswagen-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Volkswagen Drives Anti-Union Republicans Crazy in Tennessee", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "description": "Republicans are going all-out to prevent a Volkswagen plant from unionizing."}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Feb. 13, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Pat Garofalo,unions,labor,cars,UAW,car manufacturers,Tennessee,Corker, Bob,picks,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Republicans are going all-out to prevent a Volkswagen plant from unionizing."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf338\"", "article_summary": "Workers at a Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., are voting this week on whether or not to join the United Auto Workers.\n(Since Tennessee is right to work, employees in Chattanooga could still opt out of supporting the union even if the plant unionizes.)\nFar from attempting to prevent its workers from unionizing, Volkswagen is offering its support, saying \"Volkswagen America is committed to defending our employees' legal right to make a free choice.\"\nRepublicans like to say that they want to get government off the back of business.\nBut the lead anti-union crusader has been U.S. Sen.
