Also another thing to do, in your crawl spaces, if you have any openings to go ahead and get those sealed off. Insulate your pipes because the cold weather and the cold air coming through your crawl spaces can definitely freeze those pipes pretty quick.\"\n\nAnd to avoid a broken main which can lead to flooding, Lucas says turn on faucets--either to a slow drip or steady stream.\n\n\"It allows that water to keep flowing so it can't have time to build up and burst your pipes inside your house,\" he said.\n\nHomeowners are also encouraged to keep the heat in their homes on at all times. Even if they go out of town, they can turn it down, but not completely off.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "When the first cold snap of the year rolls through KAKEland, plumbers say they get bombarded with calls, usually about frozen or burst pipes.", "language": "english", "author": "Madeline Anderson", "og": {"description": "When the first cold snap of the year rolls through KAKEland, plumbers say they get bombarded with calls, usually about frozen or burst pipes.", "title": "Tips to avoid frozen pipes during cold snap", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Tips-to-avoid-frozen-pipes-during-cold-snap--352757531.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/FBE/B5A/FBEB5AD005D74674ABCBE853AAB5C161", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/EE2/AE5/EE2AE5B269F247149C78E3BC15E08BB1.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "When the first cold snap of the year rolls through KAKEland, plumbers say they get bombarded with calls, usually about frozen or burst pipes.", "title": "Tips to avoid frozen pipes during cold snap", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Tips-to-avoid-frozen-pipes-during-cold-snap--352757531.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/frozen+pipes6.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Tips to avoid frozen pipes during cold snap", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Tips to avoid frozen pipes"}, "article_summary": "Insulate your pipes because the cold weather and the cold air coming through your crawl spaces can definitely freeze those pipes pretty quick.\"\nWhen the first cold snap of the year rolls through KAKEland, plumbers say they get bombarded with calls, usually about frozen or burst pipes.\n\"It allows that water to keep flowing so it can't have time to build up and burst your pipes inside your house,\" he said.\n\"Disconnect their hose from their hose bib outside of their house,\" Lucas said.\n\"Anytime it gets cold, you want to prepare for the worst,\" said Jeremy Lucas, a service technician with Mr. Rooter."}
