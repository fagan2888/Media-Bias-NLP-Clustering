Tom Dowd said appeared to be at least 50 years old, floating on the east side of the city-managed reservoir dam, clothed in pants and a shirt.\n\nDowd said police aren't sure how long the man was in the water before the cyclist found him, but did note that \"there were no obvious signs of foul play.\"\n\nThe reservoir remained open throughout the recovery process, and recreational boaters remained on the lake as a fire safety boat was keeping the curious away from the recovery site.\n\nThe Boulder County Coroner and city detectives were investigating the incident. No additional details have been released.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28800073/body-found-floating-boulder-reservoir-by-passing-cyclist", "sailthru.author": "By Alex Burness and Charlie Brennan, Staff Writers", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28800073:view"}, "startDate": "2015-09-12T13:04:05-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Police and fire personnel were deployed Saturday afternoon at the Boulder Reservoir on the grim task of retrieving a body that was first spotted floating in the water by a passing cyclist.", "title": "Man's body found floating in Boulder Reservoir by passing cyclist", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28800073/body-found-floating-boulder-reservoir-by-passing-cyclist", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0912/20150912_023859_bodyinlake.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Boulder News", "modificationDate": "2015-09-12T19:06:11-0600", "endDate": "2025-09-12T13:04:05-0600", "news_keywords": "Boulder News, Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado Boulder News news, Boulder Colorado news, Boulder News Boulder news, Boulder News Colorado news, US Boulder News news, world Boulder News news.", "byline": "By Alex Burness", "pubDate": "2015-09-12T13:08:00-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-12T13:04:05-0600", "sailthru.title": "Man's body found floating in Boulder Reservoir by passing cyclist", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0912/20150912_023859_bodyinlake_300.jpg", "description": "Police and fire personnel were deployed Saturday afternoon at the Boulder Reservoir on the grim task of retrieving a body that was first spotted floating in the water by a passing cyclist.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_28800073/body-found-floating-boulder-reservoir-by-passing-cyclist", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Police and fire personnel were deployed Saturday afternoon at the Boulder Reservoir on the grim task of retrieving a body that was first spotted floating in the water by a passing cyclist.", "title": "Man's body found floating in Boulder Reservoir by passing cyclist"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0912/20150912_023859_bodyinlake.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf07f\"", "article_summary": "Police and fire personnel were deployed Saturday afternoon at the Boulder Reservoir on the grim task of retrieving a man's body that was first spotted floating in the water by a passing cyclist.\nThey responded to the east side of the reservoir, along the dirt road that splits off from Reservoir Road just before the Boulder County Regional Fire Training Center.\nThe reservoir remained open throughout the recovery process, and recreational boaters remained on the lake as a fire safety boat was keeping the curious away from the recovery site.\nUpon arrival, they spotted a man, who Boulder Sgt.\nTom Dowd said appeared to be at least 50 years old, floating on the east side of the city-managed reservoir dam, clothed in pants and a shirt."}
