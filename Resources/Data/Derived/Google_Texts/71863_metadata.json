Not repealing President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, though the conservative campaign to undermine the law will proceed in the background. Instead, Republicans dangled the prospect of fast-track trade agreements and sweeping tax reform as potential areas of agreement during Obama\u2019s waning days in office.\n\nEven before voters went to the polls Tuesday, McConnell and Boehner, R-Ohio, began mapping this coordinated strategy in hopes of unifying Republicans, picking up support from some Democratic lawmakers and putting pressure on Obama to compromise or risk drawing his own charges of obstructionism.\n\nTHE PRESS IS ON\n\nAccording to three Republicans who requested anonymity to speak freely about the talks, Boehner and McConnell plan to roll that agenda out over the next few weeks in a series of joint appearances, joint memos and joint op-ed articles \u2013 including in The Wall Street Journal on Thursday \u2013 promoting their decision to work together.\n\n\u201cOur fortunes are tied,\u201d said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., who chairs the Senate Republican conference. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to hang together and that approach starts at the top with Mitch and Boehner.\u201d\n\nAdded Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a Republican Senate that wants to govern.\u201d\n\nAt the center of these discussions is a desire to avoid the kind of intra-party drama that has roiled Washington since 2011, when Republicans took control of the House with a freshman class dominated by tea-party conservatives.\n\nElated by Tuesday\u2019s election results, Republicans remain burdened by the shutdown of the federal government last year, which sullied the party\u2019s brand. And they still face the prospect of managing an unruly right-flank more interested in challenging Obama than in following leadership\u2019s playbook.\n\nPressure to follow through on the party\u2019s most conservative priorities was already building Wednesday. Several tea party leaders gathered at the National Press Club and reiterated their demand that repealing the Affordable Care Act remain the party\u2019s priority. In a memo, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, also emphasized the health-care law as a top target.\n\n\u201cNow is the time to go after and do everything humanly possible to repeal Obamacare,\u201d Cruz said late Tuesday.\n\nEven the National Review, a magazine popular with the conservative elite, warned McConnell to not forget the activists and grassroots conservatives who lifted him to power.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect to the senator and like-minded Republicans, this course of action makes no sense as a spolitical strategy,\u201d the editors wrote. Though tax reform and trade are good ideas, they wrote, \u201cvoters are not, in fact, waiting anxiously for any of this. Business lobbies are.\u201d\n\nBut other Republicans said McConnell and Boehner face a political imperative to establish themselves as leaders.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real incentive to put things on the president\u2019s desk that are reasonable,\u201d said Glenn Hubbard, the chief economist in the George W. Bush White House. \u201cHe may not sign them all. But the hope is he would sign some of them.\u201d\n\nBOEHNER\u2019S HOUSE STURDY\n\nIn the House, where GOP leaders have been plagued by conservative defectors, Boehner stands a good chance of consolidating his authority given his gains at the polls, said Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C.. Republicans will number at least 243 in January \u2013 a gain of 14 \u2013 the biggest House GOP majority since the Truman administration.\n\nBoehner \u201ccan sell himself as someone who was able to win and who is able to work with the Republican Senate,\u201d Burr said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to hopefully create some more trust among people in the House and create a desire to govern.\u201d\n\nManaging the new Senate majority could also be a challenge. In addition to Cruz, McConnell faces the prospect of as many as 24 Republican senators running for re-election or retiring in 2016. Many, such as Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio, will be running in purple states and possibly be reluctant to take tough votes.\n\nOn the other hand, the class of Senate Republicans elected Tuesday may make McConnell\u2019s job easier. Confidantes say McConnell so far has few concerns about the newcomers and believes most are inclined to work with him. Several were able to overcome tea-party insurgents in the primaries, and therefore do not fear the wrath of activists as much as some Capitol Hill veterans.\n\n\u201cYou know, I think the gridlock is going to end,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said in an interview Wednesday. \u201cSenator McConnell knows how to make the Senate work and I think he\u2019ll make us a bigger party, a better party, by \u2026 crafting bipartisan legislation.\u201d\n\nFIREBRANDS TOLD TO CHILL\n\nPaul, who is widely expected to seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, warned that conservative firebrands in both chambers should not expect the new GOP Senate to pursue an aggressive agenda on every front.\n\n\u201cThe House needs to realize that to pass anything, we\u2019ll need 60 votes in the Senate and getting there is the obstacle,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, the very Democrats most likely to vote with Republicans were the ones who fell to defeat on Tuesday. With moderate Democrats such as Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mark Begich of Alaska and Mark Udall of Colorado gone, Republicans will find a much smaller pool of potential allies when they reach across the aisle.\n\nTo overcome that hurdle, Republicans plan to advance narrow legislation that already has some Democratic support. While pursuing a quixotic campaign to repeal the Affordable Care Act, for example, GOP leaders are discussing more limited efforts to undermine the law, such as watering down a requirement that employers offer full-time workers coverage, which takes effect in January. The administration has already delayed portions of the mandate.\n\nThey could also try to change the definition of a full-time worker from someone who works at least 30 hours a week to someone who works at least 40 hours a week, another proposal likely to draw Democratic support.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though pressured by the right, John Boehner and Mitch McConnell may be more effective with a less-ideological agenda.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Though pressured by the right, John Boehner and Mitch McConnell may be more effective with a less-ideological agenda.", "title": "Republican game plan: Action on Keystone XL, taxes \u2013 then go for big score - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/533598_AP110413033199.jpg", "height": 681}, "updated_time": "2014-11-06T13:36:40-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/11/06/republican-game-plan-action-on-stalled-bills-then-going-for-big-score/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Though pressured by the right, John Boehner and Mitch McConnell may be more effective with a less-ideological agenda.", "title": "Republican game plan: Action on Keystone XL, taxes \u2013 then go for big score - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/533598_AP110413033199.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "News", "published_time": "2014-11-06T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-06T13:36:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddb74\"", "article_summary": "On the other hand, the class of Senate Republicans elected Tuesday may make McConnell\u2019s job easier.\n\u201cThere will be no government shutdowns,\u201d said the Senate majority leader-in-waiting, McConnell of Kentucky.\n\u201cOur fortunes are tied,\u201d said Sen.
