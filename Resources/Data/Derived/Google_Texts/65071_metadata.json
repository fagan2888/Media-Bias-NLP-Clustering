As Michael Grunwald points out at Politico, that\u2019s \u201clarger than the annual budget for NASA, or that of the Interior Department and EPA combined[.]\u201d And the shortfall is entirely due to the changes Barack Obama has made to student-loan programs \u2014 and could grow to ten times that amount over the next decade:\n\nIn obscure data tables buried deep in its 2016 budget proposal, the Obama administration revealed this week that its student loan program had a $21.8 billion shortfall last year, apparently the largest ever recorded for any government credit program. The main cause of the shortfall was President Barack Obama\u2019s recent efforts to provide relief for borrowers drowning in student debt, reforms that have already begun to reduce loan payments to the government. For more than two decades, budget analysts have recalculated the projected costs of about 120 credit programs every year, but they have never lowered their expectations of repayments this dramatically. \u2026 That\u2019s a big quasi-bailout, increasing the deficit nearly 5 percent. The White House budget office was unaware of any larger re-estimates since the current scoring rules for credit programs went into effect in 1992. As a January Politico Magazine feature on the government\u2019s unusual credit portfolio reported, the Federal Housing Administration has stuck more than $75 billion worth of similar re-estimates onto Uncle Sam\u2019s tab over the last two decades, most of them after the recent housing bust led to a cascade of FHA-backed mortgage defaults. But it\u2019s never had a one-year shortfall quite as drastic as this. It\u2019s not yet clear whether this will be a hefty one-time revision, or a harbinger of oceans of red ink as millions more borrowers get relief on their payments to the government. Several reports by Barclays Capital have warned that Obama\u2019s generosity to borrowers could leave the student loan program as much as $250 billion in the hole over the next decade. And behind closed doors, officials in the White House budget office and the Treasury Department have criticized the Education Department\u2019s loan models as overly optimistic, with some officials pushing internally for third-party audits.\n\nWait, what? You can\u2019t get something for nothing? Color me shocked, shocked to find out that having the government take over student loans and then increase their lending by 44% in the past two years produced a flood of red ink.\n\nRecall that Obama insisted on a government takeover of the student-loan industry because banks weren\u2019t lending generously enough for Obama\u2019s tastes and were profiting too much off of government guarantees. In FY2008, the budget for the Direct Loan program was $500 million. Now that the DLP is the only game in town, the annual shortfall in DLP is 430 times the annual budget in FY2008. Think about that for a moment. This is why lending programs work best when the stakeholders can\u2019t just print their own money.\n\nThis comes up at a very bad time for the next Obama giveaway, \u201cfree\u201d community college education. The White House tried to claim that the program would \u201conly\u201d cost $60 billion over the next decade, while serving 9 million students. However, the average tuition for 9 million students would put the actual cost at $34 billion each year, and that\u2019s assuming that the flood of government subsidies doesn\u2019t push demand and price up significantly, just as the student-loan takeover did.\n\nOh, and that $22 billion will go directly against the deficit, and Congress can\u2019t do anything about it, as it\u2019s structured as an entitlement. What they can do is take money out of Obama\u2019s other programs to cover the gap, and that\u2019s exactly what they should do \u2014 while explaining very loudly why it\u2019s necessary, and why we need to end this \u201cquasi-bailout\u201d of the university system forthwith.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cThat\u2019s a big quasi-bailout.\u201d", "title": "Obama\u2019s student-loan program $22 billion in the hole for FY2015", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/02/05/obamas-student-loan-program-22-billion-in-the-hole-for-fy2015/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-05T13:41:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-05T13:38:32+00:00"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, community college, deficit, free stuff, FY2016 budget, student loans,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd52f\"", "article_summary": "Obama\u2019s student-loan program $22 billion in the hole for FY2015posted at 8:41 am on February 5, 2015 by Ed MorrisseyIn the federal budget, just how big a hole would $22 billion be?\nSeveral reports by Barclays Capital have warned that Obama\u2019s generosity to borrowers could leave the student loan program as much as $250 billion in the hole over the next decade.\nIn FY2008, the budget for the Direct Loan program was $500 million.\nThe White House tried to claim that the program would \u201conly\u201d cost $60 billion over the next decade, while serving 9 million students.\nOh, and that $22 billion will go directly against the deficit, and Congress can\u2019t do anything about it, as it\u2019s structured as an entitlement."}
