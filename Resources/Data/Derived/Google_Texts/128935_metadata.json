Organizations are scaling back and cutting corners throughout the many stages of care. In an attempt to save money, some hospitals are experimenting with a rep-less medical device sales model.\n\nIn the traditional model, a medical device sales rep from the implant manufacturer is present during procedures to guide and consult the surgeon. In the rep-less model, surgeons don\u2019t receive support from the manufacturer.\n\nSeveral medical device manufacturers and health systems including the Loma Linda University Medical Center, Royal Oak Medical Devices, and Wright Medical are piloting rep-less programs. Hospitals can purchase implants at about half the cost when they forgo the help from a medical device sales rep.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough some believe these programs will slowly replace device sales reps over the next few years, reps are still very much needed in health systems to deliver quality care.\n\nHere are a few reasons why the rep-less sales model won\u2019t work in today\u2019s health care system:\n\nKnowledge and experience\n\nMedical device sales reps play a critical role in the OR. Their extensive knowledge of the devices they sell allows them to consult with surgeons and provide clinical benefit. A medical sales device rep also sets up product trays with hundreds of instruments to deliver to the OR before the procedure.\n\nWhile physician specialists are the experts in their medical field, the medical device sales rep is the expert on their products. Their attention to detail and specialized experience makes procedures safer and more efficient for patients. The rep acts as an extra safety net in the OR in case there is a complication or problem with the device or implant.\n\nUnrealistic cost reductions\n\nIn order for the process to work without a medical device sales rep, hospital staff need to be trained to assist the surgeon with the devices in the OR. But training is expensive, especially considering the time to train \u2014 time staff could be spending completing their regular responsibilities.\n\nIn addition, procedures without a rep will likely take more time in the OR. The newly trained hospital staff member won\u2019t have the same amount of experience and familiarity with devices and will likely take more time to do the same job. Using less experienced staff may also lead to poor outcomes, readmissions, and secondary procedures. Considering these factors, any potential cost-savings from a repless model won\u2019t add up to much.\n\nTraining headaches\n\nIn a university or teaching hospital setting, training staff members on devices gets complicated. Professionals and students with different levels of experience are coming in and out of the health system, and making sure everyone is on the same page is a challenge.\n\nIn addition, the turnover rate for hospital staff will make keeping up with training difficult. Training for devices will become a continuous effort that isn\u2019t feasible for busy hospitals in an overburdened healthcare system.\n\nStaff shortage\n\nIn the wake of the Affordable Care Act, more patients are seeking care, but there aren\u2019t enough physicians to provide that care. In a report published in November 2013, the Health Resources and Services Administration predicted a shortage of 20,400 primary care providers if the delivery system for primary care remains the same.\n\nWith the shortage of providers, additional responsibilities are falling on the shoulders of nurse practitioners, nurses, and other hospital staff. Without the medical device sales rep, overworked hospital staff have one more thing they need to worry about. Frustrated staff may walk out the door for opportunities with organizations that still use medical device sales reps.\n\nPatient choice\n\nThe new healthcare model empowers patients to take a greater role in their own care. Patients who are more involved in their health want choices to personalize their treatment. But the rep-less model requires hospitals to cut the choices they can offer patients.\n\nHealth systems testing the model contract with a single company to buy implants. Patients and doctors no longer have a choice and automatically receive the implant the contracted manufacturer offers. In this model, care becomes more standardized, moving away from the new healthcare model focused on individualized care.\n\nWhat do you think? Will the medical device sales rep disappear?\n\nPhoto: iStock photo", "article_metadata": {"description": "Removing device sales reps won\u2019t work in today\u2019s health care system.
