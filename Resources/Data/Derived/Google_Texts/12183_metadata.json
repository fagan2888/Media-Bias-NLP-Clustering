REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol (FRANCE - Tags: POLITICS ANNIVERSARY CONFLICT) - RTR3SHVB\n\n4221236\n\nObamacare plans are controlling costs by limiting patients\u2019 access to more expensive \u2014 and possibly more effective \u2014 drugs, according to revelations made at a Capitol Hill hearing Thursday.\n\nPlans on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchanges are \u201climiting the formulary\u201d of drugs provided to patients to exclude expensive treatments for diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, according to House Energy and Commerce subcommittee testimony Thursday from William F. Harvey, government affairs committee chairman at the American College of Rheumatology.\n\n\u201cSimilar to ongoing changes to provider networks, another rampant practice that has been in existence for some time, but has now increased within exchange plans, is changes in formulary coverage of medications,\u201d Harvey stated in prepared testimony.\n\nHarvey explained that some medications derived from living organisms, called \u201cbiologics,\u201d are essential to combating some diseases including Hepatitis C and have no \u201cviable alternatives\u201d among inexpensive medications. Harvey explained that biologics used for rheumatoid arthritis run between $15,000 and $30,000 annually in cost.\n\n\u201cThat cost, while arguably justified by the manufacturer, invariably gets passed on to patients and insurers covering their care,\u201d Harvey testified.\n\n\u201cA ubiquitous tool employed by all payers, except Medicare, is to negotiate prices for drugs with the manufacturer in exchange for preferred status on that insurer\u2019s formulary [a \u2018formulary\u2019 is the list of medicines a manufacturer offers]. The insurer then creates financial disincentives, ranging from non-coverage to excessive co-insurance to restrict use of the more expensive, non-formulary alternatives.\u201d\n\nObamacare exchanges are \u201climiting the formulary\u201d to prevent patients from getting their hands on expensive biologics, and cheaper drugs must fail first before Obamacare customers are even allowed to get access to higher-quality treatments, he said.\n\n\u201cStep therapy and \u2018must fail first\u2019 policies are the norm amongst payers across the spectrum both within and outside of ACA exchanges,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cEven when an individual fails the formulary treatment, barriers to accessing non-formulary alternatives are difficult to overcome. As insurers within various tiers of the exchange plans seek to control costs, limiting the formulary remains and effective and often used tool.\u201d\n\nHarvey called for Congress to moderately restrict Obamacare plans\u2019 ability to limit the formulary.\n\nAs The Daily Caller reported, the Obama administration also instituted an \u201cacademic detailing\u201d program that sends government advisers into doctors\u2019 offices to recommend drugs on the market that can be sold on the Obamacare exchanges, creating concern that cheaper drugs are being recommended to control costs.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "Obama's health-care law leading to prescription of inferior drugs", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Obamacare plans are controlling costs by limiting patients' access to more expensive -- and possibly more effective -- drugs, according to revelations made at a Capitol Hill hearing Thursday.
