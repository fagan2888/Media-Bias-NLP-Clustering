The decision to go forward with the plan was approved behind closed doors and deemed illegal by some. In a two-day mediation, archaeologists, preservationists, and MDM Development agreed to enclose small portions of what remains of the largest ancient village ever found in Florida.\n\nA complaint filed against the City of Miami by William J. Pestle, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Department of Anthropology, University of Miami, states the mediation agreement is null and void, as it ignored Florida\u2019s Sunshine Law, which requires certain government meetings remain open to the public. Pestle said the city commissioners invented this mediation process to exclude the public. \u201cThat was illegal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe parties involved in the mediation were gagged from making any public comment, there were no minutes or any record at all; it\u2019s peculiar. This stinks to heaven.\u201d\n\nBefore the mediation, the Preservation Board continually ruled in favor of preserving the site, Pestle said. Ralf Brookes, Pestle\u2019s attorney, said, \u201cThe Historic and Environmental Preservation Board meetings showed that public opinion was overwhelmingly in favor of preservation. This mediation process had no precedent, no legal basis, and\u2026 we allege violated Florida\u2019s Sunshine Law.\u201d\n\nThe Tequesta site, which is often referred to as \u201cThe Birthplace of Miami,\u201d was situated where the mouth of the Miami River meets Biscayne Bay. Last fall, Robert S. Carr, executive director of the Archaeological and Historical Conservancy for Florida, began to uncover the nine circles ranging from 21 to 41 feet in diameter. The circles are comprised of hundreds of post holes that were cut into the limestone with shells. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have metal tools, so they used conch shells to hollow out the holes. We made shell tools and they could actually cut stone,\u201d Carr said.\n\nRELATED: Historic Importance of Tequesta Village Site in Florida Becoming Clear", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of the most well preserved Native villages in North America, where the Tequesta lived in Florida for 2,000 years, may soon be buried under a hotel", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/20/illegal-decision-puts-tequesta-native-village-site-under-hotel-154935", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/tequesta-site-overall.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Illegal Decision Puts Tequesta Native Village Site Under Hotel"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Illegal Decision Puts Tequesta Native Village Site Under Hotel"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/20/illegal-decision-puts-tequesta-native-village-site-under-hotel-154935", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "dcterms.date": "2014-05-20T10:00-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Native American History, Archaeological Site, Seminole, Florida", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Illegal Decision Puts Tequesta Native Village Site Under Hotel"}, "article_summary": "RELATED: Historic Importance of Tequesta Village Site in Florida Becoming Clear\nThis stinks to heaven.\u201dBefore the mediation, the Preservation Board continually ruled in favor of preserving the site, Pestle said.\nThe decision to go forward with the plan was approved behind closed doors and deemed illegal by some.\nOne of the most well preserved Native villages in North America, where the Tequesta lived in Florida for 2,000 years, may soon be found beneath a luxurious hotel and entertainment center.\nIn a two-day mediation, archaeologists, preservationists, and MDM Development agreed to enclose small portions of what remains of the largest ancient village ever found in Florida."}
