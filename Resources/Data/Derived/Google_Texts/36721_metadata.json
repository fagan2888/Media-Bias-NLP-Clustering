(By Jenna Esarey, special to The Courier-Journal) July 25, 2015\n\nAn eyesore will become art as a damaged tree in Jeffersonville\u2019s Steamboat Park is being transformed into a representation of steamboat stacks.\n\nThe Tall Stacks Tree Art project kicked off Saturday with a picnic and meet and greet with the artist in the park in the Port Fulton Neighborhood at the intersection of Chestnut and Division Streets.\n\nMayor Mike Moore, city council members, Public Art Director Dawn Spyker, and the artist, Joe Autry, were on hand with images of the concept art for the project and examples of Autry\u2019s previous projects.\n\nThe Port Fulton Neighborhood Association provided barbecue, chips, and watermelon for guests at the event kickoff.\n\nAutry works with wood, stone, bronze and ice, participating in ice sculpting competitions in Russia multiple times.\n\nIn 2012 Autry completed a project at a residence along Jeffersonville\u2019s Utica Pike, turning a dead tree into a stylized totem.\n\nUsing everything from chainsaws to delicate chisels Autry will transform the two trunks of the large tree into steamboat stacks, complete with belching smoke and a number of steamboat related images.\n\nWorking Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Autry expects the project to take up to four weeks. The Jeffersonville Art Commission\u2019s Facebook page will update the progress regularly and post when Autry is working. \u201cI expect I\u2019ll be here by 9 a.m. and work about four hours unless the weather is really nice and I\u2019m really in a groove,\u201d Autry said.\n\nVisitors are welcome to watch the work in progress. A safe viewing area has been set up and the public is invited to bring chairs or blankets to spread out under a large, shady tree to watch Autry at work.\n\nThe $8,000 project is funded by grants from the Indiana Art Commission and a Redevelopment Neighborhood Grant given to Port Fulton Neighborhood Association. The Jeffersonville Public Art Commission chipped in as well.\n\n\u201cWe focused on downtown early on because of the walking bridge,\u201d said Nathan Samuel, city council member and leader of the Jeffersonville Public Art Commission. \u201cNow we need to look at other areas.\u201d\n\nThe Port Fulton Neighborhood is only about a mile from the Big Four Bridge and sees a lot of bicycle and automobile traffic. \u201cWe\u2019d like to make everything in the park art related,\u201d said city council member Mike Smith, a life-long resident of the neighborhood. \u201cWe want people to say, \u2018have you seen that place?\u2019.\u201d\n\nSteamboats played a significant role in the history of Port Fulton. Originally a separate town, Port Fulton was formed in 1835 and named after the inventor of the steamboat, Robert Fulton.\n\nThe Howard family, owners of the Howard Shipyards, built their mansion, now the Howard Steamboat Museum, in the town in the late 1800s. The small town was also home to Jefferson General Hospital, the third largest Civil War hospital in the country. Jeffersonville annexed the area in 1926.\n\nAutry lived in the neighborhood for a few years as a child and is excited to create a project there. \u201cI have fond memories of this place,\u201d he said. \u201cI popped my first wheelie on the sidewalk right over there. This neighborhood had a huge impact on my life.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1S1Hcho", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Damaged Jeff trees to be carved into art as part of the Tall Stacks Tree Art project", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Damaged Jeff trees to be carved into art as part of the Tall Stacks Tree Art project", "title": "Damaged Jeff trees to be carved into art", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2015/07/25/damaged-jeff-trees-carved-art/30675385/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Damaged Jeff trees to be carved into art as part of the Tall Stacks Tree Art project", "title": "Damaged Jeff trees to be carved into art", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6472b9ebe1a2b58bf9521247eab6459cf84ea52f/c=134-0-667-533&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/25/Louisville/B9318171161Z.1_20150725173956_000_GDBBEORAI.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8fd588f0f44b12068efa2339672115e3a8a4c410/c=200-0-600-533/local/-/media/2015/07/25/Louisville/B9318171161Z.1_20150725173956_000_GDBBEORAI.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/638654ae1d20bc87a2eaa76ee81d38cdcabce667/c=134-0-667-533/local/-/media/2015/07/25/Louisville/B9318171161Z.1_20150725173956_000_GDBBEORAI.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/68ca7fed1fb4a9555a427c22d66fa056de2620b5/c=44-0-755-533/local/-/media/2015/07/25/Louisville/B9318171161Z.1_20150725173956_000_GDBBEORAI.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c938dc92fc3a3ca9191e7d52655363c522c8fd01/c=0-42-800-492&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/07/25/Louisville/B9318171161Z.1_20150725173956_000_GDBBEORAI.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-07-25T17:39:56-04:00", "shorthed": "Art from an eyesore", "articleid": 30675385, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/91663fb702b52330025b57acd219649a8481db29/c=0-42-800-492/local/-/media/2015/07/25/Louisville/B9318171161Z.1_20150725173956_000_GDBBEORAI.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/759890191a377e8eda26af666bd1e40795443d57/c=250-0-550-533/local/-/media/2015/07/25/Louisville/B9318171161Z.1_20150725173956_000_GDBBEORAI.1-0.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "data", "author": "Jenna Esarey", "pageclass": "article", "title": "Damaged Jeff trees to be carved into art"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaacd\"", "article_summary": "The Port Fulton Neighborhood Association provided barbecue, chips, and watermelon for guests at the event kickoff.\n\u201cWe focused on downtown early on because of the walking bridge,\u201d said Nathan Samuel, city council member and leader of the Jeffersonville Public Art Commission.\n\u201cWe want people to say, \u2018have you seen that place?\u2019.\u201dSteamboats played a significant role in the history of Port Fulton.\nThe $8,000 project is funded by grants from the Indiana Art Commission and a Redevelopment Neighborhood Grant given to Port Fulton Neighborhood Association.\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to make everything in the park art related,\u201d said city council member Mike Smith, a life-long resident of the neighborhood."}
