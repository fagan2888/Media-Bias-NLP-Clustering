Standord has everything ready: her computer, informational brochures and a hand-written tally of the visitors.\n\n\u201cAt the moment we have zero applications completed,\u201d she told Florida Watchdog. \u201cSo far the system allows us to create an account, start the application process and then gets frizzy,\u201d she said.\n\nHer frustration typifies the struggles health centers throughout the country are facing as they attempt to get the new health care program up and running. Read our report of October 9.\n\n\u201cPeople are eager to have information about the new health program because many can\u2019t afford health insurance in the private market,\u201d Stanford explained.\n\nSince the program began Oct. 1, about 200 people have sought her help with navigating the program. While the federal government has yet to share with the public any of the enrollment particulars with regards to data on race, income or nationality, Stanford estimated the majority of her visitors were either Americans or permanent residents.\n\nBut people with visas will be entitled to benefits, albeit with some restrictions.\n\n\u201cPeople want to know if they qualify for a subsidy and how much the insurance will cost them,\u201d Stanford said.\n\nTo qualify for a subsidy, income first needs to be verified. \u201cIn the application process they verify that the income they say [they earned] matches what has been reported and we have seen that not everyone qualifies to receive Medicaid, but can apply to buy subsidized insurance,\u201d she said.\n\nAmong the people who anxiously await more information is Judy Rosita, a single mother of three from Haiti who has lived in the United States for 21 years.\n\n\u201cI want to know [what it will cost] because I don\u2019t earn enough money to afford health insurance and need help,\u201d she said.\n\nThe health center recently received about $600,000 in federal funds to help recruit the uninsured. According to the hospital\u2019s 2012 annual report, 68 percent of its patients didn\u2019t have insurance.\n\nThe federal government has already given Florida more than $8 million in its push to get more than 1 million people (44 percent who are currently uninsured) enrolled in the program.\n\nStanford\u2019s employer used its money to train her and others for that uninsured push. Now, with pen in hand, she waits patiently for the bugs to be worked out so she can do her job.\n\nContact Marianela Toledo at Marianela.Toledo@FloridaWatchdog.org twitter @mtoledoreporter", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Health workers enroll Florida residents in Obamacare, but application problems persist.", "title": "Health centers enroll Floridians in Obamacare as application problems persist - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/10/IMG_3865.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-17T11:48:12+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/110153/health-centers-enroll-floridians-in-obamacare-as-application-problems-persist/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Florida", "published_time": "2013-10-10T07:44:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-17T11:48:12+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Health workers enroll Florida residents in Obamacare, but application problems persist.", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/10/IMG_3865.jpg"}, "title": "Health centers enroll Floridians in Obamacare as application problems persist - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Health workers enroll Florida residents in Obamacare, but application problems persist."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd20\"", "article_summary": "\u201cPeople are eager to have information about the new health program because many can\u2019t afford health insurance in the private market,\u201d Stanford explained.\nHer frustration typifies the struggles health centers throughout the country are facing as they attempt to get the new health care program up and running.\n\u201cI want to know [what it will cost] because I don\u2019t earn enough money to afford health insurance and need help,\u201d she said.\nShe is a certified application counselor, a designation given to specially-training staff and volunteers charged with helping people understand apply, and enroll for Obamacare.\n\u201cSo far the system allows us to create an account, start the application process and then gets frizzy,\u201d she said."}
