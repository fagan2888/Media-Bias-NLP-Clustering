The authority asked private companies from around the globe to help shape the state's strategy to launch the first stage of its train line, considered the most ambitious infrastructure project in the United States.\n\nLed by China Railway International, the Chinese team proposed it could provide big elements of the project, including design expertise, construction, equipment procurement, and rolling stock. It also proposed financing from the Export-Import Bank of China.\n\nBy packaging large pieces of the high-speed rail line together, for delivery by a single contractor, the project\u2019s cost and construction timeline would be greatly reduced, the team proposed.\n\n\u201cTo the Chinese team, a relatively large-scale contract is proper and reasonable,\u201d said the letter, obtained by Reuters through a Public Records Act request.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s high-speed rail line would run trains at speeds of up to 220 miles per hour between Los Angeles and San Francisco by 2029 and, later, expand to San Diego and Sacramento.\n\nThe United States is a key target for China's rail industry, even though policymakers have been split over the need for high-speed rail and some have taken a dim view of Chinese involvement. Last month, a unit of China's CRRC Corp, the world's biggest train maker by revenue, agreed to a deal to help build a high-speed link between Las Vegas and Los Angeles.\n\nCalifornia still needs a large amount of funding to complete its rail line. About $13.2 billion of the estimated $68 billion has been raised through state and federal funds, plus a pledge of cap-and-trade proceeds, or funds paid by companies to offset carbon emissions.\n\nThe Chinese team proposed that under \u201cappropriate loan conditions,\" the Export-Import Bank of China could \"satisfy the financing needs of the project.\u201d\n\nBut the Chinese also warned that California should provide additional public financing and guarantee future project debt to appease uneasy investors.\n\n\u201cDue to the huge financing gap of the project, potential private investors and lenders may be cautious,\u201d the Chinese team wrote.\n\nChina has recently clinched contracts in Russia, the latest in an aggressive push to procure high-speed rail deals overseas. It faced hurdles in Mexico and Indonesia due to bureaucratic flip-flops in those countries.\n\n(Reporting by Robin Respaut; Editing by David Gregorio)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A team of Chinese firms, along with the Export-Import Bank o", "title": "Chinese firms want to build, finance California high-speed train", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/16/Chinese-firms-want-build-finance-California-high-speed-train", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/california-rail-china_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/16/Chinese-firms-want-build-finance-California-high-speed-train", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/california-rail-china_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A team of Chinese firms, along with the Export-Import Bank o", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c1d\"", "article_summary": "The firms expressed their interest last month in a 23-page document sent to the California High-Speed Rail Authority.\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A team of Chinese firms, along with the Export-Import Bank of China, wants to build and finance a large part of California\u2019s proposed 800-mile high-speed rail project.\nChina has recently clinched contracts in Russia, the latest in an aggressive push to procure high-speed rail deals overseas.\n\u201cTo the Chinese team, a relatively large-scale contract is proper and reasonable,\u201d said the letter, obtained by Reuters through a Public Records Act request.\nLed by China Railway International, the Chinese team proposed it could provide big elements of the project, including design expertise, construction, equipment procurement, and rolling stock."}
