Ron Sachs/Zuma Press\n\nFederal Reserve staffers in June were somewhat more pessimistic than central bank officials about the economic outlook, according to the staff\u2019s projections ahead of the Fed\u2019s June policy meeting.\n\nThe staff forecasts were inadvertently posted online last month, the Fed said Friday. They serve as background information for policy makers as they decide how to set interest rates. For that reason, they tend to be closely guarded and are usually released with a five-year delay.\n\nIn June, the staffers saw economic growth dropping from 2.41% in 2016 to 1.73% in 2020, a bleaker assessment than the officials\u2019 projections, which pegged growth at between 2.0% and 2.3% after 2017. They also saw inflation rising to 1.97% by 2020, lower than the central bank\u2019s target of 2%. Fed officials, on the other hand, project longer run inflation at 2%.\n\nThe Fed has held its benchmark short-term interest rate\u2014the federal-funds rate\u2014in a range from zero to 0.25% since December 2008. Most officials have indicated they expect to start raising it this year, but they haven\u2019t decided when to start and how much to lift it by year end. The policy makers will hold a meeting next week and are widely expected to leave the rate unchanged.\n\nThe staff in June projected an average federal-funds rate of 0.35% in the fourth quarter of 2015, rising to 1.26% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2.12% in the fourth quarter of 2017. By contrast, policy makers on the committee saw a higher median fed-funds rate of 0.625% at the end of this year, rising to 1.625% in 2016 and 2.875% in 2017.\n\nThe staff projections suggest policy makers will raise rates just once this year, said Tara Sinclair, chief economist at Indeed.\n\n\u201cIf there isn\u2019t going to be a recession over the next five to 10 years, I think these forecasts are relatively pessimistic because they\u2019re predicting that even though we\u2019re kind of back in normal times, we\u2019re not seeing strong growth,\u201d said Ms. Sinclair. \u201cThat\u2019s a combination of lower expectations for productivity and labor force participation.\u201d\n\nFed staff saw the unemployment rate leveling off at slightly above 5% in the longer term, a view that was roughly on par with the expectations of committee members.\n\nThe Fed staff projections are relied on most by the board members, including Chairwoman Janet Yellen. The 12 regional Fed bank presidents have their own research staff.\n\nNote: On Friday evening, the Fed said its original release of staff projections included incorrect estimates for gross domestic product and inflation and released corrected versions.
