(AP) \u2014 From the time it was built in this quaint village 45 years ago, the county building has stirred strong opinions for its modernism-meets-Mayberry look: a geometric jumble of irregularly stacked concrete-and-glass boxes.\n\nWhile the Orange County Government Center has been hailed by architectural experts as a modernist treasure, many residents have viewed it as just an odd, ugly place to apply for a driver\u2019s license.\n\nAs crews prepare to renovate and partially demolish the sprawling building in this suburban and rural county 50 miles northwest of Manhattan, local preservationists are fighting in court to halt a project they say will permanently disfigure the landmark.\n\nMany locals have more mixed feelings.\n\n\u201cFrom the outside, it\u2019s a horrible-looking building,\u201d said resident Arnie Weintraub.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t fit the right look of our village, or town, or area,\u201d added Brian Dunlevy, as he worked on a bike at his Joe Fix Its shop. \u201cIt\u2019s here. Should it be? I don\u2019t think so. But it\u2019s here.\u201d\n\nThe building was designed by the late architect Paul Rudolph, a celebrated figure of mid-20th century style that came to be known as brutalism. (The name is not derived from the word \u201cbrutal,\u201d as many assume, but from the French term for raw concrete.) Though considered a genius, Rudolph hasn\u2019t always been appreciated by a public that sees cold-looking concrete instead of elegant interplay between light and space.\n\nThe building was closed in September 2011 after it was damaged by the remnants of Hurricane Irene, forcing county operations to other buildings.\n\nBut complaints about maintaining the building, completed in 1970, predated the storm: Those big windows letting in light also let in too much cold; the roof \u2014 which looks like a three-dimensional checkerboard \u2014 leaks. County executive Steven Neuhaus recalls buckets placed around the building 25 years ago when he applied for his driver\u2019s license.\n\nWith the threat of demolition looming a few years ago, the World Monuments Fund put it on its 2012 global watch list.\n\nCounty officials settled on a compromise plan to replace one of the three sections to give the front entrance a more generic, glassy municipal look. The other two sections would be taken down to their concrete skeletons and built back up the shape of the original building, with some functional changes such as a simpler roof line.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to still look at this building and see Rudolph\u2019s touch in it,\u201d Neuhaus said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Modernist gem or eyesore?
