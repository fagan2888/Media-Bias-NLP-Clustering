More than half the physicians said these urgent care centers were marketing themselves as alternatives to visiting the ED.\n\nAs for the effects of these new care options, more than one-third of the respondents noticed a change in the number of patients visiting their ED as a result of the nearby urgent care centers, with 21 percent saying there was a decline in patient volume and 16 percent saying there was an increase. And it seems many aren't convinced of their value--77 percent said \"they see patients with more complicated issues\" due to the growth of urgent care centers, and more than three quarters of the ED physicians indicated they are concerned about patients with serious medical conditions going to an urgent care center before going to the ED.\n\n\"This is a new twist, given all of the attention focused on preventing emergency visits,\" ACEP President Michael Gerardi, M.D., told Forbes. \"Many people may feel they are saving time or money by going first to urgent care, but in instances of serious illness, that loss of time can be dangerous. Urgent care centers are great options for common medical problems, but they are not substitutes for emergency care.\"\n\nThough many have hailed them as efficient, affordable healthcare treatment options that hold an increasing appeal to younger generations, the ACEP poll is not the first time questions have been raised about the drawbacks of urgent care centers. Many EDs and primary care practices are concerned about the competition posed by the rapid growth of the industry, despite the fact that many hospitals are choosing to pursue partnerships with urgent care centers, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nThe poll also found that 72 percent of ED physicians think states should have specific staffing or equipment criteria for urgent care centers. Gerardi reinforced this sentiment, telling Forbes that urgent care centers are best equipped to \"treat minor illnesses and injuries, such as sprains and minor cuts requiring stiches. They don't have the capabilities that emergency departments do for complex diagnoses and treatments.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- check out the poll (.pdf)\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nUrgent care centers compete with EDs for patients\n\nHospital chains getting into urgent care in a big way\n\nYoung adults more likely to turn to urgent care centers instead of primary care physicians\n\nUrgent care clinics use fast-food industry tactics to deliver affordable, efficient healthcare\n\nUrgent care centers more convenient, cheaper than EDs\n\nBlues plan exec: Urgent care centers don't pay", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amid the healthcare industry's efforts to reduce the\u00a0overuse of emergency departments, a new\u00a0poll\u00a0indicates too many patients may seek treatment at\u00a0urgent care centers\u00a0instead, posing a risk to their health.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Amid the healthcare industry's efforts to reduce the\u00a0overuse of emergency departments, a new\u00a0poll\u00a0indicates too many patients may seek treatment at\u00a0urgent care centers\u00a0instead, posing a risk to their health.", "title": "Do urgent care centers hurt patients?", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/do-urgent-care-centers-hurt-patients/2014-12-10", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP),Care Delivery,emergency department,Emergency Department Physicians,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Urgent Care Centers", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbaa9\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:- check out the poll (.pdf)- read the articleRelated Articles:Urgent care centers compete with EDs for patientsHospital chains getting into urgent care in a big wayYoung adults more likely to turn to urgent care centers instead of primary care physiciansUrgent care clinics use fast-food industry tactics to deliver affordable, efficient healthcareUrgent care centers more convenient, cheaper than EDsBlues plan exec: Urgent care centers don't pay\nUrgent care centers are great options for common medical problems, but they are not substitutes for emergency care.\"\nMore than half the physicians said these urgent care centers were marketing themselves as alternatives to visiting the ED.\nGerardi reinforced this sentiment, telling Forbes that urgent care centers are best equipped to \"treat minor illnesses and injuries, such as sprains and minor cuts requiring stiches.\nThe poll also found that 72 percent of ED physicians think states should have specific staffing or equipment criteria for urgent care centers."}
