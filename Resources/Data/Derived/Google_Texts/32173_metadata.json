The charge of abuse of official capacity stemmed from Perry\u2019s threat to veto funding for the Travis County District Attorney office\u2019s Public Integrity Unit unless Democratic District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg agreed to resign.\n\nRelated: Perry Might Have to Run for President While on Trial\n\nPerry waved off the charges as a politically motivated stunt that would fall apart under court scrutiny. However, a Texas judge in November 2014 refused to toss out the two charges on technical grounds and Perry had to continue to explore a second bid for the White House with criminal charges hanging over him that potentially carried jail time if he was convicted.\n\nOn Friday, a Texas appeals court judge, Bert Richardson, dismissed the felony coercion charge against Perry, a big boost for the Republican who has been struggling to improve on his lowly showing in the polls in the crowded race for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nRichardson ruled that Perry\u2019s First Amendment rights protected him from the \u201ccoercision of a public servant\u201d charge. However, the judge denied Perry\u2019s request to dismiss the \u201cabuse of official capacity\u201d charge.\n\nTony Buzbee, one of Perry\u2019s lawyers, hailed the court ruling and said he expects the entire case to be dismissed once the trial begins. \u201cThe appeals court made clear that this case was questionable,\u201d he said in a statement, according to the Texas Tribune.\n\nRelated: Trump Bump Continues, but Support for The Donald May Be Limited\n\nPerry, who registered a modest four percent approval among Republican voters in the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, got a lot of attention this week when he clashed with Trump.\n\nPerry denounced the real estate magnate and reality TV star a \u201ccancer on conservatism\u201d who should be driven from the campaign and the party following Trump\u2019s disparaging remarks about Sen. John McCain\u2019s heroism during the Vietnam War era and his attacks on illegal immigrants as \u201crapists\u201d and criminals. The high-flying Trump, who leads the GOP field with 22 percent to 24 percent of the Republican vote, responded dismissively and accused Perry of being a \u201chypocrite\u201d because he once sought Trump\u2019s support for his campaign.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Former Texas governor Rick Perry \u2013 the self-anointed chief GOP critic of Donald Trump", "title": "Perry Breathes Half a Sigh of Relief as Judge Drops a Charge", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/24/Perry-Breathes-Half-Sigh-Relief-Judge-Drops-Charge", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-perry_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/24/Perry-Breathes-Half-Sigh-Relief-Judge-Drops-Charge", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-perry_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Former Texas governor Rick Perry \u2013 the self-anointed chief GOP critic of Donald Trump", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbb1c\"", "article_summary": "However, the judge denied Perry\u2019s request to dismiss the \u201cabuse of official capacity\u201d charge.\nBack in August 2014, Perry was hit with two criminal felony indictments in Texas charging him with abuse of official power and coercion of a public servant.\nRichardson ruled that Perry\u2019s First Amendment rights protected him from the \u201ccoercision of a public servant\u201d charge.\n\u201cThe appeals court made clear that this case was questionable,\u201d he said in a statement, according to the Texas Tribune.\nTony Buzbee, one of Perry\u2019s lawyers, hailed the court ruling and said he expects the entire case to be dismissed once the trial begins."}
