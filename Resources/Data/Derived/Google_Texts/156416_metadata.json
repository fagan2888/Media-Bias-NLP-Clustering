Clinton once again ripped Sanders for promising more than he could ever deliver on universal health care and wrapped herself in the banner of the president saying that before Obamacare existed it was a proposal called \u201cHillary-care.\u201d The debate once again displayed the difficult challenge Clinton faces. She is the pragmatic realist running against a challenger promising free college, universal single-payer healthcare and parades of bankers in handcuffs.\n\nClinton promises an expansion of Obamacare, targeted efforts to attack student debt and Wall Street reform that focuses on risk more than size. Clinton\u2019s approach is far more realistic, especially given the likely makeup of Congress in 2017. It\u2019s also much harder to fit in a soundbite and fire up a leftward-moving Democratic Party. Clinton will likely win the nomination but she faces a very difficult job selling realism versus idealism. She probably had her strongest moment at the end when she said \u2014 in reference to Sanders\u2019 corporate bashing \u2014 \u201cI am not a single issue candidate and I do not believe we live in a single issue country.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSAME PROBLEM IN THE GOP \u2014 Clinton\u2019s dilemma is pretty neatly mirrored among the GOP candidates who have to somehow beat a man promising to build a giant wall with Mexico, beat the crap out of all our enemies and generally dominate everything in completely non-specific and non-possible ways. Beating fantasy with reality is just really hard. We all like super hero movies and fairytales. We don\u2019t always like eating our vegetables and going to bed early.\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA BLAST \u2014 Great POLITICO Caucus event in Charleston last night. Some tasty clips for you. AEI\u2019s James Pethokoukis said GOP candidates are no longer bothering to try and pay for giant tax cuts: http://politi.co/1PQoiar\n\nGene Sperling riffed on how Donald Trump is catering to people\u2019s worst instincts: http://politi.co/20YEOsB\n\nIS THE MARKET HITTING BOTTOM? \u2014 Wells Capital\u2019s Jim Paulsen: \u201cThe S&P 500 hit fresh new intra-day and closing lows for this correction \u2026 We certainly do not know where or when this stock market will finally bottom and would not be surprised if the S&P ultimately breaches the 1800 level before a sustaining rally commences \u2026 However, we do think a bottom is nearing. \u2026 [T]he character of a market bottom is forming. Values have been significantly cheapened, investor sentiment has turned decidedly more fearful and a potential positive catalyst of better economic news may be on the horizon.\u201d\n\nBMO\u2019s Jack Ablin: \u201cThe market selloff has gotten pretty emotional, particularly among individual investors. Recent readings from the American Association of Individual Investors show that bullishness among small investors is at its lowest level since the \u2018flash crash.\u2019 Who can blame them? Since the beginning of the year the S&P 500 is off about 10 percent and the small cap Russell 2000 is more than 15 percent lower.\n\n\u201cConsidering the lack of good news, it\u2019s heartening to see favorable action in the Smart Money index, which tracks stock market action in the first half hour of trading and compares it to the last half hour. \u2026 For all the terrible headlines, it appears that market action before the closing bell is much more positive than morning activity, indicating that the pros are accumulating stocks.\u201d\n\nMAYBE NOT \u2014 Bloomberg: \u201cThe global equity bear market deepened in Asian trading, with Japanese stocks headed for their worst week since 2008 amid anxiety over central banks\u2019 ability to revive the world economy. U.S. crude rose from a 12-year low. The Topix index slumped 4.1 percent in Tokyo as traders returned from holiday, pushing the regional Asian benchmark toward its steepest weekly drop since gyrations in Chinese assets at the start of the year.\n\n\u201cThe index pared some of its losses as the yen weakened for the first time this week. U.S. index futures indicated gains after losses there helped the MSCI All-Country Index cap a 20 percent slide from its May record. \u2026 Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said regulators will respond to market volatility if necessary after a move to negative rates failed to assuage anxieties last month\u201d http://bloom.bg/1SLaGQz\n\nMORE TREASURY TEA LEAVES \u2014 OK, at some point we will pump the brakes on Clinton Treasury Secretary talk. But not yet.\n\nOne sage Washington hand emails: \u201cI think MM is right that the odds of HRC picking someone directly from the financial industry are low. But also missing from the discussion is the diversity factor. Treasury has never been headed by a woman or minority. The historic nature of the first female president nominating the first woman, African Amer., Hispanic, etc. will be tempting.\n\n\u201cIn addition to Sandberg and Burwell, which MM mentioned earlier, HRC would likely consider diverse, accomplished candidates w/ non-Wall Street ties like Sam\u2019s Club CEO Rosalind Brewer, Rhode Island Governor (and former State Treasurer) Gina Raimondo, Brainard, Tyson, CFTC Commissioner Sharon Bowen. Former Fed Vice Chair and current TIAA-CREF CEO Roger Ferguson and Citibank Exec Ray McGuire could also make a short-list\u201d\n\nAnd yet another smart person: \u201cAmazing to me that no one has stated the obvious regarding Laura Tyson, Bill Clinton's Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers & currently at Berkeley (which is as far as you can get from Wall Street). She has a long & positive relationship with the Clintons, & would be the first woman to be named SecTreas.\u201d\n\nAnd one more! \u201cSo if you do another round of this(!), Lael Brainard and Laura D'Andrea Tyson would be good additions to the mix.\u201d\n\nLast one for the day! \u201cI am sure you don't need one more name \u2014 but if HRC does win this election it will be on the back of minority voters \u2014 she will have to do something historic in her appointments. We have never had a black or Asian Treas Sec so how about some of these folks: Ken Chenault of Amex; Ajay Bhanga of MasterCard; Punit Renjen of Deloitte; Roger Ferguson; Ursula Burns, Xerox\u201d\n\nEVEN THE GOP HATES WALL STREET! \u2014 Bloomberg Businessweek\u2019s Josh Green in a piece up at 6 a.m.: \u201cRepublicans up and down the ballot are trying to harness voters\u2019 anger by criticizing Wall Street donors. The Republican presidential candidates have turned on the financial giants that have been their biggest benefactors \u2014 and are attacking one another for being too close to the financial industry\u201d http://bloom.bg/20YLEhW\n\nCOMING SOON: MOHAMED A. EL-ERIAN EVENT \u2014 Save March 10th on your calendar for a great America\u2019s Fiscal Future event at Nasdaq with Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz and author of the must-read new book \u201cThe Only Game in Town: Central Banks, Instability, and Avoiding the Next Collapse.\u201d http://bit.ly/20O4uf0\n\nGOOD FRIDAY MORNING \u2014 Morning Money goes dark Monday to observe the President\u2019s Day holiday, returning Tuesday, Feb. 16th. Email me on bwhite@politico.com and follow me on Twitter @morningmoneyben.\n\nPOLITICO\u2019s Colin Wilhelm on the \u201cBig Short\u201d in DC: \u201cDirector Adam McKay \u2026 was up on stage before about 300 of his closest D.C. friends Tuesday night for a showing of his (Oscar-nominated) movie adaptation of Michael Lewis' book of the same name. Sens. Sherrod Brown (D-Oh.), Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) provided bipartisan Congressional sponsorship for the event and introduced McKay, who joked the that he would've preferred if his 2008 comedy 'Step Brothers' were shown to Congress instead.\n\n\u201c\u2018The main reason I wanted to do this was so we don't forget,\u2019 said Brown, ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, who also added that his home zip code in Cleveland was the hardest hit in the country by foreclosures in 2007. \u2026 \u2018If something looks too good to be true, it probably is,\u2019 said Isakson, who also gave the most succinct yet thorough synopsis of the 2008 financial crisis your correspondent has heard.\u201d\n\nTHIS MORNING ON POLITICO PRO FINANCIAL SERVICES \u2014 Colin Wilhelm on the CFPB's small-dollar lending rule \u2014 and to get Morning Money every day before 6 a.m. \u2014 please contact Pro Services at (703) 341-4600 info@politicopro.com\n\nTHINK THE DEBT CEILING IS OVER? THINK AGAIN!! \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Ben Weyl: \u201cThought you didn't have to pay attention to the debt limit until next year? Think again. It's true that last year's budget deal inked by President Barack Obama and on-his-way-out Speaker John Boehner raised the debt ceiling until about March 2017. But House Republicans are still angry with how the administration has handled the issue and they want to spotlight the ballooning federal debt.\n\n\u201cSo \u2026 the House passed legislation (H.R. 3442) to require the Treasury secretary to testify before Congress within 60 days of the federal debt limit being reached and to present a plan to curb government red ink. The bill was backed on a near-party-line vote, and it faces an uncertain road in the Senate.\u201d\n\nLANGONE GOES KASICH \u2014 POLITICO\u2019s Daniel Strauss: \u201cOhio Gov. John Kasich has secured the support of Home Depot co-founder Ken Langone, a megadonor who previously backed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Kasich's campaign announced that they had brought over Langone on Thursday. Langone, a brash and outspoken moderate Republican who brings his own network of like-minded donors, has an estimated net worth of $2.8 billion, according to Forbes.\n\n\u201cIt's a major coup for Kasich who, like Christie, has been running in the establishment lane in the Republican primary and also devoted most of his campaign efforts to a strong showing in the New Hampshire Republican primary. Kasich ended up in second place behind only Donald Trump, while Christie placed a disappointing sixth.\u201d\n\nMARKET SEES U.S. RECESSION (AND MIGHT CAUSE ONE) \u2014 WSJ\u2019s Greg Ip: \u201cIs the U.S. headed for recession? The markets suggest so. With Thursday\u2019s selloff, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down 14.5 percent from its all-time high last May. Yields on risky bonds continue to climb, while investors have sought safety in U.S. Treasurys, sending those yields lower. And oil has hit a nearly 12\u00bd-year low. Yet the economic data show no recession. Job growth in January was healthy, and employers are having trouble filling vacancies.\n\n\u201cThis dichotomy is neatly captured by two indexes compiled by Cornerstone Macro. One, using financial indicators such as the stock market and corporate bond yields, puts the probability the U.S. is now in recession at 50 percent. The other, which adds in macroeconomic data such as loan delinquencies and inflation-adjusted income, puts the probability at just 28 percent. Of course markets often wrongly predict recessions. But in some circumstances they can help bring them about\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1XmO5ZA\n\nCENTRAL BANKS FAILING? \u2014 NYT\u2019s Landon Thomas, Jr.: \u201cWhat if the bazooka is shooting blanks? Since the financial crisis, it has been gospel for many investors that some combination of actions by central banks \u2014 bond buying, bold promises or flirtations with negative interest rates \u2014 would be enough to keep the global economy out of recession. But investors\u2019 distress over the latest volley by a major central bank, the surprise decision on Thursday by the Swedish central bank to lower its short-term rate to minus 0.50 percent from minus 0.35 percent, has heightened fears that brazen actions by central bankers are now making things worse, not better.\n\n\u201cGlobal stock markets sank, the price of oil plunged to a 13-year low and investors fled to safe haven instruments like gold and United States Treasury bills. Markets generally embrace conviction and run away from indecision \u2014 which is what many see in the policy making of some of the large central banks these days. The Swedish central bank, the Riksbank, for example, has been criticized in the past for prematurely raising rates, and Thursday\u2019s rate cut was opposed by two bank deputies.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1mvVb0f\n\nJAMIE DIMON MAKES BIG BUY \u2014 FT\u2019s Ben McLannahan: \u201cJamie Dimon has tried to put out a fire in financials stocks, spending more than $26m to buy half a million shares in JPMorgan Chase, the bank he has run for a decade. The purchase \u2014 confirmed in a filing on Thursday evening \u2014 is the first big open-market purchase Mr Dimon has made since the \u201cLondon Whale\u201d scandal four years ago, when the bank\u2019s shares were knocked by the disclosure that a trading desk had racked up billions of dollars of losses. It will be seen as a statement by Mr Dimon that the global sell-off in bank shares has been overdone.\n\n\u201cJPMorgan, the biggest US bank by assets, has been caught up in the maelstrom, losing 17 per cent of its market value since the turn of the year. Wall Street analysts have been urging clients to resist the urge to ditch their bank stocks, while elder statesmen of the banking industry such as Dick Kovacevich, former head of Wells Fargo, have appealed for calm. Even so, the sector has continued to drop amid fears over China, plunging oil and the Bank of Japan\u2019s embrace of negative interest rates\u201d http://on.ft.com/1PqiAuE\n\nALSO FOR YOUR RADAR \u2014\n\nCLINTON MONEY BLITZ \u2014 IBT\u2019s David Sirota and Andrew Perez: \u201cClinton\u2019s campaign is launching a fundraising blitz that includes events with representatives of industries that have significant business interests before the federal government. An International Business Times review of fundraising invitations found that the Clinton campaign\u2019s nationwide tour includes events with corporate officials from the food, investment and energy sectors \u2014 all of which have vested financial interests in the policies that the next presidential administration will decide\u201d http://bit.ly/1Ru613T\n\nCHAMBER ON THE FIDUCIARY RULE \u2014 Via the U.S. Chamber: \u201cThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce is up with a new episode of its podcast series, \u201cThe Business Impact,\u201d which features U.S. Chamber Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness President and CEO David Hirschmann who discusses the proposed rule and the impact it will have on small businesses\u201d http://bit.ly/1IGXBDy\n\nBANKS RACE TO BEAT THE TROLLS \u2014 Bloomberg Businesweek\u2019s Susan Decker and Elizabeth Dexheimer: \u201cBanks and Silicon Valley are on a collision course, the future of finance may be at stake, and one side is brandishing its most dreaded weapon: the PowerPoint presentation\u201d http://bloom.bg/1TbYKpi\n\nAIG BOWS TO ACTIVISTS \u2014 FT\u2019s Alistair Gray: \u201cThe activist investors who have called on AIG to break itself up have secured seats on the insurer\u2019s board after directors struck a deal to avoid a damaging fight with shareholders. John Paulson, the hedge fund manager, and a representative of the billionaire Carl Icahn are to become directors from May, AIG said on Thursday \u2026 People close to AIG billed the arrangement with its rebel shareholders as a truce that lessens the immediate pressure on directors to split apart the company\u201d http://on.ft.com/1KJBwFP\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Clinton's conundrum \u2014 Same problem in the GOP \u2014 South Carolina blast", "title": "Debate wrap", "url": "http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-money/2016/02/debate-wrap-212674", "image": "http://static.politico.com/97/de/e15842c94e928ce8b561e20745a0/whitelogoondots.jpeg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Clinton's conundrum \u2014 Same problem in the GOP \u2014 South Carolina blast", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Debate wrapDEBATE WRAP: CLINTON\u2019S CONUNDRUM \u2014 Strong showdown between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin last night.\nMarkets generally embrace conviction and run away from indecision \u2014 which is what many see in the policy making of some of the large central banks these days.\nClinton promises an expansion of Obamacare, targeted efforts to attack student debt and Wall Street reform that focuses on risk more than size.\n\u2014 Bloomberg Businessweek\u2019s Josh Green in a piece up at 6 a.m.: \u201cRepublicans up and down the ballot are trying to harness voters\u2019 anger by criticizing Wall Street donors.\nIt will be seen as a statement by Mr Dimon that the global sell-off in bank shares has been overdone."}
