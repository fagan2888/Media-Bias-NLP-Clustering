I was really relieved. I felt like I was bombarding my doctor with so many different problems but it was because I hadn\u2019t seen a doctor for so long.\u201d\n\nValenzuela is one of 20,000 former foster youth in California who are newly eligible for health care coverage.\n\n\u201cYouth were formerly allowed to stay on Medi-Cal through the age of 21,\u201d said Constance Farrell, spokeswoman for Alliance for Children, a group that provides free legal services relating to education and adoptions for foster children. It also assists foster youth after the age of 21 when they\u2019ve left the system.\n\n\u201cThat is essentially the same as children staying on their parent\u2019s insurance,\u201d she said about the new rules. \u201cIt\u2019s an equitable structure.\u201d\n\nThe new coverage is needed, especially for foster children, said Taylor Dudley, staff attorney for Alliance for Children.\n\n\u201cFoster children traditionally have the most chronic and debilitating health conditions among low-income children,\u201d Dudley said. \u201cIt\u2019s often times due to abuse and neglect.\u201d\n\nThe new coverage for foster children doesn\u2019t require them to apply every year, she said. It also offers substance abuse counseling and mental heath services as well as general care, Dudley said.\n\n\u201cWe have seen many foster youth take advantage and use the program,\u201d she said. \u201cMany use the program because of long-standing health conditions.\u201d\n\nFor others, it\u2019s needed because of an accident, she said.\n\nOne client of Alliance for Children was involved in a hit-and-run accident while riding a bicycle, she said.\n\n\u201cBefore the Affordable Care Act, he would have had hundreds of thousands dollars in medical bills,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nJohn Peel, executive director for Whittier-based Concept 7, a foster-care and adoption agency, said it\u2019s too early to see the full effects of the new rules but it could ensure that the foster children consistently see a doctor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSome of the younger population don\u2019t go to the doctor very much,\u201d Peel said.\n\nBut health-care coverage is important, even for those who are young, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen we start recognizing what it\u2019s not like to have health care, it\u2019s usually when you have a catastrophic illness and can\u2019t get any health care,\u201d Peel said.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to Valenzuela when she turned 22. She was having anxiety attacks and digestive issues.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I needed medical care so bad until I actually lost it,\u201d she said.\n\nShe went to an emergency room and was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nValenzuela was referred to a specialist but never went because she had no insurance.\n\nShe also dropped out of school because of knee problems.\n\nThis year, she qualified for Medi-Cal thanks to the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nShe went to a doctor in February and later saw a gastroenterologist and got some medication.\\\n\nValenzuela also is seeing a dentist for the first time in a long time.\n\nValenzuela was born in to the foster-care system. Her parents couldn\u2019t take care of here because of their drug addiction, she said. She lived in different facilities, including a large group home.\n\nShe left the system at age 18 and a year later became homeless in Pico Rivera.\n\nValenzuela later got into a transitional housing program and now is living on her own in Whittier.\n\nValenzuela is now paid by Los Angeles County to provide care for her sister and brother as part of the foster-care-system. Since they\u2019re under 18, she\u2019s not allowed to provide their names.\n\nValenzuela is going back to Rio Hondo College, where she plans on getting an Associate of Arts degree in administrative justice.\n\nShe wants to get an advanced degree in social work.\n\nStill, Valenzuela also knows she will lose her health insurance when she turns 26 in August.\n\nShe\u2019s not sure what will happen then but plans to apply for regular Medi-Cal.\n\n\u201cMy income isn\u2019t very high,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping my insurance isn\u2019t too expensive.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "WHITTIER >> Recently, Marcy Valenzuela of Whittier went to see a doctor at PIH Health for rheumatoid arthritis that has been causing her pain.It was her first doctor\u2019s visit since she was diagnosed three years ago with the disease", "title": "New federal health-care rules allow foster youth to get coverage until age 26", "og": {"url": "http://www.whittierdailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140705/new-federal-health-care-rules-allow-foster-youth-to-get-coverage-until-age-26", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.whittierdailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LE/20140705/NEWS/140709762/AR/0/AR-140709762.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1088px"}, "type": "article", "title": "New federal health-care rules allow foster youth to get coverage until age 26"}, "twitter": {"domain": "whittierdailynews.com", "description": "WHITTIER >> Recently, Marcy Valenzuela of Whittier went to see a doctor at PIH Health for rheumatoid arthritis that has been causing her pain.It was her first doctor\u2019s visit since she was diagnosed three years ago with the disease", "title": "New federal health-care rules allow foster youth to get coverage until age 26", "url": "http://www.whittierdailynews.com/government-and-politics/20140705/new-federal-health-care-rules-allow-foster-youth-to-get-coverage-until-age-26", "image": {"src": "http://www.whittierdailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LE/20140705/NEWS/140709762/AR/0/AR-140709762.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@WhittierNews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563971431", "iphone": "id503668140", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.whittierdailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Affordable Care Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c5b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhen we start recognizing what it\u2019s not like to have health care, it\u2019s usually when you have a catastrophic illness and can\u2019t get any health care,\u201d Peel said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an equitable structure.\u201dThe new coverage is needed, especially for foster children, said Taylor Dudley, staff attorney for Alliance for Children.\nYoungsters who were in the foster-care system now can get free health care coverage until they turn 26.\n\u201cIt\u2019s often times due to abuse and neglect.\u201dThe new coverage for foster children doesn\u2019t require them to apply every year, she said.\n\u201cFoster children traditionally have the most chronic and debilitating health conditions among low-income children,\u201d Dudley said."}
