The Post-Gazette\u2019s indispensable political analyst Chris Potter has figured that Mr. Trump appears to also have won at least 31 of the 54 other delegates. If he thus takes 48 of the 71 delegates, that would seem a more than fair haul for taking nearly 57 percent of the vote Tuesday.\n\nThat\u2019s an even more remarkable feat considering that voters were asked to vote for Republican delegates on a ballot that DID NOT SAY to which candidate they were allied. Only those voters wise enough or lucky enough to have seen the stories on delegates in mainstream media, or to have been alerted likewise by social media, had any sense which delegate favored which pol.\n\nMr. Potter found many delegates who don\u2019t like this system, and it\u2019s not clear if we\u2019ll ever know how the individual delegates vote at the Republican Convention in Cleveland beginning July 18. But it\u2019s harder to rig a system once people are wise to the rigging.\n\nOn the Democratic side, the presidential ballot was more straightforward, but it still came in two parts: Vote for the candidate, then vote for a slew of delegates identified as being with one candidate or the other. There was no requirement that a voter choose consistently; one could vote for handful of Hillary Clintonites and sprinkle in some Bernie Sanders supporters, too.\n\nAfter voting, I longed to talk with someone less jaded about this process than I. So I drove across town to meet someone who is not quite old enough to vote, Lainey Newman, the 17-year-old Pittsburgh girl who introduced Ms. Clinton at a Monday rally of some 800 people at Westmoreland County Community College.\n\nI\u2019d read that morning of Lainey\u2019s introduction and immediately recognized the name. She\u2019s the Barack Obama Academy of International Studies junior who was just elected governor of the 2017 YMCA Youth & Government Model Legislative Session.\n\nShe took some time off from about six hours of knocking on the doors of potential Clinton supporters in Squirrel Hill to sit down and talk at a Forbes Avenue coffee shop.\n\nI asked what drew her to politics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the fulcrum of how our society functions,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s how the people execute and manifest their ideals. I think government can be beautiful.\u201d\n\nThen this Clinton supporter quoted a Republican congressman she\u2019d met. U.S. Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick of Bucks County had told her, \u201cThe government is the democracy which is the people,\u201d and Lainey liked the simplicity and directness of that explanation.\n\nShe sees herself as a pragmatist, not an idealist. Her parents, both psychologists, told her that Obamacare allowed their patients to get care they otherwise couldn\u2019t afford. That\u2019s essentially HillaryCare, too, Lainey said, and sees her candidate\u2019s experience in government as unparalleled.\n\nShe began volunteering at the Clinton campaign office, down the street from her school in East Liberty, the day it opened last month. She\u2019d originally been scheduled only to pitch social media to the crowd in Westmoreland County on Monday, but she got a call the midnight before the event saying she\u2019d be introducing Ms. Clinton.\n\nYes, she woke her parents up to tell them.\n\nThe next morning, Ms. Clinton \u2014 \u201csuch a calming presence\u201d \u2014 told her, \u201cTake a deep breath. You\u2019re going to be great,\u201d and they walked out together.\n\nHer schoolmates found out \u2014 via social media, not the newspaper, alas \u2014 so it had been quite an Election Day morning already. I left her to more door-knocking.\n\nThat couldn\u2019t have hurt. Ms. Clinton took almost 56 percent of the Pennsylvania vote. The next afternoon, when I reached Lainey, she said she was \u201cthrilled to be part of the success and the action over the past month and a half or so.\u201d\n\nOthers weren\u2019t so happy but that\u2019s politics. It was encouraging to talk with a young woman willing to invest some old-fashioned shoe leather in a candidate. Now I\u2019m hoping her generation can come up with a delegate system as straightforward as her ideals.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrian O\u2019Neill: boneill@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1947.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lainey, a city high schooler, introduced Hillary Clinton at an event Monday.\u00a0\u201dI think government can be beautiful,\u201d she says.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "\u201cBut in politics, because it\u2019s a rigged system, because it\u2019s a corrupt enterprise, in politics you\u2019re allowed to collude.\u201d That\u2019s what Donald Trump told supporters in Rhode Island the day before he whupped the colluders there and in four other primary states.
