The scene was cleared about 1:20 p.m., the agency said.\n\nThe White House was put on lockdown Friday after a man approached a guard booth with a pistol and refused to put it down. A Secret Service agent shot and critically wounded the man, who remained in critical condition Sunday morning. On Friday, a U.S. law enforcement official said that authorities identified the gunman as Jesse Oliveri of Ashland, Pa., about 80 miles northwest of Philadelphia.\n\nGOP look to replace ACA\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As senior House Republicans work on a promised replacement for the Affordable Care Act, two GOP lawmakers plan to introduce an alternative Thursday that would dramatically reshape the nation\u2019s health care system.\n\nThe legislation \u2014 co-sponsored by Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, and Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. \u2014 stands little chance of becoming law as long as a Democrat is in the White House.\n\nThe centerpiece of the Sessions-Cassidy plan is a major change to the tax code that would provide every American adult with $2,500 to purchase health coverage, but also shake up the nation\u2019s current employer-based health insurance system. This new standardized tax credit would replace tax breaks that many Americans currently get if their employer provides health coverage.\n\nN.J. beaches shrink\n\nBRIGANTINE, N.J. \u2014 A stormy winter chewed up New Jersey\u2019s beaches more than usual, requiring greater efforts to restore them before the summer crowds hit the sand.\n\nIn some places, erosion and beach loss was greater this past winter than it was after Superstorm Sandy in 2012, while other places appeared to come through the winter relatively unscathed.\n\nWith Memorial Day crowds a week away from storming the coast, beachgoers will find the Jersey shore ready for visitors, even if some spots are narrower than they were last year.\n\nJon Miller, a coastal expert with Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, said two major storms did significant damage to the beaches: Hurricane Joaquin in October, which passed offshore but still churned up enough surf to cause erosion; and a winter storm the last week of January that carved 15-foot drop-offs into some beaches.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Plus:\u00a0White House scare;\u00a0GOP look to replace Affordable Care Act; and\u00a0New Jersey beaches shrink.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "PHILADELPHIA \u00a0\u2014 Bill Cosby faces a preliminary hearing Tuesday to determine if his criminal sex-assault case in suburban Philadelphia goes to trial.
