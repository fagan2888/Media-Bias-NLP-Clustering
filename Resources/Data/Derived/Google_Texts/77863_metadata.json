It does not refer to a journalist\u2019s speculation about whether Texas Representative Jim Pitts, the chairman of the state house ways and means committee, would be so sand-poundingly stupid as to be the face of the effort to impeach Wallace Hall after having leaned on the University of Texas law school to admit his grossly underqualified son, which is of course precisely what had happened.\n\nThe same Texas prosecutor behind the indictments of Governor Perry and Mr. Hall was also behind the indictments of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Representative Tom DeLay, both of which ultimately were laughed out of court. The point of these indictments is not to obtain convictions; the prosecutor did not even present a case against Senator Hutchison when the matter came to trial. And the point of the Ohio Inquisition was never to achieve a legal victory against the Susan B.
