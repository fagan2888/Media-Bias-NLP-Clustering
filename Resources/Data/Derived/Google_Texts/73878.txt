Veterinarians are warning pet owners about a new canine flu that has made its way to Arizona.

Eight cases have been reported in Maricopa County, and 11 have been reported between Tucson and Casa Grande.

If you notice your dog is lethargic, not eating or coughing, you may want to give your veterinarian a call. When a dog coughs or barks, the virus can be spread up to 50 feet, and it’s contagious for up to a month.

It’s recommended you get your pet vaccinated, and keep in mind that if you board your dog over the holidays, your pet will likely come into contact with several other dogs.
