The closing of all nonessential government funded agencies, offices, parks and museums started Oct. 1, and there's been a wide array of responses.\n\nWhile doomsday enthusiasts have long been preparing for such an event, others view it as an opportunity to make a point.\n\nMeet Steve Hadley, a bartender at the popular Capitol Hill watering hole Sonoma. Since the government shutdown was announced, Hadley has been working on special pricing for beer at Sonoma.\n\nFor furloughed government workers, those who've had to take an involuntary leave of absence from their jobs due to the shutdown, a beer is now priced at $2.
