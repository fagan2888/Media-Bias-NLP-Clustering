The U.S. wants the fighters to encircle the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa and seal a key 60-mile stretch of Syria\u2019s border with Turkey that has served as a supply line for the terrorist organization.\n\nAccording to former House Intelligence Committee chair Mike Rogers, a change in strategy is long overdue. \u201cObviously there need to be a shift. The problem was it needed to happen three and a half years ago,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: 14 Deadly Weapons Russia Has Sent To Syria\n\nThe Michigan Republican took issue with giving weapons and ammo to Syrian forces because the situation on the ground is \u201cmore confusing now than it ever has been\u201d thanks to the various loyalties that have sprung up over the course of the country\u2019s years-long civil war.\n\nStill, Rogers said, the new approach could fare better than the administration\u2019s train-and-equip effort, even though \u201ceverything that went into that fiasco still exists on the ground today.\u201d\n\nHe also expressed concern that the increased airstrikes are meant to deter Russia from launching its own airstrikes, and aren\u2019t being driven by better intelligence about ISIS ground targets.\n\nThe tense situation in the skies between the two former Cold War enemies requires a \u201cmuch deeper, much more thoughtful approach,\u201d according to Rogers.\n\nThe former lawmaker approved of using local forces to secure the border and using them to close off Raqqa rather than sending forces into the city, since ISIS has \u201cheld it for long and prepared for invasion.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Donald Trump Is Vladimir Putin\u2019s Favorite Presidential Candidate\n\nThe strategy could also send a worldwide message to potential ISIS recruits that the group \u201cis not winning.\u201d\n\nTaken together, the moves represent \u201cwhat they have left as a strategy,\u201d said Rogers.\n\nThe shift comes after a series of embarrassing setbacks for the U.S.-led fight against ISIS, especially regarding the administration\u2019s $500 million effort to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels. The program was supposed to churn out thousands of fighters annually, but has yielded only a few dozen that have thus far proven ineffective on the battlefield.\n\nAggressive moves by Russia have also complicated Obama\u2019s efforts in Syria, as personnel and equipment have poured into the country in recent weeks. Russian President Vladimir Putin originally claimed the forces were needed to battle ISIS, but U.S. intelligence has indicated that recent airstrikes executed by Moscow have targeted other opponents of the Assad regime.\n\nFor its part, the White House wouldn\u2019t confirm the report of a strategy shake-up.\n\nRelated: Is Putin Preparing to Use Russian Ground Troops in Syria?\n\n\u201cWhat I will say is those plans cite continued support for Syrian- Kurdish and Syrian-Arab fighters,\u201d press secretary Josh Earnest said during a briefing.\n\nHe touted the role of Syria and Kurdish ground forces have played in taking back territory from ISIS and emphasized that coalition air power has helped rout the terror group.\n\n\u201cI would note that those efforts by Syrian-Kurdish fighters have been backed by U.S. and coalition military airstrikes that have improved their performance on the battlefield,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cSo that is one element of our counter-ISIL strategy that has yielded\u201d progress.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In an effort to break the stalemate in the fight against Islamic State militants, Pres", "title": "Obama Rewrites His Syria Plan, but Is It a Strategy?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/06/Obama-Rewrites-His-Syria-Plan-It-Strategy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09112013_ObamaSyria.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/06/Obama-Rewrites-His-Syria-Plan-It-Strategy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09112013_ObamaSyria.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "In an effort to break the stalemate in the fight against Islamic State militants, Pres", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6128\"", "article_summary": "The moves are meant to bolster thousands of Arab and Kurdish fighters in Syria.\nHe touted the role of Syria and Kurdish ground forces have played in taking back territory from ISIS and emphasized that coalition air power has helped rout the terror group.\nAggressive moves by Russia have also complicated Obama\u2019s efforts in Syria, as personnel and equipment have poured into the country in recent weeks.\nAccording to former House Intelligence Committee chair Mike Rogers, a change in strategy is long overdue.\nIn an effort to break the stalemate in the fight against Islamic State militants, President Obama has reconfigured key elements of the administration\u2019s strategy to degrade and defeat the terror group."}
