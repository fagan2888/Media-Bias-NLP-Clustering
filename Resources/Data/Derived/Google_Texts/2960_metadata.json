Other states are faced with this same problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone would try and sit there with a straight face and tell you that health insurance is cheaper than it was eight years ago,\u201d Yancey remarked after PEEHIP\u2019s board voted Thursday.\n\nThe plan\u2019s administrators will shore up the remainder of the difference by dipping into the state\u2019s retiree health care trust fund, created in 2007 by the Alabama Legislature to save money for the state\u2019s future obligations to retired teachers.\n\nThe largest fee increase, which would have helped avoid a raid of the trust fund, was voted down by PEEHIP\u2019s board. Alabama Education Association (AEA) spokeswoman Amy Marlowe called the fee increase\u2019s defeat a \u201cmajor victory,\u201d adding that \u201c[teachers] just absolutely could not afford any type of increase in premium for the health insurance program,\u201d after eight years without a pay increase.\n\nCurrently, education employees pay a $15 monthly premium for individual coverage, or $177 for family coverage. The proposed increase would have upped the employee\u2019s contribution by $10 for an individual, and $20 for a family.\n\nThe average Alabamian who is not part of the PEEHIP program spends $193 a month buying the most basic coverage on the ObamaCare market, and $371 for a \u201cPlatinum\u201d plan. Family plans cost even more.\n\nIn fact, some Alabama lawmakers look to the increased costs of ObamaCare as an explanation for why PEEHIP is becoming more expensive as well.\n\n\u201cObamaCare is driving up the cost of healthcare for citizens and employers in Alabama, and the State of Alabama employs a lot of people, including teachers,\u201d House Education Budget Chairman Bill Poole told Yellowhammer last year. \u201cIt is going to put a lot of strain and stress on the state\u2019s budgets to try to pay for these added costs.\u201d\n\nPoole said these increased costs to PEEHIP are not only effecting how much teachers will pay out of pocket, but may be precluding teachers from receiving raises and cost of living increases as well.\n\nBecause the majority of the funds making up the shortfall are coming from the trust fund, the program\u2019s administrators worry this decision isn\u2019t the longterm fix PEEHIP needs.\n\n\u201cThis is a major problem that we\u2019re faced with and it\u2019s going to be ongoing,\u201d Yancey said. \u201cEssentially we\u2019re going to have to face this every year to try to figure out how to come up with enough money to keep the program every year, which is a very, very good health insurance program.\u201d\n\nLike this article?
