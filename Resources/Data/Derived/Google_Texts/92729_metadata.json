But because of the way the Democratic caucuses work, the Vermont senator may be closer to an upset than the polls show.\n\nUnder the system in place in Iowa, caucus-goers declare a preference, but that\u2019s only the first step. Once voters\u2019 initial preferences are stated, any candidate that fails to win at least 15 percent of the vote is declared non-viable, and his supporters are asked to reallocate themselves to their second choice.\n\nRelated: Iowa Caucuses \u2013 What Are They and How Do They Work?\n\nFormer Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley is polling at between 4 and 5 percent in the state recently, which suggests that in many if not most caucuses his candidacy will be declared non-viable.\n\nA poll released by Public Policy Polling on Friday afternoon suggests that the reallocation process would result in Sanders gaining substantially more new votes than Clinton. In the survey, 57 percent of O\u2019Malley supporters said they would favor Sanders, over only 27 percent who said they want Clinton. The numbers have been moving in Sanders\u2019 direction, too. The last time PPP asked that question, Sanders\u2019 net advantage was 23 percent as opposed to today\u2019s 30 percent.\n\nSanders trails Clinton badly among registered Democrats, 53-36, but he holds a huge 62-23 advantage over her among independents. It\u2019s long been known that Sanders will have to attract a large number of independents to the polls on Monday; an added wrinkle is that they will have to change their voter registration to Democratic on the spot to support him.\n\nRelated: Trump Takes a Knee as Clock Winds Down in Iowa\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve found Hillary Clinton leading in Iowa by 6-8 points on our last two polls,\u201d said Dean Debnam, President of Public Policy Polling in a press release. \u201cBernie Sanders will likely make up some ground from Martin O\u2019Malley voters moving toward him. To pull [off] the upset he will need large numbers of voters who aren\u2019t currently registered Democrats to show up on his behalf Monday night.\u201d\n\nThe poll found that Clinton supporters are the most committed of the Democratic electorate, with 88 percent firmly committed to her and reporting that they are unlikely to change their minds. Among Sanders supporters, 74 percent said the same.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The most recent polls out of Iowa show that, just days before Monday\u2019s caucuses, Hillary Clinton has a small lead over Bernie Sanders, averaging 2.5 percentage points in recent polls.
