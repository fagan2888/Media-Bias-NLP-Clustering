Four-star shooting guard Kevin Huerter verbally committed on Monday to play for the Maryland starting in the 2016-2017 season.

Huerter, a 6-foot-5, 180-pound shooting guard from Shenendehowa High School in Clifton Park, New York, announced his intentions on Monday afternoon via his Twitter page.

“I am excited to announce I have committed to the University of Maryland!” he wrote.

Huerter averaged 17.5 points, six rebounds and six assists for Shenendehowa last season as a junior and led the school to the Class AA State title.

Huerter is the 41st ranked player in the country in the ESPN 100 and the No. 11 shooting guard. He is ranked 80th in the Rivals 150.

He took an unofficial visit to the College Park campus this past weekend and joins 5-foot-11 point guard Anthony Cowan, from Olney, Maryland, as the second four-star commitment for the Terrapins in the Class of 2016.

Huerter also recently made visits to Notre Dame, Michigan and Villanova and held interest from Syracuse, Virginia, Marquette, and Miami, among others.

According to ESPN’s scouting report, Huerter’s strengths include being a “a long and lean shooting guard that is extremely skilled. He a lights out shooter off the catch and rhythm dribble. He is an excellent passer with a terrific feel for the game. He attacks and plays with great energy and urgency.”

The Terrapins will lose shooting guard Rasheed Sulaimon and small forward Jake Layman to graduation after this upcoming season, but Huerter is expected to join Dion Wiley at shooting guard.

Per NCAA rules, Maryland coach Mark Turgeon cannot officially comment on the commitment until Huerter signs his National Letter of Intent during the early signing period in mid-November.

Yet, Turgeon did write on his Twitter account on Monday afternoon, “Hope everyone enjoys their labor day … Great day to be a Terp!”
