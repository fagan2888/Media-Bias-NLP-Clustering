The genial Mr. Verrilli \u2014 who joked with Michael Kaelin that the proper way to address him is Gen. Verrilli \u2014 charmed a packed house in the Brubeck Room that overflowed into second-floor rooms where people watched on closed circuit TV, with lighthearted and serious stories of his long legal career. Mr. Kaelin, an attorney and chairman of the library\u2019s board of trustees, engaged Mr. Verrilli in conversation from the Brubeck Room stage.\n\n\u201cHow delighted I am to be here,\u201d he said. \u201cI have not lived here since 1975, but Wilton feels like home to me,\u201d the Wilton High School graduate said, acknowledging a number of people in the audience. Among them were his parents, Donald and Rose Marie Verrilli, a former first selectman.\n\nIn his position, which was created in 1870 for the purpose of helping the attorney general, he represents the United States before the U.S. Supreme Court, \u201cwhich means I represent all of you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is an awesome responsibility and an awesome privilege.\u201d\n\nThe most important part of his job, he said, is deciding what the position of the United States should be on the many cases that come before the Justice Department. \u201cThat\u2019s what I spend most of my time on,\u201d he said, adding that he can be overruled only by the attorney general or the president.\n\n\u201cArguing cases is a very small part of the job.\u201d\n\nHe explained that thousands of cases are litigated throughout the country that involve the government, and \u201cwe lose about 2,000 a year.\u201d\n\nOver the course of the year he reviews each of those lost cases, deciding whether they should be taken to the Court of Appeals and ultimately to the Supreme Court. His department will ask for Supreme Court review of only 10 to 15 cases.\n\nHe is assisted in this work by a staff of 21 career lawyers. Noting the amount of work those attorneys do on an $11-million budget, Mr. Verrilli said it is \u201cthe best bargain the American taxpayer gets.\u201d\n\nMr. Verrilli acknowledged his job has had a higher profile than that of most previous solicitors general. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very unusual place in history,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not usual for so many high-profile cases to come before the Supreme Court\u201d in a short span of time. Some of those he has argued involve the Affordable Care Act, the Defense of Marriage Act and EPA rules regarding emission of gases that affect climate change.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a time when a majority of the Supreme Court has a strong ideological perspective different from the president,\u201d he said, adding that, \u201caside from the New Deal, this is probably the greatest amount of friction between the executive and judicial branches.\u201d\n\nDeath row defense\n\nMr. Verrilli made a point of saying he believed he benefited from an excellent education at Wilton High School, after which he went on to graduate from Yale University and Columbia School of Law. He went on to clerk for J. Skelly Wright of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and then U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr.\n\nHe went into private practice as a litigator specializing in telecommunications, media and the First Amendment. In that capacity, he argued a dozen cases before the Supreme Court.\n\nFive of those cases constituted pro bono work for inmates facing the death penalty. It is this work, he said, that he felt influenced his path to his current position, although not in an obvious way.\n\n\u201cIf you came out of law school in the 80s and planned a career to be solicitor general, the last thing you\u2019d do is represent people on death row,\u201d he said.\n\nNevertheless, he added, \u201chad I not done that work I am 100% certain I would not have this job.\n\n\u201cThe experience that made me remotely qualified came out of that work.\u201d\n\nIt is experience, he said, that teaches someone how to be a lawyer.\n\nMr. Verrilli moved to Washington, D.C., in the 80s to be a law clerk, and stayed because he thought \u201cit was a great climate to be a lawyer\u201d and he had ideas about perhaps someday working in government.\n\n\u201cThe next thing I know I\u2019m 50 years old and have 20-plus years in private practice.\u201d\n\nWhen Barack Obama was elected president, he decided to take the plunge into public service and he took a job in the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cMost people \u2014 my wife, my daughter, my parents \u2014 thought I was nuts,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cBut I decided it was time to do it, and it worked out pretty good.\n\n\u201cI did what I thought was right and I didn\u2019t let ego get in the way.\u201d\n\nIn 2009 President Obama named him associate United States deputy attorney general within the Department of Justice. In 2010 he moved to the White House as deputy counsel to the president.\n\nGenetics\n\nOne of the stories Mr. Verrilli told involves some back-to-school work. In April 2013, he represented the United States before the Supreme Court in a case that asked if a human gene could be patented (Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics).\n\n\u201cMy science education stopped when I was a sophomore at Wilton High,\u201d he said. The court was being asked to decide if, when a human gene is extracted from a body and isolated, it can be patented. Products of nature cannot be patented, but inventions can be.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a question of science,\u201d he told his audience. \u201cI had no idea.\u201d\n\nBut he had to argue the government\u2019s side \u2014 which was opposed to the idea of a patent \u2014 and he had to understand the science.\n\nOne perk of his job, he said, is to have myriad government experts at his disposal, and Francis S. Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health \u2014 previously head of the Human Genome Project \u2014 consulted with him and then sent a team of \u201cthree genius scientists\u201d who gave Mr. Verrilli a three-hour tutorial on genetics.\n\n\u201cI understood it well enough to argue the case,\u201d he said, but \u201cthe only people who knew less about genetics than me were the nine who were deciding the case.\u201d\n\nHe had to come up with a simple but accurate way to explain the issue, \u201cand so we came up with a metaphor of a chicken lays an egg, which consists of a yolk, the white, and the shell.\n\n\u201cWhen you crack the egg, you separate the yolk and the white from the shell. Would you say it\u2019s no longer a product of nature, it\u2019s an invention?\n\n\u201cYou take the gene out of the body. Nobody thinks the yolk would be an invention.\u201d\n\nOther attorneys in the case argued their sides, and eventually the court decided unanimously that human genes may not be patented.\n\nIntegrity\n\nWhen asked by Mr. Kaelin to address the students \u2014 perhaps some potential attorneys \u2014 in the audience, Mr. Verrilli explained he is present when all his staff attorneys argue cases in court.\n\n\u201cOne thing that is incredibly clear is that nothing matters more when you are trying to persuade people than maintaining your integrity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is important the people you are trying to persuade \u2026 they need to trust you. They may not agree with you, but the minute you lose their trust, you lose it forever. When they find you\u2019ve not told the truth, they never trust you again. When you\u2019re an advocate, that\u2019s the worst that can happen.\n\n\u201cBe scrupulous and straightforward and they will hear what you have to say.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. visited the Wilton Library on Thursday, May 22.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Wilton Bulletin", "description": "U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. visited the Wilton Library on Thursday, May 22.", "title": "U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli: Telling tales of life in the capital | Wilton Bulletin", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://wiltonbulletin.hanewsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2014/05/Verrilli.jpg", "url": "http://www.wiltonbulletin.com/18854/u-s-solicitor-general-donald-verrilli-telling-tales-of-life-in-the-capital/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Wilton Bulletin", "description": "U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. visited the Wilton Library on Thursday, May 22.", "creator": "@wiltonbulletin", "image": {"src": "http://wiltonbulletin.hanewsmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2014/05/Verrilli.jpg"}, "title": "U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli: Telling tales of life in the capital | Wilton Bulletin", "site": "@wiltonbulletin", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 135461246469434}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WiltonBulletin", "section": "Library News", "tag": "Wilton Library", "published_time": "2014-06-02T13:00:57+00:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc9bd\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Kaelin, an attorney and chairman of the library\u2019s board of trustees, engaged Mr. Verrilli in conversation from the Brubeck Room stage.\nSolicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. faces down the U.S. Supreme Court on a regular basis, representing the United States on any number of cases throughout the judicial term.\n\u201cIt is not usual for so many high-profile cases to come before the Supreme Court\u201d in a short span of time.\nGeneticsOne of the stories Mr. Verrilli told involves some back-to-school work.\nHis department will ask for Supreme Court review of only 10 to 15 cases."}
