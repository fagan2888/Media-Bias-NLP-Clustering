In 2011, GM announced it was investing $380 million in its existing plant to produce the Colorado and Canyon.\n\n\"It's nice to have the confidence of a worldwide brand like GM investing now half a billion dollars,\u201d said Gov. Nixon.\n\nMore than 1,600 jobs are expected to be added in Wentzville as a result of the truck production. There are also jobs created from sub-suppliers connected to auto production.\n\n\u201cThey go out to eat in our local restaurants, they buy homes in here, they go to the local vendors to buy products and services,\u201d said Wentzville Mayor Nick Guccione. \u201cSo it\u2019s helped us tremendously.\u201d\n\nWorkers at Stefanina\u2019s Pizzeria and Restaurant said deliveries to the GM plant keep them busy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very busy, we send a lot of food over there,\u201d said Samantha Gnade, bartender and server. She believes the new pickups will be a hit with consumers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a full sized truck. It\u2019s not an SUV. It kind of fits a different market,\u201d said Gande.\n\nGuccione believes the city\u2019s tax incentives and it\u2019s educated workforce were key factors in GM investing in its Wentzville plant.\n\n\u201cI look forward to working with GM for a long, long time.\u201d\n\nFact about the GM Wentzville plant\n\nDate Opened: 1983\n\nEmployment: 1800 hourly, 300 salary\n\nShifts: Two full shifts, with Stamping 3rd shift\n\nUnion representation: UAW Local 2250\n\nCurrent Products: The world\u2019s best full-size vans, the Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana\n\nUpcoming Products: GM\u2019s next generation mid-size pickup trucks, the 2015 Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon, scheduled to launch later in 2014.\n\nRecent Investments: GM announced the investment of $380 million in November 2011 for the launch of the new mid-size pickup at Wentzville, with the potential to create or retain 1,260 jobs.
