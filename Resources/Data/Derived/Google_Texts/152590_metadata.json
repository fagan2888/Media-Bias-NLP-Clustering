Today, it makes plastic components for medical devices, such as tubes for insulin pumps and handles for surgical tools.\n\nCi Medical changed its name in June to reflect that \u201cover the past decade we have been using 100 percent of our expertise to service customers in the medical and pharmaceutical device markets,\u201d CEO Robert Subasic Jr. said.\n\nThe medical industry offers more stability and opportunity for expansion, said Subasic, who joined the company in 2010 and was named chief executive in 2011. Previously, he was chief financial officer of Pittsburgh Brewing Co., the brewer of Iron City beer.\n\n\u201cThat's the next phase of our business,\u201d he said, referring to the company's interest in buying competitors. \u201cOur industry is ripe for consolidation.\u201d\n\nSubasic declined to name targets, but said the company is well capitalized thanks to its owner, Altaris Capital Partners, a New York private equity firm with $1.3 billion in assets. Altaris acquired the company from its founders, the Policastro family, eight years ago.\n\nThe company isn't new to acquisitions. In 2009, Ci Medical bought United Kingdom-based RW Injection Molding, giving it a European manufacturing presence. It also has factories in Puerto Rico, Mexico and Texas.\n\nThe United States remains the world's largest market for medical devices, valued at about $110 billion a year, and expected to reach $133 billion by 2016, according to the Commerce Department.\n\nCi Medical's sales were $65 million last year, and Subasic said he expects to hit $70 million this year, which would be an 8 percent increase.\n\nHe declined to name customers, but Western Pennsylvania is home to several large medical companies, including Bayer Corp. and Philips Respironics.\n\nEven with steady demand for health care products, the industry and Ci Medical have challenges. For one, runaway health care spending has led to efforts to control costs.\n\nWhile the company's customers are \u201calways looking for cost savings,\u201d Subasic said Ci Medical's growth has allowed it to take on contracts for larger volumes, \u201cwhich helps to alleviate the pain\u201d of tighter margins.\n\nAlso putting pressure on medical manufacturers is the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration, the federal agency tasked with ensuring the safety of medical devices.\n\n\u201cCertainly, health care is a growing industry,\u201d said John Manzetti, CEO of the Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse, a South Side incubator for health care companies. But not every manufacturing company can meet the standards for \u201cclean-room\u201d production, sterility of medical devices and other FDA requirements, he said.\n\nThat creates a high bar to enter the market, Manzetti said. \u201cYou have to be a very high-quality manufacturer.\u201d\n\nMedical device makers are being squeezed by a 2.3 percent excise tax levied by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOn a recent tour of Ci Medical's plant in Latrobe, visitors were required to don protective booties, hair nets and overcoats before entering the shop floor, where towering machines extrude plastic into hundreds of forms, such as tiny clips used in brain surgery and large tubes that go into insulin pumps.\n\nJeff MacKenzie, general manager of the plant, said the company replaced all its machinery over the past several years in favor of more-efficient, electric-powered presses that cut costs and are cleaner to operate.\n\n\u201cOur energy costs are down 30 percent, even with more business,\u201d he said.\n\nThe brightly lit space was highly automated \u2014 if parts aren't touched by humans, there's less chance of contamination \u2014 with robotic arms lifting plastic pieces from molds and dropping them into collection bins.\n\nThe company has about 550 employees worldwide, with 225 in Latrobe.\n\nThere may be pressures to reduce prices, become more efficient and meet regulations. But the company's future is bright because \u201cwe have an aging population, so the need for medical components is growing,\u201d Subasic said.\n\n\u201cOur industry is a growing industry.\u201d\n\nAlex Nixon is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
