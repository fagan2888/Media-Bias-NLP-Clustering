Leticia Van de Putte D-San Antonio, the 2014 Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, hugs one of her grandsons during a campaign event on June 4, 2014, in Austin.\n\nWith the chances of Texas Democrats winning a statewide office in November hinging largely on a higher turnout among Hispanics, the only Hispanic on their statewide ticket goes by the last name Van de Putte.\n\nOn the campaign trail, it is easy to see state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte embrace her Hispanic heritage. The lieutenant governor candidate \u2014 known in her San Antonio district as the pharmacist from the \u201cbarrio\u201d \u2014 peppers her speeches with Spanish, ending many with a \u201cmuch\u00edsimas gracias\u201d instead of a \u201cthank you so much.\u201d She has hosted a \u201cpachanga,\u201d or a Mexican party, in the Rio Grande Valley and regularly participates in interviews on the Spanish-language channel Univision.\n\nBut she is still working to introduce herself to most of the state. As she tries to build name identification statewide, her last name does not immediately resonate with many in the Hispanic community she hopes to draw to the polls in big numbers. And political observers say that for Van de Putte to stand a chance of defeating her Republican opponent, state Sen. Dan Patrick of Houston, motivating those Hispanic voters is a must.\n\nDespite her outreach efforts, Van de Putte has another challenge in making herself know to Hispanic voters who may not be tuned into politics until just before Election Day.\n\nSome point to the March Democratic primary as evidence of the bump a Hispanic name can provide. State Sen. Wendy Davis of Fort Worth handily won the Democratic nomination for governor. But she lost several border counties with large Hispanic populations to Ray Madrigal, a municipal court judge from Corpus Christi who reported no money raised or spent on his campaign.\n\nRepublicans said Davis lost the counties because of her support for abortion rights, but other analysts argued it was her low name identification in the region and being pitted against a candidate with a Hispanic surname.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the benefit that Ray Madrigal had\u201d in the race against Davis, said Sylvia Manzano, a senior analyst for the nonpartisan political polling organization Latino Decisions. \u201cVan de Putte doesn\u2019t come to the table with a familiar name.\u201d\n\nInstead Van de Putte must rely on more overt aspects of her campaign meant to serve as cues for voters about her heritage, Manzano said.\n\nVan de Putte\u2019s campaign has recently promoted a \u201cViva La Leti\u201d slogan, pushing it on social media and using it as a marquee for events.\n\nIn a recent interview, Van de Putte said it would be disrespectful to voters and Hispanics if she played up her heritage for political gain, and that she only intends to be genuine about her background despite perceptions of it being used as an outreach strategy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a conscious effort to emphasize or play up my heritage,\u201d Van de Putte said. \u201cIt\u2019s who I am.\u201d\n\nThe Hispanic vote is one both Democrats and Republicans have turned more attention to during this election cycle.\n\nAlthough less than a third of eligible voters in Texas are Hispanic, the Hispanic population is expected to become a plurality by 2020 as the state\u2019s demographics continue to shift. In 2012, only 39 percent of Hispanics in Texas eligible to vote cast a ballot in the presidential election. In that same election, 61 percent of eligible white Texans voted.\n\nMobilizing that voting bloc has become part of the Democrats\u2019 strategy to make gains in the state. And Republicans, both at the local and national levels, have started their own outreach efforts.\n\nVan de Putte\u2019s supporters hope she can draw a clear contrast with Patrick, who has attracted headlines \u2014 and criticism \u2014 over some of his comments on illegal immigration.\n\nDuring his primary campaign, Patrick described the influx of undocumented immigrants to Texas as an \u201cillegal invasion.\u201d In his runoff victory speech last month, Patrick struck a more conciliatory tone, saying he would work to make inroads with the state\u2019s Hispanic community.\n\n\u201cBefore you can get someone\u2019s vote, you have to respect them enough to go talk with them and explain who you are,\u201d Patrick said in the speech.\n\nThe Patrick campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nGuadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a political science professor at the University of Texas at Brownsville, said voters identify with a candidate who speaks their language and understands their traditions. But she argued that Van de Putte\u2019s campaign against Patrick could be more successful among Hispanic voters if she \u201cenriched\u201d her campaign with specific policy proposals to help the Hispanic community.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a successful Hispanic woman, and that in itself means a lot,\u201d Correa-Cabrera said. \u201cBut you have to take advantage of that to do something more and utilize that image to do something for the Hispanic community.\u201d\n\nVan de Putte has sought to differentiate herself from Patrick on crucial issues among Hispanics, including immigration and health care. Patrick opposes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and he is against allowing undocumented students to pay in-state tuition rates to attend public universities. Van de Putte has been a vocal supporter of in-state tuition and has talked about the need for immigration reform. Patrick staunchly opposes the Affordable Care Act; Van de Putte has endorsed it.\n\nWhile her understanding and connection with Hispanic voters could be beneficial, Lionel Sosa, a Republican media consultant who previously worked for George W. Bush, said Van de Putte\u2019s biggest challenge would be to raise enough money to spread her message.\n\n\u201cAn intimate knowledge of the needs and concerns of the Latino is always the key to serving this important group, but I doubt that she\u2019s running as a \u2018Latina for Latinos,\u2019\u201d Sosa said. \u201cMy sense is that she\u2019s running as a leader for all Texans.\u201d\n\nVan de Putte agreed and emphasized that she is running to create a better future for all Texans. But she added that her Hispanic heritage \u2014 like her professional career in health care and her role as a mother \u2014play into who she is as a leader and the issues she is concerned about.\n\nWhile it may be odd for individuals outside of South Texas to realize how much of her personality and daily life are a product of her bicultural upbringing, it all falls into the fact that voters in Texas are not accustomed to seeing Hispanic females run for high office.\n\n\u201cSome people say, \u2018She\u2019s playing it up,\u2019 but it\u2019s just my regular day. It\u2019s who I am,\u201d Van de Putte said. \u201cI\u2019m Leticia San Miguel \u2014 Van de Putte.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Political analysts say that state Sen.
