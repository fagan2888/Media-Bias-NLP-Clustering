HASTINGS, Mich. (WOOD) — The Board of Trustees for Pennock Health Services released a statement on the healthcare provider’s website confirming they have signed a letter of intent to be affiliated with Spectrum Health.

In the statement the board said an affiliation with Spectrum will allow them to expand services and give patients more access to specialists, while keeping costs down.

Obtaining an affiliation has been in the works for about two years in Pennock’s strategic plan.

Plans for a new hospital were announced earlier this year, it’s not known how or if this new affiliation may impact those plans.

The healthcare provider’s website states, ” Spectrum Health has pledged to work with us to perform a joint master facility planning process that will evaluate the existing facility and the configuration of services at the Ferris site.” The statement goes on to say, “We are looking forward to determining what services should be delivered and how they might be delivered in the most efficient and cost effective manner possible.”
