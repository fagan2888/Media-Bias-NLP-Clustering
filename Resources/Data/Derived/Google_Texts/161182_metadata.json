Some are uninsured. Others are being pushed into the new exchanges because their employers \u2014 companies that include Trader Joe\u2019s and Home Depot \u2014 decided to drop coverage for part-timers.\n\n\u201cJaime,\u201d for example, is a nursing student who lives in Redlands, Calif., and works 20 to 25 hours per week at a local Home Depot. (He asked that his last name not be used, fearing repercussions at work.) Jaime spends almost $4,000 a year for a health insurance policy that Home Depot offers to part-timers, covering both him and his wife. But the company will stop offering that benefit at the end of this year because it says the coverage doesn\u2019t meet the standards of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSo Jaime has been shopping for a policy on the California exchange, and says he\u2019s pleasantly surprised. \u201cThe program would be an improvement,\u201d he says, because the policy costs about the same as his old plan, but there are no lifetime caps on coverage like there were on the Home Depot policy.\n\nMost corporate-sponsored health care plans for part-time workers don\u2019t provide very good coverage, says Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, and an expert of the new health care marketplaces. And workers for companies like Trader Joe\u2019s, which has a fairly good health plan for part-timers, may suddenly find they can do better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very likely that these part-time workers will get a better deal in the new marketplaces,\u201d Levitt says. Trader Joe\u2019s, for example, will offer cash to part-timers starting in January to help pay for their insurance, and many of the workers will be eligible for tax credits to help them pay their premiums. \u201cSo they\u2019re likely to be much better off,\u201d Levitt says.\n\nTrader Joe\u2019s says it believes 70 percent of its part-time workers will pay less for comparable coverage in the health care exchanges. But that leaves 30 percent who could pay more, including \u201cJane,\u201d a student and mother of two. \u201cIt\u2019s really disheartening,\u201d she says. I\u2019m absolutely disappointed by it.\u201d\n\nJane, who didn\u2019t want her real name used because the company discourages its employees from talking to the press, works fewer than 30 hours a week at a Trader Joe\u2019s in Austin, Texas.\n\n\u201cI would say that the insurance that I get through Trader Joe\u2019s right now is some of the best insurance that I\u2019ve received as an adult,\u201d she says.\n\nTrying to match that coverage and price hasn\u2019t been easy. Jane hasn\u2019t yet been able to get a firm quote from healthcare.gov, but says her best estimate so far has been disappointing: a premium of at least $350 a month \u2014$4,200 a year \u2014 for her family of four.\n\n\u201c[That\u2019s] versus the $200 a month I\u2019m paying right now,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not even taking into account the difference in benefits.\u201d\n\nAnd Jane says she\u2019s troubled by the results from another calculator on the Kaiser Family Foundation website that estimates the family\u2019s annual premiums will be more than $9,500. That\u2019s partly because the site judges that her family isn\u2019t eligible for any state subsidies.\n\n\u201cAs a resident of Texas, either way I look at it, I\u2019m getting a reduction in benefits and an increase in price by moving to the government exchange,\u201d Jane says.\n\nOne reason may be that Texas, like a number of other states, has not expanded its Medicaid program. Levitt says that\u2019s led to a sort of Catch-22.\n\n\u201cIn states that don\u2019t expand Medicaid,\u201d Levitt says, \u201cyou end up with this \u2018gap group\u2019 \u2014 people who are not poor enough or don\u2019t have the right family circumstances to qualify for Medicaid but, ironically, don\u2019t make enough to qualify for tax credits.\u201d\n\nSo, says Levitt, whether you\u2019re going to be better off in the government marketplaces can have a lot to do with what state you live in. Still he says, in general, the exchanges will benefit part-time workers.\n\nEmployers are not required to provide coverage for these workers, Levitt says, \u201cand they are likely better off getting subsidized coverage in the marketplace.\u201d\n\nAnd, he adds, it\u2019s likely that the exchanges will benefit from an influx of part-time workers, since they tend to be younger and healthier than average.\n\n[Image source: Flickr user Travis Hornung]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Across the U.S., many part-time workers have joined the millions shopping for coverage in the new health care marketplace.
