Sioux Falls, SD

Today, twelve women and thirteen men anxiously awaited being named this year's Mr. and Miss Basketball of South Dakota. In the end two very deserving individuals were awarded the honor, with each being the first in their school's history.

"The 2015 Miss South Dakota Basketball, Alexys Swedlund," Jim Hensley announced.

It was no surprise that Saint Thomas More's all-time leading scorer was chosen as this year's Miss Basketball. In her five years on the varsity level Swedlund not only led the Lady Cavaliers to their first tournament appearance, but also to three titles.

"It's such an honor to be able to represent West River and especially St. Thomas More. I'm proud to be the first from there to win this award and hopefully many more after me can also," Swedlund said.

It was a much closer race for Mr. Basketball, but in the end a very deserving candidate was selected.

"The 2015 South Dakota Mr. Basketball is Bo Fries," Hensley announced.

The 6'4" senior averaged nearly 22 points a game while leading Langford Area to their fourth consecutive state tournament. Fries will graduate with a 4.0 GPA and 1,634 career points to his name. However winning this coveted award is the icing on the cake.

"This is definitely at the top of my list. I had a great career, got to play with a lot of great people, and coaches in a great community. It has been a lot of fun. It's definitely a big honor. Of all of the great players in South Dakota that could have received this award, to be among the top of them is definitely a big honor for me," Fries said.

This is not the end of the road for Fries or Swedlund. Bo will take his talents down the road to Northern St. As for Alexys, she will begin her career at Washington St. this fall. Needless to say being the crowned the best in their class lets them both know they can play at the collegiate level.

"Yeah it does build a little bit of confidence, so going out there I know I can compete with those girls and play at that level. I can't wait to get out there," Swedlund said.

"I'm looking forward to going to Northern St. and getting to play with some of the guys that are here today, it should be a lot of fun. It does give me confidence, but it's still going to be tough adjusting to the next level. It's a challenge that I'm looking forward to though," Fries said.
