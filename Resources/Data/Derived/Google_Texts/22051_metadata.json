Now Fox News rival CNN is poised to cash in on that success.\n\nThe news network is asking advertisers to pay 40 times its usual rate, or as much as $200,000 for a 30-second commercial, during the second GOP debate, which it is scheduled to host on Sept. 16, according to Ad Age. CNN is also charging $50,000 to $60,000 for commercials airing that day in the earlier debate between second-tier candidates.\n\nRelated: Two New Polls Show Exactly Why Donald Trump Is Winning\u200b\u200b\n\nAd Age says CNN isn\u2019t expected to pull in quite the same level of viewership as Fox News did, but even if the next primetime debate fails to match the earlier numbers, it is still likely to be the most-watched debate CNN has ever aired. The network can thank Trump for that, just as it could thank another outspoken and unpredictable GOP phenomenon for helping to set its previous debate record: In 2008, almost 11 million viewers tuned in to the vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and \u2014 you betcha! \u2014 Sarah Palin.\n\nIf the Palin example holds, news networks aren\u2019t going to be the only ones to benefit from the Trump surge. \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d saw its viewership and buzz soar in 2008 as Tina Fey\u2019s impersonation of Palin became a sensation in its own right. And when the former Alaska governor appeared on SNL in October 2008, the show drew its highest ratings in 14 years.\n\nRelated: Trump Is Still Surging \u2014 Here\u2019s Who Can Stop Him\u200b\u200b\n\nThe new season of SNL starts Oct. 3, so it\u2019s probably a safe bet that Lorne Michaels \u2014 and other executives at NBC, even after the network dumped Trump from The Celebrity Apprentice in the wake of his comments about Mexican immigrants \u2014 are rooting for Trump mania to keep going for another month, at least. In the meantime, NBC announced Tuesday that Trump will appear on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d next week.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Fox News\u2019s GOP debate last month generated blockbuster ratings \u2014 24 million viewers saw Donald Trump and the other top Republican presidential contenders mix it up, making it the most-watched non-sports cable show ever.
