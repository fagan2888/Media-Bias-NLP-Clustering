The disastrous Healthcare.gov rollout, the hapless attempts at damage control (\"tech surge\" -- really, Mr. President?), the finger-pointing -- the entire clusterfudge is the media obsession of the moment. And in one of our favorite corners of the media, late-night TV, Stephen Colbert went exploring the ruins.\n\nIf you're having trouble navigating Healthcare.gov, it turns out you can apply for Obamacare in person with the help of a certified \"navigator.\" Colbert devoted two segments of Wednesday night's \"Colbert Report\" to visiting the Foodbank of Monmouth and Ocean Counties in New Jersey, where one such navigator, Debbie Palacios, works. We're showing you the second of the two segments below. (The first, which includes a brief -- and equally torturous -- interview with the food bank's executive director, you can watch here.)\n\nSimon Dumenco is the \"Media Guy\" media columnist for Advertising Age.
