It\u2019s not unexpected \u2014 basketball has been an ongoing theme during his presidency, a fact highlighted in a new book.\n\nHis opponents and critics have tried hard to use this annual March Madness \u201cpresidential\u201d ritual against Obama, noted Sports Illustrated Senior Writer Alexander Wolff. \u201cThis is something Americans do when March rolls around. This doesn\u2019t make you different \u2014 it makes you American,\u201d he pointed out.\n\nBasketball has been \u201ca touchstone in Obama\u2019s exercise of the power of the presidency,\u201d said Wolff. The president used it to attract pro basketball players \u201cto help save the Affordable Care Act,\u201d the president\u2019s landmark legislation. \u201cThe Obama White House used NBA players \u2014 former and current \u2014 to rally sign-ups for the Affordable Care Act. He [the president] needed young people and middle-aged people, and the NBA is a great way to reach these people.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the Obama administration \u201chit the target\u201d in ACA signups, said Wolff. \u201cNobody in Washington thought they would do it. Basketball has something to do with that.\u201d\n\nWolff has authored or co-authored six other books about basketball, but his latest book, The Audacity of Hoop: Basketball and the Age of Obama (Temple University Press), is his first that uniquely involved a U.S. president. It charts in five main essays, 15 sidebars, and over 125 images the 44th president\u2019s love of basketball, beginning with him as a 10-year-old with the only Christmas present from his Kenyan father, a basketball. He used his love of basketball to explore and cement his racial identity through courting his future wife, through his first presidential campaign, and throughout his historic two terms in Washington\n\nIt is \u201cequal parts biographical sketch, political narrative, and cultural history,\u201d but \u201cit is not a 500-page history [book],\u201d declared Wolff in a recent MSR phone interview.\n\nObama isn\u2019t the first U.S. president for whom sport played an integral part in his life \u2014 Dwight Eisenhower played golf, for example, and Richard Nixon often called in football plays.\n\n\u201cI do think [Obama] is more closely identified with basketball than any other president, maybe more than Eisenhower with golf,\u201d stated Wolff. Basketball furthermore reflects 21st century American life, he continued. \u201cI believe the Obama era is actively reflected by basketball not because he is an African American\u2026 Basketball is not stereotypically African American. It is the new America.\u201d\n\nHis campaign people at first advised Obama against playing basketball on the 2008 campaign trail in fear that his opponents would use it against him, explained Wolff. \u201cI know his own campaign was a little bit hesitant to have him play basketball\u2026 They didn\u2019t want him to fit into some stereotype narrative.\u201d\n\nBut after Obama played pickup basketball with potential voters in New Hampshire, it became an expected exercise for him, even on Election Day 2008. Some say his cool-headed decision-making skills may be directly related to his playing style, willing to do whatever is needed to achieve the greater good, comparable to playing pickup \u2014 win and stay, lose and wait your turn.\n\nAsked if it\u2019s a sports book, a modern history book, or perhaps something political, Wolff said both he and the publishers wrestled with this question prior to its December release. But the book cover gives it away. \u201cHe [Obama] is going behind his back with the basketball. He\u2019s not just posing with it. He\u2019s being active, graceful and skilled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a basketball book,\u201d declared Wolff. \u201cA lot of the book is about that. I wish I could have gotten a one-on-one with him.\u201d He believes even those who are not fans of the president but love basketball \u201cmight be drawn\u201d to the book as well.\n\nThe president has a copy of his book, said Wolff. \u201cI made sure a copy went down to the White House, and an extra copy to Pete [Souza, the White House official photographer]. Pete reported back that he [Obama] got a kick out of it and was showing it around the day he got it\u201d at a National Security Council meeting. \u201cHe loves the pictures, because it brings back a lot of memories.\u201d\n\nCharles Hallman welcomes reader responses to challman@spokesman-recorder.com.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "MSR News Online", "description": "President Barack Obama next week will publicly release his final NCAA tournament bracket predictions as commander-in-chief.", "title": "New book features Obama as hoops fan | MSR News Online", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://spokesman-recorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/SOE.obama-2.33.edit_.jpg", "height": 750}, "updated_time": "2016-03-13T17:41:09-05:00", "url": "http://spokesman-recorder.com/2016/03/09/new-book-features-obama-hoops-fan/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MNSpokesman.Recorder", "section": "Sports", "published_time": "2016-03-09T20:45:52-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-13T17:41:09-05:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://spokesman-recorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-msr-favicon-270x270.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Obama White House used NBA players \u2014 former and current \u2014 to rally sign-ups for the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cI believe the Obama era is actively reflected by basketball not because he is an African American\u2026 Basketball is not stereotypically African American.\nThe president used it to attract pro basketball players \u201cto help save the Affordable Care Act,\u201d the president\u2019s landmark legislation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a basketball book,\u201d declared Wolff.\nPresident Barack Obama next week will publicly release his final NCAA tournament bracket predictions as commander-in-chief."}
