A boost in hospital admissions led to robust third-quarter earnings for HCA (HCA) as the nation’s largest hospital operator also announced a deal to acquire a smaller urgent-care provider.

The Nashville, Tenn.-based company earned $1.16 a share, a 47% increase from Q3 ’13. Excluding asset-sale losses and other items, earnings were $1.18 a share. Revenue rose 9% to $9.22 billion.

Official Wall Street estimates were for earnings of $1.06 on revenue of $9.12 billion. But HCA recently pre-announced that it earn $1.16 on $9.22 billion in revenue.

HCA also announced a deal where it will buy CareNow, a privately held company that operates two dozen urgent-care centers in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The deal’s terms weren’t disclosed. The acquisition is expected to close sometime in the fourth quarter, HCA said.

For the three-month period ended Sept. 30, same facility admissions rose 2.8% from a year earlier, reflecting “improving payer and service mix,” CEO Milton Johnson said in a statement.

The increasing number of people getting health insurance under ObamaCare has led to more patients, more hospital visits and more money for certain health care providers.

The company reaffirmed its recently increased full-year guidance of $4.40 to $4.60 a share on revenue of $36.5 billion to $37 billion.

Last, but not least, HCA said it will repurchase as much as $1 billion of its shares.

Shares were down 2.2% in late morning trade in the stock market today. HCA stock is up 45% this year. The company currently has an IBD Composite Rating of 93, meaning that it trades better than 93% of other publicly traded businesses.

It’s the sixth consecutive quarter of EPS growth for HCA and the 11th straight quarter of revenue growth.

Late Monday, Universal Health Services (UHS) reported that it earned $1.36 a share in Q3, beating analyst views by a penny and up 23.6% from a year earlier.

The King of Prussia, Pa.-based company said its earnings were negatively affected by a $65 million settlement of a shareholder class-action lawsuit, expenses incurred by implementing electronic records and costs related to paying off debt.
