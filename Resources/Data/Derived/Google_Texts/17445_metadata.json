The problem is that, like many parts of the law, the rules are unclear...\n\nHealth Partners America (http://www.healthpartnersamerica.com), a company that provides training, tools, and technology solutions for insurance agents and employers who are navigating the health reform legislation, announces the release of its new white paper \u2013 2015 Transition Relief. This very timely 14-page document was written to help health insurance agents and brokers better advise their clients about the transition into ACA-compliant plans and the law\u2019s employer mandate.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) has a huge impact on both individuals and employers, but that impact is different for different market segments. Individuals and families, for instance, can purchase health coverage regardless of pre-existing conditions, but the \u201cguaranteed issue\u201d provision and enhanced benefits drive up the price significantly for anyone who doesn\u2019t qualify for a government subsidy. Many small employers will also see their premiums increase due to the new community rating rules. Large employers, on the other hand, are not as susceptible to rate hikes but could pay a penalty if they fail to offer affordable coverage.\n\nTo make the transition a little easier for individuals and employers, the law provides several forms of relief for those who qualify. The problem is that, like many parts of the law, the rules are unclear and many people have had trouble determining if they can take advantage of the money-saving options.\n\nFor example, in the individual and small group markets, which are more impacted by the market reforms than the large group market, insurance companies have the option of renewing old, non-compliant plan designs through October, 2016, but they don\u2019t have to make the same decisions for each line of business and states can block this practice. There\u2019s also some confusion about whether bigger companies that originally purchased coverage in the small group market but have since added employees will be able to renew their existing plans.\n\nFor large employers, there are several different types of transition relief. One option allows certain companies with non-calendar-year plans to wait until renewal time to get into compliance, but eligibility is based on the percentage of employees eligible or enrolled in coverage on a fixed date in the past. Another option allows companies with fewer than 100 employees to avoid shared responsibility penalties in 2015, but only if they keep doing what they were doing before. This may require companies that already offered group health coverage to keep doing so in 2015 while those who haven\u2019t offered coverage in the past may be able to wait another year. And for larger employers who are required to provide health coverage in 2015, a third option reduces the penalty if they choose to drop their plan altogether.\n\n\u201cThis is just another example of why agents need to study the law,\u201d says Mel Blackwell, CEO of Health Partners America. \u201cMany of the news stories about transition relief have been misreported, causing both employers and agents to make bad decisions.\u201d Blackwell tells the story of an agent who advised a 75-person group that they could drop their coverage in 2015 and pay no penalties, which is actually incorrect. \u201cThe agent made two mistakes,\u201d says Blackwell. \u201cFirst, he didn\u2019t realize that employers who drop their coverage don\u2019t qualify for the transition relief, and second, the penalty calculations are different for companies with more or less than 100 employees.\u201d\n\nBlackwell is quick to point out, though, that dropping coverage was actually the right decision for this particular group. \u201cA lot of companies will do well to abandon their group health plan and let their employees take advantage of the government subsidies,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut they do need to understand the financial implications of the decision. Even if it\u2019s the right thing to do, you don\u2019t want to surprise your client with a 90-thousand-dollar bill from the IRS.\u201d\n\nHealth Partners America is offering the full report at no cost through the company\u2019s website.\n\nAbout Health Partners America\n\nSince 2007, Health Partners America has been providing game-changing training and solutions to agents and brokers nationwide.
