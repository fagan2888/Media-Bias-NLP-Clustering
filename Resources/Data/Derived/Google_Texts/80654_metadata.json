Kentucky race turns on abuse claim, but which way? Ex-girlfriend\u2019s charge may motivate backers of GOP gubernatorial candidate James Comer.\n\nLEXINGTON, Ky. \u2014 It would be an ironic end to a bitter campaign: The allegations of domestic abuse that threatened James Comer\u2019s bid to be the next governor of Kentucky may instead propel him to victory in Tuesday\u2019s primary election.\n\nVeteran political hands in the Bluegrass State say the charges from an ex-girlfriend he dated in college, which Comer fiercely denies, have stoked indignation among his supporters and may energize them just enough to pull ahead in the closely fought contest.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt\u2019s a function of what election forecasters expect to be abysmally low turnout and a razor-close finish. The candidates have spent the final few days scouring for votes and any slight edge that might put them over the top. Comer, the state agriculture commissioner, is virtually tied with businessmen Matt Bevin and Hal Heiner, according to recent polls. Former state Supreme Court justice Will T. Scott is polling a distant fourth.\n\nThe abuse allegations, which emerged earlier this month, have shaken up the race in unpredictable ways \u2014 and each camp hopes they work in its favor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more motivated to see Comer win now than I was before,\u201d said Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who predicted an eight-point Comer victory.\n\nComer has worked assiduously to paint the abuse allegations as a smear driven by Heiner, long considered his leading rival for the nomination after spending $4.2 million of his own money on the race.\n\n\u201cHate\u2019s a fantastic emotion in politics, and there\u2019s plenty of hatred \u2026 right now from Jamie Comer\u2019s supporters against Hal Heiner,\u201d said Ted Jackson, a Kentucky Republican strategist.\n\nHeiner has disavowed any role in the allegations coming out, but Comer\u2019s allies have returned to the assertion repeatedly to paint Heiner as a dirty campaigner. And Heiner\u2019s running mate has been connected to a controversial blogger who has been pushing the abuse story on Comer for months.\n\n\u201cHal\u2019s complete fabrication about his involvement in this story is just \u2014 it really is creating a backlash,\u201d said former Rep. Anne Northup, a Comer supporter. \u201cIt\u2019s just beyond belief.\u201d\n\nHeiner has countered that Comer is taking advantage of the sordid allegations to gin up his supporters. In an ad released Friday, he accused Comer and Bevin of trying to make political hay out of domestic violence. Comer rejects the suggestion but acknowledges that the dispute could work in his favor. \u201cThe people that know me are really fired up \u2014 the people that know me well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to close this race out.\u201d\n\nBevin, meanwhile, who was left for dead after a failed challenge to Sen. Mitch McConnell in last year\u2019s GOP Senate primary, has proven to be an adroit campaigner with a flair for retail politics that has helped resurrect his fortunes. Though McConnell was long expected to stand in Bevin\u2019s way, there\u2019s been little evidence \u2014 beyond vocal opposition from McConnell allies \u2014 that the Senate majority leader has done anything to prevent Bevin\u2019s comeback.\n\nWhile Comer and Heiner have attacked each other, Bevin has sought to portray himself as the most serious candidate in the race. He\u2019s spent the final few days emphasizing his humble upbringing, military service and experience in the pension business as his qualifications to lead Kentucky. Many Republicans who spoke with POLITICO Campaign Pro said Comer and Heiner ignored Bevin for too long, presuming his candidacy wouldn\u2019t gain traction.\n\nEstablishment Republicans worry that he\u2019d fare worst against the near-certain Democratic nominee, Attorney General Jack Conway. Bevin still has baggage from last year\u2019s Senate race, including a perception as a strident tea party ally with little appeal to mainstream Republicans.\n\n\u201cI have two words to say to any Republican who supports Matt in this primary,\u201d said Bill Stone, a former chairman of the Jefferson County Republican Party and Heiner supporter. \u201cThose two words are: Gov. Conway.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are hoping to take over the governorship after eight years of Democratic control under the popular, term-limited incumbent Steve Beshear. A victory in Kentucky would give the GOP control of 32 of the nation\u2019s statehouses.\n\nBut despite Kentucky\u2019s solid-red status in federal elections, Democrats have more than held their own at the state level. They\u2019ve won seven of the past eight gubernatorial elections, and they still control the state House.\n\n\u201cKentucky still ranks at the bottom or near the bottom in every category. We haven\u2019t really had a governor who\u2019s been able to move the needle much for Kentucky for quite some time,\u201d said Terry Stephens, a Republican donor who supports Comer.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why this election is so damned important,\u201d added Stone.\n\nOn the ground, the Republican candidates will be competing for distinct pockets of votes. Bevin and Heiner hail from vote-rich eastern Kentucky, which includes Democratic-leaning population centers of Louisville, Lexington and their surrounding suburbs. Comer, meanwhile, is the only candidate from rural western Kentucky and is likely to fair better among voters who view even Republicans from the cities with skepticism.\n\nAnother wildcard is the vote from southeastern Kentucky, dominated by loyalists to Rep. Hal Rogers, who\u2019s butted heads with Comer on hemp legalization efforts. If Heiner can eat into Comer\u2019s support in this territory, he could prevail. But Bevin\u2019s strength in the Cincinnati suburbs could erode Heiner\u2019s base. Bevin won the endorsement of the Cincinnati Enquirer and came an eyelash away from beating McConnell in populous Boone County in last year\u2019s Senate race.\n\nEven Scott, who captures about 8 percent in polls, could be a difference-maker. Asked about the viciousness of the primary, Scott called it symptoms of a growing Kentucky Republican Party.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing in this race is nothing more than growing pains,\u201d he said, adding that any of his rivals would make good governors. \u201cThey\u2019re all great people, and if they get lucky enough to beat me, I don\u2019t care if they make me mad. I\u2019m going to support them.\u201d\n\nThat cold calculus has been dominant in a race that\u2019s featured little obvious division on policy. The candidates talk predictably about jobs and education, touting their diverse backgrounds as proof that they \u2014 not their opponents \u2014 are uniquely qualified to juice the Kentucky economy.\n\n\u201cMy background has been job attraction. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to work with hundreds of companies,\u201d Heiner said in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t have to read about it or learn about it. I\u2019ve lived it my entire life.\u201d\n\nAll of the candidates say they would like to do away with the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange, KyNect \u2014 though only Bevin and Scott advocate completely dismantling it, while Heiner and Comer have advocated keeping certain pieces. Bevin has swiped at Heiner on guns, arguing that Heiner\u2019s lone vote on gun policy came as a Louisville city councilor when he rejected a concealed carry measure.\n\nHeiner ripped Bevin for the criticism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolute mischaracterization. Matt will say anything to get elected,\u201d he said.\n\nHeiner said he\u2019d maintain the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, but he\u2019d model it after other Republican-led states that have approved versions that rely primarily on private sector insurance coverage.\n\nThough Republicans are sharply divided, there\u2019s general agreement than any of the three potential victors would be better than Conway, which has some in the GOP worried that the bitter race could damage their ultimate nominee.\n\nStone compared it to a string of nationwide Republican losses in campaigns they were favored to win. \u201cWe had Harry Reid in our sights. It was our year to beat Claire McCaskill,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did their work for them.\u201d\n\nAdding to the intensity of the negative campaign is the fact that super PACs for Comer and Heiner have been hurling haymakers at their opponents, a development not lost on Bevin.\n\n\u201cYou notice who doesn\u2019t have a super PAC blowing up their opposition?\u201d he asked reporters at a campaign stop in Lexington. \u201cWhy? Because I\u2019m running on issues. I don\u2019t need to attack other people or bring them down or smear them. \u2026 I\u2019m not going to get there by demeaning other people. If that\u2019s what it takes, I have no interest in being the governor.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Will backlash against abuse allegations propel James Comer to victory on Tuesday?", "title": "Kentucky race turns on abuse claim, but which way?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/kentucky-governor-primary-james-comer-matt-bevin-hal-heiner-118059.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/05/18/150518_james_comer_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Matt Bevin,Will T.
