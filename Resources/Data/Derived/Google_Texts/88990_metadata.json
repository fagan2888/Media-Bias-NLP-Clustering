Officials have not released the identity of the attacker, but have said he is a 26-year-old Moroccan who had been flagged by European counterterrorism authorities.\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, who described the incident as a terrorist attack, has called for multinational meeting of top security officials.\n\nFrench President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande plans to meet three Americans who foiled the attack. They are friends from middle school, and two of them were members of the armed services, according to their family members.\n\nOne of the Americans, Airman 1st Class Spencer Stone, was stabbed and remained in the hospital Saturday, said the parents of his two friends. The Pentagon said his wounds were not life threatening.\n\n\n\nTwo of the three Americans and a Briton who subdued an attacker on a high-speed train traveling between Amsterdam and Paris on Saturday recount their ordeal to reporters. (AP)\n\nStone, who is stationed at Lajes Air Base in the Azores, was traveling with Spc. Alek Skarlatos, an Oregon National Guardsman, and a civilian friend, according to the Pentagon. Anthony Sadler, a student at Sacramento State University, is their civilian companion, according to their families.\n\nThe three Americans were on a weeks-long tour through Europe, enjoying time together after Skarlatos, 22, had been deployed to Afghanistan.\n\nIn Arras, where the train stopped after the attack, the men\u2019s heroics became clear.\n\nChris Norman, a British businessman who helped tie up the shooter once he was subdued, told TV reporters in Arras that the incident unfolded quickly and began when the sound of a gunshot rang out and passengers saw a train employee run past. When Norman looked up, he saw a man carrying a machine gun, prompting him to duck down in his seat. At that point, he said, three Americans sitting near him also took notice of the gunman and immediately took action.\n\n\u201cAlek said to Spencer, \u2018Go get him,\u2019 \u201d Norman said. \u201cSpencer jumped up and tackled him and actually started getting the terrorist under control.\u201d\n\nSkarlatos told reporters that despite the danger, his friend sprung to his feet.\n\n\u201cSpencer ran a good 10 meters to get to the guy and we didn\u2019t know that his gun wasn\u2019t working or anything like that. Spencer just ran anyway, and if anyone would\u2019ve gotten shot it would\u2019ve been Spencer, for sure.\u201d\n\nPassengers subdue gunman on train in France\n\nNorman said his first reaction was to hide, but after he saw the Americans fighting the attacker, he said he went to help them.\n\n\u201cSpencer caught the terrorist by the neck, and I grabbed his right arm,\u201d Norman said. \u201cWe managed to get him under control. I am not a hero. What I did was normal. It\u2019s a miracle the attack failed. I think his gun was jammed.\u201d\n\nSadler said even though Stone was injured in the scuffle, he went to aid an injured passenger.\n\n\u201cWithout his help he would\u2019ve died. That man was bleeding from his neck profusely,\u201d Sadler said.\n\nGen. Philip M. Breedlove, the commanding officer of the U.S. European Command, called the men heroes.\n\n\u201cActions like this clearly illustrate the courage and commitment our young men and women have all the time, whether they are on duty or on leave,\u201d Breedlove said in a statement released by the Pentagon. \u201cWe are extremely proud of their efforts and now are praying for our injured airman to have a speedy recovery.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, President Obama called Stone, Skarlatos and Sadler to commend and congratulate them for their courage and quick action, said White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz. \u201cThe President expressed his gratitude to these three individuals for their heroic actions forestalling an even greater tragedy . . . and expressed how proud all Americans are of their extraordinary bravery,\u201d Schultz said in a statement, adding that Obama wished Stone a full and speedy recovery.\n\nCalls for Tighter Security\n\nIn a tacit acknowledgment that security lapses may have led to the attack, Michel, the Belgian prime minister, on Saturday called for a multinational meeting of top security officials to tighten identity and baggage checks on the trains.\n\nBelgian and French police forces had already significantly stepped patrols on their high-speed trains, Michel\u2019s office said. But on one Saturday high-speed train trip between Brussels and Paris \u2013 the same route on which the attack took place \u2013 there were no special bag screenings, identity checks or uniformed security officers visible on the train.\n\nFrench Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said Saturday that the suspect\u2019s identity was still being established but that the man had identified himself as a 26-year-old of Moroccan origin. Cazeneuve said that the man\u2019s name corresponded to someone whom Spanish authorities think has ties to radical Islamist movements. He said that the suspect lived in Spain until last year.\n\nBelgian Justice Minister Koen Geens told reporters in Brussels that though French authorities are still checking the suspect\u2019s identity, a person under the name that he gave the authorities \u201cis known by our services.\u201d\n\nHe had been flagged by other European counterterrorism authorities as a potential jihadist, but \u201che was not known as someone dangerous,\u201d Geens said.\n\n\u201cWe get a lot of these names,\u201d he said, saying that it was important to balance monitoring with privacy concerns.\n\nFrench newspaper Le Voix du Nord cited security sources saying that the suspect had been seen on a plane to Turkey from Germany in May, and that he may also have visited Syria. The newspaper also said that he may have had connections to a foiled ring of Islamist attackers in Belgium in January.\n\nCazeneuve, the French interior minister, praised the quick work of the Americans, who he said had helped avert a far bloodier situation.\n\nThe Americans were \u201cparticularly courageous and showed great bravery in very difficult circumstances,\u201d Cazeneuve said Friday in Arras, in northern France, where the train came to a halt after the late-afternoon attack. He praised them for their \u201csangfroid,\u201d and said that without it, \u201cwe could have faced a terrible drama.\u201d\n\nA dual French-American citizen was wounded by a stray gunshot, Cazeneuve said.\n\nFrench authorities have been on heightened alert for terrorism since the January attacks on the Charlie Hebdo newsweekly and a Paris kosher supermarket left 20 dead, including the three attackers. Those men claimed ties to the Islamic State.\n\n[Charlie Hebdo assailants had military-style equipment]\n\nIn a sign of how concerned the French authorities were by the incident, the French president said in a statement late Friday that \u201ceverything is being done to shine light on this drama.\u201d\n\nBelgian authorities also opened an antiterrorism inquiry, saying that the suspect got on the train in Brussels. In January, Belgium also said that it had foiled a group of Islamist militants who had been planning attacks on Belgian soil.\n\nPrepared for a Major Assault\n\nThe incident began when a French man trying to go into a bathroom on the train came face to face with the shooter, who was inside, laden with weapons and ammunition, Cazeneuve said without naming the man, whom he said tried to subdue the shooter. That first attempt was met with gunfire, Cazeneuve said, which is when the Americans intervened.\n\nCazeneuve said the shooter was prepared to carry out a major assault on the train, carrying a Kalashnikov rifle with nine additional clips of ammunition, a 9mm pistol with another clip and a box cutter.\n\n\u201cAlek said that they were about 30 feet away and ran for him, and Spencer, the friend, got him down, and Alek took the gun and knocked him a few times with the butt of the gun,\u201d said Skarlatos\u2019s stepmother, Karen Skarlatos, by telephone. \u201cThen the shooter grabbed for a handgun, which they took away from him as well, and then he grabbed for a cutter, a box cutter or a knife or something.\u201d\n\nIn the struggle, Stone was injured by the knife, Karen Skarlatos said. But the men managed to hogtie the assailant and subdue him, she said. A shaky cellphone video of the outcome showed the subdued man, shirtless and in white pants, lying with his front on the floor of the train car, his legs tied up in the air.\n\nSkarlatos \u201cjust recently returned home from Afghanistan,\u201d his stepmother said. \u201cHe got home in July. He spent the greater part of a year over there. He has a warrior\u2019s heart. He\u2019s just a strong brave guy.\u201d She said he had been stationed outside of Bagram air base.\n\nSkarlatos studies at a local community college and works part time at a Costco, his stepmother said.\n\nStone, the injured Air Force servicemen, treated another wounded passenger after suffering his own injuries, said Sadler\u2019s father, who spoke to his son shortly after the attack.\n\n\u201cSpencer actually had some emergency medical training through the service,\u201d said Sadler\u2019s father, who is also named Anthony Sadler. \u201cThere was another passenger who had his throat sliced. Spencer didn\u2019t worry about his own injuries and was able to minister to the wounds.\u201d\n\nAnother witness told the French Liberation newspaper said that the shirtless attacker had been pursuing another person down the aisle of the train. The attacker tried to shoot. \u201cI heard \u2018click click,\u2019 \u201d said the witness, who was identified only as Damien. \u201cI thought it was a toy gun.\u201d\n\nThen \u201ca man with a green T-shirt, shaved head, arrived,\u201d he said. \u201cThey stood a few seconds face to face, and then the passenger jumped on him and wrestled him to the ground. The guy, he had\u201d guts.\n\nPresident Obama was briefed about the incident, the White House said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe President expressed his profound gratitude for the courage and quick thinking of several passengers, including U.S. service members, who selflessly subdued the attacker. While the investigation into the attack is in its early stages, it is clear that their heroic actions may have prevented a far worse tragedy,\u201d the statement said.\n\nHollande\u2019s office said that the French president spoke Saturday with the Americans to thank them for their efforts to foil the attack. He planned to meet them in coming days at the Elys\u00e9e Palace in Paris.\n\nThe incident is sure to raise fresh questions about European train security. The Thalys high-speed train is packed with businesspeople, government officials and others who commute from one European capital to another, but there are no metal detectors, X-ray machines or other security checks before boarding. The Eurostar train that runs through the channel tunnel between Paris and London has stronger security measures.\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Peter Holley contributed to this report, which was published originally in The Post on August 22, 2015.\n\nRead More at The Washington Post:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "PARIS \u2014 Three Americans who foiled a suspected terrorist attack on a packed high-speed", "title": "3 American Heroes Stop a Terrorist on a High Speed Train to Paris", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/22/3-American-Heroes-Stop-Terrorist-High-Speed-Train-Paris", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTX1P67M.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/22/3-American-Heroes-Stop-Terrorist-High-Speed-Train-Paris", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTX1P67M.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "PARIS \u2014 Three Americans who foiled a suspected terrorist attack on a packed high-speed", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The incident is sure to raise fresh questions about European train security.\nFrench authorities have been on heightened alert for terrorism since the January attacks on the Charlie Hebdo newsweekly and a Paris kosher supermarket left 20 dead, including the three attackers.\nHollande\u2019s office said that the French president spoke Saturday with the Americans to thank them for their efforts to foil the attack.\nThe Eurostar train that runs through the channel tunnel between Paris and London has stronger security measures.\nPARIS \u2014 Three Americans who foiled a suspected terrorist attack on a packed high-speed train running from Amsterdam to Paris were being lauded as heroes Saturday, as officials continued their investigation and called for tighter security."}
