City and County of San Francisco, would have prevented local governments from restricting the Second Amendment.\n\nThe Supreme Court previously had taken up two landmark decisions\u2014D.C. v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago\u2014in which the court overturned attempts by local governments to pass strict gun laws.\n\nIn the San Francisco case, Justice Antonin Scalia joined Justice Clarence Thomas in dissent, arguing the Supreme Court should have reviewed the case based on the two previous rulings.\n\nJohn Malcolm, director of The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, called the Supreme Court\u2019s refusal \u201cunfortunate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt leaves gun owners seeking to protect themselves and their families inside their own homes\u2014a right recognized by the Supreme Court in Heller and McDonald\u2014less able to defend themselves should armed intruders break into their home in the middle of the night,\u201d he said.\n\nThomas opened his dissent citing the McDonald case, which said \u201cself-defense is a basic right\u201d and \u201cthe central component\u201d of the Second Amendment.\n\n\u201cLess than a decade ago, we explained that an ordinance requiring firearms in the home to be kept inoperable, without an exception for self-defense, conflicted with the Second Amendment because it \u201cma[de] it impossible for citizens to use [their firearms] for the core lawful purpose of self-defense,\u201d Thomas continued, citing Heller.\n\nThomas called San Francisco\u2019s law a \u201csignificant\u201d burden, detailing the story of one of the petitioner\u2019s, an older woman who lives alone and must \u201cturn on the light, find [her] glasses, find the key to the lockbox, insert the key in the lock and unlock the box \u2026 and then get [her] gun before being in position to defend [herself].\u201d\n\nMalcolm believes the Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to review the case is a missed opportunity.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope that the Supreme Court finds another occasion to bring some much needed clarity to the scope of this long-ignored and much-derided liberty interest that is a birthright of all law-abiding Americans as set forth in the Bill of Rights,\u201d Malcolm said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Supreme Court has refused to hear a major case regarding gun rights, leaving a strict San Francisco gun law in tact.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Supreme Court has refused to hear a major case regarding gun rights, leaving a strict San Francisco gun law in tact.", "title": "Supreme Court Refuses to Stop Law That Restricts Gun Rights", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150610_SCOTUSGuns_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-10T14:35:09+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1BYPMRi"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Supreme Court has refused to hear a major case regarding gun rights, leaving a strict San Francisco gun law in tact.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150610_SCOTUSGuns_Johnson.jpg"}, "title": "Supreme Court Refuses to Stop Law That Restricts Gun Rights", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "firearms", "published_time": "2015-06-10T11:26:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-10T14:35:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Jackson v.
