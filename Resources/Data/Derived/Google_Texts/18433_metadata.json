Obamacare removes the onerous qualification interviews and byzantine enrollment hoops that have traditionally plagued would-be enrollees.\n\nNot in Ohio, though. Here, the enrollment process is being complicated by bureaucratic mismanagement and the governor\u2019s inability to lead his own party.\n\nThere are 5 ways to enroll in Medicaid in Ohio (federal website, federal phone, state website, state phone, and county Job and Family Services) and, depending on the route you take, you\u2019ll get 5 completely different instructions. If you\u2019re told by one source to go to another, well, God help you\u2014it\u2019s probably impossible for you to enroll right now.\n\nThe problem is that the state (the ultimate authority) is refusing to accept any data from the federal government; the state website isn\u2019t entirely accurate; and county JFS isn\u2019t being updated on the enrollment requirements in a timely manner. So you\u2019ll hear from the feds that you\u2019re enrolled, but you won\u2019t be; you\u2019ll be told by the state that you need to send paperwork to the county; and you\u2019ll be told by the county that you need all of the paperwork required for food stamps and housing assistance.\n\n(For the record, I understand that the best way to get coverage is to call the Ohio Consumer Medicaid Hotline at 800-324-8680 and explain that you\u2019re only interested in enrolling in Medicaid.)\n\nTo understand why this is happening\u2014and why it\u2019s the governor\u2019s fault\u2014there are a few things that need to be made clear.\n\n1. Medicaid enrollment requires less documentation than any other means-tested program. Since it saves taxpayer money to enroll somebody in Medicaid rather than the exchange, Medicaid enrollment requires only proof of income. Since the insurance exchanges interact with IRS records, most people don\u2019t even need to supply that.\n\nOther programs (SNAP, TANF, housing vouchers, etc) have lengthy questionnaires, requiring a wide range of documents. Traditionally, Ohio Benefit Bank has handled enrollment in all of these programs and required people to bring all of the documents\u2014even those for programs for which they aren\u2019t interested in applying.\n\nTherefore, encouraging Medicaid applicants to apply for other means-tested programs is a significant barrier to entry.\n\n2. Medicaid is entirely a state-administered program. While the Affordable Care Act establishes new Medicaid guidelines and funds the entirety of Medicaid expansion at the federal level, it allows states to keep administrative control of the program.\n\nIn Ohio, Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor (who is also the Director of our health care exchange) specifically barred HHS from performing Medicaid enrollments in Ohio. Instead, Ohio will continue to perform all Medicaid enrollments\u2014including those that are received through www.healthcare.gov.\n\nThe result is that Ohio is maintaining full regulatory authority, the same way that it maintains exclusive power to select plans on the exchange. It\u2019s technically a Federally-Facilitated Exchange, but the Lt. Gov. has more authority over it than does HHS.\n\n3. Ohio is rejecting a federal offer to cover the people who enroll in Medicaid at healthcare.gov. One of the last remaining technical snafus of Obamacare enrollment is matching the federal Medicaid database with state Medicaid databases. While the blame for this falls largely on federal administrators, it bears mentioning that Ohio\u2019s Medicaid database is 1 month old. The previous database, CRIS-E, was from 1978.\n\nSince the data migration will likely take months, the federal government has offered to pay the states for everybody who enrolled in Medicaid through www.healthcare.gov (even if those new enrollees were already qualified under pre-Obamacare guidelines). This is basically free money for the states\u2014by and large, it\u2019s the federal government picking up the full freight of new CHIP enrollees.\n\nThis process creates some headaches for bureaucrats, sure. But bureaucrats can treat those headaches\u2014they have health coverage!\n\n4. County departments of Job and Family Services aren\u2019t being directed by the Ohio Department of Medicaid. Until very recently, Medicaid was housed under ODJFS, and Medicaid enrollment was handled primarily by county JFS. With Medicaid expansion, this arrangement no longer made sense.\n\nNow Medicaid is its own department, administratively separate from ODJFS. However, there are no county Medicaid offices so Ohioans are being told to go in person to county JFS offices. Once there, it seems that JFS personnel are directed to enroll them in Ohio Benefit Bank and deny them Medicaid coverage until they do so.\n\nThis is hugely problematic because they aren\u2019t being told to bring the documentation for JFS-administered programs! For people who aren\u2019t looking for housing or food assistance, this means they have to take 2 days off to make 2 completely unnecessary trips.\n\nThe obvious workaround is to have county JFS employees stop forcing people into Ohio Benefit Bank. With the change in oversight, however, it\u2019s unclear who in the Kasich administration will step up and fix the problem.\n\n5. Most of this is happening because Kasich waited too long to expand Medicaid. These problems are all a matter of administrative miscommunication, and will sort themselves out in a few months. Had the Controlling Board decision to take the Medicaid expansion funding come a few months earlier, then the problems would already be resolved.\n\nAlternatively, had Kasich been able to lead his own party\u2019s legislators, they could have taken the Medicaid issue off the table entirely.\n\n6. Ohio\u2019s newspapers don\u2019t seem to care that Medicaid enrollment isn\u2019t working. Reporters are outraged with problems at healthcare.gov but are more than happy to send people to benefits.ohio.gov\u2026 which has the same problems. They\u2019re also seemingly unwilling to call anybody from HHS, but more than happy to report partisan statements from the Kasich administration.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much that the federal government can do to fix Ohio\u2019s Medicaid enrollment problems. As long as the media allows the Kasich administration to blame the federal government for its own administrative failings, it will remain way too difficult for Ohioans to enroll in Medicaid.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Plunderbund", "description": "The best aspect of Obamacare is that it expands Medicaid into a convenient, comprehensive single-payer insurance system.
