Anthony List announced Thursday.\n\nDetails about the new ad campaign are vague, but the group says it will target three southern Democrats \u2013 Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana \u2013 for allegedly voting in favor of taxpayer-funded abortion as part of President Barack Obama's 2010 health care reform law.\n\nThe three senators are up for re-election in November.\n\n\n\nSusan B. Anthony List\n\nSusan B. Anthony List\n\nSusan B. Anthony List\n\nA nearly identical ad against then-Rep. Steve Driehaus, D-Ohio, propelled the case known as Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus onto the Supreme Court docket. Billboard companies refused to run the ad in 2010 when Driehaus threatened to sue. A panel of the Ohio Elections Commission found probable cause that the ad violated two sections of Ohio law that criminalize making or disseminating false claims during a political campaign and the issue was referred to the full commission. No decision was made before the election.\n\nThe Susan B. Anthony List and an allied group sued in federal district court, saying their First Amendment free speech and association rights were threatened. They were rebuffed by the court and a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed that decision, in part because the commission did not issue a final ruling and also, the court said, because \u201cevidence is thin at best\u201d that Driehaus would seek office again.\n\nThe health care law bans federal funding for abortion by requiring subsidized insurance policies to use nonpublic funds for the procedure. Lawyers for the Susan B. Anthony List said in an August filing with the Supreme Court the group believes that\u2019s \u201ca mere accounting gimmick,\u201d making their claim truthful.\n\nThe attorneys say Ohio's speech restriction is unconstitutional and may chill the practice of First Amendment rights. They hope for a ruling similar to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2012 decision in United States v. Alvarez, in which justices struck down a federal law that criminalized false statements about having a military medal.\n\n\u201cAs all of the justices correctly recognized, allowing the government to serve as arbiter of political truth cannot be squared with basic free speech principles. Yet nearly one-third of the states still have statutes prohibiting 'false' statements made during political campaigns \u2013 often, as in Ohio, with criminal sanctions attached,\u201d the lawyers argued. \u201cThese laws do exactly what Alvarez warned against, inserting state bureaucrats and judges into political debates and charging them with separating truth from oft-alleged campaign 'lies.'\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the new billboard plans will be derailed because of state restrictions.\n\nNorth Carolina has a law similar to Ohio's that makes it a misdemeanor punishable with a $1,000 fine and up to 30 days in jail \u201c[f]or any person to publish or cause to be circulated derogatory reports with reference to any candidate in any primary or election, knowing such report to be false or in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity, when such report is calculated or intended to affect the chances of such candidate for nomination or election.\u201d\n\nThe anti-abortion activists claim to be unfazed by possible penalties.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "freedom of speech", "title": "First Amendment Obamacare Ad Fight Looms as More Allegedly False Billboards Go Up", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The Supreme Court will consider later this month if a group can say the health law funds abortion.", "title": "First Amendment Obamacare Ad Fight Looms as More Allegedly False Billboards Go Up", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/04/10/first-amendment-obamacare-ad-fight-looms-as-more-allegedly-false-billboards-go-up", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/4f/66/cdca4958432486ae129bfedfc087/140410-abortion-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "The Supreme Court will consider later this month if a group can say the health law funds abortion.<br>", "card": "summary", "title": "First Amendment Obamacare Ad Fight Looms as More Allegedly False Billboards Go Up"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "April 10, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Steven Nelson,2016 presidential election,Steven Nelson,Pulse,picks,Affordable Care Act,Landrieu, Mary,Pryor, Mark,Hagan, Kay,Collections: Political,Collections: US,Supreme Court,freedom of speech", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Supreme Court will consider later this month if a group can say the health law funds abortion."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb5de\"", "article_summary": "Susan B.
