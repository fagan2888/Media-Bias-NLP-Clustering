Mother. Ever,\u201d said Amy Anderson, whose daughter Aubrey Anderson-Emmons plays the scene-stealing Lily on \u201cModern Family\u201d and thumb-wrestled the musical\u2019s star, Alan Cumming, after the show.\n\nThe self-insult doesn\u2019t quite fit.\n\nOn stage, the two seemed perfectly in sync last weekend as they rehearsed \u201cTogether Wherever We Go\u201d for an Illusion Theater fundraiser in downtown Minneapolis \u2014 an ironic choice considering the song, from the musical \u201cGypsy,\u201d is a duet between an obsessed stage mother and her put-upon child.\n\nBut Anderson seems committed to making sure her child doesn\u2019t get too star-struck.\n\n\u201cEvery night, I sit next to her bed and whisper, \u2018You\u2019re not that special\u2019 \u2014 just to balance things out,\u201d Anderson joked as her daughter played with her right ear, hair, chin and sweater straps during a joint interview in the theater\u2019s green room.\n\nFormer Minnesotan Amy Anderson and daughter Aubrey Anderson-Emmons, who plays Lily on \u201cModern Family.\u201d\n\nAnderson, who grew up in the Twin Cities before moving to Los Angeles in 2001, cites the Illusion as a major influence on her career as a stand-up comedian and actress.\n\nHer daughter had very little experience before auditioning for the role of Mitchell and Cameron\u2019s adopted daughter on the ABC sitcom, which has won the Emmy for best comedy five years in a row.\n\n\u201c \u2018You\u2019re not going to get it,\u2019 I told her over and over,\u201d Anderson said. \u201c \u2018They\u2019re going to see lots of little girls, and they are only going to pick one.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSpending an afternoon with Anderson-Emmons, who took over the part three years ago, you can see why she stood out. In addition to her skills on stage, she\u2019s animated, personable and refreshingly honest in person.\n\nWhen asked if she ever watches \u201cModern Family\u201d at home, she nods vigorously.\n\n\u201cI always fast-forward to my part,\u201d she said from the couch as her feet danced in the air.\n\nShe has every reason to be proud. Her role as a mini-diva has created some of the show\u2019s biggest laughs, as she continually deflates the egos of her uptight parents.\n\nHer crowning moment: a special film created for the 2012 Emmys in which she plays an off-screen monster, removing stairs from co-stars\u2019 trailers, a prank she was more than willing to re-create during the interview.\n\nHer real-life mother said she was initially wary of allowing her child to be in the public eye, but eventually got over her fear. She cites the success of upcoming Oscar host Neil Patrick Harris, who first got noticed as TV teen doctor Doogie Howser, and \u201cWonder Years\u201d star Fred Savage, who has directed five episodes of \u201cModern Family.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the kids on TV who turn out with problems are more the exception than the rule,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there are as many messed-up kids who are going to high school and playing football, but nobody wants to read about them because they don\u2019t know who they are.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Anderson-Emmons seems to relish the spotlight while also preserving some private time for herself. She proudly announces that she had the biggest role in her community theater\u2019s production of \u201cSeussical Jr.\u201d but says she isn\u2019t a big fan of posing for pictures with strangers.\n\nAs for her future plans, she\u2019s not sure if she wants to be an actress \u2014 although she covets the role of \u201cCabaret\u2019s\u201d Sally Bowles.\n\nDon\u2019t bet against her.\n\nMother and daughter rehearsed \u201cTogether Wherever We Go\u201d for a fundraiser last weekend at Illusion Theater in Minneapolis.\n\nSEE A VIDEO\n\nof Aubrey Anderson-Emmons and her mom rehearsing their duet at startribune.com/tv.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Life is a cabaret for young \"Modern Family\" star Aubrey Anderson-Emmons, who visited the Twin Cities last weekend for a fundraiser.", "title": "Life with Lily: A backstage visit with 'Modern Family' scene-stealer", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/life-with-lily-a-backstage-visit-with-modern-family-scene-stealer/280231672/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141409730638389.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141409730638389.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Life is a cabaret for young \"Modern Family\" star Aubrey Anderson-Emmons, who visited the Twin Cities last weekend for a fundraiser.", "title": "Life with Lily: A backstage visit with 'Modern Family' scene-stealer", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/life-with-lily-a-backstage-visit-with-modern-family-scene-stealer/280231672/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141409730638389.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_141409730638389.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Life is a cabaret for young \"Modern Family\" star Aubrey Anderson-Emmons, who visited the Twin Cities last weekend for a fundraiser."}, "article_summary": "Ever,\u201d said Amy Anderson, whose daughter Aubrey Anderson-Emmons plays the scene-stealing Lily on \u201cModern Family\u201d and thumb-wrestled the musical\u2019s star, Alan Cumming, after the show.\nSEE A VIDEOof Aubrey Anderson-Emmons and her mom rehearsing their duet at startribune.com/tv.\nMother and daughter rehearsed \u201cTogether Wherever We Go\u201d for a fundraiser last weekend at Illusion Theater in Minneapolis.\nWhen asked if she ever watches \u201cModern Family\u201d at home, she nods vigorously.\nVideo (01:00) : Former Minnesotan Amy Anderson and her 7-year-old daughter Aubrey Anderson-Emmons, who plays \"Lily\" on the television show \"Modern Family,\" rehearse the song \"Together, Wherever We Go\" by Bette Midler for a fundraiser at Illusion Theater in Minneapolis on Saturday, October 18, 2014."}
