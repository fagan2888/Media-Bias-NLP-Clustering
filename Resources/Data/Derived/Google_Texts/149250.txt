Dallas Area Rapid Transit officials say a woman was killed Saturday afternoon by an eastbound Trinity Railway Express train near downtown Irving.

TRE operations were halted for more than an hour and a half after the incident, which DART spokesman Morgan Lyons says occurred around 4 p.m. at the Nursery Road Trinity Railway Express crossing, located just east of the Downtown Irving/Heritage Crossing Station.

At the moment, Lyons says, it appears to have been an accident. But the Dallas County Medical Examiner and Irving police will make the final determination.

“We have crossing arms in that area, and all the initial reports are all the signals and crossing arms were working properly,” says Lyons.

There were 260 people aboard the train, and Lyons says there were no injuries to passengers. But, of course, incidents like this one are “very difficult for the operators as well as the people on board once they become aware of what happens.” Officials said just before 6 p.m. that they would be transferred to another train while the investigation continues.

A westbound TRE train from Union Station was also delayed, but DART officials said they were able to resume limited service about 6:30 p.m.
