Now we have evidence that it has spread to the top organ of the judiciary, the Supreme Court.\n\nBut first, a clarification. Sufferers of faith-derangement syndrome (FDS) exhibit the following symptoms: unshakable belief in the veracity of manifest absurdities detailed in ancient texts regarding the origins of the cosmos and life on earth; a determination to disseminate said absurdities in educational institutions and via the media; a propensity to enjoin and even enforce (at times using violence) obedience to regulations stipulated in said ancient texts, regardless of their suitability for contemporary circumstances; the conviction that an invisible, omnipresent, omniscient authority (commonly referred to as \u201cGod\u201d) directs the course of human and natural events, is vulnerable to propitiation and blandishments, and monitors individual human behavior, including thought processes, with an especially prurient interest in sexual activity.\n\nSecondary symptoms exhibited by sufferers of FDS comprise feelings of righteousness and sensations of displeasure, even outrage, when collocutors question, reject or refute the espousal of said absurdities. Tertiary symptoms, often present among individuals self-classifying as \u201cevangelicals\u201d: Duggar-esque hairdos and Tammy Bakker-ian makeup, preternaturally sunny dispositions and pedophiliac tendencies, sartorial ineptitude and obesity.\n\nBack to FDS and the Supreme Court. Last week, Justice Antonin Scalia delivered a commencement speech at an all-girls Catholic High School in Bethesda, Maryland. He warned the assembled, \u201cYou should not leave Stone Ridge High School thinking that you face challenges that are at all, in any important sense, unprecedented. Humanity has been around for at least some 5,000 years or so\u201d \u2013 sic, italics mine \u2013 \u201cand I doubt that the basic challenges as confronted are any worse now, or alas even much different, from what they ever were.\u201d\n\nAt least one \u201cchallenge\u201d (anthropogenic global warming) is indeed unprecedented, and scientifically demonstrated, and, considering the threat it poses to humanity, not something to ho-hum about. But what is science to a man suffering from faith-derangement syndrome? Not much.\n\nArguably one of the most visible members of the nine-member body charged with the decisive resolution of our republic\u2019s most contentious legal matters, Scalia confronts us with a sui generis challenge of great urgency: how to go about declaring a magistrate appointed for life of unsound mind and thus unfit to serve? Scalia rejects the fact of evolution \u2013 the foundation of modern biology \u2013 in favor of the opening chapter of a compendium of cockamamie fables concocted by obscure humans in a particularly dark age, evidence that his faculty of reason has suffered the debilitating impairment associated with acute FDS. He therefore cannot be relied upon to adjudicate without prejudice and should be removed from the bench henceforth.\n\nWe have even more damning evidence of Justice Scalia\u2019s FDS-related impairment, and it came to my attention thanks to the website of the New Civil Rights Movement. A couple of years ago, Scalia nonplussed a contributing editor at New York magazine, Jennifer Senior, who made the understandable mistake of assuming that the Harvard-educated SCOTUS potentate lived in the real world, and not in a phantasmagorical realm of djinns and genies and junk cosmogony.\n\nSenior interviewed Scalia for her magazine. She asked for his opinion of the pope. Scalia reacted with untoward prickliness, saying he would not \u201crun down \u2026 the Vicar of Christ.\u201d Nothing surprising, really. A Reagan-era appointee, Scalia has long been known for his staunch Roman Catholicism.\n\nBut then the interview took a comic, almost sinister turn. Senior asked Scalia about homosexuality. Though professing to be \u201cnot a hater of homosexuals at all,\u201d he said that he accepted \u201cCatholic teaching that it\u2019s wrong.\u201d She pressed him to evaluate how such a position will look to people 50 years from now. He responded, \u201cI have never been custodian of my legacy. When I\u2019m dead and gone, I\u2019ll either be sublimely happy or terribly unhappy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou believe in heaven and hell?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, of course I do. Don\u2019t you believe in heaven and hell?\u201d\n\nNo, Senior answered, she did not. Scalia then proffered an entirely serious aside about Judas Iscariot\u2019s current location in the hereafter, prompting an uncomfortable Senior to remark, \u201cCan we talk about your drafting process?\u201d\n\nNo. Here Scalia\u2019s FDS recrudesced in full. He leaned toward her and whispered, surely with eyes ablaze, \u201cI even believe in the Devil \u2026 he\u2019s a real person. Hey, c\u2019mon, that\u2019s standard Catholic doctrine! Every Catholic believes that.\u201d\n\nBy this time, Senior must have been scanning the room for the emergency exit. But she pulled herself together. \u201cHave you seen evidence of the Devil lately?\u201d\n\nScalia replied, \u201cYou know, it is curious. In the Gospels, the Devil is doing all sorts of things. He\u2019s making pigs run off cliffs, he\u2019s possessing people and whatnot. And that doesn\u2019t happen very much anymore \u2026 because he\u2019s smart.\u201d Scalia attributed the spread of atheism to Satan, who was \u201cgetting people not to believe in him or in God. He\u2019s much more successful that way.\u201d Satan had, in Scalia\u2019s estimation, become \u201cwilier,\u201d which explained \u201cwhy there\u2019s not demonic possession all over the place.\u201d\n\nOne can only imagine the look of bug-eyed incredulity on poor Senior\u2019s face. Scalia certainly noticed it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at me as though I\u2019m weird,\u201d he declared. \u201cMy God! Are you so out of touch with most of America, most of which believes in the Devil? I mean, Jesus Christ believed in the Devil! It\u2019s in the Gospels! You travel in circles that are so, so removed from mainstream America that you are appalled that anybody would believe in the Devil! Most of mankind has believed in the Devil, for all of history. Many more intelligent people than you or me have believed in the Devil.\u201d\n\nClearly a traveler in circles of folks far saner than six out of 10 Americans, Senior nevertheless observed the societal convention according to which we are to keep calm, nod and act normal when victims of FDS solemnly utter their characteristically rank inanities. She responded, \u201cI hope you weren\u2019t sensing contempt from me. It wasn\u2019t your belief that surprised me so much as how boldly you expressed it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The justice claims to be an originalist, but his real loyalty is to religion and a phony man in the sky", "title": "Antonin Scalia is unfit to serve: A justice who rejects science and the law for religion is of unsound mind", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The justice claims to be an originalist, but his real loyalty is to religion and a phony man in the sky", "title": "Antonin Scalia is unfit to serve: A justice who rejects science and the law for religion is of unsound mind", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/14/antonin_scalia_is_unfit_to_serve_a_justice_who_rejects_science_and_the_law_for_religion_is_of_unsound_mind/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/antonin_scalia6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The justice claims to be an originalist, but his real loyalty is to religion and a phony man in the sky", "title": "Antonin Scalia is unfit to serve: A justice who rejects science and the law for religion is of unsound mind", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/antonin_scalia6.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jeffrey Tayler", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Antonin Scalia, Evolution, Religion, Supreme Court", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd22eb\"", "article_summary": "He leaned toward her and whispered, surely with eyes ablaze, \u201cI even believe in the Devil \u2026 he\u2019s a real person.\nLast week, Justice Antonin Scalia delivered a commencement speech at an all-girls Catholic High School in Bethesda, Maryland.\nYou travel in circles that are so, so removed from mainstream America that you are appalled that anybody would believe in the Devil!\nScalia reacted with untoward prickliness, saying he would not \u201crun down \u2026 the Vicar of Christ.\u201d Nothing surprising, really.\nNow we have evidence that it has spread to the top organ of the judiciary, the Supreme Court."}
