Unfortunately, his vacation keeps getting interrupted by phone calls from people trying to enroll him in Covered California (California\u2019s Obamacare health insurance exchange).\n\nFairley doesn\u2019t want to enroll in Obamacare. He has insurance through his employer, Accenture. He has had this coverage for the past five years. He says he has never expressed any interest in enrolling in one of Covered California\u2019s plans.\n\n@CoveredCA I have been insured the entire time. STOP the CALLS!!! #fb \u2014 Leon Fairley (@LeonF63) April 7, 2015\n\nA reasonable request, one would think.\n\n@CoveredCA you are posing me of. 12 agencies representing have called me now. This is harassment. I'm insured through my employer. \u2014 Leon Fairley (@LeonF63) April 7, 2015\n\n@CoveredCA I have never indicated interested in coverage through program.
