Rick Perry said Wednesday that the state should provide health coverage to low-income Texans under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a move the Republican-led Legislature has opposed.\n\nThe 15-member Texas Institute of Health Care Quality and Efficiency recommended that the state\u2019s health commissioner be authorized to negotiate a Texas-specific agreement with the federal government to expand health coverage to the poor, \u201cusing available federal funds.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to look at actions whereby more Texans can be covered,\u201d said board chairman Steve Berkowitz, the president and founder 0f SMB Health Consulting. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to take the politics out of it.\u201d\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, President Obama\u2019s signature health law, the federal government has offered to foot more than 90 percent of the bill for states that expand their Medicaid programs to cover adults living in poverty. Perry and other Republican leaders have criticized the program, which could insure more than 1 million currently uncovered Texans, as inefficient.\n\nLawmakers considered an alternative \u201cTexas solution\u201d to Medicaid expansion during the 2013 legislative session \u2014 an initiative that would have called on the state's health agency to seek a waiver from the federal government to draw down funds to cover the uninsured. That proposal failed. Ultimately the GOP-led Legislature approved a requirement that the Health and Human Services Commission receive legislative approval before expanding Medicaid eligibility \u2014 an effort to ensure that they held the keys to any possible agreement with the feds.\n\nMembers of the Institute of Health Care Quality and Efficiency \u2014 which was established by lawmakers in the 2011 legislative session to identify evidence-based approaches to improving health care and cutting costs \u2014 said Wednesday that Texas\u2019 rate of uninsured was \u201cunacceptable,\u201d and that state leaders should look for an alternative way to expand health coverage. The board's recommendations are not binding and any such decision is up to the Legislature.\n\n\u201cWe should be maximizing available federal funds through the Medicaid program to improve health care for all Texans,\u201d said Joel Allison, a board member who is chief executive of the Baylor Scott & White Health System.\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
