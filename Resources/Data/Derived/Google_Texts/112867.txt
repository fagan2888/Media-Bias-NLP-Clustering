BOULDER — It has often been said the only thing worse than being left out of the NCAA Tournament is drawing a No. 8 or No. 9 seed. That’s because the winner of the 8-vs.-9 matchup faces a No. 1 seed.

Good thing Colorado’s players don’t feel that way.

The Buffaloes (23-11) are seeded eighth in the South Regional and will open tournament play Thursday at the Amway Center in Orlando, Fla., against No. 9 seed Pittsburgh (25-9), with the winner all but certain to face top-seeded Florida on Saturday.

The NCAA Tournament selection committee granted Florida (32-2) the overall No. 1 seed among the 68-team field.

“If you think you’re the best, you have to play the best,” Colorado junior guard Askia Booker said. “To be honest, when I saw ‘Florida’ pop up, I wanted us to pop up on there too.”

Buffs players watched the “Selection Sunday” telecast at the home of CU coach Tad Boyle, and everyone erupted into cheers when “Colorado” flashed on the screen.

They did not have to wait long. Colorado vs. Pittsburgh was the second matchup announced, following Florida vs. the winner of Tuesday’s “First four” game in Dayton, Ohio, between Albany and Mount St. Mary’s that will determine the 16-seed in the South Regional.

“When your name is called in the first 60 seconds, it’s amazing,” Booker said. “It was like a weight was lifted off our shoulders. Now it’s time to get down to business.”

This is the first time Colorado has qualified three consecutive years for the NCAA Tournament in men’s basketball.

“That’s one of the reasons I came here, to go to the NCAA Tournament,” CU freshman forward Dustin Thomas said. “That’s a credit to Coach (Tad) Boyle.”

The No. 8 seed was higher than the projections of ESPN and USA Today. Both had pegged Colorado for a No. 10 seed.

Boyle said he figured the Buffs’ seeding would fall in the 8-10 range.

“We’re not at the point where we can go begging for a high seed — not yet, anyway,” Boyle said. “But one day I hope this program can become that. Orlando is a good place to go this time of year.”

Boyle said he had not seen much of Pittsburgh on television.

“But I know they have a heck of a coach in Jamie Dixon,” Boyle said.

In their first season in the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Panthers were seeded fifth in league tournament and eliminated North Carolina 80-75 in the quarterfinals before losing to top-seeded Virginia 51-48 in Saturday’s semifinals.

Pittsburgh is led by a pair of seniors: 6-foot-5 guard Lamar Patterson (17.6 points per game) and 6-9, 230-pound forward Talib Zanna (12.9 points, 8.8 rebounds). Zanna was named to the all-ACC Tournament team.

“I know Pittsburgh is usually a physical team,” said Wesley Gordon, CU’s redshirt freshman forward. “We’ve been playing physical teams in the Pac-12, so I think that’s gotten us ready to play a team like Pittsburgh.”

Dixon said he needs to do a lot of research on Colorado.

“I don’t know a lot about (CU), but I know they change defenses a bit,” Dixon told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. “They are skilled, they pass the ball real well and they seem to have a real good balance as a team. And Tad Boyle has done a really good job.”
