At least Democrats finally have some vague sense that they can\u2019t just keep racking up trillions in debt to finance their vote-buying schemes. That\u2019s progress, sort of.\n\nSo we\u2019re back to tax-and-spend liberalism, instead of Obama\u2019s tax-and-send-the-bill-to-your-kids version of deficit-fueled lunacy. It\u2019s still not an honest game, and not just because getting Democrats to use the words \u201ctax increase\u201d requires effort akin to performing an exorcism.\n\nThey love to pretend only super-rich people will be forced to pay for everything, no matter how often people who understand math point out that a relatively small group of wealthy individuals don\u2019t have the cash to finance plans on the scale Democrats envision, not even if their money is confiscated outright. All the class-warfare demagoguery in the world won\u2019t change the fact that taxation is a hideously inefficient means of diverting resources, and spending commitments won\u2019t go away, even when the tax hikes inevitably fail to generate the promised revenue.\n\nHave you ever noticed how tax hikes never produce anything close to the promised revenue? That\u2019s because rich and clever people, very much including Hillary Rodham Clinton and her family, always find ways to avoid paying the taxes. Many of their methods are impractical for lower-income brackets, so the burden of paying for Big Government spending always rolls downhill, in a process familiar to every homeowner in the Rockies.\n\nOf course, liberals are monstrous hypocrites when it comes to tax avoidance. They love to describe it as a crime, deliberately confusing it with illegal tax evasion schemes, when other people do it. Clinton is brimming with ideas for punishing companies that use \u201ctricks\u201d to avoid high taxes.\n\nShe sneered that those who use maneuvers like corporate inversion to \u201cgame the system and leave everybody else holding the bag are just offensive to me\u201d in a typical rant this week, throwing in questions about their \u201cpatriotism\u201d for good measure. (But don\u2019t you dare ever question the patriotism of any Democrat, or any of their constituents, no matter what country they\u2019re actually citizens of!)\n\n\u201cYou should pay what you owe, just like everybody else,\u201d Clinton demanded.\n\nCorporate inversions are an easy target, because they involve companies shifting financial assets out of the country to avoid high U.S. tax rates. Bloomberg News quotes Donald Trump calling inversion \u201cdisgusting\u201d and shameful in the same article that related Clinton\u2019s remarks. (One month ago, on the other hand, Trump was saying the very same inverting company, Pfizer, should not be blamed for undertaking a move out of the country because the American corporate tax system is so bad, and he intends to fix it.)\n\nThere are many other ways to avoid high taxes besides inversion, and most of them involve a net loss to America\u2019s overall wealth, because the money would be used more productively, if investors and business managers weren\u2019t protecting it from ravenous Big Government. Also, the cost of devising and implementing avoidance strategies is immense, effectively siphoning billions away from investment and commerce, into accounting pursuits that have zero productive value.\n\nThis is, again, a hugely inefficient way of allocating national wealth. Sure, the accountant who helps a company save $100 million on taxes is probably going to buy himself a few nice things with his commission, but from an overall national standpoint, there is nothing worse than an industry dedicated to keeping the government from looting the private sector.\n\nOne of the biggest shell games politicians play is advocating high nominal tax rates, but providing their cronies with exemptions that make their actual tax rate far lower. Voters drunk on class-warfare rhetoric celebrate their conquering socialist heroes for really socking it to those rich fat cats with soaring tax rates\u2026 which most of the fat cats don\u2019t actually pay, especially when they\u2019re generous donors to the socialists.\n\nHillary Clinton herself is a champion at shielding her income from taxation. She\u2019s curiously reluctant to pay those \u201cpatriotic\u201d high taxes she demands for others. For example, she loves to demand high estate taxes, but she uses classic One Percenter financial tactics to create trusts and avoid those very same taxes.\n\nThere is nothing illegal about these tactics \u2013 any good financial planner would recommend them for the \u201cdead broke\u201d Clintons, whose net worth is well over $50 million \u2013 but the Clintons don\u2019t have to use them. They could take a patriotic stand, send their accountants packing, and piously insist on paying the huge tax bill they demand for others. Instead, as the New York Post put it, Bill and Hillary \u201chave apparently grown quite attached to their money.\u201d\n\nThis is an especially glaring hypocrisy in light of the media\u2019s bizarre effort to slam one of Clinton\u2019s 2016 rivals, Senator Marco Rubio, for having ObamaCare insurance even though he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act. There is nothing even slightly hypocritical about obeying a law \u2013 enforced vigorously by the IRS \u2013 that one ultimately hopes to change. Rubio\u2019s access to ObamaCare amounts to a very, very tiny fraction of the wealthy Hillary Clinton shields from the collectivist State she insists everyone else must feed with enthusiasm.\n\nFurthermore, Rubio and other ObamaCare opponents are working within the legislative system to change a law. Clinton and other tax hypocrites are trying to shame people who obey the law, accusing them of unwritten meta-crimes for refusing to voluntarily pay more taxes than they are legally required to. They\u2019re trying to work up political support by painting law-abiding individuals and companies as enemies of The People.\n\nWhen that\u2019s your game, voluntarily refusing to take advantage of the \u201cloopholes\u201d you rail against is a necessary act of moral leadership. Taxation shouldn\u2019t be a moral crusade anyway, because treating such an important topic emotionally sets the public up for all kinds of sucker plays. The Tax Foundation cites the Clinton example to argue that estate taxes \u201cfail to collect significant revenue and mainly serve to support a cottage industry of tax planning \u2013 resources that could better be used in the productive economy.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Democrat voters would be unlikely to accept getting rid of such taxes, because that would be a totally unacceptable sop to the Evil Rich\u2026 even as they vote for a very rich candidate who goes to great lengths to avoid paying those taxes. They won\u2019t support tax cuts that would create jobs and increase income for the middle class, if they think the rich will benefit as well. They\u2019ll never support tax reforms that would radically simplify the system and make everyone\u2019s taxes fit on a postcard, even though no tax form longer than a postcard will ever be devoid of nooks and crannies that only Big Money can exploit.\n\nThese Democratic voters never demand the financial clarity from government that they demand from even the smallest private operation. That\u2019s a knockout victory for emotion over reason.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary's Tax Hypocrisy: Don't Count On Her Favorite 'Loopholes' Getting Closed", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Hillary's Tax Hypocrisy: Don't Count On Her Favorite 'Loopholes' Getting Closed", "title": "Hillary's Tax Hypocrisy: Don't Count On Her Favorite 'Loopholes' Getting Closed", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/AP_995102790637.jpg", "height": 640}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/11/hillarys-tax-hypocrisy-dont-count-favorite-loopholes-getting-closed/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary's Tax Hypocrisy: Don't Count On Her Favorite 'Loopholes' Getting Closed", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/AP_995102790637.jpg", "title": "Hillary's Tax Hypocrisy: Don't Count On Her Favorite 'Loopholes' Getting Closed", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 campaign, corporate inversions, Donald Trump, exemptions, Hillary Clinton, Marco Rubio, tax avoidance, tax evasion, taxes,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Hillary", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "taxes", "published_time": "2015-12-11T13:50:46-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd447e\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIt\u2019s remarkable how much effort left-wingers put into avoiding the high taxes they advocate for everyone else.\nClinton is brimming with ideas for punishing companies that use \u201ctricks\u201d to avoid high taxes.\nCorporate inversions are an easy target, because they involve companies shifting financial assets out of the country to avoid high U.S. tax rates.\nShe\u2019s curiously reluctant to pay those \u201cpatriotic\u201d high taxes she demands for others.\nThat\u2019s because rich and clever people, very much including Hillary Rodham Clinton and her family, always find ways to avoid paying the taxes."}
