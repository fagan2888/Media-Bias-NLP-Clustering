BOODMA, Kaiser Health News\n\nDoctors at a Northern California hospital, concerned that a 40-year-old woman with sky-high blood pressure and confusion might have a blood clot, order a CT scan of her lungs. To their surprise, the scan reveals not a clot but large cancers in both breasts that have spread throughout her body.\n\nHad they done a simple physical exam of the woman\u2019s chest, they would have been able to feel the tumors. So would the doctors who saw her during several hospitalizations over the previous two years, when the cancer might have been more easily treated.\n\nA middle-aged man admitted to a Seattle emergency room for the third time in six weeks displays the classic signs of liver cirrhosis for which he has been repeatedly treated, including swollen legs and a distended abdomen. But a veteran doctor spots a telltale indicator of a different disease: rapid inward pulsations just beneath the man\u2019s right ear. The patient\u2019s problem is not his liver but his heart: he has constrictive pericarditis, a serious condition that requires surgery.\n\nBoth cases reflect a phenomenon that some prominent medical educators say has become increasingly commonplace as medicine becomes more technology-driven: the waning ability of doctors to use a physical exam to make an accurate diagnosis. Information gleaned from inspecting blood vessels at the back of the eye, observing a patient\u2019s walk, feeling the liver or checking fingernails can provide valuable clues to underlying diseases or incipient problems, they say.\n\nBut over the past few decades the physical diagnosis skills that were once the cornerstone of doctoring have withered, supplanted by a dizzying array of sophisticated, expensive tests.\n\nThere is general agreement that the technological explosion that began in the 1980s led to the decline of bedside skills. Insurance that pays for tests but gives short shrift to a careful and time-consuming history and physical exam accelerated the trend, as has the growing paperwork burden doctors face. The generation of influential mentors who taught physical diagnosis has largely retired.\n\nEven bedside rounds \u2014 where such knowledge was often imparted to impressionable neophyte physicians \u2014 are mostly a thing of the past, migrating from a patient\u2019s hospital bed to a conference room down the hall where test results and the chart \u2014 not the actual patient \u2014 are examined.\n\n\u201cA lot of people downplay the physical exam and say it\u2019s fluff,\u201d said Salvatore Mangione, associate director of the internal medicine residency at Philadelphia\u2019s Jefferson Medical College.\n\nIn a 2012 article in the Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine, Mangione wrote that he has seen \u201cmany cases in which technology, unguided by bedside skills, took physicians down a path where tests begot tests and where, at the end, there was usually a surgeon, and often a lawyer. Sometimes even an undertaker.\u201d\n\nESSENTIAL SKILLS\n\nTo address the problem, programs to revive and teach physical diagnosis \u2014 also known as bedside medicine \u2014 are underway at some medical schools, including Stanford, Jefferson and Johns Hopkins.\n\nThe programs are predicated on a belief that these skills are an essential adjunct to technology and can boost diagnostic accuracy, curb unnecessary testing and foster a greater connection between patients and doctors, many of whom spend increasing amounts of their day staring at their computers rather than looking at the patients they are treating.\n\nAt Hopkins, a Web-based program called Murmurlab.org seeks to improve young doctors\u2019 ability to use a stethoscope \u2014 a tricky skill that studies show is lacking \u2014 to distinguish serious cardiac problems from more common benign heart murmurs.\n\nThe goal is to reduce unnecessary and costly echocardiograms.\n\nInternist and best-selling author Abraham Verghese was instrumental in creating the six-year-old Stanford Medicine 25 program: 25 physical exam skills that students are required to learn, demonstrate and teach. These include assessing enlarged lymph nodes, measuring ankle reflexes and performing a knee exam.\n\n\u201cWe can pick off the low-hanging fruit \u2014 the obvious diagnosis that one can miss at great cost to the patient,\u201d such as the woman whose metastatic breast cancer was repeatedly missed, Verghese said. In his view, the physical exam also represents an \u201cimportant transactional moment\u201d between doctor and patient \u2014 a laying-on of hands that helps foster trust.\n\nAn increasingly common complaint from patients, he said, is that \u201cthe doctor never touched me.\u201d\n\nOverreliance on technology, he said, has produced perverse results.\n\n\u201cIf you come to our hospital missing a finger,\u201d he quipped, \u201cno one will believe you until we get a CT scan, an MRI and an orthopedic consult.\u201d\n\nThe Stanford Medicine 25 program reflects Verghese\u2019s medical training in Ethiopia in the 1980s. Doctors were required to hone their clinical skills because technology was largely nonexistent.\n\nBut some experts are skeptical that reviving the physical exam is the best approach in the 21st century. Robert Wachter, former chair of the American Board of Internal Medicine, said he shares Verghese\u2019s concerns about declining clinical skills. But Wachter said he isn\u2019t sure that \u201crestoring the physical exam of yore\u201d is a solution.\n\n\u201cTaking time and energy to train doctors in the physical exam may be less valuable than teaching them how to communicate or to analyze \u2026 data,\u201d said Wachter, associate chair of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make some choices.\u201d\n\nTECH VS. TOUCH\n\nBut Steven McGee, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington and the author of a recent textbook on evidence-based physical diagnosis, said studies have found that physical exam findings can be as accurate as their technological counterparts.\n\nThe enormous amount of technology that doctors now must master has crowded out physical diagnosis, he said.\n\n\u201cThere is a giant chunk of diagnosis that still depends on what we see and detect\u201d through observation and a physical exam, he said. For a surprising number of diseases, McGee added, diagnosis is based on observation and examination, not a test. Among them are Parkinson\u2019s disease, shingles, drug rashes and constrictive pericarditis.\n\nMcGee said he once saw a nurse tell a resident that a patient had spiked a fever and watched as the young doctor frantically scrolled through the electronic medical record searching for a cause, instead of walking down the hall to the patient\u2019s room to discover the reason: an inflamed IV site.\n\nThese days, medical students often train on actors who are only pretending to have medical problems, notes Poonam Hosamani, a newly minted hospital-based internist who joined the Stanford team last year.\n\nHosamani said that she recently enlisted her husband, who has a bad knee, as a featured patient. Many students told her they had never seen a patient with a knee problem.\n\n\u201cWhen we bring in patients with real pathologies, the students are very excited about that,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to show them that this is worth their time and demonstrate how much information you can gain\u201d through a good exam, which is not intended to replace technology but to guide its use.\n\nInternist John Kugler, an assistant professor of medicine at Stanford, said that typically medical students learn diagnosis skills before they have seen patients.\n\n\u201cThey are taught where to put their hands, but these techniques are taught in isolation and there is little to no reinforcement,\u201d he said.\n\nW. Reid Thompson, a pediatric cardiologist at Hopkins, launched Murmurlab in part to curb unnecessary referrals for echocardiograms, which cost up to $900 apiece.\n\nDespite doctors\u2019 reliance on sophisticated tests, auscultation remains \u201ca fundamental clinical skill,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cEvery day \u2026 I walk up to a patient and the first thing I do is listen\u201d to the heart. \u201cPeople walk around with a stethoscope not just because it looks good or is expected, but because there is information to be learned.\u201d\n\nIn a recent essay, Arnold Relman, a former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, described the months he spent last summer at Massachusetts General Hospital after he broke his neck in a near-fatal fall.\n\n\u201cDoctors now spend more time with their computers than at the bedside,\u201d wrote Relman, an emeritus professor of medicine at Harvard. Reviewing records of his hospital stay, Relman \u201cfound only brief descriptions of how I felt and looked\u201d but \u201ccopious reports of the data from tests and monitoring devices.\u201d\n\nConversations with his doctors were \u201cinfrequent, brief and hardly ever reported.\u201d\n\nVANISHING SKILLS\n\nSome components of a physical exam are familiar, such as listening to the lungs and heart, and assessing blood pressure and pulse. But parts of the Stanford Medicine 25 \u2014 a list of skills that the school considers important \u2014 may be less familiar. Below are some of those bedside tests:\n\n\u25a0 Feel lymph nodes and differentiate benign enlargement from possible malignancy.\n\n\u25a0 Evaluate patient\u2019s walk for signs of neurological or musculoskeletal impairment.\n\n\u25a0 Inspect the tongue for the presence of infection or underlying illness.\n\n\u25a0 Feel the thyroid gland and palpate the spleen to check for enlargement.\n\n\u25a0 Assess the liver, checking for tenderness and enlargement, and recognize signs of liver disease elsewhere in the body.\n\n\u25a0 Evaluate tremors and involuntary movements.\n\n\u25a0 Examine fingernails for signs of kidney, heart or lung disease or nicotine use.\n\n\u25a0 Check shoulders for range of motion.\n\n\u25a0 Evaluate knees for pain and movement.\n\nSOURCE: stanfordmedicine25.stanford.edu/the25", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/07/DOCTOR-001.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaadc\"", "article_summary": "Had they done a simple physical exam of the woman\u2019s chest, they would have been able to feel the tumors.\nBut some experts are skeptical that reviving the physical exam is the best approach in the 21st century.\nBut over the past few decades the physical diagnosis skills that were once the cornerstone of doctoring have withered, supplanted by a dizzying array of sophisticated, expensive tests.\nBut Wachter said he isn\u2019t sure that \u201crestoring the physical exam of yore\u201d is a solution.\nThe generation of influential mentors who taught physical diagnosis has largely retired."}
