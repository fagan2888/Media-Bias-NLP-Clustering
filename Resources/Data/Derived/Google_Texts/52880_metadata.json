This triangular dynamic guiding policymaking in the past few years \u2014 from the credit downgrade to the fiscal cliff to the government shutdown \u2014 has led to the exclusion of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party from having much of a say in legislative affairs.\n\nLike the Republican Party, the Democratic Party is not without its own internal fissure \u2014 one that could widen and surface preceding the presidential primary process when the Democratic Party will have to reinvent itself in the waning months of the Obama era.\n\nAn ideological and organizational X-ray of the Democratic Party in Congress reveals a surprising split: there are approximately 20 members of the moderate Blue Dog Coalition in the legislature, while the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) boasts more than 60 members. With progressive and even nonpartisan outlets and pundits calling for progressive candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Governor Martin O\u2019Malley (D-Md.) to run, progressives \u2014 much ignored in the fracas of the last several years \u2014 might begin to find venues to ventilate their ideas.\n\nThe CPC \u2014 founded in 1991 and currently led by Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and Ra\u00fal Grijalva (D-Ariz.) \u2014 has been especially active since the 111th Congress took its collective seat in 2009 and has not been afraid to challenge the president during his politically-mandated drift rightward since taking office.\n\nFor instance, in addition to advocating for a public option as part of the Affordable Care Act, progressives have pushed for the Sanders-Leahy-Welch \u201cState Leadership in Healthcare Act\u201d to expedite the implementation of Section 1332 of the health care law, which provides waivers to states interested in finding innovative ways to administer health care. Progressives believe that Section 1332 can be a vehicle for the implementation of single-payer or single-payer-like insurance systems in states such as Vermont, Hawaii, Washington, and others.\n\nPerhaps the CPC\u2019s most significant contribution to public debate has been its iterations of budget proposals that counter the austerity measures advocated by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.).\n\nIn 2011, the CPC unveiled \u201cThe People\u2019s Budget\u201d in the House, and in 2012 it proposed \u201cThe Budget for All.\u201d In 2014, it unveiled \u201cThe Better Off Budget,\u201d which ambitiously promised to create 8.8 million jobs by 2017 \u2014 including 4.6 million after one year \u2014 and to reduce the deficit to 1.4 percent of GDP by FY2024 and to reduce the debt by $3.6 trillion over 10 years.\n\nTo stir job creation immediately and reduce the \u201coutput gap\u201d that has the economy operating at $800 billion below its potential, the CPC\u2019s budget allotted $1.35 trillion in money for direct job creation in infrastructure, green manufacturing, and research and development. To help the unemployed, the budget also called for restoring the emergency unemployment benefits that expired in December 2013 and would extend the duration up to 99 weeks as well as provide retroactive benefits \u2014 amounting to a total investment of $78 billion through FY2024.\n\nTo help the working and middle classes, The Better Off Budget also proposed a generous Hard Work Tax Credit and postponed the expiration of refundable tax credits, including the earned income tax credit (EITC), the child tax credit, and the tuition tax credit. It also proposed $126 billion in tax credits for businesses and a tax incentive for research and green manufacturing.\n\nTo balance this public spending, the budget also included numerous proposals predicted to add $6.6 trillion in revenue above the CBO\u2019s current projection over 10 years. The plan called for keeping the Bush tax cuts intact for filers making less than $200,000 while raising taxes for those above this threshold. It also created additional tax brackets, ranging from a 45 percent rate on filers making between $1 million and $10 million to a maximum rate of 49 percent for those making $1 billion or more.\n\nThe proposed tax code would have regarded income derived from labor and capital gains equally and would have eliminated or reduced the cap for deductions on items such as bonus pay, corporate jet provisions, and corporate meals and entertainment. It would also have ended a tax deduction for advertisements promoting unhealthy food to children and created a minor 0.35 percent tax on the largest financial institutions.\n\nDespite its highly expansionary fiscal stimulus \u2014 which neo-liberal economist Larry Summers believes is required to supplement the Federal Reserve\u2019s expansionary monetary policy and maximize productivity \u2014 and despite its long-term reduction of the deficit and debt, the budget failed to cut through the partisan chatter or establish itself as a legitimate rival to the Republicans\u2019 proposals.\n\nNevertheless, some of the CPC\u2019s other ideas have percolated upwards within the Democratic Party and caught the ear of the president, who has embraced the CPC\u201ds call for raising the minimum wage and ending LGBT discrimination for government contractors.\n\nThese recent proposals show that the CPC is becoming increasingly vocal. The co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, Keith Ellison, has been a consistent proponent of civil liberties in his criticisms of the PATRIOT Act and of the extensive reach of the NSA.\n\nThe CPC also calls for changing FCC policy to classify telecommunication services, such as the Internet, as public utilities in order to enable greater regulation of the industry and to protect net neutrality. It has also pressed the administration to be more transparent about its drone program.\n\nThese policy proposals and ideas demonstrate an adherence to its 4-item \u201cProgressive Promise,\u201d which includes \u201cfighting for economic justice and security,\u201d \u201cprotecting and preserving civil liberties,\u201d promoting global peace and security,\u201d and \u201cadvancing environmental protection [and] energy security.\u201d\n\nWith dissatisfaction with the president growing from his left flank, including in his handling of the budget, the economy, immigration, and government transparency and secrecy, the CPC and its allies may become major players in national and congressional politics in the near future.\n\nPhoto credit not attributed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Congressional Progressive Caucus has proposed numerous ideas in recent years, and its dissent from Obama could signify a rift in the Democratic Party.", "og": {"site_name": "IVN.us", "description": "The Congressional Progressive Caucus has proposed numerous ideas in recent years, and its dissent from Obama could signify a rift in the Democratic Party.", "title": "Congressional Progressive Caucus Increasingly Vocal, Critical of Obama - IVN.us", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/progressive-caucus.jpg", "height": 349}, "updated_time": "2014-08-04T10:05:53-07:00", "url": "http://ivn.us/2014/08/04/congressional-progressive-caucus-increasingly-vocal-critical-obama/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Congressional Progressive Caucus has proposed numerous ideas in recent years, and its dissent from Obama could signify a rift in the Democratic Party.", "title": "Congressional Progressive Caucus Increasingly Vocal, Critical of Obama - IVN.us", "image": "http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/progressive-caucus.jpg", "creator": "@IVN", "site": "@IVN", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-08-04T09:51:26-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 322111017868621, "pages": 233116802464}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IVN", "section": "Legislation", "tag": "privacy", "published_time": "2014-08-04T09:51:26-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-04T10:05:53-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "budget, congress, congressional progressive caucus, net neutrality, privacy, politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd9c8\"", "article_summary": "Like the Republican Party, the Democratic Party is not without its own internal fissure \u2014 one that could widen and surface preceding the presidential primary process when the Democratic Party will have to reinvent itself in the waning months of the Obama era.\nTo help the working and middle classes, The Better Off Budget also proposed a generous Hard Work Tax Credit and postponed the expiration of refundable tax credits, including the earned income tax credit (EITC), the child tax credit, and the tuition tax credit.\nWith progressive and even nonpartisan outlets and pundits calling for progressive candidates like Sen.
