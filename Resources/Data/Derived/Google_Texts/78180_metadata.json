What\u2019s more, the most contentious issues won\u2019t be resolved until late June, barely four months before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWhat started as a somewhat sleepy term \u2014 especially following major decisions last June on health care and same-sex marriage \u2014 has become much more interesting, says University of Pennsylvania law dean Theodore Ruger.\n\n\u201cThis is a court that remains very assertive in its role in declaring what the law is,\u201d Ruger said.\n\nThe accumulation of wrenching social issues and pointed policy disputes at the Supreme Court at this moment is mostly a matter of chance. A legal fight over the regulation of abortion clinics in Texas has been underway for two and a half years. President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to shield from deportation millions of immigrants who are living in the country illegally was rolled out a year ago and almost immediately challenged in court. Faith-based groups that say they are forced to be complicit in providing objectionable birth control to women covered under their health plans have been challenging the Obama administration for more than three years.\n\nIt is still is possible the immigration dispute will not be heard until next fall, if at all.\n\nNow that the cases are at the marble courthouse atop Capitol Hill, the justices\u2019 decisions could feed campaign rhetoric that already has been heated on abortion and immigration, to name just two issues.\n\nIn June 2012, Chief Justice John Roberts provided the decisive vote that saved Obama\u2019s health care overhaul in the midst of the president\u2019s campaign for re-election.\n\nA short time later, Republican candidate Mitt Romney proclaimed that as president he would do what the high court failed to do that June \u2014 get rid of the health care law. Obama won re-election, and the law survived.\n\nRuger said the chief justice wrote a nuanced opinion that appeared to show some sensitivity to the looming election.\n\n\u201cI think Roberts recognized this was going to be an issue in front of the voters,\u201d Ruger said. The electorate ultimately would decide the health care law\u2019s fate, he said.\n\nCourt decisions close to an election, especially when they produce big changes in the law, also can increase attention paid to those issues.\n\nThis is part of what Texas A&M University political scientist Joseph Ura called the court\u2019s agenda-setting effect. Ura pointed to Brown v. Board of Education\u2019s outlawing of racial segregation in public schools and Lawrence v. Texas\u2019 ban on state anti-sodomy laws as examples of past decisions that altered \u201cthe existing arrangement of material or symbolic benefits in our political system.\u201d Researchers found that those decisions \u201cled to a large, sustained increase in the media\u2019s attention\u201d to those issues, Ura said.\n\nLast term\u2019s big rulings on health care and same-sex marriage already have prompted criticism of the court, and of Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy in particular, from several Republican presidential candidates. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, for example, has said that putting Roberts on the court was a mistake, even though Cruz endorsed his nomination in 2005.\n\nThe court\u2019s 2010 decision in Citizens United that led to a flood of what critics call \u201cdark money\u201d in political campaigns remains controversial, and Democratic candidates have pledged to try to undo it.\n\nThe Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 that established a woman\u2019s right to an abortion produced a backlash that eventually showed up in election returns, said Sara Benesh, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. \u201cA lot of scholars say (President Ronald) Reagan got elected because of Roe v. Wade. Pro-life forces really got him moving in his campaign,\u201d Benesh said. With four justices in their late 70s or early 80s, and the court so closely and fiercely divided, any appointment could dramatically change the court\u2019s direction.\n\nBut there is little evidence that the court itself will become an issue in the campaign, except perhaps on the margins, she said.\n\nThe court and the justices are little known to the public. \u201cIt seems to me a long, drawn-out relationship between any decision the court might make and any decision an individual might make in the voting booth,\u201d Benesh said.\n\nEvery four years, interest groups across the political spectrum try to make that connection for voters. Elections matter, they say, because the winner may get to choose justices who will serve for the next quarter century or longer.\n\nIndeed, with four justices in their late 70s or early 80s, and the court so closely and fiercely divided, any appointment could dramatically change the court\u2019s direction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court's lineup of new cases is fit for an election year.
