Wilshusen declined to answer, saying he didn\u2019t want to make public the details of the website\u2019s security systems.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to tell how weak it still is,\u201d Issa said. \u201cI understand that.\u201d\n\nIssa\u2019s staff released a report this week detailing internal turf battles related to concerns about CMS oversight of the Healthcare.gov project before it launched. The report also alleges that CMS employees tried to cover up problems in the months before the site launched.\n\nCMS administrator Marilyn Tavenner and committee Democrats defended Healthcare.gov, saying the site has never had a data breach by malicious hackers that resulted in the loss of personal information. Issa and other Republicans noted that some website users were able to access the personal data of other users by mistake in the early weeks after Healthcare.gov\u2019s launch.\n\nInformation security is a top priority at Healthcare.gov, Tavenner said.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers also noted that more than 7.3 million formerly uninsured U.S. residents have signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare.\n\nWith huge data breaches recently at Target, Home Depot and other private companies, the committee\u2019s focus on Healthcare.gov is misguided, said Representative Jackie Speier, a California Democrat. The Oversight Committee has had nearly 30 hearings on the Affordable Care Act and Thursday\u2019s was the sixth on Healthcare.gov, Democrats noted.\n\nThe Target breach potentially affects a third of the U.S. population, Speier said. \u201cBut strangely, there wasn\u2019t any interest by this committee to have a hearing on that,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s see, 110 million people affected and no hearing. Zero people affected [by Healthcare.gov breaches], and we\u2019ve had dozens of hearings. It seems like our priorities are not quite on what the American people would be interested in.\u201d\n\nThe Oversight Committee\u2019s role is to focus on government operations, Issa countered. Other committees and government agencies are looking into recent breaches in the private sector, he said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://core5.staticworld.net/images/article/2013/11/pcworld-idgns-primaryimage-100154539-small.png", "description": "The US HHS doesn't require strong passwords in some systems and is slow to patch vulnerabilties, the GAO says", "og": {"site_name": "PCWorld", "description": "The US HHS doesn't require strong passwords in some systems and is slow to patch vulnerabilties, the GAO says", "title": "Auditor: Healthcare.gov still lacks some basic security controls", "url": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2685832/auditor-healthcaregov-still-lacks-some-basic-security-controls.html", "image": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/11/pcworld-idgns-primaryimage-100154539-gallery.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The US HHS doesn't require strong passwords in some systems and is slow to patch vulnerabilties, the GAO says", "title": "Auditor: Healthcare.gov still lacks some basic security controls | PCWorld", "url": "www.pcworld.com/article/2685832/auditor-healthcaregov-still-lacks-some-basic-security-controls.html", "image": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/11/pcworld-idgns-primaryimage-100154539-orig.png", "site": "@pcworld", "card": "summary", "account_id": 6070762}, "parsely-tags": "type: news,source: idg news service,imported", "DC.date.issued": "2014-09-18", "parsely-image-url": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/11/pcworld-idgns-primaryimage-100154539-gallery.png", "parsely-title": "Auditor: Healthcare.gov still lacks some basic security controls", "fb": {"app_id": 1542125639335283, "pages": 7352931005}, "sailthru.tags": "government,business,tech-events,grant-gross,news,medium", "parsely-author": "Grant Gross", "parsely-section": "Government", "date": "2014-09-18", "parsely-type": "NewsArticle", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-09-18T19:00:14Z", "sailthru.image.full": "http://core0.staticworld.net/images/article/2013/11/pcworld-idgns-primaryimage-100154539-gallery.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "parsely-link": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2685832/auditor-healthcaregov-still-lacks-some-basic-security-controls.html"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d30\"", "article_summary": "Healthcare.gov lacks several basic cybersecurity controls\u2014including strong passwords and consistent security patching\u2014nearly a year after the troubled launch of the insurance-shopping website, a government auditor said.\nWilshusen declined to answer, saying he didn\u2019t want to make public the details of the website\u2019s security systems.\nThe security problems GAO found \u201call can be corrected and resolved almost immediately,\u201d said Greg Wilshusen, the GAO\u2019s director of information security issues.\nGAO\u2019s recommended 28 changes that CMS could make at Healthcare.gov to improve the site\u2019s security, including a comprehensive security assessment of its insurance marketplace and the creation of detailed security roles and responsibilities of contractors.\nThe HHS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services hasn\u2019t required passwords of sufficient length or complexity on systems supporting the Healthcare.gov insurance marketplace, and the agency didn\u2019t consistently apply security patches, the GAO report said."}
