Betts, AIDS, FDA, LGBT, Suicide, Life News\n\nAlexander \u201cA.J.\u201d Betts\u2019 family says he was rejected in life for being gay. And in death, he was rejected for the same reason.\n\nAs KCCI News first reported earlier this week, the Iowa teen died in July of 2013 after \u201cyears of bullying\u201d for being gay. After he attempted suicide in his family\u2019s Pleasant Hill home, he was briefly put on life support to repair his organs so they\u2019d be acceptable for transplant. His last moments were in service of others. Months before his death, he\u2019d decided to become a donor.\n\nSpeaking a year later to local reporter Shaina Humphries, Betts\u2019 mother, Sheryl Moore, shared a letter thanking the family for Betts\u2019 gifts \u2013 his right kidney to a 49-year-old woman, his left to an 11-year-old boy, his liver and lungs to others. \u201cI was very happy to hear that a 14-year-old boy got his heart,\u201d she said. \u201cHe would have really liked that.\u201d\n\nBut because of inane, outdated FDA regulations going back to the earliest years of the AIDS crisis, Betts\u2019 eyes were deemed ineligible for donation. The FDA refuses to let men who\u2019ve had sexual contact with other men donate blood or donate tissue because they\u2019re considered a high risk. In March, the family of Rohn Neugebauer, a 48-year-old man who\u2019d raised thousands for the Center for Organ Recovery and Education, was told by the same organization that he was declined as a donor after his sudden death of a heart attack. His family claims it was because of his relationship with another man.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Why is the FDA still living in the '80s?", "title": "Teen rejected as a tissue donor \u2014 for being gay", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Why is the FDA still living in the '80s?", "title": "Teen rejected as a tissue donor \u2014 for being gay", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/15/teen_rejected_as_an_organ_donor_for_being_gay/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/sheryl_moore.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Why is the FDA still living in the '80s?", "title": "Teen rejected as a tissue donor \u2014 for being gay", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/sheryl_moore.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, A.J.
