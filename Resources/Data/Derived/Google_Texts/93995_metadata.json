Susan Collins won her race for re-election against Democratic challenger Shenna Bellows on Tuesday. The Associated Press announced the results based on exit polls.\n\nCollins employed a safe incumbent-defense strategy that emphasized the senator\u2019s reputation as a bipartisan coalition builder and her familiarity with Mainers, perhaps best illustrated by her campaign slogan, \u201cSusan Collins \u2013 our senator.\u201d All the while, her campaign worked hard in social and traditional media to portray Bellows\u2019 campaign as error-prone and the candidate as too liberal for Maine.\n\nVideos Additional Images Susan Collins gives her victory speech Tuesday night at the Westin Portland. The incumbent\u2019s campaign emphasized her reputation as a moderate Republican.

As the ACLU\u2019s chief spokeswoman and lobbyist for eight years, Bellows was heavily involved in legislative battles over abortion, voting rights, civil liberties and free speech.\n\nBellows impressed outside observers with her ability to raise more than $2 million largely on her own, her 350-mile \u201cWalk Across Maine\u201d and her willingness to go after Collins. She used the five joint debates to challenge Collins about her votes on issues such as the minimum wage, the Affordable Care Act and gender discrimination \u2013 key issues on the Democrats\u2019 national campaign agenda this year.\n\nBut Bellows\u2019 campaign never picked up the critical support of large, national political groups often necessary to help challengers unseat a well-funded incumbent, much less one with substantial cross-party appeal like Collins.\n\nDemocrats\u2019 two leading political action committees, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Senate Majority PAC, spent more than $100 million in more competitive races in hopes of retaining control of the chamber. Likewise, a number of high-profile organizations that typically lean left \u2013 such as the League of Conservation Voters and the Human Rights Campaign, the nation\u2019s largest gay rights group \u2013 endorsed Collins because of her reputation as a fairly reliable moderate vote in an increasingly conservative Republican caucus.\n\nCollins had raised more than $5.1 million as of Oct. 15 compared to $2.2 million for Bellows, according to financial reports filed with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nAt 39, Bellows is widely expected to run for political office again in Maine. When asked about it Tuesday night, though, she said, \u201cHonestly, I haven\u2019t thought beyond tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a positive movement for change, and we\u2019re in this for the long haul,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are so proud of how far we came and how close we stayed to our values. This was an extraordinary grass-roots effort.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Collins faced an energetic and bold challenger in Shenna Bellows, a first-time candidate who was executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Collins faced an energetic and bold challenger in Shenna Bellows, a first-time candidate who was executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine.", "title": "Susan Collins wins re-election to U.S. Senate - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/532139_229123-20141104_SusanColl3.jpg", "height": 738}, "updated_time": "2014-11-05T00:49:39-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/11/04/collins-wins-re-election-to-senate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Collins faced an energetic and bold challenger in Shenna Bellows, a first-time candidate who was executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine.", "title": "Susan Collins wins re-election to U.S. Senate - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/532139_229123-20141104_SusanColl3.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "News", "published_time": "2014-11-04T20:16:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-05T00:49:39-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0db9\"", "article_summary": "Videos Additional Images Susan Collins gives her victory speech Tuesday night at the Westin Portland.\nA former executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, Bellows was not widely known outside of Maine political circles but entered the race as both an experienced policy debater and a veteran of hard-fought campaigns.\nU.S. Sen.
