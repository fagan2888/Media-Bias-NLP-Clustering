NATO was started in the early days of the Cold War and grew to become a major bulwark against the then-Soviet Union. The fate, and the very relevance, of the 28-member alliance has become a hotly debated topic in the face of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea last year, its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine and its provocative actions around the globe, such as having military aircraft enter the airspace of several NATO member nations.\n\nBut others have echoed, in a way, Sanders\u2019 call for a new coalition focused on ISIS. Russia riled the global security order in September when it deployed weapons and personnel to Syria prop up the Assad regime, though the Kremlin maintains its forces are there to battle ISIS. Moscow and Washington eventually worked out a way to carry out their disparate bombing campaigns, but questions about increased coordination have arisen after ISIS bombed a Russian airliner in Egypt. The French government, enraged over last week\u2019s attacks, has launched waves of airstrikes on the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in Syria and struck an agreement to work together with Moscow.\n\nWhile the White House has flatly ruled out enhanced coordination \u2014 stating that Russia wants to keep Assad in power, a no-go for the administration \u2014 some in President Obama\u2019s own party have signaled an openness to the idea.\n\n\u201cThey are starting a new initiative against ISIL in Iraq and Syria. That is a step forward. And I think it's the beginning of a joint global effort \u2014 the United States, its NATO allies, Russia, other countries \u2014 to try to destroy this base of operations of ISIL,\u201d Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) said Tuesday during a news conference.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein (CA), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, also believes the U.S. should stop ignoring Russia\u2019s interests in the region.\n\nRelated: Can ISIS Save the Russian Economy for Putin?\n\n\"We need to be able to work with Russia and Iran, if they will work with us, in the Syria area. We need to be able to get a political solution to Assad so that all of everyone's attention can be directed to ISIL,\u201d she told MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell on Monday. \u201cWe're going to have to look at some new teams \u2014 new themes \u2014 and I think we will have to listen very carefully to our military people and ask for the kind of precise military strategy and tactics that might be able to really contain ISIL and defeat it.\u201d\n\nAside from floating a new alliance, Sanders largely stuck to his previous stances, criticizing America\u2019s allies in the Middle East, who he argues \u201chave contributed far too little in the fight against ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of this has got to change. Wealthy and powerful Muslim nations in the region can no longer sit on the sidelines and expect the United States to do their work for them,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders said the war with the terror organization, which released videos this week that threatened attacks in Washington and New York, \u201cmust be done primarily by Muslim nations with the strong support of their global partners.\u201d\n\nIn that way, his anti-ISIS policy resembles Clinton\u2019s. Earlier on Thursday she outlined her strategy for defeating the group, one that requires allies in the region, like the Arabs and Turks, to \u201cstep up\u201d their contribution against the group.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Democratic presidential contender has advanced another unconventional idea: that the U.S. put together a new international organization, similar to NATO but including Russia and Arab League countries, with a mission of defeating extremists.", "title": "Bernie Sanders Wants a New NATO, Including Russia, to Fight ISIS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/20/Bernie-Sanders-Wants-New-NATO-Including-Russia-Fight-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-sanders_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/20/Bernie-Sanders-Wants-New-NATO-Including-Russia-Fight-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-sanders_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Democratic presidential contender has advanced another unconventional idea: that the U.S. put together a new international organization, similar to NATO but including Russia and Arab League countries, with a mission of defeating extremists.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"We need to be able to work with Russia and Iran, if they will work with us, in the Syria area.\nBut others have echoed, in a way, Sanders\u2019 call for a new coalition focused on ISIS.\nNATO was started in the early days of the Cold War and grew to become a major bulwark against the then-Soviet Union.\nThe perceived lack of foreign policy bona fides was on display at the beginning of last week\u2019s Democratic presidential debate, when Sanders was pressed if he still believed climate change posed the greatest threat to national security.\nRelated: From Bombers to Subs, Inside Bush\u2019s Costly Plan to Expand the MilitarySanders\u2019 latest proposal might also draw some head-scratching."}
