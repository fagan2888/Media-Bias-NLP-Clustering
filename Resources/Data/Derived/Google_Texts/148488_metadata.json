Before his career in law enforcement, he served six years in the Army and spent about a decade in the computer industry in Silicon Valley.\n\nAmbrose, who was divorced, is survived by two children, said Frederick Frazier, chair of the Assist the Officer Foundation in Dallas.\n\nFrazier, who is also chair of the Dallas Police Association PAC, described Ambrose as a loyal and devoted officer. Even after his cancer diagnosis, Ambrose kept in touch with his colleagues and would not accept pity.\n\n\u201cFrom the moment I met him, he was a gentle warrior,\u201d Frazier said. \u201cHe was so proud to be a Dallas police officer. He was so proud he had served his country. And he never wanted anyone to feel sorry for him.\u201d\n\nAmbrose was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2013 after he felt dizzy and numb at the police department\u2019s rifle range. He was taken by ambulance to a hospital, where he got an MRI. Doctors found two brain tumors on the right side of his brain and diagnosed him with Stage 4 brain cancer.\n\nDuring Ambrose\u2019s battle with cancer, fellow officers rallied around him. They worked his shifts and helped raise money to pay his medical bills.\n\nFrazier said the cancer treatment, including visits to M.D. Anderson Center Center in Houston, led to many medical bills. Ambrose\u2019s cancer battle and financial challenges inspired the start of a catastrophic leave fund for officers, he said. Ambrose was the first recipient and two other officers have also benefited from it.\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending, but they will likely be held in Oregon, Frazier said. Ambrose is an Oregon native and most of his family lives there.\n\nThe Dallas Police Department sent an email to officers to notify them about Ambrose\u2019s death.\n\nDonations to Ambrose\u2019s family can be made through the Assist the Officer Foundation website or by phone at 214-747-6839.\n\nDonations can also be mailed to:\n\nAssist the Officer Fund\n\nAttn: Jeffrey Ambrose\n\n1412 East Griffin Street\n\nDallas, Texas 75215", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzAzL2RhbGxhcy1wb2xpY2Utb2ZmaWNlci1kaWVzLWFmdGVyLWZpZ2h0LXdpdGgtYnJhaW4tY2FuY2VyLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Melissa Repko", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Dallas police officer Jeff Ambrose died Saturday after a battle with brain cancer.
