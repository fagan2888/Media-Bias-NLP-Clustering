Or another person carrying a plate of fresh greens from the free farm-to-table lunch upstairs. There\u2019s also pingpong, foosball and darts.\n\nBut this is no startup.\n\nIt\u2019s Oracle, the database-system company founded 44 years ago by Larry Ellison. Or at least a new face of Oracle.\n\nA year after Oracle took over data tracker Datalogix and its building, the typical Oracle acquisition tale is not unfolding.\n\nInstead, Datalogix is infusing its personality into Oracle. And it\u2019s pumped! Literally. During an interview last week, Datalogix CEO Eric Roza, now senior vice president of Oracle Data Cloud, sported athletic pants and T-shirt that said, \u201cData is the new bacon.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you look at our top 60 executives at the company over the last four years Datalogix was independent, we\u2019ve retained 58,\u201d said Roza, who will use lunchtime to train employees in CrossFit. \u201cYou just don\u2019t hear that.\u201d\n\nDatalogix was Oracle\u2019s 103rd acquisition. The Silicon Valley technology firm isn\u2019t famous for perks or having much of a culture. Employee reviews on Glassdoor mention a decent employer with good benefits, minimal raises and the requisite bureaucracy of a business with 132,000 workers.\n\nBut where past Oracle acquisitions slice up new staff and move them to related corporate divisions, Roza\u2019s team seems to be calling the shots. Datalogix\u2019s employees make up more than half of the newish Oracle Data Cloud, which Oracle created in mid-2014 after buying online customer data firm BlueKai.\n\n\u201cWe have our own salesforce, our own engineering, our own product people and our own marketing people,\u201d Roza said. \u201cBeing in data and software that is so different, (Oracle said) we\u2019re going to keep it together as sort of an experiment. And the experiment has gone really well. Because we\u2019ve outperformed, we\u2019ve been able to get more and more purview over our destiny.\u201d\n\nAt noon, he heads to the gym a few steps from his desk to train employees in the art of CrossFit, a strength and conditioning program that mixes aerobic exercise and weightlifting.\n\n\u201cOne of my firm beliefs is that most work environments make people less healthy, and I wanted ours to be more healthy. That\u2019s embodied with the CrossFit gym we have,\u201d said Roza, who co-owns a CrossFit gym in Boulder with his wife. \u201cIt\u2019s really changed a lot of people\u2019s lives here.\u201d\n\nRoza, who feels culture is so important he added a paragraph about it in a securities filing to prepare Datalogix to go public, knew his team needed more space. With Oracle, they made a decision to move from Westminster and expand at Oracle\u2019s campus in Broomfield.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t want offices, no high cubes. We want open space, we want a contemporary feel. We want flow.\u2019 And they said, \u2018We\u2019ll do all that,\u2019 and that was awesome. And by the way, we have a CrossFit gym, and we need that,\u201d Roza recalled.\n\nThree weeks ago, Roza toured the future space in the Interlocken business park. It should be ready Oct. 1.\n\n\u201cWe said, \u2018This is great. Where\u2019s the CrossFit gym?\u2019 \u201d Roza said. \u201cI was preparing myself thinking they were going to try to get out of it. They said, \u2018Oh, you see that courtyard there?\u2019 Yeah. \u2018We\u2019re going to build you a little outbuilding with its own CrossFit gym.\u2019 \u201c\n\nPumped\n\nOracle\u2019s reportedly $1.2 billion-dollar purchase of Datalogix last year \u2014 the deal closed in January 2015 \u2014 was part of a major change for Oracle. The company sold large and costly software database services to large clients.\n\nBut as technology moved some of those duties online to the cloud, allowing faster updates and uniformity for corporate users, Oracle made a decision.\n\n\u201cI believe there was a lightswitch that went on. Perhaps Mr. Ellison came to a meeting and said, \u2018We\u2019re going to the cloud.\u2019 At that point, that\u2019s where you start to get the cultural change,\u201d said Chad Eschinger, research vice president at market researcher Gartner Inc. \u201cOracle is throwing everything it\u2019s got at this point.\u201d\n\nBig companies that gobble up little ones are looking for intellectual property and talent, said Nizar Tarhuni, analyst for venture-capital tracking firm PitchBook.\n\nBut larger companies must consider autonomy for smaller acquisitions leading in a new direction. The amount of venture capital available makes it enticing for smaller firms to retain independence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily newer but something that is more pronounced in the current day and age,\u201d Tarhuni said. \u201cThe incentive isn\u2019t there to be acquired by a bigger company when you have venture capital to employ the capital they need. If you can provide that autonomy to a younger company that is a strategic purchase, that\u2019s a win-win situation for both groups.\u201d\n\nWhen Datalogix toyed with an initial public offering, buyers began to make offers. The CEO of advertising agency WPP told Business Insider last month it was interested but couldn\u2019t beat Oracle\u2019s $1.2 billion bid.\n\nDatalogix held a key element to the future of commerce. Using its data tools and 1,500 partners with access to 110 million households, the company helps marketers connect a person\u2019s online and offline shopping habits to prove a marketing campaign worked. By the time Oracle announced the acquisition Dec. 22, 2014, Datalogix had insight on $2 trillion of consumer spending.\n\nOmar Tawakol, CEO and co-founder of BlueKai, the cloud-based data manager Oracle purchased several months earlier, led the purchase of Datalogix. Tawakol is now general manager of Oracle Data Cloud and is Roza\u2019s boss.\n\nWith Tawakol in charge, the combination was a strategic fit that made sense because of a shared entrepreneurial bent and common focus, said Sandy Miller, general partner at IVP, whose venture firm led the $25 million round invested in Datalogix in 2013. Datalogix raised about $87 million before getting acquired.\n\n\u201cOracle has been good on its word. They\u2019ve kept the team together, and business has expanded. The team is happy; the investors are happy. It\u2019s easy to say it\u2019s a win-win because people say that all the time,\u201d said Miller, who credits Roza\u2019s leadership. \u201cBut this time, it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nCulture pays\n\nStanding at one\u2019s desk for health reasons isn\u2019t mandated. But by promoting fitness, Datalogix employees saw health care premiums rise just one-third that of the rest of the tech industry for the past three years.\n\nHaving a CrossFit gym also helps recruit. Roza, who meets with all new employees, said that when he met eight new workers late last year and asked, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d three responded with \u201cCrossFit.\u201d\n\nLike at Datalogix, Oracle allows the group to banish performance reviews tied to compensation. Oracle also kept Datalogix\u2019s workforce training and leadership programs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got 10 to 15 offices now and 850 employees. How does this scale? It turns out, it does. Instead of Datalogix 101, it\u2019s now ODC 101. We did this last week, and we had 100 people here,\u201d Roza said. \u201cWe had at least a dozen people outside of ODC. There were people from (Oracle\u2019s) legal team who wanted to learn more about what we do.\u201d\n\nThe ability to offer more training helps recruit and retain employees. Since the Oracle acquisition, the group has hired 150 new workers with about half from the Denver area.\n\nOracle doesn\u2019t break out financial results for the cloud group, but Roza shared a hint about its financial performance: \u201cFor the last quarter, our business had more than doubled the growth rate in our budget. You don\u2019t usually see an acquisition do that. Usually what you see is people miss plans and hopefully recover.\u201d\n\nWith results much better than expected, Roza has no regrets about choosing the acquisition path.\n\n\u201cI felt like the numbers we posted last quarter would have been a problem for a public company because we were so far ahead of anything we would have forecast,\u201d Roza said. \u201cI would have lost my credibility as a CEO. And (growth) is directly attributable to our ability to retain this engaged workforce, our operating autonomy and the way the broader Oracle team has supported us.\u201d\n\nTamara Chuang: tchuang@denverpost.com or visit dpo.st/tamara", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Datalogix, Oracle ask: Is Data the new bacon?", "title": "Datalogix, Oracle ask: Is Data the new bacon?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/05/datalogix-oracle-ask-is-data-the-new-bacon/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160207__Oracle_Datap1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160207__Oracle_Datap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-05T20:20:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T05:26:59+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Datalogix\u2019s employees make up more than half of the newish Oracle Data Cloud, which Oracle created in mid-2014 after buying online customer data firm BlueKai.\nThat\u2019s embodied with the CrossFit gym we have,\u201d said Roza, who co-owns a CrossFit gym in Boulder with his wife.\nTawakol is now general manager of Oracle Data Cloud and is Roza\u2019s boss.\nWESTMINSTER \u2014 Step inside building 2 of Westmoor Technology Park, and you might bump into an employee leaving the CrossFit gym tucked inside.\nA year after Oracle took over data tracker Datalogix and its building, the typical Oracle acquisition tale is not unfolding."}
