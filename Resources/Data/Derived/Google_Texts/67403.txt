Two police officers per department can fly for free using any of the New York City-bound routes, the New York Daily News reported.

Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were killed in an ambush attack Saturday when Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, of Georgia, fired several rounds through the passenger-side window of the officers' patrol car in Bedford-Stuyvesant, authorities said. Brinsley then fled on foot to a nearby subway station where he committed suicide.

The killings prompted Newark police to pull one-officer patrol cars off the streets.

Ramos' funeral is scheduled for Saturday at Christ Tabernacle Church in Glendale, New York at 10 a.m. Funeral services for Liu have not been announced.

Police departments can contact 1-800-JETBLUE to book a flight, the newspaper reported.
