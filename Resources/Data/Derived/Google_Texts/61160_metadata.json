The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has received upward of 5,500 reports of adverse health side effects related to the contraceptive device containing estrogen and progestin.\n\nAccording to its website, NuvaRing\u2019s major risks include blood clots, strokes and heart attacks, high blood pressure and heart disease, reproductive organ and breast cancer, gallbladder disease, liver tumors, lipid metabolism, and inflammation of the pancreas. More common side effects of the contraceptive device are vaginal infection, vaginal secretion, headache, weight gain, and nausea.\n\nMerck\u2019s sales of NuvaRing reached $623 million in the middle of over two years of lawsuits claiming the device led to health complications and, in some cases, even death. As of May 2013, 1,163 injury lawsuits were filed against Merck including 40 women who died using NuvaRing. The FDA has received 5,500 reports of NuvaRing side effects since 1997; 47 percent of these reports include pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and metrorrhagia.\n\nFollowing its approval by the FDA back in 2001, NuvaRing quickly became the most popular form of birth control on the pharmaceutical market. Merck\u2019s competition in the contraceptive industry, German drugmaker Bayer AG, also paid out a large sum to plaintiffs recently due to controversy surrounding two of its contraceptive products. Bayer paid a settlement of $1.6 billion in the shadow of 6,760 lawsuits. Behind Bayer, Merck is considered the second largest U.S. drugmaker, Bloomberg reported.\n\nWomen with a history of blood clots, heart attack or stroke, breast cancer, those pregnant, aged 35 or older, suffer from migraines, and those who smoke cigarettes are more susceptible to NuvaRing\u2019s side effects.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "merck, nuvaring", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Merck & Co. has agreed to pay a $100 million settlement in the face of over 1,000 injury lawsuits.", "title": "Merck Agrees To Pay $100M Following Allegations Of Downplaying Health Risks", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nuvaring-settlement-merck-agrees-pay-100m-following-allegations-downplaying-health-risks-268864", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/07/nuvaring.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Merck & Co. has agreed to pay a $100 million settlement in the face of over 1,000 injury lawsuits.", "title": "Merck Agrees To Pay $100M Following Allegations Of Downplaying Health Risks", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nuvaring-settlement-merck-agrees-pay-100m-following-allegations-downplaying-health-risks-268864", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/07/nuvaring.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/07/nuvaring.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-02-07T12:53:32-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-07T12:53:31-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Merck & Co. has agreed to pay a $100 million settlement in the face of over 1,000 injury lawsuits."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd37e\"", "article_summary": "More common side effects of the contraceptive device are vaginal infection, vaginal secretion, headache, weight gain, and nausea.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has received upward of 5,500 reports of adverse health side effects related to the contraceptive device containing estrogen and progestin.\nAs of May 2013, 1,163 injury lawsuits were filed against Merck including 40 women who died using NuvaRing.\nFollowing its approval by the FDA back in 2001, NuvaRing quickly became the most popular form of birth control on the pharmaceutical market.\nThe FDA has received 5,500 reports of NuvaRing side effects since 1997; 47 percent of these reports include pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and metrorrhagia."}
