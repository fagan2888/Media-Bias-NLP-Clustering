Shares had topped the $500 mark several times throughout the morning, jumping nearly 15% at their peak.\n\nIntuitive\u2019s da Vinci Xi won the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, paving the way for the company to start selling it. Representatives for the company say the Xi\u2019s single-console version will be the same price of the da Vinci Si, the most recent version, at $1.85 million apiece. For a dual-console version that can accommodate two surgeons operating the device, the price will be $2.3 million.\n\nThe da Vinci Xi is expected to be used in abdominal surgeries and is designed to be minimally invasive.\n\nIntuitive\u2019s share surge comes after a long slump that began about a year ago when the FDA said it was scrutinizing the company\u2019s devices after a series of complaints. Shares dropped considerably, having neared the $600 level before the news came out. They fell again in July after the company announced an earnings warning and several downgrades ensued.\n\nComing out with a successor in the da Vinci line boosts its fortunes at a time when analysts are becoming concerned Intuitive\u2019s technology will get left behind.\n\nFollow Russ Britt on Twitter @russbrittmktw.\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog.\n\nMore health-care news from MarketWatch:\n\nObamacare hit 7 million signups on last frantic day\n\nA look at the last, tumultuous day of Obamacare signups\n\nMore last-minute troubles with HealthCare.gov", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-04-01T12:19:05-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Shares of Intuitive Surgical settle somewhat after reaching lofty highs early in Tuesday trading as the company announced regulatory approval for its latest version of the da Vinci robotic surgery systems.", "title": "Intuitive shares revisit lofty heights on approval for new robotic surgeon", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/04/01/intuitive-shares-revisit-lofty-heights-on-approval-for-new-robotic-surgeon/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BY025_intuit_MG_20140401105340.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "da Vinci surgery systems,Intuitive Surgical,robotic surgeon", "article.headline": "Intuitive shares revisit lofty heights on approval for new robotic surgeon", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "da Vinci surgery systems,Intuitive Surgical,robotic surgeon", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "Shares of Intuitive Surgical settle somewhat after reaching lofty highs early in Tuesday trading as the company announced regulatory approval for its latest version of the da Vinci robotic surgery systems.", "article.published": "2014-04-01T12:19:05-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/04/01/intuitive-shares-revisit-lofty-heights-on-approval-for-new-robotic-surgeon/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Shares of Intuitive Surgical settle somewhat after reaching lofty highs early in Tuesday trading as the company announced regulatory approval for its latest version of the da Vinci robotic surgery systems.", "title": "Intuitive shares revisit lofty heights on approval for new robotic surgeon", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/04/01/intuitive-shares-revisit-lofty-heights-on-approval-for-new-robotic-surgeon/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BY025_intuit_MG_20140401105340.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2327", "article.updated": "2014-04-01T12:19:05-04:00"}, "article_summary": "The da Vinci Xi is expected to be used in abdominal surgeries and is designed to be minimally invasive.\nShares of Intuitive Surgical settled somewhat after reaching lofty highs early in Tuesday trading as the company announced regulatory approval for its latest version of the da Vinci robotic surgery system.\nIntuitive\u2019s da Vinci Xi won the approval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, paving the way for the company to start selling it.\nStill, Intuitive /quotes/zigman/90651/delayed /quotes/nls/isrg ISRG shares posted a healthy gain of more than 8% to $474.03 in recent action.\nComing out with a successor in the da Vinci line boosts its fortunes at a time when analysts are becoming concerned Intuitive\u2019s technology will get left behind."}
