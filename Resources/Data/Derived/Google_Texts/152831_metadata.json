Sturgeon, president of the Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute. \u201cHome care workers \u2014 the backbone of the nation\u2019s long-term care system \u2014 deserve better. \u201c\n\n\n\nCritics, who say the rules will raise the cost of healthcare for some Americans, seized on the delay as evidence that the regulations are ill-conceived and should be abandoned.\n\n\n\nAmong them is Sen.

Last week, Alexander led a group of nearly two-dozen Republicans in opposition to the rule.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe fact that the department plans to ignore its own rule after it goes into effect should be proof enough that it should be scrapped altogether,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The regs extend minimum wage and overtime rights to millions of home healthcare workers.", "description": "The regs extend minimum wage and overtime rights to millions of home healthcare workers.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Ben Goad", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The regs extend minimum wage and overtime rights to millions of home healthcare workers.", "title": "Feds delay penalties on home health aides' pay", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/labor/220066-feds-delay-enforcement-of-pay-rules-for-home-health-aides", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:09-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/labor/220066-feds-delay-enforcement-of-pay-rules-for-home-health-aides", "dcterms.date": "2014-10-07T18:09-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Ben Goad", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Lamar Alexander,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-07T18:09:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/labor/220066-feds-delay-enforcement-of-pay-rules-for-home-health-aides", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The regs extend minimum wage and overtime rights to millions of home healthcare workers.", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds delay penalties on home health aides' pay"}, "dcterms.title": "Feds delay penalties on home health aides' pay"}, "article_summary": "In it, the Labor Department makes clear that the regulations will come into force in January as scheduled.\n\u201cHome care workers \u2014 the backbone of the nation\u2019s long-term care system \u2014 deserve better.\nAmong them is Sen.
