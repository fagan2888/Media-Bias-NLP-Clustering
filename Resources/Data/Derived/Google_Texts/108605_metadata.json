Holly Mitchell (D-Los Angeles), would require students entering elementary school in California to have a thorough eye exam by a physician, optometrist or ophthalmologist. Repeat vision testing would be required every second year.\n\nToday, only a school nurse needs to check a student\u2019s vision upon entrance into elementary school and again in second, fifth and eighth grade. The nurse typically checks for near and far sightedness and color blindness.\n\nSupporters of SB 402 contend that this school-based exam can miss serious eye problems that hamper classroom learning and attention. The bill would require students to be tested for 11 eye conditions, including stigmatism, ability to focus and how well eyes track and work together, Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cDetecting vision problems through more comprehensive exams will ensure that every child has the same opportunity and potential to learn,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\nParents would not face penalties for not providing these tests to their children. However, the Affordable Care Act includes a comprehensive child vision exam as part of health plans\u2019 essential benefits package.\n\nGlenn Kawaguchi, board member of the California State Board of Optometry, which sponsored the bill, said that current education codes related to vision are lacking. Some 33% of children who pass a basic vision screening have significant eye problems, according to CDC.\n\n\u201cI see several children each week in my practice who are slipping through the cracks and it just breaks my heart,\u201d Kawaguchi said. \u201cOne child not doing well in school because of vision impairment is one too many.\u201d\n\nOpponents of the bill include Kaiser Permanente and the California Academy of Family Physicians.\n\n\u201cOur eye health providers have some problems with mandating such a significant eye exam for children,\u201d said Teresa Stark, director of government affairs for Kaiser Permanente, adding that there is disagreement in the scientific community about which vision tests should be performed on children.\n\nThe bill passed the state Senate Education Committee in April with a 7-0 vote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>A bill in the California Legislature calling for comprehensive eye exams for school age children got its second unanimous committee endorsement this week.</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "A bill in the California Legislature calling for comprehensive eye exams for school age children got its second unanimous committee endorsement this week.", "title": "Children\u2019s Eye Exam Bill Advances", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/childrens-eye-exam-bill-advances/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2015-05-01T03:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-01T03:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd25ee\"", "article_summary": "Supporters of SB 402 contend that this school-based exam can miss serious eye problems that hamper classroom learning and attention.\nHowever, the Affordable Care Act includes a comprehensive child vision exam as part of health plans\u2019 essential benefits package.\nSB 402, by state Sen.
