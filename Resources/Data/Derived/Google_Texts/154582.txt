At 11:30 p.m. tonight, "Saturday Night Live" is going to party like it's 1999 and "Fight Club" just came out as Edward Norton takes the stage to host the show in true throwback fashion.

Surprisingly enough, this is Norton's first time hosting "SNL." The Oscar nominated actor has been out of the spotlight for the most part since starring in "The Incredible Hulk" in 2008.

Norton is set to make a comeback of sorts in 2014, with films like "Birdman" starring opposite the likes of Emma Stone and Naomi Watts.

Janelle Monae, who was just named Billboard magazine's 2013 Rising Star with her new album "Electric Lady," will be tonight's musical guest.
