So how come the Republicans give up so quickly? Why don\u2019t they just use budget reconciliation in this case? They tell us they\u2019re serious about opposing Obama\u2019s executive amnesty, but they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cthey don\u2019t want to stop Obama\u2019s executive amnesty. And so that\u2019s why they\u2019re not going to really work on this.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201cthe idea was that rather than risk a wider government shutdown over Obama\u2019s amnesty, Republicans would focus on the Department of Homeland Security funding, and they would risk a limited shutdown of that department and that department only if Obama and the Democrats refused to scale back his amnesty intentions. But when it came down to the final counting, the Republicans were never really willing to shut down DHS either, and they made no secret of the fact, the Republicans were bluffing, and they admitted they were bluffing\u2026so the Democrats have no reason to support the Republican bill. The whole thing is an out-and-out joke, folks.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rush Limbaugh declared that GOP leaders \"don't want to stop Obama's executive amnesty...that's why they're not going to really work on this\"", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Rush Limbaugh declared that GOP leaders \"don't want to stop Obama's executive amnesty...that's why they're not going to really work on this\"", "title": "Rush: GOP Leaders 'Don't 'Want to Stop Obama's Executive Amnesty' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Limbaugh18a.jpg", "height": 450}, "updated_time": "2015-02-11T12:25:50-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/02/11/rush-gop-leaders-dont-want-to-stop-obamas-executive-amnesty/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rush Limbaugh declared that GOP leaders \"don't want to stop Obama's executive amnesty...that's why they're not going to really work on this\"", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Limbaugh18a.jpg", "title": "Rush: GOP Leaders 'Don't 'Want to Stop Obama's Executive Amnesty' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "executive amnesty, illegal immigration, immigration, Rush Limbaugh,Border, Breitbart TV, Immigration,executive amnesty", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-02-11T12:15:10-07:00", "section": "Border", "modified_time": "2015-02-11T12:25:50-07:00", "tag": "Rush Limbaugh", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Immigration,Border"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "They tell us they\u2019re serious about opposing Obama\u2019s executive amnesty, but they\u2019re not.\u201dHe continued, \u201cthey don\u2019t want to stop Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTalk radio host Rush Limbaugh declared that GOP leaders \u201cdon\u2019t want to stop Obama\u2019s executive amnesty and so that\u2019s why they\u2019re not going to really work on this\u201d on Wednesday.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cThe Republicans are all set to squander it again\u201d he stated.\nWhy don\u2019t they just use budget reconciliation in this case?\nThe whole thing is an out-and-out joke, folks.\u201dFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"}
