He explained how difficult it is to obtain the proper standing to sue to a sitting U.S. president \u2014 noting that a lawsuit he brought against Obama for the non-authorized attack on Libya in 2011 was thrown out for that very reason.\n\nBut this lawsuit could be very different. \u201cSo the first hurdle is going to be that standing issue, and it\u2019s a high one. But it\u2019s not necessarily insurmountable,\u201d Turley explained. \u201cThe court has never truly closed the door on what\u2019s called \u2018legislative standing,\u2019 particularly if it\u2019s based on the institution \u2014 if the House of Representatives empowers the group that litigates this case.\u201d\n\nPut simply, Turley believes that a court may actually allow a challenge to a U.S. president as part of a legitimate showdown between the executive and legislative branches of the United States government.\n\nCorrection: Boehner announced the lawsuit Wednesday.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Brendan Bordelon", "description": "'He has crossed the constitutional line'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Left-wing law professor Jonathan Turley baffled his MSNBC cohorts on Wednesday when he claimed House Republicans have a real case in their lawsuit against President Obama for executive overreach, expl", "title": "Liberal Law Professor Jonathan Turley Thinks Congress Could Win Its New Lawsuit Against Obama", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/06/25/liberal-law-professor-jonathan-turley-thinks-congress-could-win-their-new-lawsuit-against-obama/", "image": {"width": 2810, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Jonathan-Turley2-e1403744401618.jpg", "height": 1199}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'He has crossed the constitutional line'", "title": "Liberal Law Professor Jonathan Turley Thinks Congress Could Win Its New Lawsuit Against Obama Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/06/25/liberal-law-professor-jonathan-turley-thinks-congress-could-win-their-new-lawsuit-against-obama/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Jonathan-Turley2-e1403744401618.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-25 21:48:36", "sailthru.title": "Liberal Law Professor Jonathan Turley Thinks Congress Could Win Its New Lawsuit Against Obama", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama,congress,john-boehner,brendan-bordelon", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "barack obama,congress,john boehner,jonathan turley", "sailthru.description": "Left-wing law professor Jonathan Turley baffled his MSNBC cohorts on Wednesday when he claimed House Republicans have a real case in their lawsuit against President Obama for executive overreach, expl", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Jonathan-Turley2-e1403744401618.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb880\"", "article_summary": "And after being asked by MSNBC host Steve Kornacki whether Boehner had \u201cany kind of a case\u201d with the lawsuit, Turley remained consistent.\n\u201cWhile I happen to agree with him \u2014 I voted for him \u2014 I think this is a problem,\u201d Turley asserted.\n\u201cLike, what specific issue has he crossed it on?\u201d\u201cWell, when the president went to Congress and said that he was going to go it alone, it obviously raises a concern,\u201d Turley noted.\nThe George Washington professor noted, however, that the lawsuit won\u2019t necessarily be cut-and-dried.\n\u201cI think there is a case against the president for exceeding his authority,\u201d he declared."}
