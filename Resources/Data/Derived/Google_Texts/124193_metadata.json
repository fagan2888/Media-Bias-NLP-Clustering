They can be, if they are pushed the wrong way, combative, but they are not combative. A lot of we men are combative just by nature.\u201d\n\nThe majority leader, like so many other people who are probably well-meaning and genuinely want to see women better represented in leadership roles, seems to think women\u2019s supposedly innate niceness is the reason why we should be given a turn at the wheel. He\u2019s reducing the chain of events that have led us to this moment \u2014 not just the gains of the feminist movement but the decades-long political marathon Clinton has run to be positioned where she is right now \u2014 to some Mars/Venus pop psychology about the country badly needing a woman\u2019s delicate touch.\n\nNow taking issue with this kind of \u201ccompliment\u201d is, I\u2019d say, among the top 5 reasons that I get angry emails telling me to lighten up and how I am the reason that men are afraid to say anything at all and have to cower in terrified silence all day every day. The general gist is something like, You can\u2019t even say something nice about a woman anymore without someone jumping down your throat!\n\nBut as I\u2019ve written before, though there is evidence to suggest that women have better track records on working collaboratively, listening to viewpoints different than their own and having a stomach for debate and compromise \u2014 that I totally agree would well serve the country \u2014 that doesn\u2019t make the traits biologically determined. In fact, research suggests that women may be more effective leaders because, with so few represented in positions of power, the risks of failure are much higher. Put frankly, they simply have more to prove.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reid thinks a Clinton win is inevitable because Americans want a lighter, feminine touch in the White House", "title": "One is not born, but rather becomes, a Hillary Clinton: What Harry Reid gets wrong about women in politics", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Reid thinks a Clinton win is inevitable because Americans want a lighter, feminine touch in the White House", "title": "One is not born, but rather becomes, a Hillary Clinton: What Harry Reid gets wrong about women in politics", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/03/one_is_not_born_but_rather_becomes_a_hillary_clinton_what_harry_reid_gets_wrong_about_women_in_politics/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/reid_clinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Reid thinks a Clinton win is inevitable because Americans want a lighter, feminine touch in the White House", "title": "One is not born, but rather becomes, a Hillary Clinton: What Harry Reid gets wrong about women in politics", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/reid_clinton.jpg", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016, 2016 Elections, benevolent sexism, Harry Reid, Hillary Clinton, subtle sexism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: 2016, 2016 Elections, benevolent sexism, Harry Reid, Hillary Clinton, subtle sexism, Politics NewsHarry Reid is retiring at the end of this term, and he\u2019s doing a lot of thinking about the future of the Democratic Party as he inches closer to sweet, sweet retirement.\nThey can be, if they are pushed the wrong way, combative, but they are not combative.\nThe general gist is something like, You can\u2019t even say something nice about a woman anymore without someone jumping down your throat!\nIn fact, research suggests that women may be more effective leaders because, with so few represented in positions of power, the risks of failure are much higher.\n\u201cWomen are much more patient."}
