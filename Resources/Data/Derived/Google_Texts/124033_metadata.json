The updated policy specifically protects transgender and gender non-conforming individuals from discrimination in areas of employment, public accommodation, and housing.\n\nAccording to the city, gender non-conforming individuals is a term \u201cused to describe someone whose gender expression differs from traditional gender-based stereotypes.\u201d\n\nUnder the new policy, landlords, employers, and businesses can face civil penalties up to $125,000 per violation and up to $250,000 \u201cfor violations that are the result of willful, wanton, or malicious conduct.\u201d\n\nAccording to the city, violations include:\n\nIntentionally failing to use an individual\u2019s preferred name, pronoun, or title . For example, repeatedly calling a transgender woman \u201chim\u201d or \u201cMr.\u201d when she has made it clear that she prefers female pronouns and a female title.\n\nRefusing to allow individuals to use single-sex facilities, such as bathrooms or locker rooms, and participate in single-sex programs, consistent with their gender identity. For example, barring a transgender woman from a women\u2019s restroom out of concern that she will make others uncomfortable.\n\nEnforcing dress codes, uniforms, and grooming standards that impose different requirements based on sex or gender . For example, enforcing a policy that requires men to wear ties or women to wear skirts.\n\nFailing to providing employee health benefits that cover gender-affirming care or failing to provide reasonable accommodations for individuals undergoing gender transition, including medical appointments and recovery, where such reasonable accommodations are provided to other employees. (Federal and New York laws already require certain types of insurance to cover medically-necessary transition-related care.\n\n\u201cThis is essentially a speech crime law,\u201d Jeremy Tedesco, senior counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom, told The Daily Signal. \u201cYou can be fined up to $250,000 if you use the pronoun \u2018he\u2019 to refer to a man.\u201d\n\nThe guidance has the support of prominent LGBT groups, including the New York Civil Liberties Union, the New York City Anti Violence Project, and the National Center for Transgender Equality.\n\n\u201cLaws that protect gender identity nondiscrimination are essential, and it is detailed guidance like this that makes the promise of the law a reality in the everyday lives of transgender people,\u201d said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, in a press release.\n\nThe legal guidance also has the backing of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said the protections would ensure \u201cthat every transgender and gender non-conforming person in New York receives the dignity and respect they deserve.\u201d\n\nBut with threats of thousands of dollars in fines, critics fear that the New York City Commission on Human Rights has gone too far.\n\n\u201cWhen you start seeing $250,000 in fines you could face as a small restaurant owner, you just comply,\u201d Tedesco said, suggesting that a \u201cchilling effect\u201d would take place.\n\nIn a press release, the New York City Commission on Human Rights boasted about the broad scope of the new guidelines, stating that they go \u201cfurther\u201d than other major cities.\n\n\u201cNew York City\u2019s Human Rights Law now goes further in protecting the rights of transgender and gender non-conforming people than many large municipalities with gender identity protections,\u201d they said. \u201cCities such as Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Philadelphia do not articulate such specific protections under their laws.\u201d\n\nTedesco argued that the New York City Commission on Human Rights has \u201cextremely overreached on the guidelines they\u2019ve passed\u201d and is hopeful state legislators will address the issue themselves.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that they\u2019re guidelines, so hopefully some pushback can get them to pull back,\u201d he added.\n\nBut in the meantime, New York City Human Rights Commissioner Carmelyn Malalis promised to \u201caggressively\u201d enforce the protections in order to ensure the safety of transgender and gender non-conforming individuals.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s guidance makes it abundantly clear what the city considers to be discrimination under the law and the commission will continue to aggressively enforce protections to make that promise a reality,\u201d Malalis said. \u201cEvery New Yorker deserves to live freely and safely, free from discrimination.\u201d\n\nAccording to the city, an estimated 25,000 transgender and gender non-conforming people live in the Big Apple.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New York City announced \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cbold\u201d protections for transgender and gender non-conforming individuals.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "New York City announced \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cbold\u201d protections for transgender and gender non-conforming individuals.", "title": "Use Wrong Pronoun for Transgender Person?
