At the time of Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy, for example, its pension plan was underfunded by over $3 billion, but the unfunded deficit in its retiree health care plan was close to $6 billion.\n\nThe good news is that retiree health care plans can legally be revised more easily than pension plans. In specific, the US Supreme Court has recently issued an opinion setting forth principles of contract interpretation that will lead local governments and public unions to reach explicit agreements on the scope of such plans. Those agreements will probably have to include some cost reductions because the health care plans of many local governments will otherwise be subject to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s 40 percent \u201cCadillac\u201d tax starting in 2018.\n\nThis post will be divided into four parts. It will explain\n\nthe reasons why retiree health care plans have stayed under the radar screen and how that is changing; the magnitude of underfunding of retiree health care plans and the implications for state-city budgets; the principles of interpreting collective bargaining agreements recently enunciated by the US Supreme Court; and the various ways local governments are now trying to manage down their health care obligations over time and strategies that governments and public-sector unions can use to address this challenge.\n\nStaying Below The Radar Screen\n\nApproximately 77 percent of all local governments pay most of the health care premiums for their retirees from the time they retire (often before age 55) until they join Medicare at age 65. Then many local governments continue to pay most of the Medicare premiums for their retirees, and sometimes their premiums for supplemental health insurance (e.g., Medigap). These retiree health care plans are quite costly for local governments. The plans generally offer a broad range of high-quality services, including dental and eye care, with small or no deductibles and co-payments.\n\nBefore 2006, however, local governments were not required by the Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) to publicly disclose their \u201cother postemployment benefits\u201d (OPEBs) \u2014 composed almost entirely of health care benefits. So it was easy for politicians to approve generous health care plans whose financial effects would not be felt for decades, when those politicians were no longer in office.\n\nLast year GASB proposed to tighten the rules on OPEBs in two key respects. First, it proposed to establish a uniform discount rate for calculating unfunded health care obligations at a level significantly lower than the rate currently utilized by most local governments. A discount rate is applied to reduce long-term liabilities by taking into account the relatively certain investment returns on a plans\u2019 assets, which help finance future benefit payments. Accordingly, a lower discount rate would mean higher unfunded liabilities for retiree health care plans.\n\nGASB also proposed that local governments go beyond the public disclosures required since 2006\u2014in the footnotes to their financial statements\u2014by showing their projected health care obligations as liabilities on their balance sheets. This accounting change would emphasize the financial impact of these unfunded health care obligations, hopefully leading to more attention from local voters and bond rating agencies.\n\nNevertheless, even GASB has NOT proposed that local governments set aside monies to help finance their future health care obligations, as states and cities usually do for pension obligations. A discount rate is applied to reduce long-term liabilities by taking into account the relatively certain investment returns on plans assets, which help finance future benefit payments. By contrast, state and city governments have on average pre-funded less than 5 percent of their retiree health care obligations; these obligations are typically paid out of current tax revenues.\n\nScope Of Unfunded Retiree Health Care Obligations\n\nThe overall size of the OPEB liabilities of local governments is huge and rising rapidly. In 2009, the General Accounting Office estimated that these liabilities were more than $670 billion. A more recent and comprehensive estimate in the Journal of Health Economics estimated OPEB liabilities of local governments at close to $1 trillion dollars. However, the size of these OPEB liabilities varies widely among states and cities in the United States.\n\nAs shown by Chart I, New Jersey has the highest OPEB liabilities per capita of the states, at $7,206 per capita. On the other hand, Chart I shows that several states have low levels of OPEB liabilities per capita \u2014 with Idaho the lowest at $53 per capita. These states with low OPEB liabilities per capita have relatively weak public unions and relatively strong fiscal discipline.\n\nChart I\n\nSource: Standards & Poor\u2019s Rating Services \u201cU.S. State OPEB Liabilities Decline Slightly, But Continue To Vary Widely\u201d\n\nSimilarly, as shown by Chart II, there are tremendous differences in unfunded OPEBs among the 30 largest cities in the US. New York City leads the pack by both total amount of OPEB liabilities and OPEB liabilities per household \u2014 partly because its OPEB statistics include the retiree health care obligations to the City\u2019s teachers. Conversely, Denver, Minneapolis, and Tampa have kept their OPEB liabilities below $90 million in total amount and $620 per household.\n\nChart II\n\nSource: The Pew Charitable Trusts: American Cities\n\nIn states and cities with large OPEB liabilities, there is almost no advance funding, so these health care benefits are paid out of current tax revenues. As health care benefits grow, they compete for tax dollars with essential services like schools and police. Consider Chart III, which compares health care spending with property tax revenues in four Massachusetts cities. In all four cities, retiree health care spending and local property taxes increased substantially from 2009 to 2013; yet health care spending grew faster than property tax revenues so that such spending consumed a growing percentage of rising property taxes.\n\nChart III\n\nSource: Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation\n\nNew Legal Guidance From The US Supreme Court\n\nGiven the growing unfunded liabilities for retiree health care and their rising conflicts with other public spending priorities, many states and cities have recently tried to manage down these liabilities. However, local governments will face lawsuits by the unions representing public employees in response to any proposal to pare back benefits. In the pension arena, public unions have won almost all these suits because courts have held that most pension benefits are protected explicitly or implicitly by the state\u2019s constitution \u2014 which is almost impossible to change.\n\nBy contrast, the legal status of health care plans has been more subject to debate. State constitutions do not usually address protections for retiree health care plans. These plans are also exempt from the federal pension protections in ERISA, the federal law governing employee retirement benefits. Moreover, most retiree health care plans have minimal advance funding, so the beneficiaries of such plans are legally unsecured creditors of the relevant public entity. In Stockton, California, for instance, the judge approved the city\u2019s bankruptcy plan, which totally eliminated health care benefits of public retirees while preserving most of their accrued pension benefits.\n\nFor solvent local governments, the legal status of retiree health care plans is primarily determined by the collective bargaining agreement with the relevant union.\n\nEarlier this year the US Supreme Court announced principles of contract interpretation that will help local governments defeat court challenges to future reductions in retiree health care benefits. M&G Polymers vs. Tackett addressed a collective bargaining agreement that provided certain retirees with \u201ca full Company contribution\u201d of their health care benefits \u201cfor the duration of [the] Agreement.\u201d When the company asked retirees to start contributing some of their health care premiums, the union sued on the theory that the company had created a vested right in their employees to free lifetime health care.\n\nThe union prevailed in the Court of Appeals, which was reversed by a unanimous Supreme Court. Although the case took place in the private sector, the principles should generally apply to public sector agreements on retiree health care benefits.\n\nThe Supreme Court began by finding that the express language of the collective bargaining agreement was ambiguous on the question of how long health care benefits would be paid in full by the company. Given that ambiguity, the Supreme Court opined that judges should look for hard evidence of what the parties actually intended, rather than making their own inferences about contractual intent.\n\nThe Supreme Court went on to articulate two interpretive principles that will be especially relevant to collective bargaining agreements on health care benefits, which often are unclear on the duration of those benefits. The Supreme Court supported the \u201ctraditional principle that courts should not construe ambiguous writings to create lifetime promises.\u201d Instead, the Supreme Court endorsed the principle that \u201ccontractual obligations will cease, in the ordinary course, upon termination of the bargaining agreement.\u201d\n\nPotential Reforms To Retiree Health Care Plans\n\nWith this guidance from the Supreme Court, states and cities are likely to negotiate express modifications to their retiree health care plans as their collective bargaining contracts expire. It should be relatively easy to agree to premium contributions by retirees or less generous post-retiree benefits if these changes are applied only to newly hired public employees. However, such changes will take decades to have a material financial impact.\n\nOn the other hand, it will be politically difficult to reduce the health care benefit package of public employees who have already retired. They presumably stayed in their public jobs in part because they expected to receive certain health care benefits after retirement. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision would legally allow cities and states to renegotiate the health care package provided to already retired employees \u2014 unless the applicable collective bargaining agreement expressly extended that package for the life of such employees. Similarly, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision would legally allow cities and states to renegotiate the post-retirement health care package for current employees after the termination of the current collective bargaining agreement \u2014 unless the prior agreement expressly extended the duration of the package.\n\nIn these negotiations, local governments and their unions should discuss possible reforms, such as:\n\nLower limits on cost of living adjustments (COLAs), which sometimes exceed the inflation index. Partial payment of health care premiums by retirees, especially the premiums charged by Medicare. Stricter eligibility rules in terms of years of public employment to obtain full health care benefits. Required sign-up for health care coverage offered by a private employer if a retiree gets a job in the private sector. Co-payments and deductibles for prescription drugs and doctors\u2019 visits (except for preventive care). Narrower scope of medical services or separate charges for eye glasses and dental work.\n\nOf course, public employee unions will resist most of these changes, but they may be necessary for many local governments to avoid the \u201cCadillac\u201d tax beginning in 2018. This levy is a 40 percent excise tax on the annual costs of a health care plan above $10,200 for an individual and $27,500 for a family.\n\nAlthough precise cost figures are not readily available, many health care plans in the public sector will clearly have to pay the 40 percent Cadillac tax under their current trajectories. For example, the New York deputy mayor estimated that the Cadillac tax would cost his city $22 million in 2018 and $549 million in 2022. Similarly, the association providing a pooled health care plan to municipalities in Washington State estimated that the Cadillac tax could add $76 million in local taxes over the decade starting in 2018 \u2014 unless health care costs are constrained.\n\nIn short, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision will lead to the renegotiation of health care benefits at the expiration of the current collective bargaining agreement in most states and cities. In these negotiations, the threat of a Cadillac tax will lead local governments to propose health care plans with more employee contributions and less generous benefits. In response, public unions should not accept these proposals unless local governments commit to a binding schedule to advance fund the revised health care plans. Without assets backing these plans, public retirees have little assurance they will actually receive the promised healthcare benefits in the future.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/05/07/renegotiating-retiree-health-care-plans-after-new-supreme-court-guidance/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/Blog_Pozen.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Renegotiating Retiree Health Care Plans After New Supreme Court Guidance"}, "description": "Renegotiating Retiree Health Care Plans After New Supreme Court Guidance | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f8f\"", "article_summary": "The good news is that retiree health care plans can legally be revised more easily than pension plans.\nThese retiree health care plans are quite costly for local governments.\nAccordingly, a lower discount rate would mean higher unfunded liabilities for retiree health care plans.\nState constitutions do not usually address protections for retiree health care plans.\nMoreover, most retiree health care plans have minimal advance funding, so the beneficiaries of such plans are legally unsecured creditors of the relevant public entity."}
