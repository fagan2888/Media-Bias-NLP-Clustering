Man moves in next door to ex-wife, puts up a statue flipping her the bird

Talk about expert trolling. A Detroit man erected a huge statue flipping the bird and placed in his ex-wife’s line of sight, aiming it at her home next door.

The man, believed to be strip club mogul Alan Markovitz according to multiple reports, bought the home adjacent to his ex-wife in Oakland County, Mich. Upon moving in with his daughter Tiffany, Markovitz erected an expensive-looking bronze statue of a hand giving the middle finger on his back porch, Gawker reported.

The photo was first tweeted by a woman claiming to be the ex-wife’s daughter, Lenka Tuohy.

“How psychotic do you have to be to buy the house directly next to your ex wife and then put a statue up like that?!?! Real classy alan,” Tuohy wrote on Twitter on Nov. 11.

But Markovitz didn’t stop there. He made sure his ex-wife could always see the statue and installed a giant spotlight, making it visible at night, too.

Tuohy again took to Twitter, saying it was “hard for me to enjoy my baths now because my fav tub is in my moms bathroom which faces out towards tif and alans house:(”

According to Deadline Detroit, Tiffany is Markovitz’s daughter from a previous marriage. He met his now ex-wife, who is from Slovakia, at a birthday party, but she was cheating on him with someone Markovitz knew.

“He broke the Man Code. He’s a total freakin’ a**hole,” Markovitz told Deadline Detroit. “Real men don’t do that to another guy.”
