Thank you for allowing me to speak and talk to you about the ACA in the home state of President Obama\u2019s mother.\n\nOn March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. Since that time, a major political party and other groups have supported the efforts to eliminate the ACA over fifty times with little success, which is a waste of taxpayer money since the Supreme Court ruled the law is constitutional. Mr. Archer, I would like to ask you personally, whether your non-support of the ACA is racism or not? It appears that certain members of the Republican Party, such as Ben Carson, Alan West of Florida, Clarence Thomas and you provide cover for not accepting the ACA or any of President Obama\u2019s policies based on racial bias? Couldn\u2019t the energy expended be better spent on certain issues such a saving the Juan \u201cPoppy\u201d Abbott Center and not charging our youth a fee to attend the Center? I have a vested interest in saving the Center because the late Mayor Butch Felker and I dedicated the center, formerly known as Eastlawn Center, was renamed after well-known youth leader Juan \u201cPoppy\u201d Abbott\n\nYour reason for voting against two health agency employees attending a healthcare conference in Washington D.C. smells of bias. Although you are worried about $3400 being spent on job-related travel, apparently you had no problem with the government shut down which cost the country millions or billions of dollars and lost productivity; or when Kris Kobach travels to Arizona, Louisiana or Missouri to help those states pass voter suppression laws while being paid to do his duties as Secretary of the State of Kansas.\n\nBecause Kansas chose not to expand Medicaid, Kansas residents have fewer options for health coverage than people in states where Medicaid is growing. \u2018But millions of Americans who are currently without both a job and health coverage may find relief under Obamacare because new coverage options are now available through the health insurance marketplace serving Kansas\u2019.\n\nThank your for your time.\n\nI Challenge my Generation to Inspire Future Generations.\n\nYours in Christ, Sonny Scroggins", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Aly Van Dyke", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "The nearly 470 employees represented by Teamsters Local 696 on Thursday joined the ranks of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 3 and classified employees of Shawnee County. \r\nNone of these employees will receive a raise this year.", "title": "Shawnee County Teamsters receive no wage bump this year", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2014-04-10/shawnee-county-teamsters-receive-no-wage-bump-year", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/13255928.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "The nearly 470 employees represented by Teamsters Local 696 on Thursday joined the ranks of the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 3 and classified employees of Shawnee County.None of these employees will receive a raise this year.
