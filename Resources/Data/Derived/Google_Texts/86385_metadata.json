Private insurers, Medicaid and prescription benefit managers are often able to negotiate discounts in the range of 17 percent, the report noted.\n\nCongestive heart failure \u2014 a fluid buildup in the body \u2014 affects an estimated 6 million Americans. It can be caused by coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure or other conditions and has a five-year death rate similar to many cancers. Patients are often in and out of the hospital, leading to high health care costs.\n\nThe ICER analysts said the new pill \u2014 Entresto by Novartis \u2014 provides clear health benefits to patients and reduces hospitalization rates when compared with current standard treatments. Over the long-term, the group judged it as cost effective because of those advantages.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that ICER found Entresto to be cost effective,\u201d said Novartis spokeswoman Elizabeth Power. \u201cEntresto represents a major medical advance.\u201d\n\nFor the first five years, however, ICER estimated the drug\u2019s budget impact to be $17 billion, even including savings resulting from patients\u2019 improved health. That\u2019s more than the $904 million annual net cost that ICER sets as its threshold for sounding an alarm that a drug or medical treatment is too costly.\n\nAnother reason why it is cost effective over many years, but a budget-buster in the short term, is because so many people are expected to seek treatment in the initial years, said Pearson. An estimated 390,000 patients would receive the drug initially, growing to 1.9 million over 5 years.\n\n\u201cJust because it\u2019s a good long-term value doesn\u2019t mean you could afford it today without jacking up health care premiums a whole lot or doing other things to make money available,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ICER report said there is insufficient evidence to determine if the other treatment \u2013 the sensor called CardioMEMS by St. Jude Medical \u2014 provides a health benefit. The paper-clip sized device measures pressure in the pulmonary artery, sending the information wirelessly to the patient\u2019s doctor. It aims to reduce hospitalizations by giving patients and their doctors time to adjust medications or make other changes before a patient\u2019s condition requires hospitalization.\n\nSt. Jude spokeswoman Kate Stoltenberg said the company is \u201cconfident in the value and benefits demonstrated by the CardioMEMS HF System and are joined by many leading physicians \u2026 who believe that the technology is a significant breakthrough in the way heart failure patients are managed.\u201d\n\nThe ICER analysis of the new treatments comes amid growing interest in considering cost in evaluating effectiveness of medical treatments, fueled in part by last year\u2019s rollout of a hepatitis C drug that costs $1,000 a pill. ICER is among a handful of groups doing such work, which is often considered by health insurers in making coverage decisions for new treatments and negotiating prices with drug and device makers.\n\n\u201cThese issues around costs can become politicized, but we think America is mature enough to have a more open and honest discussion about price, and not just about drugs, but other parts of the health system,\u201d Pearson said. \u201cThis is a discussion that is long overdue.\u201d\n\nAfter seeking public comment, the draft report will be reviewed in October by a California commission of medical experts and then finalized.\n\nOn Tuesday in a separate report, the group said new injectable cholesterol drugs \u2014 priced at about $14,000 a year \u2014 were too high for the health benefits they might provide or the savings they might tally through reduced number of heart attacks and strokes. The cost of those drugs needs to drop by 85 percent to avoid straining state and federal health care budgets, the report concluded.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
