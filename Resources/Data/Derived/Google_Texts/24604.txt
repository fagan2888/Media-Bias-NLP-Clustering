HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - State police are investigating after a trooper shot at a suspected car thief in Hartford.

No one was struck by gunfire.

Police say the vehicle was reported stolen in Greenwich, and was tracked via the vehicle owner’s cellphone to Hartford at about 11 p.m. Wednesday.

As the car got off Interstate 84, troopers tried to stop it, but the driver rammed a police cruiser.

At that point, at least one trooper opened fire. The driver was arrested after crashing at Sigourney and Park streets.

Kevin Feliciano, of Hartford, was arrested. It’s not clear if he has a lawyer.

Two state troopers were treated and released from a hospital for minor injuries.

The shooting remains under investigation.
