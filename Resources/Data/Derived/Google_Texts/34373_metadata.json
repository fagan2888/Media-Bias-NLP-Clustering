The 19-16 vote in the Senate on Tuesday was similarly partisan.\n\nThe main provision of L.D. 1428, sponsored by Sen. David Burns, R-Whiting, was that no state law could infringe on a person\u2019s exercise of religion unless that law constituted a \u201ccompelling state interest.\u201d\n\nBurns said his bill, modeled after similar legislation passed in 18 states, would bring Maine closer to the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed in 1993 by President Bill Clinton. That law followed a Supreme Court case that some felt unraveled religious protections outlined in the First Amendment.\n\n\u201cFreedom of religion is the basis this country was founded on,\u201d said Rep. Michael McClellan, R-Raymond, during House debate on the bill Thursday. \u201cPeople say we (already) have the protection. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nOpponents said the bill was unnecessary and would almost certainly lead to a flood of legal cases from people claiming that a rule or law infringed on their ability to worship. Some Democrats said the bill was a direct response to Maine\u2019s same-sex marriage law because it would give wedding vendors a legal basis for refusing to do business with gay couples.\n\nRep. Andrew McLean, D-Gorham, who married his partner last summer, said the bill would undermine protections outlined in Maine\u2019s Human Rights Act. \u201cIt would give the ability to discriminate against anyone if it violates their religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nOther critics said the bill would negate a provision in the federal Affordable Care Act that requires insurance companies to cover contraception.\n\nThe bill had support from several religious groups, including the Christian Civic League of Maine, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portland and the Maine Right to Life Committee.\n\nMany other groups opposed the bill, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, EqualityMaine, the Maine Medical Association and the Maine Women\u2019s Lobby.\n\nAssistant House Minority Leader Alex Willette, R-Mapleton, said opponents had it wrong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a straightforward bill. It does not create any new rights. It does not allow religious people to get away with anything they want,\u201d Willette said. \u201cOpponents have muddied the discussion of this bill \u2026 with hypotheticals.\u201d\n\nRep. Justin Chenette, D-Saco, who is gay, said the bill offended him. \u201cIt makes me feel like a second-class citizen,\u201d he said.\n\nEric Russell can be contacted at 791-6344 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @PPHEricRussell", "article_metadata": {"description": "The bill sought to affirm constitutional protection for the right to worship, but opponents say it was unneeded and would open the door to legal discrimination.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The bill sought to affirm constitutional protection for the right to worship, but opponents say it was unneeded and would open the door to legal discrimination.", "title": "Maine House follows Senate in rejecting \u2018religious freedom\u2019 bill - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/02/20/maine_house_follows_senate_in_rejecting__religious_freedom__bill_/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The bill sought to affirm constitutional protection for the right to worship, but opponents say it was unneeded and would open the door to legal discrimination.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PHnewFBlogo.png", "title": "Maine House follows Senate in rejecting \u2018religious freedom\u2019 bill - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2014-02-20T13:52:34-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe5e\"", "article_summary": "Many other groups opposed the bill, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, EqualityMaine, the Maine Medical Association and the Maine Women\u2019s Lobby.\nRep.
