Tripathi\u2019s vision of the future is informed by years of experience at the helm of one of the most successful collaboratives of its kind in the U.S., and he shared his insights on the swirl of ongoing developments around HIE without hesitation. Below are excerpts from that interview.\n\nWhat is your opinion of the letter to Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, signed by CHIME and 47 other healthcare associations?\n\n[On Feb. 24, leaders at the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based College of Healthcare Information Management Executives (CHIME) and 47 other healthcare associations co-signed a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, calling for \u201cadditional time and flexibility in the meaningful use program to ensure its continued success.\u201d] I think that effort really reflects that there are too many things hitting the industry at once. I think it\u2019s a good thing to give people the flexibility they need. The reality is that none of us could have predicted that you\u2019d have meaningful use Stage 2, ICD-10, OCR [HIPAA data security audits under the auspices of the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services], the ACA [Affordable Care Act], all at once. And it\u2019s pretty miserable being a hospital CIO right now\u2014it\u2019s not a fun job! You have a lot of risk and a lot of exposure, and a whole range of issues, like BYOD.\n\nIs this an unprecedented time for CIOs and other healthcare IT leaders?\n\nAbsolutely; it\u2019s completely unprecedented. And their importance is rising, in terms of how important IT is. Everyone\u2019s expecting innovation going forward, in terms of new reimbursement and care management models, and yet CIOs are saying, I can only handle compliance right now. And ICD-10 being pushed out for a year is now a huge issue. We\u2019re helping to lead collaborative ICD-10 testing in Massachusetts, and it\u2019s turning out to be extremely time-consuming.\n\nPeople are saying these days that, fundamentally, health information exchange is just too difficult. What is your reaction to that sentiment?\n\nIf one wants it to be rational and a hierarchical learning structure, in which everyone learns in a direct way\u2014yes, in that sense, it\u2019s too hard. But where else has that ever happened in the U.S.? We\u2019re an incredibly large, heterogeneous country. To me, HIE is flourishing; but it\u2019s flourishing in different ways than we expected\u2014in a sort of bottom-up way. One way in which it\u2019s flourishing is in terms of demand in relation to supply. It\u2019s very hard to go to a hospital that isn\u2019t thinking about this very hard or isn\u2019t already embarked on something. Everyone\u2019s thinking about it.\n\nAnd on the supply side, there are lots of technologies, very tactical technologies, that people are leveraging, to create HIEs. And people aren\u2019t expecting to simply plug in an established model. And most of the HIE 1.0 HIEs failed\u2014and the ones that survived\u2014Indiana, Cincinnati, and New York\u2014those that survived from that 1.0 generation, those are not replicable.\n\nSo the newer ones are moving forward in replicable ways?\n\nI think so, yes, but each is unique. And Baystate Medical Center has formed a private HIE, and in a year, it\u2019s already up and running, and there\u2019s good anticipation. But it\u2019s very, very focused, very tactical; and they\u2019re not trying to solve the world\u2019s problems; and it\u2019s their own private money. Emerson Hospital, and Anna Jacques Hospital, they\u2019re all doing the same thing, in different ways, attuned to their specific needs.\n\nSo uniqueness of approach is OK in HIE development, then?\n\nAbsolutely. In the same way that uniqueness is OK in any kind of fragmented industry. And in terms of auto companies and retailers and airlines\u2014consolidation eventually happened. It\u2019s unclear where that driving force will come into healthcare, because you start out with incredible fragmentation on both the demand and supply sides.\n\nIt almost has to be Medicare driving development, in other words?\n\nYes, and up until now, it\u2019s been incredibly fragmented on both sides; but Medicare and Medicaid are just the biggest entities, and so they\u2019re able to move the market. But the nature of physician practice and the ambulatory setting is going to mean the supply side will remain fragmented.\n\nNow that physicians are consolidating into hospital organizations and large medical groups, will that change the landscape of HIE development?\n\nYes, I think so. HIE is flourishing, but in silos. I think it was a bad expectation to assume that once HIEs were created, all the barriers would immediately fall. Well, that didn\u2019t take into account business realities. So we\u2019re seeing a lot of investment in silos like integrated health systems and ACOs\u2014and I don\u2019t see that as a bad thing. Accountable care organizations are making investments based on sharing risk.\n\nThere was this kind of idealized notion of what HIE would do, then?", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc985c\"", "article_summary": "To me, HIE is flourishing; but it\u2019s flourishing in different ways than we expected\u2014in a sort of bottom-up way.\nPeople are saying these days that, fundamentally, health information exchange is just too difficult.\nOne way in which it\u2019s flourishing is in terms of demand in relation to supply.\nSo we\u2019re seeing a lot of investment in silos like integrated health systems and ACOs\u2014and I don\u2019t see that as a bad thing.\nEmerson Hospital, and Anna Jacques Hospital, they\u2019re all doing the same thing, in different ways, attuned to their specific needs."}
