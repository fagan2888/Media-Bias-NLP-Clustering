This update reflects a hospital market basket increase of 2.9 percent, which is offset by two Affordable Care Act (ACA) provisions: a 0.2 percent reduction and a 0.5 percent \u201cmulti-factor productivity\u201d (MFP) adjustment. The update for individual procedures can vary, and hospitals that do not meet Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) Program requirements are subject to a 2.0 percent reduction.

CMS projects a 2.3 percent increase in total OPPS payments (about $900 million) for 2015, considering all policies in the rule. CMS is adopting its proposal to conditionally package ancillary services when they are integral, ancillary, supportive, dependent, or adjunctive to a primary service (except for preventive, psychiatry, and drug administration services). These ancillary services will be paid separately when they are furnished by themselves. In 2015, packaged ancillary services are limited to services assigned to Ambulatory Payment Classifications (APCs) with a geometric mean cost of $100 or less (prior to applying the conditional packaging status indicator). CMS expects to expand this policy in the future. CMS also will package prosthetic supplies payment in 2015.\n\nwhen they are integral, ancillary, supportive, dependent, or adjunctive to a primary service (except for preventive, psychiatry, and drug administration services).

The final rule implements, with revisions, a policy discussed in the final 2014 rule to replace device-dependent APCs with comprehensive APCs (or \u201cC-APCs\u201d) in CY 2015 . CMS will make a single payment for all related or adjunctive hospital services provided to a patient in the furnishing of certain device dependent services, with certain exceptions. The C-APC payment will include: all outpatient services, including diagnostic procedures, laboratory and other diagnostic tests, and treatments that assist in the delivery of the primary procedure; visits and evaluations performed in association with the procedure; services and supplies used during the service; outpatient department services delivered by therapists as part of the comprehensive service; durable medical equipment (DME), as well as prosthetic and orthotic items and supplies when provided as part of the outpatient service; and other outpatient components provided during the comprehensive service (with limited exceptions, such as mammography and ambulance services, brachytherapy seeds, and pass-through drugs and devices). CMS is establishing 25 C-APCs for 2015, which are assigned to one of 12 clinical families.\n\n.
