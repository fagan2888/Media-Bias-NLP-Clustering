Labs showed a white blood cell count that was 12 times normal and profound anemia, and he was driven by ambulance to our hospital.\n\nHis white beard made him look much older than his 50 years. His overalls, and the plain dress and bonnet worn by his wife sitting by his side, were incongruous with the starched white of his bedsheets and the crisp, official-sounding blips coming from the machine monitoring his vital signs. He lay comfortably, hands clasped in his lap.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, though I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s under these circumstances,\u201d I said as I shook his hand, his grip much stronger than mine.\n\nWe already had confirmation of his leukemia from a test, flow cytometry, that we had performed on his blood. I told him this and started a discussion about treatment options.\n\n\u201cGiven your young age and good health, I recommend we treat your leukemia with intensive chemotherapy, which we give here in the hospital. You would need to remain here, though, for four to six weeks.\u201d He absorbed this information, and I could see him consider the effect this would have on his business and his ability to provide for his family.\n\n\u201cWell, let me ask you a question,\u201d he said, his voice both serious and philosophical. \u201cWhat if I chose to leave the hospital without treatment and go back home.\u201d\n\nHis leukemia was particularly aggressive and had already started to affect his organs. He also had a fever. I told him there was a good chance he would die in the next few days if he left.\n\n\u201cWhat is your reticence in being treated?\u201d I asked.\n\nHe set his jaw. \u201cI\u2019ve seen too many folks spend their remaining time getting chemotherapy only to die anyway. I\u2019ll not go through this if it means just a few more months to live.\u201d He looked squarely at me. \u201cThis world is not my final destiny, anyway.\u201d\n\nI explained that sometimes the leukemia was curable, and the number of chemotherapy courses finite, but acknowledged that he was right, with bad leukemias like his, treatment could be futile. Something else seemed to be troubling him.\n\n\u201cAre you worried at all about the cost to your community of a hospital stay?\u201d I asked. Many Amish do not carry private insurance, but pay for a member\u2019s catastrophic illness by pooling their resources.\n\nFor the first time, his wife spoke. \u201cI think that\u2019s part of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a deacon, and see the hospital bills that come through,\u201d he said. \u201c It just doesn\u2019t seem worth the cost.\u201d\n\nHe made up his mind and left the hospital soon after. We cobbled together the best plan we could for him to be cared for as an outpatient, with a doctor I trusted in nearby Wooster, Ohio.\n\nLater that day, I visited an 80-year-old woman with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome in the intensive care unit. As a result of her disease, her platelets were very low, and she had suffered a subdural hematoma, a bleed into her head. In contrast to the quiet of the leukemia floor, the I.C.U. was cacophonous with blaring machines and people talking loudly to be heard over them.\n\nI had met her weeks before at a patient conference and recalled that she and her family had emigrated from the United Kingdom. She had asked intelligent questions and set clear goals of how to manage her disease. I admired her focus.\n\nWhen I walked into her room though, she was a fragment of the woman I remembered. One eye was closed, one open; half of her face animate, half slack. I greeted her and held her hand, but she didn\u2019t respond. Her husband, son and daughter were in the room and motioned for me to step out with them. Her son, who was a doctor, spoke.\n\n\u201cThe neurosurgeon came by and recommended putting a burr hole in her skull, to relieve the pressure. The professional side of me wants to try it, but I think I\u2019m outnumbered.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe would never want that,\u201d her husband said. \u201cShe\u2019s lived to be 80 years old, and her time has come. Enough is enough.\u201d His voice cracked. \u201cI\u2019m lucky to have had the 58 years with her that I did.\u201d\n\nHe started sobbing, and his daughter hugged him tight, comforting him. \u201cCan we just move her someplace quiet, away from all this?\u201d she asked.\n\nWe transferred her to a palliative medicine floor, and she died within hours.\n\nAs the Affordable Care Act is being put in place, we hear a lot of debate on how best to control spiraling health care costs. We should pause to consider that a critical component to true health care reform is in changing our core expectations about the use of heroic measures at the end of life and whether to treat illnesses that are likely incurable. In this respect, sometimes it\u2019s our patients who can teach us the most.\n\nPhoto\n\n\n\nDr. Mikkael Sekeres is director of the leukemia program at the Cleveland Clinic.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131107131316, "BN": "well", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "health/well", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/well/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 7, 2013", "keywords": "Doctors,Hospitals,Medicine and Health,Doctors,Featured", "GBLC": "Doctors;Featured", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/well/What Our Patients Can Teach Us ( 20131107 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Mikkael A.
