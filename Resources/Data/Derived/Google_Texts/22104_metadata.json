Ron Johnson said that someone began throwing rocks and other objects, prompting police to deploy tear gas, but no arrests were made. Molotov cocktails hit a liquor store causing it to catch fire, HuffPost's Christine Conetta reported from the scene.\n\nPolice in riot gear were present, but never left the corner of Florissant Ave and Ferguson Ave., despite stores being looted just feet away. From midnight to 4:00 a.m., community members were left to self-police, Conetta observed, with several people trying to prevent looters from continuing to take items from stores.\n\nAll of a sudden, tempers flared again when a large group of protestors confronted officers in front of a liquor store pic.twitter.com/QBMiWdqYqU \u2014 Joel D.

Brown's friend who was with him that night, Dorian Johnson, said that the officer attacked Brown, then shot at the 18-year-old as he was trying to get away. Ferguson Police claim that Brown attacked the officer, and said Wednesday that the officer involved in the altercation was injured. Multiple witnesses have said that they saw Brown with his hands up in the air when he was shot.\n\nPolice released footage on Friday that they said showed Brown robbing a convenience store for cigarillos. Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, was not aware that he was a suspect in a robbery at the time of the shooting. The family's attorney accused police of trying to \"assassinate the character of Michael Brown\" to divert attention from his death.\n\nFor the latest updates, follow The Huffington Post's Ryan J.
