Sunday afternoon.

Gracie Plymire, 9, played football with her father in front of QDoba. Sarah and Lane Slabaugh took their children, Slyvie, 1, and Zander, 3, for a stroll.\n\n\"We live in the neighborhood and we thought it'd be fun for (Zander) to see Bardstown Road not so busy,\" Lane Slabaugh said. \"He knows he normally has to get off his bike when we get to Bardstown Road, so this is a pretty big deal for him.\"\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Bardstown Road shop owners say CycLOUvia is not only a fun family event, but it allows visitors to slow down and get a look at what's available in that community.
