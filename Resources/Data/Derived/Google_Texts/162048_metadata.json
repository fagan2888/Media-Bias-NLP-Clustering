The committee in a statement said the matter needed further review; it gave no time frame for completion.\n\nGrayson has denied any wrongdoing. In a statement Tuesday, his campaign called the ethics probe a \u201cpolitical witch hunt.\u201d\n\nThe extension means the issue will still hover over a race that is seen as key to Democrats\u2019 bid to wrest control of the Senate from Republicans in November\u2019s elections. The primary is in August.\n\nThe New York Times reported in February that emails and the fund\u2019s marketing documents showed Grayson had promoted his international travels, some with congressional delegations, to solicit business for the fund, in possible violation of House ethics rules.\n\n\u201cThe larger picture here is that the Washington political establishment has decided who their favored candidate is, and it\u2019s not Rep. Grayson,\u201d the statement from Grayson\u2019s campaign said.\n\nTop Democrats have tried to get Grayson to drop out of the Florida Senate race because of the questions about the hedge fund, throwing their support to Democratic opponent Representative Patrick Murphy. President Barack Obama has endorsed Murphy, and Vice President Joe Biden has campaigned with Murphy.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said earlier this year that Grayson\u2019s actions had disgraced Congress and that he should leave the Senate race immediately.\n\nBut Grayson has been endorsed by some grassroots liberal groups who appreciate his outspokenness. One of his more famous lines, delivered during the Obamacare debate in 2009, was that the Republican health-care plan for America amounted to \u201cdon\u2019t get sick,\u201d and if you do, \u201cdie quickly.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported that Grayson had created the hedge fund in 2011 after losing a race for re-election to Congress, and kept it open after he was re-elected in 2012.\n\nAccording to filings with the Securities and Exchange, the fund had been called the Grayson Fund, but Grayson changed the name to Sibylline Fund LP. The Times reported the fund had closed branches previously located in the Cayman Islands.\n\nRubio, who recently ended a campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, leaves the Senate after this year after just one term. Republicans seeking the seat include Representatives Ron DeSantis and David Jolly. \u2014 Reuters", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.128x79":
