(TheBlaze/AP) \u2014 Health insurance companies in California may not refuse to cover the cost of abortions, state insurance officials have ruled, reversing a policy stemming from the decision by two Catholic universities to drop elective abortions from their employee health plans.\n\nAlthough the federal Affordable Care Act does not compel employers to provide workers with health insurance that includes abortion coverage, the director of California\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care said in a letter to seven insurance companies on Friday that the state Constitution and a 1975 state law prohibits them from selling group plans that exclude the procedure. The law in question requires such plans to encompass all \u201cmedically necessary\u201d care.\n\n\u201cAbortion is a basic health care service,\u201d department director Michelle Rouillard wrote in the letter. \u201cAll health plans must treat maternity services and legal abortion neutrally.\u201d\n\nJesuit-run Santa Clara University and Loyola Marymount University notified employees last fall that they planned to stop paying for elective abortions, but said faculty and staff members could pay for supplemental coverage that would be provided through a third party. The two schools said their insurers, Anthem Blue Cross and Kaiser Permanente, had cleared the move with the state.\n\nUniversity employees who objected to the decision and abortion-rights groups lobbied the women\u2019 caucus of the California Legislature, which in turn asked Gov. Jerry Brown to clarify and reverse the health care department\u2019s determination.\n\nIn her letter to the insurers, Roullaird said her department had \u201cerroneously approved or did not object\u201d to a small number of health insurance policies that excluded abortions. She asked the companies to review their plans, including any the department had already approved, to make sure they are in accordance with the new guidance.\n\nThe two insurance companies told the San Jose Mercury News that they would comply with the directive. Loyola and Santa Clara representatives said they would explore their options with Anthem Blue Cross and Kaiser Permanente.\n\nTwo groups that oppose abortion, the Life Legal Defense Foundation and Alliance Defending Freedom, sent a letter to Rouillard on Friday saying that under federal law California cannot force employers to cover elective abortions. The groups said they would file a civil rights complaint with the federal government unless the state\u2019s previous determination was reinstated.\n\n\u201cPro-life employers have the freedom to choose health insurance plans that do not conflict with their beliefs on the dignity of human life,\u201d Life Legal Defense Foundation Legal Director Catherine Short said. \u201cCalifornia cannot be allowed to discriminate against health plans that don\u2019t cover elective abortions and force people to purchase coverage that conflicts with their convictions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "SACRAMENTO, Calif.\u00a0(TheBlaze/AP) \u2014 Health insurance companies in California may not refuse to cover the cost of abortions, state insurance officials have ruled, reversing a policy stemming from the decision by two Catholic universities to drop elective abortions from their employee health plans.
