PRESIDENT?\n\nPresident Obama has made clear -- repeatedly and from the outset -- that the military strikes he has ordered in Iraq will be limited, shall set no precedent for future humanitarian actions and would not be the prelude to any larger American effort to defeat the Islamist army that controls the northwestern portion of that country. These are understandable strictures given Obama's disastrous experience with intervention and regime change in Libya as well as the attitudes of his political base. The ongoing Libya debacle and the recollections of the Iraq war make it hard for Obama to argue for more robust activity, not to mention that Obama himself was a chief author of Iraq's post U.S. occupation story. But today, more boots are on the ground in Iraq and military planners are looking into an ambitious rescue effort for trapped civilians.\n\n\n\n[Fox News contributor Kirsten Powers weighs in on President Obama\u2019s inattention to Iraqi Christians.]\n\n\n\nBack and forth - This seesawing approach is a product of the president\u2019s political and/or philosophical considerations. The principles make it hard for the mission to succeed and while the U.S. waits for Western or Arab allies to join the effort, the people Obama aims to help are dying and the U.S. looks impotent in the face of a motley Islamist army. So, Obama is now sending more troops in hopes of attaining the limited goals he set. It answers Hillary Clinton and other hawks who are pressuring the president to do more. But a few hundred more \u201cadvisors\u201d will not satisfy Hillary & Co. Meantime, the president\u2019s dribbling escalation antagonizes his supporters who are watching the man who continually takes credit for leaving Iraq drawn further in. Under similar pressure, Obama crawfished his way into two surges in Afghanistan and the results have been dire for all involved.\n\n\n\nHILLARY ON SYRIA SMACK TALK: SORRY, NOT SORRY\n\nHow do you know when a politician is not sorry? One strong sign is if she puts out a press release calling attention to the underlying offense. Democratic 2016 frontrunner Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign released a statement saying that she had called President Obama on Tuesday to explain that when she said his slogan for foreign policy was unworthy of a great nation and \u201cnot an organizing principle\u201d and blamed his inaction in Syria for the continued unraveling of the region it was not an attempt to \u201cattack him, his policies, or his leadership.\u201d That\u2019s true in the sense that it was not \u201can attempt\u201d but rather a successful gambit. There was pointedly no apology mentioned. Real political contrition means letting the other person publicize the call if they choose to at all. This looks more like a campaign stunt aimed at highlighting her differences with Obama\u2019s unpopular policies. Adding extra insult, Hillary\u2019s spokesman used bro-talk and said the two would be \u201chugging it out\u201d when they meet tonight at a huge Martha\u2019s Vineyard bash hosted by one their party\u2019s preeminent influence peddlers. Publicly criticizing your former boss, the sitting president, during multiple foreign policy crises is not a hug-it-out kind of moment. In an interview on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d Obama\u2019s national security spokesman, Ben Rhodes, was measured in his response to Hillary\u2019s effrontery. But you can be sure that Team Obama will not let this go unpunished.\n\n\n\n[A little lobbying between friends never hurt anybody, right? \u2013 While the president is celebrating tonight with the super-lobbyist set he might want to bring some employment applications. His administration has now dropped it\u2019s much ballyhooed restrictions on employing lobbyists.]\n\n\n\nBut she sure made a convincing case against it - Daily Caller: \u201cHillary Clinton now says she was a strong advocate of arming the Syrian rebels when she was secretary of state, but in a February 2012 interview, she passionately pushed back against the viability of such an opposition \u2013 even raising the specter that such a policy might be akin to supporting al-Qaida. \u2018What are we going to arm them with and against what?\u2019 she said, when pressed in a CBS interview about why the Obama administration wasn\u2019t giving the Syrian rebels weapons to help them in their fight against Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad\u2026 \u2018We know that al-Qaida [leader Ayman al Zawahiri ]is supporting the opposition in Syria. Are we supporting al-Qaida in Syria? Hamas is now supporting the opposition. Are we supporting Hamas in Syria?\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\n\n\nDEMS DISAGREE ON OBAMA\u2019S IMMIGRATION ACTIONS\n\nNew York Magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait, warned liberals that President Obama\u2019s threatened action to legalize millions of illegal immigrants, while lawful, would set a precedent for executive authority that would be hard to ever undo. \u201cTo think that the cycle will end here, and that a future president won\u2019t claim more expansive and disturbing powers to selectively enforce the law, requires an optimism not borne out by history. In the short run, we will rejoice in the sudden deliverance of massive humanitarian relief to people who have done nothing more than try to create a better life for their families. In the long run, we may look back on it with regret.\u201d But, not to worry says The New Republic\u2019s Brian Beutler who argues that Obama\u2019s unilateral action is okay because amnesty is inevitable. \u201cCongress is very likely one to three years away from passing a law that will give permanent protection to this same class of people. But it isn't quite there yet. Under the circumstances, Obama's move wouldn't just constitute a judicious allocation of resources, but an eminently humane reprieve for the hundreds or thousands of unlucky duckies\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\n[Go for it! - HuffPo reports on how a Democrat political group is pushing a legal case for sweeping action on immigration by citing instances when past presidents have given limited reprieves to selected groups of immigrants.]\n\n\n\n310,000 set to lose ObamaCare coverage for immigration status - WSJ: \u201cThe Obama administration moved Tuesday to cut off health insurance for up to 310,000 people who signed up through the HealthCare.gov system unless they can provide documents in the next few weeks showing they are U.S. citizens or legal residents.\u201d\n\n\n\n[National Journal examines how recent legal challenges could give more power to governors in the implementation of ObamaCare.]\n\n\n\nCut them loose - Fox News: \u201cMore than 600 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions were released by federal authorities in early 2013 in advance of the \u2018sequester\u2019 budget cuts\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nOBAMA GIVES SUCCESSORS SOMETHING TO SHOOT FOR\n\nWashington Examiner Executive Editor Mark Tapscott is not at all impressed with White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest\u2019s response to criticism of an administration-wide crackdown on reporting and limitations on media access. Earnest said that President Obama \u201chas set an historically high standard of transparency that is part of the legacy to which future presidents will aspire ...\u201d\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: Now, Mark, there may be broad agreement that the new standard is not \u201chistorically high,\u201d but surely you\u2019d allow that future presidents will aspire to it, and no doubt surpass it!]\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nWhy do The Proclaimers keep a spot on your \u201c25 Most Played\u201d and how come you still remember all the words to \u201cThe Humpty Dance\u201d even though you\u2019d never admit it? Research continues to show it is the music that we grew up with that we seem to love the most. Slate\u2019s Mark Joseph Stern explains why: \u201cBetween the ages of 12 and 22, our brains undergo rapid neurological development\u2014and the music we love during that decade seems to get wired into our lobes for good. When we make neural connections to a song, we also create a strong memory trace that becomes laden with heightened emotion, thanks partly to a surfeit of pubertal growth hormones. These hormones tell our brains that everything is incredibly important\u2014especially the songs that form the soundtrack to our teenage dreams (and embarrassments).\u201d\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Mark Udall, D-Colo., for trying to hide ObamaCare rate increases in the Centennial State. From the ad: \u201c335,000 Coloradans received a cancellation notice. What did Mark Udall do? He tried to hide it...Tell Sen. Udall, stop covering up for ObamaCare, Coloradans deserve the truth.\u201d The spot comes on the heels of a new ad from GOP nominee Rep. Cory Gardner on Tuesday that also hits Udall on the cancellations, including the one for Gardner\u2019s own family.\n\n\n\nLANDRIEU CAMPAIGN COULD FACE CIVIL FINES OVER TAXPAYER FUNDED FLIGHT\n\nSen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., caught a flight home with President Obama last November, despite not appearing with him at his New Orleans event. But Chris Frates found Landrieu used $3,000 of taxpayer money towards a charter flight to a campaign fundraiser that same day. According to a statement from Landrieu\u2019s campaign spokesman Fabien Levy the charter company mistakenly billed Landrieu\u2019s senate office and the campaign noticed the error a few weeks ago. The Senate office has received a refund from the company and the campaign has paid the bill Aug. 4. Despite this, the campaign still violated federal law and could face civil fines as a result.\n\n\n\nNUNN LAUNCHES FIRST ATTACK\n\nGeorgia Democratic Senate candidate Michelle Nunn has fired off her first attack ad against Republican David Perdue. In the ad a narrator touts Nunn\u2019s work as head as the volunteer organization Points of Light while claiming \u201cPerdue\u2019s company closed plants and moved jobs to China . David Perdue: His world doesn\u2019t include you.\u201d Perdue\u2019s campaign manager, Derrick Dickey, responded to the ad in stating, \u201cInstead of debating the issues that matter to Georgians, she is recycling old attacks against David that have already been dismissed. We expected no less from the hand-picked candidate of Barack Obama and Harry Reid.\u201d\n\n\n\n[The NRSC has launched its first independent expenditure ad against Nunn blasting her for being \u201ca rubber stamp for Obama\u2019s liberal values\u201d and her support of ObamaCare.]\n\n\n\nGOP GIVES LAND A HAND\n\nAs Democrats and liberal outside groups seek to give a boost to Rep. Gary Peters, D-Mich., in his battle against Republican Terri Lynn Land for the seat of retiring Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the National Republican Senatorial Committee is hitting the airwaves with a $1.5 million ad buy. Conservative political action group Freedom Partners has cancelled $1 million in advertising leading up to the November midterms after Dems honed in on its backers, industrialists Charles and David Koch. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has plumped $5 million towards advertising for Michigan this fall.\n\n\n\nSHAHEEN TAKES HEAT FOR J STREET SUPPORT\n\nN.H. Journal: \u201c[The New Hampshire Republican Party is calling on] Sen. Jeanne Shaheen [D-N.H.] and Reps. Carol Shea-Porter [D-N.H.] and Ann Kuster [D-N.H.] to return thousands of dollars in contributions received from a liberal, self-described pro-Israeli advocacy group and political action committee that has been labeled \u2018radical\u2019 by conservatives and \u2018well-respected\u2019 by a top state Democrat. According to OpenSecrets.org, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen has received $4,300 from the J Street PAC in the current election cycle, while Rep. Ann Kuster has received nearly $30,000 and Rep. Carol Shea-Porter has received more than $11,000\u2026 Party [spokeswoman] Lauren Zelt added, \u2018It\u2019s disgraceful that every Democrat member of the New Hampshire congressional delegation has accepted money from a radical fringe group that is attacking Israel.

He was joined during a press conference at a Kentucky State Police crime lab in Louisville by anti-rape activist Debbie Smith, of Virginia, for whom legislation that sends millions of dollars annually to states to reduce that backlog, was named.
