Tom Saviello (R-Franklin), the sponsor of the latest expansion proposal, says there is more urgency to expand Medicaid now because the money is needed to help fight the opiate addiction epidemic. On Tuesday morning, Saviello held a press conference with Farmington Police Chief Jack Peck, Franklin County Sheriff Scott Nichols and Sagadahoc County Sheriff Joel Merry, who said that many Mainers with drug addictions are unable to access treatment because they are uninsured. In addition to the Maine Police Chiefs Association and the Maine Sheriff\u2019s Association, Medicaid expansion is also supported by the Maine Hospital Association and the Maine Medical Association.\n\n\n\n\u201cI see the poverty that\u2019s in my district,\u201d Saviello told the HHS Committee. \u201cI see the people struggling to get by. Do they ever complain? No, I will tell you they do not. So if I can make their lives better, which I believe this bill will do, I\u2019m going to do it. It\u2019s just the right thing to do.\u201d\n\n\n\nUnder Saviello\u2019s proposal, LD 633, people below 100 percent of the federal poverty level ($15,930 per year for a family of two) would be able to access MaineCare, while people between 101 percent and 138 percent of the federal poverty level would be able to buy heavily subsidized private insurance. All MaineCare recipients would be required to pay premiums and co-payments as well. Saviello said the bill will alllow jails and prisons to use federal funds for substance abuse and mental health treatment, which will provide savings to the state. The bill would also require the Legislature to reevaluate Medicaid expansion every year to ensure that there are savings. LD 633 marks the sixth time legislators have pushed for Medicaid expansion; LePage has vetoed it each time.\n\n\n\nRepublicans on the committee voted straight party line against the bill. Rep. Deb Sanderson (R-Chelsea) expressed doubt that providing health care coverage to low-income Mainers would do much to solve the drug crisis because, she said, a lot of people have also died from drug overdoses in Medicaid expansion states like Massachusetts and New Hampshire. She said low-income uninsured people can use hospital charity care if they can\u2019t afford health insurance.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want folks to look at using a crisis as a reason to throw this state and this program into a fiscal tsunami,\u201d said Sanderson.\n\n\n\nMaine Health and Human Services Commissioner Mary Mayhew said that LePage will certainly veto Medicaid expansion yet again and told WVOM radio on Tuesday that if Maine expands health care to poor people the state will be thrown into \u201cfinancial chaos,\u201d just like \u201cCalifornia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Connecticut [and] Vermont.\u201d\n\n\n\nSaviello\u2019s bill will now go to the Maine Senate for a vote.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, the Legislature\u2019s Health and Human Services Committee voted 6-6 on a bill to expand MaineCare, the state\u2019s Medicaid insurance program, to 70,000 low-income Mainers. Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government will pay 90 percent of health care costs for individuals who are below 138 percent of the federal poverty level ($27,724 for a family of three). However a Supreme Court decision made Medicaid expansion optional for states. Maine is currently one of 19 states in the country, mostly in the South and out West, that have not expanded Medicaid, due to opposition from Gov. LePage and most of Maine\u2019s Republican lawmakers.Sen.
