(Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta, AP)\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The future of same-sex marriage and President Obama's health care law hang in the balance as the Supreme Court's 2014 term draws rapidly to a close this month. But those aren't the only big issues on the justices' plate.\n\nFair elections, racial discrimination, clean air, capital punishment: All await rulings over the next two weeks as the court completes action on 11 cases remaining this term. The next decisions will come Monday morning.\n\nWith major cases on license plates and religious signs decided Thursday along with four others, here are six big opinions still worth watching:\n\n\u2022 Same-sex marriage. In a decision likely to come on the term's last day \u2014 possibly June 29 or 30 \u2014 the court will decide whether gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to marry or whether state bans against same-sex marriage can remain in place.\n\nSix separate cases from Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee and Kentucky have been consolidated for the court's consideration. In them, 32 plaintiffs are asking for the right to marry or to have marriages licensed elsewhere recognized in their home states. Most legal experts predict the court, led by Justice Anthony Kennedy, will rule in favor of the gay and lesbian couples.\n\n\u2022 Obamacare. The future of President Obama's health care law is on the line for the second time in three years, and it's anyone's guess how the court will rule.\n\nPassed in 2010 and narrowly upheld by the court in a 5-4 ruling in 2012, the law has extended health insurance to 12 million Americans. But four words in its lengthy text \u2014 \"established by the state\" \u2014 now endanger federal subsidies relied upon by 6.4 million participants in 34 states that did not create their own exchanges or marketplaces. The justices must decide whether the law prohibits that financial aid.\n\n\u2022 Clean air. Environmental regulations approved by the Obama administration regularly come before the Supreme Court, and this year is no exception. A major rule requiring coal- and oil-fired power plants to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic air pollutants hangs in the balance.\n\nThe justices appeared closely divided on the central issue in the case \u2014 whether the Environmental Protection Agency should have considered the nearly $10 billion annual cost in relation to the potential benefits before approving the regulation \u2014 when it was argued. A decision in favor of objecting states and utilities could send the EPA back to the drawing board.\n\n\u2022 Housing discrimination. The third time could be the charm for the court's conservatives, who tried twice in recent years to consider cases challenging the way housing bias claims are decided.\n\nUnder the Fair Housing Act of 1968, minority groups have been able to win lawsuits by showing that housing practices \u2014 such as sales, rentals, zoning and lending \u2014 have a disparate impact on minorities. Housing industry opponents challenging the law say it was intended only to ban intentional discrimination.\n\n\u2022 Lethal injections. The death penalty also is never far from the high court's docket. After a steady diet of cases and emergency appeals on issues such as claimed intellectual disabilities and the actions of defense lawyers and prosecutors, the court now must rule on a relatively new method of execution.\n\nThe case involves the use of a sedative called midazolam as part of a three-drug cocktail used by several states, including Oklahoma, where three death-row inmates are challenging its use. Unlike stronger barbiturates that are in short supply, the drug has failed in some cases to block pain and suffering during the lethal injection process.\n\n\u2022 Political maps. In the second case to reach the court this year on political redistricting, the justices must decide whether nonpartisan commissions can replace state legislatures in drawing congressional district maps every 10 years.\n\nThose commissions are used in seven states, including California, to take the redistricting process out of the hands of politicians with a vested interest. But the Arizona state Legislature's Republican majority argued that the Constitution gives that power solely to state legislatures. A majority of the court's justices appeared to agree during oral arguments.\n\nFollow @richardjwolf on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1MP3mME", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A look at six important cases still to be decided before the Supreme Court term ends.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "A look at six important cases still to be decided before the Supreme Court term ends.", "title": "Half a dozen major cases await Supreme Court rulings", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/18/supreme-court-gay-marriage-obamacare/28920605/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A look at six important cases still to be decided before the Supreme Court term ends.", "title": "Half a dozen major cases await Supreme Court rulings", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b67e487749e5680b649866cc5e9102d3233ebd68/c=926-0-4427-3501&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/06/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635702235678659179-AP-Supreme-Court.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/U.S. Environmental Protection Agency", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/U.S. Environmental Protection Agency", "title": "Half a dozen major cases await Supreme Court rulings", "author": "Richard Wolf", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6c7ff6f457d582fce4bd0223d7640f42369002f3/c=1309-0-3935-3501/local/-/media/2015/06/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635702235678659179-AP-Supreme-Court.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/946c500cbc6e3bd9577aeef63349800947d03463/c=926-0-4427-3501/local/-/media/2015/06/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635702235678659179-AP-Supreme-Court.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f68c637fdeb49b7eabaaeae081e22f30644628b9/c=348-0-5004-3501/local/-/media/2015/06/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635702235678659179-AP-Supreme-Court.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f5bb221d5a891ed21aa4fe3b5c4a3f05b0611686/c=0-484-5339-3501&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/06/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635702235678659179-AP-Supreme-Court.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-06-18T13:28:22.010000-04:00", "shorthed": "Six big cases remain pending at high court", "articleid": 28920605, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c09ecf38355196d8da2320a5740da3ba4a8455ca/c=0-484-5339-3501/local/-/media/2015/06/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635702235678659179-AP-Supreme-Court.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a9b941041753bc5693a4e9c84de9ed7f6201dfed/c=1669-0-3630-3501/local/-/media/2015/06/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635702235678659179-AP-Supreme-Court.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Supreme,Court,gay,lesbian,marriage,Obamacare,redistricting,death,housing,pollution"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd374d\"", "article_summary": "Environmental regulations approved by the Obama administration regularly come before the Supreme Court, and this year is no exception.\nThe Supreme Court on June 18, 2015.\nA majority of the court's justices appeared to agree during oral arguments.\nFair elections, racial discrimination, clean air, capital punishment: All await rulings over the next two weeks as the court completes action on 11 cases remaining this term.\nWith major cases on license plates and religious signs decided Thursday along with four others, here are six big opinions still worth watching:\u2022 Same-sex marriage."}
