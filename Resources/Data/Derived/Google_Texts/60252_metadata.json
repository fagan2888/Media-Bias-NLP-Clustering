That\u2019s about $15,000 a year for a single persona and a little over $31,000 for a family of four.\n\nThe expansion will add about 325,000 people to the Medicaid rolls which will eventually extend to around a half million people.\n\nLessenberry says this won\u2019t go into effect until next spring. At that time people who are uninsured might have to pay a fine of about $95 a month.\n\nHe adds that Michigan doesn\u2019t have to pay for Medicaid until 2017 and will never have to pay more than 10 percent.\n\nFlint and Detroit have highest national violent crime rates per capita\n\nThe FBI released the latest violent crime data for 2012. Flint saw an overall rise in violent crime. The city reported 2,774 violent crimes in 2012. Detroit saw a small drop in violent crime with around 2,123 incidents in 2012.\n\nLessenberry says these statistics only count reported crimes, so there are actually more happening. But he says the numbers are still alarming.\n\n\u201cIn Detroit the situation is so hopeless now it takes the police an hour to come, even when there\u2019s a murder,\u201d Lessenberry says.\n\nLessenberry says it\u2019s clear both of these cities have a problem.\n\nHe says when he\u2019s spoken to criminologists about how to fix the problem, they have three solutions: \u201cYou need more jobs, you need more cops on the streets and you need fewer guns available.\u201d\n\nDetroit bankruptcy mediation process begins\n\nIn Detroit, the mediation portion of the city's bankruptcy began yesterday.\n\nThe city and its creditors are trying to find some common ground outside court.\n\nLessenberry says this process will help determine how fast or slow the bankruptcy process takes.\n\nRight now five judges are mediating with creditors and the city to make a deal.\n\n\u201cA lot of this will turn on whether creditors think they can get more money this way or by going through a bankruptcy process where it\u2019s all sort of a gamble,\u201d Lessenberry says. \u201cAlso, if they were to settle now or in the near future they will get whatever money they are going to get a lot faster probably than going through a bankruptcy process. It\u2019s not at all clear to what extent this will be successful.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Government", "description": "This week in Michigan politics Jack Lessenberry and Christina Shockley discuss the Medicaid expansion, crime rates in Detroit and Flint and the mediation", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://michiganradio.org/post/week-michigan-politics-medicaid-expansion-violent-crime-detroit-bankruptcy-mediation", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/michigan/files/styles/medium/public/201309/cncphotos_0.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "This week in Michigan politics Jack Lessenberry and Christina Shockley discuss the Medicaid expansion, crime rates in Detroit and Flint and the mediation", "title": "The week in Michigan politics: Medicaid expansion, violent crime, Detroit bankruptcy mediation"}, "story_id": 223674955, "twitter": {"site": "@MichiganRadio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@MichiganRadio"}, "author": "Jack Lessenberry, Christina Shockley, Emily Fox", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "The week in Michigan politics: Medicaid expansion, violent crime, Detroit bankruptcy mediation"}, "nid": 14470, "datePublished": "2013-09-18", "keywords": "FBI crime data, medicaid expansion, Detroit bankruptcy", "wordCount": 525, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce479\"", "article_summary": "Flint and Detroit have highest national violent crime rates per capitaThe FBI released the latest violent crime data for 2012.\nWeek in Michigan politics interview for 9/18/13This week in Michigan politics Jack Lessenberry and Christina Shockley discuss the Medicaid expansion, crime rates in Detroit and Flint and the mediation of Detroit\u2019s bankruptcy.\nLessenberry says this process will help determine how fast or slow the bankruptcy process takes.\nDetroit saw a small drop in violent crime with around 2,123 incidents in 2012.\nFlint saw an overall rise in violent crime."}
