Hundreds gathered Monday night to celebrate the annual tree-lighting in downtown Mountain View.

In Menlo Park

With its multicolored bulbs, the tree is impossible to miss among the string of traditional white lights that line the town’s famed Castro Street.In addition to the lighting, the event featured several activities for children including meeting Santa, tossing “snowball” marshmallows, and an arts and crafts table. The Huff Elementary School Honor Choir performed several holiday-themed pieces, much to the delight of residents, who were encouraged to bring a can of food to support the Community Services Agency.
