Jean Fuller, R-Bakersfield:\n\n\u2022 In addition to helping vets, Fuller said McCarthy has been invaluable in getting her access to federal regulators and members of the California congressional delegation who are key to securing federal help on water, specifically efforts to increase water storage and move water around.\n\n\u2022 She said he has also opened doors to top-level brass at the Pentagon when she\u2019s needed their ear on issues important to the military bases in her sprawling district.\n\n\u201cMaybe I could get some appointments myself but to have Kevin able to get the top guys is just really helpful,\u201d Fuller said.\n\nTreva Elliott, former McCarthy Assembly staffer:\n\n\u2022 Elliott said it was very hard for Republicans to accomplish much in Sacramento because they have no power there \u201cand haven\u2019t for decades.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Back home, she said, McCarthy made constituent work a top priority. Back in McCarthy\u2019s Assembly days, a lot of people were out of work and the system was \u201coverloaded\u201d with requests for unemployment checks, Elliott said. McCarthy made sure his staff helped people secure their money.\n\n\u201cWe were constantly on the phone with Sacramento trying to shake those checks loose so people could pay their rent and feed their children,\u201d Elliott said.\n\nCheryl Tierce, who is active in local Democratic Party politics:\n\n\u2022 Tierce complained McCarthy\u2019s Bakersfield office hasn\u2019t been as accessible as it should be. She said she used to go there once a month to drop off a letter or talk to staff about whatever the big vote in Congress was at the moment.\n\nStarting about October 2013, the doors were frequently locked, she said, and often staff wouldn\u2019t open the door. She said she stopped going after about eight or nine months of being locked out.\n\n\u201cI decided to stop wasting my time,\u201d Tierce said.\n\nTierce said McCarthy, as a House leader, could be doing much more on the big issues facing the district.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see some jobs bills. I\u2019d like to see something done about air quality,\u201d Tierce said. \u201cI\u2019m angry about the many, many attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. His vote to defund Planned Parenthood is disappointing.\u201d\n\nAsked to respond, McCarthy said his staff has had to lock the office in the past when protesters have overrun it. He said a couple times the office has shut down due to security threats.\n\nA reporter who dropped by Friday found the doors unlocked.\n\nAs for his political views and votes, McCarthy said he\u2019s sometimes going to differ with some people in his district but he \u201cwill always listen.\u201d He said he holds tele-town hall meetings nearly every month.\n\nCal State Bakersfield political science professor Mark Martinez:\n\n\u2022 There\u2019s no doubt McCarthy wields a lot of power and influence in Washington, Martinez said, \u201cbut when it comes to actual achievements at this point, there\u2019s nothing to speak of.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy himself:\n\n\u2022 McCarthy said he\u2019s helped develop a whole strategic plan to fight valley fever that includes the clinical trial, federal action to speed up valley fever drug development and establishment of a congressional valley fever caucus. He hinted new news on the clinical trial will be coming out soon.\n\n\u2022 He listed House passage of the Space Act, which is designed to encourage private sector investment in and create stable regulations for the commercial space industry. McCarthy is working to secure Senate support.\n\n\u2022 McCarthy said he\u2019s helped Edwards Air Force Base and Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake expand physically and in hiring.\n\n\u2022 And he said he\u2019s worked on drought legislation, including ongoing discussions with U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. (Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Visalia, said the House has passed several drought bills that just haven\u2019t gone anywhere in the Senate).\n\nThis past week, McCarthy was lead author of a letter signed by many GOP federal and state legislators asking the president and governor what\u2019s being done to capture El Ni\u00f1o water and to prevent the kinds of storm damage that hit Kern County two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cNot one bill comes to the floor I don\u2019t touch,\u201d McCarthy said, adding he\u2019s always thinking about what each could mean for his constituents.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some question how much Congressman Kevin McCarthy has done for his district while rising in Washington, especially compared to his predecessor, Bill Thomas, who secured some $630 million in federal transportation money for local road projects in 2005.
