Tinjedad, Morocco- As winter draws near, Muslim students at the University of Michigan have launched “Project Downtown”, a program that aims to provide meals to the homeless.

With this a philanthropic initiative, the Muslim students aim to provide a free meal to the homeless and reach out to the wider community.

Dissatisfied with the plight of homeless and needy individuals in their city, the students are gathering what little resources they have to feed the hungry.

Speaking to the State News on Monday, Amal Mohamed, psychology sophomore and volunteer chair for Project Downtown, said, “What we do is we make sandwiches for the homeless.

“We provide them with water bottles and chips and cookies and string cheese. And then we wrap them up individually for them,” she added.

Hiba Abu-Haltam, one of the board members of the project, said, “It’s really fun, we always get together and just make food together.”

“Whenever I go there, like this morning I went and they wrote me a thank you letter and it was really nice,” she added.

According to the same source, Muslim students in the United States often mobilize in different ways to address the needs of the poor or to simply to raise awareness about Islam.

Muslim students believe it is not necessary to take drastic measures to affect change.

However, only with good will and solidarity can Muslims show the true image of their religion and act in accordance with the teachings of Islam.

In accordance with the Islamic teachings, Muslims should engage in generous acts of charity and care for the needy: “We feed you for the sake of God alone, no reward do we seek, nor thanks.” (Holy Qur’an, 76:9).

Created in 2006, Project Downtown was launched to combat the rising rates of homelessness in the US.
