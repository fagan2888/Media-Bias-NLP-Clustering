That could squeeze access just when millions of new patients are gaining Medicaid coverage. A study Wednesday from the nonpartisan Urban Institute estimated fee reductions will average about 40 percent nationwide. But they could reach 50 percent or more for primary care doctors in California, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois \u2014 big states that have all expanded Medicaid under the health law. Meager pay for doctors has been a persistent problem for Medicaid, the safety-net health insurance program. Low-income people unable to find a family doctor instead flock to hospital emergency rooms, where treatment is more expensive and not usually focused on prevention.\n\nDoctors probably won't dump their current Medicaid patients, but they'll take a hard look at accepting new ones, said Dr. Robert Wergin, a practitioner in rural Milford, Neb., and president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. \"You are going to be paid less, so you are going to have to look at your practice and find ways to eke it out,\" Wergin said.\n\nMedicaid covers more than 60 million people, making the federal-state program even larger than Medicare. The health care law has added about 9 million people to the Medicaid rolls, as 27 states have taken advantage of an option that extends coverage to many low-income adults. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell says expanding Medicaid in the remaining 23 states is one of her top priorities. But the fee cut could make that an even harder sell, since it may reinforce a perception that the federal government creates expensive new benefits only to pass the bill to states.\n\nA former director of the Congressional Budget Office is predicting a rough tax season as a result of new provisions going into effect from the 2010 health care overhaul. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was head of the CBO from 2003 to 2005 and is currently president of the American Action Forum, said Dec. 5 that the Affordable Care Act's subsidy payments made for 2014 are unlikely to have been accurate, which means some people will have to reimburse the government for over-payments. Holtz-Eakin spoke at a forum sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research on what the next Republican Congress will do on health care. The 2015 tax filing season \u201cis going to be a disaster,\u201d he warned, adding that the result may be more traction in Congress for major changes to the law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Losing..05/26/2016 1:28:34AM EST.", "author": "Guy Benson", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Losing.", "title": "- Obamacare: Medicaid and Primary Doctor 'Access Shock,' Tax Season Chaos", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2014/12/12/obamacare-medicaid-and-primary-doctor-access-shock-tax-season-chaos-n1930687", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/105/2014-04-13T173009Z_1_CBREA3C1CMD00_RTROPTP_3_USA-HEALTHCARE-OBAMA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Losing.", "title": "- Obamacare: Medicaid and Primary Doctor 'Access Shock,' Tax Season Chaos", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2014/12/12/obamacare-medicaid-and-primary-doctor-access-shock-tax-season-chaos-n1930687", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/105/2014-04-13T173009Z_1_CBREA3C1CMD00_RTROPTP_3_USA-HEALTHCARE-OBAMA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obamacare: Medicaid and Primary Doctor 'Access Shock,' Tax Season Chaos, Guy Benson, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe28a4\"", "article_summary": "Holtz-Eakin spoke at a forum sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research on what the next Republican Congress will do on health care.\nA former director of the Congressional Budget Office is predicting a rough tax season as a result of new provisions going into effect from the 2010 health care overhaul.\nThat could squeeze access just when millions of new patients are gaining Medicaid coverage.\nMeager pay for doctors has been a persistent problem for Medicaid, the safety-net health insurance program.\nBut they could reach 50 percent or more for primary care doctors in California, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois \u2014 big states that have all expanded Medicaid under the health law."}
