We are duplicative in that we serve the same area but not the same in how we operate and take care of our members,\u201d Dr. David Howes, president and CEO of USFHP participant Martin\u2019s Point Health Care in Maine, told The Army Times. \u201cWe approach the care of patients in the same way the original HMO concept was intended, looking at the population and doing everything we can to improve their wellness.\u201d\n\nIn response to the report, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs Dr. Jonathan Woodson concurred with the auditor\u2019s findings, but said it\u2019s up to Congress to eliminate the program because doing so requires changing the existing law.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The government spends about $1 billion every year on a health care program for militar", "title": "DOD\u2019s $1B Redundant Health Program: GAO Says Scrap It", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/04/DOD-s-1B-Redundant-Health-Program-GAO-Says-Scrap-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/05292014_VA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/04/DOD-s-1B-Redundant-Health-Program-GAO-Says-Scrap-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/05292014_VA.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The government spends about $1 billion every year on a health care program for militar", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd87f7\"", "article_summary": "The government spends about $1 billion every year on a health care program for military families that auditors say is redundant and should be scrapped.\nCreated in 1982, The program\u2014USFHP\u2014is an association of six health care systems that provides TRICARE Prime benefits to military families.\n\u201cWe believe very strongly that this is the model of health care for the future.\nRelated: How Medicare Wastes Almost $50 B a YearGAO says it should be eliminated because it has a significant geographic overlap with existing Tricare Prime regions.\nGAO noted that the role of the program hasn\u2019t been reevaluated since TRICARE was implemented in the 1990s and urged lawmakers to consider scrapping the program."}
