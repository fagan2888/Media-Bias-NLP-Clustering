By that I mean that they are deployed in a narrow range of circumstances by a narrow range of actors who believe their religious liberty would be threatened by taking part in a specific act or service provision.\n\nInherent in this argument is the idea that the small harm done by allowing a few limited exceptions\u2014letting the Little Sisters of the Poor refuse to cover contraceptives or a baker to decline to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding\u2014is more than offset by the greater good of protecting the foundational right of religious liberty. For instance, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents the Little Sisters of the Poor, agues that the mandate would force a \u201csmall group of religious objectors into submission.\u201d\n\nBut what if that\u2019s not the case? What if it\u2019s not a \u201csmall group\u201d seeking exceptions, as suggested by the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s new analysis of employer health benefits plans?\n\nKaiser found in fact that 10 percent of nonprofits with more than 1,000 employees have requested an accommodation to the contraceptive mandate, as did five percent of firms with between 200 and 999 employees. According to Kaiser, \u201cmany of the nonprofits who have sought the accommodation are likely health systems or educational institutions affiliated with the Catholic Church, which objects to birth control.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kaiser, there are \u201cover 6,800 Catholic schools (5% of the national total and 22% of all private schools), 645 Catholic nonprofit hospitals, and more than 160 Catholic Charities agencies across the country.\u201d\n\nWhile most Catholic health care institutions have accepted the accommodation, a number of the nation\u2019s 260 Catholic institutions of higher learning as well as Catholic nonprofits are seeking a broader exemption that would in effect bar their insurers from providing contraceptive coverage as specified under the accommodation designed by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a consolidated case challenging the exemption in the spring. The large number of Catholic nonprofits currently using the accommodation and potentially seeking a broader exemption means that potentially thousands of women could lose contraceptive coverage and, according to Kaiser, would have to \u201cpay out of pocket for services that could potentially exceed hundreds of dollars a year.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Religion Dispatches", "description": "One of the assumptions behind those seeking a religious exception to the contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act\u2014as well as behind religious exceptions in general\u2014is that they are more or less exceptional.
