Indeed the Republican National Committee is so confident of victory that they have opened an office nearby.\n\nAs the debate progressed, the tough talk continued to grow \u2013 setting the tone for the upcoming election to replace outgoing Congressman, Jim Matheson. Owens said that Love has been on the record as wanting to end the student loan system, and during his remarks when he claimed she had benefited by that system as a borrower, she interrupted with an emphatic, \u201cWRONG.\u201d\n\nTo the assembled audience, Love indicated her preference that the tax code be simplified and reduced to a \u201cthree ring binder,\u201d offering a factoid that the current code has more than \u201c4 million words. That\u2019s more than the bible.\u201d At a Utah taxpayers group, it was squarely on message. Owens called out Love\u2019s prior affiliation with extreme positions by the tea party and the Ted Cruz / Mike Lee government shutdown crowd. \u201cTo approve what [Lee] had done, she went there and she applauded,\u201d referring to the costly government shutdown that most of the GOP is now disavowing. \u201cI intend to draw distinctions between us on positions, and I think that every politician in her shoes would like to sort of forget some of their past and just cast herself as a more moderate person at this point in time,\u201d he said. Owens believes that it is his job to tell the voters that \u201cthere is a clear record there.\u201d\n\nDuring the respective time allotments, Love thanked Owens for using her name during his comments, perhaps in an attempt to influence the cadence of her challenger\u2019s remarks. \u201cI\u2019m flattered that you bring up my name so much, that you\u2019re watching me so closely,\u201d she said at one point. After reiterating her commitment to seniors on Medicare but challenging \u201cObamacare,\u201d Love drew more of Owens fire when he countered with his claim that she had wanted to \u201cprivatize\u201d Medicare with a voucher system.\n\nThen the moderator, former Democratic lawmaker Frank Pignanelli, ignited the local powder keg issue when he asked the candidates about their positions on public lands and how they should be handled by congress. Love intends to pursue her party\u2019s efforts to emphasize state\u2019s local control and ownership, as with the recent efforts promoted by the American Lands Council.\n\nThe GOP largely wants to have the BLM release the federal government\u2019s control. But Owens indicated that while the state likes to trumpet its management prowess, it is not fiscally capable of managing the federal lands located in Utah. \u201cWe are on a gravy train here, and I would hesitate to interrupt that,\u201d referring to the amount of monies that federal government spends to manage land and open spaces presently involving sacred native american burial sites and other sensitive locales. Critics of the BLM would like to open more of the 20 million acres in Utah to development, saying that potential revenues would more than offset the costs.\n\nWhen Owen was asked if this kind of headbutting would be the norm during the campaign, he said that as a candidate, he would try to do a better job at describing their differences. \u201cShe\u2019s a fascinating person, and I\u2019m not attempting to disparage her personally,\u201d Owens stated. Love, for her part, said that \u201ca good indicator of somebody who doesn\u2019t have the qualifications to do the job\u2026the only thing they can do is actually attack the other person.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc023\"", "article_summary": "As the debate progressed, the tough talk continued to grow \u2013 setting the tone for the upcoming election to replace outgoing Congressman, Jim Matheson.\nBut Owens indicated that while the state likes to trumpet its management prowess, it is not fiscally capable of managing the federal lands located in Utah.\nOwens called out Love\u2019s prior affiliation with extreme positions by the tea party and the Ted Cruz / Mike Lee government shutdown crowd.\nIndeed the Republican National Committee is so confident of victory that they have opened an office nearby.\n\u201cShe\u2019s a fascinating person, and I\u2019m not attempting to disparage her personally,\u201d Owens stated."}
