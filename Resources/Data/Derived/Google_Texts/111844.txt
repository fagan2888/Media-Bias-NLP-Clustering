As far as many South Dakotan Republicans are concerned, President Obama should be impeached.

The state GOP passed a resolution over the weekend saying Mr. Obama “violated his oath of office in numerous ways” and pressing for his impeachment, Mediaite reported.

The resolution, which passed with a 191-176 vote, was sponsored by one GOP member who said he had a “thick book on impeachable offenses of the president,” the news blog reported. One detailed offense: Mr. Obama’s continued insistence that under Obamacare, Americans could keep the health care plans they wanted, despite growing proof to the contrary. Another cited offense: The exchange of five Taliban inmates at Guantanamo Bay for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, Mediaite reported.

But S.D. Rep. Kristi Noem wasn’t on board with the impeachment idea.

“The congresswoman currently believes the best way for Congress to hold the president accountable is to continue aggressive committee oversight and investigations into the administration’s actions like the ongoing VA scandal, the targeting of conservative groups by the IRS, Benghazi and the recent Taliban prisoner exchange,” one spokeswoman for the lawmaker’s office said in the Argus Leader.
