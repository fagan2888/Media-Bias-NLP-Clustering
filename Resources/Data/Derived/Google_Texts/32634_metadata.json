A few months later, some of those emails were recovered after Koskinen said under oath they had been lost forever. Since the announcement of the missing emails, Congress has asked Inspectors General from different departments to look into their recovery. The emails are key in getting to the bottom of the IRS' targeting of conservative groups.\n\n\"House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz remains concerned the IRS potentially mislead the American people about its efforts to recover former Director Lerner\u2019s emails. The IRS has claimed under oath that most of her emails from a key time period were destroyed by a crashed hard drive, that back-up tapes were erased, and were therefore unrecoverable,\" a statement from the Committee says. \"Through their ongoing efforts, the Inspector General\u2019s office has discovered that the back-up tapes do exist, the data on them was never erased, and the emails are in fact recoverable.\"\n\n\n\nThe hearing starts at 7 p.m. eastern.
