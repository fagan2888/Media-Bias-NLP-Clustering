It was an expensive bit of medicine, but Sovaldi is also the only effective treatment for the various types Hepatitis C, and the company had invested many years and many millions of dollars in research and development.\n\nHowever, when Pharmasset\u2019s new owner, Gilead, announced pricing for Sovaldi earlier this year, the estimated cost for a course of treatment was no longer the stunning $36,000, but an absolutely eye-popping $84,000.\n\nRelated: Get Ready for a Surge in Costly Specialty Drugs\n\nNoting, with considerable understatement, that \u201cthe price appears to be higher than expected,\u201d Wyden and Grassley pointed out that the federal government would likely be far and away the biggest purchaser of Sovaldi, and has a financial interest in understanding the costs of the drug. Particularly given the fact that it will be sold in other countries around the world at a 99 percent discount to what U.S. consumers are charged, they noted, there appear to be \u201cserious questions about the extent to which the market for this drug is operating efficiently and rationally.\u201d\n\n\u201cSovaldi\u2019s cost could dramatically increase federal spending in Medicare and other programs, including health care for prisoners with HCV,\u201d Wyden and Grassley wrote. \u201cAccording to a recent survey, over 1.8 million people with HCV are currently incarcerated. This represents nearly a third of the total cases of HCV in the U.S.\u201d\n\nDespite its courteous tone the letter to Gilead reads more like a prosecuting attorney\u2019s request for evidence than a polite inquiry about pharmaceutical price points. The eight-page document issues requests for 21 different categories of information, most of which are broken into various subcategories, and demands a rolling response beginning in 14 days, with a complete response expected in 60 days.\n\nAnd while Finance Committee representatives declined to say whether the committee views this as a major investigation, spokesman Ken Willis said, \u201cOur investigation team has been working on it. The idea is to get the Senators all the information they need to understand the pricing.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why You\u2019ll Spend More on Healthcare Next Year\n\nGilead did not respond to a request for comment on the investigation.\n\nRepresentatives of the health insurance industry \u2013 which would find itself on the hook for privately insured Hepatitis C patients, welcomed the Senators\u2019 action.\n\nOn Friday, Brendan Buck, vice president of Communications for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans said that he hopes this is just the beginning of an effort to shed light on how drug prices are set.\n\n\u201cWhat you saw today is a very important start to a look at transparency in this arena,\u201d Buck said. \u201cHealth plans, especially after the Affordable Care Act took effect, operate very transparently. There is very little transparency in drug pricing.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday put Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company responsible for the notorious $1,000 per pill Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, on notice that it\u2019s pricing practices are under investigation.", "title": "Senate Zeroes in on Inflated Hepatitis-C Drug Cost", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/13/Senate-Zeroes-Inflated-Hepatitis-C-Drug-Cost", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/pill_drone_flickr_Javorac.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/13/Senate-Zeroes-Inflated-Hepatitis-C-Drug-Cost", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/pill_drone_flickr_Javorac.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Senate Finance Committee on Wednesday put Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company responsible for the notorious $1,000 per pill Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, on notice that it\u2019s pricing practices are under investigation.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda492\"", "article_summary": "There is very little transparency in drug pricing.\u201dTop Reads from The Fiscal Times\n\u201cWhat you saw today is a very important start to a look at transparency in this arena,\u201d Buck said.\nRepresentatives of the health insurance industry \u2013 which would find itself on the hook for privately insured Hepatitis C patients, welcomed the Senators\u2019 action.\nThe Senators\u2019 curiosity was sparked by the revelation of a striking change in the plan to market Sovaldi after Gilead acquired its creator, New Jersey based research firm Pharmasset, in 2012.\n\u201cHealth plans, especially after the Affordable Care Act took effect, operate very transparently."}
