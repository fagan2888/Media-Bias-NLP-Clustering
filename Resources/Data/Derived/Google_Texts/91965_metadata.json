Photo by Larry Downing/Reuters\n\nThis entire week, people kept sending me emails with this screaming subject line: \u201cOBAMA MULLING SANCTIONS ON ISRAEL.VERIFICATION ON GOOGLE.\u201d\n\nNeither turned out to be true: Obama is not mulling sanctions, and Google doesn\u2019t verify the fact (or any fact, for that matter). In fact, Google links to stories that cite a single Haaretz report saying the Obama administration is upset about Israeli plans to continue settlement in East Jerusalem. That is not a secret, and it is a concern shared by previous administrations of both parties. But some right-wing journalist decided to substitute the word \u201cconcern\u201d for \u201csanctions.\u201d And an army of forwarders took it from there, stoking the anti-Obama flames among Israel supporters.\n\nThis has been going on since the 2008 presidential race, and I predict it will never end, not even if Obama stands up in Jerusalem and declares his unwavering support for a secure Israel, which he did; not even if he promotes unprecedented levels of high-level security cooperation between America and Israel, which he did; and not even if he stands before the Arab world and demands the recognition of Israeli rights, which he did.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what\u2019s truly amazing: The scare tactic is not working.\n\nIn the midst of all the coverage of the Republican sweep of the midterm elections, one astonishing fact has been overlooked: The Jewish vote remained heavily pro-Democrat.\n\nEven more noticeable, while President Barack Obama\u2019s approval rating has been in free fall, 57 percent of Jewish voters still approve of his performance, and 69 percent voted Democratic.\n\nThese numbers come from an exit poll of 800 Jewish voters conducted by the liberal advocacy group J Street immediately following the November elections. A similar poll conducted by Republican Jewish Coalition showed slightly less enthusiasm for the Democrats \u2014 about 4 percentage points less \u2014 but that number is within the margin of error.\n\nObama\u2019s approval rating among Jewish voters, according to J Street, is 15 points higher than among the general population.\n\nOn the one hand, this reflects a slide in the president\u2019s popularity. A year ago, a Pew Research Center survey found 65 percent of Jewish voters approved of the president\u2019s performance. And in 2012, he won 80 percent of the Jewish vote. Why the slide?\n\nIn foreign policy, the president\u2019s approach to Syria, ISIS and the turmoil in the Middle East is faltering, as if he\u2019s been calling the shots while focused on the Golf Channel.\n\nStylistically, he has come across as withdrawn, cerebral and defensive. Obama seems to throw a punch, then retreat to his corner. People who elected him to stand up to Mitch McConnell and John Boehner feel he\u2019s not 110 percent in the fight. At a time when America needs to be having a serious and sustained set of conversations and actions about race, Obama seems more follower than leader. In other words, the disappointment with Obama among Jews isn\u2019t because he\u2019s too radical, but too removed.\n\nBut the poll results still show more upside than downside at a time when the rest of America has all but written him off.\n\nThat just can\u2019t be explained away as traditional Jewish-American liberalism (not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that). President Jimmy Carter only got 45 percent of the Jewish vote in 1980, running against Ronald Reagan and independent John Anderson. History shows it takes more than a big \u201cD\u201d after your name to win Jewish support.\n\nIn Obama\u2019s case, his continued popularity with Jewish voters rests on several accomplishments: Obamacare, which a 2012 American Jewish Committee survey found popular with Jews (if not all Jewish doctors); the economy, which you might remember was barely breathing before Obama and his team resuscitated it and rescued the automobile industry; and his approach to immigration reform and the environment. Poll after poll shows these rank high among Jewish voters.\n\nWhat about Israel? Jews don\u2019t blame Obama for what is widely seen as frosty relations between the administration and the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Only 21 percent in a recent poll said Netanyahu\u2019s actions have helped American-Israeli relations.\n\nAnd there is also this: Support for Obama is informed by a deep distrust of the forces arrayed against him. Mainstream, economically conservative but socially liberal Republican voices with thoughtful foreign policy solutions who could credibly counter Obama have taken a back seat in their party to more hysterical, radically right voices. In the back of their minds, Jewish voters have to be wondering, \u201cIf not him, then who?\u201d\n\nSince those midterm exit polls were taken, Obama has taken unilateral steps that have proven even more popular with liberal voters. He\u2019s been a bit feistier, as his appearance on \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d this week showed. And he will get well-deserved credit for ending, early on, the CIA interrogation tactics that this week\u2019s Senate report found brutal and ineffective. Will he leave office as beloved by Jewish voters as Bill Clinton? Maybe not. But there\u2019s still a lot he may yet do to become even more popular, like give a rousing endorsement to a Hillary Clinton-Elizabeth Warren ticket for 2016. And remind Americans of how far we\u2019ve come since 2008.\n\nOther voters already may have forgotten about these achievements, but Jews, who this week mark events from 167 B.C.E., have memories that can stretch back at least six years.\n\nHappy Chanukah.\n\nRob Eshman is publisher and editor-in-chief of TRIBE Media Corp./Jewish Journal.
