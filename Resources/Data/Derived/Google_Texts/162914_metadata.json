And Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, has launched a massive recruiting drive for fighters to seize territory in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia to add to what it already controls in Libya.\n\nSeveral Taliban-linked groups control territory in Afghanistan and the Pakistani badlands of Waziristan.\n\nJihadi \u201cstartups\u201d are also taking shape in China\u2019s Xinjiang province and the Ferghana Valley in Central Asia.\n\nLast month, al Qaeda\u2019s leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, announced a new Indian jihadi startup aiming to seize territory in parts of Kashmir.\n\nOther targets include several autonomous republics in the Russian Federation, the island of Mindanao in the Philippines, two provinces in southern Thailand and enclaves in Myanmar (Burma).\n\nTurkey is also in immediate danger. Though refusing to join President Obama\u2019s anti-ISIS coalition, it\u2019s not immune to the jihadi threat. Reportedly, ISIS elements may already be setting up Turkish bases near the Syrian and Iraqi borders. Other caliph \u201cwannabes\u201d are eyeing Lebanon and Jordan.\n\nAnd Egypt must worry seriously about losing control to Jihadis in parts of the Sinai.\n\nBut the jihadi strategy of seizing territory is most advanced in Yemen. Al Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, already has control of the southeastern province of Hadhramaut (on the border of Oman) \u2014 whose huge oil resources could in time generate enough income for a new jihadi caliphate.\n\nAnd in Yemen\u2019s north, the Iran-backed al-Houthis has seized control of three provinces near the Saudi border, and threatens to capture the capital, Sanaa.\n\nThese jihadis have also set up port facilities on the Red Sea, making it easier for Iran to supply them with arms and volunteers.\n\nYet Iran itself risks a dose of jihadi medicine. The Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice), a startup Sunni group, aims to use bases inside Pakistan to set up an \u201cemirate\u201d in the Pishin enclave.\n\nLast week, there were reports, denied by Tehran officials, of Sunni jihadi groups seizing a number of villages inside Iran close to the Iraqi border.\n\nThe jihadis\u2019 shift to a strategy of seizing terrority began with the 2007 book by Abubakar al-Naji, dubbed \u201cal Qaeda\u2019s chief theoretician.\u201d (I discussed the book, \u201cGovernance in the Wilderness,\u201d in a July 1, 2008, Post column.)\n\nIn his work, now the basic textbook of jihadism, Naji claims that the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the abolition of the Islamic Caliphate in 1924 marked the start of \u201cthe most dangerous phase in history.\u201d\n\nThose events put all Arab countries, the heartland of Islam, under domination by the \u201cinfidel,\u201d who later continued to rule via native proxies.\n\nIn Naji\u2019s eyes, it is impossible to create a proper Islamic state in a single country in a world dominated by \u201cCrusaders.\u201d He cites as example the Taliban \u2014 which, although a proper Islamic regime, couldn\u2019t hold against \u201cinfidel\u201d attacks and opposition by Afghan elements.\n\nInstead, he says, the Islamic movement must be global \u2014 fighting everywhere, all the time, on all fronts.\n\nAfter years of debate, jihadis have concluded that Osama bin Laden was premature if not totally wrong to think the \u201cInfidel\u201d could be brought down with a few spectacular attacks.\n\nPre-9/11, jihadis killed or took hostage only relatively small numbers of the \u201cInfidel\u201d (especially Americans) \u2014 and Western leaders declined to mobilize their publics for a counterattack.\n\nThe 9/11 attacks made it impossible for US leaders to continue doing nothing \u2014 and equally impossible for the jihadi movement to maintain momentum by bleeding the \u201cInfidel\u201d drip by drip.\n\nSomething else was needed. Naji argued that the movement must aim to turn the world into a series of \u201cwildernesses\u201d where only those under jihadi rule enjoy security. He urged extending low-intensity war to countries with a significant Muslim presence.\n\nUsing cyberspace, jihadi groups are already promoting the creation of \u201cvirtual caliphates\u201d within Muslim communities in Europe, the Americas and India.\n\nThe idea is that by asserting a strong \u201cIslamic presence,\u201d jihadis can force the \u201cInfidel\u201d to submit to aspects of Islamic life and, in time, accept de facto Islamic domination (sultah).\n\nNaji recommends kidnappings, hostage-taking, the use of women and children as human shields, high-profile terror killings, suicide bombings and endless gestures to make normal life impossible for the \u201cenemy\u201d and for \u201cdeviant Muslims.\u201d\n\nThe monster of Islamist terror is capable of frequent mutations.
