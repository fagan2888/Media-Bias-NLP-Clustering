Michilea Patterson \u2014 Digital First Media\n\nThe theme for the 2016 National Minority Health Month is \u201cAccelerating Health Equity for the Nation\u201d and the goal is to bring everyone together to address the health disparities that still exist for racial and ethnic populations.\n\nNational Minority Health Month began in 1915 when Dr. Booker T. Washington proposed the observance of \u201cNational Negro Health Week.\u201d 100 years later, organizations are working toward the goal of eliminating barriers to health among minority groups.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of National Minority Health Month is to raise awareness of the importance of health and wellbeing in minority populations but also to shine a light on the health disparities that continue to persist among minority populations,\u201d said Dr. J. Nadine Gracia, director of the Office of Minority Health at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nGracia completed all her medical training in Pennsylvania and attended the University of Pittsburgh as well as completed a fellowship at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. During her medical training, she saw first-hand how where people live, play and work affect health. During home visits of patients, Gracia would witness the barriers to transportation, affordable healthy food, safe playgrounds and more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis year also marks the 30th anniversary of the Office of Minority Health which began in 1986 as a result of a report released on Black and minority health which became known as the Heckler Report. Gracia said tremendous progress has been made in the last 30 years. The life expectancy between African Americans and Whites is the narrowest it\u2019s ever been, she said. She said another achievement to highlight is the impact the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, has had on the uninsured.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama announced that in the six years since the Affordable Care Act was passed, about 20 million Americans have gained health coverage and some of those largest gains have actually been among racial and ethnic minorities,\u201d Gracia said.\n\nShe said the rate of the uninsured among African Americans declined by more than 50 percent since 2013 and added that the 2016 enrollment program in Pennsylvania had 440,000 people sign up for coverage.\n\n\u201cWe made important progress but we also see that disparities persist,\u201d Gracia said. \u201cIn Pennsylvania, African American adults are 44 percent more likely to die from diabetes and we see higher rates of stroke and heart disease.\u201d\n\nGracia said when it comes to moving forward in eliminating health disparities, it\u2019s going to take different sectors working together to overcome barriers. She said even individuals that aren\u2019t in the healthcare industry can still improve the health of their community by addressing other social areas like education, transportation and recreation.\n\n\u201cIn working to reduce health disparities, it takes all of us,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Lifestyle, Lifestyle news, West Chester Lifestyle news, PA Lifestyle news, US Lifestyle news, world Lifestyle news.", "title": "Minority Health Month shines light on progress and areas of need", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailylocal.com/article/DL/20160414/NEWS/160419867", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailylocal.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/DL/20160414/NEWS/160419867/AR/0/AR-160419867.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1000px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Minority Health Month shines light on progress and areas of need"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailylocal.com", "description": "The theme for the 2016 National Minority Health Month is \u201cAccelerating Health Equity for the Nation\u201d and the goal is to bring everyone together to address the health disparities that still exist for racial and ethnic populations.", "title": "Minority Health Month shines light on progress and areas of need", "url": "http://www.dailylocal.com/article/DL/20160414/NEWS/160419867", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailylocal.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/DL/20160414/NEWS/160419867/AR/0/AR-160419867.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@wcdailylocal", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563329788", "iphone": "id525116294", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.dailylocalnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Lifestyle, Lifestyle news, West Chester Lifestyle news, PA Lifestyle news, US Lifestyle news, world Lifestyle news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "The theme for the 2016 National Minority Health Month is \u201cAccelerating Health Equity for the Nation\u201d and the goal is to bring everyone together to address the health disparities that still exist for racial and ethnic populations."}, "article_summary": "AdvertisementThis year also marks the 30th anniversary of the Office of Minority Health which began in 1986 as a result of a report released on Black and minority health which became known as the Heckler Report.\nNational Minority Health Month began in 1915 when Dr. Booker T.
