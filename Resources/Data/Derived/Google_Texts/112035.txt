"We believe the current system of financing [long-term services and supports] is inadequate, especially for those with high levels of need," the Long-Term Care Financing Collaborative said in a report detailing its proposals.

"It puts an enormous burden on family members and friends, often results in poor care, and frequently causes preventable harm that endangers recipients of care and their caregivers, and increases medical costs."

The Long-Term Financing Collaborative is project of Convergence, a Washington-based nonprofit founded in 2009 to address pressing social and policy issues. The collaborative's report noted that more than 6 million older adults currently need high levels of care, and that the number of such adults is expected to grow to 16 million in the next 50 years.

About half of all people over the age of 65 will need such care before they die, and the typical recipient will need that assistance for two years at an average total cost of $140,000, according to the collaborative, which is comprised of policy analysts, consumer advocates and officials from the long-term care industry.

The collaborative said the "hybrid public/private insurance approach" it calls for would "prevent gaps between Medicaid and the private market," and better protect millions of people from the risk of being impoverished by long-term care needs.
