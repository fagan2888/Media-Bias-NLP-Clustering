State Medicaid directors have struggled to restrict usage. A Congressional hearing was held. And at one point, the nation\u2019s biggest pharmacy benefit manager urged companies and health plans to switch to medicines by rival companies once those drugs are approved.\n\nBut the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority has decided on a different tack. The transit agency, which serves the greater Philadelphia area, last week filed an unusual lawsuit claiming that Gilead is price gouging. The drug maker charges $84,000 for a 12-week regimen, or $1,000 a pill and is not known to have offered a discount in this country, except to the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs.\n\nIn arguing its case, the transit agency claims that, by using \u201cexorbitant pricing,\u201d Gilead has made it difficult for some consumers and government programs to afford its medication and, subsequently, violated antitrust laws. The lawsuit also maintains the drug maker engages in discriminatory pricing, which violates the Affordable Care Act, because hepatitis C sufferers are \u201cdisabled.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re public stewards of the taxpayer\u2019s money and we thought it was an opportunity to get some of that money back, because we\u2019re spending a fair amount of money on this drug,\u201d says Gino Benedetti, the general counsel at the transit agency. The agency has spent more than $2.4 million on Sovaldi through the first 11 months of this year, according to the lawsuit, which seeks class-action status.\n\nA Gilead spokeswoman says the lawsuit is \u201ccompletely devoid of merit and [the drug maker] will forcefully defend against it.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, the lawsuit generated a lot of buzz. With a cure rate exceeding 90%, Sovaldi prompted physicians to write prescriptions to a growing number of the estimated 3.2 million Americans believed to be infected. But while Sovaldi helped transform care for what had been a hard-to-treat chronic disease, the cost has flummoxed some critics who cheered the agency for filing its lawsuit.\n\nThe transit agency has \u201cdone what a lot of people have talked about doing,\u201d says Matt Salo, executive director at the National Association of Medicaid Directors. \u201cThis drug has been a game changer. We deal with expensive drugs all the time, but the number of patients for this drug is growing. This is what gets people on edge and the manufacturer is not budging on price.\u201d\n\nBut whether the lawsuit can succeed may be another matter. The law allows a monopoly \u2013 and right now, Gilead is the only drug maker to sell such a treatment \u2013 to set prices as high as it chooses. A key reason is that, by permitting such behavior, the law offers incentives to companies to enter and develop a market, which can later foster competition.\n\n\u201cMonopolists, themselves, are not unlawful. They are allowed to charge any price they want. It\u2019s only if they take any anticompetitive conduct that a problem may exist,\u201d says Ankur Kapoor, an attorney at the Constantine Cannon law firm who specializes in antitrust law. He notes that antitrust laws do not have price-gouging provisions, \u201cI can\u2019t recall seeing a case like this,\u201d he says.\n\nAs a result, the Gilead pricing is unlikely to be considered illegal, experts say. The transit agency is \u201ccomplaining about high prices. But having a monopoly and setting high prices do not violate antitrust law,\u201d says C. Scott Hemphill, a professor at the Columbia Law School, who specializes in antitrust issues and intellectual property. \u201cJudging from the complaint, the antitrust claim is meritless.\u201d\n\nAn attorney for the transit agency, Nicholas Chimicles, responded by saying that \u201cwe are confident in the viability of the claims\u2026 The rather stark and unusual facts surrounding the excessive and discriminatory pricing of Sovaldi provide a compelling foundation for our lawsuit. And we are confident we will prevail, thereby benefiting many hepatitis C victims across the country.\u201d\n\nHe is also reviewing the possibility of amending the lawsuit to include pricing for Harvoni, a newer Gilead treatment that offers more convenience. This drug, which was just launched two months ago, can cost anywhere from $63,000 to $94,500, depending upon the regimen, and Wall Street expects Harvoni to gradually eclipse Sovaldi. In fact, one insurer says this evolution is well under way.\n\n\u201cIn our commercial business, Harvoni has quickly become the primary treatment,\u201d says Chris Bradbury, vice president for integrated clinical and specialty drug solutions at Cigna. While he applauds the high cure rate, he sympathizes with the transit agency. These drugs \u201cprovide great clinical impact, but the prices are excessive. That will create an undue burden on our customers and society as a whole.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Legal experts say a lawsuit accusing Gilead Sciences of price gouging is meritless.", "title": "Gilead is Accused of Price Gouging, but is There Really a Legal Argument?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/12/19/gilead-is-accused-of-price-gouging-but-is-there-really-a-legal-argument/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DU833_0723gi_G_20140723130826.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "article.headline": "Gilead is Accused of Price Gouging, but is There Really a Legal Argument?", "description": "Legal experts say a lawsuit accusing Gilead Sciences of price gouging is meritless.", "author": "Ed Silverman", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Pharmalot Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Pharmalot", "article.summary": "Legal experts say a lawsuit accusing Gilead Sciences of price gouging is meritless.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-12-19T14:03:34-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/12/19/gilead-is-accused-of-price-gouging-but-is-there-really-a-legal-argument/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-270B-1219", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Legal experts say a lawsuit accusing Gilead Sciences of price gouging is meritless.", "title": "Gilead is Accused of Price Gouging, but is There Really a Legal Argument?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/12/19/gilead-is-accused-of-price-gouging-but-is-there-really-a-legal-argument/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DU833_0723gi_G_20140723130826.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Pharmalot", "article.id": "BL-270B-1219", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-12-19T14:03:46-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2815\"", "article_summary": "The transit agency, which serves the greater Philadelphia area, last week filed an unusual lawsuit claiming that Gilead is price gouging.\nAs a result, the Gilead pricing is unlikely to be considered illegal, experts say.\nWhile he applauds the high cure rate, he sympathizes with the transit agency.\nEver since Gilead Sciences began selling its Sovaldi hepatitis C treatment, there has been controversy over the price.\nThe transit agency has \u201cdone what a lot of people have talked about doing,\u201d says Matt Salo, executive director at the National Association of Medicaid Directors."}
