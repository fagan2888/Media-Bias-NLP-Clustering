Obamacare won a key victory, and as a result it\u2019s going to be much harder for Republican politicians to roll it back in the future. There is a great deal wrong with the Affordable Care Act, to be sure, but at least it represents the acknowledgment that the general health of the nation\u2019s citizens is a legitimate government concern.\n\nThe Confederate flag \u2013 specifically, the famous Stars & Bars battle jack \u2013 and the deeply ingrained racism it represents took a major ass-whipping. No, striking a symbol of treason and prejudice won\u2019t make racism go away \u2013 any more than electing a black president did \u2013 but it\u2019s a meaningful symbolic victory in a long cultural war. If that flag flies on the grounds of the statehouse, it\u2019s an express acknowledgement to everyone that it\u2019s okay to celebrate a \u201cheritage\u201d built on slavery.\n\nFinally, speaking of big wins in the long culture war, the Supreme Court ruled that gay people ought to have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nJune 2015, in other words, has been an unrelenting dark smackdown of a month for America\u2019s reactionary conservative movement, and if you\u2019re the hopeful sort you may be asking is this where we finally get serious about dismantling the semantic and policy infrastructure that has done so much harm to so many innocent people for the last two generations.\n\nMeanwhile, Bernie Sanders is doing far better in the polls than Hillary Clinton\u2019s handlers are happy about, I\u2019m guessing.\n\nSo there\u2019s good news. Progress, even. But with it has come a big dose of counterproductive rhetoric. I\u2019m not going to bother linking things, because if you\u2019ve paid close attention you\u2019ve heard what I have.\n\nExample: in his marriage equality dissent, which was as long on petulance as it was short on substance, Justice Antonin Scalia waxed dire on how everybody was ignoring the Constitution. \u201cFive lawyers\u201d just took it upon themselves to make shit up, pretty much, and that\u2019s not what Supreme Court justices are supposed to do. They\u2019re supposed to adhere strictly to the letter of what the document says, and we all know by now the evil that lurks in the heart of the \u201cactivist judge.\u201d\n\nI used to be a bit of a strict constructionist type myself, and it isn\u2019t hard to understand how intelligent people might revere, perhaps overmuch, a framework that has in many respects stood as the most successful political document of its type in history. People like me are fond of pointing out all that we get wrong here in the US, but it\u2019s impossible to ignore the true moments of greatness we have achieved, and it would be silly to pretend that a skyscraper\u2019s majestic imprint on the skyline had nothing at all to do with the foundation upon which it was constructed.\n\nI\u2019m critical, but I\u2019m not stupid.\n\nAll that said, now is as good a time as any to step back and view our Constitution honestly. In fact, it\u2019s an artifact of a pre-industrial agrarian culture, conceived and articulated three decades before the first locomotive took to the tracks. Strict adherence to its wisdom is difficult when it was written by men whose idea of advanced technology was a buggy whip.\n\nAnd those men\u2026 The documents that we get all misty-eyed about make ample use of the word \u201cpeople.\u201d \u201cWe the people.\u201d \u201cOf the people, by the people and for the people.\u201d \u201cWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people.\u201d \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons.\u201d Ten times in the Declaration of Independence, five more in the Bill of Rights.\n\nBut who were these \u201cpeople\u201d? Truth is, \u201cpeople\u201d was a euphemism\u201d that meant \u201crich white men.\u201d\n\nThe only \u201cpeople\u201d who counted were wealthy landowners. All were white. All were men. Women couldn\u2019t vote and black folks were property, some of whom were more valuable than horses and others \u2026 I suppose some of the less productive ones probably wouldn\u2019t have fetched a goat in trade.\n\nWe\u2019re a society that can\u2019t say \u201cJefferson\u201d without tearing up and genuflecting, but the great beacon of freedom and democracy was a slave owner. I don\u2019t want to hear about the political realities of that inbred delegation of cavalier wanks from South Carolina, not now, not ever. Jefferson chose to own slaves and he knew it was wrong. And maybe worse. I don\u2019t know that his long affair with Sally Hemings began with rape, but I imagine the concept of \u201cconsent\u201d is considerably more complicated when one party literally owns the other and can, at his whim, have her beaten, tortured, hung and fed to the hogs with no fear of legal retribution. We also don\u2019t know how often he ambled out to the slave quarters for a taste of other varieties of brown sugar. Did he ever feel an obligation to be faithful to her? Who the hell is faithful to chattel?\n\nThese are the facts. When Scalia and his cronies get their backs up about the sanctity of the Constitution, and when we\u2019re duped into following along like so many hollow-eyed flagellants, this is what we are pledging our allegiance to. How often do we hear some variation of \u201cif the founding fathers could see X, they\u2019d be rolling over in their graves\u201d? Often the imagined outrage involves some privileged gazillionaire or another, or perhaps one of the corporations they run, behaving with the same regard for the commonweal we normally associate with the divinely ordained medieval aristocracy.\n\nI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re thinking when we do this. If the founding fathers were here they\u2019d look around, see powerful white men doing whatever the hell they pleased and say yeah, this is coming along nicely.\n\nScalia pitched a hissy fit because \u201cfive lawyers\u201d took it upon themselves to right an unarguable wrong and to decree that we should not deny to one group of Americans the basic rights we accord to another. Any Constitution that makes it legal to do otherwise is corrupt and should be discarded. Period.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the even more important part. Any official who uses the Constitution to deny justice to one segment of the population should be, at a minimum, stripped of his or her office and tossed into prison. At the maximum? What\u2019s that thing conservatives like to say about watering the tree of liberty?\n\nStill, this has been our reality. How often have the custodians of our theocratic oligarchy used the Constitution to deny freedom, justice and opportunity? How often have they hidden behind the utterly corrupt doctrine of \u201cstate\u2019s rights,\u201d as though whether or not black people should be property is really best left up to slave owners in the Mississippi legislature?\n\nI know this is heresy, but our Constitution has often been as effective a tool for oppression as it has for freedom and it\u2019s high time we stopped treating it as a sacred text ordained by the gods. It\u2019s time we stopped treating our nation\u2019s founders as shamans and priests ordained by those gods and their words as ex cathedra pronouncements to be worshipped as surely as if they were spoken by the gods themselves.\n\nI addressed some of these issues two years ago in my New Constitution project, and I\u2019m not sure my thinking has changed. No doubt some of the details could use work, but at the core was the acknowledgement that our current constitution is largely inappropriate for the 21st century and that history and tradition are never justifications for doing the wrong thing today.\n\nAmericans ought to be smart enough to know all this and we as a nation deserve better. We deserve a system of government that represents the best interests of everyone, not just the wealthy white conservative Christian power elite.\n\nIt\u2019s time we put our history in the past, especially those portions of it devoted to hate, prejudice and oppression, and began working toward a legal foundation for a just, productive future.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Progressive Culture | Scholars & Rogues", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "It\u2019s time we stopped worshipping the Constitution and our \u201cfounding\u00a0fathers\u201d | Progressive Culture | Scholars & Rogues on WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Progressive Culture | Scholars & Rogues", "description": "For our founding fathers,\u00a0\u201cpeople\u201d was a euphemism\u201d that meant \u201crich white men.\u201d Sadly, the same is true for many of our current leaders.
