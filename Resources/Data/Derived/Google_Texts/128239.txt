Jesse Jackson in South Carolina for Voter Drive

by ABC News

Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson is touring South Carolina to encourage people to vote.

The Greenville native points out there are 1.2 million African-Americans in the state who are eligible to vote. He says about 1 million of them are registered.

Jackson says he is also urging South Carolina to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, where the federal government pays most of the cost.

Jackson plans to be in Orangeburg on Saturday morning. He moves on through Barnwell and Bamberg counties and will be in Aiken for an afternoon rally.

Jackson will attend rallies Sunday at churches in Columbia, Chester and Rock Hill.

He will be in Winnsboro on Monday morning, followed by Midlands Technical College at noon and Allen University in Columbia that afternoon.
