The state\u2019s Sixth, Seventh and Eighth congressional districts are all part of Greater Philadelphia, they all gave President Obama 53% of the vote in 2008 before all narrowly switching to Mitt Romney in 2012, and they are all represented by Republicans in the House. The retirement of one of these members, Rep. Jim Gerlach (R, PA-6), gave Democrats hopes that they could peel off one of these districts. However, candidate recruitment hasn\u2019t gone the way they hoped: National Democrats were hoping that businessman Mike Parrish would be their candidate, but he dropped out last month, leaving physician Manan Trivedi as the likely nominee.Gerlach scored 57% of the vote against Trivedi in both 2010 and 2012, by far the two strongest of his six victories in this swingy seat, which was made more Republican in post-2010 redistricting. Moreover, Republicans feel good about their candidate, Chester County Commissioner Ryan Costello (R). This seat now LEANS REPUBLICAN.\n\nLike Sabato, the NRCC sees Parrish\u2019s withdraw as a good sign for the GOP to hold onto this seat following Gerlach\u2019s retirement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear after last week\u2019s special election in Florida that Democrats\u2019 chances in 2014 are sinking faster than a boat without a hull. It seems like just yesterday that the DCCC was sending out memos touting Mike Parrish\u2019s candidacy and flying Nancy Pelosi in to fundraise for him,\u201d NRCC spokesman Ian Prior told PoliticsPA. \u201cJust a few weeks later, however, Parrish has seen first-hand how difficult it is running straight into the massive headwinds caused by Obamacare. It\u2019s certainly understandable that he would want to jump ship.\u201d\n\nApril 10th, 2014 | Posted in Congress, Front Page Stories, Top Stories | 4 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Political analyst Larry Sabato moved the rating of PA-6 from Toss Up to Leans Republican following Mike Parrish\u2019s departure from the race.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "og": {"url": "http://www.politicspa.com/pa-6-sabato-declares-open-seat-leans-republican/56855/", "description": "Political analyst Larry Sabato moved the rating of PA-6 from Toss Up to Leans Republican following Mike Parrish\u2019s departure from the race.", "title": "PA-6: Sabato Declares Open Seat \u201cLeans Republican\u201d"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 775768999125308}, "keywords": "pa 6,sabato,gerlach,trivedi,parrish,costello", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd719\"", "article_summary": "PA-6: Sabato Declares Open Seat \u201cLeans Republican\u201dWritten by Brittany Foster, Managing EditorFollowing the withdrawal of Democrat Mike Parrish from the race for PA-6, political analyst Larry Sabato moved the rating of the seat from Toss Up to Leans Republican.\nThis seat now LEANS REPUBLICAN.\nLike Sabato, the NRCC sees Parrish\u2019s withdraw as a good sign for the GOP to hold onto this seat following Gerlach\u2019s retirement.\nThe retirement of one of these members, Rep.
