Demonstrating Wine M&A Interest, J.W. Childs Invests in Kosta Browne Winery

Investors are expecting to continue soaking in wine and spirits businesses in 2015

Boston private equity firm J.W. Childs Associates has invested in Kosta Browne winery.

Kosta Browne, based in Sebastopol, California, is a winery that produces Pinot Noir. The business was started by Dan Kosta and Michael Browne, who founded Kosta Browne with tip money the earned working in a Santa Rosa, California restaurant. The winery added the Vincraft Group, which backs small wineries, as an investor in 2009. Terms of J.W. Childs investment were not disclosed.

The winemaker bought its first vineyard in 2013, acquiring 20 acres from the Keefer Ranch Vineyard.

J.W. Childs' investment, which it made out of its fourth fund, will help the business look for further acquisitions. The private equity firm has invested more than $3 billion in equity capital in more than 40 consumer, specialty retail and health care businesses. The firm's portfolio companies include Sunny Delight Beverages Co. and NutraSweet.

We're expecting more interest in wine and other spirits in 2015. In 2014, there were several wine and spirits deals, including Kieu Hoang Winery's acquisition of the Guilliams Vineyards in California, and Constellation Brands' (NYSE: STZ) deal for Casa Noble tequila.
