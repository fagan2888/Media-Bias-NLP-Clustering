It was not only the bar owner who was making money at one Wichita establishment, it was also the stay at home moms selling headbands.

Emerson Biggin's in west Wichita was near capacity, an estimated 350 people were crammed inside watching both the KU and Shocker game. Usually, Sunday afternoons are quiet and easy going for staff at the bar, but this Sunday was just as busy as a rowdy Saturday night.

Unfortunately for the bar owner, sales did not reach the $10,000 mark like he would have liked, but they still were well above normal.

In the mix of people were two stay-at-home moms; they saw the game as an opportunity to make a little money. "We had the idea on our patio," said Desi Connor, one of the moms, "everyone is a shocker fan right now." Connor and her friend Sarah Buell made headbands out of t-shirt fabric, printed on them was the word "angry" with a shock of wheat next to it.

It was very opportunistic for these ladies to sell the WSU apparel at a WSU game, and even better for them, each band was selling for $10 a piece. Neither women had a figure for how much money they had made, but they did say they were selling them so fast it was hard to keep up.

Today is the last day these women will be able to sell the headbands with much success. Wichita State lost to Kentucky after a well played game in St. Louis.
