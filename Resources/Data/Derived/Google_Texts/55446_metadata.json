I just sit down\u2026 and I will be unsigning many, maybe not all. Maybe there\u2019s a couple of good ones [Obama policies], I don\u2019t know, I doubt it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut we\u2019re going to be unsigning a lot of executive orders, especially his [Obama\u2019s] order that basically lets anybody they want just pour into our country. That\u2019s going to end,\u201d the billionaire added.\n\nThe order he\u2019s referencing is Obama\u2019s much-contested November 2014 executive order that granted legal status to five million illegal immigrants. Many legal experts considered the president\u2019s act unconstitutional and the courts have blocked its implementation.

Immediately working on Medicare so that we really make it strong. We\u2019re going to bring great things back to this country. You\u2019re going to be so proud of me.\u201d\n\nThe GOP front-runner spoke before a crowd of over thousand people gathered at the Prince William County Fairgrounds on a dreary night. The audience included a surprisingly large number of young people, some of whom were still in high school.\n\nBut not all attendees were Trump supporters. Nearly 100 protesters showed up at the event and, according to local news outlet WTOP, included members of NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia and immigration advocacy group CASA In Action. At least one protester was escorted out of the building by security before Trump was introduced, and other demonstrators attempted to disrupt the presidential candidate midway through his speech with a \u201cDump Trump\u201d chant.\n\nBesides discussing what he would do in his first 100 days in office, Trump tackled the usual subjects of illegal immigration, China and colorful insults for his Republican rivals. For example, the mogul dubbed Jeb Bush \u201cThe Sleepmaster\u201d for giving \u201clow-energy\u201d speeches.\n\nFollow Scott on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Scott Greer", "description": "'You know the great thing about executive orders is that I don't have to go back to Congress'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "MANASSAS, Va. -- During a packed Wednesday night rally only a few miles outside of Washington D.C., Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump suggested that if he were elected president, he mig", "title": "Trump Suggests He\u2019ll Use Executive Orders To \u2018Unsign\u2019 Obama\u2019s Agenda", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/12/03/trump-suggests-hell-use-executive-orders-to-unsign-obamas-agenda/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2015-12-03T032811Z_1_LYNXMPEBB2047_RTROPTP_4_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP-e1449672117665.jpg", "height": 516}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'You know the great thing about executive orders is that I don't have to go back to Congress'", "title": "Trump Suggests He\u2019ll Use Executive Orders To \u2018Unsign\u2019 Obama\u2019s Agenda Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/12/03/trump-suggests-hell-use-executive-orders-to-unsign-obamas-agenda/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2015-12-03T032811Z_1_LYNXMPEBB2047_RTROPTP_4_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP-e1449672117665.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-12-03 00:41:30", "sailthru.title": "Trump Suggests He'll Use Executive Orders To 'Unsign' Obama's Agenda", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "donald-trump,elections-2016,scott-greer", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "donald trump,elections 2016,executive amnesty,executive order", "sailthru.description": "MANASSAS, Va. -- During a packed Wednesday night rally only a few miles outside of Washington D.C., Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump suggested that if he were elected president, he mig", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2015-12-03T032811Z_1_LYNXMPEBB2047_RTROPTP_4_USA-ELECTION-TRUMP-e1449672117665.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou know the great thing about executive orders is that I don\u2019t have to go back to Congress.\n\u201cIn the first 100 days, we\u2019re going to knock the hell out of Obamacare,\u201d Trump declared to his audience\u2019s approval.\nThe order he\u2019s referencing is Obama\u2019s much-contested November 2014 executive order that granted legal status to five million illegal immigrants.\nBesides discussing what he would do in his first 100 days in office, Trump tackled the usual subjects of illegal immigration, China and colorful insults for his Republican rivals.\nMaybe there\u2019s a couple of good ones [Obama policies], I don\u2019t know, I doubt it.\u201d\u201cBut we\u2019re going to be unsigning a lot of executive orders, especially his [Obama\u2019s] order that basically lets anybody they want just pour into our country."}
