President Obama, in the wake of an Iran nuclear deal that’s already sparked the ire of

conservatives on Capitol Hill and around the nation, suggested those criticizing him should actually love him because he took a page out of the playbook of one of the GOP’s most revered, former President Ronald Reagan.

“You know,” he said, the New York Times reported. “I have a lot of differences with Ronald Reagan, but where I completely admire him was his recognition that if you were able to verify an agreement that [was forged] with the evil empire that was hellbent on our destruction and was a far greater existential threat to us than Iran

will ever be,” then it’s a worthwhile pursuit.

His hearkening to Reagan seemed to be an attempt to underscore his own insistence that the Iran nuclear deal included around-the-clock verification procedures – a mimic of Reagan’s own “trust but verify” approach to dealings with foreign nations. Several pundits and analysts have called the Iran deal shaky on the verification, however, because it reportedly allows Tehran to delay inspectors’ access to sites for up to 24 days, various media outlets said.

Obama also compared himself to former President Richard Nixon, saying that while he “had a lot of disagreements with Richard Nixon,” at least that president “understood there was the prospect, the possibility, that China could take a different path,” the New York Times reported.
