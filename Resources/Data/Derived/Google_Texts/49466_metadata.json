So far, federal officials said that only Hillary Clinton, has a federal security detail, as she has lifelong protection as a former first lady.The price tag could mount quickly to provide details for candidates, according to Basham, who told The Post that it will cost more than $40,000 a day to protect just one candidate.Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson will meet with a panel of congressional leaders to determine when Secret Service details will be made available and to whom.There are guidelines , though, before a detail is assigned. Candidates must be active in at least 10 primaries, score high in polls, and have contributions of at least $10 million.But not all candidates will need paid security details, as sitting governors Scott Walker, Chris Christie, John Kasich, and Bobby Jindal already have full-time security teams who are paid from state funds.Trump's campaign would not say if the latest incident with Schiller will lead to a decision to bring a Secret Service team in to handle his security, and it's even possible that he may keep his own team in place, like Ross Perot did in 1992.But Basham said that would not make sense, as the Secret Service \"has a lot more resources available, even for someone with Donald Trump\u2019s money.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "trump, secret service,
