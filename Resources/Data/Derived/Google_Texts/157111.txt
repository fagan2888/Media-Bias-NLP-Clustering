ST. LOUIS — Semyon Varlamov will start in goal Monday night as the Avalanche concludes its five-game road trip at the Scottrade Center, where they’ll face the St. Louis Blues for their fifth and final regular-season matchup.

The Avs are 1-1-2 on the trip. Varlamov, who has played three of the previous four games, will oppose St. Louis goalie Brian Elliott, the one-time Avs palyer who leads the NHL with a 1.90 goals-against average.

“I thought we played really well in both games in Florida, against the Panthers and Lightning,” Avs coach Patrick Roy said Monday of his team’s last two games. “We were solid and I believe we’ve played three pretty good games out of four, and we’re at .500 hockey. I’d like to be ahead of that but the way we’re playing, hopefully we’ll (finish above).

“To beat these guys, we’ll have to be solid in all three zones. Offensively we’ll have to go to the net, place the puck behind their D and get our forecheck going. The forecheck, in my opinion, will be the key.”

Matt Duchene will continue to center Alex Tanguay and Jarome Iginla, and Ryan O’Reilly will center Gabe Landeskog and Nathan MacKinnon. The Avs’ lone healthy scratch will be defenseman Zach Redmond, who has not played in the previous 10 games.

“Tough little stretch here and this is a big game,” Duchene said after the morning skate. “We all said before the road trip that when you go on a trip like this you want to be over .500, and we can do that (Monday night) with a win. It feels like we’ve played these guys every other day lately. But we know what to expect, they know what to expect. They’re a team we have a good rivalry with.”

Colorado is 1-1-2 against the Blues, losing in a shootout, in overtime and regulation (3-0 on Dec. 29 at St. Louis). The last meeting was perhaps the Avs’ worst game of the season; they posted just 16 shots on third-string goalie Martin Brodeur.
