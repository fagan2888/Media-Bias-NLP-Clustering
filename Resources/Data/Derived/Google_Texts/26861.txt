Coldplay, "A Head Full of Dreams" (Parlophone/Atlantic)

Get out your disco ball. Coldplay has dabbled with dance music before but on the band's new set, "A Head Full of Dreams," Chris Martin and co. have gone full tilt.

While still recognizable for its sweeping, ambitious anthems, this is Coldplay with 50 percent more twirl. Credit (or blame) Norwegian production duo Stargate, best known for its work with Beyonce, Rihanna and Katy Perry, who co-produced the set and put the extra pep in Coldplay's step.

And speaking of Beyonce, she opens the lilting "Hymn for the Weekend," which also features programming by Avicii. Swedish sensation Tove Lo drops by on "Fun," a song about Martin's conscious uncoupling from Gwyneth Paltrow that puts a positive glow on their split. To further prove there are no hard feelings, Paltrow sings on "Everglow," a bittersweet ballad about the ties that bind even after the marital cord has been cut.

All the wistful bonhomie becomes a bit precious on "Birds," which cuts off mid-song, and on "Kaleidoscope," which features a spoken-word recitation by poet Coleman Barks that encourages welcoming the awareness life's changes bring. Lyrically, Martin strives to find the silver lining in every disappointment, especially on the feel-good album closer "Up&Up."

And if you can dance to it, all the better, as the British quartet will undoubtedly prove when it headlines the Super Bowl 50 halftime show on Feb. 7.
