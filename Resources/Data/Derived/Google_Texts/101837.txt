During a light-hearted Thanksgiving segment on the annual White House tradition of pardoning a turkey, correspondent Jeanne Moos concluded with a harmless joke aimed at the horrendous Obamacare website. The subtle jab resulted in an interesting reaction from CNN anchor Carol Costello that has several media outlets speculating.

The White House has set up an online voting website where Americans can vote on which turkey, Caramel or Popcorn, will be pardoned this Thanksgiving.

“The people will decide whether Popcorn or Caramel gets the glory this year,” Moos narrated. “At least this government website is working. It’s no turkey.”

At hearing the joke, Costello let out a loud sigh and responded with a smile: “I don’t know if that bolstered your argument, Jeanne, but hey, Happy Thanksgiving.”

Of course, no one can know for sure if she took offense to the Obamacare joke or if was simply unamused by the somewhat cheesy pun.

As Mediaite’s Tommy Christopher puts it, “Costello’s reaction is interesting in that it can act as a sort of Rorschach test for CNN viewers, who can decide whether she was taking offense at a gratuitous shot at Obamacare, or making a comment on the trivialization of such a serious issue, or simply making an affectionate nod to the joke’s cheese factor.”

Do you think people are reading too much into the sigh?
