It is projected to run out of money this year as it faces a $13 billion deficit.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, \u201cRepublicans from both chambers said they expected Congress to approve the legislation next week.\u201d\n\nRep. Bill Shuster, R-Pa., chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, introduced a bill that would extend the Highway Trust Fund through July 31.\n\nShuster and Ryan said in a joint statement that \u201cwhile highway and transit program spending authority expires at the end of the month, the Highway Trust Fund has sufficient resources to fund its obligations through the end of July.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was our preference to move an extension through the end of the year, but we will need more time to reach a bipartisan agreement on offsets,\u201d they said. \u201cThis legislation will allow transportation spending to continue through July, while we work towards a next step to close the Trust Fund\u2019s shortfall. Doing so will require our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to be constructive in working towards a solution. Only then will we be able to produce a plan that gives states the certainty they need to build the roads, bridges, and other infrastructure our communities and economy need to thrive.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, White House principal deputy press secretary Eric Schultz told reporters that it would be a \u201cdereliction of responsibility\u201d for lawmakers to leave town without passing at least a short-term extension.\n\n>>> Your Federal Gas Taxes Pay For This Program. Congress Will Decide Its Financial Future.\n\nIn a recent report, Michael Sargent, a research assistant at The Heritage Foundation, wrote that \u201cthe current method of investing in infrastructure through the Highway Trust Fund is not working.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongress not only has chosen to spend more than the fund receives in revenue, but is increasingly spending it on projects that are far outside of the federal purview. Local streetcar and bike path projects, while not inherently imprudent, should not be constructed using federal tax dollars collected from motorists.\u201d\n\nSargent suggested leaving more infrastructure decisions to the states.\n\n\u201cInstead, Congress should strengthen the nation\u2019s highways in a fiscally responsible way by limiting spending and ending diversions to projects that are not federal priorities. Even better, Congress should minimize the federal government\u2019s role in transportation spending, leaving states to decide how best to invest in the infrastructure that their citizens deem most necessary,\u201d he concluded.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lawmakers have introduced a bill in the House of Representatives that would extend the authorization of the Highway Trust Fund until the end of July.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Lawmakers have introduced a bill in the House of Representatives that would extend the authorization of the Highway Trust Fund until the end of July.", "title": "Lawmakers Propose Short-Term Extension for Highway Trust Fund", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150518_HighwayTrustFund.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1PurtWG"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Lawmakers have introduced a bill in the House of Representatives that would extend the authorization of the Highway Trust Fund until the end of July.", "title": "Lawmakers Propose Short-Term Extension for Highway Trust Fund", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150518_HighwayTrustFund.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "transportation", "published_time": "2015-05-18T22:24:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Highway, Highway Trust Fund, gas tax, infrastructure, Paul Ryan, Bill Shuster"}, "article_summary": "The Highway Trust Fund finances federal highway and transportation projects, and is funded by the federal tax on gas and diesel fuel.\nUnlikely to reach an agreement by the end of the month, Republican lawmakers have introduced a bill in the House of Representatives that would temporarily extend the authorization of the Highway Trust Fund until the end of July.\n\u201cThis legislation will allow transportation spending to continue through July, while we work towards a next step to close the Trust Fund\u2019s shortfall.\nThe authorization for the fund expires at the end of May, but it has sufficient resources to last for two more months.\n\u201cInstead, Congress should strengthen the nation\u2019s highways in a fiscally responsible way by limiting spending and ending diversions to projects that are not federal priorities."}
