Despite the progress we've made in vaccines, drugs, and sanitation, infectious diseases—a category that includes everything from the run-of-the-mill flu to antibiotic-resistant "superbugs"—still kill some 170,00 Americans each year.

But most states—33, to be exact—have taken fewer than half of the recommended steps to prevent the spread of diseases such as whooping cough, HIV, and hospital infections, according to a new report the Trust for America’s Health, a nonprofit that works to prevent outbreaks, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a public health philanthropy.

The factors the report authors judged the states on include vaccinating for diseases like flu, measles, HPV, and whooping cough; controlling hospital-acquired infections; screening people for HIV; preparing for climate change and disease outbreaks; and adequately funding their public health departments. States scored one point for each measure they met.

"Three states tied for the lowest score, achieving two out of 10 possible indicators—Georgia, Nebraska and New Jersey. New Hampshire had the highest score, with 8 out of 10," they found.
