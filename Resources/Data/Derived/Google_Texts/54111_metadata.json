It is being brought in federal court in Birmingham by Blue Cross subscribers and health care providers against about three dozen Blues from around the country, including Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama, which has one of the largest market shares of any insurer in the country.\n\nThe Blue Cross businesses are independent, but are linked by the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association with a board of directors. The lawsuit alleges that the board sets up anti-competitive agreements allowing the companies to carve up geographic markets in an illegal way.\n\nThe association, speaking for the Blues named in the lawsuit, has vigorously denied the allegations.\n\n\"We believe that the plaintiffs' amended complaint is as meritless as the original, and we look forward to the opportunity to present our case as the litigation moves forward,\" said association spokesman Caleb Weaver. \"The Blue system does not prevent any of our competitors from selling insurance in Alabama or anywhere else a Blue plan offers coverage, either as part of our traditional plans or through one of the exchanges established under the ACA. We welcome all competition, including competition to coverage offered through the ACA-created exchanges, which are governed by rules and regulations that apply to all insurers equally.\"\n\nWeaver also said in the emailed statement that the complaint related to executive compensation is \"similarly without a factual or legal basis.\"\n\nIn addition to the example of Alabama executive pay, the lawsuit alleges that members of the board of BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina \"made up of prominent lawyers, bankers and development and business leaders earned between $100,000 and $160,000 for board duties.\n\n\"They were required to do little but show up to the occasional meeting,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\nIn South Carolina, the executives made \"in the millions,\" the suit alleges.\n\nPreviously a Blue Cross spokesman said salaries and premium prices are not related, prompting plaintiff's lawyer Joe Whatley to respond, \"Where is Blue Cross of Alabama saying it got the money to pay the substantial increases in salaries ... Maybe the tooth fairy instead of premiums.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "blue cross and blue shield, news", "title": "High executive pay at Blue Cross results in higher consumer costs, lawsuit alleges", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "BIRMINGHAM, Alabama - A new filing in a class action antitrust lawsuit alleging Blue Cross companies of conspiring in Alabama and across the country to illegally stifle competition says high executive pay results in higher costs to consumers.
