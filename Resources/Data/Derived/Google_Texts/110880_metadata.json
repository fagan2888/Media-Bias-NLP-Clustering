That\u2019s why Quicksilver will likely be back for X-Men: Apocalypse, but could he even get his own solo film?\n\nEvan Peters\u2019 quick-witted and even quicker-footed Quicksilver had what\u2019s generally agreed to be the breakout scene in all of X-Men: Days of Future Past. In fact, Quicksilver seemed so useful that fans of the movie have pointed out he should have been used more. As in: he could have solved all of the X-Men\u2019s problems in literally the blink of an eye.\n\nExecutives that worked on the film, though, excuse away their underuse of Quicksilver by saying that the thing that really needed saving in Days of Future Past was Mystique\u2019s soul. That\u2019s pretty lame as far as plot-hole patching goes, but Days of Future Past\u2018s box office haul means nobody really cared.\n\nQuicksilver\u2019s popularity in the most recent X-Men flick may have secured the actor that played him some future work, as well. Speaking this week with Newsarama, Days of Future Past second unit director Brian Smrz confirmed that the mutant speedster will in fact be back on the screen when the X-Men take on their greatest foe to date, the powerful Apocalypse.\n\n\u201cWell, there will be another Quicksilver scene,\u201d Smrz said when asked what he was looking forward to with X-Men: Apocalypse, \u201cwhich I\u2019m looking forward to; that\u2019ll be fun.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a lot to go on, because Fox of course is playing everything close to the vest. It does confirm that Quicksilver will play a role when the X-Men take on Apocalypse, but he\u2019s just one of several characters fans would love to see when the mutants take the screen again.\n\nMeanwhile, the Quicksilver information is one of the only solid details we\u2019ve gotten so far on X-Men: Apocalypse. More recently, there\u2019s been the (frankly awful) rumor that Tom Hardy, who played Bane in The Dark Knight Rises, was in the running to take on the role of millennia-old Egyptian En Sabah Nur, the eponymous Apocalypse for the next X-Men film. One hopes that that rumor doesn\u2019t pan out, but it\u2019s one of the few rumors to hit the web so far.\n\nAt the very least, it looks like we\u2019ll be getting another Quicksilver sequence or two for X-Men: Apocalypse, and Smrz said he\u2019d actually be interested in a Quicksilver solo flick if the stars aligned right. Just don\u2019t hold your breath for that one, though.\n\n\u201cWe talked about Quicksilver before,\u201d Smrz said, \u201cI\u2019d love to do a Quicksilver as a solo film because there\u2019s a lot to enjoy with that character. But I\u2019m not geared just towards superhero movies; for me it\u2019s about great main characters, and finding movies that have that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Quicksilver, the silver-haired speedster in X-Men: Days of Future Past, was one of the standouts of the most ambitious X-Men feature to date -- and Fox knows it", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Quicksilver, the silver-haired speedster in X-Men: Days of Future Past, was one of the standouts of the most ambitious X-Men feature to date \u2014 and Fox knows it", "title": "Quicksilver\u2019s Coming Back For \u2018X-Men: Apocalypse\u2019 \u2026 And Maybe A Solo Film?", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/1554821/quicksilvers-coming-back-for-x-men-apocalypse-and-maybe-a-solo-film/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/quicksilver-days-future-past-x-men-apocalypse-141023-670x409.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-23T16:44:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-23T19:51:40+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/quicksilver-days-future-past-x-men-apocalypse-141023-670x409.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2014-10-23T16:44:31+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "fox,marvel,quicksilver,x-men,x-men apocalypse,x-men: days of future past,entertainment,movies", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/quicksilver-days-future-past-x-men-apocalypse-141023-670x409.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Quicksilver, the silver-haired speedster in X-Men: Days of Future Past, was one of the standouts of the most ambitious X-Men feature to date \u2014 and Fox knows it"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1385\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s why Quicksilver will likely be back for X-Men: Apocalypse, but could he even get his own solo film?\nMeanwhile, the Quicksilver information is one of the only solid details we\u2019ve gotten so far on X-Men: Apocalypse.\nQuicksilver, the silver-haired speedster in X-Men: Days of Future Past, was one of the standouts of the most ambitious X-Men feature to date \u2014 and Fox knows it.\nEvan Peters\u2019 quick-witted and even quicker-footed Quicksilver had what\u2019s generally agreed to be the breakout scene in all of X-Men: Days of Future Past.\n\u201cWe talked about Quicksilver before,\u201d Smrz said, \u201cI\u2019d love to do a Quicksilver as a solo film because there\u2019s a lot to enjoy with that character."}
