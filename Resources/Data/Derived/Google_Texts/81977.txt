Richard Koo, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute, says the Federal Reserve must act early or else it will have to abruptly tighten policy.

The market may believe the U.S. Federal Reserve moved too quickly on raising interest rates last year, but the chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute offers a reason why they had to act when they did.

"The fundamental starting point is that the central bank that did the quantitative easing (QE) will have to move faster than the central bank that didn't do QE," Richard Koo, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute, told CNBC.

With no academic or theoretical work around on when was the right time to raise interest rates after QE, Koo said that if the Fed had a choice to raise rates too early or too late, they'd rather be ahead of the curve.

For the first time in almost 10 years, the U.S. Federal Reserve decided to raise its benchmark policy rate last December, to between 0.25 to 0.5 percent.
