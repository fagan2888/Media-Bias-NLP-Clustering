Many of these measures were Targeted Regulations of Abortion Providers (TRAP) laws, restrictions that apply only to abortion providers, which \u201cinterfere with patients\u2019 personal decision-making, and ultimately block access to abortion care.\u201d The report, which details the impact of every anti-abortion bill introduced in states this year, is straightforward in describing what it sees as the motivations behind the bills: \u201cThe ultimate goal of these politicians is to criminalize women\u2019s health services one by one until no safe, legal options are available to any woman who makes the decision to end a pregnancy.\u201d From MTV News: Many of these bills \u2014 most of which appeared in southern states \u2014 were aimed at defunding Planned Parenthood or banning fetal tissue research as a result of those fake videos claiming to show that the women\u2019s health organization illegally sold fetal tissue for a profit (a claim that has been repeatedly disproven). Other bills proposed clinic regulations so difficult to follow that they\u2019d likely force the few remaining clinics in southern states to close. Still others created mandatory waiting periods or state-sanctioned \u201ccounseling\u201d for women seeking an abortion \u2014 both medically unnecessary measures that are generally aimed at shaming women and suggesting that they\u2019re incapable of making their own choices. Arkansas passed a bill requiring women to wait 48 hours between an initial consultation and an abortion procedure, and North Carolina and Oklahoma both increased their mandatory waiting periods to 72 hours \u2014 the longest waiting period in the country. Texas, which has already made it nearly impossible for clinics providing abortion care to remain open in the state, passed a new law \u201cexplicitly targeting minors, undocumented women, and low-income women,\u201d according to the report. One of the measures in the Texas bill forces all adult patients to provide a photo ID, ostensibly to prove that they are not a minor. The report explains that \u201cThis \u2019abortion ID\u2019 requirement could serve as a backdoor ban on undocumented women and low-income women from obtaining abortion care,\u201d and notes that the bill also makes it virtually impossible for abused and neglected Texas teens to receive abortion care in the event that they can\u2019t obtain parental consent. The Supreme Court hasn\u2019t heard a case related to abortion rights since 2007, but in late June, the court is expected to hear a case regarding some of the measures included in Texas\u2019s HB2 laws, which have forced most of the state\u2019s clinics to close since it passed in 2013. As a recent report from The Nation notes, \u201cThe ruling could help roll back other state laws aimed at narrowing abortion access \u2014 or it could sanction the campaign to make abortion effectively, if not legally, unobtainable.\u201d Read more here. \u2014Posted by Roisin Davis More Below the Ad Advertisement Square, Site wide Get truth delivered to\n\nyour inbox every week.\n\n\n\nNew and Improved Comments If you have trouble leaving a comment, review this help page.
