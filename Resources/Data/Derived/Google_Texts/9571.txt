Fund-raising for private equity investments in Brazil appears set to pick up after two lean years, although currency volatility and a still weak economy have some funds thinking twice about plunging money into companies.

Three major investment firms– Gávea Investimentos of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co, Patria Investimentos and the Carlyle Group–have started raising capital to invest in Brazilian companies, according to people familiar with the firms’ plans. The three firms declined to comment on their fund-raising activities.
