Sioux Falls, SD

A fierce cross-town rivalry is putting their competition on the line to help feed South Dakota's hungry families this week.

Starting this weekend, you'll find barrels at five Sioux Falls HyVee stores to benefit those in need.

In collaboration with the University of Sioux Falls, Augustana College students helped organize a food drive to benefit Feeding South Dakota.

"If you give people a chance to help other people, they are going to take it. But you just need someone to give them that chance. Making the opportunity this easy for them was a lot of fun," Heiberger said.

Students, alumni and fans are encouraged to drop food in the bin corresponding with their school. The students got the idea after more than 36,000 pounds of food were donated in a competition drive between SDSU and USD last fall.

The rivalry in Sioux Falls is expected to remain fierce in the food drive.

"If you get any colleges within almost a block or two from each other, the competition is going to rise," Heiberger said. "Especially when they are two private schools about the same size."

"The competition used to be slightly more violent than it is now," Ryan Bjorklund said, a University of Sioux Falls junior. "Now it is a lot of fun and a great time. We have a lot of fun with Augustana.

Every donation is needed. At the Sioux Falls Food Pantry, they are seeing more people come through their doors than they ever have before.

"We have distributed close to 200,000 more pounds of food this last year than previous years," Feeding South Dakota's John Geyer said. "We are helping fill that need but it is still consistent that the need is still climbing."
