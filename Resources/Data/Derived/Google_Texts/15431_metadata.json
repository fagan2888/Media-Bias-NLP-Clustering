Simmons said one of its key details, the eye drilled through, came to him in a dream.\n\nYears ago, structural engineer John Paul Huguley had breakfast at Saffron\u2019s with the legendary Charleston blacksmith Philip Simmons.\n\nSimmons, who passed away in 2009, shared with Huguley his biggest wish.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Before I die, I want to make sure my trade is carried on,\u2019 \u201d Huguley recalls clearly.\n\nIt ultimately led to Huguley\u2019s efforts to found the School of the Building Arts, the Charleston institution now known as the American College of the Building Arts. He calls Simmons \u201cmy inspirational founder.\u201d\n\nAnd this year, that breakfast conversation is coming full circle as an instructor at that college is helping to restore one of Simmons\u2019 most significant set of gates, the ones featuring a pair of coiled rattlesnakes.\n\nThe gates are a key feature of the house at 329 East Bay St., which is just next door to where Huguley and Simmons had their fateful breakfast.\n\nThe house is far older, and its historical significance stems both from its ties to Christopher Gadsden, a Revolutionary War hero who once owned this land and whose son-in-law is believed to have built the house around 1800.\n\nA Gadsden descendant donated the house to the Historic Charleston Foundation in 1959, and it became one of the foundation\u2019s first successes in its revolving fund that helped preserve many Ansonborough homes.\n\nSimmons designed the gates after that, in collaboration with Samuel Stoney, who was with the foundation.\n\nThe snake detail is a riff on the \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d flag that Gadsden designed during the American Revolution and whose yellow background and coiled rattlesnake continue to reverberate as a political symbol today.\n\nStoney and Simmons discussed the snake detail, which is in a circle near the top of each gate, in depth, and Stoney told Simmons not to install it until they both agreed on the snake\u2019s final design, says Rossie Colter of the Philip Simmons Foundation.\n\nAnd then the solution came to Simmons in a dream, she says, \u201cand he woke up in the morning and put the hole in his eye.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the gates are considered among Simmons\u2019 most significant and they were among his favorites, a milestone of his evolution as an artist.\n\nWhile much of their design features the traditional bars and curves historically found in the city\u2019s wrought iron, Simmons\u2019 use of a drill to create the snakes\u2019 eyes shows him adding his own unique artistic touch.\n\nWhen Stoney saw it, Colter recalls, \u201cMr. Stoney said, \u2018Ooh! I think it will bite me!\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe house is currently being renovated as an event space by Luxury Simplified and King Street Commercial, and the gates are getting a high level of attention as they will be a key focal point.\n\nWhile wrought iron might seem like the most indestructible feature on the city\u2019s buildings, it needs maintenance and care, too, and these gates are no exception, says Frank Verga, a blacksmith now teaching at the college.\n\nThere\u2019s the failing pivots where the gates are anchored into the ground, and the upper journal hinges have sagged, too. It appears that someone drove their car into one of the gates, bending it by an inch or so. And there are rusty spots from poor previous repairs and failing paint.\n\nSoon, Verga and his team will remove the gates, which weigh about 500 pounds each, strip them of their paint and repair them much like Simmons would have.\n\nAnd while they do, they will get a close-up chance to savor the expertise of the man who, more than anyone, would be elated that they\u2019re continuing his craft.\n\nAnd they will particularly admire Simmons\u2019 pair of snakes.\n\n\u201cAnyone can make something nice,\u201d Verga says, \u201cbut if they can make me two or four of these things that match, that\u2019s the difference between the professional and someone who is just tinkering with the craft.\u201d\n\nReach Robert Behre at 937-5771.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Philip Simmons gets his last wish, Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nHome & Garden, \r\nRobert Behre, \r\nRobert Behre, 329 East Bay St.,Charleston,Christopher Gadsden,Don't Tread on Me,Frank Verga,Historic Charleston Foundation,Historic preservation,King Street Commercial,Luxury Simplified,Philip Simmons,wrought iron", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Years ago, structural engineer John Paul Huguley had breakfast at Saffron's with the legendary Charleston blacksmith Philip Simmons.", "title": "Philip Simmons gets his last wish", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150207/150209515/philip-simmons-gets-his-last-wish", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150207/PC1207/150209515/AR/0/AR-150209515.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150207/PC1207/150209515/AR/0/AR-150209515.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Years ago, structural engineer John Paul Huguley had breakfast at Saffron's with the legendary Charleston blacksmith Philip Simmons.", "title": "Philip Simmons gets his last wish", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150207/PC1207/150209515/AR/0/AR-150209515.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150209515}}, "keywords": "Philip Simmons gets his last wish , Features, \r\nFeaturesFP LatestNews, \r\nHome & Garden, \r\nRobert Behre, \r\nRobert Behre, 329 East Bay St.,Charleston,Christopher Gadsden,Don't Tread on Me,Frank Verga,Historic Charleston Foundation,Historic preservation,King Street Commercial,Luxury Simplified,Philip Simmons,wrought iron", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-07T13:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-02-06T16:54:00Z", "author": "Robert Behre"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Years ago, structural engineer John Paul Huguley had breakfast at Saffron's with the legendary Charleston blacksmith Philip Simmons."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe608f\"", "article_summary": "The rattlesnake detail in Philip Simmons\u2019 Gadsden House gate is based on the snake in Christopher Gadsden\u2019s well-known \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d flag.\nYears ago, structural engineer John Paul Huguley had breakfast at Saffron\u2019s with the legendary Charleston blacksmith Philip Simmons.\nStoney and Simmons discussed the snake detail, which is in a circle near the top of each gate, in depth, and Stoney told Simmons not to install it until they both agreed on the snake\u2019s final design, says Rossie Colter of the Philip Simmons Foundation.\nSimmons, who passed away in 2009, shared with Huguley his biggest wish.\nSimmons said one of its key details, the eye drilled through, came to him in a dream."}
