Facing questions about the book\u2019s content, Smith has recently sought to distance himself from its coauthor.\n\nA collection of Smith\u2019s essays and Derek Hess\u2019 artwork criticizing George W. Bush\u2019s foreign and domestic policies, \u201cPlease God Save Us\u201d contains violent imagery comparing Republicans \u2014 Christians, in particular \u2014 to Nazis.\n\n\u201cThe Republichrist is leading the charge to war with a \u2018Crosstika\u2019 staff (half swastika, half cross). It\u2019s designed to create blind faith and allegiance, much as the swastika was used by Nazi Germany,\u201d explains the caption of a Hess piece titled \u201cRepublichrist Jihad Devil.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cCrosstika\u201d appears on the book\u2019s cover and throughout \u201cPlease God Save Us.\u201d Other pieces from Hess include a red elephant being crucified, a row of elephant heads on spikes in front of the White House and a dog ripping the throat from a fox bearing the Fox News logo.\n\n\u201cThe art depicts the country\u2019s mood at that point,\u201d Smith told Cleveland NBC affiliate WKYC 3 in a mid-September interview. \u201cI\u2019m responsible for zero of the artwork.\u201d\n\nAnd according to Northeast Ohio Media Group at Cleveland.com, Smith \u201csaid he was not responsible for the book\u2019s artwork and he and the artist completed the book separately.\u201d\n\nSmith\u2019s campaign failed to respond to a Watchdog.org inquiry seeking comment.\n\nBut Smith had probably seen much of the art included in \u201cPlease God Save Us\u201d when he undertook the project with Hess.\n\nA 2008 Detroit Metro Times story noted the book was \u201cborn out of\u201d a 2006 Hess display called \u201cPlease God Save Us From Your Followers.\u201d Smith acknowledged as much in the book\u2019s introduction.\n\n\u201cThe purpose of this publication is to memorialize and explain the artwork of Derek Hess as it was displayed on December 15, 2006,\u201d Smith wrote.\n\n\u201cInternationally known artist Derek Hess and Cleveland area politician Kent Smith test the minds and ideals of the nation with, \u2018Please God Save Us\u2019 a politically charged book that takes Hess\u2019 infamous pieces from the gallery wall and pairs them with Smith\u2019s witty rants,\u201d says the book\u2019s jacket.\n\n\u201cNeither the art nor the words claim to be fair and balanced; just factual and correct,\u201d Smith\u2019s introduction explains. \u201cHess\u2019s goal of the art-opening was to challenge the complacent and the undecided; this publication takes it a step further \u2014 we want you to be convinced.\u201d\n\nThe book was released in mid-2008, specifically because Smith and Hess \u201cknew they had to get it out before the presidential election.\u201d After the election, Hess distributed free Obama posters with copies of the book.\n\nSmith, head of the Democratic Party in Euclid and a former school board member, has used \u201cPlease God Save Us\u201d as a selling point for his candidacy in Ohio House District 8.\n\nSmith discusses \u201cPlease God Save Us\u201d in the biography on his campaign website. A separate page of his campaign site is dedicated to reviews of the book, and his campaign\u2019s only blog post begins with a paragraph about the book.\n\n\u201cNo one is challenging what I\u2019ve written. That\u2019s because they haven\u2019t read it,\u201d Smith told WKYC 3 last week, adding, \u201cMy GOP Tea Party opponents are offended by this book because it\u2019s about them.\u201d\n\nSmith is endorsed by Rep. Armond Budish \u2014 the Democrat former House speaker who holds the 8th District seat Smith seeks \u2014 and by the Cleveland Plain Dealer, a subsidiary of Northeast Ohio Media Group. Budish is running for Cuyahoga County executive.\n\nIn a Cleveland.com comment thread following the outlet\u2019s story about \u201cPlease God Save Us,\u201d NEOMG reporter Jackie Borchardt admitted she had not read the book.\n\nFollowing are several excerpts from Smith\u2019s essays in the book:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Euclid Democrat Kent Smith touts his 2008 book, \"Please God Save Us,\" as proof of his qualifications to serve in the Ohio House.", "title": "Ohio candidate cowrote book comparing Republicans to Nazis", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/please-god-save-us-300px.jpg", "url": "http://watchdog.org/172544/ohio-democrat-wrote-book-comparing-republicans-to-nazis/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "tag": "Armond Budish,Cleveland Plain Dealer,Derek Hess,Euclid,Kent Smith,Northeast Ohio Media Group,Ohio House,Ohio House District 8,Please God Save Us,WKYC 3", "published_time": "2014-09-29T09:13:40+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Euclid Democrat Kent Smith touts his 2008 book, \"Please God Save Us,\" as proof of his qualifications to serve in the Ohio House.", "creator": "@jasonahart", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/please-god-save-us-300px.jpg"}, "title": "Ohio candidate cowrote book comparing Republicans to Nazis", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Euclid Democrat Kent Smith touts his 2008 book, \"Please God Save Us,\" as proof of his qualifications to serve in the Ohio House."}, "article_summary": "By Jason Hart | Ohio WatchdogEuclid Democrat Kent Smith touts his 2008 book, \u201cPlease God Save Us,\u201d as proof of his qualifications to serve in the Ohio House.\nA collection of Smith\u2019s essays and Derek Hess\u2019 artwork criticizing George W.
