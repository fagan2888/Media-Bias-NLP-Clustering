He has done that throughout his career, but his approach is different now. Maniacal intensity has been replaced by a more thoughtful, though still sweat-soaked, session.\n\nThere are a lot of things different about the Rockies\u2019 29-year-old all-star shortstop these days, most notably his conviction to playing smarter, training better and adhering to a strict body maintenance plan borrowed from tennis great Novak Djokovic.\n\nThose changes are a central reason why Tulo heads into Tuesday\u2019s All-Star Game in Minneapolis on pace for his best all-round season, with a league-leading average, 21 home runs and an impressive OPS to go with his usual Gold Glove defense. Fans rewarded his play, giving him more votes \u2014 5,349,456 \u2014 than any National League player.\n\nThough the Rockies have collapsed as a team, Tulowitzki has shined.\n\n\u201cEveryone wants to be like Tulo and have those skills, of course,\u201d said Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado. \u201cBut Tulo\u2019s skills are the way they are because he works so hard. The work he puts in is what makes him the best player in the major leagues.\u201d\n\nNow, though, Tulo takes a more disciplined approach to his craft. His postgame cage matches used to have a frenetic pace. If he had a bad night at the plate, he would beat himself up mentally and take his frustration out on a helpless baseball.\n\n\u201cI used to go in there after the game and hit until, well, whenever,\u201d Tulo said. \u201cI would be in there so long, I\u2019d be shaking.\u201d\n\nNow, he takes a few minutes to talk to the media, stretches out his chronically tight leg muscles and then fixes himself a greenish-colored nutrition shake concocted from fruit or kale. Then he\u2019ll enter the batting cage and get to work.\n\n\u201cIf I like my swing, I\u2019ll try to lock it in,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m upset with myself and I try to fix things. It varies. But I\u2019m smarter now, calmer. Now I make it a point to get my shake and refuel.\u201d\n\nSince bursting onto the major-league scene in 2007 and helping lead the Rockies to the World Series, Tulo has battled leg injuries. His 2008 season was marred when he tore a tendon in his left quadriceps, forcing him to miss 46 games. He played just 47 games in 2012, sidelined by a left groin injury that led to season-ending surgery.\n\nChange for the good\n\nTulowitzki\u2019s critics call him fragile, a label he despises. But the irony is that the multiple injuries he has endured led Tulo to radically change his routine. It\u2019s turned out to be blessing wrapped in an ice pack.\n\n\u201cWe are a little bit more than halfway through the season, so you don\u2019t want to get carried away and jinx yourself, but so far, so good,\u201d Tulowitzki said. \u201cMore than anything else, it\u2019s satisfying to me that I have put in all of this work and it has not only kept me healthy, but I feel like I have been a better player than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d\n\nTulowitzki\u2019s daily routine involves hours of scripted workouts, video study, stretching and a postgame plunge into an ice bath. At home, he often sleeps in a hyperbaric chamber, where the rich oxygen atmosphere helps him recover, soothing aches and pains.\n\nTulo adds, quickly, that his wife, Danyll, \u201cunderstands that it\u2019s part of my job, during the season.\u201d\n\nThe shortstop based a significant part of his regimen on a plan developed by Djokovic, the 27-year-old Serb who this month beat Roger Federer to win Wimbledon and gain the world\u2019s No. 1 ranking. Tulowitzki read Djokovic\u2019s book, \u201cServe to Win,\u201d which is part biography and part nutritional guide, late last season and began a new diet and workout plan in the offseason. Djokovic espouses a strict gluten-free, dairy-free, low-sugar diet.\n\n\u201cI try to stick to that diet,\u201d Tulo said. \u201cIt\u2019s helped me with my energy and my conditioning. I think there are a lot of similarities between a shortstop and a tennis player. There is a lot of lateral movement and quickness. And it\u2019s tough on the body.\u201d\n\nPlus, the 6-foot-2 Djokovic, like the 6-3 Tulowitzki, is a tall man excelling in a sport that requires great dexterity.\n\nRockies trainer Keith Dugger said Tulo can be \u201cstubborn as heck\u201d about changing something such as diet or his workout routine, but adds, \u201cWhen he finally buys into something, he dives in 100 percent.\u201d\n\nDugger applauds the changes the four-time all-star has made.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of getting older. He\u2019s matured,\u201d Dugger said. \u201cHe\u2019s taken ownership of not just his body, but the way he approaches things. I think that\u2019s taken some of the pressure off him. He\u2019s not trying to meet other\u2019s expectations. He\u2019s not worried about perceptions. That\u2019s off him now.\u201d\n\nTip of cap to discipline\n\nColorado manager Walt Weiss knows a thing or two about playing shortstop and the grind baseball can be. A former all-star who played 14 major-league seasons, he tips his cap to Tulowitzki\u2019s steadfastness this season.\n\n\u201cTulo is incredibly disciplined,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to be great without discipline, and he\u2019s an example of that. He does everything in his power to stay on the field.\u201d\n\nGiven Tulo\u2019s injury history, he gets prescribed days off, and if he feels tightness in his groin, he will ease up on the bases or take a day or two off. He has missed just two games this season due to injury.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told myself, \u2018If you\u2019re going to get hurt again, make sure you have covered all of your bases,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThat way you can sit in your chair, be on the DL, look at it and say: \u2018Hey look, I can\u2019t do anything more. This is all I had and I gave it everything I had.\u2019 I can firmly say that now.\n\n\u201cNot only can I say that, it\u2019s helped me stay on the field. And so far it\u2019s been good. There are going to be hiccups here and there with me; it\u2019s just the way that I\u2019m built and it\u2019s just the way that I play. But now I have a system in place.\u201d\n\nTulo acknowledges there are a lot of people who can\u2019t always relate to his tunnel-vision approach. He has a ready answer.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll say: \u2018Why do you put in that much time? That\u2019s all you do 24-7?\u2019 \u201d Tulo said. \u201cBut I know I\u2019m not going to do this forever, so I feel like I want to put everything into it. And then, when my time is over and I\u2019m done playing, I can relax and do whatever the heck I want.\u201d\n\nBy the numbers\n\nTroy Tulowitzki is on pace to set career highs in nearly every offensive category:\n\n.344\n\nBatting average, the best in the major leagues\n\n21\n\nHome runs, tied for first in the National League\n\n.613\n\nSlugging percentage, No. 1 in the National League\n\nT is for terrific\n\nRockies shortstop Troy Tulowitzki is on pace to have his best all-around season this year.
