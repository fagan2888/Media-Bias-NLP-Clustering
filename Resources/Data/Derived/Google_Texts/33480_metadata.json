They have demanded that local ranchers have control of public lands \u2013 not the federal government.\n\nBut days after the occupation began, leaders of the federally recognized Paiute Indian tribe in Burns, the town closest to the refuge, decried the armed occupation, pointing out that the out-of-state militiamen were trying to claim sacred lands that are part of the tribe\u2019s ancestral territory.\n\nThe new video, posted on Wednesday night, has only further enraged tribal leaders who recently called on law enforcement officials to protect native cultural resources at the refuge and to criminally prosecute the militiamen.\n\n\u201cI feel disrespected that they\u2019re even out there,\u201d said Jarvis Kennedy, the tribal council\u2019s sergeant-at-arms. Kennedy said he was too upset to watch all of Finicum\u2019s video. \u201cIt\u2019s like me going through their drawers at their house.\u201d\n\nTribe leaders and federal officials say the refuge stores confidential documents and thousands of historic artifacts, such as baskets, spears, tools and beads. The refuge is also home to Paiute burial grounds, making the militia\u2019s recent decision to pave a road through the refuge particularly alarming.\n\n\u201cI could go to the Bundys where his grandparents are buried,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cHow would they feel if I drove over their grave and went through their heirlooms?\u201d\n\nIn his video, Finicum said that he was showing how the wildlife refuge has done a poor job maintaining the artifacts and keeping storage rooms clean. \u201cThis needs to be taken care of, and so we\u2019re reaching out to the Paiute people in the sincerest manner as we can,\u201d he said on camera. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure that we take care of the heritage of the Native American people.\u201d\n\nAdded militia member Blaine Cooper: \u201cThe rightful owners need to come back and claim their belongings.\u201d\n\nBut Kennedy said the tribe has a good relationship with refuge officials and noted that the Paiute people refuse to communicate with militia leaders or visit the occupation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to give them the satisfaction of meeting with them,\u201d Charlotte Rodrique, chairwoman of the Burns Paiute tribe, told the Guardian last week.\n\nKennedy noted that the militiamen have had no trouble leaving and returning to the refuge and feared one of them might damage or steal their artifacts and documents. \u201cAll the stuff they are doing out there, it\u2019s like a crime scene,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce this is done, we\u2019ll see what\u2019s missing.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2016 Guardian News and Media Limited", "article_metadata": {"description": "Standoff leader posted a video of him looking through artifacts and documents from the Paiute tribe at the Malheur national wildlife refuge, sparking outrage, artifacts, Malhuer militia, militia, Oregon, Paiute,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "The Guardian", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Standoff leader posted a video of him looking through artifacts and documents from the Paiute tribe at the Malheur national wildlife refuge, sparking outrage, artifacts, Malhuer militia, militia, Oregon, Paiute,", "title": "Fresh Outrage After Malhuer Militia Seen Rifling Through Tribal Artifacts At Oregon Refuge", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/fresh-outrage-after-malhuer-militia-seen-rifling-through-tribal-artifacts-at-oregon-refuge/213036/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/920x920.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-22T18:11:09-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Standoff leader posted a video of him looking through artifacts and documents from the Paiute tribe at the Malheur national wildlife refuge, sparking outrage, artifacts, Malhuer militia, militia, Oregon, Paiute,", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/920x920.jpg", "title": "Fresh Outrage After Malhuer Militia Seen Rifling Through Tribal Artifacts At Oregon Refuge", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Paiute", "published_time": "2016-01-23T05:00:27-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-22T18:11:09-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m not going to give them the satisfaction of meeting with them,\u201d Charlotte Rodrique, chairwoman of the Burns Paiute tribe, told the Guardian last week.\nThe militiamen stationed at a federal wildlife refuge in eastern Oregon are now rummaging through artifacts and documents of the Paiute tribe, sparking outrage among local Native Americans whose ancestors originally occupied the land.\nThe refuge is also home to Paiute burial grounds, making the militia\u2019s recent decision to pave a road through the refuge particularly alarming.\nKennedy noted that the militiamen have had no trouble leaving and returning to the refuge and feared one of them might damage or steal their artifacts and documents.\n\u201cI feel disrespected that they\u2019re even out there,\u201d said Jarvis Kennedy, the tribal council\u2019s sergeant-at-arms."}
