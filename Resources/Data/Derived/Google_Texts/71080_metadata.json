Michael \"Mike\" Lee (R-Utah), right, speaks during a news conference with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), following a vote on Sept. 27. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg)\n\nEarly last Wednesday, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) rose in the Senate to recite a quotation from George Washington. It was, Lee said, Washington\u2019s own account of his last day as president in 1797.\n\nLee was explaining why Washington, if he were alive today, might agree with Republicans in the fight that led to the government shutdown.\n\n\u201cI was plain George Washington now, neither general nor president,\u201d Lee said, reading Washington\u2019s account of walking down a Philadelphia street. \u201cSuddenly I realized I was not alone. People were following me. At first only a few, then a swelling crowd. For a long moment, I stood face to face with them \u2014 the young cobbler, the carpenter, the storekeeper, the laborer,\u201d Lee read.\n\nHe concluded with Washington\u2019s point: \u201cOur country rests in good hands, in the hands of its people.\u201d\n\nWashington, Lee explained, believed in the American people. The American people, Lee added, do not like Obamacare. Therefore, it has to go.\n\nScott Clement from The Washington Post's polling team looks at the one number you need to know from the new Washington Post - ABC News Poll on the budget negotiations. (The Washington Post)\n\nLee might be right about Obama\u00adcare \u2014 that depends on your politics, and your polls.\n\nBut he was wrong about what Washington said.\n\n\u201cThis quote from Sen. Mike Lee is not from George Washington,\u201d said Douglas Bradburn, head of the new George Washington library at Mount Vernon. \u201cIt\u2019s completely apocryphal.\u201d\n\nLee\u2019s office did not respond Tuesday evening to questions about the speech. A spokeswoman said that, because of the shutdown, the office was too busy to reply.\n\nThis has been a busy week for the Founding Fathers. In the debate that led up to the shutdown, legislators name-checked at least three of the Federalist Papers (numbers 45, 57 and 62) and 28 of the 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) alone mentioned 27 signers during his marathon 21-hour speech last week.\n\nThe point, in each case, was that the country\u2019s founders would clearly be on one side in this current fight. Which side, of course, depended on who was talking.\n\nRep. Steve King (R-Iowa), for instance, saw Thomas Jefferson as an obvious opponent of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cLarge initiatives should not be advanced on slender majorities,\u201d King quoted Jefferson as saying (the quote was not exact, but close enough). King continued: \u201c[Jefferson] would have said that large initiatives should never be advanced on partisan majorities. That\u2019s what happened with Obama\u00adcare.\u201d\n\nBut Rep. David Scott (D-Ga.) cited Jefferson in making an opposite argument: that the disagreement over Obamacare was not a reason to shut down the government.\n\n\u201cAlexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson hated each other so much. But that hate that they had for each other did not come before the love of their country,\u201d Scott said. Speaking to Republicans, he continued: \u201cYour hate for this president is coming before the love of this country. Because if you loved this country, you would not be closing it down!\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce again, the chair would ask members to address their remarks to the chair,\u201d said Rep. Doc Hastings (R-Wash.), who was chairing the session. He was reminding Scott of a House rule: Members are not to demean each other directly. Only obliquely.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s always tricky to bring 200-year-old words uttered by long-dead men into modern political fights. The founders never faced the question of an \u201cindividual mandate\u201d to buy health insurance. They never dealt with a wide-scale threat to shut down the government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always anathema to historians, because how could you know what Jefferson would think today?\u201d said Andrew O\u2019Shaughnessy, director of the Robert H. Smith International Center for Jefferson Studies at Monticello.\n\nBut in this situation, O\u2019Shaughnessy said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what historians think.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, Republicans have repeatedly cited James Madison to defend a controversial tactic: withholding funding for the entire government in order to force a weakening of the health-care law.\n\nRep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) cited a passage from Madison\u2019s Federalist No. 58: \u201cThis power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance.\u201d\n\nThat, DeSantis said in a phone interview, means \u201cthe notion that you must always fund everything that happens to be in law is just not true.\u201d Therefore, he said, the Republicans are employing a legitimate tactic in trying to defund Obamacare.\n\nBut even here, the Founding Fathers are inconveniently hard to pin down. Madison went on to say, in effect, that it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone would go so far as to shut down the government. \u201cWill not the House of Representatives be as much interested as the Senate in maintaining the government in its proper functions?\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cOkay, so lemme pull open my Federalist Papers here,\u201d DeSantis said. There was a pause. \u201cHe is cautioning against having an absolute inflexibility. And I concur with that,\u201d DeSantis said. He said that it was not the House but the Democratic Senate that was being inflexible now. They were the ones doing the thing that Madison wouldn\u2019t like.\n\nMike Lee, the senator from Utah, quoted Madison, Jefferson and Washington during speeches on the Senate floor.\n\nHistorians said he got his facts right \u2014 every time but one.\n\n\u201cI can say categorically: Washington never wrote that,\u201d Edward G. Lengel, editor of the George Washington Papers at the University of Virginia, said after reading a transcript of Lee\u2019s speech about Washington\u2019s last day.\n\nSo, if Washington didn\u2019t write the account that Lee read, who did?\n\n\u201cThose words are based very loosely on a passage in my book, \u201cFirst in Their Hearts,\u201d which was published many years ago,\u201d author Thomas Fleming said in an e-mail Tuesday. But the passage in Fleming\u2019s book is in the third person: \u201cHe was plain George Washington now, neither general nor president. . . .\u201d It is not presented as Washington\u2019s own words.\n\n\u201cThe senator puts the words in Washington\u2019s mouth. I do not take such an unwarranted liberty,\u201d Fleming wrote Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress\u2019s armchair historians know just what Madison would say.
