Outside the government building, protesters chanted: \"Revolution, revolution against the system.\"\n\nJust before midnight, the government said it had approved a plan that promises to end the trash crisis.\n\n\"They are feeling the sand shifting under them,\" Elias Nassour, a 28-year-old protester, said of the government leaders. \"Nothing will pass so easily anymore. They can't belittle us anymore.\"\n\nThe trash crisis has ignited the largest Lebanese protests in years and has emerged as a festering symbol of the government's paralysis and failure to provide basic services. It was sparked by popular anger over the heaps of trash accumulating in Beirut's streets after authorities closed the capital's main landfill on July 17 and failed to provide an alternative.\n\nThe protests quickly moved beyond just the trash in the streets to target an entire political class that has dominated the country and undermined its growth since the civil war ended in 1990. Lebanon has a confessional power-sharing system that often leads to incessant bickering and cronyism among the country's politicians.\n\nThousands of people have taken part in huge demonstrations over the past two weeks. Among other things, they are demanding new parliament elections, to be followed by presidential elections.\n\nThe country has been without a president for over a year, and members of parliament have illegally extended their term twice amid disputes over an election law.\n\nAfter meeting for three and a half hours, leaders of Lebanon's various sectarian blocs issued a brief statement, saying the talks would resume in a week.\n\n\"They did not even bother to meet tomorrow or the day after, they postponed it for a week and came out without any decision,\" said Assaad Thebian, an organizer with the main group behind the protests, which calls itself \"You Stink.\"\n\n\"They showed that they are indifferent and should not be in leadership positions,\" he told The Associated Press.\n\n\"This dialogue is a joke. They are meeting to see how they can split the cheese,\" said Marwan Basha, a 57-year-old engineer taking part in the sit-in near parliament, as riot police stood nearby. His T-shirt had Arabic words on the front, asking: \"Where is the water, where is the electricity, where are the job opportunities?\"\n\nOn the barbed wire that separates protesters from the building, activists pinned a large banner with the pictures of the 128 members of parliament reading: \"You have failed at everything ... Go Home.\"\n\nSo far, the only response to the growing protest movement has been a promise by the parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, for the high-level talks among the politicians.\n\nHis call has been backed by the main political leaders, who attended the meeting Wednesday, but it was unclear how such talks among the same veteran politicians being vilified by the protesters would help break the deadlock.\n\nThe leaders are deeply divided over core issues, such as what a new election law would look like, and whether it should be passed before or after a president is elected.\n\nFollowing the meeting, a government official said they discussed the urgent need to elect a president. Adnan Daher said the next dialogue session would be held on Sept. 16.\n\nAt Beirut's main Martyrs' Square, thousands waved red-and-white Lebanese flags and chanted anti-government slogans as night fell.\n\n\"The people want to topple the regime,\" many shouted \u2014 a chant common during the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011.\n\nAhmad Amhaz, a 23-year-old activist who is among eight who have been on a hunger strike for days, called for the resignation of the environment minister.\n\n\"This dialogue is a failure. If they agree, we starve and if they disagree we get killed,\" he said. His flip-flops were plastered with photographs of Lebanese politicians.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, 61-year-old Albert Aswad who owns a printing house, brought more than two dozen eggs and a bag of tomatoes and hurled them at the politicians' convoys as they passed by on the way to their meeting. \"Politicians in this country have no morals,\" he said.\n\nJust before the morning meeting, Prime Minister Tammam Salam urged the politicians to make every effort to help end the paralysis. He then called for a Cabinet meeting.\n\n\"I hope at the Cabinet meeting today ... there will be an immediate solution to rid the country of garbage as a way to propagate trust in the country,\" Salam told journalists.\n\nAfter nearly six hours of Cabinet meeting, and shortly before midnight, minister of Agriculture Akram Chehayeb said a plan has been approved to remove trash from the streets, open new landfills and allow municipalities to manage the portfolio previously handled by the government.\n\nDetails of implementation are still unclear, but the plan meets some of the protesters demands, such as passing the trash handling to the municipalities level.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Sarah El Deeb contributed to this report from Beirut.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Lebanese protests resume as leaders debate trash crisis - AP News: BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Thousands of Lebanese demonstrators braved a sandstorm .05/26/2016 19:38:20PM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Thousands of Lebanese demonstrators braved a sandstorm and oppressive humidity to take", "title": "AP News - Lebanese protests resume as leaders debate trash crisis", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2015/09/09/protests-planned-in-lebanon-as-government-dialogue-kicks-off-n2049784", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\252\\1340c261-4d70-4786-af3a-004f1e491768.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 Thousands of Lebanese demonstrators braved a sandstorm and oppressive humidity to take", "title": "AP News - Lebanese protests resume as leaders debate trash crisis", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2015/09/09/protests-planned-in-lebanon-as-government-dialogue-kicks-off-n2049784", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/252/1340c261-4d70-4786-af3a-004f1e491768.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Lebanese protests resume as leaders debate trash crisis, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "His flip-flops were plastered with photographs of Lebanese politicians.\nThe trash crisis has ignited the largest Lebanese protests in years and has emerged as a festering symbol of the government's paralysis and failure to provide basic services.\nJust before midnight, the government said it had approved a plan that promises to end the trash crisis.\n\"They are feeling the sand shifting under them,\" Elias Nassour, a 28-year-old protester, said of the government leaders.\nAt Beirut's main Martyrs' Square, thousands waved red-and-white Lebanese flags and chanted anti-government slogans as night fell."}
