The 2014 midterm elections will be her next stop.\n\nOprah will be hosting a fundraiser for a Democratic congressional candidate in Virginia next month. The fundraiser will held in Arlington, VA for Lavern Chatman who is running to replace retiring Rep. Jim Moran, a Democrat. This area of Virginia is known for being one of the more liberal areas of the state.\n\nAccording to Chatman, \u201cOprah is a good friend and we both share a passion for empowering women and girls for leadership\u2026I am delighted she is coming to town to help with my congressional campaign.\u201d\n\nOprah stayed out of politics in order not to mix her brand with her political opinions, but when Barack Obama ran in 2008, she just couldn\u2019t help but get involved. Many believe her endorsement of Obama was a seminal event in the campaign and helped him to an eventual victory.\n\nFollowing the 2008 Obama victory, Oprah also helped fundraise for Cory Booker in 2013 and has weighed in on Obamacare and gun control issues.\n\nThe event in April with Oprah and Chatman will most likely give a big boost for his campaign. Having already raised over $20,000 since the beginning of the year, it looks like Chatman\u2019s pal could really push him forward as the front runner for this election.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Now that Ms. Winfrey can no longer campaign for Barack Obama, she has decided to dedicate her political interest to helping democrats get elected all over the country.
