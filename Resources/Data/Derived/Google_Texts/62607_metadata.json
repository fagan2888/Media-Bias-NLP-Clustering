Lauren, the 75-year-old who founded the company nearly a half century ago, will remain at the company as executive chairman and chief creative officer. Larsson will report to him.\n\nRelated: Even Fashion Sees the Power of Aging Boomers\n\n\u201cMy job is to think always about the future of our company and how to move it forward,\u201d Lauren said in a statement. \u201cStefan Larsson is exceptionally talented, and he will bring our company a fresh and exciting global perspective. Stefan and I have a strong personal bond and share a vision for the future of Ralph Lauren.\u201d\n\nA former H&M executive, Larsson is widely credited with reviving sales at Old Navy after he was appointed president in 2012. Ralph Lauren is hoping Larsson will carry over his previous success at the budget-conscious retailer in his new post with the more upscale apparel company.\n\nOne of the main troubles facing Ralph Lauren is the strong dollar, which has made its products more costly to consumers abroad and tourists visiting the U.S., while weakening demand among domestic consumers.\n\nRelated: Luxury Fashion Retailer Neiman Marcus Files for IPO\n\nTo a degree, the brand is also struggling to hold onto its fashion credibility. When the Great Recession hit, Ralph Lauren was one of the many retailers that lowered its prices in an effort to maintain sales. Profit margins slipped, and now that the brand\u2019s products are available in so many discount stores, it\u2019s been losing its cachet among high-end fashion consumers.\n\nThe company has also fallen behind the times by not introducing any products that cater to the booming athleisure market. Tory Burch, one of Ralph Lauren\u2019s biggest competitors in the luxury market, became one of the first big-name brands to enter that market by revealing a new athleisure-wear collection last month.\n\nRelated: Why Denim Is a Fading Fashion Trend\n\nThe hiring of Larsson is just the latest move by the company to try to respond to a shifting retail landscape. In August, Ralph Lauren reported quarterly revenue was down 5.3 percent to $1.62 billion. The shares, which traded as high as $186.73 in December, have tumbled since then. The stock closed at $104.12 on Tuesday, but the news about the shakeup in management boosted its price almost 5 percent in after-hours trading.\n\nEarlier this month, Barron\u2019s cited the stock\u2019s slide as a buying opportunity and argued that the currency effects were a temporary problem and that sales should grow as the company looks to increase its presence in the women\u2019s apparel market, build its brand in Europe and Asia and cashes in on an investment in new trend-tracking software.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Luxury lifestyle brand Ralph Lauren Corp.", "title": "Why Ralph Lauren Stepped Down as CEO of His Fashion Empire", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/29/Why-Ralph-Lauren-Stepped-Down-CEO-His-Fashion-Empire", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/ralph_lauren.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/29/Why-Ralph-Lauren-Stepped-Down-CEO-His-Fashion-Empire", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/ralph_lauren.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Luxury lifestyle brand Ralph Lauren Corp.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe21ec\"", "article_summary": "In a news release, Ralph Lauren named Stefan Larsson, president of Gap\u2019s Old Navy, as the company\u2019s new chief executive.\nRelated: Luxury Fashion Retailer Neiman Marcus Files for IPOTo a degree, the brand is also struggling to hold onto its fashion credibility.\nIn August, Ralph Lauren reported quarterly revenue was down 5.3 percent to $1.62 billion.\nWhen the Great Recession hit, Ralph Lauren was one of the many retailers that lowered its prices in an effort to maintain sales.\nRalph Lauren is hoping Larsson will carry over his previous success at the budget-conscious retailer in his new post with the more upscale apparel company."}
