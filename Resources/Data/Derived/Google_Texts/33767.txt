HOUSTON â€” Knile Davis had a 106-yard kickoff return and the Kansas City defense forced five turnovers to cruise to their first playoff win since 1994, a 30-0 wild-card victory over the Houston Texans on Saturday.

On the opening kickoff, Davis got three good blocks around the 10-yard line and then simply outran the rest of the defenders for the second-longest kickoff return TD in postseason history.

The defense took over after that, harassing Brian Hoyer into a fumble and three of his career-high four interceptions before halftime to help the Chiefs (12-5) take a 13-0 lead at halftime.

Alex Smith threw a touchdown pass and Spencer Ware added a 5-yard run on the first play of the fourth quarter to make it 27-0.

The victory broke a streak of eight straight playoff losses by the Chiefs and was their first postseason win since beating the Oilers in Houston on Jan. 16, 1994. They have won 11 straight games.

Hoyer, booed all afternoon, was 15 of 34 for 136 yards as Houston (9-8) lost a home playoff game for the first time.
