Speaking to governors at the White House, President Obama pointedly praised Republican governors that caved to his Obamacare plan of expanding Medicaid.

“I want to thank all the governors, Democrats and Republicans, supporters and some opponents of the ACA who have expanded Medicaid to millions of people over the past two years,” he said. “I think that there’s recognition that it makes sense, and it’s bigger than politics.”

Although some Republican governors continue to resist Medicaid expansion in conservative states, more moderate Republican governors such as Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, Michigan’s Rick Snyder, New Jersey’s Chris Christie, New Mexico’s Susana Martinez, Indiana’s Mike Pence, and Ohio’s Gov. John Kasich have dropped their opposition to the idea.

Obama specifically quoted Ohio Governor John Kasich, who sold the idea in his state arguing that the Medicaid expansion “saves lives, no question about it.”

Obama pressured Republican governors who are still resisting the expansion to consider it.

“If you’re state isn’t one of the 28 that’s already expanded Medicaid, I’d urge you to consider it, because our team is is prepared to work with you to make it happen.” he said.
