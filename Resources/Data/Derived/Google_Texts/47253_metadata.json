Shin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, told a handful of reporters that he had been given the information by the South Korean National Intelligence Service.\n\n\u201cKim,\u201d as Dennis Rodman affectionately calls him, is a cold and ruthless killer \u2013 although perhaps not as ruthless as we once imagined. Sure, he killed his own uncle and chief deputy two years ago, but it appears, my friends, that he at least had the decency to not feed him to a pack of rapid and starving animals. Instead, he supposedly lined him up against a wall somewhere \u2013 and had his acolytes gun him down in cold blood.\n\nHow merciful.\n\nAfter all, as Billy Madison might say, North Korean's dictator is a bad, bad man.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Psycho..05/26/2016 5:49:04AM EST.", "author": "Daniel Doherty", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Psycho.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Fifteen: The Number of \"Senior Officials\" Kim Jong Un Reportedly Executed This Year", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2015/04/29/15-the-number-of-officials-kim-jong-un-executed-this-year-n1992272", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/76/2015-03-17T121645Z_1_LYNXMPEB2G0LO_RTROPTP_3_NORTHKOREA-KIM.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Psycho.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Fifteen: The Number of \"Senior Officials\" Kim Jong Un Reportedly Executed This Year", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2015/04/29/15-the-number-of-officials-kim-jong-un-executed-this-year-n1992272", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/76/2015-03-17T121645Z_1_LYNXMPEB2G0LO_RTROPTP_3_NORTHKOREA-KIM.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Fifteen: The Number of \"Senior Officials\" Kim Jong Un Reportedly Executed This Year, Daniel Doherty, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba8f\"", "article_summary": "After all, as Billy Madison might say, North Korean's dictator is a bad, bad man.\n\u201cKim,\u201d as Dennis Rodman affectionately calls him, is a cold and ruthless killer \u2013 although perhaps not as ruthless as we once imagined.\nShin Kyung-min, a lawmaker with the New Politics Alliance for Democracy, told a handful of reporters that he had been given the information by the South Korean National Intelligence Service.\nIn other words, dictators like Kim Jong Un do not believe in laying people off, or terminating them non-violently:North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is continuing to rule with an iron fist, having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year, according to an assessment by South Korean intelligence agents, a lawmaker who attended a closed briefing said.\nInstead, he supposedly lined him up against a wall somewhere \u2013 and had his acolytes gun him down in cold blood."}
