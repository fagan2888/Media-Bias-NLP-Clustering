And while the cost of health care here is high, people were making do and it seemed to be working,\u201d he said.\n\nBaker said he was disappointed by the waiver\u2019s rejection after lawmakers from both major parties passed a law requiring Gov. Deval Patrick to seek one. In particular, Baker said, Massachusetts under Obamacare risks losing ground on small group and individual health insurance.\n\n\u201cI think we should go back to the feds every week if we have to until they give us a waiver,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now is people are losing coverage that they like, something they were told wouldn\u2019t be happening to them. Many people will have a hard time getting coverage again because of the increase in price that comes with the rollout of the federal health care law and all the new rules associated with that and you have literally tens of thousands of people in Massachusetts right now with a piece of paper that says they have temporary coverage until the state figures out how to fix all the glitches and get it back together.\n\n\"I mean, I think this thing here in Massachusetts has been a real detriment to the progress and the success that we\u2019ve made in health care reform. We\u2019re going to end up with fewer people covered, higher cost of care and a much tougher time for individuals and small business trying to buy insurance,\u201d Baker said.\n\nIn a report last month, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Foundation of Massachusetts listed as added benefits from the ACA: expanded coverage for low- and middle-income populations, fewer coverage restrictions and barriers, simpler eligibility and enrollment processes, additional consumer protections, updated insurance market rules, new payment and delivery system initiatives, and significant additional federal funding.\n\nRELATED:\n\n\u00bb Enrollment in Massachusetts health connector plans falls short due to website glitches", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "State House News Service", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "2014-elections, 2014-massachusetts-governors-race, affordable-care-act, charles-baker, charlie-baker, obamacare, news", "title": "Charlie Baker: Massachusetts should seek Obamacare waiver 'every week if we have to'", "og": {"site_name": "masslive.com", "description": "Massachusetts Republican gubernatorial candidate Charlie Baker said the state should continue to seek certain Affordable Care Act waivers, which have been rejected by the Obama administration.", "title": "Charlie Baker: Massachusetts should seek Obamacare waiver 'every week if we have to'", "url": "http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/01/charlie_baker_massachusetts_sh.html", "image": "http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/14052403-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://image.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/14052403-standard.jpg", "title": "Charlie Baker: Massachusetts should seek Obamacare waiver 'every week if we have to'", "site": "@masslivenews", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Massachusetts Republican gubernatorial candidate Charlie Baker said the state should continue to seek certain Affordable Care Act waivers, which have been rejected by the Obama administration."}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, January 07, 2014, 10:10 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "masslive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, January 07, 2014,  8:33 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Massachusetts Republican gubernatorial candidate Charlie Baker said the state should continue to seek certain Affordable Care Act waivers, which have been rejected by the Obama administration."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf3d3\"", "article_summary": "And while the cost of health care here is high, people were making do and it seemed to be working,\u201d he said.\nIn particular, Baker said, Massachusetts under Obamacare risks losing ground on small group and individual health insurance.\nBefore Obamacare, Baker told Boston Herald Radio, Massachusetts was \u201cseven years ahead of the federal government\u201d on health care reform, with 97 percent of residents covered and a website that he said worked.\nRELATED:\u00bb Enrollment in Massachusetts health connector plans falls short due to website glitches\n\"I mean, I think this thing here in Massachusetts has been a real detriment to the progress and the success that we\u2019ve made in health care reform."}
