But experts say that\u2019s not necessarily the best buy, since those plans often leave members with steep out-of-pocket costs when they get care.\n\nIn some cases, advocates and officials say, people who picked the cheapest options \u2013 known as bronze plans \u2013 ended up not using their coverage because they couldn\u2019t afford to pay for care.\n\n\u201cNationally, we are seeing consumers purchasing bronze plans that should not be purchasing bronze plans,\u201d said Jim Wadleigh, CEO of Access Health CT, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange.\n\nSo what would make customers take more than the monthly premiums into account when picking plans?\n\nAccess Health is developing a tool intended to give customers a fuller picture of their actual costs \u2013 both premiums and the costs they would face when getting care, which can vary widely \u2013 when shopping for coverage.\n\nThe tool is still under development, but is expected to be ready \u2013 albeit with room for improvement in future years \u2013 for the next insurance open enrollment period, which begins Nov. 1.\n\nAs designed, shoppers would enter information \u2013 anonymously \u2013 about their medical conditions and surgeries they anticipate having. The system would project their likely medical costs under each plan, as well as their premium costs, factoring in any tax credits they qualify for to discount the premiums. For someone with significant medical issues, it might show that plans with higher premiums would nonetheless lead to lower overall costs than a bronze plan.\n\nAccess Health officials demonstrated an early version of the tool to members of the exchange\u2019s consumer experience and outreach advisory committee Thursday. Members praised the concept, but suggested a wide range of changes to make it more user-friendly.\n\nAmong the issues: how to rid the tool of acronyms and insurance jargon; how to ensure that customers understand the limitations of the tool and how to use it without putting that information in large blocks of text they will gloss over; how to make clear that customers might face higher costs if they see providers not in their plan\u2019s network; and how much nudging the tool should do to let customers know their cheapest option, within legal requirements that it not steer customers to a particular decision.\n\nArielle Levin Becker / CTMirror.org\n\nAs part of the federal health law, insurance plans are classified by metal tier \u2013 bronze, silver, gold and platinum. In general, plans with the lower tiers tend to have lower premiums but require members to pay more when they get care.\n\nThis year, for example, a 40-year-old in Hartford could buy a bronze plan for $222 per month \u2013 but would have to pay $6,200 toward his medical expenses before the plan begins chipping in. By contrast, a gold plan would cost $346 per month, but the customer would pay less when getting care \u2013 fixed co-payments for most medical services, with a $500 deductible that only applies to certain types of care.\n\nFor people with lower incomes, that distinction can be particularly stark because many are eligible for midlevel silver plans with additionally discounted cost-sharing. The silver premiums are higher than bronze plans, but would require the customers to pay significantly less money when getting care. Advocates say many people who qualify for those silver plans have nonetheless purchased bronze plans because of the lower premiums, and ended up avoiding medical care because of the out-of-pocket costs.\n\nSilver plans were the most popular among Connecticut exchange customers in 2014 and 2015, but the proportion of customers picking bronze plans rose in 2015, while the share of silver and gold plans dropped.\n\nThe tool is intended to help people avoid purchases based solely on premiums. But Wadleigh offered some caveats: It\u2019s most suited for people who have some familiarity with health care, and might be more difficult for people who are healthy and unfamiliar with health insurance.\n\n\u201cThis tool is not going to teach our consumers all the inner workings of health care,\u201d he said, adding that the exchange is also working on broader education for consumers.\n\nThe tool doesn\u2019t include all medical conditions; shoppers would be able to choose from about 20 of the most common conditions, as well as about 10 surgeries, and would be able to identify how severe a condition is. The projected medical costs would vary based on a person\u2019s age and gender.\n\nGerard O\u2019Sullivan, director of the Connecticut Insurance Department\u2019s consumer affairs unit, said the tool should be viewed incrementally. The first version, he said, will be better than the information available to shoppers last year. It will be especially useful, he added, for customers buying plans with help from assisters or insurance agents or brokers.\n\nBecause the costs customers would see include both premiums and out-of-pocket costs for care, the numbers would be higher than what people see on the typical shopping screen, which emphasizes the premium. Committee members noted that could bring some sticker shock.\n\nBut O\u2019Sullivan said it\u2019s important for people to know the real costs.\n\n\u201cFrom the education standpoint of insurance, I think those numbers are good for people to know, because that is what the costs are,\u201d he said. \u201cSo while the numbers are shocking, it\u2019s telling a story.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/08/07/in-insurance-premium-isnt-the-full-price-can-a-tool-help-shoppers/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, insurance", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/08/07/in-insurance-premium-isnt-the-full-price-can-a-tool-help-shoppers/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "Many people shopping for health plans look for the lowest monthly cost.
