Larry Hogan signed the Nurse Practitioner Full Practice Authority Act in May, and as a result, a local nurse practitioner started her own practice.\n\n\u201cWe have advanced degrees. We can diagnose, we can treat, we can prescribe medications,\" said Christa Martin, CRNP, owner of South Side Pediatrics.\n\nThanks to a new bill that went into effect Oct. 1, Maryland nurse practitioners now have full practice authority. Beforehand, practitioners had to have a collaborating physician.\n\n\u201cThey had to work with us, supervise us, and attest that we were capable of taking care of patients. And now, we're completely independent. There's no requirement for collaboration,\" Martin said.\n\nMartin was inspired to open her own practice after the ruling.\n\n\u201cIt allowed me to be just completely independent - go out on my own, be my own boss, make my own hours, and set a cap on how many patients I see. Unfortunately because there's such a need for providers, they have to double and triple book,\u201d Martin said.\n\nOverbooking means less time with the patients -- Martin said there is a shortage of doctors - and this could help patients get the care they need.\n\n\"The Affordable Care Act, what everyone calls ObamaCare, there's more patients who need to get into care for physicals for vaccines. And there was such a backlog because there are not enough providers. There are not enough doctors, and now we've helped fill in that gap,\" Martin concluded.\n\nMaryland is the twenty-first state to implement full practice authority for nurse practitioners.\n\nMartin said the type of care provided wouldn't vary at all between physician and nurse practitioner; the main difference would be educational level. In terms of patient care, there is no difference\n\nThe grand opening for her practice, South Side Pediatrics, is Nov. 2.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maryland Gov.
