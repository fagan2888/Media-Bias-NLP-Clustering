The plan covers people who can't afford healthcare but don't qualify for Medicaid.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act now covers many of the people who used to use the Health Plan, says County Commissioner Todd Tennis.\n\n\"The Affordable Care Act was able to come in and take up a lot of the slack that we had been using the millage for,\" Tennis said. Ingham County decided to roll back the amount of funding going to the plan to reflect the number of people it served. The millage that funds the plan will be reduced by one third - from .52 mils to .35 mils - for the 2016 tax year.\n\n\"This change is essentially a reflection of the fact that we've gone from over 11,000 people on the plan down to about 10 percent of that,\" Tennis said.\n\nThe cut will not affect the services the health plan provides, Tennis says. In fact, some of the extra money is going to adding basic dental health coverage and helping mental health services replace some of the funding lost when the state cut its funding.\n\n\"We're actually going to be able to help out our mental health agencies because that's a critical issue,\" Tennis said. \"Whether it's a traditional mental health issues or substance abuse issues. That's something that we're seeing a real problem with in the county.\"\n\nThe change goes into effect starting in 2016.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Property taxes in Ingham County are dropping next year.
