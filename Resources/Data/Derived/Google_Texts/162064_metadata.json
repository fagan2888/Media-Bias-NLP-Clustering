Clinton garners 48 percent, while 3 percent say they are unsure.\n\nRelated: How Clinton\u2019s Speech Capitalized on Disenchantment with Trump-Style GOP Foreign Policy\n\nThe Bloomberg poll offers further evidence that the former secretary of state continues to struggle on issues of trustworthiness and her relationship to Wall Street, a topic Sanders has used to drive home his message of economic inequality. Just a quarter of likely Democratic voters said Clinton is the most honest candidate, while 64 percent picked Sanders.\n\nMore than 60 percent of voters also said Sanders would do more to curb Wall Street.\n\nThere are some nuggets of good news in the polls for Clinton as Democrats gets ready to vote in Alaska, Hawaii and Washington this weekend. She leads Sanders 50 percent to 47 percent among those who have yet to vote in a primary or caucus, a sign that her march the party\u2019s nomination is still on track. And she enjoys a three-to-one advantage over Sanders on the issue of terrorism.\n\nRelated: With Arizona Win, Clinton Needs a Little More Than 600 Delegates to Clinch It\n\nClinton has 1,690 of the 2,383 delegates needed to become the party\u2019s nominee, while Sanders has 946, according to an Associated Press tracker.\n\nHowever, there could be a rough patch ahead for Clinton in the general election, if Republicans somehow end up selecting Ohio Gov. John Kasich as their candidate.\n\nIn hypothetical match-ups, Sanders beats Republican frontrunner Donald Trump by 24 points, holds a 12-point lead over Ted Cruz and a 4-point edge over Kasich among likely voters. Clinton bests Trump and Cruz by 18 and 9 points, respectively -- but trails Kasich by 4 points.\n\nRelated: Sanders\u2019 Attacks on Clinton\u2019s Foreign Policy Could Help Trump\n\nThe former New York senator fares slightly better in a new Fox News poll. She receives 55 percent support for the nomination among Democratic primary voters, to Sanders 42 percent. That\u2019s a reversal from over a month ago, when the former first lady trailed by 3 points.\n\nSanders can continue to hound Clinton with wins in this weekend\u2019s caucuses. Very little polling has been conducted in the three states, and Sanders\u2019 camp is confident it can sweep all three and collect the 142 delegates at stake.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Those thinking that the Democratic presidential primary has essentially gone on autopilot just as the nomination process hits the midway point should consider a couple of new polls that shows Hillary Clinton can\u2019t afford to take her eye off Bernie Sanders", "title": "Why Clinton Can\u2019t Afford to Take Her Eyes Off Bernie Sanders", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/24/Why-Clinton-Can-t-Afford-Take-Her-Eyes-Bernie-Sanders", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/hillary_clinton_bernie_sanders_split.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/24/Why-Clinton-Can-t-Afford-Take-Her-Eyes-Bernie-Sanders", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/hillary_clinton_bernie_sanders_split.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Those thinking that the Democratic presidential primary has essentially gone on autopilot just as the nomination process hits the midway point should consider a couple of new polls that shows Hillary Clinton can\u2019t afford to take her eye off Bernie Sanders", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Just a quarter of likely Democratic voters said Clinton is the most honest candidate, while 64 percent picked Sanders.\nShe receives 55 percent support for the nomination among Democratic primary voters, to Sanders 42 percent.\nJust when it looks like the Democratic presidential primary has gone on autopilot, several new polls suggest that Hillary Clinton had better keep an eye on Bernie Sanders.\nSanders can continue to hound Clinton with wins in this weekend\u2019s caucuses.\nClinton bests Trump and Cruz by 18 and 9 points, respectively -- but trails Kasich by 4 points."}
