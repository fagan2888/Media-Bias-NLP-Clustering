What it wasn\u2019t, especially as regards economic policy, was informative.\n\nWhy such a big hole in an otherwise far-ranging debate?\n\nIt\u2019s not because Republican voters don\u2019t care about our current economic challenges. A recent poll found that 53 percent of Republicans agree that \u201cjust a few people at the top have a chance to get ahead\u201d (61 percent of people overall felt that way). Majorities of Republicans worry about the cost of college, health care, retirement savings, and whether their kids will do as well as they\u2019ve done.\n\n[Sign up for The Daily 202, The Washington Post\u2019s new political tipsheet]\n\nNor is it because the candidates themselves are insensitive to these issues. Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio have prominently expressed their concerns about inequality and its impact on the opportunities of the less advantaged.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that the economic discussion was \u201cTrumped\u201d by the presence of the\u2026um\u2026outspoken front-runner. On the other hand, one might have expected that \u201cThe Donald\u2019s\u201d announcement that he\u2019s both a serial defaulter (\u201con four occasions\u201d he took advantaged of bankruptcy law) and a multi-billionaire might have generated some attacks from his competitors on economic fairness grounds.\n\nJared Bernstein, a former adviser to Vice President Biden, says the economy wasn\u2019t invited to the GOP debate\n\nOr it could be the fact that following the Great Recession, the economy has consistently improved under President Obama\u2019s watch. As the administration never tires of pointing out (not that I blame them), the president has presided over 65 straight months wherein private employers have added a total of 13 million jobs. That\u2019s tricky territory for those who want to argue that the toxic combination of Obama and Obamacare has been terrible for growth and jobs.\n\nStill, for many in the middle-class, that growth has been something they read about in the paper rather than something they see reflected in their living standards, a point the White House often concedes, and thus seemingly fair game for a Republican debate.\n\nThere were, of course, some passing references to economic policies. Governors present and former bragged about how they balanced their budgets (a bit of an odd claim, since states are prohibited from running deficits). Numerous candidates weighed in on tax reform; Gov. Bush was asked to defend his 4 percent growth target for the economy (to double the current growth rate, he\u2019d get rid of \u201cjob-killer\u201d regulations, build the XL pipeline, and whack Obamacare).\n\nBut I can\u2019t imagine any of these points scratch the itch of a voter facing economic challenges. A defining aspect of U.S.-style income inequality has been that too little growth has reached the middle class. So even if we could grow faster, which policies would the candidates propose to reconnect that growth to middle-class prosperity?\n\nIn fact, at least since Reagan, Republican candidates have been unable to answer that question, as the core principle of their economic policy has been to further enrich the wealthy under the assumption that they\u2019ll create growth that will trickle down to everyone else. And as that model has been so thoroughly discredited\u2014to the point where prominent conservative thinkers are issuing stern warnings that if they want to win, they must pursue policies to help those on the wrong side of the inequality divide\u2014they\u2019ve yet to come up with a replacement.\n\nIn other words, the economy didn\u2019t show up at the debate because it wasn\u2019t invited. And it wasn\u2019t invited because it had no place to sit. With one exception, these candidates appeared to lack credible policy ideas to reconnect growth and prosperity.\n\nThe exception was Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2019s defense of his implementation of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion in his state. In a striking break from almost everything else said, and a particularly dramatic break from bashing anything to do with the government (excepting bankruptcy law), Gov. Kasich talked resonantly about helping the working poor, the mentally ill, and rehabilitation for prisoners suffering from drug addiction. He even noted an important fiscal point regarding Medicaid\u2019s effective cost controls.\n\nAs I noted, this hole in the platform is a known shortcoming. Though he didn\u2019t mention it at the debate, Marco Rubio has proposed to fill it with an idea to cut taxes for the wealthy by zeroing out capital gains and dividends taxation, while providing a robust tax credit for low and middle-income parents (though the plan actually hurts the very poor).\n\nAnd yet, as Dylan Matthews reports, \u201csupply-side\u2026conservatives and libertarians have criticized the child tax credit proposal, principally for distracting from the\u2026much more important project of cutting marginal tax rates.\u201d\n\nAgain, none of this is new. George W. Bush ran on \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d only to cut taxes disproportionately for the wealthy. Rep. Paul Ryan talks with conviction about lifting up the poor while writing budgets that decimate their supports.\n\nDress it up any way you like, the heart of conservative economic policy is still \u201ctrickle-down,\u201d exactly the wrong prescription in the age of inequality. Apparently, there\u2019s no debating that point.\n\nJared Bernstein, a former chief economist to Vice President Biden, is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and author of the new book \u201cThe Reconnection Agenda: Reuniting Growth and Prosperity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The exception was Ohio Gov.
