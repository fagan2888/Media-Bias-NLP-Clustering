With the United States\u2019 corporate-managed media and politics culture fixated on Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, the Republican National Committee, Ted Cruz, and even sometimes the nominal socialist Bernie Sanders, Obama\u2019s ongoing criminal record on behalf of corporate rule and American Empire has gone under the radar like no time in recent memory.\n\nBeneath the hoopla over who will sit in the Oval Office in 2017, it becomes all too easy to forget that the current occupant persists in serial killing Muslims with a far-flung Drone War that Noam Chomsky has aptly described as \u201cthe most extreme terrorist campaign of modern times.\u201d Also nudged to the margins of public attention is Obama\u2019s continuing quest to secure final passage of the Trans Pacific Partnership, a blatantly arch-corporatist, eco-cidal, regressive, and authoritarian measure that is disliked by the majority of the U.S. populace (all four of the top presidential candidates, including even its onetime leading champion Hilary Clinton, are technically opposed to the TPP because of popular dissatisfaction with such \u201cfree trade\u2019 [investor rights] measures.)\n\nIt\u2019s consistent with the neoliberal Obama\u2019s long record of lending fake-progressive assistance to the rich and powerful. His championing of the TPP fits the profile of his long ruling class rap sheet. It matches his mega bailout and his ongoing political and fiscal protection of the leading, arch-parasitic financial institutions that crashed the economy and crafted a business-rule-as-usual \u201crecovery\u201d for profits over people. It corresponds with his so-called Affordable Care Act, a blatant negation of longstanding majority U.S. support for national single-payer health insurance. As with his recent arrogant lecture to the Cuban people in Havana, the nation\u2019s \u201cfirst Black president\u201d seems determined to serve the nation\u2019s unelected and interrelated dictatorships of money and empire until last days in office.\n\nAll of this is quite consistent with the real and \u201cdeeply conservative\u201d Obama that serious investigators of the Obama phenomenon understood before his election to the presidency. That description of Obama belongs to the liberal journalist and New Yorker writer Larissa MacFarquhar in the spring of 2007. \u201cIn his view of history, in his respect for tradition, in his skepticism that the world can be changed any way but very, very slowly,\u201d MacFarquhar wrote after extensive interviews with candidate Obama in May of 2007, \u201cObama is deeply conservative. There are moments when he sounds almost Burkean\u2026It\u2019s not just that he thinks revolutions are unlikely: he values continuity and stability for their own sake, sometimes even more than he values change for the good.\u201d MacFarquhar cited as an example of this reactionary sentiment Obama\u2019s reluctance to embrace single-payer health insurance on the Canadian model, which he told her would \u201cso disruptive that people feel like suddenly what they\u2019ve known for most of their lives is thrown by the wayside.\u201d Obama told MacFarquhar that \u201cwe\u2019ve got all these legacy systems in place, and managing the transition, as well as adjusting the culture to a different system, would be difficult to pull off. So we may need a system that\u2019s not so disruptive that people feel like suddenly what they\u2019ve known for most of their lives is thrown by the wayside.\u201d So what if large popular majorities in the U.S. had long favored the single-payer model? So what if single payer would let people keep the doctors of their choice, only throwing away the protection pay off to the private insurance mafia? So what if \u201cthe legacy systems\u201d Obama defended included corporate insurance and pharmaceutical oligopolies that regularly threw millions of American lives by the wayside of market calculation, causing enormous disruptive harm and death for the populace?\n\nBetraying Black Voters\n\nFew Americans beneath the 1% have benefitted much from Obama\u2019s seven years in office. The absence of tangible gains for non-affluent Americans is especially glaring in Black America, which turned out for Obama in record numbers in 2008 and 2012. Black median family income under Obama has fallen by one fifth. Black home ownership has declined and the Black-white wealth gap has risen. In 2009, white households were seven times richer than black households. Now, white households are eight times wealthier. Deep and deadly racial bias remains endemic across the nation\u2019s giant, globally unmatched criminal (in)justice system of mass surveillance, arrest, imprisonment, and felony branding.\n\nAdding insult to injury, white Americans habitually point to Obama\u2019s presidency as final proof (for them) that anti-Black racism no longer poses serious barriers to Black advancement and equality. Countless Caucasians have told me \u201cHey, the President of the United States is Black, okay? Stop talking about race!\u201d Never mind that racism, seriously understood, is about how the nation\u2019s core day-to-day institutions (the labor market, the housing market, the education system, the criminal justice system, etc.) and social structures function, not simply a matter of counting racial faces in high places. Never mind that the \u201cBlack but not like Jesse\u201d Obama\u2019s ascendancy depended on pleasing the white majority by not offending its delicate racial sensibilities and on running with a deceptive \u201cpost-racial\u201d narrative that provided cover for the persistence of societal and structural racism. Never mind that Obama has barely lifted a finger as president to confront the nation\u2019s profoundly entrenched institutional racism. Or that the United States\u2019 first half-white president has continued his nasty Black-bourgeois and white-pleasing habit of giving lower and working class Black Americans noxious neoliberal lectures on their own supposed personal and cultural responsibility for their disproportionate presence at the bottom of the nation\u2019s savagely steep socioeconomic pyramids.\n\n\u201cTired of Seeing Obama Disrespected\u201d\n\nFor these and other reasons, \u201cI\u2019m [also] Ready,\u201d to quote a recent essay by the Black philosophy professor and university diversity coordinator Lawrence Ware, \u201cFor President Obama to Leave the White House.\u201d My reasons are somewhat different than Ware\u2019s, however. Ware is understandably disgusted at the white racism that Obama, \u201cthe most disrespected president in American history,\u201d has confronted. The affronts have been egregious, from the wacky white Birthers who questioned Obama\u2019s national origins to the southern white Congressman (Joe Wilson) who shouted \u201cYou Lie\u201d during a State of the Union Address, to the white Daily Caller reporter who heckled the president in the Rose Garden, and the former white New York City Mayor (the ridiculous Rudy Guliani) who complained that Obama \u201cwasn\u2019t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country.\u201d Now we have the spectacle of a white Republican Senate Judiciary Committee that refuses to hold confirmation hearings or even to meet with the moderate Republican white male that Obama nominated to replace the recently deceased right-wing Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\n\u201cIt is clear that no matter how high you rise, no matter what office you hold, no matter how hard you work,\u201d Ware writes, \u201cif you are black, many will view and treat you like a second-class citizen\u2026I\u2019m tired of seeing President Obama blatantly disrespected, and my soul is weary from having to see him grin and bear it. I\u2019m ready for President Obama to be free from the burden of having to perform for white supremacy \u2013 and I\u2019m ready to be free from the burden of having to watch him do it.\u201d\n\nA Vacuous-to-Repressive Neoliberal President\n\nNow, of course, the insults and denigration that Obama has received from malevolent white Republican reactionaries and idiots like Joe Wilson (R-SC), Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Charles Grassley (R-IA) and the leading Birther Donald Trump have been repellent. They are racist and vile and deserve repudiation from all decent progressives. At the same time, however, Leftists of all colors have always had some very good reasons to hold Obama in flaming contempt and to look forward to his coming helicopter flight off the grounds of the White House (in nine months and fifteen days). These reasons have nothing to do with racism and everything to do with the fake-progressive poseur Obama\u2019s power-serving conservativism, including his conservativism on race. They go back well before Obama\u2019s presidency and indeed prior to his emergence on the national scene. Listen to the Black left political scientist Adolph Reed, Jr\u2019s description of the future president in The Village Voice just after Obama won his initial election to the Illinois Senate:\n\n\u201cIn Chicago, for instance, we\u2019ve gotten a foretaste of the new breed of foundation-hatched black communitarian voices; one of them, a smooth Harvard lawyer with impeccable do-good credentials and vacuous-to-repressive neoliberal politics, has won a state senate seat on a base mainly in the liberal foundation and development worlds. His fundamentally bootstrap line was softened by a patina of the rhetoric of authentic community, talk about meeting in kitchens, small-scale solutions to social problems, and the predictable elevation of process over program \u2013 the point where identity politics converges with old-fashioned middle-class reform in favoring form over substance. I suspect that his ilk is the wave of the future in U.S. black politics, as in Haiti and wherever else the International Monetary Fund has sway.\u201d\n\nHow was that for a dead-on advance look at what would be the basic nature of Obama\u2019s political career up through his presidency? Ten years later, the investigative journalist Ken Silverstein examined \u201cthe smooth Harvard lawyer\u201d on the eve of Obama\u2019s presidential campaign \u201cIt\u2019s not always clear what Obama\u2019s financial backers want,\u201d Ken Silverstein noted in a Harpers\u2019 Magazine report titled \u201cObama, Inc.,\u201d \u201cbut it seems safe to conclude that his campaign contributors are not interested merely in clean government and political reform\u2026On condition of anonymity,\u201d Silverstein added, \u201cone Washington lobbyist I spoke with was willing to point out the obvious: that big donors would not be helping out Obama if they didn\u2019t see him as a \u2018player.\u2019 The lobbyist added: \u2018What\u2019s the dollar value of a starry-eyed idealist?\u2019\u201d\n\nDisrespect Obama? You\u2019re damn right, from the anti-racist portside. Read the pages of the Black-run and militantly anti-racist radical zine Black Agenda Report (BAR) from its origins in 2006 on. There you will find a large number of essays and commentaries detailing Obama\u2019s allegiance and service to each of what Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. called \u201cthe triple evils that are interrelated\u201d: white supremacy; economic injustice (capitalism); and U.S.-imperial militarism. Countless such reflections and reports can be found across progressive media, all written by non- and anti-racists. My own early books, talks, and essays (many of the last category appeared on BAR) on and against the Obama phenomenon and presidency followed my five-year stint as the director of a leading anti-racist research department in Chicago.\n\nO.J.Bama? Some Curious Parallels\n\nLately, watching the B-minus FOX cable series on the O.J. Simpson trial, I\u2019ve been struck by similarities between Obama and Simpson. Please, super-PC liberal identitarians, do not misunderstand me. I am aware that Simpson is a vicious thug (the National Football League\u2019s brutal, brain-wrecking sport may have something to do with that) who savagely murdered his wife and her friend Ron Goldman, whereas Obama is a refined Harvard Law graduate who published a semi-eloquent coming-of-age memoir, worked as a community organizer, taught Constitutional Law, sat on liberal foundation boards, and entered electoral politics. Obama is by all indications an unusually decent president in his private and personal life, like Jimmy Carter. It is preposterous to imagine him stabbing anyone to death in a fit of jealous rage.\n\nBut the parallels are real. I\u2019ll mention five. First, like the 1980s and 1990s O.J. brand prior to the famous double murder, the Brand Obama that arose in 2004 depended on a Black personality\u2019s cross-racial popularity with whites, informed by a sense that the hero in question wasn\u2019t really all that Black and was therefore unthreatening to the racially skittish and thin-skinned white majority.\n\nSecond, like O.J. after his emergence as a star athlete, Obama has never had all that much allegiance or strong connection to the Black community. Simpson lived in the tony white West Side Los Angeles neighborhood of Brentwood, where he killed his white ex-wife, and hung out mainly with white friends like Robert Kardashian. O.J. was initially taken aback by his race-conscious Black lawyer Johnnie Cochran\u2019s determination to \u201cplay the race card\u201d in the Simpson murder trial. \u201cI\u2019m not Black,\u201d Simpson protested, \u201cI\u2019m O.J.!\u201d\n\nObama for his part came from a relatively privileged white family in Hawaii and climbed up through the predominantly white and elite Ivy League institutions of Columbia University and Harvard Law. Even as a state senator representing a Black majority district on the South Side of Chicago (while living and working as a professor in the upper middle class and integrated neighborhood of Hyde Park-Kenwood [my own childhood neighborhood], he was remarkably unpopular in Black Chicago, where he was seen as \u201ctoo white,\u201d \u201ctoo Ivy League,\u201d too University of Chicago (where he taught as a highly paid adjunct), and too connected to predominantly white downtown corporate interests and pseudo-liberal do-gooder foundations. The U.S. Congressman and former Black Panther Bobby Rush exploited these sentiments to crush Obama when the future president challenged Rush for his supermajority Black South Side congressional district in 2000.\n\nDuring his rise to the U.S. Senate and then the presidency, Obama relied heavily on the support of wealthy white funders including his good Zionist friend Lester Crown, a Forbes 400 capitalist and chairman of the Chicago Commercial Club and the imperial Chicago Council on Global Affairs. He did everything he could to disassociate himself from \u201cexcessive Blackness\u201d and from the cause of racial justice, deeply understood, in his Senate and presidential campaigns. As president, Obama has done nothing, or next to it, to repay Black Americans for the flood of identity-politicized support they gave him after he emerged as a state-(Illinois-) wide and national political force in 2003 and 2004.\n\nThird, as with O.J., Obama\u2019s lack of any special concern for Black America (the actual existence of which Obama denied in the Democratic National Convention speech that made him an overnight celebrity in the summer of 2004[1]) has not stopped Team Obama from garnering benefits from the simple fact of the president\u2019s skin color. O.J. got away with murder thanks to a brilliantly executed racial strategy in the legal and public courtrooms. For his part, Obama\u2019s race helped motivate millions of voters (including droves of liberal white voters) to mark ballots of him with little or any regard for his deeply conservative, power-serving essence and record. It has also made liberals, progressives, and even some leftists unduly unwilling and unable to speak, write, and even think clearly about and against \u201cour Black president\u2019s\u201d bottomless loyalty to concentrated wealth and power. Along the way, Team Obama has not been above deploying a certain amount of manufactured Blackness \u2013 a key part of the Simpson team\u2019s trial strategy \u2013 to provide cover for his underlying fidelity to white-supremacist power structures.\n\nFourth, both O.J. and Obama represent in their own different ways the triumph of private over public power in the neoliberal era. The public prosecutors\u2019 office that tried to send Simpson away for a ferocious double murder was outmatched by the well-heeled private defense team that the millionaire ex-athlete was able to assemble. More than two decades later an Obama administration that was staffed by Wall Street agents would give the nation what the liberal columnist William Greider would memorably call \u201ca blunt lesson about power, who has it and who doesn\u2019t. They have watched,\u201d Greider wrote, \u201cWashington run to rescue the very financial interests who caused the catastrophe. They learned that government has plenty of money to spend \u2013 when the right people want it\u201d And little to spend on the rest of us, the wrong people, soon to be known as \u201cthe 99%,\u201d left to ask \u201cwhere\u2019s my bailout?\u201d\n\n\u201cA Killer\u201d \u2013 and \u201cGood at\u201d it\n\nFifth, Obama, like OJ and like all U.S. presidents before him, is a murderer \u2013 and this of course on a much larger scale than Simpson.\n\n\u201cPeace prize? He\u2019s a killer.\u201d So said a young Pashtun man to an Al Jazeera English reporter on December 10, 2009, the day that Obama was given the Nobel Peace Prize by some very silly white people in Norway. \u201cObama,\u201d the man added, \u201chas only brought war to our country.\u201d The man spoke from the village of Armal, where a crowd of 100 gathered around the bodies of 12 people, one family from a single home. The 12 were killed, witnesses reported, by U.S. Special Forces during a late night raid. \u201cWhy are they giving Obama a peace medal?\u201d another village resident asked. \u201cHe claims to want to bring security to us but he brings only death. Death to him.\u201d\n\nAl Jazeera also went to the Afghan village of Bola Boluk, where a U.S. bombing butchered dozens of civilians the previous spring. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve the award,\u201d a young woman said. \u201cHe bombed us and left us with nothing, not even a home\u201d\n\nObama had blasted her village in May of 2009. In the first week of that month, the president\u2019s air-strikes killed well more than 100 noncombatants in Bola Boluk, located in western Afghanistan\u2019s Farah Province. Ninety-three of the dead villagers torn apart by U.S. explosives were children. Just 22 were males 18 years or older. As the New York Times reported:\n\n\u201cIn a phone call played on a loudspeaker on Wednesday to outraged members of the Afghan Parliament,\u201d The New York Times reported, \u201cthe governor of Farah Province\u2026said that as many as 130 civilians had been killed.\u201d According to one Afghan legislator and eyewitness, \u201cthe villagers bought two tractor trailers full of pieces of human bodies to his office to prove the casualties that had occurred. Everyone at the governor\u2019s cried, watching that shocking scene.\u201d\n\nThe response of Obama\u2019s Pentagon to this horrific incident \u2013 one among many such mass U.S. aerial killings in Afghanistan before and since \u2013 was like something one might expect from the totalitarian, U.S.- and Western Europe-backed Paul Kagame dictatorship in Rwanda. It was to absurdly blame the civilian deaths on \u201cTaliban grenades.\u201d While Obama\u2019s Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed \u201cregret\u201d about the loss of innocent life, neither she nor Obama would issue an apology or acknowledge U.S. responsibility for the blasting apart of civilian bodies in Farah Province. The United States, Obama has said both as a U.S. Senator and as president, should not apologize for its \u201cmistakes\u201d (that is, its crimes). This, he explains, is because the United States is \u201can enormous force for good in the world,\u201d one that prefers to \u201clook forward,\u201d not \u201cbackwards.\u201d\n\nThe child-killing Obama administration struck again, execution-style, at the end of 2009 in Ghazi Khan, a village in eastern Afghanistan. As the Times of London reported on December 31st, 2009:\n\n\u201cAmerican-led troops\u2026yesterday\u2026dragg[ed] innocent children from their beds and shooting them during a night raid that left ten people dead. Afghan government investigators said that eight schoolchildren were killed, all but one of them from the same family. Locals said that some victims were handcuffed before being killed\u2026In a telephone interview last night, the headmaster [of the local school] said that the victims were asleep in three rooms when the troops arrived. \u2018Seven students were in one room,\u2019 said Rahman Jan Ehsas. \u2018A student and one guest were in another room, a guest room, and a farmer was asleep with his wife in a third building. First the foreign troops entered the guest room and shot two of them. Then they entered another room and handcuffed the seven students. Then they killed them. Abdul Khaliq [the farmer] heard shooting and came outside. When they saw him they shot him as well. He was outside. That\u2019s why his wife wasn\u2019t killed.\u2019 A local elder, Jan Mohammed, said that three boys were killed in one room and five were handcuffed before they were shot. \u2018I saw their school books covered in blood,\u2019 he said.\u201d\n\nBut all this was just a small foretaste of further carnage to come courtesy of the new Nobel Peace laureate. Obama\u2019s body count has risen considerably from those early days, thanks primarily to his drone campaign, which has killed many thousands across the Muslim world from Somalia and Yemen to Pakistan and Afghanistan. The president\u2019s victims have included European doctors with Medicins Sans Frontiers (MSF) targeted by a US AC-130 Gunship that killed 30 physicians and patients in the Afghan town of Kunduz last October. Thanks to the large number of white European professionals killed in the horrific \u201cincident\u201d (war crime), one of Obama\u2019s military officials had to break form and issue a formal apology in this case.\n\nObama\u2019s chilling, far-flung, personally supervised, and cowardly targeted assassination program has done more than George W. Bush\u2019s clumsy \u201cboots on the ground\u201d invasion of Iraq to expand the geographic scope and fervor of Islamist jihad.\n\nIt has been a source of some ironic entertainment for Obama. As the highly respected establishment journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann\u2019s reported in their book Double Down: Game Change 2012, the President once joked to his aides that, thanks to the drone weapon, \u201cit turns out I\u2019m really good at killing people.\u201d That\u2019s different from Simpson, who kept insisting that he\u2019d killed nobody (even if he did later write a book titled If I Did It) and who showed himself as less than stealthy and skillful at murder (even if his defense team and a poor prosecution helped him overcome his sloppiness at homicide).\n\nNo journalist followed up the report of Obama\u2019s chilling \u201cgood at killing people\u201d remark with a request for comment from Obama\u2019s former South Side Chicago pastor, Reverend Jeremiah Wright \u2013 the anti-racist and anti-imperialist Black preacher who Obama threw under the bus in the name of color-blind American Exceptionalism in March of 2008. Too bad. A call to Reverend Wright have made an interesting story.\n\nThe Class One Serves: Content of Character and Color of Skin\n\nIn his famous 1963 \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, Dr. King looked forward to the day when Americans \u201cwill not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.\u201d What has Obama\u2019s presidency revealed about his character behind his skin? Very, very little that is remotely worthy of respect and far, far more that is worthy of profound disrespect from an anti-racist Left perspective. His presidency has exposed him as being precisely what Reed, myself, John Pilger, and numerous other and multi-colored Left commentators including Bruce Dixon, Glen Ford and others at Black Agenda Report tried to tell progressives Obama was well before the candidate sent chills up liberal legs by becoming a serious Black presidential contender in the land of slavery. The Obama years have exposed him as a dedicated agent of each of the \u201cthe triple evils\u201d wrapped in \u201cprogressive\u201d branding and cloaked by the resistance-disabling tonic of \u201cmiddle class identity politics\u201d (Reed). That politics sustains the suspicion that the President\u2019s critics (even his Left ones) don\u2019t really object to his policies but are upset rather by the color of his skin. Surely when the democratic socialist King made his famous, ringing remark on character and color, he did not mean for it inhibit legitimate denunciation of a Black politician or policymaker for doing the poisonous bidding of a racist Empire and a vicious capitalist ruling class.\n\n\u201cWhat matters,\u201d anti-colonial psychiatrist Frantz Fanon wrote 63 years ago in his first book, Black Skin, White Masks, \u201cis not so much the color of your skin as the power you serve and the millions you betray.\u201d Fanon was reflecting on the black African leaders who failed to serve the interests of the black masses whose national aspirations they rode to power in the post-World War II era. His formulation holds with haunting relevance to the performance of the in-power African National Congress in post-apartheid neoliberal South Africa and in its own way to the presidency of Barack Obama.\n\nAlso worth recalling are Pilger\u2019s eloquent reflections on Obama in the summer of 2009. \u201cThe clever young man who recently made it to the White House,\u201d Pilger told a gathering of international socialists in San Francisco, \u201cis a very fine hypnotist, partly because it is indeed exciting to see an African American at the pinnacle of power in the land of slavery. However, this is the 21st century and race, together with gender and even class, can be very seductive tools of propaganda. For what is so often overlooked and what matters above all, is the class one serves.\u201d\n\nI, for one, am ready to be free of the burden of being expected to grant undue deference to a president who betrays the ideals of the great social justice and antiwar leader (King) whose bust sits behind Obama as he orders another mass-murderous and arch-terrorist drone hit somewhere in the Middle East, North Africa, or South Asia.\n\nHillary Playing Cards\u2026and Maybe Losing\n\nNow the first Black President is stealthily giving his seal of approval to his unpopular and far less charismatic successor Hillary Clinton over the considerably more well-liked and progressive Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders (who is \u201cdisappointed\u201d by Obama\u2019s Wall Street-pleasing domestic policies but embraces his drone war and other imperial policies). For all the \u201cbad blood\u201d said to exist between Obama and the Clintons, she and her husband are cut from the same exact deeply conservative \u201cNew Democrat\u201d ideological cloth as the current U.S. president (they helped weave and dye the cloth in the 1970s and 1980s, in fact). Mrs. Clinton represents a continuation both of Wall Street-captive imperial neoliberalism and of identity politics combining with partisan politics to provide cover for that noxious policy stew. She plays the race card to keep an advantage with Black voters, subtly accusing Sanders of being racially incorrect by daring to have express some dissatisfaction with Obama\u2019s nauseating conservatism. And of course the Clinton campaign has played the gender card against \u201cangry white male Beniebros,\u201d deleting the fact that Mrs. Clinton is losing among younger female Democratic voters. In four or perhaps eight more years, perhaps we will to read essays from disgruntled women and feminists on how they are ready for Hillary Clinton to leave the White House because they are tired of seeing the nation\u2019s first female president disrespected by sexist men within and beyond Congress. The sexist and offense that these writers complain about will be real and noxious enough to merit progressive condemnation. And meanwhile, perhaps, Leftists will note that the Hillary Clinton presidency has been a disaster \u2013 an imperial and neoliberal nightmare \u2013 for millions upon millions of women (and children and men) at home and abroad. Left activists and writers will look forward to Hillary\u2019s departure for at least not having to be suspected of sexism for daring to observe that her presidency served the nation\u2019s unelected and combined dictatorships of class, empire, race, eco-cide, and patriarchy \u2013 what we might today call the five evils that are interrelated.\n\nOr maybe not. The former Goldwater Girl who decided that right-wing Republicans like Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay were not true conservatives like her and her husband lacks Bill\u2019s unmatched skill at conducting what a still left Christopher Hitchens called in 1999 \u201cthe essence of American politics\u201d: \u201cthe manipulation of populism by elitism.\u201d A terrible campaigner, she is much less effective than Obama and Bill at bamboozling progressives. As I write today on the morning of Tuesday, April 5th, it seems distinctly possible that Sanders\u2019 recent string of primary victories will continue today in Wisconsin. Sanders\u2019 seems increasingly less hopeless in New York and California, his gender and race notwithstanding.

With the United States\u2019 corporate-managed media and politics culture fixated on Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, the Republican National Committee, Ted Cruz, and even sometimes the nominal socialist Bernie Sanders, Obama\u2019s ongoing criminal record on behalf of corporate rule and American Empire has gone under the radar like no time in recent memory.\r\n\r\nBeneath the hoopla over who will sit in the Oval Office in 2017, it becomes all too easy to forget that the current occupant persists in serial killing Muslims with a far-flung Drone War that Noam Chomsky has aptly described as \u201cthe most extreme terrorist campaign of modern times.\u201d Also nudged to the margins of public attention is Obama\u2019s continuing quest to secure final passage of the Trans Pacific Partnership, a blatantly arch-corporatist, eco-cidal, regressive, and authoritarian measure that is disliked by the majority of the U.S. populace (all four of the top presidential candidates, including even its onetime leading champion Hilary Clinton, are technically opposed to the TPP because of popular dissatisfaction with such \u201cfree trade\u2019 [investor rights] measures.)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "robots": "noodp, noydir"}, "article_summary": "There\u2019s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there\u2019s the United States of America.\u201d\nMrs. Clinton represents a continuation both of Wall Street-captive imperial neoliberalism and of identity politics combining with partisan politics to provide cover for that noxious policy stew.\nThey go back well before Obama\u2019s presidency and indeed prior to his emergence on the national scene.\nHowever, this is the 21st century and race, together with gender and even class, can be very seductive tools of propaganda.\nThe absence of tangible gains for non-affluent Americans is especially glaring in Black America, which turned out for Obama in record numbers in 2008 and 2012."}
