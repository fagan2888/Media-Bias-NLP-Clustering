Steve Litzow, R-Mercer Island, said in a prepared statement. He added:\n\nLegislation to create more uncertainty and reduce the rights of any minority does more to divide us than to bring equality. This provides our state with a powerful opportunity to educate more people about our transgender community members and the struggles and discrimination they already face.\n\nThe repeal bill, sponsored by state Sen. Doug Ericksen, R-Ferndale, was opposed by Litzow and two other Republicans\u2014Joe Fain of Auburn and Andy Hill of Redmond.\n\nS.B. 6443 also would have removed the authority of the Human Rights Commission to \u201cinitiate any rule-making procedure that involves the subject of gender segregated facilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you to the 24 senators who voted to repeal a rule put in place by an unelected board,\u201d Ericksen, the bill\u2019s sponsor, posted on his Facebook page. \u201cThis is not about bathrooms, it is about locker rooms and shower rooms. There will be an initiative filed to overturn this rule.\u201d\n\nSen. Michael Baumgartner, R-Spokane, who voted in favor of repeal, told Associated Press that further legislative action would require a change in state leadership.\n\nThe Human Rights Commission created the rule as a clarification of existing law, which added transgender persons as a protected class in 2006.\n\nThe rule reads:\n\nAll covered entities shall allow individuals the use of gender-segregated facilities, such as restrooms, locker rooms, dressing rooms, and homeless or emergency shelters, that are consistent with that individual\u2019s gender expression or gender identity. In such facilities where undressing in the presence of others occurs, covered entities shall allow access to and use of a facility consistent with that individual\u2019s gender expression or gender identity.\n\nAn earlier draft of the rule said schools must \u201cassess the use of locker rooms by transgendered students on a case-by-case basis,\u201d AP reported.\n\nThe final policy removed an accommodation for public schools and mandated that schools provide transgender students full access to restrooms, locker rooms, and other sex-segregated facilities that correspond to what they consider their gender identity.\n\n\u201cIf another person expresses concern or discomfort about a person who uses a facility that is consistent with the person\u2019s gender expression or gender identity, the person expressing discomfort should be directed to a separate or gender-neutral facility, if available,\u201d the final rule says.\n\nAs previously reported by The Daily Signal, the state Senate\u2019s Commerce and Labor Committee noted in a summary of public testimony that those who supported repeal said the new rule leaves girls and women vulnerable to sexual predators. Those opposed to repeal argued that it would \u201callow for harassment and discrimination of transgender persons.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a single member of the Washington state Senate has suggested transgendered persons are sex predators. But many of us are concerned sex predators will claim to be transgendered,\u201d Sen. Tim Sheldon, D-Potlatch, who supported repeal, said in a press release.\n\nThe rule \u201copens the door, literally, for pedophiles, human traffickers, and sexual assaulters to have unrestricted access to women and girls in showers, locker rooms, and bathrooms,\u201d Angela Connelly, president of the Washington Women\u2019s Network, told The Daily Signal. Connelly added:\n\nWashington state has just, legislatively, without weighing the voice of the people, violated the safety and privacy of women and girls. This is a historic, aggressive attack on the civil rights of women and girls.\n\nThe Washington Women\u2019s Network, which supports victims of sexual assault, announced on its Facebook page that it will join the Safe Spaces for Women and Children Rally at the state Capitol on Monday.\n\nA group called Keep Locker Rooms Safe, on a Facebook event page for the rally, asks readers to \u201cshare stories of survival and tell our legislature that we will not accept this affront on women\u2019s rights.\u201d\n\nThis report has been modified to include a quotation from the bill\u2019s sponsor, Sen.
