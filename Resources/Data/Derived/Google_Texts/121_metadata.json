The National Weather Service issued tornado warnings at 4 p.m., 4:04 and 4:15.\n\nThe tornadoes are \u201cassociated with this really slow-moving storm system over the state now,\u201d said NWS meteorologist Kyle Fredin. \u201cWe are moving into a regular peak for unsettled weather.\u201d\n\nThat unsettled weather is contributing to the continued need for flood warnings caused by a weeks-long spate of rainstorms. Warnings are expected to stay in place for areas along the South Platte and Cache La Poudre rivers through the week, according to the Weather Service.\n\nPortions of east-central and northeast Colorado. east and central Adams and Arapahoe, Phillips, Sedgwick and Washington counties and other areas were under flood watches for most of the day Sunday. \u201cThe Eastern Plains have a host of flood warnings, especially along the Platte and Cache La Poudre,\u201d Fredin said.\n\nAt about 1 p.m. Sunday, residents on the north side of Sterling, who were evacuated early Sunday morning, were told they could return home but cautioned that they should be prepared to leave quickly if expected storms trigger further flooding, the Northeast Public Affairs Collaborative announced.\n\n\u201cAny residents who have received a pre-evacuation or evacuation notice in the past 24 hours should be prepared to leave their area at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d the NPAC, the emergency public information group for northeast Colorado, said on its Facebook page.\n\nOfficials issued the mandatory evacuation order after the North Sterling Reservoir inlet ditch overflowed its banks.\n\nTwenty-seven people spent the night in an American Red Cross shelter.\n\nMost arrived shortly after the evacuation notice went out at about 1:30 a.m., said Melody Storgaard, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross Northern Colorado Chapter. Personnel from both the Sterling police and fire departments went door-to-door to alert residents.\n\nIn Summit County, water is being drained out of Dillon Reservoir to make room for more runoff, which is good news for people in other Western states along the Colorado River.\n\nThe Dillon Reservoir is a big source of Denver\u2019s water supply. But with the Mile High City and Front Range saturated, almost all of the water is heading west. \u201cIt\u2019s really good news for the people in Lake Powell and Lake Mead and downstream that could really use the water,\u201d Dillon Marina manager Bob Evans said.\n\nOfficials in El Paso and Pueblo counties said they will ask Gov. John Hickenlooper for a disaster declaration after being pounded by rain and flooding over the past three weeks.\n\n\u201cWe need some sort of help,\u201d said Tracy Tolle, who farms for Frank Masciantonio in Pueblo County and Clear Spring Ranch in El Paso County. \u201cThat\u2019s our livelihood.\u201d\n\nIn Colorado Springs, groundwater was so high it seeped into basements, damaging carpets and floors.\n\nIn Boulder County, farmers are battling through one of the wettest springs in 20 years, weary of conditions that have made it almost impossible to plant some crops and raising concerns about having to lay off workers.\n\nThunderstorms are expected to continue throughout the week.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t entirely dry out until next weekend,\u201d said NWS meteorologist Todd Dankers. \u201cThere are not going to be any strong drying periods.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tornadoes touch down south of Lamar Sunday afternoon", "title": "Tornadoes touch down south of Lamar Sunday afternoon", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/24/tornadoes-touch-down-south-of-lamar-sunday-afternoon/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-24T08:58:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-24T08:58:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Officials issued the mandatory evacuation order after the North Sterling Reservoir inlet ditch overflowed its banks.\nPortions of east-central and northeast Colorado.\nA trio of tornadoes touched down south of Lamar on Sunday but caused no reported damage.\nThe tornadoes are \u201cassociated with this really slow-moving storm system over the state now,\u201d said NWS meteorologist Kyle Fredin.\nWarnings are expected to stay in place for areas along the South Platte and Cache La Poudre rivers through the week, according to the Weather Service."}
