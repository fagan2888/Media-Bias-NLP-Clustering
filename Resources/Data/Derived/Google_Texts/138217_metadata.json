Think about it this way: Before that stretch, the only previous major title match between sisters came when Maud Watson beat her younger sibling, Lillian, in the very first Wimbledon women\u2019s final in 1884.\n\nThere would be two more all-Williams Grand Slam finals, both at Wimbledon, in 2008 and 2009. But since then, they have not met in any round at any Slam. Until now. No. 1-seeded Serena and No. 16-seeded Venus will reprise their unique rivalry on Monday in the fourth round at Wimbledon.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t know what can happen there. We\u2019ve all seen, a million times, them play. And we\u2019ve seen different results, especially at Wimbledon. You just have no clue,\u201d said Venus\u2019 coach, David Witt. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen good matches. We\u2019ve seen bad matches.\u201d\n\nThis will be their 26th showdown on tour (Serena leads 14-11), their 13th at a major (Serena leads 7-5), and their sixth at Wimbledon (Serena leads 3-2).\n\nIt comes 17 years after their first professional matchup, in the second round of the 1998 Australian Open.\n\nAnd it comes 15 years after their first encounter at the All England Club, in the 2000 semifinals\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re both more mature. Still as tenacious,\u201d said Venus, who won that one en route to the first of her seven career Grand Slam titles, five at Wimbledon. \u201cI mean, back then, we were definitely fun to watch. I think we still are.\u201d\n\nSerena also has won five trophies at the grass-court tournament, part of her collection of 20 major singles championships.\n\nHer narrow escape in the third round Friday against Britain\u2019s Heather Watson \u2014 after trailing by two breaks at 3-0 in the third set, then twice standing two points from defeat at 5-4 \u2014 extended Serena\u2019s Grand Slam winning streak to 24 matches. She is aiming for a fourth consecutive major title, a self-styled \u201cSerena Slam,\u201d and trying to get the third leg of a calendar-year Grand Slam.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just like old times, it\u2019s Williams vs. Williams at Wimbledon", "title": "Just like old times, it\u2019s Williams vs. Williams at Wimbledon", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Just like old times, it\u2019s Williams vs. Williams at Wimbledon", "title": "Just like old times, it\u2019s Williams vs. Williams at Wimbledon", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/04/just_like_old_times_its_williams_vs_williams_at_wimbledon/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/britain-wimbledon-tennis.jpeg40-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Just like old times, it\u2019s Williams vs. Williams at Wimbledon", "title": "Just like old times, it\u2019s Williams vs. Williams at Wimbledon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/britain-wimbledon-tennis.jpeg40-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Howard Fendrich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "During a span of eight majors from the U.S. Open in 2001 to Wimbledon in 2003, Serena and Venus Williams participated in six all-in-the-family Grand Slam finals.\nThere would be two more all-Williams Grand Slam finals, both at Wimbledon, in 2008 and 2009.\nShe is aiming for a fourth consecutive major title, a self-styled \u201cSerena Slam,\u201d and trying to get the third leg of a calendar-year Grand Slam.\nWe\u2019ve seen bad matches.\u201dThis will be their 26th showdown on tour (Serena leads 14-11), their 13th at a major (Serena leads 7-5), and their sixth at Wimbledon (Serena leads 3-2).\nStill as tenacious,\u201d said Venus, who won that one en route to the first of her seven career Grand Slam titles, five at Wimbledon."}
