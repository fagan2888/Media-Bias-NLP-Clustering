Policy Watch Crucial Conversation luncheon:\n\nClosing the health coverage gap for North Carolinians living with substance use disorders\n\nFeaturing Dr. Lonise Bias of the Len and Jay Bias Association and Jeff Matkins of Insight Human Services.\n\nClick here to register\n\nNorth Carolina, along with every other state, has an unprecedented opportunity to expand health coverage to its most vulnerable residents. Currently, 30 states plus the District of Columbia have broadened Medicaid eligibility with financing available from the Affordable Care Act. So far, legislators in North Carolina, along with the Governor, have blocked these federal funds from expanding access to health care, boosting the state\u2019s economy and bolstering rural hospitals.\n\nClosing the health insurance coverage gap in North Carolina would provide better access to medical services and treatment for 500,000 working poor families. Many of the people locked out of the system have treatable, chronic diseases. An estimated 150,000 are living with substance use disorders. Millions in our state are in long-term recovery from addictions and need ongoing support to remain healthy.\n\nJoin us as we discuss these and related issues with two very special experts on the subject:\n\nDr. Lonise Bias is the Founder and President of the Len and Jay Bias Foundation. Through her pain at the loss of two sons, Dr. Bias has created youth and family programs to reclaim the community and has inspired thousands. She will share her story with us about her son, Len Bias\u2019 tragic death of cocaine intoxication in June 1986 just two days after being drafted by the Boston Celtics.\n\nJeff Matkins, Chief Operating Officer of Insight Human Services (formerly known as the Partnership for a Drug Free NC), works with colleagues in 60 counties to provide substance use prevention, intervention and treatment. Jeff will discuss how sound policy decisions such as Medicaid expansion would help provide access to care and improve the lives of thousands of North Carolinians.\n\nClick here to register\n\nWhen: Monday, November 30, at noon \u2014 Box lunches will be available at 11:45 a.m.\n\nWhere: Center for Community Leadership Training Room at the Junior League of Raleigh Building, 711 Hillsborough St. (At the corner of Hillsborough and St. Mary\u2019s streets)\n\nSpace is limited \u2013 pre-registration required.\n\nCost: Thanks to a generous donor, admission is FREE and includes a box lunch.
