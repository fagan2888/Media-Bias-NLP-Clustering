The first is Obamacare. The second is tire labeling. And the third is tire registration.\n\nThe good news? There are still plenty of details to be worked out in all three, which means there is hope that any unreasonable or unmanageable aspects of the laws will be fixed or disregarded. The time lag also will give you plenty of time to adapt. The bad news? Politics can get in the way of logic. Each law has its merits, but when it comes to small business, the government doesn\u2019t always believe in compromise.\n\nNick Mitchell, senior vice president of research for Northcoast Research Holdings LLC, echoed that thought when asked to describe what President Barack Obama\u2019s legacy would be.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama protects tire manufacturers and unions with tariffs, (and) burdens consumers and small businesses (i.e., tire dealers) with the cost.\u201d\n\nObamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act, is already up and running. Once a law is entrenched in society, it is hard to repeal. So don\u2019t count on it being overturned.\n\nOver time, Congress hopefully will improve Obamacare and eliminate the loopholes unfairly detrimental to you. According to one dealer, the coverage for underachieving employees is more expensive than it is for hard-working employees.\n\nBefore tire labeling can go into effect, a national tire fuel efficiency consumer information program for replacement tires has to be established. Although the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration published a \u201cfinal\u201d rule in 2010 specifying the test procedures needed to rate tire performance, there have been delays in its implementation. The comment period on how this information will be made available to consumers ends on March 30th of this year.\n\nMandatory tire registration at the point-of-sale became law when the president signed a five-year highway bill in December. However, a study to examine the feasibility of requiring tire manufacturers to include electronic identification information on every tire, and ensuring all manufacturers use a streamlined format for that information, needs to be completed first. In other words, there is no timetable for enforcement of the law.\n\nAs with many regulations in transition, the wait for the ball to drop can be frustrating. Just remember, history emphatically tells us you can adapt to anything. \u25a0\n\nIf you have any question or comments, please email me at bob.ulrich@bobit.com.\n\nWant to read more of Bob Ulrich's editorials?
