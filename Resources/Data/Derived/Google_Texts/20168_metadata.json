Care Harbor will provide free medical, dental and vision care, as well as follow-up care, to an estimated 1,000 patients each day. The clinic was made possible by a grant and in-kind resources from L.A. Care Health Plan, the nation's largest publicly operated health plan, from Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas (Los Angeles County, Second District), Tzu Chi Medical Foundation and assistance from more than 50 organizations and 3,000 volunteers.\n\n\"Our goal is to create lasting change in the lives of the people we serve by providing sustainable care in addition to the extensive medical, dental and vision services we offer on site,\" said Don Manelli, president and founder of Care Harbor. \"Care Harbor provides prevention education and resources, connects patients needing follow-up care to local medical homes, and conducts a major insurance education and enrollment effort. Through an outpouring of generosity from our community we are able to provide free care for the fifth year in a row to those who desperately need it.\"\n\nAlthough it's a year into healthcare reform, millions still are without access to care, particularly specialty care. Care Harbor is aiming to address this need during the four days of the Care Harbor/LA clinic by providing thousands of medically underserved Angelenos with the opportunity to receive free specialty and prevention care, in addition to free medical, dental and vision care. Moreover, insurance counselors will be onsite to provide information about the various coverage plan options available through the California Marketplace and other resources, and help patients sign up for insurance onsite as open enrollment approaches in the fall.\n\n\"Over the course of the past year, we've seen that the Affordable Care Act is working. In Los Angeles County, the number of uninsured was reduced by more than a million people,\" said Howard A. Kahn, L.A. Care's CEO. \"But, our job is not done. There are still roughly 1-1.3 million uninsured Angelenos and it's our responsibility to help them get the healthcare that they so desperately deserve. Care Harbor goes a long way toward facilitating this, well beyond these four days.\"\n\nEven in this era of healthcare reform, a UCLA and UC Berkeley study showed that approximately 4 million California residents will remain uninsured in 2015, and some 30 million people will remain uninsured by 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n\"The implementation of national health reform has been an enormous boon for the people of Los Angeles County,\" said Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas. \"Thousands who had to endure illnesses and ailments without treatment now have access to medical care. The ACA, however, does not obviate the need for efforts such as Care Harbor. As it does every year, Care Harbor tightens the weave in our health care safety net, ensuring that those with the fewest resources and nowhere else to turn will not fall through.\"\n\nAs in previous years, The Tzu Chi Foundation, is providing equipment for the dental section, dental and vision mobile units, acupuncture, and many other resources in addition to professional volunteers.\n\n\"We've always had great participation from Tzu Chi volunteers, but this year it has increased to new levels,\" said Dr. William Keh, chief executive officer of Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation. \"We hope that this broad interest is a reflection of our work throughout the year to inspire individuals to get involved and help improve the health of our community. We are grateful to our doctors, nurses and volunteers that are joining us to celebrate this remarkable health care event.\"\n\nRepresentatives from more than 50 local clinics and medical practices that provide primary and specialized care will be on site to make appointments for follow-up services before patients leave the clinic. Connecting patients to a medical home during the clinic helps ensure that diagnosed conditions are treated and patients are monitored throughout their treatment plan. Through its last three clinics, Care Harbor/LA provided 43,822 free medical, dental and vision services to more than 10,000 patients and nearly 3,000 of them were connected to medical homes for continuing care, including free surgeries. In addition, all patients received preventive care, the most effective and economical form of healthcare.\n\nCare Harbor thanks L.A.
