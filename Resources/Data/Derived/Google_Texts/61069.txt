With the return of "Crossfire" to CNN, we are taking a closer look into the hosts' lives with a series of Web videos.

In this video, host S.E. Cupp discusses her past as a childhood ballet dancer and her passion for hunting.

Cupp, a ballet dancer since age six, performed with prestigious dance companies until her late teens. “Our Christmases were oriented around when my ‘Nutcracker’ performances were,” Cupp explains. "It was a full time job."

Now, Cupp says she spends much of her free time hunting and fishing. "I guess you wouldn’t know it by looking at me, but that’s what I love doing," Cupp explains. She says these activities have allowed her to combine her love of the outdoors with charity work. During one hunting expedition with female military veterans in Alaska, Cupp described her most memorable catch: “I got to bag a 200-pound black bear. It was awesome.”

"Crossfire" airs on CNN weekdays at 6:30pm ET.
