The Broncos quarterback situation continues to take center stage. Multiple reports confirm that Colin Kaepernick met with John Elway at his house Thursday.

The meeting also happened to take place on the same day the 49ers guaranteed Kaepernick's 11.9 million dollar salary for next season. Meaning San Francisco will not be releasing the quarterback.

Reports also say the team is allowing Kaepernick to seek a trade. This allows other teams to talk to him directly.

Kaepernick has been rehabbing in Vail this off season, and a future in Denver may not be far off.
