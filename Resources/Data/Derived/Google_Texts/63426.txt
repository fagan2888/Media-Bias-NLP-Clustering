Say what you will about the jurisprudence of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but there’s no question that she’s got her priorities straight when it comes to the annual political spectacle known as the State of the Union Address. As The Hill reports, on the night of President Obama’s big speech this year, Ginsburg got a little drunk and fell asleep while the president droned on and on:

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg admits to sharing some wine with her colleagues and not being "100 percent sober" for President Obama's State of the Union address in January.

During Obama's speech, which lasted just under an hour, many viewers on social media pointed out that the 81-year-old liberal justice appeared to be snoozing.

“The audience for the most part is awake, because they’re bobbing up and down, and we sit there, stone-faced, sober judges. But we’re not, at least I wasn’t, 100 percent sober,” Ginsburg said during a talk at George Washington University on Thursday night, according to a report by The Blaze.
