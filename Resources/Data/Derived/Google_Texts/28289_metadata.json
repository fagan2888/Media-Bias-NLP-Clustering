Cremated remains of nine victims of the November 1978 mass suicide at Jonestown, Guyana, were found in the former Minus Funeral Home in Dover, Delaware. They were among more than 900 followers ordered to commit \u201crevolutionary suicide\u201d by their leader (called \u201cfather\u201d), the Rev. Jim Jones.\n\n276 victims were children.\n\n\u201cFor some strange reason, man must always thus plant his fruit trees in a graveyard. Man can only find life among the dead. Man is a misshapen monster, with his feet set forward and his face turned back.\u201d \u2014 G. K. Chesterton\n\nThe Rev. Jones was a devout Marxist. \u201cIf you\u2019re born in capitalist America,\u201d roared Jones in a sermon, \u201cracist America, fascist America, then you\u2019re born in sin. But if you\u2019re born in socialism, you\u2019re not born in sin.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Unclaimed remains of nine Jonestown massacre victims found in funeral home\n\n\n\nJones controlled his San Francisco flock by demanding they sign confessions to crimes they did not commit, as proof of their devotion to him and the socialist movement. And Jones bilked cash from them as well, generally from his poor, African-American parishioners who willingly contributed their Social Security checks.\n\nAnd then there was John Victor Stoen. Born in 1972, infant John was given over to the Jones\u2019 cult for communal raising by his brainwashed parents Tim and Grace Stoen.\n\n\u201cScience has proven how resilient children can be despite great obstacles. And that\u2019s where other adults may step in, to help nurture children and to provide positive role models,\u201d wrote Hillary Clinton in her book, It Takes a Village.\n\nIn 1976, Grace Stoen, having regained her sense of self, fled the Bay Area communal village called the Peoples Temple, but left her son behind.\n\n\u201cI wanted to take John, but I didn\u2019t have him physically and I felt like I didn\u2019t have him psychologically,\u201d she later told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cAll the time John was alive, people were telling me I wasn\u2019t good enough for him, that he was more intelligent than I, that I wasn\u2019t a good mother.\u201d\n\nWhen news organizations began recounting the horror stories of former cult members, Jones decided to move his operation from the prying eyes of the media and the strong arm of American law. The South American nation Guyana had a friendly socialist government, which granted the cult leader more than 824 acres of land and, after a few bribes to local customs officials, gave Jones permission to import firearms and drugs. Jones also whisked young John Stoen to his South American jungle utopia, the Peoples Temple agricultural mission.\n\nREAD ALSO: Magical thinking Americans\n\n\n\nIt was Tim and Grace Stoen\u2019s legal battle to regain custody of their son John that got the attention of California Congressman Leo Ryan, who eventually led a fact-finding delegation to investigate the goings-on at Jonestown.\n\nThough a few Jonestown residents decided to join Rep. Ryan in his return to the U.S., the vast majority remained. But Jones must have felt the few departing congregants posed a threat to his totalitarian jungle experiment, and sent his \u201cRed Brigade\u201d assassins to murder the departing delegation and defectors at a nearby airfield. Five died, including Congressman Ryan.\n\nBack at the jungle compound, Jones ordered his flock to drink poison, others were ordered to murder those that rejected their savior\u2019s bitter cup. According to one survivor, six-year-old John Victor Stoen\u2019s last words were, \u201cI don\u2019t want to die, I don\u2019t want to die.\u201d\n\nJones, like Hitler, pressed the muzzle of a pistol against his temple and pulled the trigger.\n\nWhen authorities entered the death camp the next day, \u201cOverhead swung the sign paraphrasing the philosopher George Santayana: \u2018Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it,\u2019\u201d said the Associated Press.\n\nThe megalomaniac Jim Jones is the least fascinating aspect of the Jonestown story. That so many people were willing to place their lives, fortunes and children in the hands of a maniac are the saga\u2019s most striking element.\n\n\u201cPeople who see their lives as irremediably spoiled cannot find a worthwhile purpose in self-advancement,\u201d wrote Eric Hoffer in his book The True Believer. \u201cThey look on self-interest as on something tainted and evil; something unclean and unlucky. Anything undertaken under the auspices of the self seems to them foredoomed. Nothing that has its roots and reasons in the self can be noble and good. Their innermost craving is for a new life \u2014 a rebirth \u2014 or, failing this, a chance to acquire new elements of pride, confidence, hope, a sense of purpose and worth by an identification with a holy cause.\u201d\n\nTim Stoen, father of dead John Stoen, had doubts about remaining a member of the Peoples Temple one year after joining the cult. And so, Jones had him write an essay to help expunge his qualms. \u201cSocialism sees the individual as existing on behalf of the community,\u201d wrote Stoen, \u201che is not an elitist.\u201d\n\nIt took a certain kind of person to join the Peoples Temple. Those who lost their individuality and sought meaning in a group. Jim Jones, the ultimate community organizer \u2014 that is to say, the ultimate egoist \u2014 determined every aspect of their lives and, in the end, determined the exact moment of their death.\n\n\u201cA man is likely to mind his own business when it is worth minding,\u201d wrote Eric Hoffer. \u201cWhen it is not, he takes his mind off his own meaningless affairs by minding other people\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nThe ashes of nine cultists, the objects of Jone\u2019s \u201cminding,\u201d sit unclaimed in a shuttered Delaware funeral home, forgotten \u2014 a second death that followed the tragic, suicidal annihilation of their individuality.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A chilling story recently flashed across the Associated Press news wire.
