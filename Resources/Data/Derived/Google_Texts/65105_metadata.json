District 113 is conducting a search for a new superintendent, among other leadership positions within the district.\n\nSwanson, now an assistant superintendent for Glenbrook High School District 225, was arrested in connection with a DUI early Thanksgiving morning.\n\nDold gets second chance\n\nU.S. Rep. Brad Schneider, the Deerfield Democrat representing the 10th Congressional District, was ousted after only one term in office, losing to a familiar foe in Bob Dold in the mid-term elections.\n\nDold, a Kenilworth Republican who was first elected to the office in 2010, was edged out by Schneider in 2012.\n\nDuring the tightly-contested campaign, Schneider assailed Dold's voting record, particularly on the Affordable Care Act, depicting him as a reliable Republican vote.\n\nDold stuck to his campaign message that he was a moderate, though, and ultimately celebrated the Election Night win surrounded by supporters at Austin's Saloon and Eatery in Libertyville.\n\nInfrastructure improvements (or not)\n\nIn Deerfield, the long-awaited reconstruction of Deerfield Road was pushed back to 2016.\n\nNow slated to begin in 2016, the Deerfield Road reconstruction project involves replacement of existing water mains, storm and sanitary sewers, and traffic signals, between Rosemary Terrace in Deerfield and Ridge Road in Highland Park, according to village board documents.\n\nThe project also includes the pavement patching, grinding and resurfacing of the road between the Metra underpass and Rosemary Terrace.\n\nThe estimated cost for the Deerfield Road project is $15 million with engineering included, officials have said, but Deerfield will only pay about $1.5 million for construction and an additional $200,000 or so for engineering.\n\nIn Highland Park, planned security improvements at the water treatment facility sparked community uproar.\n\nIn the fall, city officials announced the recommended closing of Park Avenue boating facility in order to tighten up security at the plant, which provides water for 129,000 residents in Highland Park and other communities, officials have said.\n\nThe problem?\n\nThat's the only boat launch in town. Many dozens of boaters objected to its closure and the city subsequently eased off its recommendation. Now a park district task force is studying a possible compromise between access and security.\n\nTragedies new and old\n\nIn September, Highland Park woman Carly Rousso was sentenced to five years in prison for abusing inhalants while driving, before running over and killing a 5-year-old girl in Highland Park.\n\nThe sentencing brought closure to the lengthy legal process following the Labor Day 2012 crash. Rousso had swerved from the road after huffing chemicals, striking Jaclyn Santos-Sacramento, 5, and her family as they walked on the sidewalk.\n\nRousso was found guilty of reckless homicide and aggravated drunken driving.\n\nAfter the sentencing, the Jaclyn's parents said they were disappointed by what they perceived to be a light punishment for Rousso.\n\n\"Seeing my daughter killed in front of me is something I cannot put into words,\" said Modesta Sacramento Jimenez in a statement.\n\nAnother family was reeling from loss after the Nov. 3 shooting of Christopher Anderson, a Waukegan man killed by Highland Park police.\n\nAnderson, 27, drew a gun on police at NorthShore Highland Park Hospital, officials have said. Police fired nine shots after he refused to drop the weapon. Anderson's 9-year-old daughter was receiving medical treatment at the hospital, but was not present when the shooting took place.\n\nAfter an investigation into the incident, the Lake County State's Attorney's Office determined the shooting to be justified.\n\nOn a lighter note\n\nA pony-tailed figure skater from Highland Park emerged onto the international stage during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.\n\nJason Brown captured the hearts of his hometown fans with his humble and enthusiastic demeanor, and inspired new fans globally with his exuberant \"Riverdance\" routine.\n\nBrown helped the U.S. team to a bronze medal in the team figure skating event and came within striking distance of a bronze in the individual competition before finishing ninth overall.\n\n\"People ask me about the sacrifices I've made, but I never really look at any part of my journey as a sacrifice,\" Brown told Highland Park High School students at a rally upon return home. \"If you love what you're doing, then it really isn't a sacrifice.\"", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "2014 in review: Highland Park and Deerfield", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "The past year was marked by both controversy and considerable change in Highland Park and Deerfield .", "title": "2014 in review: Highland Park and Deerfield", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/highland-park/ct-highland-park-deerfield-year-in-review-tl-20141217-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5490c579/turbine/ct-highland-park-deerfield-year-in-review-tl-20141217", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp05.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Highland Park, Deerfield", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/82310892", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2014-12-16", "Description": "The past year was marked by both controversy and considerable change in Highland Park and Deerfield.
