Mehuse, executive chairman of CieloStar, just before the chamber announcement at its fourth annual health care conference today in Richmond.\n\nBarry DuVal, president and chief executive officer of the Virginia Chamber, said the new marketplace will allow employers to select a health insurance carrier and a range of other benefits from which employees can select, using a \u201cdefined contribution\u201d by their employers.\n\n\u201cIt moves from employer driven to employee driven,\u201d he said.\n\nThe program also will rely on private insurance brokers to bring employers into the Virginia Benefits Market, DuVal said. \u201cBrokers are the delivery mechanism. They\u2019re the ones who advise small businesses.\u201d\n\nHealth care has become a dominant issue for the Virginia Chamber, which is unique among other state chambers of commerce for devoting an annual conference to the subject from both health industry and political viewpoints.\n\nThe Virginia Chamber has taken a stand in favor of reforming and expanding the state\u2019s Medicaid program, preferably through the private insurance marketplace advocated by the state Senate in its ongoing battle over the issue with Republicans in the House of Delegates.\n\nGov. Terry McAuliffe and Secretary of Health and Human Resources Bill Hazel delivered a one-two punch in keynote speeches to more than 500 people at the conference today.\n\nMcAuliffe emphasized the business and financial case for expanding health coverage to hundreds of thousands of uninsured Virginians in the so-called \u201ccoverage gap.\u201d\n\nPeople in the coverage gap don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid under the state\u2019s current, stringent standards but also aren\u2019t eligible for federal subsidies to buy insurance in the new federally operated marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe have a first-class health care system, but if our citizens don\u2019t have access to it, what good is it?\u201d McAuliffe asked.\n\nThe governor again called for House Republicans to compromise on coverage so that Virginia can recover $20 billion in additional taxes that state residents and businesses will pay over the next eight years under the health care law to finance expansion of Medicaid eligibility in states that choose to do so.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about leaving $20 billion of taxpayer money on the table,\u201d he said, noting that Virginia already has forfeited an estimated $767 million of federal money this year by not expanding coverage.\n\nMcAuliffe vowed to prevail on the issue, despite determined opposition from House Republicans. He has not ruled out expanding coverage by executive action, but wants the General Assembly to reach a compromise.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get this done, folks,\u201d he said. \u201cI promise you that.\u201d\n\nWhile McAuliffe focused on the business reasons for expanding coverage, Hazel talked about the importance to improving health care delivery and controlling costs.\n\n\u201cThis is money that needs to come back because we have needs here,\u201d said Hazel, a former orthopedic surgeon who served as secretary under then-Gov. Bob McDonnell before being reappointed by McAuliffe this year.\n\nHazel said the United States spends too much of its gross domestic product on health care while failing to cover a big portion of the population.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t fix that without finding a rational way to take care of these people in the gap,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "NewsAdvance.com", "description": "The Virginia Chamber of Commerce is reaching out to small businesses to create a private health insurance marketplace for their employees.", "title": "Virginia Chamber announces insurance exchange for small businesses", "url": "http://www.newsadvance.com/work_it_lynchburg/news/virginia-chamber-announces-insurance-exchange-for-small-businesses/article_4835a064-ecd3-11e3-8f0f-0017a43b2370.html", "image": "http://www.newsadvance.com/app/newsadvance-facebook-og-image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@newsadvance", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 327783079478}, "keywords": "news", "news_keywords": "news", "description": "The Virginia Chamber of Commerce is reaching out to small businesses to create a private health insurance marketplace for their employees."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0082\"", "article_summary": "The Virginia Chamber of Commerce is reaching out to small businesses to create a private health insurance marketplace for their employees.\nThe chamber today announced the creation of the Virginia Benefits Market, an insurance exchange through which employers with little buying power can offer a menu of health benefits to their employees.\nThe program also will rely on private insurance brokers to bring employers into the Virginia Benefits Market, DuVal said.\nThe market is a partnership between the state chamber and ChamberSolutions, a 22-year-old cooperative among 60 local chambers that currently provides insurance benefits for 20,000 employees in Virginia.\nHe has not ruled out expanding coverage by executive action, but wants the General Assembly to reach a compromise."}
