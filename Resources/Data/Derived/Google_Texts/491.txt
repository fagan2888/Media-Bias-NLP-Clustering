Santa Barbara infant dies from whooping cough

January 15, 2015

A newborn baby died last month from whooping cough in Santa Barbara — the second death in a year as California deals with an epidemic.

The 25-day-old infant became ill in December and died shortly afterwards. California health officials recorded 10,831 cases in 2014.

Whooping cough causes uncontrollable, violent coughing.

Pertussis is cyclical and peaks every 3 to 5 years. Over the past three years, San Luis Obispo County has had the following number of pertussis cases:

2012 – 14 cases

2013 – 17 cases

2014 – 43 cases
