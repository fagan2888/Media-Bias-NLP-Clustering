Blue Care Network premiums in West Michigan will increase an average of 1.4 percent.\n\nProjected decreases are larger for Jan. 1, 2016 renewals: 2.2 percent on average for Blue Cross Blue Shield clients statewide, and an average of 4.8 percent for Blue Care Network policies. West Michigan small businesses could see premiums decrease 1.35 percent for Blues policies and 3.95 percent for Blue Care Network in 2016.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield previously planned to implement a 2 percent rate increase for policies renewing with the second or third quarter.\n\nActual premium adjustments will vary based on employers\u2019 benefits packages and where they are located in the state. Averages also are calculated prior to employers making any changes in their benefits package when they renew policies.\n\nThe small group market affects employers with up to 50 full-time equivalents (FTEs). Blue Cross Blue Shield has 60,941 policies in the small group market covering 131,968 lives, according to the rate filing.\n\nThe reductions, albeit small, follow a period of moderating premium increases that have now led to decreases, which Blue Cross Blue Shield attributes to several factors. Among them is a lower-than-expected medical claims trend from when Blue Cross Blue Shield first filed 2015-16 rates with state regulators a year ago.\n\n\u201cWe are always monitoring what\u2019s happening with our customers. It\u2019s good news when lower-than-expected costs allow you to pass along lower prices to customers, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing now with these midstream rate changes,\u201d said John Dunn, vice president for middle and small group business at Blue Cross Blue Shield.\n\nPriority Health also cites \u201csomewhat better than expected\u201d claims experience for seeking approval to implement a \u201csmall rate decrease\u201d for the last half of 2015, according to an actuarial memo filed with the rate request.\n\nPriority Health then proposed to drop rates by a statewide average of 2.1 percent for 2016 for its small group HMO and point-of-service plans, according to its rate filing.\n\nRick Murdock, executive director of the Michigan Association of Health Plans, suspects the rate proposals from Blue Cross Blue Shield and Priority Health also reflect increased competitiveness that \u201cmay be playing a larger role in the individual and small market now than previously,\u201d he wrote in an email to MiBiz.\n\nCost-control efforts have also helped to moderate medical claims trends at Blue Cross Blue Shield. Just this week, an article in the industry publication Health Affairs highlighted a study on Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s patient-centered medical home initiative that\u2019s credited with avoiding $50 million in costs in 2013.\n\nThe federal Affordable Care Act, by requiring all health insurers to accept anyone seeking coverage no matter their health status, also has eased adverse selection that Blue Cross Blue Shield says left it with a risk pool that was the costliest to insure. Prior to the ACA\u2019s passage, Blue Cross Blue Shield previously was the only carrier in Michigan required by state law to issue policies to everyone.\n\n\u201cThe ACA has definitely put some stability into how the rates are set,\u201d said Nicole Winters-Smith, director of business segment performance for Blue Cross Blue Shield\u2019s middle and small group sales. \u201cThere is no longer an opportunity for other carriers to rate based on previous conditions or to even exclude coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Everybody has the same factors to rate with. So that does level the playing field a bit.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Priority Health each plan to trim health insurance premiums for small businesses beginning with the third or fo...", "generator": "runengine.com", "title": "Blue Cross, Priority Health to reduce health insurance premiums for small business in Michigan", "og": {"url": "https://mibiz.com/item/22395-blue-cross,-priority-health-to-reduce-health-insurance-premiums-for-small-business-in-michigan", "image": "http://mibiz.com/media/k2/items/cache/6984d711bb5548a9a9a6c552adeffe1d_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Priority Health each plan to trim health insurance premiums for small businesses beginning with the third or fo...", "title": "Blue Cross, Priority Health to reduce health insurance premiums for small business in Michigan"}, "image": "https://mibiz.com/media/k2/items/cache/6984d711bb5548a9a9a6c552adeffe1d_S.jpg", "rights": "www.MiBiz.com", "author": "Mark Sanchez", "keywords": "health insurance,Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan,Priority Health", "original-source": "https://mibiz.com/item/22395-blue-cross,-priority-health-to-reduce-health-insurance-premiums-for-small-business-in-michigan"}, "article_summary": "Cost-control efforts have also helped to moderate medical claims trends at Blue Cross Blue Shield.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Priority Health each plan to trim health insurance premiums for small businesses beginning with the third or fourth quarter policy renewals.\nAmong them is a lower-than-expected medical claims trend from when Blue Cross Blue Shield first filed 2015-16 rates with state regulators a year ago.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield has 60,941 policies in the small group market covering 131,968 lives, according to the rate filing.\nThe reductions, albeit small, follow a period of moderating premium increases that have now led to decreases, which Blue Cross Blue Shield attributes to several factors."}
