Local rodent Flatiron Freddy, who made his entrance via zip line, didn't see his shadow today thanks to cloudy skies, opening up the possibility that winter is coming to an end.

A small group gathered in the chilly early morning at Chautauqua on Groundhog Day to see if Freddy, a stuffed yellow bellied marmot, would see his shadow.

Boulder's Open Space and Mountain Parks rangers led a short hike and a program on the day's history before introducing Freddy.

In Pennsylvania, the groundhog Punxsutawney Phil emerged from his burrow today and did see his shadow, predicting six more weeks of winter -- on the East Coast, anyway.
