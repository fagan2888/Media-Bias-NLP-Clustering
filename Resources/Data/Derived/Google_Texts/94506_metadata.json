That risk now belongs to the district \u2014 up to a point, Werling said.\n\nWerling said she is currently shopping through quotes for a second, stop-loss insurance policy, which will activate when expenses from a catastrophic claim become too much for the district to handle independently. She said the fail-safe policy will be contractually obligated to cover everything the employees' day-to-day policy handles.\n\nBesides maintaining the funding to bankroll its employees' average amount of claims, Werling said the district will maintain a reserve fund of between 9 and 12 percent specifically for health insurance. But, with a stop-loss policy in place, she said there should be no possibility of a worst-case scenario breaking the district's bank.\n\nDuring the meeting, board member Arlen Gould praised the move, especially because it maintains the district's coverage of mental health. On Monday, he said the most important change was simple: up-front savings.\n\n\"What this does is allow us to escape that fee,\" Gould said.\n\nWerling's memo notes that Blue Cross remains the district's partner, serving only in the role of claims administrator.\n\nrwachter@pioneerlocal.com\n\nTwitter: @RonnieAtPioneer", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "District 21 aims to save cash through self-insurance", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "With no drop-off in coverage, and without any public complaint from those who are being covered, Community Consolidated Elementary District 21 says it's going to cut more than $600,000 out of its annual insurance costs.", "title": "District 21 aims to save cash through self-insurance", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/buffalo-grove/news/ct-bgc-district-21-insurance-tl-0303-20160302-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56d74ccc/turbine/ct-bgc-district-21-insurance-tl-0303-20160302", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp02.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "District 21, Wheeling, Buffalo Grove, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Blue Cross Blue Shield, BCBS, mental health", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/86086567", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-03-02", "Description": "District 21 should be able to save more than $600,000 annually by providing health and dental coverage itself.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "District 21, Wheeling, Buffalo Grove, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Blue Cross Blue Shield, BCBS, mental health"}, "article_summary": "In a traditional, fully-insured system, the district paid Blue Cross a flat rate, and Blue Cross assumed the risk of paying for major expenses as they arose.\nMary Werling, District 21's assistant superintendent for finance, said their educators would maintain identical plans and benefits, but without the extra costs.\nWerling's memo notes that Blue Cross remains the district's partner, serving only in the role of claims administrator.\nBut, with a stop-loss policy in place, she said there should be no possibility of a worst-case scenario breaking the district's bank.\nWerling said she is currently shopping through quotes for a second, stop-loss insurance policy, which will activate when expenses from a catastrophic claim become too much for the district to handle independently."}
