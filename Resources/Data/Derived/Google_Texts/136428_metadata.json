Health care employment was relatively flat during the recession from about 2009 through 2011, but has climbed steadily since. Likewise, the local health care sector's gross regional product, or GRP, grew steadily from 2000 until 2006, tapered off during the recession before ultimately recovering. Today, the GRP is nearly $14 billion, representing a 25%, or $3 billion, growth from 2000 until 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Jacob Duritsky, Team NEO's managing director of research, said it's clear that the rapid employment growth of the past 14 years has begun to slow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, a mixed bag\n\nThat news shouldn't be particularly surprising, considering hospitals and other medical institutions have been under increased pressure to reduce costs in the face of the Affordable Care Act. Just last year, the Clinic announced it would cut $330 million from its budget and offered early retirement packages to 3,000 employees \u2014 an offer nearly 700 employees accepted. Summa Health System and Akron General Health System also reduced their staffs within the last year.\u201cBy reducing excessive costs in health care, we end up damaging one of the strongest industries in the region,\u201d said Mark Votruba, a Case Western Reserve associate professor who studies health care economics.Across the country, Votruba said he expects employment in the health care sector to grow, particularly as the system braces for an influx in newly insured patients under the Affordable Care Act. However, he expects the growth in Northeast Ohio to be tempered, considering the region already has a robust system in place \u2014 particularly in MetroHealth \u2014 for caring for the uninsured.Meanwhile, as regional health care employment has grown since 2000, so has research spending. Since 2000, total research expenditures by medical institutions and universities have increased from $370 million to $660 million in 2012, according to the most recent data compiled by Team NEO.\u201cThis is really the unique component you can't get elsewhere,\u201d Duritsky said.\n\nTeam NEO's report on overall employment was mixed. The total number of workers employed during the fourth quarter of 2013 rose slightly, one-half of 1%, increasing from 1,891,317 to 1,900,962. While that's the 14th consecutive quarter of employment growth, the labor force still hasn't recovered from the recession.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you go back to the fourth quarter of 2007, when the recession officially started, (employment is) still below that point by about 100,000 workers,\u201d Duritsky said. Team NEO reported 2,010,991 employed workers for the third quarter of 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnemployment rose slightly, from 7.0% in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 7.1% in the like quarter of 2013. At the same time, unemployment nationally dropped from 7.5% to 6.7%. The drop in unemployment nationally was attributed by many economists to an increase in the number of people dropping out of the labor force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam NEO also reported a steady increase in oil and gas drilling in the southern counties in its 18-county region. Northeast Ohio had 462 producing wells at the end of the second quarter of 2014, compared with 422 a year earlier More significantly, the number of well permits issued in the second quarter rose to 143, compared with 26 a year earlier and 64 in the first quarter of 2014.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Employment in Northeast Ohio's health care sector has surged upward since the turn of the millennium, though it appears that growth has begun to slow, according to the latest quarterly report from Team Northeast Ohio, the regional business attraction nonprofit.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Cleveland Business", "description": "Employment in Northeast Ohio's health care sector has surged upward since the turn of the millennium, though it appears that growth has begun to slow, according to the latest quarterly report from Team Northeast Ohio, the regional business attraction nonprofit.", "title": "Northeast Ohio health care job growth slows", "url": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20140706/SUB1/307069982/northeast-ohio-health-care-job-growth-slows", "image": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/assets/cc/CCLB_Iconv2.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainscleveland", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#a91d38", "fb": {"app_id": 730748806957003}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "SUB", "published_time": "2014-07-06T04:30:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-07T15:41:00-04:00", "author": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/staff/11"}, "verify-v1": "Q00KiEdlx7oJ8JL4E1sfoHDh6tgQLZQyOh8A1oVCsIs=", "theme-color": "#a91d38"}, "article_summary": "Health care employment was relatively flat during the recession from about 2009 through 2011, but has climbed steadily since.\nToday, Northeast Ohio's health care sector employs almost 177,000 workers \u2014 an increase of about 20% from 2000's numbers.\nLikewise, the local health care sector's gross regional product, or GRP, grew steadily from 2000 until 2006, tapered off during the recession before ultimately recovering.\nNortheast Ohio is regarded across the country as a health care hub, and it's no secret that the region's health care sector \u2014 anchored by heavyweights like the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals \u2014 did much of the heavy lifting during the Great Recession as other sectors, like manufacturing, shed jobs.\nEmployment in Northeast Ohio's health care sector has surged upward since the turn of the millennium, though it appears that growth has begun to slow, according to the latest quarterly report from Team Northeast Ohio, the regional business attraction nonprofit."}
