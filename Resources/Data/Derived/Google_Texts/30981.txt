"The creation of modern medicine was both costly and valuable, raising spending (from 4% of GDP to 15%) and longevity (from 47 to 78 years) during the last century (Fogel, 2004). Examination of events over 10â€“20 years is not sufficient to understand a 'medical transformation' that arose from a demographic transition and industrial revolution that took centuries to unfold, nor to forecast the likely path of spending over the next 50 years," Getzen wrote.
