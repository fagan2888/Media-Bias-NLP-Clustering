She claims the government is suppressing our radiation levels \u2014 hiding the truth! \u2026 She claims that certain men on the Internet are warning their listeners about the radiation levels.\u201d\n\nShe wanted to know if this was true and, if not, how to calm her friend\u2019s fears\n\nThe friend\u2019s information likely comes from a Dec. 12 report at WND.com, formerly WorldNetDaily. It said:\n\n\u201cA private organization that monitors radiation data from network points across the United States issued email alerts today for two Western U.S. cities, Reno, Nev., and St. George, Utah.\n\n\u201cThe alerts came from the Nuclear Emergency Tracking Center. \u2026\n\n\u201cIn Reno, \u2018the current background radiation level has increased suddenly by more than 200 points from the typical average.\u2019 \u2026\n\n\u201cIn Reno, the (counts per minute) suddenly surged to 462. The all-time high is 542. The average is 279 \u2026\u201d\n\nIt included a screenshot map from the Nuclear Emergency Tracking Center\u2019s website NETC.com showing many sites designated with radiation symbols in the lowest \u201cnorm\u201d range. The map also shows two dozen sites in the \u201crising\u201d range, a dozen in the \u201celevated\u201d range and four in the highest \u201cconcern/watch\u201d range, one of which is Reno.\n\nNETC.com founder Harlan Yother told Fact Checker:\n\n\u201cYour town, Reno, may have a radiation snow problem. For the past three years, according to EPA\u2019s Radnet system that NETC.com uses to build the charts, it shows that each year in December or January, the radiation increases to the highest level for that year. Three times in three years, the snow is radioactive. \u2026 The government will say that it is within its NORM \u2014 natural occurring radioactive material \u2014 background level. That is the same thing the Japanese government is telling its people, it is safe!\u201d\n\nYother emphasized he has no special knowledge in radiation or medicine. His expertise is in computers.\n\nHe said his alert levels are not based on any danger criteria, just his own personal levels signifying different amounts of increase, and that the site is not a medical danger system.\n\nTo learn more, Fact Checker spoke with Ted Hartwell, manager for the Desert Research Institute\u2019s Community Environmental Monitoring Program in Las Vegas. The program oversees a network of radiation and weather monitoring stations in communities surrounding the Nevada National Security Site, aka the Nevada Test Site.\n\nHartwell is familiar with the NECT website. He doesn\u2019t have an issue with Yother\u2019s numbers or claims of higher radiation levels when it snows.\n\nSnow and rain everywhere in the world cause similar small spikes and are not something to worry about, he said, adding that low-pressure systems release radon from the ground.\n\n\u201cMy main concerns with (Yother\u2019s) website have to do with his alert levels,\u201d Hartwell said. \u201cEven for the highest alert level, the range is within the natural variability.\u201d\n\nIn the December alert, Yother\u2019s figures show Reno\u2019s radiation level jumped 72 percent, and this caused the most serious warning from his site.\n\nBut Hartwell said there are places on Earth with 10,000 percent higher natural background radiation without problems for residents.\n\nIf background radiation spiked 100,000 percent higher than average and you stood in the middle for an hour, Hartwell said, that exposure would be equivalent to two to three dental X-rays to the entire body or a few cross-country plane flights.\n\nThere\u2019s a spike in radiation when flying because of more cosmic radiation, thanks to the thinner blanket of atmosphere between you and outer space. This is why cities with higher elevations have more background radiation.\n\nUniversity of Nevada, Reno radiation safety officer Myung Jo said Reno has two to three times more cosmic background radiation than San Francisco.\n\nIn other words, simply driving from San Francisco to Reno causes a \u201cspike\u201d in background radiation that is three to four times higher than the spike Yother\u2019s website warned about.\n\nThis is why Jo thinks Yother\u2019s website is creating fear where none is warranted.\n\nFurther, Jo disagrees there was a 72 percent spike in December. He showed Fact Checker a Radnet chart using the numbers that formed the basis for Yother\u2019s alert. A spike is not noticeable.\n\nJo also said UNR\u2019s radiation sensors did not show such a spike. He said even if that spike had been detected, it was such a small amount that it wouldn\u2019t warrant scrutiny.\n\nWhen asked why Radnet\u2019s plotting of the data didn\u2019t show the spike, Yother said, \u201cThe difference is we calculate the background radiation and then we can detect any changes. We recalculate the average every night \u2014 we take the previous three months and do some special calculations on it to calculate the background radiation.\u201d\n\nTo learn the results requires a subscription to Yother\u2019s website, where he also sells customized Geiger counters.\n\nJo said, \u201cPeople want their radiation exposure to be zero, but it can\u2019t because radiation is everywhere.\u201d\n\nIncreased levels of background radiation have not been shown to be harmful.\n\nA study in the October 2000 Journal of Radiation Research followed more than 100,000 people for 16 years in high background-radiation areas (HBRA) of China. The conclusion:\n\n\u201cWe did not find any increased cancer risk associated with the high levels of natural radiation in HBRA. On the contrary, the mortality of all cancers in HBRA was generally lower than that in the control area, but not statistically significant.\u201d (Emphasis mine.)\n\nBut maybe the government is hiding high radiation numbers?\n\nJo said, \u201cRadiation detection is so easy and so many people have detection systems, there\u2019s no reason to hide (spikes). And it\u2019s not just this country. There are international bodies everywhere monitoring radiation, so it would be very difficult to hide.\u201d\n\nThe verdict\n\nEven if NECT\u2019s Reno radiation numbers are accurate, the increase is still far below amounts that would prompt a health concern and far less than would be seen with a few plane trips or moving to Ouray, Colo. There is no cause for worry.\n\nTruth meter: 1 (out of 10)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reno Nevada News - rgj.com is the home page of Reno Nevada with in depth and updated Reno local news.
