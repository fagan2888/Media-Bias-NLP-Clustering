The site received wildlife habitat certification in 2010, which is up for renewal this year.\n\n\u201cThere are 500 acres of wildlife between the two properties,\u201d said park district naturalist Dottie Drockton, during a recent free tour on the old dump.\n\nThough the weather wasn\u2019t ideal to see rare insects inhabiting the site - emerald dragonflies, damselflies and tiger beetles, to name a few - several of the birds attracted by the grassland habitat were spotted by the group.\n\n\u201cThe main one is the bobolink,\u201d park district Naturalist Linda Gilbert said. \u201cWe just saw a male perched on a post down there with food in its beak, which means they\u2019re nesting here, which is a very cool thing.\u201d\n\nAlso seen and heard were a variety of uncommon sparrows, such as a grasshopper sparrow singing away from the top of a methane gas extraction well cap. The 43 ground-water monitoring wells, plunging 30 to 190 feet deep, also serve as potential perches, along with providing an environmental gauge.\n\n\u201cWe have all kinds of data that tells what\u2019s going on under the landfill,\u201d said Timothy Haaf, construction/maintenance manager for Waste Management\u2019s closed Midwest sites.\n\nThe site also is home to a high-quality stream, Caves Creek, and a wide range of thriving vegetation. The view from the summit of the vegetative cap - emerging like a man-made mountain from the surrounding landscape - is stunning.\n\n\u201cYou can see downtown Cleveland on a clear day,\u201d said Haaf, who clearly relishes his visits to the property.\n\nThere are about 100 closed Waste Management landfill sites in the United States. The Houston-based company operates 240 landfills in the nation.\n\n\u201cMy responsibility is to maintain the site in compliance with post-closure care requirements as approved by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency,\u201d Haaf said. The company is required by EPA permit to maintain the site for 30 years after closure. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean we have no responsibility after that. We have to demonstrate that the site is non-polluting or doesn\u2019t have the potential to pollute.\u201d\n\nHe said it costs about $200,000 a year to manage the site. Maintenance challenges include power outages in the area and evolving regulations.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine, since 1929, a lot of rules have changed,\u201d Haaf said.\n\n\u201cEventually the landfill will dry up and you don\u2019t have any potential to contaminate any water sources,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The News-Herald, http://www.news-herald.com/jrc-html/index/index_p33.html", "article_metadata": {"description": "Who would have thought that 200 acres of rot could amount to anything good?", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Who would have thought that 200 acres of rot could amount to anything good?", "title": "New habitat takes root above old Ohio landfill", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/14/new-habitat-takes-root-above-old-ohio-landfill/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/14/f3d4bfe3412c1717570f6a7067000ec2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/14/f3d4bfe3412c1717570f6a7067000ec2.jpg", "description": "Who would have thought that 200 acres of rot could amount to anything good?", "card": "summary", "title": "New habitat takes root above old Ohio landfill"}, "Author": "BETSY SCOTT", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The company consulted Geauga Park District, which owns neighboring Orchard Hills Park, and Wildlife Habitat Council representatives on how to nurture nature along.\nThe site received wildlife habitat certification in 2010, which is up for renewal this year.\n\u201cThere are 500 acres of wildlife between the two properties,\u201d said park district naturalist Dottie Drockton, during a recent free tour on the old dump.\n\u201cThe main one is the bobolink,\u201d park district Naturalist Linda Gilbert said.\n\u201cEventually the landfill will dry up and you don\u2019t have any potential to contaminate any water sources,\u201d he said."}
