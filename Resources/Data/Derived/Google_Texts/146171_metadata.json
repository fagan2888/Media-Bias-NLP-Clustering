The rub is that most states declined to set up their own marketplaces, in a show of opposition to the Affordable Care Act. So, their residents use the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service, in crafting regulations concerning the subsidies, interpreted the law to permit subsidies for plans purchased on the federal site, as well. The Supreme Court must decide whether the IRS regulation is in step with the text of the law.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a coin toss,\u201d said Mr. Adler, who was among the first to highlight the discrepancy, in a 2011 paper. But he expects that Chief Justice John Roberts will write the majority opinion, as he did in the Supreme Court\u2019s first ruling on the Affordable Care Act, in 2012. In a surprise ruling, Chief Justice Roberts joined the court\u2019s four liberals to uphold the linchpin of the law \u2014 its requirement that Americans carry health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nMr. Chemerinsky, an expert in constitutional law, predicted a similar outcome this time around. He expects a 6-3 vote, with Chief Justice Roberts writing the majority opinion holding that tax credits are available to those who purchase insurance from a federally created exchange.\n\nMr. Pierce, an expert in administrative law and regulation, also expects a 6-3 decision, with Justice Samuel Alito, Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Clarence Thomas in the minority. He said Justice Anthony Kennedy and Chief Justice Roberts will probably write a separate opinion \u201cthat relies heavily\u201d on the argument made by Abbe Gluck, a professor at Yale Law School. Ms. Gluck, who declined to make her own prediction, has argued that the subsidies must be available to people who use the federal exchange, because Congress never provided the states with clear notice of the consequences of declining to establish marketplaces.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this post said Professor Jonathan Adler was among the first to write about legal issues relating to the subsidies in a paper published in 2013. He first wrote about the topic in 2011.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "As we wait for the Supreme Court to render its decision in the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act, we asked a panel of experts to give use their predictions.", "title": "Prediction Panel: Chief Justice Roberts Will Surprise (Again)", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/06/22/prediction-panel-chief-justice-roberts-will-surprise-again/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HF449_ROBERT_G_20150303172049.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Prediction Panel: Chief Justice Roberts Will Surprise (Again)", "description": "As we wait for the Supreme Court to render its decision in the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act, we asked a panel of experts to give use their predictions.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Joe Palazzolo", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Law Blog Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Law Blog", "article.summary": "As we wait for the Supreme Court to render its decision in the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act, we asked a panel of experts to give use their predictions.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-06-22T14:20:43-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/06/22/prediction-panel-chief-justice-roberts-will-surprise-again/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-LB-51555", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "As we wait for the Supreme Court to render its decision in the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act, we asked a panel of experts to give use their predictions.", "title": "Prediction Panel: Chief Justice Roberts Will Surprise (Again)", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2015/06/22/prediction-panel-chief-justice-roberts-will-surprise-again/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HF449_ROBERT_G_20150303172049.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Law Blog", "article.id": "BL-LB-51555", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-06-23T13:54:26-04:00"}, "article_summary": "In a surprise ruling, Chief Justice Roberts joined the court\u2019s four liberals to uphold the linchpin of the law \u2014 its requirement that Americans carry health insurance or pay a penalty.\nHe expects a 6-3 vote, with Chief Justice Roberts writing the majority opinion holding that tax credits are available to those who purchase insurance from a federally created exchange.\nHe said Justice Anthony Kennedy and Chief Justice Roberts will probably write a separate opinion \u201cthat relies heavily\u201d on the argument made by Abbe Gluck, a professor at Yale Law School.\nChief Justice John Roberts ASSOCIATED PRESSAs we wait for the Supreme Court to render its decision in the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act, we asked a panel of experts for their predictions.\nBut he expects that Chief Justice John Roberts will write the majority opinion, as he did in the Supreme Court\u2019s first ruling on the Affordable Care Act, in 2012."}
