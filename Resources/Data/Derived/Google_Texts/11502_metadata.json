But three Senate Republicans are threatening to defeat the new legislation.\n\nAs LifeNews.com has reported, Congressional Republicans are looking to use the reconciliation process to approve legislation to de-fund the Planned Parenthood abortion business, which has been caught selling aborted babies and their body parts. After the House approved the de-funding measure, Senate Democrats defeated a bill to fund the federal government that included language de-funding Planned Parenthood for one year while the Congressional investigation continues into how it allegedly violated multiple laws to sell aborted babies and their body parts.\n\nSIGN THE PETITION! Congress Must De-Fund Planned Parenthood Immediately\n\nNow, House Republican leaders are planning to target Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding by immediately drafting a fast-track reconciliation bill that would be able to overcome the Democrats\u2019 filibuster and be approved on a majority vote in the Senate.\n\nBut, as The Hill reports, three pro-abortion Republicans in the Senate are threatening to oppose the bill and their vote vote could derail the de-funding bill. Senate Republicans can only afford to lose three votes and still pass the Planned Parenthood de-funding bill with 51 votes, assuming every Senate Democrat votes against funding.\n\nSen. Mark Kirk (Ill.), one of the most vulnerable Republicans in next year\u2019s elections, twice voted against procedural motions on legislation to block the\n\nhealthcare group\u2019s funding. Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) has spoken on the Senate floor against defunding the group, though she did back a procedural motion in August that could have led to an up-or-down vote on defunding. She said she only did so on assurances from leadership that it would lead to another measure to maintain funding for Planned Parenthood\u2019s other healthcare services. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) has also backed funding for Planned Parenthood, though she made the same vote in August as Collins based on the same argument. \u201cWe\u2019re not making news today,\u201d said Kirk. \u201cI have not supported the defunding [of Planned Parenthood]. I\u2019ve supported the repeal of ObamaCare. I\u2019ve got to look at it as a whole,\u201d said Murkowski, who faces reelection next year but is favored to win. \u201cI\u2019m not going to prejudge what\u2019s sent over by the House until I\u2019ve seen all the components,\u201d said Collins.\n\nA fourth Republican, pro-life Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, is noncommittal on whether she will support the reconciliation de-funding bill.\n\n\u201cI have to look at it,\u201d said Ayotte, who on Monday learned Democrats had recruited Gov. Maggie Hassan to challenge her next year. The Ayotte-Hassan race is expected to be one of the most hotly contested Senate races in the cycle.\n\nOne of the contentious reasons why the Republicans may not support the de-funding bill is because the reconciliation package may also have language in it repealing parts of Obamacare. That\u2019s something pro-life Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hopes will be included after the House passes it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take up reconciliation when it comes over from the House. And it\u2019s my hope and expectation that it would have in it as much of ObamaCare as we can repeal. And I hope that it will also include provisions to de-fund Planned Parenthood,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nBut if Obamacare repeal is included, the de-funding bill may also lose the vote of a Democrat who considers himself pro-life on abortion. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia says he will vote against the Planned Parenthood de-funding bill if Obamacare repeal is included.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit. Pure, unadulterated bullshit,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the reconciliation process would result in getting a bill to de-fund Planned Parenthood to pro-abortion President Barack Obama\u2019s desk, Obama has already promised repeatedly to veto any bill that revokes taxpayer funding for the abortion company. The Senate does not have enough votes to overcome such a veto, leading some pro-life groups to point out that there is little hope of de-funding Planned Parenthood until the election of a pro-life president next year.\n\n\u201cThe Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of the Senate amendment to H.J.Res. 61, making continuing appropriations for fiscal year (FY) 2016, and for other purposes, which contains highly objectionable provisions that advance a narrow ideological agenda,\u201d the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said before the vote. Eliminating federal funding to Planned Parenthood would \u201climit access\u201d to healthcare for women, men, families and \u201cdisproportionately\u201d affect low-income people, the OMB said.\n\nWeeks ago, a previous Senate vote on de-funding Planned Parenthood saw Senate Democrats filibuster and block legislation to revoke $550 million in taxpayer funding.\n\nA new Congressional report finds that de-funding the Planned Parenthood abortion business \u2014 even for one year \u2014 would save \u201cseveral thousand\u201d unborn babies from the nightmare of abortion. The report also finds de-funding Planned Parenthood would save the federal government $235 million.\n\nThe 10th video by The Center for Medical Progress features several top-level Planned Parenthood executives discussing the organization\u2019s secretive practices around aborted fetal parts harvesting. The video includes comments from Deborah VanDerhei, the National Director of the organization\u2019s Consortium of Abortion Providers, describing the harvesting of fetal body parts as \u201cdonation for remuneration.\u201d\n\nThe expose\u2019 videos catching Planned Parenthood officials selling the body parts of aborted babies have shocked the nation. Here is a list of all ten:\n\nIn the first video : Dr. Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood commented on baby-crushing: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I\u2019m not gonna crush that part, I\u2019m gonna basically crush below, I\u2019m gonna crush above, and I\u2019m gonna see if I can get it all intact.\u201d\n\n: Dr. Deborah Nucatola of Planned Parenthood commented on baby-crushing: \u201cWe\u2019ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I\u2019m not gonna crush that part, I\u2019m gonna basically crush below, I\u2019m gonna crush above, and I\u2019m gonna see if I can get it all intact.\u201d In the second video: Planned Parenthood\u2019s Dr. Mary Gatter joked, \u201cI want a Lamborghini\u201d as she negotiated the best price for baby parts.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s Dr. Mary Gatter joked, \u201cI want a Lamborghini\u201d as she negotiated the best price for baby parts.
