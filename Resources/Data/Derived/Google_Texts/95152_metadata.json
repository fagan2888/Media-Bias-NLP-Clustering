Still, Biden -- who famously called the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act a \u201cbig f**king deal,\u201d said that the new marketplaces are nevertheless off to \u201chell of a start.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe may not get to seven million, we may get to five or six, but that\u2019s a hell of a start,\u201d Biden said while visiting a coffee shop in Minneapolis, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports. \u201cI\u2019m here to say thanks.\u201d\n\nBiden was in Minneapolis for a private Democratic National Committee fundraiser but stopped at Moose & Sadie\u2019s coffee shop specifically to talk about the Affordable Care Act. He met with four women who were invited there to talk about the law, the Star-Tribune reported.\n\nThe Obama administration initially said it wanted to enroll seven million Americans in the new marketplaces by the end of the six-month open enrollment period, aligning its goals with nonpartisan projections about the marketplace\u2019s popularity. Yet when the marketplaces opened for enrollment in October, the significant technical problems with HealthCare.gov and some state-based Obamacare websites seriously slowed down the process.\n\nLast week, the administration reported that nearly 3.3 million people have selected marketplace plans as of Feb. 1. Health and Human Services officials have said they are satisfied with the pace of enrollment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vice president says that in spite of setbacks, new insurance marketplaces are off to \u201chell of a start\u201d", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-we-may-not-meet-obamacare-marketplace-goals/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/02/20/83ab2eed-a0ea-45b6-8017-95d919e9dce8/thumbnail/1200x630/716be2e4df12b9212fe1e99f8e6ef95a/ap631923484357.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Vice president says that in spite of setbacks, new insurance marketplaces are off to \u201chell of a start\u201d", "title": "Biden: We may not meet Obamacare marketplace goals"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vice president says that in spite of setbacks, new insurance marketplaces are off to \u201chell of a start\u201d", "title": "Biden: We may not meet Obamacare marketplace goals", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/biden-we-may-not-meet-obamacare-marketplace-goals/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/biden-we-may-not-meet-obamacare-marketplace-goals/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-we-may-not-meet-obamacare-marketplace-goals/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "creator": "@http://twitter.com/stephcondoncbs", "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/02/20/83ab2eed-a0ea-45b6-8017-95d919e9dce8/thumbnail/1200x630/716be2e4df12b9212fe1e99f8e6ef95a/ap631923484357.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-we-may-not-meet-obamacare-marketplace-goals/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/biden-we-may-not-meet-obamacare-marketplace-goals/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/Political-Hotsheet/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f5f\"", "article_summary": "Vice President Joe Biden acknowledged Wednesday that the new Obamacare marketplaces may not meet their original enrollment goals.\nLast week, the administration reported that nearly 3.3 million people have selected marketplace plans as of Feb. 1.\nYet when the marketplaces opened for enrollment in October, the significant technical problems with HealthCare.gov and some state-based Obamacare websites seriously slowed down the process.\nThe Obama administration initially said it wanted to enroll seven million Americans in the new marketplaces by the end of the six-month open enrollment period, aligning its goals with nonpartisan projections about the marketplace\u2019s popularity.\nHe met with four women who were invited there to talk about the law, the Star-Tribune reported."}
