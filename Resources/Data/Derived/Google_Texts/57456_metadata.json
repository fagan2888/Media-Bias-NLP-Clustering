REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\n3911764\n\nWhile the media thoroughly covers the federal government shutdown, much less attention is paid to problems with the roll-out of the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare).\n\nThe media is paying a blind eye to the potential civil rights crisis it paves the way for.\n\nObamacare\u2019s glitches and long waits for would-be applicants are well-documented, but there\u2019s part of the rollout not catching the attention of many in the media.\n\nAs the Washington Examiner noted before the official enrollment even began, Obamacare applicants must provide some sort of identification verification. While that officially does not include a state-issued ID, it seems this exemption doesn\u2019t protect America\u2019s most vulnerable from having to jump through what have been described as far-reaching and insurmountable hoops.\n\nSocial Security cards, for example, are valid identification for Obamacare, but don\u2019t forget that getting one requires proof of identity and U.S. citizenship. Per the Social Security Administration\u2019s own website, one can only prove their identity with some form of state-issued identification.\n\nIt appears that, in order to receive Obamacare subsidies, enrollees may need state-issued identification.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic, then, that Attorney General Eric Holder recently sued the state of North Carolina over its new voter ID law. The state law allows prospective voters three years \u2014 until the 2016 elections \u2014 to obtain a valid ID to vote. Obamacare, available for enrollment as of October 1, begins punishing those without identification in just three months through its individual mandate.\n\nSeeing the hypocrisy here is unavoidable, but more important is what all this reveals about the voter ID debate.\n\nLiberals fight relentlessly to protect minorities \u2013 particularly African-Americans \u2013 from alleged barriers to voting. On the surface, this seems commendable. But, considering it is nearly impossible to participate in today\u2019s economy without valid identification, there is more to the ID issue than voting rights.\n\nIt is virtually impossible to open a checking account, travel by rail or air and apply for college or most jobs without proper identification. Subsidies offered through Obamacare are now also out of the reach to those lacking state-issued identification.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Hughey Newsome", "description": "Democrats were quick to challenge any voter ID law -- but Obamacare carries the same restrictions.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "While the media thoroughly covers the federal government shutdown, much less attention is paid to problems with the roll-out of the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare).
