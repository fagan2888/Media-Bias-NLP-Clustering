They interpreted it as a kind of highbrow millennial entitlement, exactly the kind projected by \u201cGirls\u201d characters Hannah, Shoshanna, Marnie, and Jessa, and picked apart by tiresome New York Times trend pieces. Gawker published decontextualized lines from Dunham\u2019s book proposal: \u201cI went to my first Women\u2019s Action Coalition meeting at age three\u201d; \u201cI\u2019ve been in therapy since I was seven\u201d; \u201cWhen I got to college I suddenly had the sense that my upbringing hadn\u2019t been very \u2018real.'\u201d In these snippets, Dunham comes across as a coddled, privileged and self-absorbed kid, enduring the same criticisms as her TV character. What can a memoir coming from that perspective offer a larger world of readers?\n\nA few things, it turns out. In an excerpt from her book, published in The New Yorker, Dunham writes candidly about her struggles with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Since childhood, she has endured hundreds of distracting and disturbing thoughts every day. As usual, she manages to poke fun at herself while writing about the disorder:\n\nThe first doctor, a violet-haired grandma-age woman with a German surname, asks me a few simple questions and then invites me to play with the toys scattered across her floor. She sits in a chair above me, pad in hand. I have the sense she will gather all kinds of information from this, so I put on a show that I\u2019m sure will demonstrate my loneliness and introspection: bootleg Barbie crashes her convertible with off-brand Ken riding shotgun. Tiny Lego men are killed in a war against their own kind. After a long period of observation, she asks me to share my three greatest wishes. \u201cA river, where I can be alone,\u201d I tell her, impressed with my poeticism. From this answer, she will know that I am not like other nine-year-olds.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The magazine just published an excerpt of Dunham's upcoming memoir, \"Not That Kind of Girl\"", "author": "Prachi Gupta", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The magazine just published an excerpt of Dunham's upcoming memoir, \"Not That Kind of Girl\"", "title": "New Yorker piece proves therapists are the perfect subject for Lena Dunham", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/25/new_yorker_piece_proves_therapists_are_the_perfect_subject_for_lena_dunham/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/lena_dunham3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The magazine just published an excerpt of Dunham's upcoming memoir, \"Not That Kind of Girl\"", "creator": "@prachigu", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/lena_dunham3.jpg", "title": "New Yorker piece proves therapists are the perfect subject for Lena Dunham", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "New Yorker piece proves therapists are the perfect subject for Lena Dunham", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Girls, hannah horvath, Lena Dunham, New Yorker, not that kind of girl, ocd, therapy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c4e\"", "article_summary": "In an excerpt from her book, published in The New Yorker, Dunham writes candidly about her struggles with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.\n'\u201d In these snippets, Dunham comes across as a coddled, privileged and self-absorbed kid, enduring the same criticisms as her TV character.\nTopics: Books, Girls, hannah horvath, Lena Dunham, New Yorker, not that kind of girl, ocd, therapy, Entertainment NewsWhen Lena Dunham first announced her memoir, \u201cNot That Kind of Girl,\u201d bloggers balked at the prospect of a 20-something writing a book that promised \u201cfrank and funny advice\u201d \u2014 especially one netting nearly 4 million dollars.\nWhat can a memoir coming from that perspective offer a larger world of readers?\n\u201cA river, where I can be alone,\u201d I tell her, impressed with my poeticism."}
