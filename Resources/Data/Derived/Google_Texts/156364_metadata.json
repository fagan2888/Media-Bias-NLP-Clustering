Denver and Maryland were squaring off in Philadelphia. The throng of DU alumni and students were watching the clock.\n\nMatt Brown was on duty behind the bar and a customer asked if it wasn\u2019t already 11 a.m. What was appearing on the television screen had nothing to do with lacrosse.\n\nBrown had the answer. With the restlessness increasing, he started his countdown.\n\n\u201cFive, four, three, two, one,\u201d and sure enough when he said \u201cone\u201d the playing field in Philadelphia came on the screen. Game on.\n\nAnd, from the outset, DU was in control, cruising to a 10-5 victory which helped make for a joyous watch party.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to have DU in the championship game,\u201d said Toby Gerard from a seat at the end of the downstairs bar. Gerard, A DU graduate in 2011, had more than a casual interest.\n\n\u201cI coach lacrosse at Evergreen High School,\u201d Gerard said. \u201cI\u2019m from New York and I played lacrosse all the way through high school, but I wasn\u2019t good enough to play at the Division I level when I got here.\u201d\n\nGeorgia Gerard, Toby\u2019s wife and also a DU alumnus, was ready pumped up for the game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an alumni and I like lacrosse,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to support a great team.\u201d\n\nThe Pioneers lived up to her expectations, scoring a quick goal, which resulted in a loud outburst from the DU partisans. Senior Wesley Berg kept the atmosphere lively, scoring three of Denver\u2019s first four goals as the Pioneers took an early 4-1 lead they did not relinquish.\n\nThe estimated crowd of 250-300 fans that jammed the main floor, the upstairs and the patio, were frequently on their feet to celebrate a goal.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re giving a great effort offensively,\u201d Toby Gerard said in the early going. \u201cThey\u2019ve had a lot of three-minute possessions waiting for the right shot.\u201d\n\nThe Pioneers were seeking their first NCAA lacrosse title and with three minutes left, the fans felt it safe to claim victory.\n\n\u201cDU had great goal tending and dominated throughout,\u201d Toby Gerard said. \u201cMaryland looked like garbage.\u201d\n\nThe celebration erupted when the game clock hit zero.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go Denver!\u201d the fans shouted.\n\nIrv Moss: 303-954-1296, imoss@denverpost.com or twitter.com/irvmoss", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver lacrosse joins in the celebration of national championship", "title": "Denver lacrosse joins in the celebration of national championship", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/25/denver-lacrosse-joins-in-the-celebration-of-national-championship/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150525__du-lacrossep1.jpg", "height": 461}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150525__du-lacrossep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-25T17:38:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T23:51:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Denver"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s really exciting to have DU in the championship game,\u201d said Toby Gerard from a seat at the end of the downstairs bar.\n\u201cThey\u2019re giving a great effort offensively,\u201d Toby Gerard said in the early going.\nWith the NCAA lacrosse championship at stake, the standing room only crowd in the Pioneer just off the University of Denver campus was eager for action Monday morning.\n\u201cDU had great goal tending and dominated throughout,\u201d Toby Gerard said.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go Denver!\u201d the fans shouted."}
