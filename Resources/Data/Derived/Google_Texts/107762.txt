SALT LAKE CITY — It used to be that outdoor enthusiasts went into the wilderness to unplug. Now, most want to stay plugged in to their electronic devices as long as they can.

As a result, companies are catering to hikers, bikers, skiers and paddle boarders by making an expanding number of products that protect smartphones from hard falls and water and keep electronic devices charged up for as many hours as possible.

One company has made a backpack with a built-in solar panel that charges a phone while a person hikes up the mountain. Another makes a portable battery that attaches to the widely-popular GoPro helmet camera and doubles how long it stays charged. A wide array of cases and devices that protect phones and tablets, including several that float.

“In order to enjoy the outdoors it used to be a just a nap sack and some freeze dried food,” said Walter Kaihatu of Brunton, a company that makes portable battery chargers. “Now, people are bringing $5,000 to $10,000 worth of equipment with them into the outdoors.”

The latest gadgets are on display this week in Salt Lake City at the world’s largest outdoor-gear trade show. The biannual expo brings 25,000 people to Utah to browse the latest gear and apparel from 1,300 vendors ranging from mega companies like Patagonia and Columbia to well as smaller, unknown businesses.
