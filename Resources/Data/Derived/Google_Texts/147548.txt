Shipping traffic through the Houston Ship Channel started to resume Tuesday, the Coast Guard said, as crews continued to try to remove oil from a weekend spill along the Texas coast.

Ships are being prioritized for passage through the channel, the Coast Guard said.

“The cleanup operations progress is to the point that there is minimal danger of contamination to the commercial maritime traffic and allowing limited transit during daylight hours,” said Capt. Brian Penoyer, commander of the Coast Guard for Houston-Galveston.

Almost 100 ships had been waiting to pass since 4,000 barrels of oil leaked into Galveston Bay on Saturday from a barge that collided with a ship.

More than 500 response workers were at the scene of the spill near Texas City on Monday to assist with the cleanup, officials said. Crews used tens of thousands of feet of containment boom to try to keep the oil away from the shore, but some oil washed up on local beaches.

Ferry service between Galveston and Port Bolivar had resumed, the Coast Guard said.

The spill has prompted concerns about the economic impact to one of the nation’s busiest ports and the environmental effects for wildlife. The shipping channel connects Houston’s oil refineries and other port facilities to the Gulf of Mexico.

The spill occurred near popular bird sanctuaries on Bolivar Peninsula during the spring migration season. On Monday night, the Coast Guard confirmed that at least 10 birds had died and several others were found covered in oil.

The barge was carrying almost one million gallons of bunker fuel oil, a particularly thick type of oil, but only one tank was breached, officials said. The barge has been removed, and the Coast Guard said it was investigating the cause of the collision.
