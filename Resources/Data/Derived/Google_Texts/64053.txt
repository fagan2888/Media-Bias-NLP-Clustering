Several motorcyclists riding in the “2 Million Bikers to D.C.” rally marking the anniversary of 9/11 were involved in an accident on the Capital Beltway, causing a traffic pileup, according to local media.

A firetruck was blocking two lanes and about 20 motorcycles were parked on the interstate around noon, WUSA-TV reported, causing traffic to back up.

In a separate incident, at least one biker apparently hit a rickshaw in the city, according to WUSA. Three people were reportedly sent to the hospital.
