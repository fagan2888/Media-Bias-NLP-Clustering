Calls are answered in an average of 16 minutes and can include getting a prescription, when appropriate, from a physician for a common ailment. Other benefits include advice from a nurse practitioner on how to ease pain, help from a billing expert with negotiating discounts to lower out-of-pocket costs, a referral from a vision professional on the right specialist, assistance from a health navigation expert on where to get an inexpensive MRI, and much more.\n\n\u201cEmployees constantly face tough choices, like calling off of work to take sick kids to the doctor, spending hours in crowded urgent care centers, and absorbing high fees towards high deductibles,\u201d explained Joe Stone, Executive Vice President for primeFORCE. \u201cWith primeFORCE Healthline, help is just a call away, round the clock, from home, easing fears of lost pay and postponed care.

On average, Americans visit a physician, hospital outpatient, or emergency department four times per year, at a cost of $104 per office visit and $1,318 per ER trip. \u201cIf employers can eliminate just of one of each per employee per year the savings on claims alone add up quickly,\u201d said Stone. With primeFORCE Healthline, employers experience an average of 3.6X annual ROI, resulting from reduced call-offs, higher productivity, lower turnover, and lower expenses on claims. \u201cHealthline is a pressure relief valve for busy families, and welcome relief for employers looking for creative ways to keep talent.
