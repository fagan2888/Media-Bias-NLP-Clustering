Or will it be a wash like 1998 and flatten into a mere ripple?\n\nIn 1994, we saw the Republican majority coming in a confidential survey that we did in September of that year for RNC chairman Haley Barbour and House Republican leadership member Bill McCollum. We were able to predict that, if the Republicans didn\u2019t compromise on Hillarycare, it would be what we called a \u201ctsunami.\u201d Never before had we seen a Republican lead on the generic ballot for Congress \u2014 let alone a seven-point lead. Never. But that was the Republican generic-ballot lead in our September 1994 national poll.\n\nPrior to this month it looked like this November would be similar to 1998. So far this year, our 2014 National Monthly McLaughlinOnline Poll has remained relatively constant. Since January a majority of likely voters gave the president a net negative overall job rating. However, the Democrats were able to maintain a plurality lead in the generic ballot for Congress \u2014 until this month.\n\nFrom January through April. Democrats held a slight, one- or two-point edge. Each month, one in six voters were undecided. Most of these undecided voters disapproved of the job the president is doing, but they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to say they\u2019d vote Republican for Congress. In fact, among those who disapproved of the job the president was doing, four in ten voters were actually saying they\u2019d vote Democratic for Congress.\n\nBut this month, they appear to be breaking for Republicans. Even though the decisive plurality of voters in our national polls is Democratic, Republicans now lead on the generic ballot for Congress, 43 percent to 41 percent. Not a great lead and a long way from a trend, but the gravity of the president\u2019s negative job rating, the parallel opposition to Obamacare, and the strong desire to put a check on the lame-duck president is beginning to create political momentum that could put Democrats under another tsunami.\n\nJust look at the monthly changes from April to May:\n\nIn April, the president had a net negative job approval, 47 percent to -52 (-5). In May it worsened by six points to 44\u201355 (-11).\n\nIn April, Obamacare had a net negative approval rating, 45\u201351 (-6). In May, it worsened by seven points, to 42\u201355 (-13). Obamacare remains the Democrats\u2019 millstone, and the VA scandal has given Americans a real-life look into the reality of government health-care rationing.\n\nIn April, 47 percent of voters preferred that their representative in Congress be a Republican who is a check on the president, versus 43 percent who preferred a Democrat who will help the president pass his agenda. In May, the Republican check and balance gained a net nine points, lifting it to a majority position, 51\u201338.\n\nFor the first time this year, our monthly generic ballot for Congress went Republican. In April it was 41 percent Republican to 43 percent Democratic 43. In May, it\u2019s now 43\u201341 in favor of the GOP.\n\nCan it get worse for the Democrats \u2014 a strong double-digit House gain for Republicans and a Republican Senate tsunami? A further analysis of the undecided vote says yes.\n\nOne in six voters, 16 percent, are still undecided for Congress, but those voters disapprove of the job the president is doing 30 percent to 67. They disapprove of Obamacare 29\u201362. They want a Republican congressman to be a check on President Obama 42 percent to 17.\n\nThe Republicans could take six in ten of these undecided voters and have a national majority vote for Congress of about 52 percent.\n\nWe wish the election were next week. November 4 is a long way away, and time allows Republicans to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. But the political pull of that fixed date is about to hit the Democrats like a meteor destined for its target.\n\nMaybe President Obama will change the election\u2019s course by placing a moratorium on Obamacare and starting over? Maybe he\u2019ll approve the Keystone pipeline and approve more drilling offshore and on federal lands? Maybe he\u2019ll compromise with Republicans to really secure the border and reduce illegal immigration by 90 percent? Maybe he\u2019ll really put a freeze on Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons? Or maybe the president will reinstate workfare for able-bodied adults to get welfare and food stamps?\n\nThere have to be a lot of Democratic pollsters and candidates seeing the same numbers and hoping for drastic policy changes from the White House.\n\nFive months to go.\n\n\u2014 John McLaughlin and Jim McLaughlin are Republican strategists and partners in the national polling firm McLaughlin & Associates.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "Is the Midterm Tsunami on Its Way?", "sailthru.author": "John McLaughlin, Jim McLaughlin", "description": "For months pundits have speculated about the potential for a six-year backlash against the incumbent president in this fall\u2019s midterms, similar to 2006 and 1986.
