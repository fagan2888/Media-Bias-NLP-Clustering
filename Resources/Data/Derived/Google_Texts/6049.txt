Ninety-four officers across Mississippi have been killed in the line of duty just this year, according to the official Officer Down Memorial Page. For the many families who have felt the pain of losing a loved one in law enforcement, the community is giving back in a unique way.

Officers and community members from all over the state came out to the Battlefield Shooting range for the first annual Mississippi Fallen Officers Memorial Three-Gun Match. The funds raised go toward the families of those officers who have paid the ultimate sacrifice.

"The families that are left behind are in chaos. They have a lot of expenses maybe from funerals and things that maybe insurance may not be paying," C.E.R.T. training officer Michael Street says. "We want to try to help those families. Right here, coming up on the holiday season, maybe help with Christmas for the children. Maybe pay a power bill. Just something to give back to those families. "

Eight teams and several individuals participate in these shooting competitions. Coordinators hope to continue growing this memorial in the future, and make a real difference for families who have selflessly given up a loved one for their community, city and state.
