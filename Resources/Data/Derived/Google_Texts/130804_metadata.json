And while she has maintained a strong advantage with women voters overall, she's not doing well with all women. White millennial women favor Bernie Sanders.\n\nPerhaps that's because the best rationale for Clinton's candidacy hasn't been effectively communicated to millennial women. There is a powerful case to be made for electing a woman president, and it has nothing to do with the straw man of identity politics.\n\nThe most compelling reason women should vote for Hillary Clinton? Pure self-interest.\n\n[A] model ... predicts that Democratic and Republican women will offer three times more feminist bills than their male counterparts will.\n\nThe global scholarship leaves no doubt: Women in political office make it a priority to advance rights, equality and opportunity for women and girls, in a way and to a degree that men in power overwhelmingly do not.\n\nA large body of research has been devoted to answering a fundamental question: Do women substantively represent women more effectively than men do? In hundreds of studies examining large data sets of roll call votes, bill sponsorship, laws enacted and other measures the answer is clear. \u201cAcross time, office, and political parties,\u201d political scientist Beth Reingold writes in a comprehensive review, \u201cwomen, more often than men, take the lead on women's issues, no matter how such issues are defined.\u201d\n\nConsider just a handful of these studies. Georgetown University's Michele Swers has found, among other things, that both Democratic and moderate Republican women in Congress have been more likely than men in either party to advance legislation on child care and domestic violence. Even when men and women in the same party hold similar opinions \u2014 on reproductive health issues, for example \u2014 it is the women officeholders who step up. This is particularly clear at the state level, where legislatures with more women have passed fewer abortion restrictions. Another study analyzed every instance in which a U.S. House seat switched between a woman and man between 1973 and 2002. Controlling for multiple factors, the model generated by that analysis predicts that Democratic and Republican women will offer three times more feminist bills than their male counterparts will.\n\nIt's much the same in other nations. An analysis of 31 countries (including the United States) found a statistically significant relationship: the higher the proportion of women lawmakers, the greater the number of laws enacted to advance gender equality. Jennifer Piscopo, an Occidental College political scientist, examined 18,700 bills introduced in Argentina's lower house over a 10-year period and found that nearly three-quarters of women's rights bills were written by women.\n\nSuch findings don't mean that all female officeholders seek to advance women's rights, or that women govern only from the standpoint of gender. But the research does speak strongly to the fact that women and men in power have different priorities.\n\nAnd then there's the danger that if women aren't at the table, they might be on the menu. In late 2009, the all-male Senate Democratic leadership team met privately to decide what would be included in the final Affordable Care Act. They eliminated a women's healthcare amendment that had passed overwhelmingly in committee, and that included coverage for such things as contraceptives and mammograms. The amendment's sponsor, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), had to demand its reinstatement just as the caucus was about to vote on the final bill.\n\n\u201cYou have to include the women,\u201d she told then-majority leader Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.). Had she not stood her ground, with the support of other women senators, the interests of 51% of the population would have been sacrificed in the most consequential piece of legislation in a generation.\n\nThe scholarship, and anecdotal evidence like Mikulski's story, argues that women should take their distinctive interests and concerns as women into account when they decide how to vote. But we don't often hear about the interest-based case for electing women.\n\nCertainly part of the explanation is that women voters care about many issues, not just \u201cwomen's issues.\u201d Still, their aversion to explicitly advocating for themselves, I suspect, stems from fear of being labeled selfish. From childhood, women imbibe the notion that selfishness, like ambition, make them unlikable and untrustworthy. This may be part of how we get to a moment in which white working-class men's overwhelming support for Trump or Sanders is called a \u201cmovement,\u201d while women's support for Clinton is dismissed as touchy-feely \u201cidentity politics.\u201d\n\nThe U. S. has made tremendous advances on equal rights over the last 40 years, and yet we have a ways to go. Women are paid less than men in almost every job and at every level. Ours is the only advanced economy that doesn't guarantee paid leave for new mothers. On broad measures of gender equality, the United States ranks an unimpressive 28th in the world.\n\nTo achieve equal opportunity and full participation for women and girls in all areas of American life demands leadership, dedication and political will \u2014 and especially the will to expend political capital \u2014 at the top.\n\nAll the evidence tells us that our odds of making progress on gender equality will be much higher if the president is a woman.\n\nNancy L.
