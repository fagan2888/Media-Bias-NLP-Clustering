Dan Pfeiffer, a top Obama strategist, told The New York Times that even within the West Wing there were debates about how unconventional the president could be in trying to promote his message to young people. Staffers joked that some of the more outrageous gambits \u201cwere going to give David Gergen a heart attack.\u201d Gergen, a longtime D.C. insider who has advised presidents of both parties, most recently Bill Clinton, hasn\u2019t gone into cardiac arrest, but he did confirm that he\u2019s \u201cno fan of presidents appearing on shows\u201d like Galifianakis\u2019s. Mike McCurry, who spent four years as Clinton\u2019s press spokesman, likewise cautioned that Obama should \u201cworry about the dignity of the presidency.\u201d\n\nYou know things are bad when even former Clinton loyalists think Obama is demeaning his office.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe president went on Funny or Die to plug the Affordable Care Act and urge young adults to enroll at HealthCare.gov. Administration officials wasted no time declaring the show a success. Within hours after being posted, more than 9 million people had viewed it, and ObamaCare spokeswoman Tara McGuinness tweeted that it had become \u201cthe #1 source of referrals to HealthCare.gov,\u201d more than 32,000 before the end of the day.\n\nMission accomplished? Maybe so, but at the price of being mocked in a faux interview by an entertainer whose shtick involves insulting his guest with boorish questions. Where will Obama build his presidential library, Galifianakis asked, \u201cin Hawaii or your home country of Kenya?\u201d If Obama had a son, would he be interested in football or be \u201ca nerd like you?\u201d Affecting utter boredom as the president made a plug for ObamaCare, he sighed: \u201cIs this what they mean by drones?\u201d\n\nThere was a time when presidents understood that their position demanded a certain gravity. That the nation\u2019s chief executive was not just another celebrity, but the custodian of unique constitutional authority. That when you live in the White House and fly on Air Force One and everyone stands when you enter the room, it isn\u2019t appropriate for you to pander to the lowest cultural denominator.\n\nExactly where the line should be drawn has always been something of an open question. \u201cI think the American public wants a solemn ass as a president, and I think I\u2019ll go along with them,\u201d Calvin Coolidge once said. Yet he didn\u2019t balk at donning a feathered Sioux headdress during a trip to South Dakota in 1927, overruling advisers who feared he would appear laughable. Replied Coolidge: \u201cWell, it\u2019s good for people to laugh, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nIn truth, most Americans don\u2019t want their presidents to be solemn asses. But they are expected to \u201cmaintain the dignity of office,\u201d as George Washington told James Madison, while simultaneously avoiding the \u201cimputation of superciliousness or unnecessary reserve.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a balancing act, and as public mores evolve, so do notions of presidential propriety. For a long time presidents were especially careful to respect the \u201cdignity of office.\u201d Their more recent successors take greater pains not to be accused of \u201cunnecessary reserve.\u201d Harry Truman wore a coat and tie when he took his \u201cdaily constitutional.\u201d Bill Clinton and both George Bushes saw nothing wrong with publicly jogging in shorts and sweaty T-shirts.\n\nBut even in our anything-goes era, there ought to be limits. When Clinton, on MTV in 1994, was asked if he wears \u201cboxers or briefs,\u201d he should have responded with an icy stare, and turned to another questioner. Instead, grinning, he revealed his underwear preference.\n\nThat crossed a line that should have been inviolable, degrading not only Clinton but the respect owed to the presidency. Fourteen years later, when the same question was posed to candidate Obama, he knew better than to dignify it with a substantive response. \u201cI don\u2019t answer those humiliating questions,\u201d he replied.\n\nHe should have said exactly the same thing when he was asked to go on Galifianakis\u2019s insult-slinging interview show. It may have been a hip, edgy way to drive traffic to the Obamacare exchange. But it also diminished the president and the nation he represents. There are better ways to get hits on a website.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "3.2.3022339709", "eomportal-id": 1074641, "description": "A witless and undignified stunt?
