Across Texas, community mental health centers face the reality of unmet needs each day as people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, serious mental illness and substance use disorders seek help.\n\nThe 39 organizations that comprise the Texas Council of Community Centers don\u2019t want to lose any more time when so many lives are at risk. And maybe we won\u2019t have to.\n\nLast month, Texas was awarded a one-year planning grant from the Excellence in Mental Health Act Medicaid Demonstration Program, better known as the Excellence Act. We were selected along with 23 other states to share a $22.9 million allocation from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nMembers of the Texas Council of Community Centers are already making a big difference as a result of bipartisan support for investments in mental health services. We welcome this grant as a rare opportunity to advance our goals of providing well coordinated, effective, integrated care for mental health and substance use disorders that frequently co-occur with other chronic health conditions.\n\nInitial funds will be used to develop system transformations that prepare us to apply for a two-year pilot program. The two-year pilot phase will increase access to well coordinated, integrated services while improving Medicaid reimbursement for the eight states that will ultimately selected for the demonstration program.\n\nThat\u2019s right, just eight states \u2014 out of the 24 that should have the ability to expand and improve behavioral health care delivery.\n\nThe lack of ready access to treatment results in nearly insurmountable problems when our emergency rooms, nursing homes, homeless shelters and prisons take on the unassigned role of \u201cmental health provider\u201d in addition to their primary responsibilities. The costs alone speak for themselves: According to a 2011 report commissioned by the Texas Conference of Urban Counties, in jail, behavioral treatment costs $137 per day per patient; in the emergency room, it's $986 per day \u2014 until the patient is discharged, often to start the entire cycle over again.\n\nIn one of our community centers, that daily cost is just $12.\n\nPrisons, most importantly, shouldn\u2019t be treatment centers, as we understand very well here in Texas. Community mental health centers have the invaluable support of law enforcement across the state. Officials like Limestone County Sheriff Dennis Wilson, who currently chairs our board of directors, recognize that expansion of the Excellence Act would ensure Texas\u2019 ability to help lay an even stronger financial foundation for our communities.\n\nDespite historically low funding for mental health services compared to other states, Texas is emerging as a recognized and innovative leader in this field of health care delivery. During the recession of December 2007-June 2009, when other states cut funding for mental health and other critical services, Texas continued to invest. As the recession \u201ccaught up with us\u201d in 2011, we experienced a few incremental delays in funding but in 2013 began investing again as the economy rebounded.\n\nOur forward-thinking legislators know that if you don\u2019t fund early intervention in behavioral health treatment, you\u2019ll pay for it in the criminal justice system. This past session, our Legislature appropriated funds to expand inpatient and outpatient mental health treatment as well as crisis response alternatives to expensive hospitalization, recognizing that people with mental illness and substance use disorders should have access to the right treatment at the right time.\n\nTexas was the first state in the nation to pass legislation and appropriate funds for training instructors and educators in Mental Health First Aid\u00ae. Much like arming the public with CPR training, the law has allowed our member centers to provide mental health instruction for more than 14,000 educators and the general public.\n\nWe are ready to collaborate and shape the future of behavioral health in Texas. Congress, please expand the Excellence Act so our community mental health centers can do more of what they do best. So many depend on us \u2014 and now, they also depend on you.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.tribtalk.org/2015/12/03/congress-must-expand-the-excellence-in-mental-health-act/", "image": "https://cdn.tribtalk.org/media/photos/2015/12/Mental-Illness.jpg", "site_name": "TribTalk", "description": "A lack of ready access to mental health treatment results in nearly insurmountable problems when our emergency rooms, nursing homes, homeless shelters and prisons take on that role in addition to their primary responsibilities.&nbsp;", "title": "Congress must expand the Excellence in Mental Health Act, by Danette Castle"}, "fb": {"app_id": 703403706393563}, "description": "The Texas Tribune's opinion site", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Congress, please expand the Excellence Act so our community mental health centers can do more of what they do best.\nLast month, Texas was awarded a one-year planning grant from the Excellence in Mental Health Act Medicaid Demonstration Program, better known as the Excellence Act.\nCommunity mental health centers have the invaluable support of law enforcement across the state.\nAcross Texas, community mental health centers face the reality of unmet needs each day as people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, serious mental illness and substance use disorders seek help.\nDespite historically low funding for mental health services compared to other states, Texas is emerging as a recognized and innovative leader in this field of health care delivery."}
