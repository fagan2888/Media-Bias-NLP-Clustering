Not on Capitol Hill, at least not just yet, according to POLITICO\u2019s Burgess Everett: \u201cMike Rounds got the call from Marco Rubio\u2019s campaign within hours of his big third-place finish in Iowa: Would the South Dakota senator consider an endorsement now that Rounds\u2019 pick, Mike Huckabee, dropped out? \u2018I told [the Rubio surrogate], \u2018We\u2019ll be happy to visit with you. \u2026 But Rounds wasn\u2019t ready to commit; he wanted to speak to Huckabee first. Ditto for Arkansas Sen. John Boozman, another Huckabee backer on Capitol Hill.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n--\"After the Senate GOP\u2019s persona non grata, Ted Cruz, notched a commanding win in Iowa, there was growing sentiment Tuesday among Republican senators \u2014 a bellwether of the GOP establishment \u2014 that they need to coalesce behind a single candidate in the nominating contest to beat back Cruz and Donald Trump. But if Rubio was hoping for a stampede to his corner following South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott\u2019s key endorsement, it did not materialize on Tuesday \u2026 The reluctance means that Republicans who\u2019ve been clamoring for a consensus candidate to take on Cruz or Donald Trump will have to wait a little longer \u2014 probably at least until after New Hampshire, where Rubio needs to elbow aside the likes of Chris Christie, Bush and Kasich to maintain his momentum.\u201d http://goo.gl/2cycyF\n\n--But some are starting to get persuaded. National Journal\u2019s Daniel Newhauser and Alex Rogers report that some Bush backers on Capitol Hill, like Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), are rethinking their support and leaning toward Rubio. Sessions tells the pair: \u201cI\u2019m for endorsing Jeb Bush. But that was 10 months ago. He has since then not sold himself as well as he had wanted.\u201d http://goo.gl/2Uj90l\n\n@burgessev: Hatch says Bush didn't disappoint last night because no one expected him to do that well.\n\n--WaPo\u2019s Paul Kane goes inside Sen. Tim Scott\u2019s thought process as the South Carolina Republican decided to endorse Rubio for president: https://goo.gl/HWio06\n\nFLINT HEARING PREVIEW: KEY LAPSES BY MICHIGAN OFFICIALS \u2013 The AP\u2019s Matthew Daly has the advance copy of testimony from top officials responding to the Flint water crisis: \u201cMichigan should have required the city of Flint to treat its water for corrosion-causing elements after elevated lead levels were first discovered in the city's water a year ago, the state's top environmental regulator says in congressional testimony. State officials 'relied on technical compliance (with the law) instead of assuring safe drinking water,' says Keith Creagh, director of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality.\"\n\n--\u201cHe calls that a mistake. But state officials are not the only ones who made mistakes in Flint, Creagh says. All levels of government deserve blame in the Flint crisis, he says.\u201d http://goo.gl/4x1vg5\n\n--Hearing begins at 9 a.m. in 2154 Rayburn. Over in the Senate, disagreements over how to handle the Flint crisis in connection with an energy bill remain, per Morning Consult: http://goo.gl/t3OTGy\n\nKOCHS PUSH ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM \u2013 BuzzFeed News\u2019 Tarini Parti from Indian Wells, Calif.: \u201cThe momentum for criminal justice legislation is slowing down on Capitol Hill, but hundreds of miles away, Charles Koch \u2014 one of its biggest supporters \u2014 continued to aggressively make the case for it to pass this year, even as the billionaire becomes the face of one of the sticking points. \u2018The issue we\u2019ve been working hard on is criminal justice reform, so if somebody makes one mistake, non-violent, it starts with this question: Do you have right to run your own life as long as you don\u2019t violate the rights of others and you\u2019re not bothering anybody?\u2019 Koch said to donors on Sunday at the winter meeting of the political network affiliated with the industrialist brothers, which drew about 500 attendees.\u201d http://goo.gl/wyK56e\n\nHAPPY WEDNESDAY, Feb. 03, 2016 where we appreciate the strong selfie action from Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) in this CQ Roll Call photo: http://goo.gl/P3G54A. I\u2019m taking over for the rest of the week, and I\u2019m always at skim@politico.com and on Twitter at @seungminkim.\n\nMy new followers include @apwillweissert and @anismuslimin.\n\nTODAY IN CONGRESS \u2013 The House is in at 10 a.m. with votes around 1:15 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. and then again between 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. Votes are scheduled for the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act. The Senate is in at 9:30 a.m. and will continue working on the Energy Policy Modernization Act.\n\nAROUND THE HILL \u2013 Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and a whole bunch of Senate Democrats will hold a forum on student debt at 9 a.m. in S-207. House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-Pa.) and other committee members will hold a news conference on the FAA reauthorization at 11:30 a.m. in HVC Studio A. Reps. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.), Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and others will hold a news conference following the Oversight Committee hearing on the Flint water crisis at 2 p.m. in HVC Studio A.\n\nJust off the Hill, Heritage Action is hosting its third annual conservative policy summit featuring more than 20 lawmakers from Capitol Hill. The all-day event begins at 9 a.m. and will be held at the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Allison Auditorium, 214 Massachusetts Ave. NE. Speaker Paul Ryan is speaking at 9:10 a.m.; you can RSVP here: http://goo.gl/9KNycQ. Preview of Ryan\u2019s remarks here: https://goo.gl/lI9M58\n\nAnd Hill conservatives, led by Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), will launch the Article I Project at 8 a.m. at Hillsdale College\u2019s Kirby Center, 227 Massachusetts Ave NE. Lee and Hensarling have an op-ed in National Review previewing their efforts here: http://goo.gl/TVMz1A\n\nCONGRATULATIONS \u2026 to the members of the Senate Press Secretaries Association\u2019s 2016-17 executive board: President Ryan Taylor (Sen. Roger Wicker), Ashton Davies (Sen. Lamar Alexander), J.P. Freire (Sen. Orrin Hatch), Julia Krieger (Sen. Heidi Heitkamp), Katie Niederee (Sen. Jerry Moran), Neal Patel (Sen. Dean Heller), Rebecca Steele (Sen. Ron Wyden) and Megan Whittemore (Sen. David Perdue).\n\nTHE OBAMA-RYAN KABUKI SUMMIT \u2013 POLITICO\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere and Jake Sherman have the analysis: \u201cAt the White House on Tuesday, President Barack Obama resumed his own 2016 campaigning. Hosting Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) for their first meeting with GOP leaders in months \u2014 and the first formal meeting since Ryan took over the speakership in October \u2014 Obama and his aides spent a lot of time publicly talking about passing a legislative agenda, followed immediately and inevitably by complaining about Republicans obstructing that legislative agenda. In reality, the White House seemed most interested in the latter.\u201d http://goo.gl/y88GM2\n\n--The Obama administration is asking Congress for $1.1 billion in additional funding to battle opioid abuse \u2013 one of the issues raised during Obama\u2019s meeting with Ryan and McConnell on Tuesday. Gardiner Harris for the New York Times: http://goo.gl/YeJhvE. And a quick rundown of other topics discussed, via Burgess and yours truly: http://goo.gl/fgdumG\n\n--Ryan held a \u201cbudget and beer\u201d get-together on Tuesday night to talk budget, which seems to have turned into a lively discussion: @MEPFuller -- 10:07 p.m. | Speaker Paul Ryan is *still* meeting with House Freedom Caucus members about the budget.\n\nJUST ONE MORE OBAMACARE VOTE \u2013 Quite appropriately on Groundhog Day, House Republicans took one more whack at the health care law by trying to override Obama\u2019s veto of a bill to dismantle Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood. Take it away, USA Today: \u201cThe 241-186 vote to override the veto fell short of the two-thirds needed, ensuring that the Affordable Care Act will remain in place at least through the final year of Obama's term \u2026 Republican House leaders knew that they would lose the Obamacare vote, but they are hoping to use the issue to convince voters to elect a GOP president to help them overturn the 2010 heath care law in the next Congress.\u201d http://goo.gl/GO0CV0\n\nTHE VITTER AMENDMENT IS (SORT OF) BACK! Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) isn\u2019t letting his lame-duck status allow him to go out quietly \u2013 at least when it comes to Obamacare. CQ Roll Call\u2019s Niels Lesniewski reports: \u201cSen. David Vitter, R-La., is threatening to stall the Office of Personnel Management director\u2019s nomination from moving forward unless he receives information on congressional enrollment under the Affordable Care Act. In a Tuesday letter to OPM\u2019s acting director Beth F. Cobert, who is set to appear at a nomination hearing this week, Vitter asked that Cobert answer a series of questions and disclose correspondence relating to an OPM rule that allowed lawmakers and their staff to enroll in the District of Columbia\u2019s small business health insurance exchange.\u201d http://goo.gl/y7RLUz\n\nCHAKA FATTAH, JR. SENTENCED \u2013 From Julie Shaw of the Philadelphia Daily News: \u201cBefore being sentenced Tuesday to five years in prison and ordered to pay more than $1 million restitution to the clients and banks he defrauded, Chaka \u2018Chip\u2019 Fattah Jr. told the court that the government had gotten it wrong. That argument clearly went nowhere. U.S. District Judge Harvey Bartle III ordered that the congressman's son be immediately taken into custody. He was hauled away while his father, U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah (D., Pa.), his mother, and a sister sat in the gallery.\u201d http://goo.gl/0OlUaM\n\nTUESDAY\u2019S TRIVIA WINNER \u2013 No one answered correctly, so I\u2019m trying again.\n\nTODAY\u2019S TRIVIA \u2013 Today\u2019s question via Shelby Boxenbaum: In November, Jenean Hampton made history when she became the first black statewide officeholder in Kentucky. In 1924, Emma Guy Cromwell became the first woman to win statewide election in Kentucky. But who was the first woman to run statewide in Kentucky? What year? And what position? The first person to correctly answer gets a mention in the next day\u2019s Huddle. E-mail skim@politico.com.\n\nGET HUDDLE emailed to your Blackberry, iPhone or other mobile device each morning.

This method is used to determine book income and tax liability.\n\nUnder some tax reform proposals, family-owned American wine and spirits wholesalers would be forced to pay massive retroactive taxes on their LIFO reserves. This tax on family businesses would result in a tax increase equivalent to $2,642 for every one of the industry\u2019s 65,000 employees.\n\nLIFO repeal results in higher future tax bills that are particularly burdensome for family companies and threatens wine and spirits wholesalers\u2019 ability to invest in new inventory, employees, training, equipment and technology.\n\nWSWA opposes the repeal of LIFO. http://www.wswa.org/facts-data **", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "title": "REPUBLICANS RUSHING TO RUBIO? \u2013 How Tim Scott chose Rubio \u2013 FLINT HEARING TODAY ON HILL \u2013 Kochs push on criminal justice reform \u2013 THE OBAMA-RYAN KABUKI SUMMIT \u2013 Vitter\u2019s Obamacare crusade returns", "url": "http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/huddle/2016/02/politico-huddle-republicans-rushing-to-rubio-how-tim-scott-chose-rubio-flint-hearing-today-on-hill-kochs-push-on-criminal-justice-reform-the-obama-ryan-kabuki-summit-vitters-obamacare-crusade-returns-212500", "image": "http://static.politico.com/97/de/e15842c94e928ce8b561e20745a0/whitelogoondots.jpeg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u2013 How Tim Scott chose Rubio \u2013 FLINT HEARING TODAY ON HILL \u2013 Kochs push on criminal justice reform \u2013 THE OBAMA-RYAN KABUKI SUMMIT \u2013 Vitter\u2019s Obamacare crusade returnsBy Seung Min Kim (skim@politico.com or @seungminkim)REPUBLICANS RUSHING TO RUBIO?\nand others will hold a news conference following the Oversight Committee hearing on the Flint water crisis at 2 p.m. in HVC Studio A.\nAROUND THE HILL \u2013 Sen.
