Federal law already mandates that these companies keep track of that data; the new regulation would allow the public to see the numbers and the companies (but not the victim IDs) which in turn would lead businesses to work even harder at being safe.\n\nThe idea fits in with the less-is-more type of regulation President Obama has extolled. \u201cWe are seeking more affordable, less intrusive means to achieve the same ends \u2014 giving careful consideration to benefits and costs,\u201d he wrote in a 2011 op-ed. \u201cThis means writing rules with more input from experts, businesses, and ordinary citizens. It means using disclosure as a tool to inform consumers of their choices, rather than restricting those choices.\u201d\n\nPerhaps predictably, some employer lobbies oppose the rule, although the only cost identified by OSHA is staff time emailing existing data to the agency once a year (or quarterly for places with 250 or more workers). \u201cPublicly disclosing specifically injury and illness data serves little public good,\u201d Amanda Wood of the National Association of Manufacturers told NPR. \u201cIt\u2019s easily misinterpreted and can lead to unfair conclusions or judgments about a company or particular industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe injury and illness data that is to be made public by the proposed rule won\u2019t include information that explains how the injury occurred.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s kind of a standard response when a business, or a government, for that matter, is asked for greater disclosure: The public\u2019s too dumb to understand what they\u2019re seeing. It\u2019s not just businesses making this case, nor do they necessarily see their argument in the damning light I\u2019ve used \u2014 the editors of Scientific American, I\u2019d argue as an example, probably have a fairly generous view of their readership.\n\n\u201cThe injury and illness data that is to be made public by the proposed rule won\u2019t include information that explains how the injury occurred, such as whether an employee acted in an unsafe manner or failed to follow the employer\u2019s safety rules,\u201d explains attorney Michael J. Moberg at Lexology, the website for corporate counsels. \u201cThe incomplete information OSHA intends to make public may allow competitors, plaintiff\u2019s lawyers, unions, and others to distort this information and wrongly label employers as unsafe or as \u2018bad actors.\u2019\u201d Seems like a case for fuller disclosure, then, not less\u2026.\n\n(Moberg also points to the Obamacare computer debacle, and hints that government itself might not be competent to handle posting this potentially sensitive information.)\n\nThen again, opposition may fall more along the Howard Beale model \u2014 businesses are fed up with regulation, even cheap and easy ones. As one new paper on the regulatory burden of workplace safety rules notes, \u201cIn 2011 USA businesses were required to comply with 165,000 pages of regulations, covering all areas, not just safety.\u201d (If it\u2019s any consolation, many Western democracies are in the same boat, authors Andrew Hale, David Borys, and Mark Adams write in the journal Safety Science, although some are bailing out the flood of silly rules faster than others.)\n\nWhile they were looking mostly at more onerous workplace rules and not at disclosure, Hale and company touch on one of the benefits that public shaming has over imposed rules: \u201cIf external rules are phrased as goals, outcomes, or risk-management process rules, the task of translation and adaptation remains inside the company and can still power the motor of rule management.\u201d In short, companies know how to manage companies better than the government knows how to manage companies.\n\nGiven these concerns, you might think workplace injuries were becoming more of a problem to he covered up than a success story to be trumpeted. Liability costs aside \u2014 and that\u2019s a legitimate concern \u2014 workplace injuries in the U.S. actually are falling and have been for some time.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, last year three million American were hurt or sickened on the job. The figure, which only covers private industry, comes down to 3.4 cases per 100 full-time workers. (Being more than full-time, by the way, is a recipe for getting hurt.) Says BLS, \u201cThe rate reported for 2012 continues the pattern of statistically significant declines that, with the exception of 2011, occurred annually for the last decade.\u201d Fatalities, which include homicides and road accidents, were down again in 2012 (to 4,383). That\u2019s the second lowest total in the two decades that those records were compiled \u2014 and keep in mind that\u2019s set against a growing workforce.\n\nAlthough, as Dr. David Michaels, the assistant secretary of labor for workplace safety said, \u201cThree million injuries are three million too many,\u201d on the whole this is a good news story.
