So is choosing the right dental coverage.\n\nWhile dental insurance doesn\u2019t command the attention that medical insurance does, it also can have significant implications for your pocketbook.\n\nYou know exactly what I mean if you have the most common type of health insurance (more on that later) and have ever needed a procedure such as a crown or root canal.\n\nRead: $$$$\n\nMore than 19 million Californians had commercial dental insurance in 2014, and most of them obtained it through their employers, according to the National Association of Dental Plans (NADP).\n\nBut \u201cin a way, it shouldn\u2019t even be called insurance,\u201d says Jeff Album, a vice president at Delta Dental, California\u2019s largest dental insurer.\n\nAlbum prefers calling it \u201ca prepaid plan\u201d for preventive and basic services, such as cleanings and fillings.\n\nIf you need a more complicated procedure, \u201cyou\u2019re going to end up paying a big part of the bill out of pocket,\u201d he says.\n\nToday I\u2019m offering five tips on how to best use your dental benefits to save you money and frustration.\n\nCHOOSE THE RIGHT PLAN\n\nIt\u2019s open-enrollment season, time to determine which dental plan is best for you.\n\nThere are two primary types of dental plans: HMOs and PPOs.\n\nThe vast majority of Californians with commercial dental coverage \u2014 more than 14 million \u2014 have PPOs, the NADP says.\n\nHere\u2019s how a dental PPO works:\n\nIn addition to your monthly premiums, you may owe a deductible before your insurance kicks in. Deductibles typically are under $50 and generally aren\u2019t applied to preventive services, Album says.\n\nYou face annual limits on your coverage, typically between $1,000 and $2,000, which is the maximum your insurance will pay out in one year.\n\nTwice-yearly cleanings and other preventive services are usually fully covered. You\u2019ll pay a percentage of the cost for other services, such as 20 percent for a filling or 50 percent for a crown. Which adds up fast.\n\nA dental HMO operates differently.\n\nYour premiums will be lower.\n\nYou probably won\u2019t have deductibles or benefit maximums.\n\nYou\u2019ll pay fixed copayments for treatments.\n\nHowever, with an HMO, \u201cyour choices of dentists is much, much smaller,\u201d Album says.\n\nHow much smaller? About 90 percent of California\u2019s practicing dentists participate in PPOs, whereas about one quarter participate in HMOs, the NADP says.\n\nYou may also have fewer treatment options with an HMO, says Long Beach dentist Gary Glasband. For example, an HMO may agree to cover a metal crown. But if you prefer a ceramic crown that blends in with your other teeth, you may have to pay an additional cost, he says.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to look at this choice differently if you\u2019re a 20-year-old who has very little dental needs compared to someone who needs complex work,\u201d he says.\n\nIf you have children, consider whether the plan covers orthodontic benefits, Glasband adds.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen your plan, understand your coverage. For instance, if your plan covers two cleanings a year, can they occur at any time or do they have to be more than six months apart?\n\n\u201cOne cleaning every six months is not the same as two cleanings a year,\u201d Glasband says.\n\nSTAY IN NETWORK\n\nYou will spend the least amount out of pocket by staying in your dental plan\u2019s network, whether you have an HMO or a PPO.\n\nWith an HMO, you usually won\u2019t receive any coverage out of network.\n\nIn the case of a PPO, you will receive the highest level of coverage from an in-network dentist plus reduced rates on the amount you have to spend out of pocket, Album says.\n\nIf you opt for an out-of-network dentist, you will still receive coverage, but at a reduced level.\n\nOnce your dentist has determined your treatment, always request a pre-treatment estimate from your plan. That will help you determine how much you\u2019ll owe, Album says.\n\nTIMING IS EVERYTHING\n\nSchedule your procedures to make the most of your dental coverage.\n\nLet\u2019s say your dentist recommends four fillings and two crowns. If you do them all at once, you\u2019ll likely exceed your maximum benefits and spend hundreds of dollars (or more) out of pocket.\n\nIf it\u2019s not an emergency, find out when your annual benefits renew, Glasband says. For most people it\u2019s Jan. 1.\n\nIn that case, Glasband suggests getting two fillings and a crown in November and the remaining procedures early the following year, which essentially doubles the amount of coverage at your disposal.\n\n\u201cCount on your dentist to help you time your benefits,\u201d Album says.\n\nSHOP AROUND\n\nLike medical procedures, the prices of dental treatments can vary dramatically within the same region.\n\nWhy should you care about prices if you\u2019re insured? Remember your annual maximums, which are easily surpassed with one dental procedure.\n\n\u201cEven if you have great coverage, you could be paying hundreds of dollars more out of pocket by choosing one dentist over another one down the street,\u201d says Jason Szczuka, general manager of Brighter.com, a California company that manages dental benefits for some businesses.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to call around and ask dentists for their prices, he says.\n\nYou can also check online resources such as FAIR Health\u2019s \u201cDental Cost Lookup\u201d tool at FairHealthConsumer.org to get an idea of how much others are being charged for similar services.\n\nDISCOUNT PLANS\n\nIf you don\u2019t have dental insurance, consider purchasing a discount dental plan. These plans, which are not insurance, give you access to certain dentists who have agreed to perform procedures at discounted, cash prices.\n\nThe discounts are usually 20 to 30 percent, sometimes more, says Evelyn Ireland, executive director of the NADP.\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in purchasing one, she suggests using the \u201cFind a Dental Plan\u201d tool on NADP\u2019s website (www.nadp.org), or checking with DentalPlans.com or retailers such as Costco.\n\n\n\nClick here to find previous Ask Emily columns.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2c54\"", "article_summary": "DISCOUNT PLANSIf you don\u2019t have dental insurance, consider purchasing a discount dental plan.\nCHOOSE THE RIGHT PLANIt\u2019s open-enrollment season, time to determine which dental plan is best for you.\nWhile dental insurance doesn\u2019t command the attention that medical insurance does, it also can have significant implications for your pocketbook.\nToday I\u2019m offering five tips on how to best use your dental benefits to save you money and frustration.\nIf you\u2019re interested in purchasing one, she suggests using the \u201cFind a Dental Plan\u201d tool on NADP\u2019s website (www.nadp.org), or checking with DentalPlans.com or retailers such as Costco."}
