If convicted of murder, they could face life in prison.\n\nThe teens are accused of killing Kee Thompson and Allison Gorman by smashing their heads repeatedly with cinder blocks and other items while they slept on mattresses in an open field. The incident shook Albuquerque, which already is under scrutiny for the way its homeless population is treated.\n\nRELATED: Mayor Richard J. Berry: Albuquerque Is Dangerous for Homeless Natives\n\nThe case has gained national attention because of the ages of the teens and the brutality of the crime. Albuquerque Police spokesman Simon Drobik described it as \u201ckids killing transients.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen all you know is that two people are dead and juveniles are in custody, it\u2019s hard to wrap your brain around it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was such a heinous crime and the nature of violence was so traumatic.\u201d\n\nThe Bernalillo County District Attorney\u2019s Office brought the charges against the teens. A spokeswoman for that office said cases involving juveniles charged with first-degree murder automatically proceed through the district court\u2019s criminal division \u2013 not the juvenile division.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s state law,\u201d said Kayla Anderson, spokeswoman for the Office of the District Attorney. \u201cBy statute, the crime is a serious violent offense, so that\u2019s how they\u2019re charged.\u201d\n\nAccording to estimates from the state Public Defender\u2019s Office, about a dozen children every year are tried as adults in the Albuquerque area.\n\nAll three teens have pleaded not guilty, though they admitted to the murders in statements to police. Tafoya and Carrillo are in the Bernalillo County Juvenile Detention Center while Rios, who also faces charges of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, is at the Metropolitan Detention Center.\n\nDespite the ages of the two younger suspects, all three will be tried as adults because their first-degree murder charges define them as \u201cserious youthful offenders,\u201d said Jeff Buckels, managing attorney of the capital crimes unit for the Public Defender\u2019s Office of New Mexico. Buckels also is representing Carrillo in the case.\n\nNew Mexico law mandates that juveniles over the age of 15 charged with first-degree murder be transferred automatically to adult court, he said. Younger suspects or those charged with lesser crimes go through amenability hearings first.\n\n\u201cIf the child is 14 or younger, even if convicted of first-degree murder, he has to go through a hearing to determine whether he\u2019s amenable to treatment,\u201d Buckels said. \u201cIf you\u2019re 15 to 17 years old and charged with first-degree murder, there is no hearing. You go straight to adult court.\u201d\n\nShould the teens be convicted, their sentences could vary because of the differences in age, Buckels said. Adults convicted of first-degree murder receive mandatory life sentences, which are defined as 30 years without the possibility of parole, but judges have more leeway when sentencing juveniles convicted of the same crime.\n\nThe Albuquerque community has hosted several memorials and vigils to honor the murder victims. Gorman, 44, was from Shiprock, New Mexico, and Thompson, who was either 45 or 46, left his home in Church Rock, New Mexico, in 2005. Both men\u2019s families said they went to Albuquerque looking for more opportunities.\n\nRELATED: Victims of Brutal Joy Killing Had Come Looking for Work\n\nFollowing the murders, Albuquerque\u2019s nine-member city council narrowly approved an excise tax increase of one-eighth of one percent on gross receipts with the revenue earmarked for helping people struggling with homelessness, mental illness or addiction. The tax, which would add 12.5 cents to a $100 purchase, could generate as much as $16 million per year.\n\nRELATED: Albuquerque May Pass Homeless Tax: $16m to Help the Needy\n\nCouncilors voted 5-4 on August 18 to approve the tax hike.
