This season the Little Irish aren't perfect, but they might be better for it.

"I don't think you ever want to lose, but I think you learn from those loses," says Grosodonia.

David Vito says, "We got one of the loses really early in the year. Second game to Canisius, which was kind of humbling to us, show that we are mortal."

Aquinas is in position to do something no other high school ever has: Win a state championship in both football and boys basketball.

"My top 7-8 guys are all football players," says Grosodonia. "They were all on that team, played big parts on that team, so they've been there, they understand what it takes."

"You build leaders through the state championship football team. We didn't really lead by word of mouth but I feel like we lead by word of action," says Hawkes. "Everything is just desperate here, desperate to score, desperate to win and desperate to win championships."

Only two more games stand between Aquinas and another state championship.
