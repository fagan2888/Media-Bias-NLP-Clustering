Americans can begin to enroll in state-based exchanges on Oct. 1 to take advantage of coverage and subsidies that begin next year.\n\n\u201cHowever, there are no new subsidized insurance options for families with incomes below the poverty level because lawmakers assumed they would be eligible for the Medicaid expansion; they did not anticipate the Supreme Court decision,\u201d the Commonwealth Fund said.\n\nThere is no deadline for states to expand Medicaid. They may opt in or out on a quarterly basis.\n\nWhile state officials consider the issue, the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s research said Congress could craft a solution that allows residents who earn less than the federal poverty level yet are not eligible for Medicaid to obtain government subsides on the state exchanges.\n\n\u201cThis would ensure that all Americans have access to the law\u2019s sweeping new reforms when they take effect in January,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nSome Republican governors, despite their distaste for Obamacare, have pushed their state legislatures to expand Medicaid, citing its economic and social benefits. The federal government will pick up 100 percent of the tab for the expanded population in 2014-2016, before scaling back its contribution to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond.\n\nYet conservatives such as Texas Gov. Rick Perry are skeptical that Washington will live up to its promises, and they warn that a health program they view as broken will bust their state budgets down the road.\n\nCritics of Obamacare say the law is flawed and imposes too many burdens on Americans, businesses and the federal budget. Advocates of expansion say those declining federal funds to help poorer residents gain health insurance is mean-spirited and missing out on a good deal for state coffers.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton, who promoted the health care law in a speech Wednesday, criticized states that have opted not to expand Medicaid and, as a consequence, left people in the lurch because they are \u201ctoo poor\u201d to gain benefits.\n\n\u201cNot too rich, too poor,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is a serious problem.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two in five adults who were uninsured at some point in the past two years and live in states that opted not to expand their Medicaid enrollment under President Obama's health care overhaul will not be able to take advantage of new coverage options under the sweeping law, according to a new study.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Two in five adults who were uninsured at some point in the past two years and live in states that opted not to expand their Medicaid enrollment under President Obama\u2019s health care overhaul will not be able to take advantage of new coverage options under the sweeping law, according to a new study.", "title": "Many will not get Obamacare benefits in states resisting Medicaid push: study", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/5/many-will-not-get-obamacare-benefits-states-resist/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2011/11/14/supreme-court-health-_live.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2011/11/14/supreme-court-health-_live.jpg", "description": "Two in five adults who were uninsured at some point in the past two years and live in states that opted not to expand their Medicaid enrollment under President Obama's health care overhaul will not be", "card": "summary", "title": "Many will not get Obamacare benefits in states resisting Medicaid push"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Social Issues, Commonwealth Fund"}, "article_summary": "Some Republican governors, despite their distaste for Obamacare, have pushed their state legislatures to expand Medicaid, citing its economic and social benefits.\nSo far, fewer than half of the states have decided to expand Medicaid within their borders next year.\nThere is no deadline for states to expand Medicaid.\nSPECIAL COVERAGE: Health Care ReformThe Commonwealth study says that puts some low-income residents in a pickle in the 22 states that have decided not to expand and the four states that are still mulling their options.\nThe Affordable Care Act established government subsidies to defray the cost of private insurance among those making between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level."}
