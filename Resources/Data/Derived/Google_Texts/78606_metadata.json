Though the bill has zero chance of becoming law because of a certain veto by President Obama, it is \u2013 by the Democrats\u2019 count \u2013 the 61st time the House has voted to repeal all or significant parts of the health reform law.\n\nWhy, people often ask me, do Republicans hate the ACA so much?\n\nThis past week\u2019s New York Times Upshot article, I believe, provides a major part of the answer. Briefly, \u201cIt\u2019s the taxes on the wealthy, stupid.\u201d Specifically, it\u2019s about two new Medicare taxes that went into effect in 2013 only on higher income Americans.\n\nACA Medicare Part A Payroll Tax: Beginning in 2013, individuals with earnings above $200,000 and married couples making more than $250,000 got an increase in the Medicare part A payroll tax of 2.35 percent, up from 1.45 percent (a 0.9 percent increase), on adjusted income over the threshold. (2016-25 take = $123 billion.) ACA Unearned Income Tax: This same group also now pays a new 3.8 percent unearned income (capital gains) tax on interest, dividends, annuities, royalties, rents, and gains on the sale of investments over the threshold. (2016-25 take = $222.8 billion.)\n\nIt\u2019s a lot of money and it\u2019s a lot of money taken exclusively from the top 5 percent of America\u2019s wealthiest ($345.8 billion between 2016-25).\n\nAs the Times article makes clear, these new taxes are so damn big (when combined with higher taxes from the 2012 American Taxpayer Relief Act) that both increases literally reversed the majority of the last 20 years decline in the effective tax rate of America\u2019s 400 wealthiest taxpayers!\n\nEvery leading candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination has a tax reform proposal that promises major tax cuts for the wealthiest. If there\u2019s anything close to doctrinal orthodoxy among today\u2019s Republican political class, it is the inviolability of lowering taxes for the upper class. The ACA not only raised taxes on the wealthiest, it committed the most heinous offense imaginable to Republicans by increasing taxes on unearned income.\n\nAnd it\u2019s true, these folks get bupkis in benefits from the ACA.\n\nBut what about the individual mandate? Isn\u2019t that reason enough to hate the ACA? No. It emerged in the late 1980s/early 1990s into the public\u2019s consciousness because of Republican/conservative advocacy: Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole, the Heritage Foundation, on and on. They only abandoned it when Obama and Democrats embraced it.\n\nWhat about states\u2019 rights and the federal takeover of health care as the ACA does? Like Democrats, Republicans are opportunistic federalists, embracing that value when it suits their larger objectives and discarding it when inconvenient. For example, every Republican-controlled state could pass a law tomorrow to permit their citizens to buy health insurance across state lines \u2014 a boilerplate Republican proposal. They don\u2019t do it because it doesn\u2019t make sense and it\u2019s a phony solution. State likes Georgia that tried it got zero takers. So national Republicans routinely propose to override state sovereignty and require that all states mess up their health insurance marketplaces to allow this.\n\nBut taxes on the wealthiest \u2014 no wobbly or wiggle room there. Many ironies pervade this. In 2009-10, if Republicans had continued to cooperate on health reform with Democrats, abandonment of these wealth taxes would have been a bottom-line demand that Democrats would have accepted as the price to get a bipartisan deal. Indeed, the Senate wanted all ACA financing to come from within the health sector itself (including a much, much larger \u201cCadillac Tax\u201d that was just postponed for two years); the House of Representatives demanded taxes on the wealthy, and that was a compromise between the two chambers. A little over 20 percent of ACA financing comes from the new Medicare taxes on earned and unearned income \u2014 a lot and much less than the House preferred.\n\nFinally, worth keeping in mind that the ACA\u2019s new taxes, while substantial, don\u2019t look all that big in the context of the other major tax packages approved since 1950, as the chart below shows.\n\nSo why don\u2019t Republicans talk about repealing these taxes as part of their shticks? Fair question \u2014 I believe doing so would badly dilute their ACA repeal message about saving US health care. So repeal of the dreaded Medicare taxes can only happen in the context of full ACA repeal \u2014 and that is one of the main substantive reasons why Republicans must keep going back to this well.\n\nMeet the Author John E.
