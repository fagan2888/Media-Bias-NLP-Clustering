Caruso, Houston Department of Health and Human Services, and Karen W. Cullen, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine. \u201cNational School Lunch Program guidelines restrict energy-dense foods such as sweetened beverages, snack chips, and desserts, but many students (90 percent) had these foods in their lunches from home.\u201d\n\nThe National School Lunch Act was signed by President Harry Truman in 1946 and provided cash subsidies to schools that provide meals that meet federal requirements and offer low-cost or free meals to eligible children. The nutritional requirements were updated in 2010 for the first time in over 30 years.\n\n\u201cMajor changes included the establishment of minimum and maximum calorie allowances; increased servings of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains; vegetable variety; the elimination of high-fat fluid milk options; and a gradual reduction in sodium content,\u201d according to the study published in the current issue of JAMA Pediatrics.\n\nBut the guidelines are only for lunches provided to students by the school. Those nutritional requirements are not being followed as closely by parents at home.\n\n\u201cAbout 90 percent of home lunches contained sweetened beverages, chips, and desserts, none of which are allowable in the federally reimbursed school lunch program and are not allowed to be sold in the cafeteria or on campus,\u201d said Virginia A. Stallings, MD, Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. \u201cNot surprisingly, home-brought sweetened beverages, chips, and desserts were fully consumed when provided.\u201d\n\nFirst Lady Michelle Obama has been instrumental in leading the effort to improve nutrition in schools. But some students are not as satisfied as they have been blaming Mrs. Obama for lunches described as \u201cyucky\u201d or \u201cgross.\u201d Students have been posting photos online of meals they consider to be \u201cunfortunate\u201d with the sarcastic hashtag #ThanksMichelleObama.\n\n-Brad Broker\n\n(Photo by DC Central Kitchen via Flickr)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Physicians News", "description": "Which is better: school lunches provided under new federal, nutritional guidelines or a lunch packed by Mom or Dad at home?
