The Florida Highway Patrol is investigating a fatal crash from earlier Sunday afternoon.

48 year old Alford resident David Perez was riding his motorcycle in Northern Bay County on Highway 388 South of Burnt Mill Creek Road just before 4:00.

As he tried to turn right, Perez seemed to have lost control and ran off the road.

He crashed into a tree and officials pronounced him dead at the scene.

Officials say he was not wearing a helmet.
