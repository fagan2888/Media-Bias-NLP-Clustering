The program employs specially trained officers, known as Behavior Detection Officers, to watch and interact with passengers going through screening. The document listing the criteria, known as the \u201cSpot Referral Report,\u201d is not classified, but it has been closely held by TSA and has not been previously released. A copy was provided to The Intercept by a source concerned about the quality of the program. The checklist ranges from the mind-numbingly obvious, like \u201cappears to be in disguise,\u201d which is worth three points, to the downright dubious, like a bobbing Adam\u2019s apple. Many indicators, like \u201ctrembling\u201d and \u201carriving late for flight,\u201d appear to confirm allegations that the program picks out signs and emotions that are common to many people who fly.\n\nThe TSA responded to The Intercept\u2019s inquiries about the document by calling it \u201cjust one element\u201d of its strategy to \u201cmitigate threats against the traveling public,\u201d but the journalists who reported the story, Cora Currier and Jana Winter, point out that strong evidence exists that these kinds of programs are very ineffective in accurately identifying or predicting passengers who may want to cause harm.\n\n\u201cThe TSA has insisted on keeping documents about SPOT secret, but the agency can\u2019t hide the fact that there\u2019s no evidence the program works,\u201d said Hugh Handeyside, a staff attorney with the ACLU which just filed a lawsuit against the agency for failing to publicly disclose requested information about the SPOT program.\n\nOne former Behavior Detection Officer manager, who asked not to be identified, told Currier and Winter that the TSA approach to profiling passengers suffers from both lack of science and simple inconsistency, with every airport training its officers differently. \u201cThe SPOT program is bullshit,\u201d the manager told The Intercept. \u201cComplete bullshit.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"The SPOT program is bullshit,\" the manager told The Intercept. \"Complete bullshit.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Jon Queally | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "\"The SPOT program is bullshit,\" the manager told The Intercept. \"Complete bullshit.\"", "title": "\"You Might Be a Terrorist If ...\": Leaked Document Reveals Secret TSA Check List", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/you-might-be-a-terrorist-if-leaked-document-reveals-secret-tsa-check-list/203820/", "image": "https://commondreams.org/sites/default/files/tsa-spotcheck.png", "updated_time": "2015-03-28T13:58:17-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"The SPOT program is bullshit,\" the manager told The Intercept. \"Complete bullshit.\"", "creator": "@jonqueally", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/AP1001041332.jpg", "title": "\"You Might Be a Terrorist If ...\": Leaked Document Reveals Secret TSA Check List", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "TSA", "published_time": "2015-03-28T05:00:53-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-28T13:58:17-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaca9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou Might Be a Terrorist If \u2026\u201d: Leaked Document Reveals Secret TSA Check List\"The SPOT program is bullshit,\" the manager told The Intercept.\nThe program employs specially trained officers, known as Behavior Detection Officers, to watch and interact with passengers going through screening.\n\u201cThe SPOT program is bullshit,\u201d the manager told The Intercept.\nThe document listing the criteria, known as the \u201cSpot Referral Report,\u201d is not classified, but it has been closely held by TSA and has not been previously released.\nA copy was provided to The Intercept by a source concerned about the quality of the program."}
