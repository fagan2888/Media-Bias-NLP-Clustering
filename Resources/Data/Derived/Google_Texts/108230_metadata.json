They ask to be left alone at this time.\u201d\n\nIslamic State militants have beheaded two American journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, as well as Kurdish and Lebanese fighters, and posted video evidence online. At the end of the last video showing the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff, the Islamic State group threatened to kill Haines next and briefly showed him on camera.\n\nIn the video posted Sunday, the group threatened to kill another Briton. Both British men were dressed in orange jumpsuits against an arid Syrian landscape, similar to that seen in the Foley and Sotloff videos.\n\nThe SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. terrorism watchdog, reported the video, which was also posted online by users associated with the Islamic State group.\n\nThe video was entitled \u201cA Message to the Allies of America.\u201d Haines\u2019 purported killer, who appeared to be the same man speaking with a British accent as in the previous videos, tells the British government that its alliance with the U.S. will only \u201caccelerate your destruction\u201d and will drag the British people into \u201canother bloody and unwinnable war\u201d.\n\nHaines was abducted in Syria in 2013 while working for an international aid agency.\n\nThe British government had managed to keep his kidnapping secret out of concern for his safety until the most recent video identified him as a captive.\n\nLate Friday, the family of Haines issued a public plea urging his captors to contact them.\n\nIn a short statement released through Britain\u2019s Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the family said: \u201cWe are asking those holding David to make contact with us.\u201d\n\nAFP and AP contributed to this report", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Islamic State jihadist group claimed it executed British aid worker David Haines, in retaliation for British leader David Cameron entering a coalition with the United States against the militants", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The Islamic State jihadist group claimed it executed British aid worker David Haines, in retaliation for British leader David Cameron entering a coalition with the United States against the militants", "title": "Islamic State claims beheading of British hostage David Haines - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Peace/2014/09/04/David-Haines-ISIS-beheading-threat-afp.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2014/09/13/islamic-state-claims-beheading-of-british-hostage-site/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Islamic State jihadist group claimed it executed British aid worker David Haines, in retaliation for British leader David Cameron entering a coalition with the United States against the militants", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Peace/2014/09/04/David-Haines-ISIS-beheading-threat-afp.jpg", "title": "Islamic State claims beheading of British hostage David Haines - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Beheading, ISIS, Syria,Breitbart London,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart London", "tag": "Syria", "published_time": "2014-09-13T16:17:00-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart London"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2537\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Islamic State jihadist group claimed it executed British aid worker David Haines, in retaliation for British leader David Cameron entering a coalition with the United States against the militants.\nThe SITE Intelligence Group, a U.S. terrorism watchdog, reported the video, which was also posted online by users associated with the Islamic State group.\nAt the end of the last video showing the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff, the Islamic State group threatened to kill Haines next and briefly showed him on camera.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Islamist group released a video, available on the website of private terrorism monitoring group SITE, purportedly showing a masked militant beheading Haines.\nThis would be the third such execution in recent weeks, after two US journalists taken hostage in Syria were shown murdered."}
