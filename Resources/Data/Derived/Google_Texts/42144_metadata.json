They will also compete in a mid-show game concerning the magical properties of alkie-hol. Also, the co-hosts (and the good people of New York) will offer their own favorite cures for alcoholic, economic, and even hoarding hangovers.\n\nFox News Channel Digital Politics Editor Chris Stirewalt will break down what the GOP-led Congress will do know that they've woken up to power. Fox Business Making Money host Charles Payne will talk about how to fulfill the title of his show after the Christmas binge.
