John Kasich and Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas took their turns at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, in separate speeches. The fourth remaining candidate\u2014businessman Donald Trump\u2014canceled his planned Saturday appearance the day before, saying he wanted to travel instead to Kansas and Florida.\n\nThe Daily Signal compiled some of the policy highlights offered by Cruz, Rubio, and Kasich to set themselves apart from President Barack Obama and other Democrats:\n\nSen. Ted Cruz:\n\nIf he were to win the Republican nomination, Cruz told the audience Friday night, he plans on making the general election about three things: jobs, liberty, and security.\n\nSmall Business Regulations\n\nCruz said the \u201cheart of the economy isn\u2019t Washington, D.C. It\u2019s not New York City. The heart of our economy is the small businesses all over this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to crush the economy? Hammer small business like we have over the last seven years,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cYou want to unchain the economy? Lift the boot of the government off the backs of the necks of small businesses.\u201d\n\nCruz said he would abolish the Internal Revenue Service and install an across-the-board flat tax in its place. The Texas Republican said that under a Cruz administration, taxpayers could calculate what they owe \u201con the back of a postcard.\u201d\n\nObamacare\n\nCruz told the crowd that he would \u201crepeal every word of Obamacare.\u201d In its place, he promised to lead the effort to pass \u201ccommon sense health care reform.\u201d That plan, he said, would \u201cmake health care personal, portable, and affordable.\u201d\n\nIt would \u201ckeep government from getting between us and our doctors,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nIllegal Immigration\n\nBorder security is a top issue, Cruz said. \u201cImmigration is a law enforcement matter. Immigration is a national security matter. But at its heart, immigration is an economic matter,\u201d he said, adding:\n\nWhen you allow 12 million people to come to this country illegally, you take away millions of jobs from U.S. citizens and from legal immigrants and you drive down wages for everyone.\n\nSupreme Court\n\nUntil after the next president is elected, Senate Republicans have pledged to keep open the seat vacated by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. So, Cruz noted, the election is about the control of two branches of government.\n\nCruz, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said a liberal justice could tip the ideological balance of the court with significant consequences.\n\n\u201cWe are one liberal justice away from the Supreme Court ruling that government can take our religious liberty away and force every one of us to violate our faith on penalty of prison or poverty,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Cruz\u2019s view, a liberal nominee could endanger the Bill of Rights, the Second Amendment, and even the war memorials of veterans.\n\nNational Security\n\nCruz promised to be a strong commander in chief, \u201cwilling to utter the words \u2018radical Islamic terrorism.\u2019\u201d After identifying the enemy, Cruz said, he would deploy overwhelming force.\n\n\u201cAmerica has always been reluctant to use military force. We are slow to anger,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if and when military force is required, we should use overwhelming force, kill the enemy, and then get the heck out.\u201d\n\nDismissing charges that he is a warmonger, Cruz said his national security outlook is \u201cexactly the opposite.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe, like Ronald Reagan, in peace through strength. I actually think the weakness of Barack Obama invites military conflict and it encourages our enemies,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Blue Lives Matter\u2019\n\nWhen Fox News host Sean Hannity joined Cruz on stage, the Texas senator answered one question rhetorically: \u201cWhen did it become controversial to say every human being is precious?\u201d\n\nCritiquing the Black Lives Matter movement, Cruz accused Democratic rivals of being afraid to say \u201call lives matter.\u201d Pointing to New York City, he credited the New York Police Department with dramatically reducing the murder rate. He said:\n\nTalk about the thousands of black lives that have been saved because of the bravery of our police officers. All lives matter, but let me tell you blue lives matter. And we will stand with the men and women who protect us.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio\n\nRubio addressed a wide range of issues Saturday, including abortion and the fundamentals of conservatism. The Florida senator first made a speech to CPAC attendees, then took questions from CNN reporter Dana Bash.\n\nFounding Principles\n\nRubio began with the main ingredients of America\u2019s founding.\n\n\u201cWhat will solve our problems is a specific set of ideas built on the bedrock of principles that made America the greatest nation to begin with and applying those principles to the challenges of this new century\u2014and those principles are not complicated,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nHe stressed that while many liberals believe rights come from government, conservatives such as himself disagree.\n\n\u201cIt begins with the notion that this nation was founded on a powerful, spiritual principle that our rights do not come from government,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cOur rights do not come from our laws. Our rights do not come from our leaders. Our rights come from God.\u201d\n\nLimited Government\n\nRubio, first elected to the Senate in 2010, rejected the idea that government is needed to solve problems Americans face in their everyday lives.\n\n\u201cWe have reached a moment in our history where we think that every problem in America has to have a federal government solution,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery problem in America does not have a federal government solution. In fact, most problems in America do not have a federal government solution, and many are created by the federal government to begin with.\u201d\n\nFree Enterprise\n\nIn many of Rubio\u2019s speeches, he recalls his parents\u2019 backgrounds, and his CPAC address was no different. Both Cuban-born immigrants, his mother worked as a maid and his father as a bartender.\n\nHis parents worked hard to build good lives for their four children, Rubio said, and he attributed that opportunity to free enterprise.\n\n\u201cDo you know why my parents had a job? Because free enterprise works,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause someone created those jobs. With those jobs, they were able to feed their families and raise them and buy a home for a better future. Free enterprise is the best economic system in the history of the world because it\u2019s the only system where you can make poor people richer and you don\u2019t have to make rich people poorer.\u201d\n\nNational Defense\n\nIn outlining the key tenets of conservatism, Rubio emphasized the need for a strong national defense, but also stressed that showing strength doesn\u2019t always mean going to war.\n\n\u201cConservatism means believing in a strong national defense not because we love war, but because we love peace, because history has taught us a painful lesson that weakness is the enemy of peace.\u201d\n\nSupreme Court\n\nSenate Democrats continue to accuse Republicans of obstruction for their decision not to hold hearings for anyone Obama nominates to fill Scalia\u2019s seat on the nation\u2019s highest court. Rubio is among Senate Republicans stressing that the American people, voting for a new president in November, should have a say in who the next justice is.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court can function with eight justices. The number nine is set by Congress. I\u2019m not advocating we do this, but if we wanted to change it to eight or seven, we could. There\u2019s no magic number nine,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nHe warned of the consequences of allowing Obama to appoint a new justice during his last year in office.\n\n\u201cThis president is completely unaccountable. He is going to be nominating someone to what is basically a lifetime appointment, and we can\u2019t hold it against him in an election,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to have a debate in this country over this. There\u2019s going to be an election in November. God willing, we\u2019re going to nominate and elect a conservative. That conservative will then appoint, I hope, someone more like Justice Scalia than the kind of nominees we\u2019ve gotten out of this president.\u201d\n\nTerrorism\n\nRubio said he supports aggressive, or enhanced, interrogation techniques when necessary to obtain crucial information from terrorists.\n\n\u201cYou cannot use the same interrogation techniques on a terrorist that you do on a criminal. Here\u2019s why. When you are interrogating a criminal, what you are trying to do is gather evidence for a trial so you can convict them,\u201d Rubio said:\n\nWhen you are interrogating a terrorist, what you are trying to do is gather information to prevent a future terrorist attack. It\u2019s not about evidence for trial. And I don\u2019t talk about interrogating techniques. Do you know why I don\u2019t talk about interrogation techniques? Because when you describe interrogation techniques, terrorists can now, and they do, practice evading interrogation techniques\u2014how to evade telling you the truth.\n\n\u201cSo we are going to interrogate terrorists, but right now that\u2019s not even an issue,\u201d he said.\n\nRubio said he would leave open the detention center for captured enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a facility Obama wants to close.\n\n\u201cRight now Barack Obama doesn\u2019t send [terrorists] anywhere. He\u2019s releasing terrorists from Guantanamo,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWho are we gonna interrogate? When I\u2019m president, if we capture a terrorist, they\u2019re going to Guantanamo, and we will find out everything they know.\u201d\n\nAbortion and the Sanctity of Life\n\nRubio said he believes life begins at conception, and told CPAC attendees how his Christian faith determines his pro-life stance.\n\n\u201cMy faith influences me to believe that all human life, all human life, is worthy of the protection of our laws.\u201d\n\nRace Relations\n\nCNN\u2019s Bash, using a question from the social media site Twitter, asked Rubio how he would unite the country, particularly in a time of growing racial tensions and violence against police officers.\n\n\u201cWe have tremendous admiration and respect for our police officers, and I thank God every day for what they do for our families,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nThe Florida senator acknowledged a growing divide between and among races, then turned the issue back to free enterprise.\n\n\u201cI also think in this country, irrespective of police departments, putting aside the police department issue, yes, there are significant number of Americans that live in majority minority communities who think they\u2019re locked out of the American dream,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd if a significant percentage of the American family feels like they\u2019re being left behind, we have an issue, and we have to confront it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s how we\u2019re going to confront it. We\u2019re going to confront it by embracing free enterprise. It is the only economic model in the world where you can make people better off without pulling anyone else down.\u201d He added:\n\nI believe free enterprise works because I\u2019ve lived it. My parents would never have been able to achieve for our family what they achieved in America anywhere else on the planet. Because almost anywhere else in the world, your future is decide by whether or not your parents are the right people or connected to the right people. Not in America. That\u2019s not who we\u2019ve been. That\u2019s not who we\u2019re going to be. \u2026 In the end, all this hyphenation stuff, that\u2019s fine, but we\u2019re all Americans.\n\nGov. John Kasich\n\nTreatment for Drug Abusers, Mentally Ill\n\nIn a nod toward criminal justice reform in his speech Friday afternoon, Kasich called for providing treatment for drug users and the mentally ill as alternatives to prison.\n\n\u201cI come from the [Ronald] Reagan and [Jack] Kemp school,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cWhen our economies are doing better, we have an obligation to reach out to those people who live in the shadows, to give them an opportunity to achieve their God-given potential\u2014that means the mentally ill.\n\n\u201cThe mentally ill should not be sleeping under a bridge or living in our prisons. They have a right to be treated and get on their feet and assume their God-given purpose. Let\u2019s give everyone a chance to rise.\u201d\n\nAppeal to Millennials\n\nKasich implored an audience largely made up of millennials to keep their faith, chase their dreams, and give back.\n\n\u201cI have a message to the young people who are here today,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cYou should all know that that you were all made special. Nobody has ever been made like you and no one ever will.\n\n\u201cI believe the Lord makes us special for a special purpose. And your job is to find those gifts and live a life bigger than yourself, and change the world in which you live.\u201d\n\nState Powers\n\nThe Ohio governor and former congressman said he believes the private sector should drive the economy, and that local and state government are better boosters of economic success than the federal government.\n\n\u201cThe strength of our country, the vitality of our country, the spirit of our country, rests in our families, our neighbors, our communities, our states,\u201d Kasich said, adding:\n\nDon\u2019t wait for somebody to come and fix the problems where you are. Fix them yourself. Send education, welfare, infrastructure, healthcare for the poor, and job training, all back to where you live, and you\u2019ll have more power because we have to run America from the bottom up. That\u2019s what works.\n\nLimited Government\n\nKasich said he would fulfill traditional Republican priorities, promising fewer regulations and taxes and a balanced budget.\n\nHe said it is important for a president to develop a strong working relationship with Congress.\n\n\u201cI am going to [have] a plan to reduce federal regulations, to reduce taxes on businesses and individuals, and have a plan to balance the budget,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cWe are going to fix Social Security, fix the border, have immigration taken care of, and restore relations with our allies.\n\n\u201cWe need shock and awe down there and to say to the Congress, this is where we are going, let\u2019s get together.\u201d\n\nTechnology and Innovation\n\nGovernment should stay out of the way when companies such as Uber shake up an industry with innovative ideas, Kasich said.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s Uberize the federal government,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cLet\u2019s Uberize all the government, and bring technology, innovation, and the speed of business to everything we do in government, and have some guts. The fact of the matter is we need to welcome innovation and change. It makes us new, fresh, and alive again.\u201d\n\nISIS\n\nKasich said U.S. ground troops will be required to defeat the Islamic State, the terrorist army also known as ISIS, in Iraq and Syria. But, he said, a combat force should be led by allied countries closer to the fight.\n\n\u201cWe have to do just like what we did to get Saddam [Hussein] out of Kuwait,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cYou get the Arabs, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states, and others, and bring our Western allies in the air, on the ground and destroy ISIS.\u201d\n\nThe Ohio governor also spoke against regime change in places such as Syria or Iran, saying America\u2019s primary focus should be protecting the homeland and its immediate interests:", "article_metadata": {"description": "What you need to know.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "What you need to know.", "title": "20 Highlights From Presidential Candidates\u2019 Speeches to Conservatives", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160305_CruzRubioKasich2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-07T11:11:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1X5x05x"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "What you need to know.", "title": "20 Highlights From Presidential Candidates\u2019 Speeches to Conservatives", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160305_CruzRubioKasich2.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2016-03-06T20:41:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-07T11:11:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "All lives matter, but let me tell you blue lives matter.\nMarco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas took their turns at the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, in separate speeches.\nThree of the four remaining Republican presidential candidates made their policy pitches Friday and Saturday to conservative grassroots voters at a conference outside Washington, D.C.Ohio Gov.\nHe stressed that while many liberals believe rights come from government, conservatives such as himself disagree.\nHe said:Talk about the thousands of black lives that have been saved because of the bravery of our police officers."}
