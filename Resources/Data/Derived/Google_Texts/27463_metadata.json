Like the time I had to chase after my mother\u2019s friend as she fled to the elevator when our conversation about whether or not John McCain was \u201cpro-choice\u201d got, uh, heated. I convinced her to come back inside the apartment only after promising I\u2019d drop the issue. (But for the record, John McCain does not support reproductive freedom. At all. Though maybe I shouldn\u2019t have told my mom\u2019s friend that she was \u201ctotally nuts\u201d when she refused to accept my point about his record.)\n\nOr that other time I found myself in an argument with a friend\u2019s father, explaining that \u201cpartial-birth abortion\u201d is not a medical procedure and that if he wanted to fight about reproductive health with me then he had to at least agree to use real words while doing so.\n\nNow of course I\u2019ve also had really respectful conversations with the people I love and disagree with about the things we think are important, but that\u2019s not always possible. And if you want to avoid arguments altogether this year, which some of you might, I am happy to recommend a way to do just that.\n\nComplain about mundane things! Indulge that feeling of injustice about something that actually does not matter at all! Everyone loves to complain! And others will support you in your complaints and then share their own complaints! It is the best, most unifying thing ever. In fact, if you do try to talk to your conservative relatives about politics and end up in an argument, try making amends by complaining together. It might help.\n\nHere are four completely inane and self-indulgent things that I will complain about with my relatives this year. Feel free to borrow them if you need something ridiculous and inconsequential to complain about. (But let\u2019s be real; you have plenty of such things to complain about. Everyone does.)\n\nHappy holidays!\n\nMy bed might be too soft and I think it\u2019s hurting my back.\n\nI love a soft bed. I basically want my bed to be a sinkhole of comfort. In pursuit of this goal, I recently added another mattress topper to my already mattress-topped bed. This has really upped my comfort game while, say, watching Netflix on my laptop, but I think it\u2019s also hurting my back. Every morning, I wake up with a tight, slightly crooked back.\n\nWhat do you do in such a situation? Sacrifice the womb-like comfort of a warm, overly cushioned bed or, you know, take care of your actual body? Hard to say, hard to say.\n\nSomeone in my neighborhood has this dog that barks a lot, and another neighbor regularly yells out his window at the barking dog.\n\nI don\u2019t know who this person is or where they live, but they live close enough that I can hear their barking dog when they let it out in their backyard. It\u2019s gotten better recently because the cold is ostensibly keeping the dog inside, but the pattern for months was basically this: I would wake up around 6 a.m. to the sound of a barking dog. The dog would be left outside for hours. Barking. Seemingly not unhappily or in distress. Just barking like a dog that barks a lot because that is dog language or whatever.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The family that kvetches together \u2026 makes it through dinner without any tears \u2026 together VIDEO", "title": "How to keep the peace with your conservative relatives this holiday: Complain together!", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The family that kvetches together \u2026 makes it through dinner without any tears \u2026 together VIDEO", "title": "How to keep the peace with your conservative relatives this holiday: Complain together!", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/25/how_to_keep_the_peace_with_your_conservative_relatives_this_holiday_complain_together/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/broken_ornament_resize.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The family that kvetches together \u2026 makes it through dinner without any tears \u2026 together VIDEO", "title": "How to keep the peace with your conservative relatives this holiday: Complain together!", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/broken_ornament_resize.jpg", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Abortion, Christmas, complaints, conervative, Family, holiday, John McCain, things to complain about, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d13\"", "article_summary": "Someone in my neighborhood has this dog that barks a lot, and another neighbor regularly yells out his window at the barking dog.\n(But for the record, John McCain does not support reproductive freedom.\nHere are four completely inane and self-indulgent things that I will complain about with my relatives this year.\nLike the time I had to chase after my mother\u2019s friend as she fled to the elevator when our conversation about whether or not John McCain was \u201cpro-choice\u201d got, uh, heated.\nIn fact, if you do try to talk to your conservative relatives about politics and end up in an argument, try making amends by complaining together."}
