Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley’s Virginia campaign chairman has been cut from the campaign after being arrested on two felony child porn charges.

Michael C. Teegarden, 51, is accused of involvement in “online trading of digital child pornography on a peer-to-peer file-sharing network,” The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported.

Mr. Teegarden was arrested Thursday morning after a search warrant was executed at his home, Hanover Sheriff’s Maj. Michael J. Trice said.

Haley Morris, a spokeswoman for Mr. O’Malley, the former Maryland governor, said Mr. Teegarden had been serving in a volunteer capacity and that the campaign “severed all ties with him immediately.”

“We’re horrified by these allegations, and if he is found guilty he should be punished to the full extent of the law,” Ms. Morris said, The Times-Dispatch reported.

Mr. Teegarden had been working for a financial advisory firm and previously worked as an assistant principal, teacher and coach in Virginia public schools.
