In 1986, NCD recommended enactment of an Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and drafted the first version of the bill which was introduced in the House and Senate in 1988. Since the ADA became law in 1990, NCD has continued to play a leading role in crafting policy solutions, and in advising the President, Congress and other federal agencies on disability policies, programs, and practices.\n\n###\n\nA photo accompanying this release is available at: http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/prs/?pkgid=36896\n\nLawrence Carter-Long Public Affairs Specialist National Council on Disability 1331 F Street, NW, Suite 850 Washington, DC 20004 202-272-2004 Voice 202-272-2074 TTY 202-272-2022 Fax", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON, Oct. 14, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The", "original-source": "http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/10/14/776161/10152517/en/Lt-Colonel-Daniel-M-Gade-Ph-D-Appointed-to-the-National-Council-on-Disability-by-Speaker-of-the-House-of-Representatives.html", "title": "Lt.
