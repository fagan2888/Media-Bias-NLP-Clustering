Boehner (R-OH) for not being able to pass a conservative agenda.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nObama said, \u201cThey want to defund Planned Parenthood. There\u2019s a way to do it. Pass a law, override my veto. That\u2019s true across a whole bunch of issues that they disagree with me on. That\u2019s how democracy works. I got no problem with it. But you have to govern. And I\u2019m hoping that the next speaker understands that the problem Speaker Boehner had, or Mitch McConnell had, in not dismantling ObamaCare, or not eliminating the Department of Education, or not deporting every immigrant in this country, was not because Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell didn\u2019t care about conservative principles. It had to do with the fact that they can\u2019t do it, in our system of government, which requires compromise. Just like I can\u2019t do everything I want in passing an immigration bill, or passing a gun-safety bill. And that doesn\u2019t mean that I throw a tantrum and try to wreck the economy and put hard-working Americans, who are just now able to dig themselves out of a massive recession, put them in harm\u2019s way. Wrong thing to do.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama Defends Boehner and McConnell: Our System Requires Compromise", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama Defends Boehner and McConnell: Our System Requires Compromise", "title": "Obama Defends Boehner, McConnell: Our System Requires 'Compromise' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/ob3.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/10/02/obama-defends-boehner-mcconnell-our-system-requires-compromise/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama Defends Boehner and McConnell: Our System Requires Compromise", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/ob3.jpg", "title": "Obama Defends Boehner, McConnell: Our System Requires 'Compromise' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Obama Defends Boehner and McConnell: Our System Requires Compromise", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Mitch McConnell", "published_time": "2015-10-02T14:49:59-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Obama"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "It had to do with the fact that they can\u2019t do it, in our system of government, which requires compromise.\nAnd I\u2019m hoping that the next speaker understands that the problem Speaker Boehner had, or Mitch McConnell had, in not dismantling ObamaCare, or not eliminating the Department of Education, or not deporting every immigrant in this country, was not because Speaker Boehner or Mitch McConnell didn\u2019t care about conservative principles.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERFriday at a press conference at the White House, President Barack Obama defended Majority Leader Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Speaker John A.
