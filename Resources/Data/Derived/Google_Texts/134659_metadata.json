Bill Walker announced two more commissioner appointees, however, not just the governor\u2019s cabinet is being rebuilt.\n\nTwo hundred state employees received letters asking them to resign to make room for Walker\u2019s hires, the governor\u2019s spokeswoman said.\n\nThe State of Alaska employs 16,000 people statewide. The 200 asked to resign were exempt employees, including commissioners, deputy commissioners and directors, spokeswoman Grace Jang said.\n\n\u201cThere were about 200 resignation form letters that went out,\u201d Jang said at a press conference at the capitol building Monday afternoon. \u201cNot everyone\u2019s resignation will be accepted.\u201d\n\nThe Walker administration might decide to keep on some of those asked to resign, she explained. As for the rest of the positions, \u201cthere have been hundreds of applications\u201d to fill the vacant spots. This kind of restructuring \u201cis pretty standard when it\u2019s an administration change,\u201d she said.\n\nJust hours after taking office, Walker appointed former Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium director and Medicaid expert Valerie Nurr\u2019araaluk Davidson as commissioner of the Department of Health and Social Services.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Walker said he would \u201cbegin the wheels in motion today to begin expanding Medicaid.\u201d He had promised during his campaign to expand the program to as many as 40,000 Alaskans \u2014 mostly low-income adults \u2014 who fall into the health insurance coverage gap. Appointing Davidson was the first step, he said at the afternoon press conference.\n\nWith new leadership in the department, \u201cwe will move (Medicaid expansion) as aggressively as we can,\u201d Walker said.\n\nFormer Gov. Sean Parnell announced a year ago that Alaska would not participate in Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Davidson, a Yup\u2019ik from Bethel, said she and Walker do not yet have a plan for rolling out the delayed expansion. She said the state has \u201clost out on considerable federal revenues\u201d by waiting to participate in the program \u2014 2014, 2015 and 2016 are the only years the federal government will foot the entire bill. After that, the state must pay a portion of the coverage.\n\nProviding health insurance for all will strengthen Alaska\u2019s economy as a by-product, Davidson said.\n\n\u201c(People) can\u2019t hunt, they can\u2019t fish if they\u2019re not healthy,\u201d she said. \u201cMy first job will be sitting down with the governor and talking about priorities.\u201d\n\nMarty Rutherford was selected as the deputy commissioner for the Department of Natural Resources. She held the position previously during former Gov. Sarah Palin\u2019s administration. Rutherford will serve as acting commissioner of the department until newly appointed Commissioner Mark Myers begins work Jan. 1.\n\nFormer state legislator Sam Cotten was selected by Walker as acting commissioner of the Department of Fish and Game. Cotten has served on several fisheries-related boards, including the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council. He was born in Juneau and lives in Eagle River.\n\nCotten is in the running to keep the job permanently, Walker said. The new governor is constitutionally obligated to appoint at least an acting commissioner to every department on his first day in office. Out of the list of Walker\u2019s appointees, only a few are permanent, as long as the Legislature approves them. The rest are considered \u201cacting\u201d or \u201cinterim.\u201d\n\nFour commissioners were carried over from the Parnell administration: the Department of Education and Early Development\u2019s Mike Hanley; the Department of Environmental Conservation\u2019s Larry Hartig; the Department of Public Safety\u2019s Gary Folger; and the Department of Transportation and Public Facilities\u2019 Patrick Kemp. Hanley, Hartig and Kemp are all listed as \u201cacting\u201d commissioners.\n\n\u201cIf it says \u2018acting,\u2019 it\u2019s a process and it\u2019s not finished,\u201d Jang said of the list of appointees. Another person could still be hired for the job.\n\nThe inauguration\n\nFrom the moment the Yakutat dance group filed into Centennial Hall\u2019s Sheffield Ballroom and began Walker and Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott\u2019s inauguration ceremony with a song that drew spectators out of their seats, it was clear that history was being made.\n\nDonning his clan\u2019s traditional regalia, Mallott was sworn in as Alaska\u2019s second lieutenant governor of Alaska Native heritage, the first of Tlingit heritage. Former Lt. Gov. Loren Leman, who served under Gov. Frank Murkowski, was of Alutiiq heritage.\n\nPiggybacking on the Alaska Federation of Natives Convention\u2019s \u201cRise as One\u201d theme, both Mallott\u2019s and Walker\u2019s inauguration speeches riffed on togetherness \u2014 racial and political.\n\n\u201cWe can reach out, we can understand, we can empathize,\u201d Mallott said during his speech.\n\nMallott\u2019s words drew a standing ovation and cheers from the crowd. Juneau was a strong backer of the former candidate for governor and continued to support him in his bid for lieutenant governor alongside Walker.\n\nMallott said after the inauguration that the day had been emotional for him.\n\n\u201cTo be able to wear my clan regalia on a day like this,\u201d he said, smiling.\n\nNative elder and leader David Kingeisti Katzeek gave a traditional welcome, delivered partially in Tlingit, at the ceremony. He asked the audience to join him in a chant of \u201cwooch.een\u201d \u2014 \u201cworking together.\u201d\n\n\u201cWooch.een, wooch.een, wooch.een,\u201d the crowd said, getting louder with every repetition.\n\nKatzeek said after the ceremony that electing Mallott is fulfilling a prophecy of sorts made by the Board of Indian Commissioners after the U.S. Army\u2019s 1869 bombardment of Wrangell. The board told the U.S. secretary of war after the attack that assimilating Native people was necessary to avoid them holding high office \u201cbecause of the discipline that they have,\u201d Katzeek said.\n\n\u201cIt did not mean we were better than anyone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt meant we had the ability to bring people together.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Contact reporter Katie Moritz at 523-2294 or at katherine.moritz@juneauempire.com.
