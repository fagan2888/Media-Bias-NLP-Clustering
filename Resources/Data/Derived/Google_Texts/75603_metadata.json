The group was up almost 24% on average, versus 9.4% for the S&P Healthcare index and just 1.2% for the S&P 500. While that kind of performance is tough to sustain, a new report from the analysts at UBS suggests that the group could have further room to run.\n\nTwo of the items the UBS team highlighted in the group are figured to be active in mergers and acquisitions. They also point out that the new public exchanges set up through the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, the viability of which was questioned two years ago, are now accepted as an important new avenue for MCO growth. The UBS report highlights four stocks to buy: Aetna Inc. (NYSE: AET), Anthem Inc. (NYSE: ANTM), Cigna Corp. (NYSE: CI) and UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE: UNH).\n\nAetna\n\nAetna makes the list and trades at just touch over 13 times 2015 estimated earnings. The company is one of the nation\u2019s leading diversified health care benefits companies, serving an estimated 44 million people while offering a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental, behavioral health, group life and disability plans, and medical management capabilities.\n\nALSO READ: The Top 5 Biotech Stocks of 2015 Have Average Gains So Far Over 200%\n\nAetna investors are paid a 0.95% dividend. The UBS price target for the stock jumps from $120 to $128. The Thomson/First Call consensus estimate is $126.35. The stock closed Wednesday at $107.29 a share.\n\nAnthem\n\nOne of the nation\u2019s leading health benefits companies, Anthem delivers quality products and services that give its members access to the care they need. With more than 68 million people served by its affiliated companies, including more than 37 million enrolled in its family of health plans, continued growth is not out of the question with an aging population that is living longer.\n\nThe company recently posted strong fourth-quarter 2014 earnings and shared a very positive outlook for 2015. The acquisition of Simply Healthcare Holdings also has contributed to the strong share price appreciation this year.\n\nAnthem investors are paid a 1.6% dividend. The UBS price target is lifted to $175 from $163, compared to a consensus target of $157.61. Shares closed Wednesday at $154.42 apiece.\n\nCigna\n\nThis major health services organization provides insurance and related products and services in the United States and internationally. All products and services are provided exclusively by or through operating subsidiaries, including Cigna Health and Life Insurance, Life Insurance Company of North America, Cigna Life Insurance Company of Canada, or affiliates.\n\nALSO READ: 4 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy for Market Safety\n\nThe health care giant offers an integrated suite of health services, such as medical, dental, behavioral health, pharmacy, vision, supplemental benefits and other related products, including group life, accident and disability insurance.

The UBS price target goes to $149 from $140, while the consensus target is down at $131.33.

The company offers a broad spectrum of products and services through two distinct platforms: UnitedHealthcare, which provides health care coverage and benefits services, and Optum, which provides information and technology-enabled health services.\n\nThe company has posted outstanding earnings over the past year and could be poised to have another stellar quarter when it announces results next month. This is one of the companies that have limited exposure to the public exchanges.\n\nUnitedHealth investors are paid a 1.3% dividend. UBS raised its price target from $131 to $135, while the mean target is $127.19. The shares closed Wednesday at $116.54.\n\nALSO READ: Why Deutsche Bank Says to Buy Gilead and Vertex Pullbacks\n\nWhile the big run in the top stocks may be over, investors can still feel good investing in what has been over the years a fairly defensive sector.
