For one of the Senate’s most vulnerable incumbents, Senator Mary Landrieu’s campaign site is rather . . . sparse right now.

The opening splash page is an invitation to contribute money — standard on campaign web pages these days — and then . . . three buttons: a link to the Facebook page, a link to the Twitter feed, and the “News & Press Releases” page.

In the 29 items listed on the “News & Press Releases” page, the words “Obamacare,” “Affordable Care Act,” “health care,” and “health” never appear.

“Insurance” gets mentioned six times . . . but only in the context of flood insurance.

She does announce that the “Telecommunications Development Fund (TDF) Foundation has awarded $30,000 to the City of Vidalia to deploy a wireless network throughout Vidalia’s 77-acre Municipal Park.” She also mentions her support for a bill to boost foreign adoptions, her push to ensure that Poverty Point, Louisiana, becomes a World Heritage Site, and her efforts to protect the federal Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund.

But no mention of Obamacare.
