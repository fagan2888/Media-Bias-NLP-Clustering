Meanwhile, the world changed as well, while wars in Afghanistan and Iraq sucked money from long-term weapons projects. Through it all, Pentagon officials maintained they would need exactly 2,443 combat F-35s, plus 14 development aircraft, to deter and fight potential adversaries such as China.\n\nBut now radical extremists are wreaking havoc across much of the Middle East and northern Africa, and Russia has re-emerged as a major foe. On Thursday morning, Gen. Joseph Dunford, the Marine Corps commandant nominated to become the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the F-35 buying plan is under review.\n\n\u201cGiven the evolving defense strategy and the latest Defense Planning Guidance, we are presently taking the newest strategic foundation and analyzing whether 2,443 aircraft is the correct number,\u201d Dunford wrote in response to questions asked by the committee in advance of his hearing Thursday. \u201cUntil the analysis is complete, we need to pursue the current scheduled quantity buy to preclude creating an overall near-term tactical fighter shortfall.\u201d\n\nDunford\u2019s comments come one week after Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the outgoing JCS chairman, warned in a new National Military Strategy that the military might need to rethink and reorganize for the hybrid wars of the future.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the F-35 \u2014 the largest weapons program ever, by many billions of dollars \u2014 is going away. \u201cWith projected adversarial threats challenging our current capabilities in coming years, the Joint Strike Fighter is a vital component of our effort to ensure the Joint Force maintains dominance in the air,\u201d Dunford wrote.\n\nThe entire program, both developing and buying the actual jets, is projected to cost $400 billion, while operating and maintaining those planes is projected to cost between $859 billion and $1 trillion. In addition to the 2,457 U.S. aircraft, allies are projected to purchase hundreds of F-35s.\n\nMany experts believed the Pentagon\u2019s vision of a fleet of 2,443 Lockheed Martin F-35s was a pipe dream \u2014 but also that the program was likely stable for at least 15 to 20 years of its planned three-decade procurement period.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody on Wall Street would be surprised if [the Defense Department] starts to back away from that number just because I don\u2019t think anybody really gave Lockheed Martin or the subcontractors on the program full credit for the total buy,\u201d Byron Callan, a defense analyst with Capital Alpha Partners said.\n\n\u201cThat said, we\u2019re still probably going to get to a build rate of 150 [aircraft] per year total, at least for the early part of the decade,\u201d he said. \u201cThen the real question is what happens beyond that.\u201d\n\nAfter years of cost increases and schedule slips, the F-35 project has largely stabilized over the past three years, according to defense officials. The Marine Corps version of the jet will soon be declare battle-ready. In the coming years, the Pentagon is planning to increase its annual orders of the aircraft.\n\nBut while the F-35 program stretched out year by year, other strategic national-security priorities began appearing. At the end of the next decade, the Air Force is planning to buy new long-range stealth bombers, while the Navy plans to buy an expensive replacement for the Ohio-class submarine.\n\n\u201cIf confirmed, I will advise the Secretary as he assesses the delicate balance of the capacity and the capabilities of the future Joint Force,\u201d Dunford wrote. \u201cThis advice will be informed by the extent to which the F-35 program conforms to the priority requirements identified by Combatant Commanders and the Department\u2019s strategic plans.\u201d\n\nWhile Dunford is the first senior-level defense official to acknowledge that the total F-35 buy could change, his comments are not likely to affect stocks or prompt companies to change their business plans, Callan said.\n\nLockheed shares were up $2.60 to $192.70 in late-day trading.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Marcus Weisgerber", "description": "Gen.
