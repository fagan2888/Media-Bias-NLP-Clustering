He faces $35 million in forfeiture of greedy profits and up to 25 years behind bars.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all. Hours before the contractor pleaded guilty, Navy Captain Daniel Dusek, former commander of an amphibious assault ship, admitted to having disclosed U.S. military secrets to Francis and his firm in exchange for prostitutes, cash and visits to luxury hotels in Hawaii, Hong Kong and the Philippines.\n\nThe scandal first broke wide open in the fall of 2013 when two other Navy commanders were arrested and charged with accepting bribes in return for millions of dollars\u2019 worth of government contracts, The Washington Post reported at that time. Francis, the head of Glenn Defense Marine Asia, a Singapore-based company that provides port services to U. S. ships and submarines in the Pacific, was arrested that September along with another executive in a sting operation in California in connection with the bribery case.\n\nRelated: Scandals Rampant Among Brass While Soldiers Die\n\nWhile profiteering and corruption have existed in U.S. defense spending, this decade-long case may rank as the most audacious in recent memory. Five Navy officials have pleaded guilty so far; prosecutors have indicated there may be more to follow.\n\n\u201cIt is astounding that Leonard Francis was able to purchase the integrity of the Navy officials by offering them meaningless material possessions and the satisfaction of selfish indulgences,\u201d said Laura Duffy, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of California, whose office headed up the investigation.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS\n\n\n\nThe Congressional Research Service recently said the U.S. has pumped $1.6 trillion into the Afghanistan and Iraq war efforts since 9/11 \u2013 suggesting there have been many other opportunities for contractors to game the system.
