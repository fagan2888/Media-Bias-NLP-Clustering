Your presidential run is likely done.\n\nBush may not yet have packed it in, but we might as well start shoveling dirt on his campaign. The chances he can overcome poll numbers consistently stuck in single digits, the baggage of his last name and his near-daily gaffes, are slim to none. To paraphrase a famous comedy bit, his presidential ambitions\u2019 metabolic processes are now history, they are off the twig, they have kicked the bucket, shuffled off this mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the bleedin\u2019 choir invisible. THIS IS AN EX-CAMPAIGN!\n\nNot that any of this will stop him from shambling forward through Iowa and New Hampshire like the most preppily-dressed zombie on \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d After all, zombies don\u2019t know they are dead until you drive a stake through their brains. No one has done that to the JEB! 2016 campaign yet. (Note to conservative readers: THIS IS A METAPHOR. I am in no way advocating actual, real violence against the person of Jeb Bush.) The GOP establishment is nervous but has not completely abandoned him yet. And he still has quite a bit of money on hand, thanks mostly to his super PAC.\n\nAll that said, the signs of a flailing, fading operation are everywhere. Bush\u2019s third-quarter fundraising haul was mediocre. Last week Politico published two stories examining the campaign\u2019s financial problems. Together they wove a tale of monetary woe for a candidate who was once expected to be the most formidable in the race: Bush has had to eschew private planes and fly commercial! He has had to stay in cheaper hotels! Some on his staff are taking pay cuts! (Recall that stories about slashed and eliminated salaries hit the Rick Perry campaign right before the former Texas governor dropped out of the race.)\n\nBush\u2019s backers are nervous. One of them complained to Politico \u2013 anonymously \u2013 that donors are not seeing much \u201cbang for their buck.\u201d A Republican political consultant, who also remained anonymous, likened Bush\u2019s predicament to the moment in \u201cPredator\u201d when Arnold Schwarzenegger says of the mysterious and wounded creature killing his team of soldiers, \u201cIf it bleeds, we can kill it.\u201d Inspiring stuff!\n\nAbove all, there is the inarticulateness that makes Jeb! Bush\u2019s father and brother sound like Cicero. His unartful comments on a handful of subjects suggest a man either saddled with a patrician\u2019s tin ear, or a guy trying on the persona of a hard-right Washington hater and failing miserably. Just in the last few weeks, he has dismissed the idea of enacting gun control laws to reduce mass shootings as worthless because \u201cstuff happens.\u201d He has accused African-American voters of only voting for candidates who will give them \u201cfree stuff.\u201d (Very big on the word \u201cstuff,\u201d is old Jeb.) Just the other day he suggested he\u2019d like to start a recession in Washington, D.C. because somehow that would grow the economy everywhere else.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Let's face it: Jeb sucks at this whole running-for-president thing, and he's just wasting our time now", "title": "Jeb Bush\u2019s epic implosion: Why it\u2019s high time he gave up his presidential fantasy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Let's face it: Jeb sucks at this whole running-for-president thing, and he's just wasting our time now", "title": "Jeb Bush\u2019s epic implosion: Why it\u2019s high time he gave up his presidential fantasy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/17/jeb_bushs_epic_implosion_why_its_high_time_he_gave_up_his_presidential_fantasy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/jeb_bush16.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Let's face it: Jeb sucks at this whole running-for-president thing, and he's just wasting our time now", "title": "Jeb Bush\u2019s epic implosion: Why it\u2019s high time he gave up his presidential fantasy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/jeb_bush16.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Gary Legum", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, 2016 Republican primary, Editor's Picks, Jeb Bush, Jennifer Rubin", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd030e\"", "article_summary": "Topics: 2016 Elections, 2016 Republican primary, Editor's Picks, Jeb Bush, Jennifer Rubin, Elections News, Politics NewsMemo to Jeb Bush: Ignore mash notes like this one from Jennifer Rubin.\nI am in no way advocating actual, real violence against the person of Jeb Bush.)\n2016 campaign yet.\nBush may not yet have packed it in, but we might as well start shoveling dirt on his campaign.\nJust the other day he suggested he\u2019d like to start a recession in Washington, D.C. because somehow that would grow the economy everywhere else."}
