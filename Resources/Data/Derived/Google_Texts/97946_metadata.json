Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, predicted doom for the fate of the Affordable Care Act, following the Supreme Court's ruling Thursday that upheld a key portion of the law.\n\n\"I just don't think this law is fixable,\" Ryan said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"I just think it's so fundamentally flawed. I think the law is going to collapse under its own weight.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling only ensured that Ryan was \"as motivated as ever before to repeal and replace this law and that's what we're working on,\" the congressman added.\n\nFollowing the 6-3 Supreme Court ruling, several Republicans vowed to repeal the law -- and some GOP contenders for the White House, including establishment favorite former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, have already started to raise funds off of the decision.\n\nRather than give up the ghost, Ryan said, \"as a practical matter, it means we need to win the 2016 election and with a Republican president in 2017.\" The goal moving forward is to \"replace this law with one that actually works, one that people actually like.\"\n\nThe Wisconsin Republican also blasted the Supreme Court for the decision, accusing them of \"rewriting laws\" from the judiciary branch.\n\n\"I think that they've done a great disservice to the country because they're rewriting laws at the bench,\" Ryan said. \"We have three constructionists on the court when we should have had five.\"\n\nThe Republican congressman leveled specific criticism at Chief Justice John Roberts, who he said was \"now counting foul balls as home runs.\"\n\n\"And so, yes, I'm very shocked at this ruling, but it does not deter us from actually delivering on what we really want, which is affordable care for everybody and let people choose what they want to buy,\" the Republican congressman added. \"And that's not what this law does.\"\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee chair said that a \"comprehensive replacement plan\" is in the works.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican leader and former VP candidate says that the GOP is still working on a &quot;comprehensive replacement&quot;", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-ryan-obamacare-will-collapse-under-its-own-weight/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/06/28/31526b90-a122-4b8a-a0ad-ca2cf578a535/thumbnail/1200x630/dc009d46f96d2df7ccb6b50665c2799c/ftnryan.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "The Republican leader and former VP candidate says that the GOP is still working on a \"comprehensive replacement\"", "title": "Paul Ryan: Obamacare will \"collapse under its own weight\""}, "twitter": {"description": "The Republican leader and former VP candidate says that the GOP is still working on a \"comprehensive replacement\"", "title": "Paul Ryan: Obamacare will \"collapse under its own weight\"", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/paul-ryan-obamacare-will-collapse-under-its-own-weight/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/paul-ryan-obamacare-will-collapse-under-its-own-weight/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-ryan-obamacare-will-collapse-under-its-own-weight/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@facethenation", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/06/28/31526b90-a122-4b8a-a0ad-ca2cf578a535/thumbnail/1200x630/dc009d46f96d2df7ccb6b50665c2799c/ftnryan.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-ryan-obamacare-will-collapse-under-its-own-weight/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/paul-ryan-obamacare-will-collapse-under-its-own-weight/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, obamacare supreme court, aca, supreme court, scotus, affordable health care", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FaceTheNation"}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, obamacare supreme court, aca, supreme court, scotus, affordable health care"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd13a5\"", "article_summary": "The Republican congressman leveled specific criticism at Chief Justice John Roberts, who he said was \"now counting foul balls as home runs.\"\nThe Wisconsin Republican also blasted the Supreme Court for the decision, accusing them of \"rewriting laws\" from the judiciary branch.\nI think the law is going to collapse under its own weight.\"\n\"I just don't think this law is fixable,\" Ryan said on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" Sunday.\nThe Supreme Court ruling only ensured that Ryan was \"as motivated as ever before to repeal and replace this law and that's what we're working on,\" the congressman added."}
