Conversely, 37 percent cited the rollout of the federal and state exchanges that serve as the centerpiece of President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act to be the biggest story of interest.\n\nThe economy in general tied with typhoon coverage in terms of importance among Americans.\n\nAdditionally, a lack of engagement in news stories on the matter was seen in all age groups, especially in younger adults throughout the United States.\n\n\u201cInterest has been particularly low among adults younger than 40, just 20 percent of whom have followed the aftermath in the Philippines last week, compared to the 47 percent who tracked news from Japan in 2011,\u201d a release on the study\u2019s findings noted.\n\nThe lack of interest could potentially take its toll on the rates at which Americans donate or otherwise contribute to relief efforts.\n\n\u201cIn the past, many have donated to relief causes after the first week,\u201d the release indicated. \u201cFor instance, after the earthquake in Haiti, far more said they donated in a survey conducted after 3-4 weeks (52 percent) than had said they donated in the first several days (18 percent).\u201d\n\nResearchers added, \u201cCurrently, in addition to the 14 percent who say they have already made a donation, another 17 percent say they plan to. But two-thirds (67 percent) say they do not think they will donate right now.\u201d\n\nIn addition to problems caused by a lack of interest in the United States, officials are also warning of scammers who are out to cheat generous donors who want to help survivors of the devastating typhoon in the Philippines.\n\nThe Department of Financial Institutions says legitimate relief organizations aren\u2019t the only ones asking for donations. Con artists are also preying on well-meaning donors.\n\nExperts noted that those who are eager to do good should forget the rummage sale clothes, the old toys and the kind of supplies that will only stack up undistributed or damage an already weakened economy, and should instead send cash donation to a respected charity.\n\nTyphoon Haiyan razed the eastern part of the Philippines on Nov. 8, killing thousands and leaving at least 600,000 homeless.\n\nThe team involved in the Pew Research Center study conducted interviews with 1,013 randomly selected American adults between Nov. 14 and Nov. 17 of this year.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2013 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
