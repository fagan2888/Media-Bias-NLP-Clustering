Gino CC BY-NC-ND 2.0\n\nThe story of the Fountain of Youth has been told for centuries, and people have searched tirelessly for its life-giving properties. Unfortunately, however, the Fountain of Youth isn\u2019t real. But, since we all want to live forever, what's the real key to living a long life? Is it eating healthy, avoiding drugs and tobacco, and exercising regularly? Is it in your genes and family history? Those things certainly have something to do with it. But maybe it\u2019s drinking a few brews every day for 70 years.\n\nAgnes Fenton has been enjoying at least three bottles of Miller High Life each day for the past 70 years. She said she started the ritual after her doctor told her that her only health problem was a benign tumor. Though her caregivers have made her cut back on the High Life \u2014 she also used to have a glass of whiskey a day \u2014 she doesn\u2019t believe that her drinking has been the key to her long life.\n\nWhen asked about how she figured out the key to living for a long time, she told ABC 7 News, \u201cAin't no secret, just keep in touch with God and do the right thing, that's all I know.\"\n\nRough estimates suggest Fenton and other supercentenarians make up one in 10 of the seven billion people on this planet. That\u2019s pretty good for a woman whose main drink of choice is the \u201cChampagne of Beers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "key, long, life, miller, high, life, champagne, beers, according, one, 110, year, old, woman", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A 110-year-old woman has been drinking the \"Champagne of Beers,\" Miller High Life, for the past few decades.
