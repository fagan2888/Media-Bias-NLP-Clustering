MSNBC’s newest liberal darling Ronan Farrow paid a visit to Comedy Central’s “The Colbert Report” on Tuesday night, and the daytime MSNBC host was hilariously mocked by the liberal comedian during the entire segment.

Throughout the interview, Colbert repeatedly poked fun at Farrow and his liberal MSNBC network, going so far as to tell his guest at age 26 “You could actually still be on your mother's health insurance thanks to ObamaCare.” [See video below.]

As the interview continued, Colbert laughed at the liberal culture of MSNBC and informed Farrow that, "They hire mostly at MSNBC to be shills for the left. Are you a shill for the left?” The Comedy Central host didn’t stop there and informd Farrow that his 1:00 p.m. show was designed to “to appeal to the youth demographic of people who are just waking up from not getting to their jobs.”

While the rest of the interview focused primarily on Farrow’s goals for the show, this brief back-and-forth exposed the hilarity of MSNBC hiring a 26 year old to host a daytime cable news show. Even though Colbert is actually a liberal, he beautifully pointed out how desperate MSNBC must be to hire a kid who could still be on ObamaCare to anchor one of its news shows.

However, despite his age, Farrow appears to be no different than his fellow liberals at MSNBC. In October of last year, the MSNBC praised how “The Clintons represent a style of honesty that the public craves right now.” In addition, In January Farrow disgustingly compared a war hero’s struggles to congressional bickering, commentary that should help him fit in nicely with the rest of the “Lean Forward” crew.
