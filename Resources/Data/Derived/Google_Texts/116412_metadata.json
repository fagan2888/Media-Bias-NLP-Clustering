The problem seems to be Card\u2019s exceedingly short memory.\n\nWithin three weeks of Obama\u2019s first inauguration, for example, Card went on television to complain that Obama had appeared in the Oval Office without a suit jacket , which Card insisted was proof of the president\u2019s insufficient \u201crespect\u201d for the office of the presidency. What he neglected to mention were all the photos of Reagan and Bush doing the same thing\n\nAfter Obama ordered the strike that killed Osama bin Laden, Card began whining again, complaining that the president \u201cpounded his chest a little too much.\u201d Perhaps Card forgot about the time his former boss put on a flight suit, landed on an aircraft carrier, and strutted his stuff under a \u201cMission: Accomplished\u201d banner \u2013 before the mission was, you know, accomplished.\n\nThis morning, Andy Card appeared on MSNBC and decided he wanted to talk about honesty\n\nThe man who served as chief of staff under former President George W. Bush and helped sell the Iraq War to the American people said Tuesday that President Barack Obama\u2019s entire team is guilty of misleading the public. Andy Card said that the current administration allowed Obama \u201cto mislead the American people for so long\u201d when he promoted the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe former White House chief of staff added, with a straight face, \u201cPresident Obama has lost the confidence of telling the truth to the American people.\u201d He didn\u2019t appear to be kidding.\n\nPeople can certainly draw their own conclusions about the president\u2019s track record of honesty; I think it\u2019s pretty easy to defend. For that matter, this notion that \u201cif you like your insurance you can keep it\u201d is somehow a devastating lie strikes me as pretty silly . At worst, it was an oversimplification of a complex issue, which does not a scandal make. (Besides, why would anyone like a terrible coverage plan that offers them no real security?)\n\nBut I\u2019d be eager to hear more from Card about presidents whose dishonesty leads to a loss of public confidence. He did, after all, work for the guy who told the world that Saddam Hussein not only had weapons of mass destruction, but had \u201crecently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.\u201d\n\nthree installments. Bush said ridiculously untrue things with alarming regularity . David Corn wrote a 320-page book on \u201cThe Lies of George W. Bush,\u201d and didn\u2019t even include the entirety of Bush\u2019s first term.
