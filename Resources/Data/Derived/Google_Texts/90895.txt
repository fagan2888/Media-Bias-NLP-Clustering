House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has suggested that comments made by Robert Gibbs about the Affordable Care Act were influenced by the former White House press secretary's current job.

Pelosi, on CNN's "State of the Union" show on Sunday slammed Gibbs for not looking at the successes of the ACA.

"I don't know who his clients are or what his perspective is. But we are celebrating the fact that we have over seven million who have signed up."

Gibbs, who is a founding partner of a strategic communications practice called The Incite Agency, said last week at a conference in Colorado that he did not expect the employer mandate portion of the Affordable Care Act to survive legal challenges.





The employer mandate requires companies with at least 50 employees to offer health insurance options. The mandate has been delayed twice already.

"I don’t think the employer mandate will go into effect," Gibbs said in a speech at the 2014 Benefits Selling Expo.

"It’s a small part of the law. I think it will be one of the first things to go."

The current press secretary, Jay Carney, answered Gibbs' comments Thursday, saying, "You can make predictions all the time and they turn out not to be true.

While Gibbs said he supports the law, he also said there was room for improvement.

“We need to have an honest discussion about improving and tweaking the law,” Gibbs said.
