(The Sports Xchange) - Arizona Diamondbacks first baseman Paul Goldschmidt, who is sidelined with a fractured left hand, is likely finished for the season, manager Kirk Gibson revealed Sunday.

The two-time All-Star was placed on the 15-day disabled list on Saturday, a day after he was struck by a fastball from Pittsburgh Pirates reliever Ernesto Frieri in the ninth inning of a 9-4 loss.

"Realistically, it's eight weeks," Gibson told reporters before Sunday's game. "So he's done."

Goldschmidt, 26, was having a solid follow-up season after finishing second in voting for the 2013 National League Most Valuable Player Award. He is hitting .300 with 19 homers and 69 RBIs, and he leads the majors with 39 doubles and 75 runs scored.

The Diamondbacks also acquired outfielder Blake Tekotte from the Chicago White Sox in exchange for cash considerations. Tekotte will report to Triple-A Reno.
