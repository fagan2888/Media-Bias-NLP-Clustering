We don\u2019t accept that everyone in a community must be under the gun because some of them committed crimes. Or, that journalists should be arrested while trying to cover that community. ... Stipulated that we ask cops to handle challenging, dangerous, delicate situations like riot and looting in Ferguson or manhunts in Boston. Because this is America, we ask them to do it while preserving the rights of innocent bystanders and even those who may be engaging in crime.\n\nPaul and Ham both noted that libertarians have been warning about excessive police tactics for some time now. They have a point. And I know quite a few liberals (starting with yours truly) who didn\u2019t pay enough attention at the time. One reason is the very real, very significant political differences between the two ideologies. The libertarians see overzealous police as symptomatic of overzealous government in general. Demilitarizing the cops, defunding the welfare state\u2014it\u2019s all part of one seamless governing agenda.\n\nBut Paul\u2019s comments got some attention from liberals like Congressman John Conyers of Michigan, ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. \u201cI\u2019m encouraged by that kind of observation,\u201d Conyers told Greg Sargent of the Washington Post, adding that he could imagine a liberal-libertarian alliance in favor of sentencing reform and other shared causes. \u201cWe hope for it\u2014and every now and then it happens.\u201d\n\n\u2014Jonathan Cohn\n\nThe news from yesterday:\n\nFERGUSON: Following nearly universal condemnations of police tactics, including statements from President Obama, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon handed security operations over to the state highway patrol. Nixon said Ferguson had become a \u201cwar zone,\u201d called the situation \u201cunacceptable,\u201d and promised a \u201cdifferent tone.\u201d Nixon also appointed Captain Ronald Johnson, an African-American who grew up in the area, to take command of the situation. Johnson began by scaling back the police presence, meeting and marching with the protesters, and vowing that police will respect their right to free assembly and expression.

Among other things, it will curb the use of \u201cclopening\u201d\u2014having employees close the store at night, then return early in the morning to open it. (New York Times)\n\nIMMIGRATION: With Obama weighing how far he can take executive action on immigration, Manu Raju and Seung Min Kim report that Senate Democrats aren\u2019t pushing the White House too hard. The reason? It could hurt some vulnerable Democrats seeking reelection in deeply conservative states.

Many liberals calling for an ambitious order say Obama can justify it by citing his broad powers of \u201cprosecutorial discretion.\u201d Danny thinks those liberals don\u2019t actually understand what the term means.
