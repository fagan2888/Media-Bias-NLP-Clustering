It\u2019s the third time in 40 years that the payout has stayed flat \u2014 but those three instances have all been since 2010. The news also means that some people who receive Social Security are going to see their Medicare premiums shoot up.\n\nThe size of Social Security checks is adjusted each year to keep pace with inflation, otherwise known as a cost of living adjustment or COLA. Inflation has been flat over the period Social Security measures, so payments will stay the same next year.\n\nRelated: Social Security Ruling Drives Up Medicare Costs for Millions\n\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about how your Social Security checks are adjusted from year to year.\n\nWhat is the COLA?\n\nIt\u2019s not a soft drink. The COLA is an adjustment made to benefits paid under Social Security and Supplemental Security Income, the disability program for low-income people, in order to factor in the effects of inflation. Congress enacted the COLA provision as part of the Social Security Amendments of 1972. Before that, any increases in Social Security had to be approved by Congress.\n\nThe adjustment now happens annually and is based on the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). If the CPI-W doesn\u2019t increase during the third quarter of the year compared with the same period the previous year, no adjustment is made to benefits.\n\nHow is the CPI-W determined?\n\nThe CPI-W is one version of the consumer price index, a measure of inflation tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Labor Department. It is based on the prices of \u201cfood, clothing, shelter, fuels, transportation fares, charges for doctors\u2019 and dentists\u2019 services, drugs and other goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living.\u201d The prices are gathered across 87 urban areas from 6,000 housing units and roughly 24,000 retailers, from supermarkets and gas stations to department stores and other places where Americans buy goods and services. Those prices are then weighted to reflect the importance of the items in the spending of the population group being considered.\n\nHas the COLA remained flat before? How big is it usually?\n\nTwice, in 2010 and 2011. From 2010 through 2015, the annual cost-of-living adjustment has averaged 1.4 percent a year, less than half of the 3 percent average during the prior decade, according to the Senior Citizens league. Including 2016, the annual COLA has averaged 2.26 percent a year over the last 20 years.\n\nSo the government is saying there\u2019s no inflation this year? How can that be?\n\nThe main factor pushing overall inflation down is gasoline prices, which have plummeted 30 percent since last year. Airfares and clothing prices have also fallen by 5.9 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, other prices have risen \u2014 but not by enough to offset the massive tumble of prices at the pump. Medical care is up by 2.4 percent, housing costs by 3.2 percent and food prices by 1.6 percent.\n\nThese price disparities have led some people to say that the government\u2019s measure of inflation doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the prices of the goods and services that the elderly use and that different variations should be used to determine the Social Security COLA.\n\nWhat are those other ways to measure inflation?\n\nAdvocates for the elderly or for expanding Social Security say the government should use a version called the Experimental Price Index for the Elderly, or CPI-E. This calculates the consumer price index for Americans 62 years of age and older, taking into account the difference in spending habits between workers and retirees. Retirees drive less, meaning the low gas prices don\u2019t affect them as much, and they spend more money on health care and long-term care, areas where prices have risen faster than inflation overall.\n\nOthers, including those concerned with the long-term cost of Social Security, also think the CPI-W should be replaced \u2014 but they argue the current index is too generous and doesn\u2019t reflect how people respond to changing prices in the real world, like switching to buy more chicken if beef prices jump. They favor the COLA being linked to a measure of inflation known as the chained CPI. This measurement would cause the rate at which benefits rise to be slower than if using the CPI-W, because it reflects the substitutions that consumers make in response to rising prices of certain goods.\n\nRelated: Is There a Less Painful Way to Fix Social Security?\n\nWhat if I don\u2019t get Social Security? Why should I care about any of this?\n\nEven if it doesn\u2019t affect you directly, Social Security and its annual adjustments are important to a huge portion of the U.S. population, meaning that they can carry some real economic significance. The COLA will affect benefits for more than 70 million people this year, which is more than one-fifth of the nation\u2019s population. Nearly 60 million retirees, disabled workers, spouses and children collect Social Security benefits. The COLA will also affect benefits for around 4 million disabled veterans, 2.5 million federal retirees and their survivors and more than 8 million people who receive Supplemental Security Income. And a flat COLA actually has some surprising implications for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nWait, what does this have to do with Medicare?\n\nSocial Security and Medicare are actually linked in a way that could result in a big jump in Medicare Part B premiums for some seniors unless Congress or the Department of Health and Human Services step in to prevent it.\n\nMost Medicare beneficiaries pay their Part B premiums, currently $104.90 a month, out of their Social Security benefits. Those premiums are expected to jump next year, meaning Social Security recipients would see their checks get smaller \u2014 except that the so-called \u201chold harmless\u201d provision in the Social Security law disallows an increase in Medicare premiums for 70 percent of Social Security recipients if their COLA is too small to cover the added cost. The rule prevents most people\u2019s Social Security payments from falling from one year to the next.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t apply to the remaining 30 percent of beneficiaries, though, meaning that they don\u2019t have any protection from the rise in premiums. This group is made up of 3.1 million seniors with above-average incomes, the 2.8 million people who will be new to Medicare next year, and 1.6 million Medicare beneficiaries who don\u2019t pay Part B through Social Security because they haven\u2019t started receiving their retirement benefits yet. Troublingly, most of these people are lower-income Medicare beneficiaries who claim both Medicare and Medicaid.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Social Security Administration officially", "title": "Social Security\u2019s COLA and Your Benefits, Explained", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/16/Social-Security-s-COLA-and-Your-Benefits-Explained", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02142011_socialsecurity_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/16/Social-Security-s-COLA-and-Your-Benefits-Explained", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02142011_socialsecurity_article.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Social Security Administration officially", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b03\"", "article_summary": "The Social Security Administration officially announced on Thursday what economists had expected: There will be no hike in Social Security benefits in 2016.\nRelated: Social Security Ruling Drives Up Medicare Costs for MillionsHere\u2019s everything you need to know about how your Social Security checks are adjusted from year to year.\nMost Medicare beneficiaries pay their Part B premiums, currently $104.90 a month, out of their Social Security benefits.\nThe news also means that some people who receive Social Security are going to see their Medicare premiums shoot up.\nNearly 60 million retirees, disabled workers, spouses and children collect Social Security benefits."}
