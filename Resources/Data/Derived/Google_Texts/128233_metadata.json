And two local Republican lawmakers also support asking voters to increase the state tax \u2014 which has remained constant at 22 cents for more than 20 years.\n\nThe support became evident at the Club 20 meeting Thursday in Grand Junction, where Gov. John Hickenlooper told leaders he would support them if Democrats and Republicans can agree on the plan.\n\n\u201cIf you got all the Republicans and all the Democrats and all the legislators unified in this, I\u2019d be happy to stand beside them,\u201d Hickenlooper said in an interview Friday. He said \u201cthat\u2019s the only way (it would) have a remote chance of passing.\u201d\n\nHickenlooper rebutted a report in the Colorado Statesman that stated the Democrat called for a 10- to 12-cent hike in the state gasoline tax to provide more money for road and bridge projects. \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t call for a gas tax hike,\u201d he said.\n\nChristian Reece, the Club 20 executive director, said her notes show the governor would support a gas tax increase, but she did not recall the governor assigning numbers to the proposal.\n\nRep. J. Paul Brown, an Ignacio Republican who attended the meeting, also said the governor said he would support the tax hike.\n\n\u201cThose guys are the ones who are pushing the gas tax so they shouldn\u2019t be trying to foist it off on me,\u201d Hickenlooper said sharply, referring to the lawmakers.\n\nWhat Hickenlooper prefers is a plan to reclassify the fee that hospitals pay to the state so that it wouldn\u2019t count toward the revenue ceiling set by the Taxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights.\n\nIf lawmakers agree, it would allow more than $200 million in road dollars to flow to projects for the foreseeable future, he said.\n\nAny tax hike would need voter approval under the state\u2019s Taxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights. But Brown and Rep. Yuelin Willet, R-Grand Junction, said a question about increasing the gas tax should go to the ballot.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s worth looking at an increased tax,\u201d said Rep. Yuelin Willet, R-Grand Junction, who cautioned he\u2019s not yet taking a position on the tax hike. \u201cWe are seeing a lot of deterioration on the Western Slope roads.\u201d\n\nJohn Frank: 303-954-2409, jfrank@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ByJohnFrank", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Gas tax hike gets new attention but Hickenlooper remains uncommitted", "title": "Gas tax hike gets new attention but Hickenlooper remains uncommitted", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/21/gas-tax-hike-gets-new-attention-but-hickenlooper-remains-uncommitted/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150821__hickenlooperp1-2.jpg", "height": 442}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150821__hickenlooperp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-21T19:04:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T13:38:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI certainly didn\u2019t call for a gas tax hike,\u201d he said.\nThe influential Club 20 civic organization is considering a resolution to endorse a gasoline tax hike after its transportation policy committee gave it preliminary approval.\nAny tax hike would need voter approval under the state\u2019s Taxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights.\nBut Brown and Rep.
