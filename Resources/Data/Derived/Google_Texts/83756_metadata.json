(REUTERS/Joe Skipper)\n\n4058025\n\nMissouri\u2019s legislature is considering legislation that will suspend insurers\u2019 state licenses if they accept federal subsidies for Obamacare health insurance premiums.\n\nRepublican state Sen. John Lamping filed the bill as \u201ca legislative way by which the state actually could push back\u201d against Obamacare, Lamping told St. Louis Today.\n\n\u201cClearly, in Missouri, there\u2019s a very strong sense that they don\u2019t want this law,\u201d Lamping said, according to St. Louis Today. And the senator\u2019s claims ring true: Missourians have remained staunchly against the Affordable Care Act since its passage.\n\nIn 2010, a solid 71 percent of Missouri voters opposed the mandate in a ballot measure. Again in 2012, 62 percent of voters chose against a state-based Obamacare exchange. Missouri is served by HealthCare.gov instead of a state agency.\n\nThe Obamacare coverage offered in Missouri has also been considerably unpopular. Just 4,124 Missouri residents have selected an insurance plan on HealthCare.gov \u2014 just 3.5 percent of the state\u2019s goal to enroll 118,000 Missourians.\n\nLamping adopted his legislation from language provided by Michael Cannon, director of health policy at the libertarian Cato Institute. Cannon\u2019s 2012 joint paper with Jonathan Adler of Case Western Reserve\u2019s law school argues that Obamacare\u2019s languages prohibits subsidies from going to states that don\u2019t choose to run their own exchange.\n\nCannon\u2019s argument has provided the basis of Halbig v. Sebelius, a case awaiting a decision from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. In Halbig, four individuals taxpayers and three business owners have sued the federal government in the person of Department of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius. They argue that the IRS is thwarting Congressional intent by going to states on the federal exchange and attempting both to tax employers and individuals and to issue subsidies to insurers.\n\nCannon has since worked to convince states to refuse to create their own exchange as a result. State Sen. Lamping has taken the legal argument to heart, and regardless of the circuit court\u2019s opinion, wants to keep Missouri insurers on what he believes to be the straight and narrow.\n\n\u201cThe IRS does not trump Congress,\u201d Cannon told The Daily Caller News Foundation. Lamping\u2019s bill is \u201can attempt to use the powers that have always resided with the state to prevent President Obama from imposing illegal taxes on Missouri employers.\u201d\n\nThe rationale for restricting subsidies for state exchanges? Cannon has argued that Congress kept subsidies for state-based exchanges alone as a carrot for states to build their own exchange.\n\nBecause Missouri opted out of running its own marketplace, Lamping and Cannon argue, the subsidies, and the taxes on employers and individuals that come with them, are illegal according to Obamacare.\n\nThe bill will help Missourians, Cannon told TheDCNF, because \u201cif the insurance company won\u2019t accept subsidies, there won\u2019t be any subsidies to trigger penalties against Missouri employers.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not Lamping\u2019s first try in getting the bill through Missouri\u2019s Senate. A spokesman for the senator told TheDCNF that he filed the bill for the first time last March, but it didn\u2019t make it through committee before the legislature adjourned in May.\n\nSen. Lamping is trying again in earnest this year. The legislature has just opened this week and Lamping has already filed his new version of the bill.\n\nMeanwhile, the success of Lamping\u2019s bill will be tied to the Halbig suit that\u2019s currently awaiting a decision by the D.C. Circuit Court. \u201cA final ruling in favor of the employers and individuals that are challenging the IRS\u2019s illegal taxes and subsidies,\u201d Cannon told TheDCNF, \u201cwould mean that the IRS couldn\u2019t issue those subsidies\u201d in the first place, a tacit win for Lamping\u2019s legislation.\n\nA final ruling in favor of the Obama administration\u2019s ability to issue subsidies on the federal Obamacare exchange, however, would make Lamping\u2019s bill \u201ca much harder argument to make,\u201d Cannon said.\n\nA spokesman for Lamping\u2019s office told TheDCNF that he expects the bill to be assigned to committee late this week and for it to receive a \u201clengthy hearing.\u201d\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter and Facebook\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
