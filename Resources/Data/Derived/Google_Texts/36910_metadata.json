Doctors and healthcare workers are pouring into the country from around the world, but care centers remain overwhelmed.\n\nMany doctors and nurses in the Ebola-stricken country have become ill with the virus, or quit out of fear they will be infected next, according to news reports. Sierra Leone and Guinea are also struggling to fight the disease.\n\nThe outbreak began in March and has since killed more than 4,500 people \u2014 mostly within the three West African countries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nThere is no known cure for the disease, which kills more than half of the people that it infects.\n\nThat has put pharmaceutical companies into overdrive as they work to develop a vaccine or cure.\n\nFive drugmakers or medical device companies have mentioned Ebola on lobbying disclosure forms, though most provided few details about their advocacy.\n\nSome of the companies appear to be arguing for a boost in public health funding. Others could be seeking to raise awareness of their products among policymakers.\n\nZimek, a company that makes a disinfecting mister, hired a lobbying team at Dentons US to hold \u201cdiscussions regarding preventing the spread of Ebola and other infectious diseases using Zimek\u2019s infection control and biohazard remediation misting technology.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Hemispherx Biopharma, which is developing a drug to help treat Ebola, announced on Monday that it has a \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d with the law and lobby giant Squire Patton Boggs.\n\nThere are also players with established lobbyists who reported working on Ebola in recent months.\n\nBioCryst Pharmaceuticals, which has contracts with Bay Bridge Strategies and a subcontract with Peck Madigan Jones, is developing an anti-viral medication to treat hemorrhagic viruses such as Ebola and Marburg.\n\nThe company already has won millions of dollars in federal money from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to \u201caccelerate the development of BCX4430 as a treatment for hemorrhagic fever viruses,\u201d BioCryst said in a September announcement.\n\nThe boutique lobby shop Tarplin, Downs & Young is representing Sarepta Therapeutics, which has an experimental Ebola drug that has fared well in preliminary lab tests. The Pentagon gave the company $200 million to fund the development of the drug, and others manufactured by the company, but the program fell victim to Defense Department cuts in 2012, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cWe have been communicating to all of the government agencies, the World Health Organization. ... We\u2019ve had people at the table at every substantive discussion around how to manage this Ebola outbreak and have educated everybody who\u2019s interested in learning about our technology and the drug we have available,\u201d Sarepta\u2019s CEO, Chris Garabedian, said on CNBC after a Liberian man in Dallas tested positive for the disease last month.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows we\u2019re here. They know the drug we have, and we\u2019re waiting for that call.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the medical diagnostic equipment manufacturer Welch Allyn, with the backing of Akin Gump lobbyists, reported lobbying on \u201cEbola funding.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. has committed $1 billion to a global fund to fight Ebola in West Africa.\n\nHowever, budgets for the CDC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have been trimmed in recent years, which critics argue has helped to exacerbate the Ebola crisis and made it more difficult to get under control.\n\nIn 2010, the CDC\u2019s budget totaled $6.5 billion, falling to $5.8 billion during fiscal 2014. Meanwhile, the NIH spent $30.6 during the same period, almost $1 billion less than its peak in 2010.\n\nCongressional Republicans say the agencies have more than enough money, pointing to a major increase in funds over the last two decades. In 2010, the NIH\u2019s budget stood at only $17 billion.\n\nPublic health advocates would like to see the NIH receive about $34 billion in its annual budget.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t dismantle the fire department because you don\u2019t have a fire there in 10 years,\u201d said Karen Goraleski, the executive director of American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. \u201cThat\u2019s what has happened in a continued reduction in funds for tropical disease research funding.\u201d\n\nThe trade group listed lobbying on Ebola-related issues through the firm Drinker Biddle & Reath.\n\nGoraleski said she\u2019s also troubled by the government-wide cuts in travel spending. Her group\u2019s conference on tropical medicine \u2014 which covers dengue fever, cholera, typhoid, malaria and Ebola \u2014 used to attract more than 200 CDC officials. Last year, she said, only 25 showed up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s concerning that the top U.S. federal agencies involved in these types of infectious diseases \u2014 as many as there need to be \u2014 are not able to attend,\u201d Goraleski said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Ebola lobby is spreading in Washington.", "description": "The Ebola lobby is spreading in Washington.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Megan R.
