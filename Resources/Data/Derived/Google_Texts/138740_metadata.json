He cites \u201ca lot of reports\u201d in resurrecting the Jack Welch \u201cChicago guys\u201d conspiracy theory of the September 2012 jobs report in this bizarre segment:\n\nSantelli acknowledges that the would-be scandal is not quite official yet, but blows right past any concerns about whether the allegations are factual or not and goes straight to the dark insinuations:\n\nThis is the beginning, and I\u2019m sure investigations will ensue, but it really does raise a very large question\u2026\n\n\n\nI had a sense that it didn\u2019t feel right. Jack Welch definitely had a sense that it didn\u2019t feel right. If we knew now what we knew then (sic).\n\nSantelli, who kicked off the Tea Party in 2009 with his rant about a minor proposed homeowner bailout, is edging into Glenn Beck territory here. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is not quite the Bunker of Doom, and Santelli uses a whiteboard instead of a chalkboard, but he\u2019s reporting from an alternate reality all the same.\n\nIn Santelli\u2019s telling, the combination of the IRS scandal (which turned out not to be a scandal), the \u201cyou can keep it\u201d Obamacare promise broken for a few percent of the country with crappy insurance, the false unemployment-conspiracy scandal, some incoherent ramblings about the Fed, and the administration fining JPMorgan $13 billion combine to mean Obama stole the election with dirty tricks.\n\nHe\u2019s painting a picture for ya, see, while stalking the camera::\n\nThough, unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t able to work in the Tides Foundation:\n\nBut Santelli\u2019s recommendations are Beckian:\n\nHow many times has Warren Buffet said, \u2018When you wake up in the morning, you\u2019re supposed to look at your positions and fall in love with them every day or get rid of them. Think about the logic to that\u2026\n\n\n\nAmerica, you really need to think about where we\u2019ve been and where we\u2019re going.\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about the logic of that, per Santelli\u2019s request, and best I can figure, he\u2019s calling for impeachment or for overthrow.\n\nThat\u2019s based on a bunch of disjointed ramblings about scandals that aren\u2019t scandals and a relatively minor broken political promise.\n\nNice, CNBC.\n\nRyan Chittum is a former Wall Street Journal reporter, and deputy editor of The Audit, CJR's business section.
