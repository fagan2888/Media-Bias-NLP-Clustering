Feb. 15 deadline to obtain 2015 coverage and avoid tax penalty

Editorial by BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York

There is an important Affordable Care Act deadline approaching and only 17 percent of uninsured individuals know when it is according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation Poll.

On Sunday, Feb. 15, most uninsured individuals will need to obtain coverage to avoid being subject to a tax penalty - at least 2 percent of their income. With this deadline quickly approaching, BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York continues efforts to ensure every member of the community has the adequate resources needed to simplify options and select the plan that best fits one's needs.

BlueCross BlueShield will offer enrollment events through the weekend. Taking place across Western New York, the events offer access to the Internet, a short overview of the NY State of Health Marketplace and face-to-face interaction with BlueCross BlueShield's licensed benefit consultants to answer questions and help through the enrollment process. Walk-ins are welcome or individuals can call 1-800-888-5407 to pre-register.

Schedule of enrollment events:

In addition, BlueCross BlueShield representatives continue to field questions and help individuals understand their options at eight Western New York Target retail stores. BlueCross BlueShield kiosks will be staffed by representatives of the health plan with computers and enrollment collateral this Thursday and Friday from 4-8 p.m.

Online enrollment remains the most popular channel for individuals looking to gain coverage. BlueCross BlueShield offers an intuitive shopping journey for individual exchange shoppers at www.ShopBluePlans.com. The website features a personal quote and subsidy calculator with a soft transfer over to the New York State of Health Marketplace to finalize the individual's selection.
