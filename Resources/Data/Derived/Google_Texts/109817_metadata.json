On Tuesday, the contract will be the topic of a discussion for the Legislature\u2019s Health and Human Services Committee, while the budget-writing Appropriations Committee expects to take up the contract and the status of the study on Thursday.\n\nThe Alexander Group, headed by Gary Alexander, was awarded the $925,000 contract by the state\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services to study Maine\u2019s welfare system, including the possible expansion of MaineCare, the state\u2019s Medicaid system. The contract calls for the group to issue a series of reports between December 2013 and May 2014.\n\nThe first part of that study on the Medicaid expansion had a target date of Dec. 1, but as of Monday, Dec. 9, the report had not been filed with DHHS, according to the department\u2019s spokesman, John Martins.\n\nMartins also said via email Monday that officials from DHHS would not be attending the committee meetings this week, despite being invited to do so.\n\nGary Alexander served as Pennsylvania\u2019s secretary of public welfare until February 2013, when he resigned to pursue opportunities in the private sector, according to the Associated Press.\n\nJust weeks after his resignation, Republican Gov. Tom Corbett\u2019s administration fired three other of the department\u2019s top officials.\n\nDuring and after his tenure, Alexander was an outspoken opponent of the proposed expansion of Medicaid under the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nA November report issued by Pennsylvania Auditor General Eugene DePasquale showed mismanagement of a portion of that state\u2019s Medicaid system by Alexander and his staff cost the state an estimated $7 million in increased costs.\n\nDePasquale said Monday he found Maine\u2019s decision to contract Alexander\u2019s company \u201camazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sitting here thinking, \u2018OK, what type of background check was done on this?'\u201d DePasquale said. \u201cCertainly nobody contacted the state of Pennsylvania about him. He left this state, we do this audit, it was well-documented this was a major problem and literally on the heels of our audit coming out, he was hired by Maine.\u201d\n\nDePasquale said nobody from Maine\u2019s DHHS made any attempt to check with his office on Alexander\u2019s tenure in a leadership role in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cThat is a record that should have been known prior to people hiring him,\u201d DePasquale said.\n\nRepublicans, however are dismissive of DePasquale\u2019s criticism, noting DePasquale is a liberal Democrat who won statewide election by a thin margin in 2012.\n\nAdrienne Bennett, the press secretary for Maine\u2019s Republican Gov. Paul LePage, declined comment on the issue Monday.\n\n\u201cHis interests only lie in pursuing a liberal agenda,\u201d a spokesman for LePage\u2019s re-election campaign said of DePasquale Monday via email.\n\nMeanwhile, Martins in his email message Monday said the contract for Alexander\u2019s company was awarded, \u201cbased on their unique qualifications and we followed the guidelines for this contract as provided by the Department of Administrative and Financial Services.\u201d\n\nMaine Democratic legislative leaders complained that LePage\u2019s administration and officials within the Department of Health and Human Services were avoiding addressing their concerns.\n\nState Rep. Peggy Rotundo, D-Lewiston, who co-chairs the Appropriations Committee, said even if Alexander\u2019s company had been vetted, the large price tag on the contract should have been disclosed. The contract was signed in September but not made public until November.\n\n\u201cThe awarding of a no-bid contract that uses taxpayer dollars is terrible management and not worthy of the trust of the people of Maine,\u201d Rotundo said. \u201cIt\u2019s very disturbing.\u201d\n\nRotundo, a long-serving member of the Appropriations Committee, said she could not recall if any other governor, Democratic or otherwise, had ever awarded a no-bid contract for that much money.\n\n\u201cIn those years that I\u2019ve been on Appropriations, I do not recall anyone raising a concern about a $1 million contract going to a political buddy of the governor\u2019s,\u201d Rotundo said. \u201cI think had that been the case somebody would have raised that as an issue.\u201d\n\nRotundo called the Alexander Group contract the latest example of mismanagement within DHHS.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a track record here of mismanagement,\u201d Rotundo said. She said the contract, safety problems at the state-operated Riverview Psychiatric Center and ongoing difficulties resulting from LePage administration changes to the state\u2019s nonemergency ride program for MaineCare patients were all stacking up.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s deeply concerning to us,\u201d Rotundo said. \u201cIt\u2019s very troubling and the people of Maine should be very troubled.\u201d\n\nState Sen. Margaret Craven, D-Lewiston, the co-chairwoman of the Legislature\u2019s Health and Human Service Committee, said her committee would be discussing the same issues Tuesday. She also attacked the LePage administration\u2019s mismanagement of state resources and accused him of cronyism.\n\n\u201cFor the price of Gov. LePage\u2019s tea party crony, the state could have hired 23 people at Riverview \u2014 and we\u2019d be one step closer toward getting recertified and [recouping] the $20 million we\u2019ve already lost,\u201d Craven said in a prepared statement. \u201cDecisions like these do nothing to help the people of Maine or the financial health of our state.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 Pennsylvania\u2019s auditor general said Monday that he doubts how well the Maine Department of Health and Human Services vetted a company that it awarded a nearly $1 million no-bid contract to in September.
