You have to vet these people.\u201d\n\nThe employees will need to undergo checks, and some will require security clearances, which is an even longer process.\n\nMr. Palinkas said the large scale of the hiring and the new office space suggests to him that the White House had its plans in place for some time ahead of Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement last month.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so orchestrated it\u2019s pathetic,\u201d he said.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican who has taken the lead in fighting Mr. Obama\u2019s policy, said the new facility in Virginia is \u201ca clear symbol of the president\u2019s defiance of the American people, their laws and their constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is hiring federal employees to carry out a directive that violates the laws Congress has passed in order to foist on the nation laws Congress has repeatedly refused to pass,\u201d Mr. Sessions said in a statement.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s program envisions nearly 5 million illegal immigrants would be eligible for \u201cdeferred action,\u201d which entails a proactive promise that they won\u2019t be deported, a work permit to allow them to compete for jobs and the ability to get driver\u2019s licenses in most states.\n\nThe White House says the program is a recognition of the reality that most of those illegal immigrants won\u2019t ever be deported, and carving them out officially will leave immigration agents free to go after the few serious criminals among the illegal immigrant population.\n\nLouis D. Crocetti Jr., who used to run USCIS\u2019s fraud unit until he retired in 2011, said for the agency to properly ramp up its new policy, hire and train staff would take about a year. That\u2019s far longer than the time frame the Obama administration has talked about.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how they could possibly recruit, hire, screen, go through all the national security background checks and train everyone within six months,\u201d said Mr. Crocetti, who is now principal at the Immigration Integrity group. \u201cThat would be a very, very steep challenge, one that could only result in consequences of poorly trained staff.\u201d\n\nMr. Crocetti said fraud will be a major problem for the new amnesty \u2014 though just how big is anyone\u2019s guess, because the administration has turned a blind eye to those warnings, he said.\n\nHe said the administration had a chance to test out its policies with the 2012 deportation amnesty Mr. Obama announced for so-called dreamers, of which more than 600,000 have been granted.\n\nThat program, known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, has an approval rate of more than 95 percent \u2014 an astronomically high percentage for an immigration benefit, according to analysts.\n\nBut Mr. Crocetti said the administration has declined to do the kinds of compliance or fraud checks that would determine whether bogus applications are being approved.\n\n\u201cThe DACA was a golden opportunity for CIS to build this thing and get it right and iron out the wrinkles and be prepared for that one-day large amnesty program, which is inevitable \u2014 and they didn\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t address the fraud.\u201d\n\nHe said part of the problem is the very mission of USCIS, which is tasked with doling out immigration benefits. Senior officials at the agency judge it based on approvals, so it\u2019s \u201cnot helpful\u201d if the fraud detection unit comes out with assessments showing problems in some immigration programs.\n\n\u201cThere is an internal conflict of interest where you\u2019ve got a benefit agency that has to give the benefits to the people, but at the same time they\u2019re vulnerable if they start showing how much fraud there is, because what about the fraud they\u2019re not catching?\u201d he said.\n\nHe said it\u2019s been \u201cyears\u201d since a fraud assessment was completed. He recalled one fight with senior officials during his time at the agency when he detected a 21 percent fraud rate in immigration petitions related to marriage \u2014 only to see higher-ups question his methodology, scuttling the report\u2019s release.\n\nOn Tuesday, while testifying to Congress, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson acknowledged that fraud was a concern.\n\n\u201cFraudulent applications have the potential to undermine the whole process,\u201d he told the House Committee on Homeland Security. \u201cIn the planning for the implementation, I want to be sure that we take a hard look at best practices to avoid fraudulent applications, fraudulent misuse of the program. That\u2019s a priority of mine.\u201d\n\nOf the 1,000 new jobs USCIS has advertised for, seven are designated as part of the fraud-detection unit. Their pay ranges from $75,621 a year to $138,136 a year, according to the job postings.\n\nImmigration services officers fresh out of school are slated to make as little as $34,415, while top-level supervisors will make up to $157,100 a year. The postings said there are \u201cmany vacancies\u201d for those high-level jobs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Department of Homeland Security officials wasted little time in ramping up for President Obama's amnesty, posting 1,000 job openings the day after his announcement and announcing it already has space for hundreds of employees at a new location in Arlington, Virginia \u2014 an indication that it had laid its plans well before Mr. Obama's announcement.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Department of Homeland Security officials wasted little time in ramping up for President Obama\u2019s amnesty, posting 1,000 job openings the day after his announcement and announcing it already has space for hundreds of employees at a new location in Arlington, Virginia \u2014 an indication that it had laid its plans well before Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement.", "title": "DHS already hiring 1,000 employees to carry out Obama amnesty", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/3/dhs-hiring-1000-employees-carry-out-obama-amnesty/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/25/obama-immigrationjpeg-0107f.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/25/obama-immigrationjpeg-0107f.jpg", "description": "Department of Homeland Security officials wasted little time in ramping up for President Obama's amnesty, posting 1,000 job openings the day after his announcement and announcing it already has space", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "DHS already hiring 1,000 employees to carry out Obama amnesty"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Social Issues, Ken Palinkas, Louis D Crocetti Jr"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9c90\"", "article_summary": "He said the administration had a chance to test out its policies with the 2012 deportation amnesty Mr. Obama announced for so-called dreamers, of which more than 600,000 have been granted.\nMr. Palinkas said the large scale of the hiring and the new office space suggests to him that the White House had its plans in place for some time ahead of Mr. Obama\u2019s announcement last month.\nThat\u2019s a priority of mine.\u201dOf the 1,000 new jobs USCIS has advertised for, seven are designated as part of the fraud-detection unit.\nYou have to vet these people.\u201dThe employees will need to undergo checks, and some will require security clearances, which is an even longer process.\n\u201cIncreasing staffing will ensure that every case received by USCIS receives a thorough review under our guidelines,\u201d the agency said late Wednesday."}
