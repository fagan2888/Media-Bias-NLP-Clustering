And he thinks the 2014 midterm election should be personal for every member of his generation.\n\n\u201cMy generation doesn\u2019t feel like our political system represents them or responds to them in any way,\u201d the 34-year-old said. \u201cThat\u2019s very dangerous. We have to find a way to change that.\u201d\n\nCurbelo, who is looking to replace U.S. Rep. Joe Garcia in Florida\u2019s 26th Congressional District, hasn\u2019t always wanted to be a politician. But after his first daughter was born in 2009, he realized that he needed to get involved in the decision making process.\n\nHe was elected to serve on the Miami Dade County School Board the following year.\n\n\u201cI started thinking about the future, about her future,\u201d he said.\n\nIt was that same reasoning that led Curbelo to a congressional run.\n\n\u201cOver the last few years I have heard a lot of D.C. politicians talk about how they are worried about their children and grandchildren,\u201d he said. \u201cI realized they were talking about me and about my daughter\u2019s generation. If they are so worried about us, I think it is important for us to be at the table as some of these big decisions get made in our country.\u201d\n\nBut if elected, Curbelo promises that he won\u2019t just be heading to the Capitol to sit at the proverbial table. He wants to shake up the current structure. In a phone interview with Red Alert Politics, Curbelo highlighted some of the major changes he would like to see come about during his tenure.\n\nHe specifically called out the language in Obamacare that defines a full-time employee as anyone working 30 or more hours a week. He said this has created an incentive for companies to reduce people\u2019s hours to 29 or less.\n\nCurbelo said this policy reminds him of his dad, a Cuban immigrant that came to America in the 1960s.\n\n\u201cWhen my dad arrived in this country as an immigrant, he didn\u2019t want to work 30 or 40 hours. He wanted to work 80 hours, because that is what he needed to do in order to be able to get on his feet and to take care of his little brother,\u201d he said. \u201cPolicies like the 30-hour work week hurt people like my dad and other hourly workers that want to provide a better life for their families.\u201d\n\nThe current tax structure also penalizes these workers, he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to reform our tax system so it rewards hard work and not special interest. I\u2019m for closing tax loopholes that are basically corporate welfare and reducing the marginal tax rates for all Americans and the corporate tax rate,\u201d Curbelo said. \u201cI believe if we reconfigure our tax rate, we can achieve all that. That is going to lead to job growth and better jobs.\u201d\n\nCurbelo admits that changing the tax system will be hard and \u201cnot very popular,\u201d but he said fixing it will start to help a slew of other issues facing the country.\n\nOne of the problems that Curbelo believes can be alleviated in part through this reform is the student loan crisis.\n\n\u201cI think we have to take a broad perspective and think, \u2018What reforms does our government have to enact that will allow the economy to grow and to create the quality jobs that college graduates would like to have?\u2019\u201d Curbelo said. \u201cThat\u2019s why this has become a crisis. If people had good salaries and could pay their debt, we wouldn\u2019t have a crisis. What is happening is very sad. We have made a promise to young people in this country for decades now that if they work hard in high school and get good grades, then go to college and get a four-year degree, they are going to have a quality job. That\u2019s not true anymore.\u201d\n\nThe other step Curbelo said the government can take to help with the high levels of student loan debt is to create a \u201crigorous accountability system\u201d for higher education institution.\n\n\u201cWe pump billions of dollars into higher education institutions in this country every year, and these institutions, many of them, are not transparent with their students. We should hold colleges and universities accountable for the public funds they receive. Where is this money going to? Is it going to the massive education bureaucracy? Is it going into pensions? Or is it going to educate students and then to help them find jobs after college?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201c\u2026These aren\u2019t easy issues, but it\u2019s time for Washington to take on some of these tough issues and stop applying Band-aids to major problems. We have a patient that needs surgery and we apply Band-aids. That is not going to work in the long term.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Image via Facebook In the weeks leading up to the 2014 midterm elections, Red Alert Politics will be profiling select candidates that are either a part of the so-called millennial generation or have a strong connection and inclination toward policies that will primarily impact Gen Y.
