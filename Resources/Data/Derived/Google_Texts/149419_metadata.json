Two of its leaders and several fighters were captured shortly after crossing from Turkey into Syria in July by the Al Nusra Front (ANF), a Syrian rebel group affiliated with al Qaeda. The rest of the U.S.-backed fighters were later returned to Turkey.\n\nCook admitted DOD has trouble keeping track of where its handful of trainees have gone and what they\u2019re up to.\n\n\"We have concerns about the disposition of all these individuals, all these trainees,\" he said. \"I can't say with specificity where they have each ended up from this podium.\"\n\nCook also couldn\u2019t say how much of the allocated $500 million had been spent on the training program to date or how much a potential overhaul might cost.\n\nRelated: More Than 5,000 Airstrikes and ISIS Is as Strong as Ever\n\nHe said trainees in the second class \u201care still going through\u201d the roughly six to seven week course and that there is a third cohort but didn\u2019t say where their progress stood.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "After spending millions of dollars over the last nine months to churn out only 54 recr", "title": "DOD May Be Throwing Good Money After Bad on Syrian Training Program", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/09/DOD-May-Be-Throwing-Good-Money-After-Bad-Syrian-Training-Program", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/syria-crisis-town_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/09/DOD-May-Be-Throwing-Good-Money-After-Bad-Syrian-Training-Program", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/syria-crisis-town_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "After spending millions of dollars over the last nine months to churn out only 54 recr", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Cook admitted DOD has trouble keeping track of where its handful of trainees have gone and what they\u2019re up to.\n\u201cHard questions are being asked about this program,\u201d and how to make it more effective, Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said during a press briefing.\nCook also couldn\u2019t say how much of the allocated $500 million had been spent on the training program to date or how much a potential overhaul might cost.\nThe idea behind the program was for moderate rebels to serve as the ground forces against ISIS fighters in Syria, so the U.S. from having to commit boots on the ground, a major redline for President Obama.\n\"We have concerns about the disposition of all these individuals, all these trainees,\" he said."}
