A dead-of-night vote on an important SGR package would not have allowed time for ample consideration of ways to improve the bill.\n\n\u201cAlthough the SGR patch expires on March 31, 2015, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) typically holds Medicare reimbursement claims for 10 additional business days. This additional time period will ensure that holding a full Senate vote after the spring recess will not disrupt Medicare reimbursements.\n\n\u201cWhile AARP applauds the bipartisan effort thus far to repeal and replace the flawed SGR formula, we remain concerned that Medicare beneficiaries are unfairly shouldering more than their fair share of the cost of the SGR \u201cDoc Fix.\u201d AARP is prepared to work with the Senate to improve H.R. 2 for seniors.\n\n# # #", "article_metadata": {"DivisionMain": "Division:Press Center", "Division1": "Division:Press Center", "page_title": "AARP Backs Senate Taking Time to Deliberate Before Final Medicare SGR Reform Bill Vote", "estimated_publish_date": "2016-01-29", "Last-Modified": "2015-03-27T14:24:11.039-04:00", "keywords": "SGR, Medicare, AARP, Senate", "paywallStatus": "off", "livefyreId": "350119:http://www.aarp.org/about-aarp/press-center/info-03-2015/aarp-backs-senate-medicare-sgr-reform-bill.html", "lfdataConfig": "{\"globalConfig\":{\"network\":\"aarp.fyre.co\"},\"livefyreConfig\":[{\"collectionMeta\":\"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.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.UJyxzkmIyeISjnX6ZXtsq-mzFRuBVRZY847h1xphIzI\",\"checksum\":\"112c09f8ea55d2986fe76ad88575dbf1\",\"siteId\":\"350139\",\"articleId\":\"http://www.aarp.org/about-aarp/press-center/info-03-2015/aarp-backs-senate-medicare-sgr-reform-bill.html\",\"el\":\"livefyreConversation\",\"disableAvatars\":true,\"postToButtons\":[\"tw\",\"fb\"]}]}", "source": "aarp_press_center", "type": "info", "description": "AARP\u2019s Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond released the following statement that backs the Senate\u2019s decision to deliberate on a final Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR)", "robots": "index,follow", "Subject1": "DCSubjects:Health", "fb": {"app_id": 114175878660191}, "language": "english", "og": {"site_name": "AARP", "description": "AARP\u2019s Executive Vice President Nancy LeaMond released the following statement that backs the Senate\u2019s decision to deliberate on a final Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR)", "title": "AARP Backs Senate Taking Time to Deliberate Before Final Medicare SGR Reform Bill Vote", "url": "http://www.aarp.org/about-aarp/press-center/info-03-2015/aarp-backs-senate-medicare-sgr-reform-bill.html", "image": "http://cdn.aarp.net/etc/aarp/statics/global/img/logos/aarp_50x50.imgcache.rev1463067054884.png", "type": "article"}, "contentId": "/content/aarp/en/home/about-aarp/press-center/info-03-2015/aarp-backs-senate-medicare-sgr-reform-bill", "mcafeesecure-site-verification": "fa79d1a3c2770869e1286a81816d01a4", "IALevel1": "about-aarp", "IALevel2": "press-center", "s43": "PressCenter|Membership", "action": "read", "dateToday": "2016-05-26"}, "article_summary": "This additional time period will ensure that holding a full Senate vote after the spring recess will not disrupt Medicare reimbursements.\nA dead-of-night vote on an important SGR package would not have allowed time for ample consideration of ways to improve the bill.\n\u201cAlthough the SGR patch expires on March 31, 2015, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) typically holds Medicare reimbursement claims for 10 additional business days.\n\u201cWhile AARP applauds the bipartisan effort thus far to repeal and replace the flawed SGR formula, we remain concerned that Medicare beneficiaries are unfairly shouldering more than their fair share of the cost of the SGR \u201cDoc Fix.\u201d AARP is prepared to work with the Senate to improve H.R.\n2) and waiting until Congress returns from recess in two weeks."}
