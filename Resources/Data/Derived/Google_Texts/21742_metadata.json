The Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, requires every plan that covers elective abortions to collect a separate fee used exclusively to pay for those abortions. That requirement was the government\u2019s attempt to prevent tax dollars, as Obama promised, from directly funding abortion.\n\nThe GAO report found that many insurers were failing to collect from policyholders the required separate payment for abortion coverage.\n\n\u201cThe severe lack of transparency in Obamacare plans continues to leave many consumers unaware that they could be signing up for a plan that includes abortion coverage,\u201d said Sarah Torre, a policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation who closely follows the issue of Obamacare and abortion. Torre added:\n\nWorse, the health care law requires that insurance companies offering elective abortion coverage collect a separate premium of at least $12 a year from individuals to cover the procedures. No one should be forced to pay a hidden surcharge that\u2019s used to pay for others\u2019 abortions.\n\n>>> Commentary: Forcing Individuals and Taxpayers to Fund Elective Abortion Coverage\n\nAfter the Bracys\u2019 insurance company dropped them from their private plan, they discovered that Connecticut offered no health insurance options for citizens who object to paying for abortions, forcing them to violate their pro-life, religious beliefs.\n\nAlthough Connecticut added plans acceptable to the Bracys to its online insurance marketplace under Obamacare, four other states highlighted in the GAO report have yet to offer plans that don\u2019t include abortion coverage. That leaves pro-life families in Rhode Island, New Jersey, Vermont and Hawaii to face situations similar to that of the Bracys.\n\nThe Bracys, who are Catholic, see themselves as an example of Americans who feel deceived by Obama, who back in 2009 promised: \u201c[U]nder our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions.\u201d\n\nBarth Bracy works as executive director of Rhode Island Right to Life, a 45-minute commute from the family\u2019s home in Dayville, Conn.\n\nHe met his wife Abbie during a 15-year stint in the Philippines as a missionary. Today he serves as a deacon at the family\u2019s local church.\n\n\u201cGod is the center of our individual and family lives,\u201d Bracy told The Daily Signal in an earlier interview regarding the family\u2019s pro-life views and opposition to the abortion surcharge.\n\n>>> Family of Six Says They\u2019ll Go Uninsured Before Paying Obamacare\u2019s \u2018Abortion Fee\u2019\n\nTo truly protect individuals and families, Heritage\u2019s Torre said, Congress should repeal Obamacare and move forward with \u201creal health care reform.\u201d She said:\n\nAmericans deserve a health care system that increases access, decreases costs and allows individuals and families to choose health care without subsidizing life-ending procedures.\n\nTo address remaining issues of transparency in Obamacare\u2019s 2015 open enrollment period, which began Nov. 15, the Family Research Council teamed up with the Charlotte Lozier Institute to make information about abortion coverage clearly available in this state-by-state map.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A pro-life family won\u2019t be forced by Obamacare to pay for others\u2019 abortions through a \u201csecret fee\u201d after all.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A pro-life family won\u2019t be forced by Obamacare to pay for others\u2019 abortions through a \u201csecret fee\u201d after all.", "title": "Family Gets Relief From Obamacare\u2019s Mandatory \u2018Abortion Fee\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/BracyLetter1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-24T19:52:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1AIDtLY"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A pro-life family won\u2019t be forced by Obamacare to pay for others\u2019 abortions through a \u201csecret fee\u201d after all.", "title": "Family Gets Relief From Obamacare\u2019s Mandatory \u2018Abortion Fee\u2019", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/BracyLetter1.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "obamacare,Protecting Life,religious freedom", "published_time": "2014-11-24T14:59:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-24T19:52:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "abortion fee, obamacare, affordable care act, obamacare abortion fee, bracy, alliance defending freedom"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd945f\"", "article_summary": "A pro-life family won\u2019t be forced by Obamacare to pay for others\u2019 abortions through a \u201csecret fee\u201d after all.\nThat \u201csecret fee\u201d was uncovered in a Sept. 15 report by the Government Accountability Office, which found that more than 1,000 Obamacare plans cover abortion while remaining eligible for tax subsidies.\n>>> Commentary: How Obamacare Forces You to Subsidize Plans That Cover Elective AbortionFederal law forbids taxpayer subsidies for elective abortions.\nBarth and Abbie Bracy, who have four children, filed a lawsuit earlier this year against government officials, arguing that they failed to offer health insurance plans that didn\u2019t cover elective abortions.\nThe Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, requires every plan that covers elective abortions to collect a separate fee used exclusively to pay for those abortions."}
