There had apparently been some miscommunication when he signed up for his new health insurance in early December and his out-of-network deductible is tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nWhen the Knoxville-based Community Health Alliance closed at the end of December, around 27,000 Tennesseans had to search for new health insurance. The CHA was the state\u2019s first health co-op, part of the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare.\n\nJohn Vickers, diagnosed with stage three colon cancer last year, was enrolled with CHA. When he signed up with a different company in December, he believed his new plan would cover his expenses, but he found out in January that\u2019s not the case.\n\nThe former school bus driver and over-the-road tractor trailer driver was treated at Ft. Sanders Regional Medical Center and the Thompson Cancer Survival Center. At the time, his insurance was with the CHA. Vickers says when it came time for surgery in mid-November, his insurance paid for his care.\n\nEverybody except for my primary care physician was in-network. Everything was perfect. I was relieved. I felt good. Everything was going to happen the way it should,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen CHA announced it was closing in October, Vickers and thousands of others had to look for new health insurance on the Health Exchange Marketplace. He chose United Healthcare because it fit in with his present treatment. He was told Ft. Sanders was in network, as was Thompson Cancer Survival Center and his surgeon.\n\nThen, on January 1, Vickers got sick and ended up at Ft. Sanders for three days. As he checked out, Vickers got the bad news that Ft. Sanders was no longer in-network.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure that three day stay in the hospital is going to be expensive. I\u2019ve got a $50,000 copay to meet,\u201d he said.\n\nVickers was scheduled to begin a second round of low dose chemo the day WATE 6 On Your Side visited.\n\n\u201cThey called me yesterday saying they can\u2019t get the paperwork done, it could be another month,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody messed up. I hate to think it was me. I just took them at what they put before me which was everything was in network. That\u2019s why I picked that insurance.\u201d\n\nOver the last few weeks, Thompson Cancer Center and Vickers\u2019 surgeon appealed his situation to United Healthcare. Then came the harsh facts.\n\n\u201cI just told them this is urgent, this needs to be decided quick. They said, \u2018We do not have an urgent protocol. You just go in line like everybody else,'\u201d said Vickers.\n\nTwo weeks after our initial interview, Vickers returned to Thompson Cancer Center after being given a special GAP waiver.\n\n\u201cA GAP extension is where they treat me as if I am in network when actually I am out of network,\u201d said Vickers.\n\nHis renewed chemotherapy treatment began January 26. Initially, he was told his treatment would be considered in-network, but then as he checked out of the cancer center, just like in January, things changed as they told him he is not covered. Vickers says he is back to square one, but will continue his treatment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to have to pay for it. I\u2019m going to owe about $25,000,\u201d he said.\n\nThompson Cancer Center called Vickers on Monday saying they will try to find another provider. For now, his chemotherapy sessions are on hold and he\u2019s scrambling to find someone to help him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Knoxville man who has cancer is not sure if he'll be able to continue his chemotherapy treatments.
