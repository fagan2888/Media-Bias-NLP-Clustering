Every year, he would visit different parts of the Eastern Plains. When Allard was elected to the U.S. Senate, and Republican Bob Schaffer took his seat in the U.S. House, it became the Schaffer wheat tour. Then it was the Musgrave wheat tour after Republican Marilyn Musgrave; the Markey wheat tour after Democrat Betsy Markey; and then the Gardner wheat tour.\n\nWhen Gardner was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2014, Weld County District Attorney Ken Buck took his seat in Congress.\n\n\u201cSo now they have the \u2018Buck Wheat\u2019 tour,\u201d Gardner said, cracking himself and others up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m amazed he\u2019s managed to get a laugh out of that joke all day,\u201d Bennet said.\n\nAnd so it was as the unlikely duo told jokes and answered serious questions on water, wind, transportation and other issues Saturday on their tour. Gardner wanted to continue the tour after he was elected to the Senate and asked to have Bennet included, a gesture Bennet raved about. The bus trip was arranged by the Colorado Association of Wheat Growers.\n\nAs the bus rolled down the roads, Gardner had a confession.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell Greg Brophy I said this but I think Wray is pretty,\u201d Gardner said, referring to the former state senator who hails from nearby Wray.\n\nAccompanying them on the tour was Colorado\u2019s new agriculture commissioner, Don Brown who, like Gardner, also is from Yuma. Brown said he\u2019s still amazed that Gov. John Hickenlooper, a Democrat, didn\u2019t care that he was a Republican, just that he was a farmer and a rancher.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people ask me how can you work for a Democrat?\u201d Brown said. \u201cI told them, \u2018Well, one of my favorite people is a Democrat. My mother.'\u201d\n\nBrown and Bennet both share the distinction of having called Hickenlooper \u201cboss.\u201d Bennet served as Hickenlooper\u2019s first chief of staff when Hickenlooper was elected mayor of Denver in 2003.\n\nTwo state lawmakers, Republicans Rep. Jon Becker and Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg, bookended the wheat tour.\n\nBecker spoke at the opening event, at a restaurant in his home town in Fort Morgan. Becker noted when he was first elected to the statehouse, in 2010, he was elected to House District 63, the seat held by Gardner, who had successfully run for Congress that year.\n\n\u201cHow would you like to follow this guy?\u201d Becker said to laughter.\n\nBut legislative boundaries were redrawn after that and Becker was drawn out of his district and into Sonnenberg\u2019s House District 65. Becker stayed out for two years, and when Sonnenberg ran for the Senate last year, Becker ran for Sonnenberg\u2019s House seat.\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m following after Jerry Sonnenberg so I\u2019m doing fine,\u201d Becker said. Gardner exploded in laughter.\n\nSonnenberg, of Sterling, did one of his trademark laughs when he heard of Becker\u2019s comments. Sonnenberg spoke at the final event, a tour of the Anderson wheat farms in Haxtun. (You know you\u2019re in God\u2019s country when the program calls the evening meal \u201csupper\u201d instead of dinner.)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Betsy Markey,Bob Schaffer,Colorado Association of Wheat Growers,Cory Gardner,Don Brown,Greg Bophy,Jerry Sonnenberg,John Hickenlooper,Jon Becker,Ken Buck,Landon Gates,Marilyn Musgrave,Michael Bennet,Wayne Allard", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "U.S. Sens.
