An 11-year-old girl was shot in the leg early Sunday while walking with a relative in Denver, police said.

The girl is expected to survive her injuries, Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson said.

The girl was walking with a relative near 47th Avenue and Race Street about 1:45 a.m., Jackson son, when a bullet struck her in the leg.

The girl was taken to an area hospital.

Jackson said police are still investigating and do not have any suspects at this time.

“We’re not sure where the shot came from,” Jackson said. “We don’t know if this was an errant bullet or what.”
