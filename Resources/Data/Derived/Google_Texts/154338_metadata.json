This was their shot. They ran a pretty good campaign against our candidates and we saw it as a chance to make a stand.\n\n\u201cThis was one of the biggest challenges we face in recent years and I am thrilled by the results,\u201d he added.\n\nGolden says he implemented many of the measures he envisioned when he first took on Bennett, a former Senate President. Part of his strategy to beat Bennett included the alliance with Hanlon, who took years ago lost by three votes to Bennett in a challenge for the chairmanship.\n\n\u201cI ran on a platform of making sure we do a better job of party building, diversity outreach, and improvement of technology,\u2019 said Golden.\n\nAs chairman he assigned vice chairmanships to strong personalities around the county, including former Middletown Mayor Tony Fiore and Hanlon in Central Monmouth.\n\n\u201cI call her \u2018the architect\u2019 for a reason,\u201d Golden noted.\n\nPart of the GOP strategy for victory was to highlight the fact that northern politicians, including Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop and Essex Democrats, were funding Gopal\u2019s candidates, but Republicans themselves leaned on Chair of the GOP Chairs Jose Arango of Hudson County for instruction in diversity outreach.\n\n\u201cHe came down a number of times, we had bilingual mail \u2013 for the first time \u2013 that we targeted throughout the county,\u201d Golden said.\n\nThe chairman said they also reanimated the party website, Facebook page and Twitter account.\n\n\u201cOur infrastructure was collapsing,\u201d Hanlon said. \u201cWe needed a strong leader.\u201d\n\nA lifelong Monmouth County resident, Golden hails from Aberdeen and Keyport. He started as a police officer in 1992 for the Colts Neck PD, and holds a master\u2019s degree in administration from Seton Hall University. A NJ Certified Public Manager, he\u2019s also an adjunct professor at Monmouth University with the Department of Political Science and Public Policy.\n\nHe runs a 605-person operation with a $68 million budget.\n\nPolitickerNJ asked the chairman about governor 2017. Both prospective establishment Republican candidates Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagano and Assembly Minority leader Jon Bramnick (R-21) made themselves in Atlantic City this week.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a few years out,\u201d Golden said. \u201cWe\u2019re fortunate that we have some great leaders.\u201d\n\nGuadagno?\n\nShe\u2019s Golden\u2019s predecessor in the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t commit to backing her. Too early.\n\nBut, \u201cShe would make a great governor,\u201d Golden said. \u201cShe is hard-working and very dynamic. We have a good bunch. JB [Jon Bramnick] is a leader. So is Tom Kean Jr.\u201d\n\nAs for Gov. Chris Christie and his 2016 presidential prospects, \u201cHe\u2019d make a great president compared to what is going on right now,\u201d said the GOP chair. \u201cThe country is ripe for hard core, unadulterated leadership.\u201d\n\nGolden said Christie\u2019s successful chairmanship of the Republican Governors Association gives him good traction with key leaders and will help him in a Republican Primary.\n\n\u201cBy campaigning around the country for Republican candidates he has shown his commitment to the Republican Party and Republicans around the country will see that in a Republican Primary,\u201d Golden said.\n\n\u201cGiuliani didn\u2019t have that platform,\u201d Hanlon noted, when PolitickerNJ asked if Christie\u2019s Northeast tough guy act weren\u2019t simply a case of warmed over Rudy.\n\n\u201cThe work he\u2019s done for these candidates will pay off,\u201d Golden said.\n\nThe CW is that the GOP is in a better position to take the presidency and Democrats poised to take governor in reversals of the power paradigm in place now.\n\nGolden says he sees early overconfidence in the opposition party, as prospective 2017 Democrats candidates for governor charge through casino watering holes like a Pamplona bull run.\n\n\u201cIf President Obama keeps up at this pace, he\u2019s not doing Democrats any favors, including the fact that more Obamacare measures kick in in 2015 and 2016. That party will some explaining to do when people feel the impact of Obamacare on the state budget,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for county and legislative politics next year, Golden will put forward iconoclastic incumbent Republican Freeholder John Curley.\n\n\u201cI back him,\u201d said the chairman/sheriff. \u201cHe\u2019s a great candidate.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t look for any changes to the Trenton team.\n\n\u201cOne works harder than the other,\u201d Golden said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t anticipate the challenges we saw this year,\u201d he added with a grin.\n\nEarlier the same day, Golden and Gopal sat down together at the league for a post-game drink in the Irish Pub.\n\n\u201cWe like Vin,\u201d said the chairman, brightening. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal.\u201d\n\nBut he will dismantle him, said the Republican, if the Democrat decides to get ornery again.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/golden.jpg?w=50", "description": "ATLANTIC CITY \u2013 Having deposed an iconic John Bennett and assumed the chairmanship of the Monmouth County Republican Party earlier this year, Sheriff Shaun Golden craved a win on Nov. 4th.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "description": "ATLANTIC CITY \u2013 Having deposed an iconic John Bennett and assumed the chairmanship of the Monmouth County Republican Party earlier this year, Sheriff Shaun Golden craved a win on Nov. 4th.", "title": "Monmouth County GOP Chairman Shaun Golden: The PolitickerNJ Interview", "url": "http://politickernj.com/2014/11/monmouth-county-gop-chairman-shaun-golden-the-politickernj-interview/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/golden.jpg?w=1200", "height": 900}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/golden.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@PolitickerNJ", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PolitickerNJ"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-20 10:01:45", "sailthru.title": "Monmouth County GOP Chairman Shaun Golden: The PolitickerNJ Interview", "fb": {"app_id": 710865528969413}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politickernj.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "New Jersey News, Politics, Opinion, and Analysis", "keywords": "monmouth county, christine hanlon, shaun golden, vin gopal, john curley, lillian burry,  jon bramnick, chris christie", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PolitickerNJ", "published_time": "2014-11-20T15:01:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-21T12:52:52+00:00", "author": "http://wordpress.com/author/max"}, "sailthru.description": "ATLANTIC CITY \u2013 Having deposed an iconic John Bennett and assumed the chairmanship of the Monmouth County Republican Party earlier this year, Sheriff Shaun Golden craved a win on Nov. 4th.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/golden.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Monmouth County, Christine Hanlon, Shaun Golden, Vin Gopal, John Curley, Lillian Burry,  Jon Bramnick, Chris Christie"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe came down a number of times, we had bilingual mail \u2013 for the first time \u2013 that we targeted throughout the county,\u201d Golden said.\nATLANTIC CITY \u2013 Having deposed an iconic John Bennett and assumed the chairmanship of the Monmouth County Republican Party earlier this year, Sheriff Shaun Golden craved a win on Nov. 4th.\nBut, \u201cShe would make a great governor,\u201d Golden said.\n\u201cWe needed a strong leader.\u201dA lifelong Monmouth County resident, Golden hails from Aberdeen and Keyport.\nAs chairman he assigned vice chairmanships to strong personalities around the county, including former Middletown Mayor Tony Fiore and Hanlon in Central Monmouth."}
