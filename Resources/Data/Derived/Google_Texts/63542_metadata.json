Peter Shumlin speaks during a hearing before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee April 14, 2011 on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\n4413185\n\nVermont Gov. Peter Shumlin is canceling his dream plan to create a single-payer health system in the state, he announced Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI am not going to undermine the hope of achieving critically important health care reforms for this state by pushing prematurely for single payer when it is not the right time for Vermont,\u201d Shumlin said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cIn my judgment, now is not the right time to ask our legislature to take the step of passing a financing plan for Green Mountain Care.\u201d\n\nThe problem is, of course, how to pay for it. Even while plans were moving forward for a 2017 launch of the single-payer system, to be called Green Mountain Care, Shumlin had held off on releasing a plan for how to pay for the system, waiting until his announcement Wednesday.\n\nTax hikes required to pay for the system would include a 11.5 percent payroll tax as well as an additional income tax ranging all the way up to 9.5 percent. Shumlin admitted that in the current climate, such a precipitous hike would be disastrous for Vermont\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cPushing for single payer health care when the time isn\u2019t right and it might hurt our economy would not be good for Vermont and it would not be good for true health care reform,\u201d Shumlin said. \u201cIt could set back for years all of our hard work toward the important goal of universal, publicly-financed health care for all.\u201d\n\nShumlin\u2019s office released a slideshow with more details about financing for the plan which fell through. The state had been anticipating $267 million in federal funding to revamp its system, courtesy of a 2013 Obamacare waiver \u2014 but the current estimate has fallen to $106 million. Vermont also overestimated by $150 million in federal Medicaid funding.\n\nBut beyond federal funding, the report also admits that the single-payer system won\u2019t save money as Vermont officials had planned. While both previous reports on Green Mountain Care had assumed \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d in savings in the very first year of operation, Shumlin\u2019s office is now admitting that\u2019s \u201cnot practical to achieve.\u201d\n\n\u201cState government and providers need to partner to bend cost curve over time,\u201d the report concluded. And the state admitted that while it would need to \u201cease the transition\u201d for Vermont\u2019s businesses, it would be \u201cextremely expensive\u201d to do so.\n\nShumlin also cited slow economic recovery in Vermont as reason to delay, and hopes to try again in the future. But its failure, especially on economic grounds, is a resounding defeat for single-payer advocates.\n\nMany opponents of Obamacare continue to maintain that national health reform didn\u2019t go far enough. Retiring Sen. Tom Harkin, who helped author Obamacare, recently expressed his regret that the health care law passed at all because it didn\u2019t create single-payer. (RELATED: Harkin: We Shouldn\u2019t Have Passed Obamacare The Way We Did)\n\nShumlin\u2019s admission that the shift to single-payer won\u2019t alleviate rising health care costs \u2014 and that it\u2019ll add a bundle of tax hikes \u2014 buttresses single-payer\u2019s political opposition.\n\nVermont Lt. Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, applauded the decision to back off the plans.\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said continually over the last two years, if the Governor\u2019s single-payer plan places another burden on already overtaxed Vermonters, we simply cannot afford it,\u201d Scott said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cOur State cannot afford a $2.6 billion bill, and Vermont cannot afford to continue down this path of uncertainty. We\u2019ve already spent far too much money exploring this idea, and the discussion has paralyzed our business community.\u201d\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "'We simply cannot afford it'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Vermont Gov.
