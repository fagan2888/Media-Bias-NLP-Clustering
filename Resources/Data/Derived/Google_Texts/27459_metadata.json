(NYSE: MOH) to a real beating on Thursday after reporting a bad miss on first-quarter earnings. The stock was down nearly 20% on Friday after the company said it missed the consensus earnings per share estimate by $0.27.\n\nWhat happened? During the company\u2019s conference call CEO Joseph Molina said that the big miss was the result of Medicaid reimbursement rates\u2019 failure to keep up with rising medical costs. That failure cost the company $0.55 share in diluted earnings per share.\n\nRevenues increased but that wasn\u2019t enough to offset the rise in costs. Molina appears to have been caught in the same trap that ensnared many other insurers: in an effort to sign up new subscribers the insurers underestimated the number of sick people who would be signing up for coverage under Obamacare after years of being excluded from coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions. Why insurers were surprised by this is anybody\u2019s guess.\n\n\n\nIn addition to higher utilization in these [Ohio, Texas, and Puerto Rico] markets, the company cited an IT system that couldn\u2019t manage its growth as a contributing factor, and the lack of infrastructure is a true concern for a growth company like MOH. MOH lowered adjusted EPS guidance 29% and despite cutting net margin guidance to 0.8%, management reiterated its GAAP net margin target of 1.5-2.0% by the end of 2017. \u2026 Our Underperform rating is predicated on low visibility into the ability for MOH to meaningfully improve the medical margin on its base business over a relatively short timeframe in order to achieve 2017 margin targets, particularly in light of the Q1 setback. We believe margins will eventually trend higher, but at a slower pace than expected by management.\n\nThe near future, at least for Molina, does not hold a lot of hope for a dramatic change, according to analysts at Merrill Lynch, who downgraded the stock to Underperform and slashed their price objective from $93 to $50 a share. Here\u2019s what they said:\n\nOther analyst calls pretty much lined up with this:\n\nCredit Suisse cut its price target from $64 to $55 and has a Neutral rating on the stock.\n\nSusquehanna chopped its price target from $92 to $74 and has Positive view.\n\nBarclays cut its price target from $72 to $54 with an Equal Weight rating.\n\nJefferies slashed its target price from $73 to $66 and maintains a Buy rating.\n\nUBS cut its price target from $76 to $54 and cut the stock\u2019s rating from Buy to Neutral.\n\nMolina\u2019s stock closed at $51.76 on Friday, down 19.4% for the day, in a 52-week range of $48.00 to $82.37. The consensus price range on the stock is $64.43, and that almost surely does not include these recent changes.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Analyst Downgrades,", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://247wallst.com/healthcare-business/2016/05/01/did-molina-healthcares-future-just-get-compromised/", "type": "article", "image": "https://247wallst.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/thinkstockphotos-507959049.jpg?w=400", "site_name": "247wallst.com", "title": "Did Molina Healthcare\u2019s Future Just Get\u00a0Compromised?"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Insightful Analysis and Commentary for U.S. and Global Equity Investors", "fb": {"admins": "1637394913,9110202", "app_id": 209662835720614}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "24/7 Wall St.", "keywords": "Healthcare Business, Analyst Downgrades", "verify-v1": "IODtZuG2ioY7pGg0quJbNSfBusGQMgChxukhNrOGdN4=", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://247wallst.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "description": "Molina Healthcare to a real beating after reporting a bad miss on first-quarter earnings.
