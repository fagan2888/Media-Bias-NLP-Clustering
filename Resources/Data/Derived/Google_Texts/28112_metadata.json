(Photo: Rod Sanford/Lansing State Journal)\n\nALAIEDON TWP. \u2013 The pace of hiring has been so brisk at Jackson National Life Insurance over the past few years that it has filled the 314,000-square-foot headquarters it built here in 1999.\n\nThe insurer began a $100-million expansion project last year, which will include a new 225,000-square-foot building to house 1,100 information technology and legal associates, but the project won\u2019t wrap until October.\n\n\u201cWe have absolutely no more space here,\u201d said James Sopha, president of Jackson National, which employs 2,600 at its headquarters.\n\nA challenge for the company, perhaps, but a boon for the region.\n\nAs Jackson National continues to add more people in IT and customer service in the next year, it will push greater Lansing\u2019s employment in the insurance and financial sector to 10,000.\n\nThat will put the region on par with insurance hubs such as Hartford, Conn., and Indianapolis, said Bob Trezise, president and CEO of the Lansing Economic Area Partnership.\n\n\u201cThis is the tipping point for getting us on the national map as a major player in the industry,\u201d he said.\n\nThe six insurance companies headquartered here \u2014 Jackson National, Accident Fund Insurance, Delta Dental of Michigan, Auto-Owners Insurance, Farm Bureau Insurance of Michigan and Michigan Millers Mutual Insurance \u2014 have a combined employment of 6,392.\n\nSmaller insurance company branches located in the region account for roughly 900 more jobs while the financial industry adds roughly 2,600 jobs. Combined, it adds up to a sector of nearly 9,900.\n\nWhen the industry reaches the 10,000 worker milestone, industry leaders said, insurance companies across the country and organizations that support them increasingly will consider greater Lansing as a place to do business.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when you own a restaurant and another one plops down next to you,\u201d said Lu Battaglieri, senior vice president of Okemos-based Delta Dental of Michigan. \u201cWhen you have multiple options for people, it brings more people to the area \u2014 but for us it\u2019s in terms of getting good employees. I look forward to it.\u201d\n\nHistorically, the three pillars of the region\u2019s economy have been Michigan State University, the auto industry and state government. Insurance and finance is ready to join that vital group. \u201cThis is the fourth pillar,\u201d Trezise said.\n\n\u201cMy prediction is that in the next decade or two, this pillar will dominate the others.\u201d\n\nAssured growth\n\nThe insurance industry is one of the fastest growing sectors in the country, projected by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics to grow at a rate of more than 2% a year through the end of the decade.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an industry where there aren\u2019t highs and lows with the economy because people have to buy insurance,\u201d said Lori Conarton, communications director at the Insurance Institute of Michigan.\n\nOf course, the strengthening economy and increases in employment and net household wealth help.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a growth in the number of employees being hired that need insurance,\u201d said Jim Robinson, CEO of Farm Bureau Insurance, which has expanded from agricultural insurance to 10 other areas of coverage since 1949. \u201cMore people are buying cars, homes and boats, too. All of that needs to be protected.\u201d\n\nThe same goes for Lansing-based Accident Fund, which has expanded its workers\u2019 compensation coverage to most of the country through three other brands separate from itself: United Heartland, CompWest and Third Coast Underwriters, the latter having just expanded to Oklahoma.\n\nDelta Township-based Auto-Owners Insurance recently acquired North Carolina-based Atlantic Casualty Insurance, which will allow the Fortune 500 company to offer high-risk insurance and expand its footprint from 26 states to 48.\n\nThere are factors beyond the more robust economy driving growth, John Lindauer, the company\u2019s corporate communications manager, said in an e-mail.\n\n\u201cReliance on automation and data analytics has increased the need for more I.T. and actuarial staff,\u201d he said. The increase in widespread weather events also is creating \u201ca growth spurt in claims,\u201d which the company has created special teams to address.\n\nBehind Jackson National\u2019s growth? Baby boomers. Every day 10,000 of them reach retirement age in the country.\n\n\u201cThe baby boomers are the wealthiest generation in the history of humanity and they are a primary focus as more retire,\u201d said Sopha, whose company helps people invest their money so they can receive an annual income after retirement.\n\nNew health care laws also affect the industry.\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act went into effect and Michigan expanded Medicaid, Delta Dental has added roughly 600,000 new policy holders in the state, Battaglieri said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s brought in a lot of new people into the insurance world,\u201d he said.\n\nInvesting in talent\n\nThe insurance companies based here formed between the 1880s and 1960s because of the proximity to lawmakers at the Capitol, the affordable cost of living and the talent pool trained by the longstanding programs at MSU and Olivet College, said Mike Hubbel, former director of Olivet\u2019s Risk Management and Insurance Center, which started in 1980.\n\n\u201cIt does attract attention when you have a known labor pool,\u201d Hubbel said. \u201cInsurance companies pay attention to where their employees are coming from.\u201d\n\nAuto-Owners has partnered with MSU\u2019s actuarial science program, hiring its graduates in recent years as well.\n\nJackson National partnered with MSU in 2013 to employ roughly 300 students part-time in downtown East Lansing through the Zone, to train them for future employment at the company.\n\nThe Zone, in a former Barnes & Noble storefront on busy Grand River Avenue right across the street from campus, gives students a chance to set their own hours and gain experience in the industry before graduation. That creates a crucial talent pipeline, MSU and Jackson National officials have said.\n\n\u201cHaving access to young talent is important for our continued success,\u201d Sopha said. \u201cRecruiting has become more and more competitive and we wanted to get closer to the university. These graduates are highly sought after.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because, in 10 years, it is estimated that the insurance industry will need to replace 40% of its workforce because of retirement, according to the Insurance Institute.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost at a crisis,\u201d Conarton said. \u201cWe need to start attracting youth because we\u2019ll need employees to replace the people who are retiring in the next five to 10 years.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s rare that a high school student dreams of working in insurance, but part of attracting the younger generation starts with changing his or her perception of the industry, said Mike Maurer, Accident Fund\u2019s regional director.\n\n\u201cThey say, \u2018I don\u2019t need to be concerned with insurance, it\u2019s boring,\u2019 \u201d Maurer said. \u201cThe idea is have them make a career in insurance a choice instead of just an opportunity to get a job.\u201d\n\nCareer potential\n\nIt was the sleek business suits that piqued Eric Dawdy\u2019s interest. In 2011, when he was a senior at Holt High School, he attended a student-run seminar at Olivet College.\n\n\u201cI never saw myself being in the insurance industry myself \u2014 I wanted to be a plumber,\u201d Dawdy said. \u201cI looked down at the panel of students and said, \u2018This is what I want to be one day.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDawdy is now a senior at Olivet and an intern at Accident Fund\u2019s headquarters in downtown Lansing, where he mentors the students in the leadership academy. On Sept. 28, he\u2019ll be hired on as a business development associate.\n\n\u201cI have friends at MSU who haven\u2019t yet graduated college,\u201d Dawdy said, \u201cand I have a full-time job.\u201d\n\nIt pays well, too, on average. The median salary for an insurance sales agent in Michigan is $48,000. An actuary typically makes $94,000. The average annual income in the Lansing region is $45,000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a stable career,\u201d Conarton said. \u201cThe high school students I talk to, they\u2019ve experienced their parents on highs and lows during the recession. The insurance industry doesn\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\nAnd, unlike the region\u2019s auto industry or its state government workforce, insurance is growing.\n\n\u201cI think we should be focusing our workforce development on the insurance industry,\u201d Trezise said. \u201cThese are good jobs that are well paid across all skill levels where you can have a career\u2019s worth of upward mobility. You don\u2019t find a lot of industries that can say that to people.\u201d\n\nContact Alexander Alusheff: 517-388-5973 or aalusheff@lsj.com.
