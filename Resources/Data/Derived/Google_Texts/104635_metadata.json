Although Sanders has stated he would endorse Clinton as the nominee, many of his supporters see Clinton as part of the plutocracy they\u2019re fighting against. But shouldn\u2019t Sanders voters back Clinton\u2019s incremental progress when the GOP\u2019s message of intolerance threatens to take America back generations? Actor, LGBT-rights activist and Star Trek-star George Takei thinks so.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Democrat, and as many of you have seen, I\u2019m also a fan of Bernie Sanders,\u201d Takei said in a video posted on his wildly-popular Facebook page. \u201cHaving been through many bruising primaries in my life, I\u2019m also a realist. From where I sit, the math is clear, Hillary will likely win and she will be our nominee, but that doesn\u2019t mean Bernie didn\u2019t also win.\u201d Takei then praised Sanders for bringing important issues to the campaign and his supporters for thier passion.\n\nAlthough Sanders\u2019 views are to the left of Clinton\u2019s, Takei pointed out there are many issues the two agree upon, including: Obamacare, raising the minimum wage, protecting a woman\u2019s right to choose, making college affordable and LGBT rights. \u201cOn her worst day, Hillary Clinton will be an infinitely better candidate and president than the Republican candidate on his best day,\u201d Takei said, quoting Sanders. \u201cIf Bernie believes that, his supporters can, too.\u201d\n\nGeorge Takei invites people to discuss the issue further at #VoteBlueNoMatterWho\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "33 percent of Sanders supporters say they won't vote for Clinton", "og": {"site_name": "GOOD Magazine", "description": "33 percent of Sanders supporters say they won't vote for Clinton", "title": "George Takei Has Some Words Of Wisdom For the \u2018Bernie Or Bust\u2019 Crowd", "url": "https://www.good.is/articles/vote-blue-no-matter-who", "image": "https://assets.goodstatic.com/s3/magazine/assets/557696/original/Takei_1200.jpg=s1200x1200", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "33 percent of Sanders supporters say they won't vote for Clinton", "title": "George Takei Has Some Words Of Wisdom For the \u2018Bernie Or Bust\u2019 Crowd", "url": "https://www.good.is/articles/vote-blue-no-matter-who", "image": "https://assets.goodstatic.com/s3/magazine/assets/557696/original/Takei_1200.jpg=s1200x1200", "site": "@good", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#009cff", "robots": "noodp, noydir", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "csrf-token": "7v5QFRgSdZ2+Cs3KpXSDUi+oq/MbOYxwtWnJ2A21Ra8iWjc3J0iXYoHLOFbDisdJGr4JBAcgpwbm6APg/itD0A==", "fb": {"admins": 100004372031382, "app_id": 590727534352624, "pages": 13152108058}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/GOODHQ", "section": "Communities", "tag": "elections and politics", "published_time": "2016-04-28T11:20:00Z", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T15:09:35Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1edf\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf Bernie believes that, his supporters can, too.\u201dGeorge Takei invites people to discuss the issue further at #VoteBlueNoMatterWho\n\u201cI\u2019m a Democrat, and as many of you have seen, I\u2019m also a fan of Bernie Sanders,\u201d Takei said in a video posted on his wildly-popular Facebook page.\n\u201cOn her worst day, Hillary Clinton will be an infinitely better candidate and president than the Republican candidate on his best day,\u201d Takei said, quoting Sanders.\nA poll taken last month by The Washington Post and NBC found that 33 percent of Bernie Sanders supporters cannot see themselves voting for Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election.\nAlthough Sanders has stated he would endorse Clinton as the nominee, many of his supporters see Clinton as part of the plutocracy they\u2019re fighting against."}
