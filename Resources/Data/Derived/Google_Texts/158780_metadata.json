(Marlon Correa/El Tiempo Latino)\n\nDavid Trone was a kid on his family\u2019s chicken and hog farm in southeast Pennsylvania, not a Potomac wine retailer and philanthropist, when he first thought about entering politics.\n\nHe admired the local congressman, a moderate Republican named Bill Goodling. Most of all, though, he wanted to run as Tom Trone\u2019s son.\n\n\u201cMy goal was to grow up on a farm, build Tom Trone\u2019s Eggs into a real agribusiness so everyone knew Tom Trone\u2019s Eggs,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I could run for Congress as David Trone and people would know us and love us, and I could do something that would make a difference.\u201d\n\nThe farm failed, as Trone explains in one of his ubiquitous, skillfully produced campaign ads. What the spot doesn\u2019t say is that Tom Trone\u2019s alcoholism doomed the business. The memory is raw enough that his son\u2019s eyes well up as he tells that part of the story.\n\n\u201cThe bank took the farm, they took our home, they took everything,\u201d Trone said. \u201cAnd my mom divorced my dad, rightfully so.\u201d\n\nTrone had planned on law school after studying government at Furman University in South Carolina. Instead, he borrowed money to attend Wharton business school at the University of Pennsylvania. By the time he graduated in 1985, he and his brother Robert had started building what is now Total Wine & More, a national chain of 132 big-box stores with projected sales of $2.5 billion this year.\n\nAt age 60, politics is Trone\u2019s unfinished business. \u201cI don\u2019t need a job,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m looking to do what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nTrone upended the race when he entered just before the Feb. 3 filing deadline, joining a field of eight whose front-runners were expected to be state Sen. Jamie Raskin (Montgomery) and former Marriott executive and WJLA anchor Kathleen Matthews.\n\n[Polls by Matthews, Trone paint differing pictures of 8th District primary]\n\nHis decision to run, and to spend millions financing his candidacy, has made the April 26 primary a three-way contest. And his core message \u2014 that paying his own way leaves him unencumbered by special interests \u2014 echoes a Republican presidential candidate with a similar-sounding name.\n\nAlthough Trone is a progressive Democrat who says he rejects every\u00adthing GOP front-runner Donald Trump stands for, a Trumpian grandiosity comes through when he talks about his business success.\n\n\u201cEvery state I go, I\u2019m the pioneer. I\u2019m the trendsetter,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe are vilified by our competitors, and we are loved by the consumers.\u201d\n\n\n\nDavid Trone, left, chats with Ana Sol Gutierrez during a forum of candidates for Maryland's 8th Congressional District. (Bill O\u2019Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nTrone\u2019s issue set is thoughtful and detailed. He shares most of his opponents\u2019 prescriptives \u2014 higher minimum wage, fixes to the Affordable Care Act, curbs on gun violence. He wants to double the National Institutes of Health\u2019s funding for research on cancer, autism and Alzheimer\u2019s, which claimed his father in 2011. Trone also favors college loan forgiveness in exchange for five years of national service.\n\nWhen friends ask why, at the peak of a successful career, he aspires to be a freshman back\u00adbencher, he tells them he expects to be an exception. \u201cI\u2019ve been a leader all my life,\u201d he said.\n\n[Why Trone is willing spend his own millions to win a Congressional seat ]\n\nTrone has raised \u2014 and given \u2014 millions for the Democratic Party and candidates. He has also donated $150,000 to red-state Republicans, which he describes as the price of admission to make his case to regulators and officeholders. Trone insists that he has never used his access to seek tax benefits or other advantages, instead pursuing an agenda that is \u201c100 percent pro-consumer\u201d \u2014 such as laws allowing Sunday store hours and sales of craft beer.\n\nLast year, he and his wife, longtime supporters of the American Civil Liberties Union, donated $15 million to study criminal justice reform. Also last year, his company gave $6 million to charities in 18 states, according to Trone.\n\nDespite the good works, his business background sometimes kindles suspicion among Democratic primary voters in the left-leaning 8th District. As a hard-charging chief executive more accustomed to asking questions than answering them, he can turn prickly when pressed.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver breakfast with Silver Spring Democrats at the Tastee Diner last month, Trone spoke at length about pay and benefits for his 5,000 employees. Seventy percent have full-time jobs, unheard of in retail, he said.\n\n\u201cTake care of your people, they take care of your customers,\u201d he said. \u201cYou take care of your customers, everybody wins.\u201d\n\nToward the end of the one-hour session, a man sitting off to the side asked how many full-time workers made at least $15 an hour \u2014 the amount targeted by labor activists as a fair minimum wage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an HR fiend,\u201d Trone said, stretching out the last word before continuing. \u201cIf you run a $2 billion business, I\u2019m just going to give you a heads-up. You don\u2019t know every stat in the business.\u201d\n\nThe questioner persisted: \u201cMy follow-up is, since you don\u2019t know right now, could you find out this week and tell your prospective voters?\u201d\n\nA seasoned candidate might have said, \u201cSure, we\u2019ll be get back to you,\u201d even if he had no intention of doing so.\n\nInstead, Trone pushed back: \u201cI\u2019m not here for gotcha questions. That was a gotcha. I\u2019m going to skip that one, thank you.\u201d\n\nNext in the series: Joel Rubin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "First in a series of profiles of Democratic primary candidates in Maryland\u2019s 8th Congressional District.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/bill.turque", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "First in a series of profiles of Democratic primary candidates in Maryland\u2019s 8th Congressional District.", "title": "For wine mogul David Trone, congressional race is unfinished business", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/for-wine-mogul-david-trone-congressional-race-is-unfinished-business/2016/04/03/cf89ed4c-f5d0-11e5-a3ce-f06b5ba21f33_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/03/23/Local/Images/DSC_89191458746831.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@bturque"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "election 2016 trone wine farm, mdpolitics, ppinclude", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/bill.turque"}, "eomportal-uuid": "cf89ed4c-f5d0-11e5-a3ce-f06b5ba21f33", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "election 2016 trone wine farm, mdpolitics, ppinclude"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMy goal was to grow up on a farm, build Tom Trone\u2019s Eggs into a real agribusiness so everyone knew Tom Trone\u2019s Eggs,\u201d he said.\nWhat the spot doesn\u2019t say is that Tom Trone\u2019s alcoholism doomed the business.\n\u201cIf you run a $2 billion business, I\u2019m just going to give you a heads-up.\nDavid Trone is a Democratic primary candidate in Maryland\u2019s 8th Congressional District.\nDespite the good works, his business background sometimes kindles suspicion among Democratic primary voters in the left-leaning 8th District."}
