Bernie Sanders of Vermont has no chance of winning the Democratic presidential nomination at this point, short of a minor miracle. But depending on how he plays his cards over the coming weeks, the champion of his party\u2019s liberal wing could sway Hillary Clinton\u2019s key decisions.\n\nA progressive Democrat like Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts or Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, might look a lot better to Clinton as a vice presidential running mate if Sanders gives his blessing.\n\nRelated: Sanders Vows to Stay in the Race Despite Huge NY Loss\n\nThe 2016 Democratic platform might also be heavily rewritten this summer to include some of Sanders\u2019 best lines challenging the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, seeking to downsize big banks on Wall Street or even a rethinking of U.S. policy towards Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nAnd Democratic Party rules, ranging from the role of \u201csuper delegates\u201d in choosing a nominee to the exclusion of independents from some state primaries, might get a fresh scrubbing with Sanders pushing for reforms.\n\nIn the wake of Clinton\u2019s 16-point drubbing of Sanders in Tuesday\u2019s New York Democratic primary, there appears to be an emerging consensus within the party that Sanders must begin to adjust to the inevitability that Clinton, the former secretary of state, will amass the necessary delegates to claim the nomination this summer.\n\nClinton now has 1,930 of the 2,383 pledged and \u201csuper\u201d delegates she will need to win the nomination, compared to just 1,189 delegates for Sanders. If Clinton has another good week next Tuesday in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland and Rhode Island, experts say it will be pretty much \u201cgame over.\u201d\n\nRelated: Trump and Clinton Sweep New York and Score Big Delegates\n\nSanders and his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, insist that the campaign will carry on to the convention, even if Clinton amasses enough pledged delegates to win the nomination before then.\n\nBut with no readily identifiable path to the nomination, Sanders must begin to consider his options for a graceful glide path to the convention \u2013 one that simultaneously lowers the tensions between him and Clinton while maximizing his leverage to influence the convention and the fall campaign.\n\nBy any measurement, Sanders has waged a remarkable campaign that has galvanized millions of new, young voters and produced 15 victories so far in primary and caucus states \u2013 with more to come.\n\nRelated: Clinton Can Start Writing Her Nomination Acceptance Speech After NY Win\n\nAnd with essentially all the money he needs to keep his campaign afloat through the convention in July, Sanders is free to continue pounding away at Clinton if he chooses while piling up more delegates.\n\nSanders will enter the national convention in Philadelphia with an impressive total of national delegates \u2013 many of them rabid supporters who resent Clinton and her policies \u2013 and with plenty of leverage to influence the shape and tone of the convention.\n\nBut it will be a difficult balancing act \u2013 for both Sanders and Clinton. And history shows that brilliant political also-rans like Sanders can seriously undercut the party\u2019s nominee.\n\nRelated: Clinton vs. Trump: Get Ready for the Nastiest General Election in Memory\n\nThe late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts badly upstaged President Jimmy Carter during the 1980 Democratic convention in New York with a fiery, uncompromising speech after a protracted battle.\n\n\u201cIf I were advising Bernie, there\u2019s no reason to drop out before the end,\u201d Norman Ornstein, a political scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, said Thursday. \u201cAmass more delegates, because the more you have at the convention \u2013 the greater the proportion \u2013 the more bargaining power or leverage you have at the convention.\u201d\n\nLarry J. Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, said, \u201cThere\u2019s no chance Bernie will be picked as VP, so that\u2019s a bridge too far.\u201d\n\nBut short of garnering the second spot on the ticket \u2013 which seems preposterous given the huge differences between the two candidates on most things\u2013 there is plenty that Sanders could still achieve at the convention and during the fall campaign.\n\nRelated: Sanders\u2019 Attacks Are Taking a Serious Toll on Clinton\n\nHere are five things Sanders could ask for \u2013 and likely would get:\n\nA big say in the choice of Clinton\u2019s running mate. Clinton is going to have a tough time winning over many of Sanders\u2019 true-blue supporters, but one way of doing that is bringing on board one of their own. One obvious choice would be Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), the long-time consumer advocate and banking industry scold who many liberals had hoped would challenge Clinton.\n\n\n\nThe Boston Globe has reported that senior Clinton campaign officials say Clinton is willing to consider choosing another woman to run on the ticket. Whether the country is ready to shatter the glass ceiling by electing a presidential team of two women is open to conjecture. But if Warren doesn\u2019t make it, Clinton can choose from other prominent liberal Democrats, including Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Merkley, who recently endorsed Sanders.\n\n\n\nEnsuring that Sanders\u2019 top advisers, including Jeff Weaver and Tad Devine, end up well positioned in the general election campaign. If Sanders is going to be a big player in the fall campaign to beat Donald Trump, he will need his people closely coordinating with Clinton\u2019s national team.\n\n\n\nA prime-time speaking slot at the convention. Sanders will ask for and get an opportunity to unleash his tirade against the excesses of Wall Street, income inequality and a corrupt campaign finance system. The risk for Clinton is that the speech might remind voters of the residual deep divisions between the two candidates and achieve little in terms of unifying the party.\n\n\n\nA big say in drafting the Democratic platform. No doubt, there will be platform promises on raising the federal minimum wage to between $12 and $15 an hour; a rebuke to some international trade deals that Sanders says have cost millions of Americans jobs; and the need for Wall Street prosecutions, and campaign finance reform.\n\n\n\nA commitment to changing the rules for selecting the nominee the next time around. Sanders has complained bitterly about the current party rules \u2013 both at the national and state level \u2013 arguing that they are not truly democratic and bar greater voter participation.\n\nOne likely target: the role of elected party leaders and officials known as \u201csuper\u201d delegates who automatically vote at the convention and typically support more establishment candidates like Clinton. Sanders wants to diminish their role, or force them to reflect the popular will of their states. Another would be state party rules like the ones in New York and Pennsylvania that prevent independents from participating in \u201cclosed\u201d primary elections.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Sen.", "title": "Five Demands Sanders Can Get From Clinton at the Convention", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/22/Five-Demands-Sanders-Can-Get-Clinton-Convention", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09112015_Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/22/Five-Demands-Sanders-Can-Get-Clinton-Convention", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/09112015_Bernie_Sanders.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Sen.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Boston Globe has reported that senior Clinton campaign officials say Clinton is willing to consider choosing another woman to run on the ticket.\nClinton now has 1,930 of the 2,383 pledged and \u201csuper\u201d delegates she will need to win the nomination, compared to just 1,189 delegates for Sanders.\nBut it will be a difficult balancing act \u2013 for both Sanders and Clinton.\nSen.
