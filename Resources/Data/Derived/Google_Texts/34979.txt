PANAMA CITY BEACH -- The Panama City Beach Fire Rescue spent this morning teaching families about fire safety at their annual open house.

Firefighters had face painting stations, food and even a bouncy house. Kids also had the chance to spray water onto a fake fire.

Event organizers say hundreds showed up to today's event. Each year the open house gets bigger.

The Panama City Beach fire rescue station has hosted open houses for over twenty years.

Firefighter/EMT Garrett Jackson said, "I just like that the kids get to come and see us…get to see what a fireman does…get to put on the gear. You know it makes their day."

Open House Visitor Mickayla said, "If there's a fire, they'll take it down so I can, so I’m safe.

The annual fire prevention open house is usually in October of each year. This year the event was postponed because of tropical storm Karen. Firefighters plan to continue this annual open house next year.
