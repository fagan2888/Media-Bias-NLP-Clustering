Nonetheless, Hoffman told Jacob he wouldn\u2019t buy him the popular yuletide toy but promised that the boy could have a \u201cMensch on a Bench,\u201d a Jewish alternative. Only, at that point, the Mensch on a Bench didn\u2019t exist.\n\n\u201cIt was like a light went on,\u201d said Hoffman, who knows the toy business from his tenure at Hasbro, where he worked with top sellers such as GI Joe and Tonka trucks.\n\nWithin days, Hoffman created the story of \u201cMoshe,\u201d a character who with his felt hat, thick beard and prayer shawl looks like he could fit into a cartoon version of \u201cFiddler on the Roof.\u201d Some Orthodox Jews have told Hoffman that they like the \u201cMensch\u201d because he looks like one of them, albeit in a 12-inch size.\n\nRelated: 10 of the Most Inappropriate Toys for Kids\n\n\u201cMensch\u201d is a Yiddish word that means a righteous or honorable person, and Hoffman credited \u201cMoshe\u201d with the awesome responsibility of watching over the oil that unexpectedly burned for eight days in the ancient Jewish temple, according to lore \u2014 the miracle at the heart of the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah.\n\nHanukkah is not the \u201cJewish equivalent of Christmas,\u201d but the two holidays fall at roughly the same time each year and many Jews have adopted aspects of Christmas, as the plethora of \u201cChrismakah\u201d merchandise indicates. Many Jews in the U.S. didn\u2019t start giving elaborate Christmas-like gifts on Hanukkah until fairly recently. \u201cClearly the custom of exchanging gifts at this time of the year has influenced the Jewish community in the U.S.,\u201d Rabbi Victor S. Appell, congregational marketing director at the Union for Reform Judaism, said in an email.\n\nHoffman is trying to create a new tradition for the holiday, which celebrates not just the miracle of the oil but also the military victory of a group of Jewish rebels known as the Maccabees over the Seleucids who ruled Israel at the time.\n\nHoffman\u2019s modern Hanukkah tale, though, is nearly as improbable as the ancient one. Not only did Hoffman trademark the name \u201cMensch on a Bench\u201d three days ahead of someone else, he also raised $25,000 from a Kickstarter campaign. Word of mouth publicity for the product has been especially strong.\n\n\u201cI held off on launching the website\u201d to iron out some production problems, Hoffman said, adding that Moshe debuted in cyberspace on Oct. 31, 2013. \u201cBy November 9, we were completely sold out.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoshe\u201d mania is continuing in 2014. Hoffman expects to do $800,000 in sales this year, moving more than 50,000 Mensches and generating a profit for Hoffman. \u201cWe could have probably sold 100,000 units this year,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Holiday Shopping Alert \u2014 The Most Dangerous Toys for Kids\n\n\u201cMoshe\u201d is being promoted on Target.com and is available at other retailers, such as Bed Bath & Beyond. Hoffman, though, says he is building his business slowly because he doesn\u2019t want to oversaturate the market and create a fad that will inevitably fade from the public\u2019s consciousness. At the suggestion of partner David Scher, Hoffman arranged for major retailers to take delivery of their orders in China, enabling him to operate his business without any inventory costs, a huge savings.\n\n\u201cMoshe\u201d will become even more famous this week, when Hoffman is set to appear on an episode of the hit ABC show Shark Tank. The creator went on the show to attract new investors who could fund his expansion plans.\n\nHoffman wasn\u2019t able to discuss what happened on the show before it airs, but he did say he has plenty of ideas on how to move Moshe into new products. First, he\u2019s focusing on conquering another Jewish holiday, Passover. Hoffman figures the Mensch would be a welcome guest at many Jewish seders.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "When Neal Hoffman\u2019s 4-year-old son Jacob told him during the 2012 holiday season that", "title": "It\u2019s a Hanukkah Miracle!
