It won\u2019t be long before every physician will be judged, at least in part, by how well he or she keeps these benchmarks of diabetes under control among the practice\u2019s patients.\n\nBut as commentators note in EBDM, a publication of The American Journal of Managed Care, there\u2019s more to diabetes care than the \u201cA,B,C,s.\u201d Authors discuss why it\u2019s important to take individual needs into account, especially for older patients, as well as a second generation of indicators that speak more to patient need.\n\nWith diabetes affecting 29.1 million Americans and prediabetes affecting as many as 86 million, measurement isn\u2019t going away\u2014but its nature may change. Features include:\n\n\n\nIan Hargraves, PhD; Rene Rodriguez-Gutierrez, MD; and Victor M.

Gabbay, MD, PhD, FACP, of the Joslin Diabetes Center introduce readers to the Joslin Clinical Analytic Tool in \u201cMeasuring the Quality of Diabetes Care.\u201d Dr. Gabbay, the chief medical officer and senior vice president at Joslin, is the editor-in-chief of EBDM.\n\nOther features include a discussion of the role of the clinical pharmacist in improving diabetes care, the use of questionnaires to record patient-reported outcomes, the importance of data security as health systems store patient measures, and the emergence of a novel serum biomarker test to predict cardiovascular events among diabetes patients.\n\nEBDM\u2019s mission is to bring together stakeholder viewpoints from across diabetes care: providers, payers, patient advocates, policymakers, and the pharmaceutical industry. AJMC\u2019s upcoming meeting, Patient-Centered Diabetes Care, will meet April 7-8, 2016, in Teaneck, N.J.\n\nFor registration, visit here.
