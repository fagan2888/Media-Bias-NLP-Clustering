They were subjects of cocktail party or breakfast table fulmination, sure, but did not impinge much on my own time, sanity or bank account. Then I got pregnant.\n\nMy subsequent misadventures in the health insurance jungle are in no way remarkable\u2014their very ordinariness is what's so disturbing. They show that the fantasy of a free market solution to our healthcare mess is misguided, and that the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as ObamaCare, will not bring much rationality to the system anytime soon.\n\n\n\nMy husband and I pulled into the parking lot for our first prenatal appointment 15 minutes early, excited to see the first ultrasound of the gummy-bear-sized creature in my belly. But before we laid eyes on a nurse or an ultrasound technician, the receptionist ushered us in for a meeting with a far more important person: Tami, the \u201cfinancial counselor.\u201d\n\nWe pulled in an extra chair from the waiting room and squeezed into her tiny office. Tami, a middle-aged blond woman with a soothing Southern accent, handed us a worksheet that looked like it had been photocopied in 1986 (Tami had updated it with several cross-outs and corrections). The dense paragraphs of numbers and percentages explained the $1,100 \u201cglobal fee\u201d that we had to pay up front for prenatal care and delivery. This fee, however, was not \u201cglobal\u201d enough to include hospital charges or anything else on a long list of exclusions.\n\n\u201cHow can we tell how much we\u2019ll have to pay in total, assuming it\u2019s a routine birth?\u201d my husband asked.\n\n\u201cOh, I couldn\u2019t tell you that,\u201d Tami said. Despite churning through droves of pregnant patients each year\u2014many of whom are, like me, insured by the Blue Cross Blue Shield state employee plan\u2014she had no information on what anything would ultimately cost. \u201cCall your insurance company,\u201d Tami said. \u201cAre you ready to sign the Global Agreement Contract now?\u201d\n\nA few days later, I spent twenty minutes navigating Blue Cross\u2019s automated customer service line. I finally got through to a woman who told me that the average total cost for a routine vaginal birth was $10,000. But how much of that would we have to pay?\n\n\u201cYou should look at our summary of benefits,\u201d she continued, directing me to a handy online chart of \u201ccoverage examples.\u201d The costs itemized under \u201cHaving a baby (normal delivery)\u201d didn\u2019t match the figure she quoted me. When I asked about the discrepancy, she said, \u201cWell, your actual costs may be higher,\u201d and pointed out the page\u2019s disclaimer: \u201cDon\u2019t use these examples to estimate your actual costs under this plan.\u201d I asked her how Blue Cross came up with these numbers, and whether they were relevant in any way to the hospitals in my area. She was baffled by the question; it wasn\u2019t her job to know such things.\n\nThis is the evil genius of the American insurance system. No one has any information, and no one is responsible. I was reminded of the opening scene in Franz Kafka\u2019s The Trial, when the officials who rouse Josef K. from bed to arrest him on an unexplained charge tell him they have no idea why he is under arrest: \u201cWe\u2019re lowly employees who can barely make our way through such documents,\u201d one says.\n\nOkay, I thought. Perhaps I was going about this all wrong. Instead of trying to find someone who could give me an estimate of the total cost of having this baby, I needed to break down the individual expenses on my own and collect the data that way. I began with the simplest cost I could think of, the fee for some routine blood work I had scheduled for later that month. I called my ob-gyn\u2019s office, hopeful.\n\n\u201cI have no idea what that costs,\u201d the receptionist told me. \u201cSince it goes out to a lab, it\u2019s billed by a third party. You\u2019ll have to ask your insurance.\u201d After another 10 minutes on hold with Blue Cross, I was told: \u201cSorry, those fees are confidential. We can\u2019t reveal the rates we negotiate with each provider.\u201d\n\nThe hours passed and I descended further into the underworld of hospital billing departments and voicemail boxes of cheerful-sounding women named Dana and Leanne who were perpetually out to lunch or on the other line. All are part of the growing economy of people\u2014all very nice people, I\u2019m sure\u2014who have college degrees in medical billing and coding, who make their living feeding the bureaucratic beast that cost consumers $200 billion in excess administrative fees in 2009. Much of that waste would vanish if the United States adopted a public single-payer system of the kind that most developed countries favor.\n\nAs I perused our phonebook-sized policy handbook, my eyes watered in a fog of charts, percentages, exclusions, \u201cin-network\u201d providers and \u201cprior review\u201d requirements. I learned that if a health crisis strikes our family once our child is born, Blue Cross may require that we spend as much as $20,000 a year out of pocket in \u201ccoinsurance\u201d and deductibles. But let\u2019s put aside the specter of financial ruin for a moment. The problem is not just that these costs are astronomical. It\u2019s that they are essentially secret.\n\nA truly free market requires all parties to have access to the same information\u2014and the time and expertise to interpret that information. Healthcare, by contrast, is an economy of specialized goods that most lay people don\u2019t fully understand, in which insurance companies and many healthcare providers have a vested interest in concealing prices from consumers. And I\u2019m always surprised by how few doctors seem to know the cost of treatments they prescribe. The Affordable Care Act may be better than no reform at all, but the law subsidizes this broken private insurance system. It also adds over 10,000 pages of regulations to the already byzantine bureaucracy that makes American healthcare one of the least cost-efficient in the world\u2014behind even Venezuela and Iran.\n\nI am a professional historian, which means I do research for a living. I\u2019m used to solving complex problems by gathering a lot of data and sorting through it. But in this case, there is almost no reliable data available. My husband, a Cold War historian, jokes that it\u2019s like trying to get information from the Russian archives. But at least in Moscow, a bribe or a good connection stand you a fighting chance to get what you need. There was nothing I could do to persuade Blue Cross to cough up \u201cconfidential\u201d information\u2014before I receive the final bill, of course.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Healthcare seems to be the only unpriced good in America. Most of us wouldn\u2019t even buy groceries without comparing prices first. Imagine a store with no price labels at all\u2014only the products aren\u2019t corn flakes and cantaloupe, but appendectomies and hip replacements. Even in non-emergency cases, when consumers might have the luxury of comparing hospitals rather than calling an ambulance, most of us would rather trust the advice of our doctors than shop around for, say, bargain-basement chemotherapy.\n\nIf I, with my fancy PhD and free time to spend on the phone with clerks and bureaucrats, haven\u2019t been able to figure out the cost of something as commonplace as having a baby, how must other people fare? Considering the long string of investigative articles that The New York Times and other media have published exposing the inanity and injustice of the American system, why isn\u2019t there more public outrage?", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "MollyWorthen"}, "keywords": "Women's Issues, Tech &amp; Health", "publicationDate": 201410111045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/tech-and-health", "description": "Having a baby is stressful enough, but add in the byzantine labyrinth of American medical insurers and you have a nightmare scenario straight out of Kafka.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Despite ObamaCare, U.S. Health System Still a Complete Mess", "tags": "obsessional:feminism-womens-issues,topic:sci-tech/science", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Despite ObamaCare, U.S. Health System Still a Complete Mess \",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/11/despite-obamacare-us-health-system-still-a-complete-mess.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/11/despite-obamacare-us-health-system-still-a-complete-mess/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47100810.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/11/despite-obamacare-us-health-system-still-a-complete-mess\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-10-11T10:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Tech + Health\",\"author\":\"Molly Worthen\",\"tags\":[\"feminism-womens-issues\",\"science\"]}", "news_keywords": "Womens Issues, Tech Health", "sectionTaxanomies": "tech-and-health", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Molly Worthen", "article": {"section": "science", "published_time": "2014-10-11T10:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/molly-worthenhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/11/despite-obamacare-us-health-system-still-a-complete-mess", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Having a baby is stressful enough, but add in the byzantine labyrinth of American medical insurers and you have a nightmare scenario straight out of Kafka.", "title": "Despite ObamaCare, US Health System Still a Complete Mess", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/11/despite-obamacare-us-health-system-still-a-complete-mess.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/10/11/despite-obamacare-us-health-system-still-a-complete-mess/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1413024317447.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/m/molly-worthen", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "I am a pretty healthy person and, until recently, the absurdity and expense of the American healthcare system were problems I could hold at a distance.\nThe Affordable Care Act may be better than no reform at all, but the law subsidizes this broken private insurance system.\nThis is the evil genius of the American insurance system.\nDespite churning through droves of pregnant patients each year\u2014many of whom are, like me, insured by the Blue Cross Blue Shield state employee plan\u2014she had no information on what anything would ultimately cost.\nThere was nothing I could do to persuade Blue Cross to cough up \u201cconfidential\u201d information\u2014before I receive the final bill, of course."}
