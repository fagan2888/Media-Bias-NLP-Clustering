Mike Lee (R-Utah) revealed just how much opposition he and Tea Party favorite Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) are facing within their own party as they try to change things in Washington, D.C.\n\nLee told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt about a recent closed-door meeting with Republican senators, during which he and Cruz were \u201cattacked\u201d and ridiculed. Details of the meeting were leaked to the press, but the sources of the leak were not willing to go on the record and reveal their names.\n\n\u201cNormally, I don\u2019t comment at all on closed-door meetings between Republican Senators. It\u2019s a pretty strict rule we have,\u201d Lee began, adding that someone had already released the facts of the meeting.\n\n\u201cIt was an all-out attack against Ted Cruz and me,\u201d Lee recalled. \u201cIt was unflattering. It was unfair. It was demeaning.\u201d\n\nLee said the meeting was also \u201cdemeaning to those who engaged in the attacks.\u201d The Utah Republican refused to reveal which Republicans went after him, however, he said it was enough senators that he \u201clost count.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if anyone came to his defense, Lee responded, \u201cSort of, not really.\u201d\n\nSo far, none of the GOP senators who berated Lee and Cruz have come forward to apologize.\n\nWhile Lee agreed with Hewitt on the fact that the GOP \u201cbase\u201d is \u201cthrilled\u201d with the stand he has taken against Obamacare, he said that others within the \u201cWashington, D.C. political establishment\u201d are \u201creally angry\u201d about what they are doing.\n\n\u201cI believe in forgiving and forgetting,\u201d Lee said later. \u201cI think we can get beyond that. But we need to stay focused on the goal, which is not to fight fellow Republicans, but\u2026fighting the party of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nListen to the audio via The Hugh Hewitt Show/Mediaite:\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "During an informative radio interview on Friday, Sen.
