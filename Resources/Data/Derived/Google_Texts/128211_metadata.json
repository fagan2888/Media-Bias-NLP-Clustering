The price for the stability on the legislative fiscal front is that spending for the next year will increase dramatically.\n\nCongress has already busted through the long-term budget limits to avert a shutdown this summer. The automatic, multi-year, across-the-board budget cuts, called sequestration in Washington, were adopted in 2011, soon after the Republicans took control of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe sequestration cuts, criticized by most on the left and by several defense-hawks on the right, did bring spending down lower than it would otherwise have been and trimmed the size of annual budget deficits. This summer\u2019s budget deal, negotiated in the final days of Speaker John Boehner\u2019s tenure, reversed the spending cuts in exchange for promised budget savings in the future.\n\nThe new spending bill, set to be approved by Congress in the next 10 days, will operate without the sequestration cuts and will carry government spending through the end of next year. The spending bill, then, will also be one of the last implemented by the President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\n\nCongressional Republicans, to avoid any threat of a shutdown, seem poised to fund Obama\u2019s full agenda for his remaining year in office. This funding currently includes, even, Obama\u2019s funding request to resettle 10,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq within the United States.\n\n\u201cNot only will the President be allowed to bring in the 85,000 refugees he has announced on top of current record immigration levels, but this will include at least 10,000 refugees from Syria who will subsequently be able to bring in their foreign relatives,\u201d Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cAll refugees are eligible for lifetime government assistance and can draw funds from Social Security and Medicare at Americans\u2019 expense. More than 90% of recent Middle Eastern refugees are on welfare. And they are on a fast-track to becoming voting U.S. citizens.\u201d\n\nSessions also pointed out that the spending plan being drafted by Republican leadership would also fully fund \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d where federal immigration laws aren\u2019t enforced, as well as Obama\u2019s executive directives providing amnesty, as well as an expansion of work-related visas.\n\nConservatives have discussed blocking funding for the resettlement program as part of the omnibus spending package.\n\nRepublican leaders seem unlikely to push items that might invite a presidential veto and risk a government shutdown. \u201cI hear a lot of things on the omni on a lot of different aspects,\u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said. \u201cI do not hear people shutting the government down.\u201d\n\nWith the threat of a government shutdown presumably off the table, other controversial proposals to block spending as part of the omnibus are increasingly unlikely. In addition to the Syrian refugee resettlement program, the budget will likely continue funding for Planned Parenthood and implementation of ObamaCare.\n\nIt looks likely that President Obama will close his presidential term with no major setbacks to the policies he has enacted or authorized through executive orders. His final year in office will be marked by a federal budget that largely funds his administration\u2019s priorities.\n\nThe fight over Obama\u2019s legacy will apparently have to wait until he is out of the White House.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Speaker Paul Ryan and other GOP leaders in Congress are putting the final touches on a massive omnibus spending bill.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "House Speaker Paul Ryan and other GOP leaders in Congress are putting the final touches on a massive omnibus spending bill.", "title": "GOP Congress, Speaker Paul Ryan, Push Obama-Approved 2016 Spending Bill", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/house-speaker-paul-ryan-majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-press-conference-AP.jpg", "height": 960}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/01/gop-congress-speaker-paul-ryan-push-obama-approved-2016-spending-bill/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Speaker Paul Ryan and other GOP leaders in Congress are putting the final touches on a massive omnibus spending bill.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/house-speaker-paul-ryan-majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-press-conference-AP.jpg", "title": "GOP Congress, Speaker Paul Ryan, Push Obama-Approved 2016 Spending Bill", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Amnesty, budget, Congress, Establishment GOP, Executive Action, government shutdown, Government Spending, House Majority Leader, House of Representatives, immigration, Jeff Sessions, John Boehner, Kevin McCarthy, Majority Leader, National Debt, obamacare, Paul Ryan, Planned Parenthood, presidential veto, Sanctuary Cities, sequestration, speaker of the house, Spending bill, Syrian refugees, Visas,Big Government, Economics, Obama,spending bill", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Visas", "published_time": "2015-12-01T21:48:38-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obama,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Congress must pass the appropriations bill by December 11th, when current funding spending authority expires, to avert a government shutdown.\nThe spending bill, then, will also be one of the last implemented by the President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\nThe new spending bill, set to be approved by Congress in the next 10 days, will operate without the sequestration cuts and will carry government spending through the end of next year.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHouse Speaker Paul Ryan and other Republican leaders in Congress are putting the final touches on a massive omnibus spending bill that will fund the federal government until after the presidential election.\nThis funding currently includes, even, Obama\u2019s funding request to resettle 10,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq within the United States."}
