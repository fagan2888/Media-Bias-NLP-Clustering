(Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP)\n\nNevada no longer leads the nation in uninsured children.\n\nThe Silver State posted the largest improvement nationwide in reducing its rate of uninsured kids from 2013 to 2014, a report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found.\n\nAn estimated 100,058 or 14.4 percent of Nevada children did not have health insurance in 2013, a rate that ranked 51st \u2014 or dead last \u2014 among all states and Washington, D.C. that year. By 2014, however, Nevada improved to 48th as its rate fell to 10 percent or about 69,300 uninsured children. The 4.4 percentage point reduction also represented the biggest improvement in the nation, according to the report, which was done by the University of Minnesota and uses the latest numbers available from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nNevada\u2019s improvement coincided with a nationwide increase in kids gaining insurance.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest decline of uninsured kids we have seen since (we started doing the annual study in) 2008,\u201d said Brett Fried, a senior research fellow with the University of Minnesota\u2019s State Health Access Data Assistance Center.\n\nAlthough the study did not specifically look at causes for the improvement in insurance coverage, Fried says the trend matches findings by other reports about the impact of the Affordable Care Act, which kicked off its first year of open enrollment in October 1, 2013. In addition to launching qualified health plan for individuals and families, the ACA also expanded coverage through Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely the case that more children gained coverage as eligible parents signed up for free or low-cost health insurance, and we\u2019re likely to see that continue,\u201d said Lynn Blewett, director of the State Health Access Data Assistance Center.\n\nThe improvement was welcomed by Gov. Brian Sandoval, who pointed out that Nevada led the nation in reducing its per capita rate for the uninsured as well. In addition to children, the state also has made gains in increasing coverage for vulnerable populations, Sandoval said.\n\n\"This drop in our uninsured rate has helped children across Nevada as well as the neediest among our communities by leveraging federal resources and saving precious state dollars,\" Sandoval said.\n\nSeeing progress\n\nThe data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation backs up the gains seen among vulnerable populations and minorities.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing about Nevada is that it saw a large drop in the percent of Hispanic children that were uninsured and also for low-income children,\u201d Fried said.\n\nLow-income kids saw the biggest improvement in Nevada with a 7.5 percentage point reduction in uninsured children. Minorities saw a 4.5 percentage point reduction, with Hispanics posting a decrease of 5.5 percentage points.\n\nThe reductions in a state that has struggled with its rate of uninsured for many years is a big deal, said Kathy Hempstead, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation director of insurance coverage issues.\n\n\u201cLast year, we again marked progress in efforts to expand health insurance coverage to all children in Nevada,\u201d Hempstead said. \u201cExpanding eligibility and enrolling the eligible must continue until all of the estimated 69,000 uninsured children in Nevada can get access to coverage.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the state still has a ways to go. Despite its improvement, Nevada remains among the bottom five of states for its rate of uninsured children, behind only Alaska, Texas and Arizona. Florida rounded out the bottom five.\n\nSandoval says he's aware that more work needs to be done.\n\n\"I remain committed to working with our state an federal partners to continue improving access to healthcare services,\" Sandoval said.\n\nNevada should continue to see improvement in 2015 and this year as well based on ACA enrollment numbers, said Bruce Gilbert, executive director of the Silver State Health Insurance Exchange. The second year\u2019s enrollment numbers for qualified health plans in Nevada, for example, doubled those of the first year. This year saw even bigger enrollment numbers for qualified health plans.\n\n\u201cWe saw a significant increase with 88,145 Nevadans enrolling in health plans through the exchange,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cThat\u2019s an increase of about 20 percent.\u201d\n\nState of the state exchange\n\nThe last enrollment period marked a redemption of sorts for Nevada\u2019s health insurance exchange program.\n\nThe state exchange\u2019s launch was marred by generous expectations and technical glitches from provider Xerox, which snowballed into all sorts of problems.\n\nThe latest enrollment numbers are a big improvement from the first year of the Nevada Health Link site, which saw only 35,000 signups for qualified health plans after initially posting a goal of 118,000 enrollments.\n\n\u201cIn the first year, everything went about as poorly as they could,\u201d said Gilbert, who became director during the second year. \u201cThe technology failed, the consumers weren\u2019t happy and the broker-agent community was unhappy.\u201d\n\nThe health exchange blowup was particularly vexing for Sandoval, who went ahead with the exchange after it became \u201cthe law of the land\u201d despite its unpopularity in conservative circles where it continues to be labeled as \u201cObamacare.\u201d After the failure of Xerox\u2019s system, Nevada dumped the company and switched to a hybrid exchange that piggybacks on the federal system.\n\nAlthough switching to a federal system gave the state exchange stability, it also come with its share of drawbacks. One is lack of direct access to data and analytics, which the state has to request from the federal government.\n\n\u201c(Information sharing is) a heavy lift,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cThe downside of utilizing federal technology is that we\u2019re held captive by decision makers in Washington as to what information is important or essential and what is not.\u201d\n\nThe state is also waiting for a final proposal from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for how much it will cost Nevada to remain on the federal system. Depending on the result, combined with the limitations of information sharing, Nevada could very well opt out and contract with the private sector for its own system again.\n\nThe difference this time is there are now systems out there with a proven track record, which should prevent a Xerox 2.0 situation, Gilbert said.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t 2012 anymore so we\u2019re not interested in building Frankenstein\u2019s monster from scratch again,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cThe real challenge this time is going to be one of perception rather than technology.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the state exchange plans to build on its outreach efforts from the last two years. This includes increased focus on Latinos, tribes and other minorities as well as self-employed and low-income populations.\n\n\u201cThose are the really hot-button populations for us because they create the most opportunities to make a difference,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cWe\u2019ll also look at the last enrollment period and try to better identify which messaging works and what events work in reaching the populations that really benefit the most from our activities.\u201d\n\nTOP 5 STATES (lowest % of uninsured children)\n\nVermont: 1.2 percent\n\nMassachusetts: 1.8 percent\n\nHawaii: 2.5 percent\n\nDistrict of Columbia: 2.7 percent\n\nIowa: 3.2 percent\n\nBOTTOM 5 STATES (highest % of uninsured children)\n\nAlaska: 12.3 percent\n\nTexas: 11.8 percent\n\nArizona: 10.5 percent\n\nNevada: 10 percent\n\nFlorida: 9.6 percent\n\nSource: University of Minnesota State Health Access Data Assistance Center\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.rgj.com/1oY9InR", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Increased coverage for Hispanics, low-income children via Affordable Care Act drive improvement in Nevada\u2019s rate of insured kids..", "og": {"site_name": "Reno Gazette Journal", "description": "Increased coverage for Hispanics, low-income children via Affordable Care Act drive improvement in Nevada\u2019s rate of insured kids..", "title": "Nevada posts biggest drop nationwide in rate of uninsured kids", "url": "http://www.rgj.com/story/news/2016/03/02/nevada-posts-biggest-drop-nationwide-rate-uninsured-kids/81173126/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/rgj.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Increased coverage for Hispanics, low-income children via Affordable Care Act drive improvement in Nevada\u2019s rate of insured kids..", "title": "Nevada posts biggest drop nationwide in rate of uninsured kids", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a37cccae157009d874ebc6936ca9fcc09a8abce6/c=822-0-4109-3287&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/22/RenoGroup/RGJ/635811290243455136-Health-Overhaul-Websi-Hida.jpg", "creator": "@rgj", "site": "@rgj", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=805729789", "fb": {"app_id": 178959168788968}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/jasonhidalgo.journalist"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "nevada uninsured kids, nevada uninsured kids rate, nevada uninsured kids stats, nevada uninsured kids aca, nevada uninsured kids obamacare, nevada health link"}, "article_summary": "Low-income kids saw the biggest improvement in Nevada with a 7.5 percentage point reduction in uninsured children.\nBy 2014, however, Nevada improved to 48th as its rate fell to 10 percent or about 69,300 uninsured children.\nDespite its improvement, Nevada remains among the bottom five of states for its rate of uninsured children, behind only Alaska, Texas and Arizona.\nIn this Oct. 6, 2015 file photo, the HealthCare.gov website, where people can buy health insurance, is displayed on a laptop screen.\n(Photo: Andrew Harnik, AP)Nevada no longer leads the nation in uninsured children."}
