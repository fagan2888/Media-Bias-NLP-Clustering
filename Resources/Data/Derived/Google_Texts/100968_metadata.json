With Bruno Mars singing \u201cYou can count on me like 1, 2, 3\u201d in the background, the father saves his kid from increasingly dangerous calamities: he steps in front of his son to take the errant pinata hit; he jumps in moments before his boy reaches a lit barbeque while trying to catch a pass.\n\nIn the highly gendered world of advertising, the ability to anticipate a child\u2019s needs used to lie squarely in female territory. Now, it\u2019s called \u201cDad\u2019s Sixth Sense,\u201d according to the title of Hyundai\u2019s ad, and it\u2019s just one example of how the image of men in ads is softening and how the once-crisp lines of masculinity have blurred.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t have found this kind of dad a few years ago. Now, of the 19 Super Bowl commercials released at the time of writing, three feature a father engaging with his child meaningfully and four others show men caring for another person or animal (or muppet).\n\nMen make more household purchases than before so advertisers are trying to find ways to tap the changing market \u2014 and it turns out the stoic hero, the bumbling idiot, they don\u2019t always work so well. As a result, advertisers are cautiously stepping away from some of those archetypes.\n\n\u201cTen years ago, there were clear lines, blue and pink,\u201d said Gary Hayward, who represents Bombay Sapphire. \u201cThe gender gap is not as clear as it used to be.\u201d\n\nIn terms of advertising, there is no bigger venue than the Super Bowl, which is expected to beat the president\u2019s State of the Union address viewership by at least 78 million people (a difference that is greater than the entire populations of California and Texas combined). So it\u2019s tempting to say a softened male on this big a stage is a huge leap for this country. But critics say these ads aren\u2019t an indication of a real shift in gender politics. After all, these guys aren\u2019t exactly cleaning up after a sick child, washing dishes or folding laundry. And the odds that we will see a single father or a gay couple on this country\u2019s holiest sports days any time soon? A long shot.\n\nThe ads are \u201cpretty much saying you do need to attract a woman, you need to be a heterosexual male to be valuable,\u201d said Imran Siddiquee, communications director for the Representation Project, a feminist group that critiques sexist ads. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much it really encourages young boys and girls to think differently. I don\u2019t know how much it really allows us to be outside the box.\u201d\n\nStill, it makes sense that men are increasingly portrayed as caregivers. In the last few years, some statistics indicate they have assumed greater roles in families. The number of stay-at-home dads has more than doubled from roughly 90,000 in 2000 to almost 190,000 in 2012, according to census data. And dads have taken on shopping, according to a detailed study by Defy Media called the Acumen Report that will be unveiled in the upcoming months. The media group shared some of their findings from the survey of more than 2,000 men, ages 18 to 49. More than 65 percent said they shop for household items. Of the married men, more than half said they, and not their wives, select what brands to buy. Nearly 57 percent said they would stop buying from a company that did something offensive or illegal and 60 percent said they bought something because it was made locally. Only 30 percent indicated that they responded to a product that was endorsed by a celebrity or an athlete.\n\nThese results imply there\u2019s a certain amount of thought going on when a guy shops. He seems aware of how products fit into the world and how his choice plays into that dynamic. And because the male market is clearly showing greater influence in the home and correspondingly in the stores, companies are trying to figure out how to reach these guys in a way that resonates with their conscientiousness. But advertisers don\u2019t always get it right. In a 2012 study by the same company, men said that they couldn\u2019t relate to the women-chasing, metrosexual or macho men in ads.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This year's ads show involved dads and devoted partners.
