But the anxiety provoked by the incident extends far beyond that neighborhood as parents naturally wonder just how safe schools are and what might be done to make them safer.\n\nMost students are out of class this week for the holidays. Will they be heading back in January to facilities that are inviting targets of deranged malcontents?\n\nShould parents worry?\n\nThe reality is that schools are, for the most part, the safe havens the public has every right to expect. And crime statistics bear this out.\n\nDon\u2019t misunderstand: It\u2019s imperative that school districts implement effective safety measures, although those may vary from district to district and even from school to school.\n\nIt is also important that everyone in a school be trained to handle a crisis.\n\nIn that regard, the Arapahoe student body and staff appeared well prepared to respond to this month\u2019s attack. And an armed deputy reached the shooter within two minutes, a remarkable feat that very likely saved lives.\n\nCould more be done? Perhaps, but it\u2019s also important to ask at what point security interferes with a school\u2019s mission.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let our schools become fortified castles or military installations,\u201d Gov. John Hickenlooper told Colorado Public Radio the other day. \u201cIt\u2019s a place for learning and for ideas and for children.\u201d\n\nHickenlooper recognizes that schools, by and large, are already comparatively safe places.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the number of kids who die in accidental deaths in swimming pools, [it is] far more than die in shootings,\u201d Hickenlooper said. \u201cBut somehow the shootings are so visceral and affect us \u2026 so deeply.\u201d\n\nHickenlooper is right. As NBC reported recently, \u201cAn average of 23 youths per year were the victims of homicides at elementary or secondary schools or on the way to a school event, over the years 1992 to 2011.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, nearly 140 children drowned in pools and spas in the summer of 2012, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n\nAnd while experts argue over whether school shootings are more frequent in recent decades, NBC reports that \u201cfederal surveys suggest that school violence has decreased dramatically over the past thirty years.\u201d\n\nThat would make sense, since crime rates generally have declined.\n\nJust two years ago, the National Center for Education Statistics took an in-depth look at school violence. \u201cIn each year during the period 1992-93 to 2006-07,\u201d the center concluded, \u201cthere were at least 50 times as many homicides of youth away from school than at school and generally at least 150 times as many suicides of youth away from school than at school. During the 2007-08 school year, there was approximately one homicide or suicide of a school-age youth at school per 2.1 million students enrolled.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve been trying to tell people all weekend is that this [sort of shooting] happens once in a blue moon,\u201d Hickenlooper told CPR. That\u2019s not an argument for complacency, but it is a call for perspective and for calm.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Keeping perspective on school violence", "title": "Keeping perspective on school violence", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/20/keeping-perspective-on-school-violence/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131220__20131223_Z00_OP23E_HICKRISKp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131220__20131223_Z00_OP23E_HICKRISKp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-20T17:16:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T12:00:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc5d\"", "article_summary": "Just two years ago, the National Center for Education Statistics took an in-depth look at school violence.\nDon\u2019t misunderstand: It\u2019s imperative that school districts implement effective safety measures, although those may vary from district to district and even from school to school.\nAnd while experts argue over whether school shootings are more frequent in recent decades, NBC reports that \u201cfederal surveys suggest that school violence has decreased dramatically over the past thirty years.\u201dThat would make sense, since crime rates generally have declined.\n\u201cIf you look at the number of kids who die in accidental deaths in swimming pools, [it is] far more than die in shootings,\u201d Hickenlooper said.\nBut the anxiety provoked by the incident extends far beyond that neighborhood as parents naturally wonder just how safe schools are and what might be done to make them safer."}
