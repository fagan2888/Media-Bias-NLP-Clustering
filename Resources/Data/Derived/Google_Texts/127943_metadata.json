Additionally, 40 percent of respondents said they believe they pay more than their fair share, up from 38 percent in 2011.\n\nHowever, the number of Republicans who complained they pay more than their fair share jumped 13 percentage points, from 37 percent to 50 percent, while the share of Democrats who think they pay too much fell to 30 percent from 38 percent. (Interestingly, in 2011, slightly more Democrats than Republicans believed that they were paying more than their fair share.)\n\nAsked how much they\u2019re concerned by certain things about the tax code, a majority of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents all cited corporate tax avoidance as something that bothers them \u201ca lot.\u201d Seventy-five percent of Democrats, 64 percent of Independents, and 52 percent of Republicans said they are bothered by \u201cthe feeling that some corporations don\u2019t pay their fair share.\u201d\n\nDemocrats (72 percent) and Independents (63 percent) were almost as bothered by the \u201cfeeling that some wealthy people don\u2019t pay their fair share.\u201d Republicans were somewhat less concerned, with 45 percent saying it bothers them \u201ca lot.\u201d One in three Republicans said they were bothered a lot by the feeling that poor people don\u2019t pay their fair share of taxes, but only 14 percent of Democrats and 17 percent of Independents felt that way.\n\nSLIDESHOW: The 10 Worst States for Paying Taxes in 2015\n\nNone of the three major political groups could muster a majority of members who were very bothered by the amount they personally pay in taxes. Republicans were most concerned, with 36 percent citing serious concern. Among Democrats and Independents, 21 percent and 25 percent, respectively, said their personal tax liability bothers them a lot.\n\nHowever, the personal finance website WalletHub says that taxpayers who need some last-minute assistance from the Internal Revenue Service might find something to irritate them. Wait times for callers to the IRS average 28 minutes at the underfunded, understaffed agency. And the IRS\u2019s staffing issues don\u2019t just mean annoyed taxpayers. The agency expects to lose some $2 billion in revenue this year because it doesn\u2019t have enough enforcement staff.\n\nPresident Obama this week has a series of appearances and interviews in which he is expected to discuss tax policy and highlight his difference with Republicans over issues such as equal pay for women and family-friendly workplace policies.\n\nIn Congress, House Republicans are expected to move forward with a vote on repealing the estate tax. The law, long hated by the GOP, applies a graduated tax on assets after an individual\u2019s death, capped at 40 percent. However, the first $5.4 million of an estate is tax free. This means that only a tiny percentage of all estates in the U.S. are actually subject to an estate tax.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With Tax Day nearly here, a new poll from the Pew Research Center finds that 57 percent of Americans believe they pay either the right amount of taxes \u2013 or something less than their fair share.
