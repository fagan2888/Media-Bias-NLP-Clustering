This increased patent bill opposition is directed at Republican lawmakers, the political majority party in both houses of Congress, though patent issues don\u2019t fall along party lines.\n\nWith House leadership deciding to postpone H.R. 9\u2019s floor debate until at least September, the expanded conservative opposition seems to be effective.\n\nThe American Conservative Union, Club for Growth, and Eagle Forum have launched advertising that focuses on the House patent litigation bill, H.R. 9. The ad has appeared in the Washington Post and the Washington Times. The ad has drawn attention to the legislation in a more public way, focusing on the potential for harm to independent inventors.\n\nAlso, the Heritage Foundation think tank has produced a paper analyzing the policy issues related to pending legislation in light of recent developments concerning patent litigation, such as the Octane Fitness decision and the Judicial Conference recommendation to do away with Form 18. The Heritage paper cautions against sweeping measures that could upset the innovation ecosystem, given recent developments and so soon on the heels of the America Invents Act.\n\nThe political action arm of Heritage, Heritage Action, has now declared its opposition to H.R. 9.\n\nLast week, ACU, Eagle Forum, Heritage and others briefed congressional staff on patent legislation. The Capitol Hill event featured remarks by conservative Members of Congress, Congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) and Congressman Thomas Massie (R-KY). Both lawmakers have led the opposition on the GOP side of the House.\n\nThe briefers discussed patents as property rights, the excessive provisions of H.R. 9, the changed patent litigation environment, and the harm the legislation would do to patent owners and inventors. Also noted was the constitutional enumeration of inventors\u2019 exclusive right to their discoveries. The briefing drew a full room, with staff from rank-and-file offices and the House leadership.\n\nRaising conservative concerns about the patent bill by highlighting principled perspectives has expanded the range of the opposition. These voices join universities, IP-intensive businesses, inventors, investors and others, from a noncommercial point of view. And several of the conservative organizations have alerted Congress that they will count the H.R. 9 vote in their ratings of Members of Congress.\n\nSeveral conservative groups, including Eagle Forum and ACU, have endorsed less sweeping, more focused legislation as an alternative \u2014 a move that has been helpful. The TROL Act, which passed the House Energy and Commerce Committee, addresses the matter of abusive demand letter practices. Rather than upending patent litigation procedures and assuming all plaintiffs are \u201ctrolls,\u201d this bill deals with demand-letter bulk mailing to mom-and-pop retail stores under consumer protection laws.\n\nThe escalation of concern from the political right has gotten the attention of more and more GOP lawmakers, including many who voted for the Innovation Act in the previous Congress. These representatives have steadily relayed those concerns to their colleagues and their party leaders in closed-door meetings.\n\n______________\n\nFollowing are the Ad and Original Press Release:\n\nCONSERVATIVE GROUPS LAUNCH ADVERTISING BLITZ TO STOP GOP PATENT LEGISLATION: \u201cCHINA LOVES IT, INVENTORS FEAR IT, AND THE FOUNDING FATHERS WOULD HAVE HATED IT\u201d\n\nWASHINGTON, DC: The American Conservative Union, Club for Growth and Eagle Forum launched an advertising campaign today against GOP patent legislation (HR-9) that will harm American inventors and small business, while giving a \u201cbig assist to China\u201d in the global marketplace.\n\n\u201cThe patent legislation working its way through Congress is harmful to American innovation, inventors and small businesses. HR-9 weakens patents and property rights as guaranteed in our Constitution. And it gives a big assist to China in the global marketplace,\u201d said Dan Schneider, Executive Director of the American Conservative Union. \u201cWe\u2019ve yet to see any of President Obama\u2019s massive overhaul proposals to produce good results. We don\u2019t think this latest effort will be any better than Obamacare,\u201d he added.\n\nThe groups\u2019 ad campaign begins Monday with full-page ads in both The Washington Post and The Washington Times along with a comprehensive digital advertising campaign throughout the week. A vote on HR-9 is expected in the House the week of July 20th. Even if passed the bill faces a steep challenge in the Senate.\n\n\u201cOur economy is still struggling. We have had one of the worst post recession recoveries in American history and we continue to teeter on the brink of another recession. The American people need Congress to promote and pass pro-growth policies that help American innovation, not harm it. This legislation is anti-growth and stifles innovation. The timing could not be worse,\u201d said David McIntosh, President of the Club for Growth. \u201cThe American people did not give the GOP a majority in both Houses of Congress in 2014 so they could pass laws that harm American ingenuity and economic growth,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThis legislation undermines the Constitutional rights of American inventors and is destructive to future innovation. HR-9 helps China and hurts the United States, and the many innovators who continue to invent life saving products and devices. China\u2019s weak patent system has led to rampant abuse and stealing of many American inventions. The GOP is pushing legislation that weakens our patent system and emulates China\u2019s. This is both bad policy and bad politics,\u201d said Phyllis Schlafly, Founder and President of Eagle Forum.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Leading organizations of the Conservative Movement have informed Congress of the philosophical reasons for increased patent bill opposition.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law", "description": "Leading organizations of the Conservative Movement have informed Congress of the philosophical reasons for increased patent bill opposition.", "title": "Conservative Groups Upping Patent Bill Opposition - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 335, "identifier": "http://www.ipwatchdog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/flag-constiution-and-gavel-335-x-223.jpeg", "height": 223}, "updated_time": "2015-08-14T10:35:01-04:00", "url": "http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2015/08/02/conservative-groups-upping-patent-bill-opposition/id=60170/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.ipwatchdog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/flag-constiution-and-gavel-335-x-223.jpeg", "description": "Leading organizations of the Conservative Movement have informed Congress of the philosophical reasons for increased patent bill opposition.", "card": "summary", "title": "Conservative Groups Upping Patent Bill Opposition - IPWatchdog.com | Patents & Patent Law"}, "robots": "noodp", "article": {"section": "Capitol Hill", "tag": "USPTO", "published_time": "2015-08-02T07:30:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-14T10:35:01-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc8a\"", "article_summary": "The American Conservative Union, Club for Growth, and Eagle Forum have launched advertising that focuses on the House patent litigation bill, H.R.\n9\u2019s floor debate until at least September, the expanded conservative opposition seems to be effective.\nAnd it gives a big assist to China in the global marketplace,\u201d said Dan Schneider, Executive Director of the American Conservative Union.\nThis increased patent bill opposition is directed at Republican lawmakers, the political majority party in both houses of Congress, though patent issues don\u2019t fall along party lines.\nLast week, ACU, Eagle Forum, Heritage and others briefed congressional staff on patent legislation."}
