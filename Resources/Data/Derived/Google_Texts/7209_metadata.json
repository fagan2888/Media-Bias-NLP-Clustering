Students in Hutch say drugs aren't hard to find at school.\n\n\"I don't hear about LSD but weed and pills yeah,\" says Demetrius Vansyckle.\n\n\"All you have to do is ask who you see first and I'm sure they'll get it to you somehow,\" adds Krinn Stutzman.\n\nStudents in Hutch tell KAKE News they never noticed the officer, but once the news broke in Buhler, students like Kylee Ingalls say it's been the talk around school.\n\n\"We're all just kind of telling stories like 'oh he was in this class, he was in this class,' it was just kind of like a cool thing that's never happened here before,\" she says.\n\nIngalls says one of her classmates was arrested which was surprising for two reasons. It was someone she never would've expected, with a drug she didn't know was going around Buhler.\n\n\"I heard it was LSD,\" she says. \"So kind of a pretty big deal. I mean, I know a few people that do marijuana here of course just like anywhere so I was pretty surprised at that.\n\nIngalls says it's a good thing the undercover officer came to these schools before the problem got any worse.\n\n\"It's kind of sad that we've realized that stuff was going on, but we're glad that he caught whoever it was and hopefully is getting help.\"\n\nJonathon Thiessen, 21, and Jaeden Kidd, 19, were both were jailed on $5,000 bonds. The names of the four minors arrested have not been released.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Students at Hutchinson, Nickerson, and Buhler thought they had a new classmate, but it turns out he was an undercover officer with the Reno County Sheriff's Department to crack down on drugs.", "language": "english", "author": "Ben Jordan", "og": {"description": "Students at Hutchinson, Nickerson, and Buhler thought they had a new classmate, but it turns out he was an undercover officer with the Reno County Sheriff's Department to crack down on drugs.", "title": "Students react to undercover drug bust at Reno County schools", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Students-react-to-undercover-drug-bust-at-Reno-Co-schools-297149011.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/28C/546/28C54623EF844BC7912CD6BAF1463F84", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/501/C90/501C908AC68644C9AABAC352552A06BE.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Students at Hutchinson, Nickerson, and Buhler thought they had a new classmate, but it turns out he was an undercover officer with the Reno County Sheriff's Department to crack down on drugs.", "title": "Students react to undercover drug bust at Reno County schools", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Students-react-to-undercover-drug-bust-at-Reno-Co-schools-297149011.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/thiessen+kidd.png", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Students react to undercover drug bust at Reno County schools", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Students react to undercover drug, bust at Reno County schools"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e3c\"", "article_summary": "Ingalls says it's a good thing the undercover officer came to these schools before the problem got any worse.\nStudents at Hutchinson, Nickerson, and Buhler thought they had a new classmate, but it turns out he was an undercover officer with the Reno County Sheriff's Department to crack down on drugs.\nStudents in Hutch say drugs aren't hard to find at school.\nStudents in Hutch tell KAKE News they never noticed the officer, but once the news broke in Buhler, students like Kylee Ingalls say it's been the talk around school.\nIt was someone she never would've expected, with a drug she didn't know was going around Buhler."}
