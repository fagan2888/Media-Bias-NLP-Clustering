That was the case for all three of Force\u2019s daughters.\n\nOn Saturday, his daughters Courtney and Brittany continue to race. Courtney faces off against her father in the Funny Car class and Brittany races in the Top Fuel Dragster category.\n\nCourtney said she enjoys coming to Bandimere Speedway because of the unique challenge the elevation presents to the drivers and crew chiefs.\n\nShe\u2019s visited the track as a competitor and a racer. But her favorite memory is hanging out in the grandstands with her animal crackers and lemonade watching her dad compete. It kicked off the start of her summer and was the first NHRA race out West.\n\nCurrently, Courtney sits sixth in the Funny Car standings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been good for our Traxxas team,\u201d Courtney said. \u201cWe\u2019re staying in the top 10 in points. It\u2019s definitely tough making it in the top 10 right now.\u201d\n\nOn May 25, Courtney became the 100th woman to win an NHRA event. Courtney is among the many women thriving this year in the NHRA.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bandimere Speedway,Courtney Force,NHRA", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Colorado Sports", "description": "When your dad is John Force, one of the best racers in the National Hot Rod Association, it's pretty likely that you're going to race.
