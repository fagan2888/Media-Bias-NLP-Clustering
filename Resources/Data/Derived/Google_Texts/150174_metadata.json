Why wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d asks Fleming. \u201cHaving their children admitted is a government-sponsored guarantee of a golden ticket to life: college at taxpayer expense with no student debts, the highest salary of any set of graduates, and guaranteed employment and (no-Obamacare-necessary) health benefits for at least five years, frequently well beyond. And no, most people in the military aren\u2019t remotely likely to be shot at.\u201d\n\nIn trying to correlate what he believes to be a hypocritical set of principles, Fleming taunts conservatives' disdain for social welfare, writing \u201cthe service academies are the most generous government giveaway going.\u201d According to his op-ed, all the military academies care about is \u201cfunnel the money to us and don\u2019t ask questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe service academies are all Potemkin villages, facades with nothing behind them: they don\u2019t teach morals, they don\u2019t make better officers, and they cost you a bundle,\u201d writes Fleming. \u201cMost fundamentally, they combine two incompatible goals: military obedience and the freedom to question offered by knowledge.\u201d\n\nFleming concludes by clarifying that he is in fact \u201cin support of [the academy\u2019s] mission\u201d but refers to himself as a \u201cdisillusioned former True Believer.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople fawn over you in your spiffy uniform in airports, and thank you \u2018for your service.\u2019 Liberals are scared to object for fear of seeming anti-military. And you\u2019re the Ken dolls of the conservatives.\u201d\n\nFleming has long been a tenacious critic of military practices. As reported by The Daily Mail and The Washington Post, the Naval Academy threatened to silence Fleming back in November after he made \u201cdisparaging comments about the school\u2019s sexual assault prevention training.\u201d\n\nFollow the author of this article on Twitter: @MaggieLitCRO", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6179/U.S.NavalAcademy.jpg", "description": "\"The service academies are all Potemkin villages, facades with nothing behind them: they don\u2019t teach morals, they don\u2019t make better officers, and they cost you a bundle.\"", "og": {"site_name": "Campus Reform", "description": "\"The service academies are all Potemkin villages, facades with nothing behind them: they don\u2019t teach morals, they don\u2019t make better officers, and they cost you a bundle.\"", "title": "Naval professor asks Congress to defund military colleges", "url": "http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=6179", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6179/U.S.NavalAcademy.jpg", "height": 600}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "image": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6179/U.S.NavalAcademy.jpg", "fb": {"admins": 19226500, "app_id": 127484367480}, "keywords": ",Military, Naval Academy, Air Force Academy, West Point, Coast Guard Academy, Maggie Lit", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CampusReform", "description": "\"The service academies are all Potemkin villages, facades with nothing behind them: they don\u2019t teach morals, they don\u2019t make better officers, and they cost you a bundle.\""}, "twitter": {"description": "Naval professor asks Congress to defund military colleges", "card": "http://www.campusreform.org/img/CROBlog/6179/U.S.NavalAcademy.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd912f\"", "article_summary": "\"The service academies are all Potemkin villages, facades with nothing behind them: they don\u2019t teach morals, they don\u2019t make better officers, and they cost you a bundle.\"\nFleming claims that while the service academies once had a purpose, they are no longer relevant, are \u201cunderproductive,\u201d and exist only to drain the pockets of the taxpayers.\nAnd you\u2019re the Ken dolls of the conservatives.\u201dFleming has long been a tenacious critic of military practices.\n\u201c[T]here\u2019s one more group of people who defend these places to the death: the parents of the young military members who attend them.\nThe professor claims that the main supporters of these institutions\u2014which he alleges falsely boast having \u201cthe best and the brightest\u201d\u2014are parents who attended the academies themselves."}
