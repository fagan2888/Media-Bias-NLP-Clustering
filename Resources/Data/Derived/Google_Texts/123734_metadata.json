This connects the acorn and the oak of the progressive welfare state \u2014 the development of a federal \u201cpolice power.\u201d The power to regulate the \u201csafety, health, welfare, and morals\u201d of the people, traditionally reserved to the states, became a national power.\n\nToday\u2019s liberals trace their origins to the early 20th-century progressives, and nominal Republican Theodore Roosevelt was their first leader.

Much of the pure-food agitation arose from attempts to eliminate competition from food substitutes, as when dairy farmers tried to drive oleomargarine from the market.

Cream-of-tartar producers sought to demonize acid-based or alum baking powders. As recounted by business-ethics professor Donna Wood, the Royal Baking Company, for example, \u201cdenounced alum as a dangerous drug, pictured phosphate as being made from old bones covered with vitriol, and appealed to mothers to protect their families\u2019 health by using \u2018pure cream of tartar baking powder,\u2019\u201d and \u201cfalsely reported that an entire Pennsylvania family had died from eating bread made with a competitor\u2019s baking powder.\u201d The balance of these various interests, along with those who doubted the public purpose or constitutionality of federal pure-food legislation, stymied congressional efforts.\n\nMuckraking journalists helped to sensationalize the issue.

Probably because they had never seen a slaughterhouse before, they largely affirmed Sinclair\u2019s horrific account, and Roosevelt used the threat of its publication to get the packers and their congressional allies to come to terms. Congress hammered out a compromise bill as to who would pay for the inspections, the dating of canned meat, the civil-service status of the inspectors, and judicial review, and passed a meat-inspection bill and Pure Food and Drugs bill on the last day of June 1906. Senator Albert Beveridge, an Indiana Republican and leading progressive proponent of the act, hailed it as \u201cthe most pronounced extension of federal power in every direction ever enacted.\u201d\n\nConservatives a century ago, as today, hoped that the Supreme Court would check the excesses of the other two federal branches. But the Court unanimously upheld the Pure Food and Drugs Act in 1911. Justice Joseph McKenna emphasized that the inherently harmful nature of the prohibited products obscured the police-power boundary. \u201cWe are dealing, it must be remembered, with illicit articles . . . outlaws of commerce,\u201d he called them. McKenna highlighted the genuine public or consumer-welfare impetus and benefits from these acts but overlooked those that betrayed special-interest or \u201cclass legislation.\u201d\n\nIn the next significant step in the development of a federal police power, the Mann \u201cWhite Slave Traffic\u201d Act, muckraking hysteria provided the preponderant impetus, with the new motion-picture industry augmenting the print-media sensationalism. The press and federal officials, particularly U.S. Attorney Edwin Sims in Chicago, claimed that a vast \u201cwhite slave trust\u201d stalked the country, when in fact, as David Langum noted in his book Crossing over the Line, there was little coerced prostitution at all.\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor, James R. Mann, claimed that the white-slave traffic, \u201cwhile not so extensive, is much more horrible than any black-slave traffic ever was.\u201d Widespread revulsion toward gambling had silenced constitutional scruples a decade earlier; now the universal abhorrence of prostitution had a similar impact. New York congressman William Sulzer added, \u201cI have no sympathy with the quibbling in regard to the constitutionality of the provisions of this bill. In this frightful matter I shall not allow technicalities to cloud my sense of immediate duty. The courts must take the responsibility for its constitutionality.\u201d President Taft signed the act in June 1910.\n\nThe Mann Act punished \u201cany person who shall knowingly transport or cause to be transported, or aid or assist in obtaining transportation for . . . any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose.\u201d The phrase \u201cany other immoral purpose\u201d appeared to include more than large-scale commercialized or coercive prostitution. Almost immediately, the government applied it to consenting fornicators and adulterers, absent any coercion or commercial exchange. In the case of Hoke v. United States (1913), Justice McKenna admitted that \u201cour dual form of government has its perplexities\u201d but concluded that \u201csurely if the facility of interstate transportation can be taken away from the demoralization of lotteries, the debasement of obscene literature, the contagion of diseased cattle or persons, the impurity of food and drugs, the like facility can be taken away from the systematic enticement to and the enslavement in prostitution and debauchery of women, and, more insistently, of girls.\u201d In acting against these evils, Congress \u201cmay adopt not only means necessary but convenient.\u201d\n\nThe Hoke case involved, if not coercive \u201cwhite slavery,\u201d at least commercial prostitution. The Court subsequently sustained prosecutions of a noncommercial nature. Shortly after Woodrow Wilson took office, Drew Caminetti, the son of his immigration commissioner, was prosecuted for traveling across state lines and engaging in sexual relations with a woman not his wife. The relationship was completely voluntary and not commercial. The Justice Department could hardly discontinue the case, begun under the previous Republican administration, lest it give an impression of political favoritism. In a 5\u20133 decision, the Court upheld this application of the Mann Act. The majority declared that it must abide by the plain words of the act, that any \u201cimmoral purpose\u201d was enough.\n\nJustice McKenna for the dissenters claimed that the \u201cWhite Slave Traffic Act\u201d title and legislative history showed that Congress intended to reach only \u201ccommercialized vice, immoralities having a mercenary purpose . . . vice as a business.\u201d \u201cEverybody knows that there is a difference between the occasional immoralities of men and women and that systematized and mercenary immorality epitomized in the statute\u2019s graphic phrase, \u2018white slave traffic.\u2019\u201d Nevertheless, Mann congratulated Justice William R. Day for his proper interpretation of the act. And there was enough confusion or ambivalence in the public mind as to what really defined \u201cprostitution\u201d to sustain this reading of the act. There would be nearly 5,000 Mann Act convictions over the next decade, most of which were noncommercial.\n\nThe Mann Act showed how far the federal police power had been extended. The great Chief Justice John Marshall, in the 1824 case Gibbons v.

Almost immediately, the government applied it to consenting fornicators and adulterers, absent any coercion or commercial exchange. In the case of Hoke v. United States (1913), Justice McKenna admitted that \u201cour dual form of government has its perplexities\u201d but concluded that \u201csurely if the facility of interstate transportation can be taken away from the demoralization of lotteries, the debasement of obscene literature, the contagion of diseased cattle or persons, the impurity of food and drugs, the like facility can be taken away from the systematic enticement to and the enslavement in prostitution and debauchery of women, and, more insistently, of girls.\u201d In acting against these evils, Congress \u201cmay adopt not only means necessary but convenient.\u201d#ad#\n\nThe Hoke case involved, if not coercive \u201cwhite slavery,\u201d at least commercial prostitution. The Court subsequently sustained prosecutions of a noncommercial nature. Shortly after Woodrow Wilson took office, Drew Caminetti, the son of his immigration commissioner, was prosecuted for traveling across state lines and engaging in sexual relations with a woman not his wife. The relationship was completely voluntary and not commercial. The Justice Department could hardly discontinue the case, begun under the previous Republican administration, lest it give an impression of political favoritism. In a 5\u20133 decision, the Court upheld this application of the Mann Act. The majority declared that it must abide by the plain words of the act, that any \u201cimmoral purpose\u201d was enough.\n\nJustice McKenna for the dissenters claimed that the \u201cWhite Slave Traffic Act\u201d title and legislative history showed that Congress intended to reach only \u201ccommercialized vice, immoralities having a mercenary purpose\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0vice as a business.\u201d \u201cEverybody knows that there is a difference between the occasional immoralities of men and women and that systematized and mercenary immorality epitomized in the statute\u2019s graphic phrase, \u2018white slave traffic.\u2019\u201d Nevertheless, Mann congratulated Justice William R. Day for his proper interpretation of the act. And there was enough confusion or ambivalence in the public mind as to what really defined \u201cprostitution\u201d to sustain this reading of the act. There would be nearly 5,000 Mann Act convictions over the next decade, most of which were noncommercial.\n\nThe Mann Act showed how far the federal police power had been extended. The great Chief Justice John Marshall, in the 1824 case Gibbons v. Ogden, had defined commerce as \u201cintercourse.\u201d Now his successors held that intercourse was commerce.\n\n\u2014 Paul Moreno is the director of academic programs at Hillsdale College\u2019s Kirby Center for Constitutional Studies and Citizenship.
