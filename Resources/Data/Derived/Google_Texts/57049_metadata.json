Gen. Randy S. Taylor introduced his husband, Lucas.\n\n\u201cMy husband Lucas is sitting up front here,\u201d Gen. Taylor said of the man in the same row as Mr. Carter, Army Secretary John McHugh and other senior officials. He said Lucas has subjugated his own career to support the general\u2019s frequent moves over an 18-year relationship.\n\nPHOTOS: BOOM! U.S. military turns ISIS targets to rubble\n\n\u201cWe bet everything on my Army career,\u201d said Gen. Taylor, whose 27 years of service spanned an outright ban on gays, then \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d and finally, the ban\u2019s lifting in 2011.\n\nGen. Taylor was the master of ceremonies for the Pentagon\u2019s 4th Gay Pride celebration that showcases a month of gay-themed posters and history.\n\nA panel discussion featured a gay Marine officer, a gay Army sergeant who is a criminal investigator, a lesbian chaplain and a transgender woman, Amanda Simpson, who is executive director of the Army\u2019s Office of Energy Initiatives.\n\nPHOTOS: Top 10 U.S. fighter jets\n\nShe is the first openly transgender political appointee in any presidential administration. She was chosen for the civilian post, she said, because she was \u201cthe best person to do the job.\u201d\n\nAll four introduced their wives, husbands, and, in one case, a fianc\u00e9 before a filled auditorium.\n\nMr. Carter spoke of his commitment to equal rights, but gave no hint of whether the administration will drop the ban on transgenders and transexuals wearing the uniform.\n\n\u201cWe need to be a meritocracy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to close ourselves off to any body \u2026. We must start from a position of inclusivity.\u201d\n\nTrained as an infantryman, Gen. Taylor is a communications and information specialist who deployed to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is now assigned to the Army office of chief of information.\n\nThe Pride event kicked off with the National Anthem, sung by the Rock Creek Singers, who are with the Gay Men\u2019s Chorus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A married Army general on Tuesday introduced his same-sex spouse at a Pentagon event that featured lots of top brass, including Defense Secretary Ashton Carter as the keynote speaker.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A married Army general on Tuesday introduced his same-sex spouse at a Pentagon event that featured lots of top brass, including Defense Secretary Ashton Carter as the keynote speaker.", "title": "Army Gen.
