The number of people over 65 will grow by 40 percent by 2025, said Kirch.\n\nAnother cause of increased demand will be Obamacare extending health insurance to the uninsured, creating a greater demand for medical services. The study accounted for all states expanding Medicaid, even though not all have done so.\n\nKirch pushed for Congress to increase contributions to medical graduate programs. Right now Congress funds about $3 billion a year to cover some tuition costs for up to 29,000 physicians a year. The program kicks in about $40,000 of the $152,000 per year medical student cost, the association said. The association wants Congress to fund an additional 3,000 physicians a year, which would cost another $1 billion annually.\n\nBecause training a new doctor takes between five and ten years, Congress needs to act now, he said.\n\nHowever, the additional physicians won't totally make up the shortfall. Kirch said new payment and healthcare delivery models are also needed to fill the gap but declined to elaborate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There won't be enough doctors to meet the booming demand for healthcare services over the next decade due primarily to the graying U.S. population, a new study claims.\nThe Association of American Medical Colleges detailed the shortage in a report released today that found the U.S. would face a shortage between 46,000 and 90,000 by 2025.
