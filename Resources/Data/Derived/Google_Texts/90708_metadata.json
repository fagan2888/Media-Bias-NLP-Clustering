What we need are the best books and, essays, as well as the best film depictions and art-works, that bring the actually quite passionate man to life. Here I\u2019ll offer a beginning draft for that list, and let FT readers fill it out as they see fit in the comments.\n\n1.) Chapter 2 of Gordon Wood, Revolutionary Characters: What Made the Founders Different\n\nSo you don\u2019t have time for one of those big bios of Washington? This book of biographical sketches might fit the bill. Wood makes the eighteenth-century ideal of the enlightenment gentleman key to understanding Washington, which works pretty well. It explains how he deliberately put on a character for the sake of serving his country, and took great pains to live up to it. This does a lot, I think, to explain the way can he seem too artificially proper to us today. The rest of the book is also great, with deft sketches of Franklin, Jefferson, Hamilton, and Burr. Wood is in certain aspects less successful with Madison and Adams, but the whole thing\u2019s a treat. An excellent audio version exists.\n\n2.) David Morse\u2019s portrayal of George Washington in the John Adams mini-series.\n\nMorse is able to convey a sense of the man\u2019s intensity and ambition constantly kept restrained by a cultivated sense of propriety, concern for others, and humility. A sense of his magnetism is kept. There are so many things to praise about this series in general, but its casting, which also resulted in an unforgettable portrayal Jefferson, was perhaps its greatest triumph.\n\n3.) The relevant chapter of David Bobb\u2019s Humility: An Unlikely Biography of America\u2019s Greatest Virtue\n\nI haven\u2019t read it yet, but simply based on Dr. Bobb\u2019s talk about it, which it was my pleasure to hear yesterday at Christopher Newport University, I know it\u2019s not to be missed.\n\n4.) James Thomas Flexner, Washington: The Indispensable Man\n\nFlexner\u2019s single-volume biography, condensed from his four-volume biography. It reads well, and feels quite comprehensive. The main argument is right there in the title.\n\n5.) Richard Brookhiser, Founding Father: Rediscovering George Washington\n\nAnother one I haven\u2019t read yet, but based on the excellence demonstrated by his short-form biographies of Hamilton and Madison, both of which I enjoyed quite a bit, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a must. Probably could say the same about Ron Chernow\u2019s more-standard long bio, but again, the thing about Brookhiser is that he draws you into to key aspects of a man\u2019s life, and you never get that 700-pages to go moment of discouragement.\n\n6.) If you\u2019re interested in the debate over Washington\u2019s belief in God, i.e., about whether he was a) a deist or just b) a particularly reticent Episcopalian, I\u2019d refer you to two books. The Political Philosophy of George Washington by Jeffry Morrison, which contains a section that makes an educated guess in favor of the first proposition, and Washington\u2019s God by Jana and Michael Novak, which is an entire book arguing for the second. I think the evidence sides more with Morrison, but he makes it clear that it was impossible that Washington\u2019s deism was of the stereotyped \u201cclock-maker\u201d kind: rather, and a bit like Alexis de Tocqueville, Washington believed in a God that was very much active in the world, and he may have believed in an afterlife, but he seems not have believed in the divinity of Christ. No-one can know another\u2019s heart, but Morrison has convinced me that the evidence leads to favoring that hypothesis.\n\nI\u2019ll leave it there for now\u0097Thomas Kidd supplied a a much more expert list over at Patheos last year, and again, I\u2019m counting on FT readers to provide their own recommendations, especially of the article-length or chapter-length variety.\n\nAnyhow, a happy George Washington\u2019s birthday to one and all!", "article_metadata": {"description": "A blog devoted to sharing initial thoughts on topics, and daily ramblings, First Thoughts speaks to the latest topics in religion and today\u2019s society.", "og": {"site_name": "First Things", "description": "It\u2019s George Washington\u2019s birthday, and the problem a lot of us have is that he comes . . . .", "title": "What Should We Read about George Washington? | Carl Scott", "url": "http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2014/02/what-should-we-read-about-george-washington", "image": "https://dae6ca3yfi9zj.cloudfront.net/img/feature-default.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@firstthingsmag", "image": "https://dae6ca3yfi9zj.cloudfront.net/img/feature-default.png", "description": "It\u2019s George Washington\u2019s birthday, and the problem a lot of us have is that he comes . . . .", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "What Should We Read about George Washington? | Carl Scott"}, "robots": "follow", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"admins": 1504860014}, "msvalidate.01": "649D2BEB6B8F0C1832C0762CD37C2FAE", "thumbnail": "https://dae6ca3yfi9zj.cloudfront.net/img/favicon-196.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd89d3\"", "article_summary": "David Morse\u2019s portrayal of George Washington in the John Adams mini-series.\nIt\u2019s George Washington\u2019s birthday, and the problem a lot of us have is that he comes across too stiffly for us to really appreciate.\nAnyhow, a happy George Washington\u2019s birthday to one and all!\nWood makes the eighteenth-century ideal of the enlightenment gentleman key to understanding Washington, which works pretty well.\nChapter 2 of Gordon Wood, Revolutionary Characters: What Made the Founders DifferentSo you don\u2019t have time for one of those big bios of Washington?"}
