In that sense, I don\u2019t think he is an ideologue.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama, who normalized relations with Cuba this year after more than a half-century of Cold War isolation, said he would make a decision on whether to travel there in the next few months.\n\nMr. Obama also acknowledged that the accelerating resumption of trade ties with Havana after a 50-year embargo will at least in part help to prop up the Castro regime.\n\nSEE ALSO: Feds now requiring tax, registration for private drones\n\n\u201cThere are going to be certain sectors of the economy where we think, if there\u2019s some modification of the application of the embargo, the Cuban people will benefit directly,\u201d he said, but \u201cthere are going to be some areas where it could prop up, you know, certain cronies of the regime, but not necessarily have widespread impact.\u201d\n\nSeparately, Cuba on Monday reached a breakthrough agreement with a group of foreign creditors over billions of dollars in unpaid debt dating back 25 years, The Associated Press reported.\n\nThe Paris Club of creditor nations announced a deal Monday under which creditors will cancel $8.5 billion in overdue interest payments, in exchange for a promise by Cuba to pay off $2.6 billion of the original debt over the next 18 years. The agreement is seen as critical to Havana\u2019s attempts to repair its finances and attract major new foreign investment capital.\n\nMr. Castro has been working to improve relations with creditors as he tries to modernize and open up the communist island\u2019s economy, which defaulted on its debts in 1986 and was devastated by the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, the AP reported. The U.S. maintains an economic embargo against Cuba, and is not among the creditor nations.\n\nThe group of Cuban creditors includes: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Britain.\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan group of elected officials from Kansas wrote to Mr. Obama Monday to urge him to \u201cbear in mind the concerns and thoughts of the citizens of Kansas\u201d before he considers transferring terrorism detainees from the Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba to Fort Leavenworth.\n\n\u201cThe people of Leavenworth, Kansas \u2014 regardless of political parties \u2014 are strongly against the plan to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center and transfer detainees to American soil,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe urge you to consider their thoughts and concerns before taking any executive actions to follow through on your plans.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama has been unable to carry out a campaign pledge from his first election in 2008 to close the detainee facility, in the face of bipartisan resistance in Congress to transferring some of the most notorious terrorists imprisoned there to the U.S. mainland.\n\n\u2981 This article was based in part on wire service reports.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama said he hopes to visit Cuba next year to meet with pro-Democracy dissidents, and he doesn't view communist Cuban President Raul Castro as an \"ideologue.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama said he hopes to visit Cuba next year to meet with pro-Democracy dissidents, and he doesn\u2019t view communist Cuban President Raul Castro as an \u201cideologue.\u201d", "title": "Obama says Raul Castro is not an \u2018ideologue,\u2019 hopes to visit Cuba next year", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/14/obama-says-raul-castro-not-ideologue-hopes-visit-c/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/29/AP_349524144544.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/29/AP_349524144544.jpg", "description": "President Obama said he hopes to visit Cuba next year to meet with pro-Democracy dissidents, and he doesn't view communist Cuban President Raul Castro as an \"ideologue.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama says Raul Castro is not an \u2018ideologue,\u2019 hopes to vis"}, "Author": "Dave Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Ra\u00fal Castro, Cuba"}, "article_summary": "Mr. Obama also acknowledged that the accelerating resumption of trade ties with Havana after a 50-year embargo will at least in part help to prop up the Castro regime.\nThe group of Cuban creditors includes: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Britain.\nPresident Obama said he hopes to make a landmark visit to Cuba before he leaves office if he can visit with pro-democracy dissidents as part of the trip, adding he doesn\u2019t view communist Cuban President Raul Castro as an \u201cideologue.\u201d\u201cIf I go on a visit, then part of the deal is that I get to talk to everybody,\u201d Mr. Obama told Yahoo News in an interview published Monday.\nThe U.S. maintains an economic embargo against Cuba, and is not among the creditor nations.\nThe agreement is seen as critical to Havana\u2019s attempts to repair its finances and attract major new foreign investment capital."}
