The state legislature last year voted to expand Medicaid\u2019s dental benefits to adults \u2013 before it only covered children for most kinds of care.\n\nThe change will go into effect around the same time as Colorado expands Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act to those who make slightly more than the federal poverty level.\n\nThe pair of changes is expected to grow the ranks of Medicaid enrollees with dental benefits to 844,491 in 2016, from 348,142 in 2012, according to a study released last month by the Colorado Health Institute.\n\nBut 17 counties in Colorado don\u2019t have a dentist who accepts Medicaid, the study reported, and there will be \"dental deserts\" where no care is available even with increased benefits.\n\nSome rural areas simply don\u2019t have dentists at all \u2013 you won\u2019t find one in sparsely populated Kiowa County in the eastern plains, or in southern Colorado\u2019s Mineral County, the institute found. In more populous Delta and Elbert counties, there are dentists \u2013 but none that take Medicaid.\n\n\u201cWe are on the verge of much better care for our underserved population,\u201d said Cara Russell, who heads Chaffee County\u2019s program to improve oral health, which works to educate people on the importance of good oral hygiene. \u201cBut we\u2019re not there yet, and the transition is going to be painful.\u201d\n\nChaffee is a county where few dentists accept Medicaid, and residents there can often drive 65 to 110 miles to find a dentist who does, Russell said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Health, Public Service Journalism", "original-source": "http://inewsnetwork.org/2014/01/06/study-dental-deserts-likely-as-more-coloradans-receive-benefits/", "og": {"site_name": "Rocky Mountain PBS News", "description": "A new report from the Colorado Health Institute says almost a half-million additional Coloradans will have Medicaid dental benefits by 2016.
