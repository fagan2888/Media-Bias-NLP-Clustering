KANSAS CITY, Mo., Aug. 23 (UPI) -- Dave Grohl and his fellow Foo Fighters bandmates used music to fight back against the Westboro Baptist Church's weekend protest against homosexuality.

Picketers gathered Friday night outside the rock group's concert in Kansas City, Mo. Members of the organization typically choose high-profile events to attract media attention so they can promote their anti-gay agenda.

Foo Fighters responded to the demonstration by piling into the back of a pickup truck, driving right up to the protesters and blasting the Rick Astley tune "Never Going to Give You Up."

The stunt is a live version of the "rickrolling" Internet meme by which someone clicks on an online hyperlink that appears to be of interest to them -- only to find it leads to Astley's music video.
