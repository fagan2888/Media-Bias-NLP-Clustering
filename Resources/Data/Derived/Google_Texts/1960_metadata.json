Steve Smith, R-Maricopa, said the $1-a-month premium is an accounting \u201cgimmick\u201d that hides what he claimed is really a subsidy of taxpayer dollars. But Sen. Olivia Cajero Bedford, D-Tucson, said federal law already prohibits public funds for elective abortions, arguing there is no evidence that public dollars are being used for the procedure.\n\nThe legislation has exceptions for coverage designed to save a woman\u2019s life or in cases of rape and incest.\n\nSB1318 also includes a provision which requires doctors to tell women that a medication abortion started with administration of RU-486 can be reversed with high doses of the hormone progesterone.\n\n\u201cThis is junk science, this is quack medicine,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Katie Hobbs, D-Phoenix. And she said even if the abortion can be halted, the hormone can lead to birth defects.\n\n\u201cI think a cleft palate is preferable to killing a little baby,\u201d responded Sen. Kelly Ward, R-Lake Havasu City.\n\nThe measure now goes to Gov. Doug Ducey. During the campaign, Ducey said he is opposed to abortion but has said nothing about this particular legislation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On an 18-11 margin the Senate on Wednesday gave final approval to legislation barring Arizonans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act from getting coverage for elective abortions, even if they pay a separate premium out of their own pocket.", "generator": "WordPress", "author": "Howard Fischer, Capitol Media Services", "og": {"site_name": "Arizona Capitol Times", "description": "On an 18-11 margin the Senate on Wednesday gave final approval to legislation barring Arizonans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act from getting coverage for elective abor...", "title": "Affordable Care Act abortion bill goes to the governor", "url": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2015/03/25/affordable-care-act-abortion-bill-goes-to-the-governor/", "image": "http://azcapitoltimes.com/files/2015/03/abortion-hands-baby620.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Affordable Care Act abortion bill goes to the governorArizona Capitol Times", "keywords": "arizona, affordable care act, abortions, prohibition, doug ducey, elective abortions, steve smith, sb1318,abortions,affordable care act,doug ducey,elective abortions,prohibition,sb1318,steve smith", "msvalidate.01": "118D5E2D5722A6F1A827250C4D8CEC95", "google-site-verification": "yBUjZkZhQp3gSLHDjf3ORiAV2B17Yp4XZVxbpx8h4_M", "y_key": "7be161f96cdbc5bc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "During the campaign, Ducey said he is opposed to abortion but has said nothing about this particular legislation.\nAnd she said even if the abortion can be halted, the hormone can lead to birth defects.\nBut Sen.
