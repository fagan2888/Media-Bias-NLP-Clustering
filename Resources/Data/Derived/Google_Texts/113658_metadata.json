Calamari, director of the SEC\u2019s New York Regional Office, in a press release. \u201cHe said all the right things to make investors believe he was making the right investments and taking the right precautions with their money, but he was merely telling blatant false tales about the safety and success of the investments.\u201d\n\nRelated: The 5 Worst Money Mistakes of Millionaires\n\nValente and his firm the ELIV Group would hold informational seminars to lure potential investors by telling them that the principal amount of their investments was fully backed by a large money market fund, while in fact there was no such fund and the majority of ELIV Group\u2019s funds were in illiquid investments in privately-held companies. Additionally, Valente had already filed twice for bankruptcy and was expelled from the broker-dealer industry in 2009 for engaging in serial misconduct.\n\nInvestment frauds are a common occurrence in America, but you don\u2019t have to be the next victim. Here are five red flags that can help you spot a fraudulent investment adviser:\n\nThe investment adviser isn\u2019t registered with the SEC or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. You can check advisers\u2019 registration information for free on FINRA\u2019s website, which also lists a history of complaints. A quick search for Valente showed he hasn\u2019t been registered since 2009. The adviser guarantees consistent high returns. Valente notes on his website that the ELIV Group Investment Fund has returned a five-year average annual return of 34.5 percent. This is more than twice the five-year average annual return of Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway. If it\u2019s too good to be true, it\u2019s probably a scam. Investment strategies are overly complex. You should always be able to easily understand what the adviser plans to do with your money, including the risk involved. The sales pitch is a bit too pushy and leads you to believe that you have to hurry to take advantage of a certain investment opportunity. You should never feel pressured to make a quick decision when your money is at stake. Take your time and talk about the opportunity with a reliable third party. All your friends have already hired this adviser. Working their way through an organization or a group of friends is a common tactic of fraudsters who rely on our fear of failure to keep up financially with our peers.
