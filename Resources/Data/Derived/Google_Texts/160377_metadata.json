Rahm\u2019s troubles in the Windy City have been growing by the day, with the Black Lives Matter crew calling for his scalp\u2026 figuratively for now. His firing of Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy in the wake of revelations about former officer Jason Van Dyke\u2019s shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times hasn\u2019t sated the crowd\u2019s appetite for scalps at all. The evidence is mounting and it\u2019s looking harder and harder to draw any conclusion other than the theory that Emanuel squashed the release of the now infamous, damning video tape until he had gotten through his reelection bid and subsequent run-off race.\n\nBut as of last Wednesday, Hillary Clinton was still standing by her man. (New York Daily News)\n\n\u2018Hillary Clinton is deeply troubled by the shooting of Laquan McDonald and the outstanding questions related to both the shooting and the video,\u2019 said Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon. He said that while Emanuel\u2019s call for a review of the city\u2019s police department is an \u2018important step,\u2019 Clinton supports a full review by the Justice Department. Clinton\u2019s decision, first reported by the Chicago Tribune, puts her at odds with the mayor, a former chief of staff to President Barack Obama and a longtime Clinton ally who said earlier Wednesday that such a review would be \u2018misguided.\u2019 But demonstrators have set their sights on Rahm Emanuel and Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Anita Alvarez as film director Spike Lee warned \u2018some more heads are gonna roll\u2019.\n\nAs of yesterday, reporters were pressing Clinton on the issue and she was still stating that she stood by Emanuel and is \u201cconfident that he\u2019s going to do everything he can to get to the bottom\u201d of this. That had to be an uncomfortable moment because on the same day, Bernie Sanders stated that any elected official \u201cwith knowledge that the tape was being suppressed or improperly withheld should resign.\u201d\n\nSo Hillary is still on Team Rahm, but a chorus of voices seem to disagree with her. This is particularly true of those who are invested in the Black Lives Matter movement. Rahm is quickly turning into one of those you\u2019re either with us or against us topics. (Daily Mail)\n\nBut so far Clinton, who vowed to \u201creplenish our depleted reservoirs of trust\u201d between law enforcement and communities of color, has only said, via a spokesman, that she is \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the shooting and \u201cthe outstanding questions related to both the shooting and the video.\u201d As to Emanuel? \u201cShe knows Mayor Emanuel loves Chicago, and is sure he wants to do all he can to restore trust in the Chicago Police Department.\u201d Asking the mayor who spent 400 days eroding that trust to help restore it now that he\u2019s been caught is stationing the fox outside the hen house. If Clinton is serious about black lives \u2014 and not just black votes \u2014 this is a moment of truth.\n\nHillary may not need to worry about Bernie Sanders overtaking her, but there are longer term issues for her to wrestle with here. It\u2019s not enough for her to win a significant majority of the black vote in the general election. (Anyone with a D after their name can do that.) She needs to win it significantly the same way Barack Obama did while simultaneously getting black voters to turn out in near record numbers. If that element of her base views her as \u201cjust another phony white politician\u201d and stays home on election day, any Republican candidate will have a big leg up.\n\nBut Hillary can\u2019t just mouth the right lines for those supporters as she does on so many other issues. The ties between Rahm Emanuel and the Clintons go back far too deeply and, as it\u2019s often described in politics, he knows where all the bodies are buried. (Some only half jokingly suggest that might be literally true.) If Rahm remains on the hot seat or, worse, faces a recall, everyone will want to know if he has the Democrat front-runner\u2019s support. If she throws him under the bus he could be a very unpleasant enemy to have, assuming he feels like becoming petulant about it. But if she lends him her support, the base may become more than restless as the BLM chants grow outside her window.\n\nWhat\u2019s a former First Lady to do? This is the Chicago Way, and there are rules to be followed.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Besties", "title": "How big is Hillary\u2019s \u201cRahm problem\u201d now?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/12/06/how-big-is-hillarys-rahm-problem-now/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-06T14:31:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-05T23:50:21+00:00"}, "keywords": "black lives matter, Chicago, cover up, crime, Hillary Clinton, Illinois, police shooting, Rahm Emanuel,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "But as of last Wednesday, Hillary Clinton was still standing by her man.\nThe ties between Rahm Emanuel and the Clintons go back far too deeply and, as it\u2019s often described in politics, he knows where all the bodies are buried.\nHow big is Hillary\u2019s \u201cRahm problem\u201d now?\nIf Rahm remains on the hot seat or, worse, faces a recall, everyone will want to know if he has the Democrat front-runner\u2019s support.\nIf Clinton is serious about black lives \u2014 and not just black votes \u2014 this is a moment of truth."}
