In fact in my opinion it was never right to say the thing I definitely don\u2019t want to but probably will have said. To those I (will have) offended please understand how truly sorry I already am. I am fully aware that the subject matter of my imminent forthcoming mistake, a blunder (possibly to be) dubbed \u201cJurassicGate\u201d is (most likely) in no way a laughing matter.\n\nWe applaud you, Chris Pratt.\n\nRead the whole status below:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "These days, you can barely step out the door without accidentally offending/microaggressing someone.", "title": "Chris Pratt hilariously mocks PC culture, preemptively...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2015/05/ChrisPrattAP-600x337.jpg", "height": 337}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2015/05/24/chris-pratt-hilariously-mocks-pc-culture-preemptively-apologizes-inevitable-jurassicgate/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "pc", "published_time": "2015-05-24T11:56:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-24T11:56:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd600c\"", "article_summary": "We applaud you, Chris Pratt.\nThese days, you can barely step out the door without accidentally offending/microaggressing someone.\nIn fact in my opinion it was never right to say the thing I definitely don\u2019t want to but probably will have said.\nI am fully aware that the subject matter of my imminent forthcoming mistake, a blunder (possibly to be) dubbed \u201cJurassicGate\u201d is (most likely) in no way a laughing matter.\nTo those I (will have) offended please understand how truly sorry I already am."}
