Nicki Minaj

Nicki Minaj released her new video for “Anaconda” overnight and, par for the course, the song is an unabashed ode to sex and the female backside. The title is a reference to a line in Sir Mix-A- Lot’s classic hip-hop track “Baby Got Back” (she samples it throughout).

Like the tune itself, the “Anaconda” plot isn’t that deep. Minaj and her back-up dancers shake themselves through a jungle, a kitchen, and a stark white room, with whipped cream and bananas popping up as not-so-subtle props. Rapper Drake makes a guest appearance towards the end, where Minaj does a strip-tease like dance in front of him. Naturally, he seems impressed.

Is the whole thing impressive though? With everything Minaj seems to touch these days, it’s likely the “Anaconda” video will be another lightning rod for whether or not Minaj herself is a leader of female empowerment via twerking or just another sexually exploitive visual that degrades women. The comment section already has thousands of Nicki haters and defenders bickering back and forth. One thing’s for certain: the song itself is a censor’s dream come true.

Still, the video has over two million views in less than 12 hours. Sir Mix-A-Lot would be proud.
