He did not mention specific municipalities from any of the states.\n\nRosenberg noted in the suit that Redflex \u201cbestowed gifts and bribes on ... officials in dozens of municipalities within, but not limited to the following states: California, Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Colorado, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Florida, New Jersey, Tennessee, Virginia, and Georgia.\u201d\n\nHe said Redflex bribed local officials with meals, golf outings and tickets to professional football and baseball games. The expenses were listed as categories such as \u201centertainment\u201d and \u201ccelebratory tokens,\u201d according to the suit.\n\nRedflex lost its $100 million red-light camera contract with the city of Chicago amid allegations of bribery, following reporting by the Chicago Tribune.\n\n\u201cRedflex was fired in Chicago for corruption. Nobody gets fired for corruption in Chicago,\u201d said Assemblyman Declan O\u2019Scanlon (R-Monmouth), an outspoken critic of the cameras in New Jersey, who called for an investigation.\n\nRedflex has red-light cameras in Newark, Edison, New Brunswick, Cherry Hill, Englewood Cliffs, Springfield and Stratford.\n\nNewark has 19 intersections with red-light cameras \u2014 one-quarter of the 76 intersections with red-light cameras in New Jersey. The busiest red-light camera in the state for violations is in Cherry Hill.\n\n\u201cRedflex Traffic Systems denies the allegations in the counterclaim which are from Aaron Rosenberg, a former executive vice president, terminated for violating company policies and procedures,\u201d Redflex said in a statement. \u201cRedflex will aggressively defend itself against the allegations as well as prosecute its claims against the former executive. We are committed to transparency and honesty in our business practices. Our focus continues to be on providing best in class customer service and technology to our clients to make their communities safer.\u201d\n\nEsmeralda Diaz Cameron, director of communications for the mayor's office in Newark, said Friday night that the city accepted no gifts from Redflex.\n\n\u201cThe City of Newark\u2019s red-light camera program (has) been run ethically and we continue to focus on the public safety aspects of the program,\" she said. \"We are confident that Redflex has made the necessary changes to ensure that this type of activity never happens again. The City of Newark is proud of the safety benefits that we have seen here in our city, which to date has seen a 51 percent decrease in total accidents at some of the city\u2019s most dangerous intersections.\u201d\n\nRosenberg was fired by Redflex a year ago after the Chicago controversy became public, and the company sued him in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona for misappropriation of company funds. In his answer/counterclaim, Rosenberg said he was simply \"carrying out orders\" from Redflex.\n\n\n\nO\u2019Scanlon said the lawsuit and the firing of Redflex in Chicago raise huge red flags.\n\n\u201cWe have an executive of one of the (red-light camera) companies admitting that it was a standard business practice to bribe local officials,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s huge. It\u2019s outrageous.\u201d\n\nOwners of vehicles caught on camera going through a red light, or failing to come to a complete stop on a right turn on red, receive tickets of $85 or $140. Proponents say they increase safety while raising revenue for cash-strapped towns. Opponents call them a money grab and say they increase rear-end accidents.\n\nOn Thursday, O\u2019Scanlon stood with the mayor of Brick Township at a news conference in which that Ocean County community became the first New Jersey municipality to pull the plug on its red-light cameras.\n\nBrick has a different vendor, American Traffic Solutions, also of Arizona.\n\nThe cameras at three intersections in the Shore town will go dark on Feb. 18, after new Mayor John Ducey said he was not convinced the automated traffic cops were making the roads safer.\n\nOne of the intersections, Brick Boulevard and Chambers Bridge Road, had 13 accidents and 5 right-angle accidents before the cameras went in and 28 accidents and 8 right-angle crashes in the last full year, Ducey said.\n\n\u201cI will not continue the practices of the past and try to balance our budget through punitive measures,\u201d he said.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 Meanest red-light cameras in N.J. pumped out thousands of citations in 2013\n\n\n\n\u2022 Settlement reached in red-light camera class action suit\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@bergen-county','@mobile','@river','camden-county','essex-county','middlesex-county','monmouth-county','nj-traffic','nj-transportation','ocean-county','technology','union-county'", "title": "Fired red-light camera executive: Company bribed officials in 13 states, including NJ", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Fired red-light camera executive: Company bribed officials in 13 states, including NJ\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/02/fired_red-light_camera_executive_company_bribed_officials_in_13_states_including_nj.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/02/red-light-camerasjpg-fc1917b32bb708e2.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12155851\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-08T13:04:03Z\", \"author\": \"Mike Frassinelli/The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@bergen-county\",\"@mobile\",\"@river\",\"camden-county\",\"essex-county\",\"middlesex-county\",\"monmouth-county\",\"nj-traffic\",\"nj-transportation\",\"ocean-county\",\"technology\",\"union-county\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/02/14236961-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@MikeFrassinelli", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Redflex Traffic Systems has red-light cameras in 8 New Jersey towns"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, February 08, 2014,  8:57 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/02/red-light-camerasjpg-fc1917b32bb708e2.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"mfrassin\", \"author_nickname\": \"Mike Frassinelli/The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"5099\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Redflex Traffic Systems has red-light cameras in 8 New Jersey towns", "title": "Fired red-light camera executive: Company bribed officials in 13 states, including NJ", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/02/fired_red-light_camera_executive_company_bribed_officials_in_13_states_including_nj.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, February 08, 2014,  8:00 AM", "article_author": "Mike Frassinelli/The Star-Ledger", "Description": "Redflex Traffic Systems has red-light cameras in 8 New Jersey towns"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfdf9\"", "article_summary": "RELATED COVERAGE\u2022 Meanest red-light cameras in N.J. pumped out thousands of citations in 2013\u2022 Settlement reached in red-light camera class action suit\nNewark has 19 intersections with red-light cameras \u2014 one-quarter of the 76 intersections with red-light cameras in New Jersey.\nThe busiest red-light camera in the state for violations is in Cherry Hill.\n\u201cWe have an executive of one of the (red-light camera) companies admitting that it was a standard business practice to bribe local officials,\u201d he said.\nRedflex lost its $100 million red-light camera contract with the city of Chicago amid allegations of bribery, following reporting by the Chicago Tribune."}
