Last Friday, when the Supreme Court ruled same-sex marriage legal nationwide, reaction was swift and for the most part overwhelmingly positive throughout not just the United States, but worldwide.

Like everyone else, musicians had an instant response to the decision, taking to social media in droves to express their thoughts.

“Same sex marriage is now legally a right in the United States of America,” tweeted Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello. “A great day for human rights & human love.”

“#LoveisLove,” Kiss co-founder Paul Stanley put out in a hashtag. “FINALLY. Marriage equality for all. Congratulations to ALL!”

“Finally And at Last!” tweeted an obviously excited Madonna, who has long been a supporter of gay rights. “The Revolution Of Love has Begun!”

“This is one of three scores: Confederate flags came down today, Obamacare was decidedly upheld by Supreme Court,” tweeted Ann Wilson from Heart. “A VERY good day. #LoveWins”

“Congrats to all our gay and lesbian fans on today’s Supreme Court ruling,” tweeted Smashing Pumpkins main man Billy Corgan. I’ve always believed in my heart that this was a just right 4 all.”

“Super awesome win for equality!” tweeted Mark Hoppus of Blink-182.

“Times are changing,” tweeted openly gay British newcomer and multiple Grammy Award winner Sam Smith. “I couldn’t be prouder to be gay.”

But not everyone was as positive about the ruling.

“It’s a sad day for those that care about spirituality and principles based on the Bible! Move on and join the 21st Century?” wrote Joe Bonsall of the Oak Ridge Boys. “I choose Jesus!”

Not surprisingly, Bonsall was skewered for his negativity by many fellow musicians, but he stood his ground.
