Ralph Miliband was born in Belgium in 1924, to Polish Jews. In 1940, when he was sixteen years old, he fled to Britain to escape the Nazis. He and his father walked a hundred kilometres from Brussels to the coast of West Flanders, where they caught one of the final boats to embark before the Germans arrived. He changed his birth name\u2014Adolphe\u2014because of its new connotation, learned English, and helped his father make a living by removing furniture from houses bombed in the Blitz. He began his schooling at Acton Technical College, and was later accepted by the London School of Economics. His studies there were interrupted by three years spent in the British Navy. After his service, he returned to L.S.E., and went on to teach there and at other universities in Britain, Canada, and the United States, and to be a prominent Marxist sociologist. When he died, in 1994, his obituary in the Telegraph noted that \u201cThough committed to socialism, he never hesitated to criticise its distortion by Stalin and other dictators.\u201d\n\nMiliband and his wife, Marion Kozak, a Polish Holocaust survivor, had two children. David, born in 1965, joined Tony Blair\u2019s government when he was twenty-nine, and served as foreign secretary under Gordon Brown. In 2010, the year Brown left office, Ed, who is four years David\u2019s junior, narrowly beat his older brother out in a vote to head the party. Today, Ed Miliband is the \u201cLeader of Her Majesty\u2019s Most Loyal Opposition,\u201d the Labour alternative to Prime Minister David Cameron, who leads the Conservative Party.\n\nRalph Miliband died almost twenty years ago. But now he is suddenly a major news story in England. Last weekend, the Daily Mail published an editorial by Geoffrey Levy about Ralph Miliband. The title: \u201cThe Man Who Hated Britain.\u201d The occasion was a new memoir by Damian McBride, Gordon Brown\u2019s press chief, that suggested Ed Miliband was attempting to \u201cachieve his father\u2019s vision\u201d by gaining leadership. Levy\u2019s concern, as summarized in a secondary headline: \u201c RED ED\u2019S PLEDGE TO BRING BACK SOCIALISM IS A HOMAGE TO HIS MARXIST FATHER .\u201d\n\nIn the piece, Levy cited a diary entry that Ralph Miliband wrote when he was seventeen years old, having just fled the Nazis, in which he ruminated on the fierce nationalism, even jingoism, of the Brits: \u201cThey have the greatest contempt for the Continent. \u2026 To lose their empire would be the worst possible humiliation.\u201d Levy wrote, \u201cThis adolescent distaste for the British character certainly didn\u2019t stop him availing himself of the fine education that was on offer in this country, or spending the rest of his life here.\u201d\n\nIn considering Miliband\u2019s intellectual work, Levy continued, \u201cone is entitled to wonder whether Ralph Miliband\u2019s Marxism was actually fuelled by a giant-sized social chip on his shoulder as he lived in his adoptive country. \u2026 Like all Left-wing thinkers, Ralph Miliband knew how to explain away awkward events.\u201d\n\nEd Miliband immediately objected to this \u201cappalling\u201d characterization of his father, and on Tuesday, the paper published his response, \u201cWhy My Father Loved Britain.\u201d It began, \u201cIt was June 1944 and the Allies were landing in Normandy. A 20-year-old man, who had arrived in Britain as a refugee just four years earlier, was part of that fight. He was my father.\u201d\n\nMiliband fils went on to explain that Britain saved his father; many members of the Miliband family were killed by the Nazis. \u201cLike most refugees,\u201d Ed Miliband wrote, \u201cthe security of our country was really important to him. And like some refugees, he owed his life to it. So my Dad loved Britain, he served Britain, and he taught both David and me to do the same.\u201d As for his father\u2019s influence:\n\nMy father\u2019s strongly Left-wing views are well known, as is the fact that I have pursued a different path and I have a different vision. \u2026 I want to make capitalism work for working people, not destroy it.\n\nThe Daily Mail published Milband\u2019s defense in a spread alongside an editorial called \u201cAn Evil Legacy and Why We Won\u2019t Apologise,\u201d and above a rehash of Levy\u2019s earlier piece: \u201cWe repeat: This man DID hate Britain.\u201d There was little space on the page, or in the reader\u2019s mind, for the son to define himself in opposition to the father.\n\nThis gambit\u2014the father as ideological cryptographic key\u2014will sound familiar to anyone who has watched the response, among a certain sector of the Republican Party, to Barack Obama. In September, 2010, Forbes magazine printed a substantial story by the conservative writer Dinesh D\u2019Souza, called \u201cHow Obama Thinks.\u201d It considered the President as a puzzle\u2014mystifying, anomalous, bizarre. D\u2019Souza wrote: \u201cA good way to discern what motivates Obama is to ask a simple question: What is his dream?\u201d He answered: \u201cIt is certainly not the American dream as conceived by the founders.\u201d Pointing a finger at the title of Obama\u2019s memoir, \u201cDreams from my Father\u201d\u2014\u201cObama isn\u2019t writing about his father\u2019s dreams; he is writing about the dreams he received from his father\u201d\u2014he proceeded:\n\nIncredibly, the U.S. is being ruled according to the dreams of a Luo tribesman of the 1950s. This philandering, inebriated African socialist, who raged against the world for denying him the realization of his anticolonial ambitions, is now setting the nation\u2019s agenda through the reincarnation of his dreams in his son.\n\nMany Republicans adopted D\u2019Souza\u2019s language and theories, in a rash of birtherism. Mike Huckabee insisted that Obama was raised in Kenya, that he \u201cprobably grew up hearing that the British were a bunch of imperialists who persecuted his grandfather.\u201d John Sununu, a former White House chief of staff and a close Romney surrogate, mimicked D\u2019Souza\u2019s rhetoric when he said, \u201cI wish this president would learn how to be an American.\u201d And Newt Gingrich gushed over D\u2019Souza\u2019s \u201cstunning,\u201d \u201cprofound insight\u201d into the President.\n\nWhat Gingrich expressed goes, in some way, to the heart of the opposition to Obama. To those like D\u2019Souza, Gingrich, Michele Bachmann, Obama is forever tainted by his father\u2019s heritage and decisions, and there is nothing he can do to lift their suspicions. His ancestors were not all American (whose were?), and it makes him un-American; similarly, Ralph Miliband\u2019s leftism is deemed more suspicious because it is tied to his foreignness.\n\nThe scare tactics used by those who oppose the President have been front and center this week in the government shutdown. During his pseudo-filibuster, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, said of those Republicans who would not stand with him in his campaign against Obamacare:\n\nLook, we saw in Britain, Neville Chamberlain, who told the British people, Accept the Nazis. Yes, they\u2019ll dominate the continent of Europe but that\u2019s not our problem. Let\u2019s appease them. Why? Because it can\u2019t be done. We can\u2019t possibly stand against them.\n\nIt seems, to some, a matter not of policy and congressional order, but of character and contempt.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Miliband family gathered in London at a private memorial service for Ed\u2019s uncle, Professor Harry Keen. Reporters snuck in and asked the mourners assembled about Ralph Miliband and whether he \u2018hated Britain.\u2019 Perhaps the American experience offers help in maintaining one\u2019s equanimity in the face of encounters like that. Barack Obama has not found a way to entirely shake the smears and fright\u2014over the fact of his birth to a particular man, associations that have been deemed alien, from what they want to see when they look at his face. But he has been elected President of the United States, twice. Does that count as partial liberation from the dreams\u2014the ones disturbing his enemies\u2019 sleep\u2014of his father?\n\nPhotograph by Peter Macdiarmid/Getty.", "article_metadata": {"cache-version": 20160524162657, "description": "Obama\u2019s ancestors were not all American (whose were?), and it makes him un-American; similarly, Ralph Milliband\u2019s leftism is deemed more suspicious \u2026", "account-url": "https://account.newyorker.com", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "og": {"site_name": "The New Yorker", "description": "Obama\u2019s ancestors were not all American (whose were?), and it makes him un-American; similarly, Ralph Milliband\u2019s leftism is deemed more suspicious \u2026", "title": "Dreams of Their Fathers: The Milibands and Obama - The New Yorker", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 290, "identifier": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/david-ed-miliband-290.jpg", "height": 329}, "updated_time": "2014-07-16T18:29:13-04:00", "url": "http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/dreams-of-their-fathers-the-milibands-and-obama", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama\u2019s ancestors were not all American (whose were?), and it makes him un-American; similarly, Ralph Milliband\u2019s leftism is deemed more suspicious \u2026", "creator": "@newyorker", "image": "http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/david-ed-miliband-290.jpg", "title": "Dreams of Their Fathers: The Milibands and Obama - The New Yorker", "site": "@newyorker", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The New Yorker", "robots": "noodp", "parsely-metadata": "{\"id\":\"1797191\",\"title_alt\":\"Dreams of Their Fathers: The Milibands and Obama\",\"featured_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.newyorker.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/10\\/david-ed-miliband-290.jpg\"}", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "environment": "prod", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1081530898", "fb": {"admins": 757909316}, "article": {"section": "News Desk", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2013-10-05T09:24:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-16T18:29:13-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "_jvLA9pRQom0-f6587wRKrNwfRtqyKzjfYWvwcZ5fxc", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "id": 1797191, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd39b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cLike most refugees,\u201d Ed Miliband wrote, \u201cthe security of our country was really important to him.\nToday, Ed Miliband is the \u201cLeader of Her Majesty\u2019s Most Loyal Opposition,\u201d the Labour alternative to Prime Minister David Cameron, who leads the Conservative Party.\nLast weekend, the Daily Mail published an editorial by Geoffrey Levy about Ralph Miliband.\nRalph Miliband was born in Belgium in 1924, to Polish Jews.\nRalph Miliband died almost twenty years ago."}
