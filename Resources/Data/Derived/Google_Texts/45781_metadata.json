It\u2019s like having open-heart surgery without anesthesia.\n\n\u201cIt falls into the \u2018most stressful\u2019 category,\u201d said Peter Brenton, of Medford, Mass., who, with his two older sisters, cleared out their childhood home this past year after their mother died. Having gone through this myself, I felt an instant rapport.\n\n\u201cOur parents weren\u2019t classic hoarders,\u201d said Brenton, who is 47 and among the most clear-headed people I have ever talked to. (I learned he worked as an administrator in the nuclear engineering department at MIT.) \u201cBut they hung onto a lot of things they saw no reason to throw away.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me about it!\u201d I said. I think of the dozens of gift bags Mom had stashed, and all the vases from every floral arrangement she\u2019d ever received.\n\n\u201cFinancial papers and receipts that went back 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cWedding gifts they received in 1955, which they didn\u2019t like and never opened. Guns and ammunition.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait. Guns and ammunition?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a gun license,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Massachusetts it\u2019s illegal for me to carry even a bullet. What was I supposed to do with this?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe memorabilia was the most excruciating,\u201d said his oldest sister, Anne Brenton Isenberg. \u201cWe opened box after box marked \u2018miscellaneous.\u2019 Every box was like a time capsule.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy parents had the exact same boxes!\u201d I said. \u201cYou open one and fall into the Black Hole of Calcutta.\u201d\n\nEvery family moves through the process differently, some better than others. These siblings began last spring, and dedicated most Sundays to the task.\n\n\u201cAs the executor, Peter felt the weight of the job,\u201d said Isenberg, who\u2019s 55. \u201cHe was the practical one and kept pushing. My sister and I would have let things sit for a year.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I had to be more firm than was polite,\u201d Brenton said.\n\nThe first two Sundays, they filled two Dumpsters. That was the easy part. \u201cHere\u2019s where it got sensitive,\u201d Brenton said. \u201cMost Sundays we worked six to seven hours, except when we got in a stupid fight.\u201d\n\nThe day they spent sticking their names on items they wanted \u201cended in a horrible argument,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of us was blameless.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love my siblings,\u201d Isenberg said, \u201cbut we had to pull away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe fought not over any (one) thing, but because of the emotional weight of sorting through it all,\u201d said Brenton. They made a rule: Nothing would leave the house without all three agreeing.\n\nThen he nailed the heart of the problem: \u201cWe knew we had to get rid of 95 percent of the stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of us has a huge house. We all have our own objects that have sentimental value.\u201d\n\nThey didn\u2019t need to explain it to me. I wanted to cling like a barnacle to every remnant of the lives that were slipping from me, but I also did not want to add to my load.\n\nFor those of you who still have this coming, here are some guiding lights that helped the Brentons get through it.\n\n1. Keep the end in mind. When the siblings\u2019 spirits lagged, Brenton brought up their goal: Empty the house \u2014 which was costing them $1,800 a month \u2014 so they could sell it.\n\n2. Know what you want and why. \u201cI looked for things that I remembered the story from, or remembered my parents really valuing,\u201d said Brenton, \u201cbut also that I had room for and would use.\u201d For example: A monogrammed keybox his father carried so keys wouldn\u2019t poke holes in his pockets. It\u2019s small, personal and useful.\n\n3. Remember: You\u2019re family. When two antique clocks became a little contentious, because Brenton wanted both and so did his sisters, this realization helped: \u201cI really didn\u2019t want both clocks,\u201d said Brenton. \u201cWhat I really wanted was to keep them in the family.\u201d\n\n4. Hire help. Although I chose to sell most of my parents\u2019 belongings myself through an estate sale, that\u2019s not for everyone. \u201cI knew from the start we wouldn\u2019t be able to do that,\u201d Brenton said. After they sorted the personal items, they brought in professionals. MaxSold, a company their realtor recommended, has 50 years of auction experience and uses social media to liquidate households swiftly.\n\n5. Beware of reverse sticker shock. \u201cLike many people, we thought there was more money in stuff than there really was,\u201d said Brenton. \u201cWe weren\u2019t out to get the highest price, but MaxSold helped us see that the pricing was appropriate for the goal.\u201d\n\n6. Buy yourself peace. In two weeks, MaxSold \u2014 which gets 30 percent of the sale proceeds \u2014 had grouped, photographed, cataloged and auctioned off everything. \u201cFor people in our situation \u2026 this was absolutely worth the money,\u201d Branton said.\n\n7. Listen to your parents. When Isenberg catches herself missing an item, she summons the voice of her mother. \u201cShe would tell me, \u2018You have to let that go, honey. It\u2019s gone. You have what\u2019s important: your memories, your children, your life.\u201d\n\nThe Brenton family house went on the market in November, and sold in January \u2014 11 months after their mom\u2019s death.\n\nNext week: MaxSold\u2019s founder shares tips on how to clear a house and how much the average household of stuff is worth.\n\nSyndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Da Capo Press).
