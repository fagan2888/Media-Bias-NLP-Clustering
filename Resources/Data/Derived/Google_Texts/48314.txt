ANNAPOLIS, Md. (WJZ) — Maryland would make family planning more affordable under a bill in the General Assembly.

Political reporter Pat Warren reports it expands health insurance plans that include contraception to cover more options for women and men.

Family planning through contraception is an element of the Affordable Care Act that supporters consider critical.

“Not every contraception works for every woman, and so it’s really important that they have access that’s affordable to the whole range that’s going to work best for them and their families and whatever their needs are,” said Michelle Siri, Planned Parenthood.

Siri and Dr. Amina Chaudry want to see state health plans cover a wider range of birth control options as well as eliminate most co-payments.

Warren: “In addition to the economic aspect, there’s a medical concern here as well.”

Chaudry: “Absolutely. We know that family planning is associated with improved maternal and child health outcomes.”

“I’m really pleased that here in Maryland you’re taking the lead on filling some of the gaps in the Affordable Care Act,” said U.S. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, (D) 8th Congressional District.

Maryland Congressman Chris Van Hollen left Capitol Hill to testify in favor of the bill.

“You see so many Republicans and Tea Party folks trying to turn back the clock on the Affordable Care Act,” said Van Hollen.

Maryland health insurers are also raising objections to aspects of the bill that limit or eliminate their control.

If passed, this would be the most comprehensive expansion of contraceptive insurance coverage in the country.

The bill also covers male contraception.
