Rick Snyder is at Gentex Corporation Headquarters in Zeeland to announce a new jobs initiative called Talent 2025. The event comes right after news broke that Michigan\u2019s unemployment rate fell to 7.4 percent, the lowest level since 2008. Nevertheless, Michigan\u2019s unemployment rate is still higher than the national average of 6.1 percent.\n\nAlso, First Lady Sue Snyder said she will help her husband in his re-election bid, but doesn\u2019t like campaigning all that much. Nevertheless, with the last of her children off to college, she can be a more active First Lady, according to MLive [emphasis mine]:\n\nShe said she\u2019d love to star in a commercial, but the campaign hasn\u2019t asked her to yet. She\u2019s flown under the radar as First Lady up until a few months ago, choosing family life over the limelight. But now that the couple\u2019s youngest child is off to college, Snyder has taken a more active role as First Lady. She has taken on a number of causes recently, and appeared at Sparrow Hospital Thursday to talk about safe sleep. She\u2019s also advocated for vaccinating children, gotten involved in a foster care organization and served as a spokesperson for Ele\u2019s Place, a center for grieving children. \u201cMost of my issues, besides breast cancer, have a lot to do with families and kids. And I just think it\u2019s so important that I can use my voice, my position as First Lady to raise awareness to these things, and they all so important,\u201d Snyder said. On some level, she\u2019s lived and breathed issues in the state for the past four years. The governor brings his work home with him \u201cevery night,\u201d Snyder said. She has disagreed with some of Governor Snyder\u2019s decisions, but only until he\u2019s fully explained them to her. \u201cI wish that these people could be there to understand what he tells me. Why can\u2019t he just stand up and say \u2018people this is the way it is and this is why it happened\u2019? And I\u2019m constantly telling him that,\u201d she said.\n\nOne of those issues he may have to explain to conservatives regarding his decision to expand Medicaid in the state. Last week, Gov. Snyder reiterated his support for this policy initiative, saying it has helped low-income Michigan residents.\n\nHis Democratic opponent, former Congressman Mark Schauer, agreed with Gov. Snyder\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid, but said, \u201cit took him a long time to get it done.\u201d\n\nIn an ad from the Democratic Governors Association, Schauer hit Snyder saying he \u201cgave $1.8 billion in tax breaks to businesses -- even if they send jobs overseas.\u201d That benefits the wealthy in Michigan, according to Schauer. And he noted how in Congress he supported \u201cBuy American\u201d laws to curb outsourcing.\n\nA fact check noted Schauer\u2019s claim about Snyder\u2019s tax breaks benefiting only the wealthy wasn\u2019t entirely accurate. Also, the claim about tax breaks for businesses even those who ship jobs overseas is \u201cmostly true, but misleading\u201d (via Detroit Free Press):\n\nClaim: \"Gov. Snyder gave $1.8 billion in tax breaks to businesses -- even if they send jobs overseas.\" Reality: Mostly true, but misleading. In 2011, the Republican-controlled Legislature passed, and Snyder signed, what amounted to a $1.8-billion tax cut when fully implemented by eliminating the Michigan Business Tax and replacing it with a 6% corporate tax only paid by \"C\" corporations, which have shareholders. A \"tax break\" generally connotes a deduction or loophole allowing certain taxpayers to avoid taxes that would otherwise be owed. Elimination of the MBT was an across-the-board elimination of a tax and in that sense not a tax break. Also, the 6% corporate tax that replaced the MBT was designed as a much cleaner tax that did away with the myriad credits and other \"tax breaks\" that characterized the widely loathed MBT. It's true the MBT was eliminated for all businesses, whether they move jobs overseas or not. But it's worth noting the only companies that have opted to continue paying the MBT are those who received significant MBT tax credits under the former administration of Gov. Jennifer Granholm, a Democrat, and want to be able to use them. Claim: \"That helps the wealthy, but not the rest of Michigan.\" Reality: Mostly false. Most businesses who paid the MBT were small businesses. Most businesses that pay the 6% corporate tax -- \"C\"\n\nThe race is a statistical dead heat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Race is tight..05/27/2016 8:56:53AM EST.", "author": "Matt Vespa", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Race is tight.", "title": "Matt Vespa - MI GOV: Snyder Announces New Jobs Initiative, Schauer Hits Him Over Outsourcing", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/09/22/mi-gov-snyder-announces-new-jobs-initiative-schauer-hits-him-over-outsourcing-n1895052", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2010/209/2617ab39-074a-419a-9036-baef303ccb30@news.ap.org.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Race is tight.", "title": "Matt Vespa - MI GOV: Snyder Announces New Jobs Initiative, Schauer Hits Him Over Outsourcing", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/mattvespa/2014/09/22/mi-gov-snyder-announces-new-jobs-initiative-schauer-hits-him-over-outsourcing-n1895052", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2010/209/2617ab39-074a-419a-9036-baef303ccb30@news.ap.org.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "MI GOV: Snyder Announces New Jobs Initiative, Schauer Hits Him Over Outsourcing, Matt Vespa, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Snyder gave $1.8 billion in tax breaks to businesses -- even if they send jobs overseas.\"\nA fact check noted Schauer\u2019s claim about Snyder\u2019s tax breaks benefiting only the wealthy wasn\u2019t entirely accurate.\nAlso, the claim about tax breaks for businesses even those who ship jobs overseas is \u201cmostly true, but misleading\u201d (via Detroit Free Press):Claim: \"Gov.\nRick Snyder is at Gentex Corporation Headquarters in Zeeland to announce a new jobs initiative called Talent 2025.\nIt's true the MBT was eliminated for all businesses, whether they move jobs overseas or not."}
