Because, you see, we need to protect the environment, and we need a government cudgel with which to do it. We need a gigantic, unaccountable, malevolent, incompetent and lawless agency with which to \u201csave\u201d the beauty of the world around us. Instead, it\u2019s responsible for one of the worst environmental disasters in recent memory.\n\nThe EPA\u2019s release of 3 million gallons of toxic sludge into a major river system now affecting three states is exactly what all of us should expect from our federal government. It\u2019s a perfect example of what we\u2019ve allowed to occur with a government so big it\u2019s impossible to function properly and when it does get out of its lounge chair it makes things worse.\n\nEPA Chief Gina McCarthy says she takes full responsibility for the disaster. I suppose she had no choice but to admit her agency was at fault, as blaming George W. Bush or the Koch Brothers or conservatives in general does have its limits.\n\nFor some perspective on the damage, CNN reports water sampled from the Animas River in Colorado after the spill \u201ccontained extremely high levels of arsenic, cadmium, beryllium and mercury. It also contained zinc, iron and copper.\u201d In the case of lead, it tested at 12,000 times the normal level.\n\nIn the aftermath of the atrocity, Ms. McCarthy has declared that the Animas River is \u201crestoring itself\u201d and is already back to \u201cpre-event conditions.\u201d Ms. McCarthy did \u201ctour\u201d the site last week. Maybe just her presence changed the now arsenic and lead polluted waters into a magical clean. This, despite the fact that experts and environmentalists have voiced concern that the heavy metal sludge will simply settle at the bottom of the rivers, remaining as a contaminant for years to come.\n\nBut why mention that unpleasant fact when you can just declare it fixed. I bet BP would have loved that solution after the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster. \u201cThe ocean is restoring itself. Yeehaw.\u201d\n\nFor some reason, the EPA tried very hard to keep the EPA contractor responsible for the spill from the public eye. Unfortunately for them, another alphabetical, this time the WSJ, ruined their plan and revealed Environmental Restoration (ER) LLC was the \u201ccontractor whose work caused a mine spill in Colorado that released an estimated 3 million gallons of toxic sludge into a major river system.\u201d\n\nThis same WSJ report indicated the subcontractor responsible for the spill has received 381 million dollars from taxpayers since 2007.\n\nLike tentacles of an octopus gone mad, every agency has gone off the rails with the EPA providing just the latest punch in the head. First, we have the Department of Justice (DOJ) deliberately sending guns into the hands of drug cartels and other criminals.\n\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) facilitating Obamacare, a massive and already failed program ostensibly meant to lower health care costs but sending the cost of getting health care into the stratosphere and making good health care an unattainable luxury only for the rich.\n\nThe Veterans Administration (VA) ignoring veterans to death. Literally.\n\nThe IRS becoming a weaponized agency targeting conservatives.\n\nAnd now the EPA, another alphabet with a noble moniker that no one can disagree with, but whose very existence makes everything worse.\n\nIncompetence is one thing, and malevolence and corruption quite another. When the government has turned its bureaucrats into vile henchmen you know failure up and down the line is inevitable. The EPA is no exception.\n\nWhile the toxic sludge river spill is in the news now, don\u2019t forget these other headlines providing a little sample of the nature of that agency and every aspect of the federal government:\n\n\u2022 \u201cEPA denies pressuring Navajos into waiving rights to future payments in river disaster.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cJudge rules EPA lied about transparency, tells agency to halt discrimination against conservatives.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201d \u2018Doing an IRS\u2019? EPA can\u2019t find top official\u2019s text messages.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u201cPoll: \u2018Only 32 percent \u2026 view the EPA favorably.\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u2022 \u201cEPA commits $100K to \u2018addressing bed bugs in rural Alaska.\u2019 \u201c\n\nWhen they\u2019re not polluting a major waterway with toxic arsenic sludge, what else is the EPA doing to \u201cprotect the environment\u201d? Banning wood stoves.\n\nAs Forbes reports, \u201cThe EPA has recently banned the production and sale of 80 percent of America\u2019s current wood-burning stoves, the oldest heating method known to mankind and mainstay of rural homes and many of our nation\u2019s poorest residents. \u2026\u201d Control and punishment, that\u2019s all it\u2019s about.\n\nAmerica is awash in malevolent alphabets: The DOJ, HHS, IRS, DHS, EPA to name a few. Agencies which must exist, we\u2019re told, for our own good. Because life without them would be hell. Agencies we pay for because we want what the Founders wanted: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nThe reality, however, is the federal government and its powerful and lawless enforcers (aka \u201cagencies\u201d) have become nothing more than incompetent and malevolent gangs, looking out only for themselves while executing a mission to control and punish the citizen.\n\n\u2022 Tammy Bruce is a radio talk show host.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Imagine an agency charged with protecting the environment, aptly named the Environmental Protection Agency.
