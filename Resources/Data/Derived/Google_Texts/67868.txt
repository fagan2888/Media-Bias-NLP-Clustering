Stand-up comedy legend Jerry Seinfeld might dismiss the gender gap in comedy as “p.c. nonsense,” but “SNL” alum Will Ferrell doesn’t seem to. Ferrell, along with Adam McKay and Chris Henchy, has launched a female-focused production company under their 7-year-old company, Gary Sanchez Productions, which has produced comedies like “Anchorman 2″ and “Bridesmaids,” reports Deadline.

Longtime Gary Sanchez executive Jessica Ebaum will head the new division. “When Jessica came to us with this idea, we thought it was fantastic,” Ferrell and McKay said in a statement. “She has worked with some of the great female voices in comedy and has proven herself as a gifted producer who has a keen eye for material.”
