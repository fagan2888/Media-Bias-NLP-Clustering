Organizations are pressing for successful implementation of the models. The paper explores how patient education is a component in driving ACO goals across multiple fronts.\n\n\u201cOf the 33 measures under Medicare shared savings program (MSSP) 27/33 measures would benefit from educational components of the care plan\u201d\n\nDr. Steven Merahn, Director for the Center of Population Health, Clinovations\n\nThe National Transitions of Care Coalition has cited patient education as a required component of post hospital health management and disease prevention framework. Today\u2019s technologies and digital delivery options allow health providers to target reductions in re-admissions, and emergency department visits, while improving patient compliance and patient safety within the hospital. In addition to re-admissions reduction one of the market drivers examined in the white paper is patient satisfaction.\n\nPatient Focused Health Education: A Key Driver In Accountable Care gives an overview of patient education tools, defining high quality patient education and how it supports and aligns with U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services goals, and what this can mean for patients and health providers. Quality patient education delivered at the point-of-need has a lasting health impact.\n\nThe whitepaper examines national quality strategy goals and how they are converging to place a national priority on effective patient education. The paper outlines criteria for evaluating patient education such as the foundation on adult learning principles, medical best practices and healthcare national guidelines. Components of quality video health education as it relates to patient empowerment and better outcomes is defined, along with what factors to consider, and how best to impact the patients self-management process.\n\nThe whitepaper was created in conjunction with a webinar series on the same topic co-produced with industry experts. The first webinar, \"The Role of Patient Education in Accountable Care and Population Health\" was done in partnership with Clinovations, Center for Population Health.\n\nPatient education can be provided whenever and wherever it is needed by combining effective education programs with today\u2019s technology providers.
