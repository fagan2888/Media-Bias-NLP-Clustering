John Lewis.\n\n\"There are those who contend that it does not benefit African-Americans to get them into the University of Texas where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less-advanced school, a slower-track school where they do well,\" Scalia said Wednesday during oral arguments in a case involving a race-conscious college admissions plan. The 79-year-old justice, speaking to a hushed courtroom, then referenced a friend-of-the-court brief filed in the case. \"One of the briefs pointed out that most of the black scientists in this country don't come from schools like the University of Texas,\" he said, \"they come from lesser schools where they do not feel that they're being pushed ahead in classes that are too fast for them.\"\n\nScalia said he wasn't \"impressed\" that the University of Texas may have fewer African Americans. \"Maybe it ought to have fewer. And maybe some -- you know, when you take more, the number of blacks, really competent blacks admitted to lesser schools, turns out to be less.\"\n\nReid took to the Senate floor Thursday to condemn Scalia's statements. Lewis, a civil rights icon who marched in Selma, released a statement saying he was \"shocked and amazed\" by Scalia. \"His suggestion that African Americans would fare better at schools that are 'less advanced' or on a 'slow track' reminds me of the kind of prejudice that led to separate and unequal school systems\u2014a policy the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional decades ago,\" Lewis said.\n\nRead More", "article_metadata": {"description": "Supreme Court released audio of controversial comments made by Scalia suggesting that some African-Americans might be better off at \"less-advanced\"universities", "pubdate": "2015-12-11T19:38:16Z", "author": "Ariane de Vogue, CNN Supreme Court Reporter", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Supreme Court released audio of controversial comments made by Scalia suggesting that some African-Americans might be better off at \"less-advanced\"universities", "pubdate": "2015-12-11T19:38:16Z", "title": "Audio: Justice Scalia on black students at top schools", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/11/politics/supreme-court-antonin-scalia-african-americans-audio/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151210083227-scalia-september-15-2014-large-169.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/151210083227-scalia-september-15-2014-large-169.jpg", "template-top": "politics,art-vid", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/11/politics/supreme-court-antonin-scalia-african-americans-audio/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, Audio: Justice Scalia on black students at top schools - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2015-12-11T21:34:33Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Scalia said he wasn't \"impressed\" that the University of Texas may have fewer African Americans.\nThe 79-year-old justice, speaking to a hushed courtroom, then referenced a friend-of-the-court brief filed in the case.\nLewis, a civil rights icon who marched in Selma, released a statement saying he was \"shocked and amazed\" by Scalia.\nAnd maybe some -- you know, when you take more, the number of blacks, really competent blacks admitted to lesser schools, turns out to be less.\"\n\"One of the briefs pointed out that most of the black scientists in this country don't come from schools like the University of Texas,\" he said, \"they come from lesser schools where they do not feel that they're being pushed ahead in classes that are too fast for them.\""}
