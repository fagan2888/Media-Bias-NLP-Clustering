A membership provides unlimited access to everything they offer.\n\nThink of it like a gym.\n\nMembership for a single adult runs $79 a month, membership for a couple costs $109 a month and each additional child in the family is $19 a month.\n\nDr. Jon Osborne, one of the doctors who started it all, said it\u2019s working.\n\n\u201cAnything we do inside these four walls including: x-rays, EKGs, simple in-house labs, stitches, a shot of antibiotics, a shot of steroids, anything in the building is included in that membership at no charge,\u201d Osborne said.\n\nNo co-pays, no insurance, just a monthly membership.\n\nDr. Osborne and his partners wanted to try something different when they were faced with changes during the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWhat we realized is when you take out the insurance middle man, you take out some parts of the government that I don\u2019t have to deal with anymore, and you look at how much you can save by running a practice, it\u2019s about forty cents on the dollar,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cSo on average, for every dollar you collect in primary care you spend 40 cents collecting it.\u201d\n\nMembers come from Shasta, Trinity and Tehama counties.\n\nMarsha Flinn and her husband make the drive from Red Bluff.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had an x-ray, I\u2019ve had blood work, and we started in February,\u201d Flinn said. \u201cIt\u2019s just been wonderful. All of our medical needs have been addressed here.\u201d\n\nDr. Osborne recommended coupling a membership with a high deductible catastrophic insurance, and establishing a health savings account to use pretax dollars for prescriptions or other healthcare needs.\n\nThey opened four months ago and are currently more than three-quarters of the way to their goal of serving either 400 families or 1200 members.\n\nDr. Osborne said once the west Redding location is filled with members, they plan to open another clinic in east Redding and a third clinic in Cottonwood.\n\nPrestige Urgent Care can still be used as a walk-in clinic. It costs non-members $95 to visit.", "article_metadata": {"ib-analytics": "data", "description": "Prestige Urgent Care in Redding offers medical care at the cost of membership, not insurance.", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "KRCR", "og": {"site_name": "KRCRTV", "description": "Prestige Urgent Care in Redding offers medical care at the cost of membership, not insurance.", "title": "Redding clinic offering alternative health coverage", "url": "http://www.krcrtv.com/living/health/redding-clinic-offering-alternative-health-coverage/26298408", "image": "http://www.krcrtv.com/image/view/-/26297830/medRes/2/-/maxh/640/maxw/640/-/1giy4hz/-/Prestige-Urgent-Care--1-.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.krcrtv.com/living/health/redding-clinic-offering-alternative-health-coverage/26298408", "site": "@krcr7", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 326090907430922}, "keywords": "Redding health news", "google-site-verification": "gTTyxbmKN17E5sKQVjUGk8TIpxo_XoD5X2_F3PXfucg", "news_keywords": "Redding health news"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd5c3\"", "article_summary": "The west Redding clinic doesn\u2019t have patients, it has members.\nREDDING, Calif. -Prestige Urgent Care in Redding offers medical care at the cost of membership, not insurance.\nDr. Osborne said once the west Redding location is filled with members, they plan to open another clinic in east Redding and a third clinic in Cottonwood.\nPrestige Urgent Care can still be used as a walk-in clinic.\nDr. Jon Osborne, one of the doctors who started it all, said it\u2019s working."}
