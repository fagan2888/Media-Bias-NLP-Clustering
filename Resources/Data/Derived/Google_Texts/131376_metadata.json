Socialislamofascist-redistributionish-communitarian.\n\nOfficial 1981 portrait of President Reagan, deficit-spending libtard. President Reagan raised Social Security taxes five times .\n\nNow you might notice that Barack Obama is the 44th President of the United States and I said 43 presidents would be considered libtards today. This is because Grover Cleveland was elected in non-consecutive terms and was both 22nd and 24th president.\n\nEvery president of the U.S. would be considered a libtard by today\u2019s Republican base.\n\nSo what\u2019s the point?\n\nIt\u2019s not that all these presidents were great. Some of them, such as Warren Harding, were involved in massive corruption scandals like The Teapot Dome scandal. Buchanan and Pierce supported slavery even sough to justify it using the Constitution. Nixon had Watergate. Jefferson owned slaves.\n\nThe point is not to argue either way for any one president or another. The point is to illustrate how far to the right we\u2019ve swung over the past 40 years.\n\nWhat\u2019s it take to be a Republican these days?\n\nThe answer, so far as I can tell, is rage. Rage that blots out everything else to the point where the only thing that matters is destroying the government. If you do anything else, you are considered a libtard.\n\nThis is why John Boehner is a libtard.\n\nThis is why Mitch McConnell is a libtard.\n\nThis is why Eric Cantor was booted from office.\n\nThis is why Paul Ryan is now a libtard.\n\nAll of these people took positions of leadership in government and compromised at some point, for the good of the United States. And even if the compromise was the smallest, tiniest of compromises, this is unacceptable in today\u2019s Republican-base land.\n\nWe see this rage against the U.S. government, \u201cof the people, by the people, for the people,\u201d manifested in the sad Bundy militia standoff in Oregon.\n\nAsk a conservative: If there\u2019s corruption in the government, what should we do? The answers, inevitably, are:\n\nGet rid of the corruption. Destroy the government.\n\nSadly, the folks I\u2019ve talked to lately seem to think in terms of No. 2.\n\nHow do you work with people who will call you a libtard the moment you want to try to accomplish anything?\n\nIt seems pretty darn near impossible, since their only desire is destruction.\n\nThere is only one party moving further and further out there in our country since the 1980s. It is the one forming militias. It is the one that believes airplane exhaust is some type of mind-controlling chemical and the government has secret weather machines.\n\nPercentage of centrists in Congress over time (Poole and Rosental metric).\n\nWhat to do?\n\nBuild something without them. Work to figure out how to get the money out of politics. Support people who believe in this goal. Convince the independents. Realize that words are just words. They can\u2019t hurt you. The idea is simply to make you mad. And they don\u2019t really even make sense anymore. All of our presidents would be considered libtards by today\u2019s Republican base.\n\nLibtard is just a negative word for someone they don\u2019t like. If someone calls you a libtard, call them a socialist. Or a freedom-hating, reverse-racist, gay-loving New Yorker subscriber.\n\nI\u2019m a socialist? Well, I heard you listen to NPR!\n\nIt\u2019s just nonsense.\n\nSillyland sometimes calls for silly tactics to point out the silliness. (NOTE: Please maintain that you would much rather have a rational conversation. But if you\u2019re going to be called a libtard, why not have some fun with it?)\n\nWe are all libtards now.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Recently, I got into a discussion with some conservatives\u00a0about whether Paul Ryan was a Muslim-loving socialist RINO.\u00a0 \r\n\r\n I love these types of discussions because it gives me the chance to ask ques", "title": "43 U.S. presidents who would be considered 'libtards' today", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2016/1/17/1469746/-43-U-S-presidents-who-would-be-considered-libtards-today", "image": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/195865/story_image/01_Washington_915.jpg?1452802307", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "Recently, I got into a discussion with some conservatives\u00a0about whether Paul Ryan was a Muslim-loving socialist RINO.\u00a0\r\n\r\nI love these types of discussions because it gives me the chance to ask que...", "title": "43 U.S. presidents who would be considered 'libtards' today", "image": {"src": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/195865/story_image/01_Washington_915.jpg?1452802307"}, "creator": "@akadjian", "site": "@dailykos", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "article_summary": "Now you might notice that Barack Obama is the 44th President of the United States and I said 43 presidents would be considered libtards today.\nAll of our presidents would be considered libtards by today\u2019s Republican base.\nPassed legislation to reform Wall Street and the Consumer Protection Act.\nEvery president of the U.S. would be considered a libtard by today\u2019s Republican base.\nLyndon B.
