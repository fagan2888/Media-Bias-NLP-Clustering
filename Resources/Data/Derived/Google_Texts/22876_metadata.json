Of course, CMS had to pass it so you could find out what\u2019s in it, assuming you can actually understand what\u2019s in it:\n\nIn \u00a7 438.3(o), we proposed that contracts covering LTSS [Long-Term Services and Support] provide that services that could be authorized through a waiver under section 1915(c) of the Act or a state plan amendment through section 1915(i) or 1915(k) of the Act be delivered consistent with the settings standards in \u00a7 441.301(c)(4).\n\nHealth Affairs has a roughly 5,600-word summary of the regulations here.
