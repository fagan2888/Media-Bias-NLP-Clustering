Meanwhile, according to research by Post Office Travel Money, the pound will buy up to 18 per cent more travel cash than this time last year in destinations such as Malaysia and Mexico.\n\nSpokesman Andrew Brown said: \u2018With Egypt off-sale to UK visitors for the moment, bargain hunters who would normally head to Sharm el Sheikh in Egypt after Christmas could find Mexico the strongest contender to take its place.\n\nThe strength of sterling against currencies for long haul destinations like Mexico, Malaysia and Mauritius will make them appealing to holidaymakers looking for higher temperatures Andrew Brown, Post Office Travel Money spokesman\n\n\u2018At \u00a3756 per person for a week in January, Cancun was the cheapest long-haul beach resort surveyed. An 11 per cent year-on-year drop in the Mexican peso\u2019s value gives visitors \u00a350 extra on a \u00a3500 currency exchange.\u2019\n\nHowever, the best-value holidays over the New Year can be found closer to home in Cyprus and Lanzarote.\n\nThe lowest-priced destination outside Europe is the Florida theme-park capital of Orlando, where a week\u2019s holiday including meals is just \u00a3692 per person \u2013 despite the relative weakness of sterling against the US dollar.\n\nMr Brown added: \u2018The great value we found in Orlando just goes to show that holidaymakers planning trips really need to look at both the package price and the cost of eating out.\n\n\u2018Even though the US dollar remains stubbornly stronger against the pound, prices are low in Orlando and package costs are looking very reasonable.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Holiday,price,war,big,firms,cut,package,deals,800,Terror,attacks,hit,bookings,Tunisia,Egypt,Turkey", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3374314/Holiday-price-war-big-firms-cut-package-deals-800-Terror-attacks-hit-bookings-Tunisia-Egypt-Turkey.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Big package holiday companies are battling for bookings and are now are pushing alternative long-haul destinations such as Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Sri Lanka.", "title": "Holiday price war as big firms cut package deals by more than \u00a3800", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3374314/Holiday-price-war-big-firms-cut-package-deals-800-Terror-attacks-hit-bookings-Tunisia-Egypt-Turkey.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/25/23/03FDC779000005DC-0-image-a-5_1451087681012.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3374314/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3374314/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 3374314, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Holiday,price,war,big,firms,cut,package,deals,800,Terror,attacks,hit,bookings,Tunisia,Egypt,Turkey", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2015-12-25T23:55:15.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Sean+Poulter+for+the+Daily+Mail", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-12-26T08:26:42.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Holiday price war big firms cut package deals 800 Terror attacks hit bookings Tunisia Egypt Turkey"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Big package holiday companies are battling for bookings and are now are pushing alternative long-haul destinations such as Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Sri Lanka.", "title": "Holiday price war as big firms cut package deals by more than \u00a3800", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3374314/Holiday-price-war-big-firms-cut-package-deals-800-Terror-attacks-hit-bookings-Tunisia-Egypt-Turkey.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/25/23/03FDC779000005DC-0-image-a-5_1451087681012.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2015/12/15/8743358929999777503/1024x576_8743358929999777503.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Big package holiday companies are battling for bookings and are now are pushing alternative long-haul destinations such as Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Sri Lanka."}, "article_summary": "The post-Christmas period is crucial for sales and firms including Thomson and Thomas Cook are battling to win early bookings.\nHoliday giants are offering savings of more than \u00a3800 on sunshine breaks in a fierce new price war.\nThomas Cook is promising savings of up to \u00a3400 per booking, child places for \u00a31 and thousands of breaks for less than \u00a3400 per person.\n\u2018Even though the US dollar remains stubbornly stronger against the pound, prices are low in Orlando and package costs are looking very reasonable.\nAs well as money-off deals, Thomson and sister brand First Choice say they are offering thousands of free child places and low-deposit bookings."}
