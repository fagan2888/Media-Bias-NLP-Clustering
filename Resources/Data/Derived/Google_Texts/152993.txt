About 9.9 million people got health insurance coverage through the marketplaces set up by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as of June 30, a decline from earlier in the year though still higher than the Obama administration’s target.

About 84 percent got government subsidies to buy the coverage, getting an average of $270 a month, according to data released by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Enrollment had been 10.2 million at the end of March.

The administration has set a year-end goal of insuring at least 9.1 million people via policies bought in the insurance marketplaces. People fall off the rolls when they stop paying for the insurance. Sometimes that means they’re getting coverage elsewhere, for instance because they’ve married or gotten a job that offers health benefits.

“Millions of Americans are benefiting from the peace of mind that comes with having quality coverage at a price they can afford,” Sylvia Burwell, secretary of the Department of Health & Human Services, said in a statement.
