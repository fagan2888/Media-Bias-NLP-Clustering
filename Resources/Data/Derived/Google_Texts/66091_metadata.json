Frustrated by almost eight years of attacks on their faith and their values, America\u2019s Christians are fired up to make a difference in the 2016 election. And with record turnout numbers, they are. In South Carolina, conservative voting was up 12 points \u2014 shattering the marks set in 2012. In the southern states where the race rolls next, schools in Virginia and elsewhere are so concerned about the number of primary voters that they\u2019re canceling classes \u2014 a move usually reserved for the general election.\n\nAs CBN\u2019s David Brody points out, their anger is about a lot more than President Obama. \u201cEvangelicals are upset with the Republican Party too. They\u2019ve felt like cheap political pawns for years, constantly being used by the GOP to get out and vote and then having nothing to show for it.\u201d But if pundits thought they could predict where these conservatives would channel their exasperation, they were wrong. Three very different men lead the Republican field, and it\u2019ll take broad evangelical support for any of them to win the nomination.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that evangelicals have the influence \u2014 but are they using it wisely? Some aren\u2019t so sure. Any conservative who watched the returns from South Carolina had to be troubled by these two takeaways: 1) the evangelical vote is split; and 2) many of their votes are going to candidates inconsistent with the values evangelicals embrace. Supporting Planned Parenthood, debt-ballooning entitlements, pro-abortion Supreme Court justices, and the Obamacare mandate is hardly the stuff of conservatism. It\u2019s obvious, George Will wrote, the frontrunner of the Republican Party is not, as President Obama suggested, \u201csaying in more interesting ways what the other [GOP] candidates are saying.\u201d In what universe is giving money to liberal campaigns, praising the \u201cvery good work\u201d of the nation\u2019s biggest abortion business, or owning strip clubs and casinos conservative?\n\nStill, the nomination race, as John Fund explains on National Review Online, is far from decided. But for a party very much on the edge, Saturday should have been a wake-up call to America. It\u2019s time for every voter \u2014 evangelicals especially \u2014 to go beyond rhetoric to records. Just because a candidate channels your frustration or speaks to your fears doesn\u2019t mean he shares your values. And in the end, values are what policies are based on. Not good intentions, not zinging soundbites, not even campaign promises. What Barack Obama said in 2008 was far more moderate than what President Obama did in 2009 and beyond.\n\nSouth Carolina, the editors of NRO warn, should \u201conly increase the urgency and focus of conservatives who believe that our ideas and principles are the only way to make America great again.\u201d If voters want to undo the mess of the last two terms, it will take a principled leader with a solid record.

His homily at the funeral of his father, perhaps the greatest Supreme Court justice of a generation, may have been one of the most powerful events Washington has ever seen. From the first minute of the ceremony, it was obvious to everyone that something was different. Chief Justice William Rehnquist\u2019s funeral was not like it. President Reagan\u2019s, though large and presidential and \u201cstately,\u201d was not like it. This was the Gospel of Jesus Christ on display in a service so inspirational that even the liberal media stood in awe.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not difficult to understand why. Father Scalia defined the day almost immediately, saying, \u201cWe are gathered here because of one man, a man known personally to many of us, known only by reputation to many more; a man loved by many, scorned by others; a man known for great controversy and for great compassion,\u201d and then he turned: \u201cThat man, of course, is Jesus of Nazareth.\u201d\n\nAll of the cable channels were silent for two hours as if they were speechless, FRC\u2019s Cathy Ruse observed. \u201cIt was as if the \u2018hounds of hell\u2019 were kept at bay. The nation and world were taught the central meaning of our faith and of Scalia\u2019s \u2014 that Jesus died for his sins personally. And everyone watched quietly and learned. Tragic deaths often seem inexplicable and we long to learn God\u2019s plan but usually we have to wait until the general judgment before all will be made clear. But perhaps we have been given a glimpse of the Divine plan in this tragedy.\u201d Father Scalia made it clear from the beginning of the Mass for his father that, instead of honoring his dad, they were there to \u201creflect what God did for Dad. How he blessed him!\u201d\n\nIt was a remarkable time of respecting Justice Scalia\u2019s own wishes, which he wrote to an evangelical pastor years earlier: \u201cEven when the deceased was an admirable person, indeed especially when the deceased was an admirable person, praise for his virtues can cause us to forget that we are praying for and giving thanks for God\u2019s inexplicable mercy to a sinner.\u201d Father Paul\u2019s message more than accomplished that. It spoke encouragement and comfort to believers and pointed those outside faith in Christ to the source of hope. Which I am certain is exactly what Justice Scalia would have wanted. He lived his life loving God and his country. And in death, he brought America closer to both.\n\nOriginally published here.\n\nCalvary Calls in the Cavalry on Prayer\n\nThe Freedom from Religion Foundation may like to pick fights with local school districts \u2013 but Chino Valley Unified is no ordinary place. Unlike a lot of schools boards in the country, this one isn\u2019t afraid to stand up for what it believes \u2014 including the Christian faith that several members practice. A majority of the board\u2019s members attend the church of a good Watchmen pastor friend of ours: Jack Hibbs\u2019s Calvary Chapel Chino Hills (CCCH).\n\n[Sunday], I had the privilege of once again preaching the Sunday services at CCCH where I encouraged them to live their lives as followers of Jesus with no fear. And that is exactly what they planned to do. They have no plans to retreat from the challenge of any anti-Christian organization. \u201cWhether people like or not,\u201d Pastor Jack has said, \u201creligion is part of the fiber of America. And we encourage our congregation to speak the truth in the public square.\u201d That courage starts at the top and has continued through the church\u2019s 10,000-person congregation.\n\nSo when FFRF sued the school board for opening the meetings with prayer and reading from the Bible, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that members of Pastor Jack\u2019s church didn\u2019t back down. With help from the Pacific Justice Institute, the board\u2019s Christians refuse to give in to this secular arm-twisting and have taken their convictions to court, where they argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent Greece decision about public prayer not only applies to local legislatures but school boards as well!\n\nLast week, a judge disagreed, temporarily ordering the board to stop injecting faith into meetings, claiming it was an \u201cunconstitutional endorsement of religion.\u201d For now, District Judge Jesus Bernal is banning the members from \u201cconducting, permitting, or otherwise endorsing school-sponsored prayer.\u201d Well, FFRF may have had the last word, but they won\u2019t have the final one. Chino Valley Unified is vowing to fight the ruling \u2014 and even defy it, if necessary. \u201cNo law is going to stop people from praying,\u201d Pastor Jack vowed. America would be a different place if there were more churches like Calvary Chapel Chino Hills \u2013 unafraid to use their religious freedom to preserve their freedoms and touch the lives of those living in their communities.\n\nOriginally published here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If there's one thing President Obama has done for evangelicals, it's motivate them.
