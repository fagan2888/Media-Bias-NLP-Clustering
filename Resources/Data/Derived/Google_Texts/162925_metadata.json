Back in November, Washington Post writer Richard Cohen claimed Republicans \u2014 or strangely, people with \u201cconventional views\u201d \u2014 \u201cmust repress a gag reflex\u201d when they saw New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s multiracial family. Amusingly, he drew the ire of fellow leftists who quickly branded him a racist for calling the tea party racist.

Before she made a national disgrace of herself, Americans generally recognized her as the woman wearing tampon earrings and claiming Obamacare was \u201cthe new n-word.\u201d\n\nEven left-leaning publications took issue with MSNBC\u2019s vitriol.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s broadsweeping assumption that all conservatives hate interracial marriage gives you an indication of what they\u2019re all about. \u2014 Dylan Byers (@DylanByers) January 30, 2014\n\nMSNBC has not commented on or apologized for their vulgar tweet as of press time.\n\nUPDATE: MSNBC tweeted an apology late Wednesday evening blaming their unruly Twitter feed for spitting hate autonomously.

It does not reflect the position of msnbc. \u2014 msnbc (@msnbc) January 30, 2014\n\nWe are deleting the earlier offensive tweet.
