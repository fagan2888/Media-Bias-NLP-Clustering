Similar memorandums were sent to school boards in Minnesota and Rhode Island.\n\nAlliance Defending Freedom also provided additional documents outlining alternative actions school districts can take to protect both students and transgender individuals, such as providing transgender students with single-stall restrooms, uni-sex bathrooms or the controlled use of a faculty facility.\n\nBut it\u2019s not like Sparta, a small city of 9,600 in western Wisconsin, is acting alone. More and more school boards in the state and across the country are implementing new guidelines to accommodate transgender individuals, who make up 0.3 percent of the nation\u2019s population.\n\nSteve Starkey, executive director of OutReach, a Wisconsin LGBT community center, said every step should be taken to ensure transgender students can use the bathrooms in which they feel most comfortable. He also praised the Janesville School Board for taking a \u201cproactive\u201d approach in September by changing its policies on bullying prevention and discrimination for transgender pupils.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a really positive step,\u201d Starkey said. \u201cIt\u2019s saying that those transgender individuals are valuable human beings and that they are going to be treated respectfully.\u201d\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "School boards across the country are implementing new guidelines to accommodate transgender individuals, who make up 0.3 percent of the nation\u2019s population.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "School boards across the country are implementing new guidelines to accommodate transgender individuals, who make up 0.3 percent of the nation\u2019s population.", "title": "Groups Ask School Districts to Reconsider Transgender Restroom Policies", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/453125289.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1x6FJsk"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "School boards across the country are implementing new guidelines to accommodate transgender individuals, who make up 0.3 percent of the nation\u2019s population.", "title": "Groups Ask School Districts to Reconsider Transgender Restroom Policies", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/453125289.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12", "published_time": "2014-11-06T09:38:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "transgender, transgender bathrooms, schools, school boards, wisconsin family action, john hendricks,"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s saying that those transgender individuals are valuable human beings and that they are going to be treated respectfully.\u201dRead more at Watchdog.org\nMADISON, Wis. \u2014 Sparta Area School District Superintendent John Hendricks has had little to say about his proposal to allow transgender students to use school restrooms of the gender with which they identify.\nAlliance Defending Freedom also provided additional documents outlining alternative actions school districts can take to protect both students and transgender individuals, such as providing transgender students with single-stall restrooms, uni-sex bathrooms or the controlled use of a faculty facility.\nMore and more school boards in the state and across the country are implementing new guidelines to accommodate transgender individuals, who make up 0.3 percent of the nation\u2019s population.\nHe also praised the Janesville School Board for taking a \u201cproactive\u201d approach in September by changing its policies on bullying prevention and discrimination for transgender pupils."}
