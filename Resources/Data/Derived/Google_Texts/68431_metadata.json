A product with orphan designation is eligible to receive free protocol and scientific advice from EMA, and if approved, can receive 10 years of market exclusivity.\n\nOrphan product designation was first introduced in the EU in 2000 under Regulation (EC) No 141/2000.\n\nTo qualify for orphan product designation, a treatment must fit several criteria:\n\nThe medicine must treat, prevent or diagnose a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition.\n\nThe condition must affect fewer than 5 in 10,000 people in the EU. Alternatively, if a condition affects more than 5 in 10,000 people in the EU it may still be considered for orphan designation if it is \u201cunlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development.\u201d\n\nThere must be no existing approved treatments for the indicated condition, or if there are, the product in question must offer significant improvements over the other options.\n\nEMA recommended 17 drugs with orphan product designation for approval in 2014, the highest number by the agency in a single year.\n\nAccess to Treatment Still a Struggle\n\nDespite improvements made at EMA and EC, Andersen finds the differences in level of care in different European nations to be problematic.\n\nAccording to Andersen, patients continue to face two major challenges to their treatment and care.\n\nFirst, patients may face obstacles to obtaining an accurate or timely diagnosis due to a lack of awareness or expertise of a rare disease. Second, for many rare diseases, there may be no approved treatments available. Even in cases where a treatment is available, accessing the treatment could require travelling to a specialized facility, which is difficult or impossible for some patients.\n\nAndersen also thinks the EC could do more to increase awareness of rare diseases at the country level, and says that having varying levels of awareness and care from country to country is unacceptable from the point of view of EU citizens.\n\nBroader Potential\n\nWhile incentives\u2014and the potential for high prices\u2014have piqued the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s interest in rare diseases, Andersen says that developing treatments for rare diseases should eventually benefit other patients as well.\n\nAndersen says that industry is beginning to recognize opportunities to translate \u201ca lot of what is being learned from rare diseases into the development of personalized medicines\u201d in the future.\n\n\"This experience will be also valuable in the future for a broader patient community.\"\n\nEurActiv Interview", "article_metadata": {"Keywords": "EC, EMA, Europe, News, Submission and registration, Regulatory strategy, Government affairs", "Description": "A rare disease advocacy network has applauded the European Medicines Agency&#8217;s (EMA) efforts to incentivize the development of treatments for <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/health/rare_diseases/policy/index_en.htm\">rare diseases</a>, but says\u00a0 the variance in treatment access across the EU is &#8220;unacceptable.&#8221;", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Title": "Rare Disease Patient Group Commends EMA, Wants EU-Wide Access to Treatment"}, "article_summary": "The EU's Regulatory Framework for Rare Disease TreatmentsIn recent years, EMA has worked to promote the development of treatments for rare diseases.\nBroader PotentialWhile incentives\u2014and the potential for high prices\u2014have piqued the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s interest in rare diseases, Andersen says that developing treatments for rare diseases should eventually benefit other patients as well.\nOne of the ways the agency has done so is through the creation of its orphan product designation, which applies to treatments for rare diseases.\nEMA recommended 17 drugs with orphan product designation for approval in 2014, the highest number by the agency in a single year.\nTo qualify for orphan product designation, a treatment must fit several criteria:The medicine must treat, prevent or diagnose a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition."}
