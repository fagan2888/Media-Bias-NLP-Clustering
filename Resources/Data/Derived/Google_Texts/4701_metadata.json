Primary voters will make their choice between the two June 24. Both campaigns are airing attacks ads as the Republican primary draws closer.\n\nDoheny and Stefanik faced off at a debate in Watertown yesterday. Despite the vitriolic ads, the debate was mostly friendly, and the two candidates agreed on most issues.\n\nMatt Doheny and Elise Stefanik are pretty much in the same camp when it comes to federal policy.\n\nThey agree on healthcare. Stefanik says, \u201cI don\u2019t support Obamacare. I stand by the full repeal of Obamacare.\u201d Doheny says, \u201c Obamacare is not the answer.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates are pro-gun, pro-medical marijuana and anti-Common Core. And they\u2019ve both milked a cow.\n\nBut Doheny and Stefanik differ on two major North Country issues: the rooftop highway and border security.\n\nDoheny supports the rooftop highway: \u201dAs someone who\u2019s spent a lot of time on Route 11 going from Watertown to all the stops way over through Plattsburgh, it\u2019s got to be improved.\u201d\n\nElise Stefanik doesn\u2019t support the highway. She says instead, the North Country should improve its existing infrastructure, like rail, roads, waterways and sewers.\n\n\u201cBut there\u2019s also other pieces to infrastructure, like broadband. We need to ensure that our rural communities have that last mile of broadband coverage. We also need to promote cell phone coverage,\u201d Stefanik siad.\n\nStefanik and Doheny also differed on traffic flow across the border with Canada. Stefanik says the North Country has struck the right balance between security and commerce.\n\nDoheny, who grew up on the St. Lawrence River, said border security has gone too far. \u201cIt\u2019s a little too tight,\u201d he said.\n\nDoheny and Stefanik traded barbs as they discussed the 2008 government bailout. They accused each other of being complicit in the bailouts: he on Wall Street, she while working for the White House.\n\n\u201cThis is D.C.double-speak,\u201d Doheny charged. \u201cShe was there but she didn\u2019t believe in it... I mean time and time again.\u201d\n\nStefanik defended her work in the Bush Administration, and shot back, \u201cWere you not on Wall Street? You were on Wall Street!\"\n\nDoheny repeatedly challenged whether Stefanik, who\u2019s worked in politics since graduating from college, could really call herself a small businessperson. In the one direct question he was allowed to ask her, he pressed her again.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re 29. You\u2019ve worked in the Bush White House. You\u2019ve worked in a neo-conservative think tank. You\u2019ve worked on your own blog and you\u2019ve worked on presidential campaigns. I just want people to understand \u2014 how can you call yourself a small businesswoman?\"\n\nAnd she repeated a theme she\u2019d sounded again and again, replying, \u201cBecause I grew up in a small business. When I was a kid I watched my parents risk every dollar they had to start our family business. So yes, our business experience differs, but I believe growing up in a small business based in upstate New York, dealing with small business customers throughout the 21st district, gives me a better understanding of what our economic challenges are on the ground.\"\n\nBut Doheny says he\u2019s the one who will bring jobs to the North Country. \u201cI have a proven record of success, look, I\u2019m a self-made businessman. I understand how hard it is to create, save and maintain jobs. It\u2019s what i\u2019ve done in my career.\u201d\n\nIn the last few minutes, the candidates went into a lightning round, answering questions on policy\u2014and sports team loyalties.\n\n\"In hockey, St. Lawrence or Clarkson?\" NCPR's David Sommerstein asked. Both waffled, until Doheny chose St. Lawrence because he'd attended its hockey camp as a kid. But he laughingly begged Clarkson president Tony Collins not to judge too harshly.\n\nThe Republican primary is coming up on June 24. The winner will face Democratic candidate Aaron Wolf and Green Party candidate Matt Funiciello in the general election this fall.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The clock is ticking for Republican Congressional candidates Matt Doheny and Elise Stefanik.
