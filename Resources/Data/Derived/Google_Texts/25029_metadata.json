Through Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s bold leadership, they are benefitting from a statewide tuition freeze two years running, making college more affordable. The Walker administration\u2019s tuition reform is putting the brakes on skyrocketing costs for higher education in Wisconsin.\n\nAfter years of relentless tuition hikes ranging from 5.5 to 9.3 percent annually, resident undergraduates at our two-year colleges and four-year universities will pay no more for the 2014-\u201915 school year than they did for 2012-\u201913. Ditto the next two years, as Walker has proposed to extend the tuition freeze through the 2016-\u201917 school year. That means UW System students starting school in the fall of 2012 could earn a two-year or four-year degree without ever being hit with a tuition increase.\n\nThey can also take comfort knowing their financial futures will be brighter by carrying a smaller student loan burden combined with better paying job opportunities as Wisconsin\u2019s economy continues to improve.\n\nGov. Scott Walker has been working hard to reverse the long-term trend in student tuition increases, while maintaining the UW System\u2019s national reputation for outstanding higher education opportunities. For that he deserves to be re-elected.\n\nKyle Wagoner,\n\nCuster\n\nRead or Share this story: http://spjour.nl/1tyqhCx", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Gov.
