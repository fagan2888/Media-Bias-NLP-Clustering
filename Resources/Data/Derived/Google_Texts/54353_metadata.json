Paid vacation, paid holidays and paid sick days are some other gains they have achieved.\n\n/ Download\n\nJust last week, the janitorial workers of Houston\u2019s George R. Brown Convention Center ratified a new contract they had been negotiating for months.\n\nThe Texas chapter of the Service Employees International Union \u2013 better known as SEIU \u2013 represented the workers at the bargaining table with Omaha-based Midwest Maintenance. Thanks to the new contract, the GRB janitors will have the same wages as those who work at Houston\u2019s office buildings: $9.35 an hour starting in January.\n\nPaid vacation, paid holidays and paid sick days are some other gains.\n\nAnd paid sick days are pretty important.\n\n\u201cWe were always working because, if we were sick, we couldn\u2019t stay home because we didn\u2019t get paid,\u201d says Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda, who participated in the workers\u2019 bargaining committee.\n\nSEIU spokeswoman Paloma Mart\u00ednez explains the importance of the benefit.\n\n\u201cFor many of the George R. Brown Convention Center worker this is something they may have never experienced in their life, being able to take a day off with pay if you have a cold, if you have a really bad illness and you don\u2019t wanna infect your clients at the convention center,\u201d noted Mart\u00ednez.\n\nThe fact Midwest will take care of washing the workers\u2019 uniforms is also an advantage for them. Until now, they had to do that on their own.\n\nMedical insurance is one difference between this contract and the one office janitors have. Midwest did offer insurance, but the workers rejected it because they concluded it wasn\u2019t affordable.\n\nSEIU says it remains a goal for future negotiations.\n\nFor Garc\u00eda, \u201cit\u2019s important we get medical insurance because we also need it.\u201d\n\nMidwest Maintenance did not respond to our request for comment for this story.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "They will earn $9.35 an hour starting in January.
