Rapid City, SD

Wildlife officials in South Dakota say six mountain lions have been killed so far during the ongoing hunting season in the Black Hills Fire Protection District.

A report from the South Dakota Game Fish and Parks Department shows that five of the six lions killed were females. Four lions were killed in Pennington County and one each in Custer and Meade counties.

The season will conclude on March 31, unless the harvest limit of 75 total mountain lions, or 50 female lions, is reached prior to that date.

The mountain lion season outside of the Black Hills district runs year-round.

The state has had a residents-only mountain lion season since 2005. Unlimited licenses for the season can be obtained through the department.
