Last season, Furniture Row Racing team had its best year with Kurt Busch in the car, becoming the first single-car team to qualify for the Sprint Cup Chase. It finished 10th in points. Busch set team season records with 11 top five finishes and 16 top 10s. He now drives the No. 41 Haas Automation Chevrolet SS for Stewart-Haas Racing and sits 24th in the Sprint Cup Chase with 422 points.

I had the chance to talk with Busch for a story I’m working on about general manager Joe Garone and asked Busch a few questions.

Q: What did you like about working for a single car team like Furniture Row?

A: The ease of communication among team members. A smaller team makes it easier to communicate.

Q: What is your favorite memory from working with the Furniture Row team?

A: It has to be sitting on the pole at Darlington. That race seemed to move us in the right direction of being a top-tier team.

Q: Would you ever attempt to do the double again? (In May, Busch competed in the Indinapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 which is commonly referred to as the double. He finished sixth in the 500 but his car’s engine engine blew on lap 271 in the Coke 600.)

A: It came with a lot of hard work and it was a lot of fun. The amount of responsibility that comes with 1,100 miles in one day can overwhelm you. I’ve had a month or so to digest it. Part of me wants to do it, but part of me says I’ve accomplished what I want to accomplish.
