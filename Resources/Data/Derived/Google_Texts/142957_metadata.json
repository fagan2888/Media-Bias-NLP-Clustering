Someone named Chris McDaniel, a 41-year-old Mississippi state senator, would soon \u201cend speculation\u201d over his plans to run for the U.S. Senate. On Oct. 17, sure enough, McDaniel stood before the Ellisville, Miss. courthouse and confirmed that he would challenge Sen. Thad Cochran, who\u2019s sat behind a Senate desk since 1979.\n\nDavid Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post.\n\n\u201cI am reminded of that first revolution,\u201d said McDaniel, flanked by supporters and a Patton-sized American flag. \u201cI stand here with you, with the silent majority of Americans who believe we can retake this country, who still believe in liberty.\u201d\n\nCochran, the first Republican to win a direct election to one of Mississippi\u2019s Senate seats, did not vote for the Affordable Care Act. But he didn\u2019t vote with Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee against the House\u2019s continuing resolution\u2014a procedural vote that would have prevented debate on the funding and thus blocked Democrats from adding back funding for the law. He voted with most Senate Republicans on the shutdown-ending bill. So conservatives want to replace him. McDaniel\u2019s announcement was echoed by an immediate $1 million ad buy from the Washington, D.C.\u2013based Club for Growth, introducing Mississippians to McDaniel as an antidote to (unnamed) \u201ccareer politicians bankrupting our country.\u201d\n\nAny donor who thought that the shutdown would \u201cbreak the fever\u201d of the Tea Party clearly didn\u2019t know enough conservatives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cI would have stood my ground and fought on the issue of defunding,\u201d McDaniel said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve increased the debt ceiling 77 times since 1962, so when it does happen, let\u2019s attempt to get concessions out of the compromise. This time, the Republicans didn\u2019t pick up any significant or substantive concessions. I\u2019ve been practicing law for years, and every time I had a lawsuit settled, both parties walked away with something. That didn\u2019t happen here\u2014there were no concessions on health care or the debt. I would have stood and fought.\u201d\n\nAny Republican donor who thought that the shutdown would \u201cbreak the fever\u201d of the Tea Party, or that it would prove the pesky base wrong about its strategy, clearly didn\u2019t know enough conservatives. \u201cPeople started paying attention to Obamacare again\u201d because of the shutdown, according to McDaniel. The immediate political legacy of the #StandWithCruz moment is a surge of primary challenges, mostly in states or districts that Democrats won\u2019t even try to win. The goal: replace the graybeard Republicans who \u201ccaved\u201d with Cruz/Lee doppelgangers who won\u2019t.\n\nConservatives have boasted about this goal with all the secrecy and humility of Kanye West explaining his lyrics. In 2011, while he was just a candidate for Senate, Ted Cruz told the New York Times that it would \u201cfundamentally shift the character of the Senate\u201d if \u201cthe five or six strong conservatives elected to the Senate in 2012 became 10 or 12.\u201d This week, after he returned to Texas, Cruz blamed the Republicans who had opposed the defund fight for whatever damage had happened to \u201cthe Republican brand.\u201d\n\nConservative activists want to fix this by removing or replacing anyone who didn\u2019t fight. Nebraska Sen. Mike Johanns is retiring, spending his final months in office chastening the conservatives who wanted to defund Obamacare through the CR. \u201cIt's a tactic that promised things that as a minority we do not have any ability to deliver,\u201d Johanns told the Lincoln Journal-Star. \u201cI don't see an exit strategy.\u201d But the surprise hope to replace Johanns is Ben Sasse, a 42-year-old former Health and Human Services assistant secretary who calls himself \u201cthe anti-Obamacare candidate\u201d and says he\u2019s \u201cnot looking to meet in the middle.\u201d Sasse is already getting Cruz-like treatment in conservative media. The state\u2019s former treasurer, who led early polls, raised $336,000 in the first quarter. Sasse raised $815,000, breaking a record set six years ago by Sen. Johanns. Shortly thereafter he was endorsed by the Senate Conservatives Fund, which previously backed Cruz and Lee.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe typical, Karl Rove knock on Tea Party candidates is that they blow elections for the Republican Party in hard-to-win states. Sasse and McDaniel are seeking nominations in states where Democrats can no longer compete; the last serious Democratic recruits in Nebraska and Mississippi, Bob Kerrey and Ronnie Musgrove, lost by double digits. It\u2019s been 19 years since Democrats seriously contested a Senate race in Kansas, and that minimizes the risk posed by Dr. Milton Wolf, a distant Obama cousin and Tea Party speaker who\u2019s now challenging Sen. Pat Roberts over his vote to put Kathleen Sebelius (the state\u2019s former governor) in charge of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAnd by 2014 it\u2019ll have been a decade since Democrats made a run at a Senate seat in South Carolina. No Democrat, says 43-year-old state Sen. Lee Bright, will win statewide office there as long as Barack Obama is president. That argument is helping his primary challenge to Sen. Lindsey Graham, who voted against the Cruz/Lee stratagem and trashed it whenever a microphone or camera came into view.\n\n\u201cI would have voted with Cruz and Lee,\u201d said Bright. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing they\u2019ve done up to this point that I disagree with. Look, people are going to ask: Where were you? Did you do everything you could to stop this? The Republican minority in the Senate blinked, as Obama knew they would.\u201d\n\nHow could Bright or McDaniel have changed that? Neither of them suggested a play that Cruz hadn\u2019t already tried. Both candidates said they were disinclined to raise the debt limit, and would only do so if conditions were met. Both would have voted against any of the deals that ended the last few showdowns.\n\n\u201cWhen the Democrats proposed Obamacare, a lot of people gave them no chance of succeeding,\u201d said McDaniel. \u201cBut they worked, and they fought. The point is, you fight every day, you get in the trenches, you do the right thing for your republic even if it hurts. In life, sometimes victories don\u2019t come overnight.\u201d\n\nBright was just as optimistic, and hopeful that a few more conservative senators could put the fear into \u201csquishy moderates\u201d the next time Congress was asked to fund the government or raise the debt limit.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Meet three Republicans who want to be just like the junior senator from Texas.", "fb-share": "Meet Three Republicans Who Want to Be Just Like Ted Cruz", "sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "On Oct. 16, as the House and Senate sheepishly reopened the government and raised the debt limit, political reporters opened their email to find an uns ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "On Oct. 16, as the House and Senate sheepishly reopened the government and raised the debt limit, political reporters opened their email to find an uns ...", "title": "Meet Three Republicans Who Want to Be Just Like Ted Cruz", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/ted_cruz_is_a_model_for_rising_republicans_gop_primary_challengers_are_following.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/131023_POL_ChrisMcDaniel.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Oct. 16, as the House and Senate sheepishly reopened the government and raised the debt limit, political reporters opened their email to find an uns ...", "title": "Meet Three Republicans Who Want to Be Just Like Ted Cruz", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/ted_cruz_is_a_model_for_rising_republicans_gop_primary_challengers_are_following.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/131023_POL_ChrisMcDaniel.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@daveweigel", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-23T10:23:13Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Meet Three Republicans Who Want to Be Just Like Ted Cruz", "sailthru.headline": "The Next Ted Cruz", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Meet Three Republicans Who Want to Be Just Like Ted Cruz\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/ted_cruz_is_a_model_for_rising_republicans_gop_primary_challengers_are_following.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/131023_POL_ChrisMcDaniel.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100131023003\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-23T10:23:13Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"David Weigel\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"ted cruz\",\n    \"congress\",\n    \"republicans\",\n    \"politics\",\n    \"obama\",\n    \"tea party\",\n    \"ted cruz\",\n    \"congress\",\n    \"republicans\",\n    \"politics\",\n    \"obama\",\n    \"tea party\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Meet Three Republicans Who Want to Be Just Like Ted Cruz", "keywords": "Ted Cruz, Ted Cruz Obamacare, Tea Party, Ted Cruz Tea Party, Chris McDaniel, Chris McDaniel Cruz, Chris McDaniel Thad Cochran, Ben Sasse, Cruz Ben Sasse, Lee Bright, Cruz Lee Bright, Tea Party primary candidates, Mike Johanns retiring, Lindsey Graham, Lindsey Graham challenger, Lindsey Graham primary, Lindsey Graham Lee Bright, Cruz shutdown, Cruz debt limit, Republicans caved, moderate Senate Republicans", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "Ted Cruz, Ted Cruz Obamacare, Tea Party, Ted Cruz Tea Party, Chris McDaniel, Chris McDaniel Cruz, Chris McDaniel Thad Cochran, Ben Sasse, Cruz Ben Sasse, Lee Bright, Cruz Lee Bright, Tea Party primary candidates, Mike Johanns retiring, Lindsey Graham, Lindsey Graham challenger, Lindsey Graham primary, Lindsey Graham Lee Bright, Cruz shutdown, Cruz debt limit, Republicans caved, moderate Senate Republicans", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate", "author": "http://facebook.com/daveweigel"}, "sailthru.description": "On Oct. 16, as the House and Senate sheepishly reopened the government and raised the debt limit, political reporters opened their email to find an uns ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/10/131023_POL_ChrisMcDaniel.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc4b3\"", "article_summary": "AdvertisementThe typical, Karl Rove knock on Tea Party candidates is that they blow elections for the Republican Party in hard-to-win states.\ncourthouse and confirmed that he would challenge Sen.
