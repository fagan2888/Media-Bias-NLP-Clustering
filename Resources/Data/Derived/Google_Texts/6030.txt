In case one forgot that Saturday was the first day of March, the 2A boys District 7 championship at Mountain View High School provided a pretty good reminder.

This month is of course known for its postseason basketball, and Resurrection Christian and Liberty Common delivered a gem of a game that only seems to come this time of year.

In a thrilling contest that featured everything from a furious rally to a controversial ending, Liberty Common hung on for the tournament title with a 63-60 victory.

The second-seeded Eagles (16-5) earned the hardware and a No. 1 seed at next week's regionals despite having their 15-point second-half lead evaporate in the fourth quarter in an all-out blitz of a comeback by the top-seeded Cougars (18-4).

And it wasn't without some second-guessing, either.

After free throws by Eagles guard Arjun Gill gave his team a three-point lead with 5 seconds left, the Cougars' Brock Buxman dribbled the length of the court the ensuing possession and found teammate Matt Jason open for a potential game-tying 3-pointer.

Jason took a dribble to his right before getting fouled as he went up to hoist his shot. Had the foul been ruled in the act of shooting, Jason would have had the chance to tie the game at the charity stripe. Instead, officials said Jason was fouled before his shot, essentially ending the game as Jason went to the line for a 1-and-1 with just 0.3 seconds left.

"My guy closed out on me, so I pumped faked, drove by and I thought I got the shot off," he said. "But, I guess I didn't."

Liberty Common coach Jim Altergott said the plan was to foul purposely to prevent Rez from even having a chance to tie it, but he would've preferred that his team fouled sooner.

"We fouled them a little late, so it certainly might've looked that way," Altergott said of whether he thought it was a shooting foul. "I'm very pleased it was called the way it was. If it were to have been a shooting foul, it could've been a bad decision on my part."

It was an disheartening end to an otherwise valiant effort for the Cougars and their coach, Bruce Dick.

"Disappointing it ended that way," Rez coach Bruce Dick said. "But Matt had a terrific game."

Jason, a junior transfer from Mountain View playing in his former gym, led all scorers with 26 points. He was 10-for-12 from the field and scored 12 points in the fourth quarter when the Cougars began the frame on a 15-2 run to overcome a 46-34 deficit.

Jason was also good early, scoring 12 points in the first half to prevent his team from getting blown out as they went into the locker room down 32-23.

"I was just getting in the flow early. I hit two 3s in the beginning, and from there on out my offensive game was going," he said.

While the Cougars — who also had Buxman score 13 points and Tanner Ervin nine — appeared the better team late, they fell behind early because of foul trouble.

The Eagles were in the single bonus in the first two minutes of the second quarter, a trend that continued throughout the afternoon as Liberty Common attempted 25 free throws compared to Resurrection Christian's nine

Settling for 3-pointers against the Eagles' zone defense also hurt the Cougars, who were 5-for-19 in the first half from long range.

"We were settling too much and we were not getting second-chances," Dick said. "We never get in foul trouble. We just never do, and we were in foul trouble the first half from the get-go playing the same way we play all year. It happens."

Rez was able to rally in the second half by pressuring the Eagles into turnovers and taking the ball to the basket. Their huge run to start the fourth game them a 49-48 lead midway through the quarter, their first lead since the opening minutes and the first of six straight lead changes.

The Eagles rebounded by taking a four-point lead with 1:25 to play before five straight by Jason put the Cougars up one with less than a minute to play. A layup by Gill then put the Eagles on top for good.

"They battled back, but we dug ourselves too big a hole," Dick said. "We climbed back out of the hole, but they made plays and we didn't."

The Cougars now turn their attention to next week's regionals, where they'll be No. 2 seed. Though they emerged from Saturday's thriller thoroughly disappointed, they can take solace in knowing they battled back and made it to state after losing the district tournament final last year.

"Obviously it's huge motivation," Jason said. " So we've got to play with a chip on our shoulders the next game."

Seeding for 2A regionals will be released Sunday.
