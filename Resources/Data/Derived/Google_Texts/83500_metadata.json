(Jenni Grubbs / Fort Morgan Times)\n\nThe 36 eighth-graders and 43 seventh-graders met the academic and service standards and got recommendations from faculty members before their induction was approved.\n\nAt the ceremony Thursday, Assistant Principal Erik Christensen welcomed everyone and introduced the guest speaker, Re-3 School District Superintendent Ron Echols.\n\nThe superintendent chose to have a couple students, seventh-graders Uriel Rey and Braxton Parks, lighten the mood at the serious event by telling jokes.\n\nRey's joke was about a one-story house that was all pink, both inside and out. He asked the crowd, \"What color were the stairs?\" A mix of groans and laughs filled the auditorium as the audience got it. There are no stairs in a one-story house.\n\nThe mood sufficiently lightened after both boys' jokes, Echols got down to business.\n\n\"We all expect great things from you in the future,\" he told the students getting inducted. \"I certainly do.\"\n\nEchols also said, \"It takes courage to grow up and become the person you really are.\"\n\nHe told the students that they were on the right path for doing that and then quoted President John F. Kennedy: \"Every day, you are growing yourself to become the person you want to be.\"\n\nThe superintendent urged the students to \"be very careful and make sure you're making the right decisions to be who you want to be.\"\n\nAfter Echols spoke, NJHS Chapter Faculty Adviser Sheila Fenderson declared that the students about to be inducted had demonstrated that they had the personal qualities of the honor society: scholarship, leadership, service, citizenship and character.\n\nThe organization then installed the new NJHS officers: President Savannah Reagan, Vice President Nancy Serrano, Secretary Autumn Wheatley and Treasurer Cole Givens.\n\nThe five candles representing the qualities of NJHS members then were lit, with faculty members Carolyn Klimper and Cynthia Christensen lighting the one for scholarship and describing it and then the officers lighting candles and describing the other four qualities.\n\nAfter that, all of the students recited the NJHS Pledge: \"I pledge myself to uphold the high purposes of the National Junior Honor Society to which I have been selected; I will be true to the principles for which it stands; I will be loyal to my school; and will maintain and encourage high standards of scholarship, service, leadership, citizenship and character.\"\n\nThe students then walked one at a time across the front of the stage, shaking hands with Echols, the new officers and faculty and receiving their NJHS membership pins.\n\nThat was followed by lots of picture-taking and congratulatory hugs with loved ones, as well as a reception with punch and cookies in the cafeteria to celebrate the students' achievement.\n\nJenni Grubbs: jgrubbs@fmtimes.com, Twitter @JenniGrubbs or tout.com/jennigrubbs", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url":
