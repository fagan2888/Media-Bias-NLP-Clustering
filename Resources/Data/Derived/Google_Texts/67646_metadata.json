Sanders in opposing the North American Free Trade Agreement and permanent normal trade relations with China,\u201d said Warren Gunnels , Sanders\u2019 policy director, in a press release.\n\nThe campaign noted that Sanders strongly opposed President Obama's push for trade promotion authority that will allow trade deals to move through Congress on an up-or-down vote without the chance for lawmakers to offer amendments.\n\n\u201cBernie has always understood that fast-tracking these disastrous trade deals would pave the way for more lost jobs, more lost factories and more pain for the middle class,\" Gunnels said.\n\nIf elected president, the Sanders campaign said he would set a high standard for trade deals, vowing to block any agreement that would send U.S. jobs overseas, push up prescription drug prices, overturn U.S. financial laws, or include countries like Malaysia, Vietnam or Brunei over the treatment of workers and various human rights issues.\n\n\u201cWe challenge Secretary Clinton to make those same commitments,\u201d Gunnels said. \u201cOur goal must be to make sure that American-made products, not American jobs, are our number one export.\u201d\n\nShortly after the TPP was completed in early October, Clinton publicly opposed the TPP deal after advocating for the agreement while she was secretary of State.\n\nEarlier this week, Clinton outlined her plans for expanding trade, arguing that raising standards for global agreements is the only way to ensure that the United States sees the benefits.\n\n\u201cWe have to set a high bar for any new trade agreements, and only support them if they will create good jobs, raise wages and advance our national security,\u201d she wrote in an op-ed in Maine\u2019s Portland Press Herald.\n\nClinton said she opposed the TPP \u201cwhen it failed to meet those tests, and would oppose future agreements if they failed to meet that bar.\u201d\n\nLast week, Rep. Sander Levin (D-Mich.), who announced he is opposing TPP as negotiated, said he would trust Clinton to make changes if she wins the White House.\n\n\u201cI would have confidence in how she would address these trade issues,\u201d he said.\n\nPresident Obama and his Cabinet are calling for Congress to pass the TPP this year before he leaves office.\n\nCongressional leaders have said that the trade agreement won\u2019t likely be considered until after the November elections.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sen.
