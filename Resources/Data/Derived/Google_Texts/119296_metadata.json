This reached an all-time high of $3 trillion, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nThe news comes amid new efforts to defund Obamacare. On Friday, the Senate voted to repeal the health care reform, a measure that is certain to be vetoed.\n\nThough largely a symbolic gesture, the vote sets the stage for a 2016 election when Barack Obama\u2019s signature program is assured to come under fire from Republicans.\n\nIt also showed that Obamacare could eventually be repealed.\n\n\u201cIt demonstrates that if you have a president prepared to support health care reform, it could pass next time,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican (via CNN). \u201cIf this vote occurred after the next presidential election, instead of vetoing it the President would sign it. This would force a bipartisan reevaluation of health care in America and put us in a position to make major changes.\u201d\n\nThe Senate finally voted to repeal Obamacare https://t.co/3HeJgYY2C0 pic.twitter.com/qECG9XNO74 \u2014 The Atlantic (@TheAtlantic) December 4, 2015\n\nRepublicans were able to pass the reform by using a measure known as \u201cbudget reconciliation\u201d that allowed Republicans to push it through with just 51 votes rather than the 60 normally needed for such a significant bill.\n\nIt\u2019s up to the House to pass the Senate bill, and ensure #Obamacare repeal makes it to @BarackObama\u2018s desk pic.twitter.com/U3g5ZM474o \u2014 Tea Party Patriots (@TPPatriots) December 4, 2015\n\nWhile a past series of votes had been empty measures, Republicans now appear closer to offering a real alternative to Obamacare. House Speaker Paul Ryan delivered his vision for the future, saying that in the next year Republicans plan to unveil a plan to \u201creplace every word of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nBut MSNBC\u2018s Steve Bennen noted that Republicans have been promising their own plan since 2009, when Obamacare was first passed. Bennen said it has even become a running joke in Democratic circles that Republicans are often vowing to release their own version of comprehensive health care reform, but have yet to do so.\n\nThat could likely change in the coming months as the Republican and Democratic primaries wind down and the next general election nears, with Republicans seeing their first real opportunity to promote a plan that cannot be vetoed by Obama.\n\nBut amid the criticisms, Obamacare has brought successes as well. As the CMS report noted, it led to four years of lower-than-average growth before this year, and much of the growth this year came through an influx of close to 17 million people who were previously not insured.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act has greatly expanded health insurance coverage, but it has caused little change in the way most previously covered Americans are getting health insurance coverage,\u201d said Katherine Carman, an economist at RAND who led the study team, after a report released in May.\n\n\u201cThe law has expanded coverage to more Americans using all parts of the health insurance system.\u201d\n\nMany different groups have declared Obamacare to be a success. Jared Bernstein, a former chief economist to Vice President Biden, is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, wrote that Obamacare has achieved its primary goal of reducing the number of uninsured.\n\nThese successes could also make Obamacare more difficult to repeal \u2014 unless those also include a plan to keep those newly covered from losing what insurance they now have.\n\n[Photo by AP Photo/Scott Sonner]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare helped push U.S. healthcare spending to an all-time high, but amid criticism and plans to dismantle the comprehensive health insurance reform, the", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Obamacare helped push U.S. healthcare spending to an all-time high, but amid criticism and plans to dismantle the comprehensive health insurance reform, the", "title": "Is Obamacare Working?
