Requiring that, the court said, doesn\u2019t \u201csubstantially burden\u201d the Catholic organization\u2019s free exercise of religion.\n\nThe appeals court, however, put a hold on its ruling until the Supreme Court addresses the same issue through similar cases expected to be heard this year.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, most health insurance plans are required to cover contraceptives without cost sharing.\n\nEWTN, founded by a cloistered nun named Mother Angelica, describes itself as \u201cdedicated to the advancement of truth as defined by the magisterium of the Roman Catholic Church\u201d\u2014which considers the use of contraception morally wrong.\n\nThe court\u2019s majority opinion\u2014from Judge Jill Pryor, appointed by President Barack Obama, and Judge R. Lanier Anderson, appointed by President Jimmy Carter\u2014reads:\n\nWe accept that the plaintiffs truly believe that triggering contraceptive coverage or being complicit in a system providing contraceptive coverage violates their religious beliefs. But our objective inquiry leads us to conclude that the government has not put plaintiffs to the choice of violating their religious beliefs or facing a significant penalty.\n\nThe two judges found that federal regulation mandating the contraception coverage doesn\u2019t violate the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which prohibits \u201csubstantially burdening a person\u2019s exercise of religion\u201d except through the use of the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d of furthering a \u201ccompelling governmental interest.\u201d\n\nThe two judges asserted that requiring \u201cfree\u201d contraceptives for EWTN employees reflects the government\u2019s interest in \u201cavoiding the adverse public health consequences of unintended pregnancies and in assuring women the equal benefit of preventative care.\u201d\n\nAn amicus curiae brief submitted by EWTN in support of the petitioners in the upcoming Supreme Court case Zubik v. Burwell reads in part:\n\nEver since it was issued in 2011, EWTN has vigorously contested the federal mandate \u2026 requiring its self-insured health plan to cover contraception, sterilization, and abortion-inducing drugs.\n\nIn his dissenting opinion, Judge Gerald Bard Tjoflat, appointed by President Gerald Ford, wrote that his colleagues\u2019 understanding of the \u201csubstantial burden test\u201d of the federal law known as RFRA leads to a situation in which \u201cfederal judges would have to decide whether the burden itself substantially violated the adherent\u2019s beliefs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe majority runs roughshod over the sincerely held religious objections of Eternal Word Television Network,\u201d Tjoflat wrote, concluding that \u201cthe majority\u2019s reasoning takes aim at the heart of RFRA itself.\u201d He added:\n\nThe Constitution does not vest in the judiciary the authority to declare winners and losers in matters of faith. And for good reason.\n\nDaniel Blomberg, legal counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents EWTN, told The Daily Signal that the nonprofit Christian legal organization is considering the next course of action for its client.\n\nBlomberg called the majority decision a \u201cremarkable and dangerous\u201d threat to religious liberty for people of all faiths. He said that although the U.S. government does not require its own military to comply with the contraceptive mandate, it is \u201cinsisting on making EWTN participate in handing out the drugs in violation of their faith.\u201d\n\nThe two judges in the majority did not consider direct government funding of contraceptives as a viable option, arguing that \u201cadopting a single-payer system for contraception would require Congress to squeeze insurance companies out of an entire segment of the health insurance business.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s crazy, that\u2019s wrong to say that an insurance company\u2019s bottom line is more important than EWTN\u2019s religious belief,\u201d Blomberg said.\n\nBlomberg questioned the majority\u2019s opinion that federal regulation exempts \u201chouses of worship\u201d from the contraceptive mandate for employees but not religiously affiliated organizations.\n\nThe two judges said the rationale behind the Obamacare regulation is based on a \u201ccommonsense notion\u201d that church employees are more likely to share the same beliefs as their employer.\n\nThe regulation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services states:\n\nHouses of worship and their integrated auxiliaries that object to contraceptive coverage on religious grounds are more likely than other employers to employ people of the same faith who share the same objection, and who would therefore be less likely than other people to use contraceptive services even if such services were covered under their plan.\n\nBlomberg said EWTN offers daily Mass, and a monastery serves employees at the network\u2019s Alabama headquarters.\n\n\u201cBasically, what you have here is a situation where federal bureaucrats are making uneducated guesses about the religious devotion of employees,\u201d Blomberg said, adding:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The appeals court put a hold on its ruling until the Supreme Court addresses the same issue in similar cases, expected to be heard this year.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The appeals court put a hold on its ruling until the Supreme Court addresses the same issue in similar cases, expected to be heard this year.", "title": "Judges: Catholic Net Must Cover Employees' Contraceptives", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160219_EWTN_Barillas.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-23T12:49:20+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1PSyrlO"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The appeals court put a hold on its ruling until the Supreme Court addresses the same issue in similar cases, expected to be heard this year.", "title": "Judges: Catholic Net Must Cover Employees' Contraceptives", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160219_EWTN_Barillas.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "religious freedom", "published_time": "2016-02-22T23:11:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-23T12:49:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "religious freedom, ewtn, catholic abortion, obamacare mandate, contraception mandate, supreme court, Eternal Word Television Network, Affordable Care Act"}, "article_summary": "Circuit Court of Appeals decided Thursday that the U.S. government has \u201ca compelling interest\u201d to ensure that EWTN employees are enrolled in a health plan that provides contraceptives.\nA federal appeals court has ruled that Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN), a global Catholic TV channel, must cover contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs in employee health plans, as mandated by Obamacare.\nBlomberg questioned the majority\u2019s opinion that federal regulation exempts \u201chouses of worship\u201d from the contraceptive mandate for employees but not religiously affiliated organizations.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, most health insurance plans are required to cover contraceptives without cost sharing.\n\u201cBasically, what you have here is a situation where federal bureaucrats are making uneducated guesses about the religious devotion of employees,\u201d Blomberg said, adding:"}
