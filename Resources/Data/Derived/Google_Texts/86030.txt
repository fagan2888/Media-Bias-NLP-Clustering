Guilford police have arrested a 56-year-old Norwalk man who is accused of attempting to entice a 14-year-old girl into “sexual situations” over Craigslist and sending her lewd photos of himself.

During the arrest, police recovered the cell phone they said Cardamone used when he sent the 14-year-old girls the lewd photos, communicated with her and asked for photos back.

Cardamone is being held on a court set $200,000 bond and will be arraigned in New Haven Superior Court on Thursday.
