And then the San Francisco Giants threw their weight around, signing Jeff Samardzija to a five-year deal for $90 million, pending a physical.\n\nThe annual winter meetings officially begin Monday, and the Rockies figure to be minor players. They enter the fray, once again, as the most pitching-deprived team in the NL West, if not the majors. With the monetary bar already set sky high, it will be more difficult than ever for Colorado to beef up its rotation via free agency.\n\nOf course, general manager Jeff Bridich is more apt to pull the trigger on a trade in an effort to upgrade pitching. Going the trade route could cost the Rockies an outfielder and probably a prospect or two.\n\nFormer all-stars Carlos Gonzalez and Charlie Blackmon, plus up-and-coming slugger Corey Dickerson, could have suitors. But it\u2019s clear the Rockies will have to give up something big to get quality on the mound.\n\nThese will be Bridich\u2019s second winter meetings as the Rockies\u2019 chief architect, and he remains as tight-lipped as ever about Colorado\u2019s plan. Then again, he shocked the baseball world in late July by trading star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and reliever LaTroy Hawkins to Toronto for veteran shortstop Jose Reyes and three right-handed pitching prospects.\n\n\u201cThe primary difference (this year) is that the composition of our team is different now, so that forces you to be flexible for any opportunities that are out there,\u201d Bridich said. \u201cBut our overall approach will be the same.\u201d\n\nPitchers such as Chicago White Sox lefty Jose Quintana and Cleveland Indians righty Carlos Carrasco could emerge as targets. So could Atlanta Braves righty Shelby Miller, a hot commodity. As of last week, however, the Rockies had not been in contact with the Braves regarding Miller.\n\nColorado, which lost closer John Axford and is waiting for Adam Ottavino to return from Tommy John surgery last spring, also needs help in the bullpen.\n\nColorado also could make a move to upgrade first base. They had preliminary talks with the Seattle Mariners about first baseman Mark Trumbo, but he was subsequently dealt to the Baltimore Orioles. For now, steady and improving Ben Paulsen is the starter at first. Still, the interest in Trumbo shows that the Rockies would like to add a power bat to their lineup.\n\nThe Rule 5 draft comes Thursday at the tail end of the winter meetings, and it could be important for the Rockies, who are trying to build a collection of young, powerful pitchers. They choose fourth, and there are prospects to be had. Righties Corey Black (Chicago Cubs), Zack Jones (Minnesota Twins) and Alberto Tirado (Philadelphia Phillies), and lefties Onelki Garcia (White Sox), Reymin Guduan (Houston Astros) and Sam Selman (Kansas City Royals) all fit the bill.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or @psaundersdp\n\nRockies at winter meetings\n\n\u2022 Possible (but unlikely) free-agent targets: Right-handed pitchers Ian Kennedy, Doug Fister and Mike Leake, and first baseman Chris Davis.\n\n\u2022 Possible trade targets: White Sox LHP Jose Quintana, Indians RHP Carlos Carrasco and Braves RHP Shelby Miller.\n\n\u2022 Possible trade bait: Outfielders Carlos Gonzalez, Corey Dickerson and Charlie Blackmon, as well as prospects.\n\n\u2022 Rockies\u2019 needs: Starting pitching, relief pitching, power bat.\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Pitching won\u2019t be easy for Colorado Rockies to acquire", "title": "Pitching won\u2019t be easy for Colorado Rockies to acquire", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/06/pitching-wont-be-easy-for-colorado-rockies-to-acquire/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151206__jeff-bridichp1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151206__jeff-bridichp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-06T18:22:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:57:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u2022 Possible trade targets: White Sox LHP Jose Quintana, Indians RHP Carlos Carrasco and Braves RHP Shelby Miller.\nThe annual winter meetings officially begin Monday, and the Rockies figure to be minor players.\nThese will be Bridich\u2019s second winter meetings as the Rockies\u2019 chief architect, and he remains as tight-lipped as ever about Colorado\u2019s plan.\n\u2022 Rockies\u2019 needs: Starting pitching, relief pitching, power bat.\n\u2022 Possible trade bait: Outfielders Carlos Gonzalez, Corey Dickerson and Charlie Blackmon, as well as prospects."}
