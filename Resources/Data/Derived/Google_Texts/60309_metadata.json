I know this place hasn\u2019t been (to a bowl) in a while.\u201d\n\nCSU (7-6, 5-2 Mountain West) will face Washington State (6-6, 4-5 Pac-12) in Albuquerque, with kickoff at noon. The bowl is the Rams\u2019 first since 2008, when it defeated Fresno State 40-35 in the New Mexico Bowl.\n\nThere were six bowl slots for seven bowl-eligible Mountain West teams. San Jose State was left out.\n\n\u201cThis is a big moment for our program; we were all really excited and everybody was cheering,\u201d CSU senior linebacker Shaquil Barrett said of McElwain\u2019s announcement. \u201cI like playing a team from a big conference.\u201d\n\nMcElwain said the benefits of playing in a bowl game are far-reaching, including the national exposure which can give a bump to recruiting and fundraising, and the additional practices which provide a head start for 2014.\n\n\u201cThis just puts you in that \u2018club\u2019 (of bowl teams),\u201d McElwain said. \u201cThere are certain teams in the club and certain teams that are not in the club. This gives us an opportunity to show the good things that are happening at Colorado State.\u201d\n\nCSU plans to do most of its practicing in Fort Collins. The team will depart for Albuquerque on Dec. 18.\n\nNobody on the Colorado State roster has played in a bowl game.\n\n\u201cAs a senior class, that\u2019s the mark we wanted to leave \u2014 starting CSU on the right track and getting to a bowl game,\u201d said center Weston Richburg, a four-year starter.\n\nMcElwain said CSU is just getting started.\n\n\u201cThis (bowl invitation) speaks volumes about how far we\u2019ve come,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ll get used to.\u201d Tom Kensler: tkensler@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tomkensler\n\nEye on\u2026 The Cougars\n\nCSU beat reporter Tom Kensler takes an early look at Washington State:\n\nRecord: 6-6, 4-5 Pac-12 (tied for fourth in North Division)\n\nCoach: Mike Leach is in his second season at Washington State and, like CSU\u2019s Jim McElwain, his team improved by three victories from 2013. Fans along the Front Range may remember Leach\u2019s 10 seasons at Texas Tech, when he guided the Red Raiders to a bowl game each year and won 84 games.\n\nBest victory: The Cougars won 10-7 at Southern California on Sept. 7 in their Pac-12 opener. That immediately put then-Trojans coach Lane Kiffin on the hot seat. Washington State also won conference road games at California and at Arizona.\n\nBest defeat: As it turned out, it was the season-opening 31-24 loss at Auburn, which will face Florida State for the BCS championship. Auburn managed just two field goals after halftime and had a 100-yard kickoff return in the second quarter. WSU outgained Auburn 464-394, in total yards.\n\nBest player: Operating out of Leach\u2019s signature spread offense, junior quarterback Connor Halliday ranks fourth nationally in passing yards (4,189) and is tied for 13th with 28 touchdown passes.\n\nSeries history: Surprisingly, this will be the first meeting between Colorado State and Washington State.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU Rams to face Washington State in New Mexico Bowl on Dec. 21", "title": "CSU Rams to face Washington State in New Mexico Bowl on Dec. 21", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/08/csu-rams-to-face-washington-state-in-new-mexico-bowl-on-dec-21/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131128_072407_colorado-state-rams-3.jpg", "height": 558}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131128_072407_colorado-state-rams-3.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-08T14:23:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T08:38:33+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce48f\"", "article_summary": "Series history: Surprisingly, this will be the first meeting between Colorado State and Washington State.\n\u201cThis just puts you in that \u2018club\u2019 (of bowl teams),\u201d McElwain said.\nThe bowl is the Rams\u2019 first since 2008, when it defeated Fresno State 40-35 in the New Mexico Bowl.\nFORT COLLINS \u2014 During Jim McElwain\u2019s nearly three-decade journey as a college football assistant, he coached in nine bowl games, including a pair of BCS championship games at Alabama.\nI know this place hasn\u2019t been (to a bowl) in a while.\u201dCSU (7-6, 5-2 Mountain West) will face Washington State (6-6, 4-5 Pac-12) in Albuquerque, with kickoff at noon."}
