The plaintiffs alleged that Guitar Center and five large guitar manufacturers orchestrated the unlawful price-fixing agreements during meetings sponsored by the National Association of Music Merchants Inc. (NAMM), the main trade association for the musical instrument industry. A divided Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal, agreeing with the lower court that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim.\n\nThe suit followed a 2007 Federal Trade Commission investigation into price-fixing in the musical instrument industry. The FTC alleged that NAMM organized meetings and programs at which competing retailers of musical instruments were \u201cpermitted and encouraged\u201d to discuss setting minimum prices. Critically, the FTC alleged that these information exchanges facilitated by the trade association \u201cserved no legitimate business purpose\u201d and \u201chad the purpose, tendency, and capacity to facilitate collusion.\u201d Without admitting fault, NAMM settled with the FTC via consent decree in 2009.\n\nBuilding upon the foundation laid by the FTC, plaintiffs here claimed that the defendants reached their illicit agreements while attending these NAMM meetings. The Ninth Circuit rejected that argument, however, finding plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of \u201cplus factors\u201d to be \u201cno more consistent with an illegal agreement than with rational and competitive business strategies, independently adopted by firms acting within an interdependent market.\u201d Because mere parallel conduct cannot form the basis of an antitrust claim, the court held that the dismissal was required.\n\nWhile NAMM members were able to avoid liability here, their victory followed years of costly court battles. The case illustrates the costs and dangers of price-related discussions with competitors, especially at trade association meetings, and why such discussions should be avoided.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On August 25, 2015, the Ninth Circuit upheld a federal district court\u2019s dismissal of a consolidated class action accusing guitar retail giant Guitar Center, and several large guitar manufacturers, of conspiring to set minimum guitar and amplifier prices.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "On August 25, 2015, the Ninth Circuit upheld a federal district court&amp;rsquo;s dismissal of a consolidated class action accusing guitar retail giant Guitar Center (and several large guitar manufacturer", "title": "Guitar Center: Off the Hook but at a Price", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/guitar-center-hook-price", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1123/Guitar.%20close-up.jpg?itok=ivob8L-x", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Ninth Circuit, Class Action, Guitar Center, price fixing, amplifier, retail", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, Litigation, Ninth Circuit, Class Action, Guitar Center, price fixing, amplifier, retail"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd298d\"", "article_summary": "Saturday, September 5, 2015On August 25, 2015, the Ninth Circuit upheld a federal district court\u2019s dismissal of a consolidated class action accusing guitar retail giant Guitar Center (and several large guitar manufacturers) of conspiring to set minimum guitar and amplifier prices.\nThe case illustrates the costs and dangers of price-related discussions with competitors, especially at trade association meetings, and why such discussions should be avoided.\nThe plaintiffs alleged that Guitar Center and five large guitar manufacturers orchestrated the unlawful price-fixing agreements during meetings sponsored by the National Association of Music Merchants Inc.
