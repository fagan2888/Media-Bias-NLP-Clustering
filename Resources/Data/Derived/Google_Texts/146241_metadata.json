Do not believe the smugglers. Do not risk your lives and your money. It is all for nothing,\" Tusk said.\n\nUp to 30,000 refugees and migrants have been stranded in Greece from progressive border closures further up the \"Balkan corridor\", the route taken to get into wealthier central and northern Europe.\n\n\"At Monday's summit, Greece will demand that burden sharing be equitable among all countries in the bloc, and sanctions for those that do not,\" Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said after meeting Tusk.\n\n\"We ask that unilateral actions stop in Europe,\" Tsipras said in a view echoed by Tusk.\n\nAustria and countries along the Balkans migration route have imposed restrictions on their borders, limiting the numbers able to cross. Many of the migrants hope to reach Germany. Macedonian police fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of migrants who stormed the border from Greece on Monday.\n\nEMERGENCY CONTROLS\n\nThe European Commission will present on Friday a list of necessary steps to lift emergency border controls that are currently in place inside the Schengen zone and restore the proper functioning of the free-travel area, officials said.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told a lecture in the Hague on Thursday that Austria had been wrong to close its border with another Schengen country.\n\n\"That has nothing to do with protection of external borders. Restoring borders between two Schengen countries will destroy the common market,\" he said.\n\nEU officials have told Reuters that European governments, and particularly Germany, are looking to Turkey to reduce the number of migrant arrivals in Greece to below 1,000 a day at most as an initial condition for discussing taking some Syrian refugees directly from Turkey.\n\nAhead of Monday's meeting of EU and Turkish leaders, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Turkey must ensure the numbers drop towards zero.\n\n\"If there were to be a target figure, it would be zero,\" one EU official said, noting that 1,000 people a day would mean an unsustainable 350,000 people a year arriving in Greece.\n\nTsipras said Greece would continue to do whatever it could to ensure no migrant or refugee was left helpless. But he added Greece could not bear the burden by itself.\n\n\"We will not allow Greece or any other country to be turned into a warehouse of souls,\" Tsipras said. \"We are at a crucial moment for the future of Europe.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Ercan Gurses in Ankara; Editing by Nick Tattersall and Andrew Heavens)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "ANKARA/ATHENS (Reuters) - EU Council President Donald Tusk told illegal economic migra", "title": "EU's Tusk urges migrants to stop coming to Europe", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/03/EUs-Tusk-urges-migrants-stop-coming-Europe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-migrants_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/03/EUs-Tusk-urges-migrants-stop-coming-Europe", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/europe-migrants_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "ANKARA/ATHENS (Reuters) - EU Council President Donald Tusk told illegal economic migra", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"We ask that unilateral actions stop in Europe,\" Tsipras said in a view echoed by Tusk.\n\"I want to appeal to all potential illegal economic migrants wherever you are from: Do not come to Europe.\nSpeaking earlier in Greece, which has been a primary gateway of migrants flooding into Europe for more than a year, Tusk said anyone who was not a refugee should stay away.\nAhead of Monday's meeting of EU and Turkish leaders, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Turkey must ensure the numbers drop towards zero.\nTsipras said Greece would continue to do whatever it could to ensure no migrant or refugee was left helpless."}
