Joann Ginal, D-Fort Collins, the \u201cDrug Production Costs Transparency Requirements\u201d Act would require manufacturers of drugs priced at $50,000 or more per course of treatment or per year to file a report with the Colorado Commission on Affordable Health Care detailing all the costs associated with the production of that drug.\n\n\u201cNever before have pharmaceutical products put such a profound strain on family incomes, employer balance sheets and government budgets,\u201d Ginal wrote in a Feb. 12 guest commentary in the Denver Post. \u201cSpending on prescription drugs grew 13 percent in 2014, double that of any other part of the healthcare system.\u201d\n\nBefore being elected to the State Legislature in 2012, Ginal worked in the pharmaceutical industry for more than 20 years. She cites a recent Consumer Reports survey that found 33 percent of Americans in the past year paid an average of $39 more out of pocket for regular prescriptions for conditions ranging from asthma to high blood pressure to diabetes.\n\n\u201cHouse Bill 1102 imposes no price-control mechanisms and no penalties,\u201d Ginal wrote. \u201cBut it will allow policymakers and the public to have a better understanding of pharmaceutical companies\u2019 costs and profit margins. It is a small step toward providing transparency \u2026\u201d\n\nLocal elected officials are on board as well. The Eagle County commissioners last month passed a resolution supporting the bill, stating \u201chealthcare costs continue to increase at an alarmingly high rate in Eagle County. These increases threaten healthcare access, affordability and the economic vitality of the community.\u201d\n\nAs one of the largest local employers, Eagle County has seen its healthcare costs skyrocket in the last two years to nearly $10 million of its overall $100 million budget for all county services. The county also cited a 2015 Kaiser Health Foundation study that found prescription drugs now represent 19 percent of healthcare spending for Medicaid and employer-sponsored insurance plans.\n\n\u201cThis bill is not about regulation, but rather common-sense transparency aimed at providing information to help maintain an accessible and sustainable healthcare system for all Coloradans,\u201d the commissioners concluded.\n\nAccording to House Democrats, the bill has the support of a diverse group of stakeholders, including the National Federation of Independent Business and the Service Employees International Union. It also has support in the Senate, where Durango Republican Ellen Roberts is a sponsor. Roberts has made lowering healthcare costs on the state\u2019s Western Slope a top priority this session.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working on healthcare cost containment because both from what I\u2019ve seen at the Capitol and what I hear from my constituents that\u2019s the straw that\u2019s breaking the camel\u2019s back for people,\u201d said Roberts, a lawyer who worked as a lift operator and a park ranger for as little as $5.50 an hour when she first moved to the state in 1981. Because of the spiraling costs of healthcare, she said it\u2019s more difficult for young people like her two twenty-something children to live here.\n\n\u201cIf we let the cost of daily life get so high that nobody but the rich can live here, what kind of Colorado do we have?\u201d Roberts said in a previous interview. \u201cThat is the question that I think every legislator and the governor should be asking themselves, and healthcare is the posterchild issue that we should focus on because right now it\u2019s the big gorilla in the room.\u201d\n\nRoberts in part blames the Affordable Care Act \u2013 a common thread with many Colorado Republicans, including Rep. J. Paul Brown, R-Ignacio.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy that on the Western Slope we\u2019re looking at 27 percent increases in our health insurance costs and statewide it\u2019s just like 7 percent, which is too much in itself,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBut the Affordable Care Act was supposed to take care of all of this and we weren\u2019t supposed to have increased costs, and that\u2019s just not the case.\u201d\n\nStill, Brown isn\u2019t sure how he\u2019ll vote during Thursday\u2019s hearing before the Health, Insurance and Environment Committee, which he serves on.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re asking in the bill is for the drug companies to open up their books and show why they have to get that amount for certain drugs, and the problem I guess \u2013 I\u2019m kind of betwixt and between \u2013 because I don\u2019t want government to be involved in everyone\u2019s business,\u201d Brown said.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m going to have to take a hard look at that. I know the Republican caucus is not liking that bill much just because of that, but I\u2019ll tell you what, we\u2019re at least looking at the increased costs [of prescription drugs] and that\u2019s part of our increased healthcare costs.\u201d\n\nGinal and a group of key supporters of the bill are holding a press conference at the Capitol at noon.
