She popped up at her father Kim Jong Il\u2019s December 2011 funeral, then reappeared next to her brother on election day in March of this year. (Yes, North Korea has elections, of sorts.) Experts speculated that her presence at a high-profile political event signaled that she was on the rise within the regime but, as with many things in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK), as it is officially called, the theory was just that \u2014 until now.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, Nov. 26, in an otherwise humdrum account of Kim Jong Un\u2019s visit to a cartoon studio, state media listed Kim Yo Jong as \u201cvice department director\u201d in the powerful Central Committee of the ruling Worker\u2019s Party. In March, when she was pictured beside her brother on polling day, she was identified only as a \u201csenior official.\u201d Though the precise role of a \u201cvice department director\u201d is unclear, that she has an official title suggests a relatively high-profile, and potentially important, role.\n\nSo who is Kim Yo Jong? Korea scholars believe she was born in 1987 or 1988, making her 26 or 27 years old, and that she is close to her brother, Kim Jong Un. Their father, former dictator Kim Jong Il, fathered at least seven children by four women, but Kim Jong Un and Kim Yo Jong have the same parentage. They were raised by their mother Ko Young Hui at a hillside estate, says Michael Madden, the founder of North Korea Leadership Watch. Largely restricted to the palace grounds, they were exposed, for the most part, to family members and close friends. \u201cAs they say in [Martin Scorsese\u2019s mafia epic] Goodfellas, \u2018There were never any outsiders,\u2019\u201d says Madden. \u201cThe life of Kim children was hermetically sealed.\u201d\n\nAt some point in the mid-1990s, as North Korea starved, Kim Jong Un and his sister Kim Yo Jong were sent to to school in Switzerland. They studied under pseudonyms, presumably to protect their privacy and keep them safe. Remarkably little is known about their time there, Madden says. Upon returning to the DPRK, Kim Yo Jong likely attended university, although the details of that period are still fuzzy. Her stature within the clan started to crystallize at Kim Jong Il\u2019s funeral, when she was spotted walking directly behind heir-apparent Kim Jong Un.\n\nAnalysts are still piecing together what, exactly, Kim Yo Jong does. She has been pictured several times in her brother\u2019s company, often on \u201cfield guidance tours\u201d (that\u2019s DPRK-speak for the Kim clan looking at things). These appearances have fueled theories that she serves as a sort of events director and aide to her brother, managing his schedule and accompanying him on trips. If that is indeed her role \u2014 and again, these things are difficult to pinpoint \u2014 it suggests a level of closeness that would give her access to a lot of information. \u201cShe may be one of the only people Kim Jong Un trusts completely,\u201d Madden says.\n\nHer presence at Kim Jong Un\u2019s side is rich with symbolism. Her first official public appearance, in March 2014, came not long after the disappearance of her aunt Kim Kyong Hui, who has not been seen since her husband Jang Sung Thaek was executed in late 2013. Before the purge, Kim Kyong Hui was a close adviser to Kim Jong Il, holding key jobs in the ruling party and \u201cprotecting her brother\u2019s flank,\u201d according to Ken Gause, a Korea expert at CNA Corp., a Washington, D.C.\u2013based research firm. Kim Il Sung, the country\u2019s revered founding father, also ruled with a sibling \u2014 his brother \u2014 at his side (until he demoted him).\n\nThis new sibling pairing provides an important sense of continuity. Though North Korea is often called a communist state, it is really more of a totalitarian monarchy. North Koreans are taught that Kim Il Sung was a fearsome warrior who, while camped at the base of Mount Paektu with some comrades, crushed a much larger force of Japanese invaders. His son and heir, Kim Jong Il, is said to have been born at the same site, imbued with the same superhuman abilities \u2014 heck, he officially shot 11 holes in one in his first-ever game of golf.\n\nSince the deification of the Kim clan is what makes North Korea tick, providing a symbolic link to the past makes sense, even while power passes to the next generation. \u201cThe old power elites loyal to Kim Jong Il are being pushed out,\u201d said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at Seoul\u2019s University of North Korean Studies, in an interview earlier this year. \u201cThey will be replaced by new, younger elites who can safeguard the leadership of Kim Jong Un.\u201d So goodbye, Kim Kyong Hui, and hello, Kim Yo Jong.\n\nVote Now: Who Should Be TIME\u2019s Person of the Year?", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Thursday, Nov. 26, in an account of Kim Jong Un's visit to a cartoon studio, state media listed Kim Yo Jong as \"vice department director\"", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "But who is Kim Jong Un's little sister?", "title": "Another Kim to Worry About", "url": "http://time.com/3608570/north-korea-kim-jong-un-kim-yo-jong/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/rtr4fn4w.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/rtr4fn4w.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "But who is Kim Jong Un's little sister?", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Another Kim to Worry About"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "north korea, kim jong un, kim yo jong, kim jong il, human rights, hermit nation, tyranny, east asia,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "North Korea, Kim Jong Un, Kim Yo Jong, Kim Jong Il, human rights, Hermit Nation, tyranny, East Asia,"}, "article_summary": "Their father, former dictator Kim Jong Il, fathered at least seven children by four women, but Kim Jong Un and Kim Yo Jong have the same parentage.\nAt last, a North Korea rumor proves true: all year, Korea watchers have been buzzing about the rise of Kim Jong Un\u2019s little sister, Kim Yo Jong.\nHer stature within the clan started to crystallize at Kim Jong Il\u2019s funeral, when she was spotted walking directly behind heir-apparent Kim Jong Un.\n\u201cThey will be replaced by new, younger elites who can safeguard the leadership of Kim Jong Un.\u201d So goodbye, Kim Kyong Hui, and hello, Kim Yo Jong.\n\u201cThe life of Kim children was hermetically sealed.\u201dAt some point in the mid-1990s, as North Korea starved, Kim Jong Un and his sister Kim Yo Jong were sent to to school in Switzerland."}
