Ennis Marlise Mu\u00f1oz's husband, Erick\n\nThe lawyers representing Marlise Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s family members, who are suing the Texas hospital that refuses to remove the brain dead woman from life support, have released a statement confirming that Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s fetus is \u201cdistinctly abnormal.\u201d\n\nDespite the fact that Mu\u00f1oz is clinically brain dead, and therefore considered to be deceased under Texas law, hospital officials have been keeping her body on life support because she was 14 weeks pregnant when she lost consciousness. The hospital is citing an obscure Texas law that forbids the state from removing \u201clife-sustaining treatment\u201d from a pregnant woman. Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s family, on the other hand, says that law doesn\u2019t apply in this case because Mu\u00f1oz is already dead.\n\nMu\u00f1oz\u2019s family has repeatedly pointed out that the fetus may have suffered severe abnormalities as a result of Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s brain death. Until this point, however, its health status hasn\u2019t been clear. Now that the pregnancy is a little over 22 weeks along, the Mu\u00f1oz family\u2019s attorneys have obtained test results that provide a little more insight in this area.\n\nAccording to the lawyers, the fetus has severe deformities in its lower extremities, so its gender is impossible to determine. It also suffers from hydrocephalus, a condition that involves excess fluid in the brain cavities and can lead to either mental disability or death. It may have a heart problem, although the attorneys say that the extent of the issues cannot yet be determined. The statement did not indicate whether the fetus is considered to be viable.\n\n\u201cQuite sadly, this information is not surprising due to the fact that the fetus, after being deprived of oxygen for an indeterminate length of time, is gestating within a dead and deteriorating body, as a horrified family looks on in absolute anguish, distress and sadness,\u201d the two attorneys representing the family, Jessica Janicek and Heather King, said in a statement.\n\nThe Mu\u00f1oz family has maintained that they are grieving both Mu\u00f1oz and her unborn child, and simply want to give them a proper burial. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about pro-life or pro-choice,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s father, Ernest Machado, told the Dallas News earlier this month. \u201cWe want to say goodbye. We want to let them rest.\u201d\n\nAs the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports, there isn\u2019t enough scientific research into this area to definitively predict whether a brain dead woman can deliver a viable child. Typically, it depends on the gestational age at the time of brain death and the length of time the fetus was deprived of oxygen. There have been a few successful documented cases, however, including a healthy baby delivered at a Hungarian hospital last year.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Marlise Munoz, the brain dead woman whose pregnancy is now 22 weeks along, is carrying a fetus that's \"distinctly abnormal.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Marlise Munoz, the brain dead woman whose pregnancy is now 22 weeks along, is carrying a fetus that's \"distinctly abnormal.\"", "title": "Attorneys Confirm The Brain-Dead Texas Woman\u2019s Fetus Suffers From Severe Abnormalities", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/01/23/3195441/munoz-fetus-abnormalities/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/munoz.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Marlise Munoz, the brain dead woman whose pregnancy is now 22 weeks along, is carrying a fetus that's \"distinctly abnormal.\"", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/munoz-321x214.jpg", "title": "Attorneys Confirm The Brain-Dead Texas Woman\u2019s Fetus Suffers From Severe Abnormalities", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/munoz.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/munoz.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-23T08:57:39+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc80f\"", "article_summary": "Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s family has repeatedly pointed out that the fetus may have suffered severe abnormalities as a result of Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s brain death.\nThe Mu\u00f1oz family has maintained that they are grieving both Mu\u00f1oz and her unborn child, and simply want to give them a proper burial.\nMu\u00f1oz\u2019s family, on the other hand, says that law doesn\u2019t apply in this case because Mu\u00f1oz is already dead.\nThe hospital is citing an obscure Texas law that forbids the state from removing \u201clife-sustaining treatment\u201d from a pregnant woman.\nWe want to let them rest.\u201dAs the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports, there isn\u2019t enough scientific research into this area to definitively predict whether a brain dead woman can deliver a viable child."}
