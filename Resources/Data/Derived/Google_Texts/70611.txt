Campbell Soup Company's product Prego, a tomato sauce that can be used on spaghetti, has been recalled due to the risk of spoilage.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced Tuesday that Campbell Soup Co., well-known for its canned and microwavable soups, has voluntarily recalled some 300 cases of Prego Traditional Italian sauce due to the risk of them being spoiled.

The food manufacturing company had reportedly been doing a routine inspection of its products when it discovered that the sauce inside several of the 24-ounce jars was spoiled. Prego, which means “you’re welcome” in Italian, is a red tomato sauce often used for pasta, chicken parmesan, or other classic Italian dinners, according to Campbell's Kitchen.

The FDA report states that the Prego sauces were manufactured on Dec. 15, 2013, and have an expiration, or “Best By” date of June 16, 2015. They were made in Paris, Texas, and shipped to several distribution centers in Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. The products in question also have a four-digit, military time code ranging between “CT BJ ZV 0330” through “CT BJ ZV 0449.”

“Consumers who have purchased the product should not eat it,” the FDA report states. Though no reported cases of illness have surfaced, the FDA urges consumers to “return the product to the store where the product was purchased for a full refund.”

The Campbell Prego incident appears to be one of the first food recalls of 2014. Wal-Mart also announced today that they would recall “Five Spice” donkey meat sold in locations in China, due to the fact that DNA from other animals — including foxes — was found in it.
