PETERSBURG \u2014 A fire ripped through a St. Petersburg church Sunday morning, displacing its congregation for the morning services and changing polling locations for the Aug. 26 primary election.\n\nAround 1:30 a.m. Sunday, St. Petersburg Fire Rescue responded to a three alarm fire at Vietnamese Evangelical Church, 4344 21st St. N. No one was injured in the fire, but flames leapt through the roof of the 60-by-80-foot building, and downed nearby power lines.\n\nInvestigators are still looking into what caused the fire, but believe it started in the church\u2019s kitchen, located in the center of the building. None of the surrounding homes nestled near the building were damaged, but the church appeared completely gutted.\n\nTam Tran, a church elder, sat in the gold church van across the street from the smoldering building Sunday morning, windows rolled up to keep out the smell of charred wood. He had just gone to bed after a family meeting at the church, which is affiliated with the United Methodists, when the church\u2019s fire alarm called his cell phone.\n\nThe damaged building has housed his congregation for 16 years and one month, Tram said. Congregation members have been planning for the church\u2019s 30 year anniversary on Oct. 4.\n\n\u201cThe church means so much to the community. My teenage daughter was crying this morning when she heard the service was cancelled,\u201d Tran said. \u201cMy family has been very blessed by the church members, and I know god will continue to bless the church. ... Now we just need another plan.\u201d\n\nOther memebrs of the 250-person congregation wandered around the church campus still dressed in their Sunday best, looking in windows at what instruments and furnishings could be salvaged.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just here to pray that firefighters can find out what happened and for God to open another door for another church,\u201d said church member Dao Le, who commutes from Tampa every Sunday and Wednesday to attend the church. \u201cIt\u2019s one church, one family, one mission and we always laugh and love together.\n\nThough Sunday\u2019s services were cancelled, church members said they hope to hold their regular services in members\u2019 homes or in other local church buildings.\n\nThe church acted as a polling place for Precinct 139. On Election Day, those voters must now go to Roberts Recreation Center, 1246 50th Ave. N. in St. Petersburg, at the southwest corner of 50th Avenue North and 12th Street North, said Nancy Whitlock, communications director for the Pinellas County Supervisor of Elections. Election staff will call and email voters to alert them to the change, as well as station staff at the church to redirect voters on Election Day with maps and directions.\n\nadawson@tampatrib.com\n\n(727) 215-9851\n\nTwitter: @adawsonTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 24 Aug 2014 12:06:55 -0400", "Description": "ST.
