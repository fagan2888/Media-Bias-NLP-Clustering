Ted Cruz promised during a nighttime speech in his home state that he would kill the Affordable Care Act, \u201cabolish\u201d the Internal Revenue Service, stop amnesty and rebuild the military.\n\nShortly after Florida Sen.

Cruz pointed to the specific freedoms as religious beliefs and protecting citizens\u2019 Second Amendment rights to own firearms. And when it comes to security he cited former Republican President Ronald Reagan and how he bolstered the military to win the Cold War as a model for how we would, if elected, take on ISIS.\n\nCruz also promised to reform the Internal Revenue Service by instituting a flat tax, ending amnesty and welfare benefits for people living in America illegally, and getting the government \u201coff the backs\u201d of small business owners across the country.\n\n[Like Healthcare IT News on Facebook]\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll fire regulators,\u201d Cruz explained. \u201cLess government is more freedom.\u201d\n\nAlthough Ohio Rep. Governor John Kasich is still running, Cruz is calling it a two-candidate race at this point.\n\nWhat with Trump\u2019s 621 delegates versus Cruz\u2019s 396 and primary elections in winner-take-all states such as California, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin still to come, it\u2019s still too soon to say that either Cruz or Trump is precluded from winning the nomination ahead of the Republican National Convention come July 18-21, 2016.\n\nTwitter: @SullyHIT", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texas Republican Sen.
