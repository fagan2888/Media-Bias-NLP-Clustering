According to that theory, the tunnel was later closed and its location long forgotten.\n\nAccording to Radio Wroclaw, the 150-metre-(495-foot)-long train was carrying guns, \"industrial equipment\", gems and other valuable treasure. Tokarska said she did not have any details on the location or the contents of the missing train.\n\nSome skeptics say there is no evidence that it ever existed.\n\n\u201cA handful of people have already looked for the train, damaging the line in the process, but nothing was ever found,\u201d Radio Wroclaw quoted Joanna Lamparska as saying, describing her as a connoisseur of the region\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cBut the legend has captured imaginations.\u201d\n\nTrains were indeed used to spirit Nazi loot back to Berlin as U.S.-led Allied and Soviet forces surged toward the German capital from the west and the east in the winter and spring of 1945.\n\nIn the case of the so-called \"Gold Train\", Nazi forces sent 24 freight carriages from Budapest toward Germany filled with family treasures including gold, silver and valuable paintings seized from Hungarian Jews and estimated to be worth up to $200 million.\n\nThe train was intercepted by U.S. soldiers, who, according to a later U.S. investigation, helped themselves to some of the loot.\n\n(Reporting by Alexandra Hamilton; Writing by Matt Robinson; Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Poland looking into report of Nazi treasure train found - Reuters News:     By Alexandra Hamilton    .05/26/2016 4:11:08AM EST.", "author": "Reuters News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "By Alexandra Hamilton    WARSAW (Reuters) - Two people", "title": "Reuters News - Poland looking into report of Nazi treasure train found", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2015/08/19/poland-looking-into-report-of-nazi-treasure-train-found-n2040922", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "By Alexandra Hamilton    WARSAW (Reuters) - Two people", "title": "Reuters News - Poland looking into report of Nazi treasure train found", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2015/08/19/poland-looking-into-report-of-nazi-treasure-train-found-n2040922", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Poland looking into report of Nazi treasure train found, Reuters News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd310\"", "article_summary": "Tokarska said she did not have any details on the location or the contents of the missing train.\nOne local media report said the train was armored and belonged to the Wehrmacht (Nazi Germany's military).\nAccording to Radio Wroclaw, the 150-metre-(495-foot)-long train was carrying guns, \"industrial equipment\", gems and other valuable treasure.\nThe train was intercepted by U.S. soldiers, who, according to a later U.S. investigation, helped themselves to some of the loot.\nRadio Wroclaw cited local folklore as saying the train entered a tunnel near Ksiaz Castle in the mountainous Lower Silesian region and never emerged."}
