The number of billionaires is expected to continue to climb, too. Wealth-X predicts that by 2020, the global billionaire population (currently 2,170) will increase by 1,700 individuals to nearly 3,900 people worldwide.

Today’s billionaires sure aren’t shy about spending their money. They’resetting spending records for fine art, real estate and gems.

Part of the reason: Even as the stock market hits records highs, lingering uncertainty about future gains has billionaires looking for other places to stash their cash. In the past five years, investments in luxury goods like art, cars, wine and watches have increased 15 percent, according to research firm WealthInsight.

With billionaires so easily spending money on themselves, gift-givers with a billionaire on their shopping list can feel a lot of pressure. Face it: You’re just not going to find the perfect gift on the racks at Macy’s on Black Friday.

Holiday gifts are different for high rollers, for whom money is no object and exclusivity is a must. After all, the average billionaire already owns four homes (worth an average $20 million each) and a yacht (worth an average $78 million).
