And 26 percent of Republicans still believe there are death panels? And only five percent of people actually know one of the most important facts of Obamacare: that it's costing less than expected\u201442 percent of all voters, Democrats and Republicans, get that one wrong.\n\nOn this fifth anniversary of the law being signed, it's a good opportunity to review the false predictions and the facts of the law's first five years. Here's just a handful of Republican prediction failures:\n\n\n\nFailed Prediction #1: Americans won\u2019t enroll in the ACA [\u2026]\n\nFailed Prediction #2: The ACA won\u2019t meet its enrollment goals [\u2026]\n\nFailed Prediction #3: Insurers will want no part of the ACA system [\u2026]\n\nFailed Prediction #4: The economy will suffer terribly because of \u2018Obamacare\u2019 [\u2026]\n\nFailed Prediction #5: Even if Americans enrolled, they won\u2019t pay their premiums [\u2026]\n\nFailed Prediction #6: Even if people pay their premiums, the flawed ACA structure will send premiums soaring [\u2026]\n\nFailed Prediction #7: The ACA won\u2019t reduce the uninsured rate because it will only help those who already have coverage [\u2026]\n\nFailed Prediction #8: The ACA will lead to a \u201cnet loss\u201d on overall coverage [\u2026]\n\nFailed Prediction #9: The ACA will lead to higher deficits and a weaker fiscal footing for the nation [\u2026]\n\nFailed Prediction #10: Americans will end up hating the coverage they receive through the ACA [\u2026]\n\n\u2022 Nearly 30 million Americans have gotten health insurance under Obamacare.\n\n\u2022 The rate of uninsured adults has dropped to 12.3%. [\u2026]\n\n\u2022 Number of adults without health insurance in 2013: 41 million. Today: 30 million.\n\n\u2022 Percentage of insurance exchange customers who'd previously been uninsured: 57% [\u2026]\n\n\u2022 Number of times Congress has voted to repeal Obamacare (so far): 56\n\n\u2022 63% of Americans say Republicans have no alternative to Obamacare. [\u2026]\n\n\u2022 Americans who could lose subsidies for federal insurance exchanges if the Supreme Court rules against them later this year: 13.4 million\n\nThat's a whole lot of fail. Just take a look at this list of 20 statistics proving how the law is working to demonstrate how humungously Republicans have failed. Some highlights:In five years, Republicans have come up with nothing but fail in response to the law: no plan of their own, no recognition of reality, nothing but \"no.\" That's worked for them, so far. But if the Supreme Court grants their fondest desire, and guts the law, fail isn't going to be an option anymore.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Did you know ...", "title": "Five years on, Obamacare myths still prevail", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/3/23/1372751/-Five-years-on-Obamacare-myths-still-prevail", "image": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/132319/story_image/RTR4S23G.jpg?1425490888", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "Did you know that 39 percent of Republicans still believe that undocumented immigrants can get Obamacare?
