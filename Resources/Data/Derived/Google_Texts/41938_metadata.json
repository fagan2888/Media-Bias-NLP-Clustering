And the disparity is much greater over a longer period of time. Since 1978, inflation-adjusted CEO compensation has risen by nearly 1,000 percent \u2014 almost double the stock market\u2019s gains over that period, and about 100 times the 10.9 percent growth in the average worker\u2019s pay gains over those three and a half decades.\n\nTo put that in dollar terms, the average CEO pay package among executives at those large companies, including exercised stock options, was $16.3 million in 2014, the new analysis estimates. The typical worker made a little more than $50,000. And while the ratio of CEO pay to that of the average worker has declined in recent years \u2014 falling to 303-to-1 in 2014 from a peak of 376-to-1 in 2000 \u2014 CEOs still earn far more relative to other workers than they had in the 1960s, \u201870s, \u201880s or \u201890s, the report says.\n\nCEOs make up just a small fraction of the top 1 percent of earners, but their rising compensation has a sizable influence on the widening of the income gap. \u201cThese extraordinary pay increases have had spillover effects in pulling up the pay of other executives and managers, who constitute a larger group of workers than is commonly recognized,\u201d the report by EPI\u2019s Lawrence Mishel and Alyssa Davis says.\n\nAt the same time, the study says that CEO pay has also far outpaced the long-term gains made by the top 0.1 percent of earners. As of 2013, the average CEO at a large company made about six times as much as the top 0.1 percent of wage earners.\n\nThe authors argue that these gains show that CEO pay doesn\u2019t simply reflect the growing value of top professionals in a competitive market for talent but instead is a sign of the power CEOs wield in extracting concessions from the companies and directors who set their pay. As a result, they conclude that cutting CEO pay or taxing it more wouldn\u2019t have far-reaching consequences for economic output or employment.\n\nSimilarly, the report also shows how CEO pay rises and falls with the stock market (as CEOs exercise their stock options when share prices are high). That broad-based alignment, the authors say, is an argument against the idea that CEOs have earned substantial pay increases by their standout individual performance.\n\n\u201cCEO compensation often grows strongly simply when the overall stock market rises and individual firms\u2019 stock values rise along with it,\u201d they write. \u201cIt seems evident that individual CEOs are not responsible for this broad improvement in profits in the past few years, but they clearly are benefiting from it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s good to be CEO, though maybe not quite as good as it was 15 years ago.", "title": "CEO Pay Below 2000 Peak \u2013 but Still 300 Times the Average Worker", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/22/Top-CEOs-Paid-300-Times-Average-Worker", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10152010_money_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/06/22/Top-CEOs-Paid-300-Times-Average-Worker", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10152010_money_article.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s good to be CEO, though maybe not quite as good as it was 15 years ago.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc960\"", "article_summary": "As of 2013, the average CEO at a large company made about six times as much as the top 0.1 percent of wage earners.\nAs a result, they conclude that cutting CEO pay or taxing it more wouldn\u2019t have far-reaching consequences for economic output or employment.\nSimilarly, the report also shows how CEO pay rises and falls with the stock market (as CEOs exercise their stock options when share prices are high).\n\u201cCEO compensation often grows strongly simply when the overall stock market rises and individual firms\u2019 stock values rise along with it,\u201d they write.\nTo put that in dollar terms, the average CEO pay package among executives at those large companies, including exercised stock options, was $16.3 million in 2014, the new analysis estimates."}
