And they will also be juggling re-enrollment and post-enrollment questions from consumers who signed up last year. But they learned a lot last year. They know where the uninsured like to hang out (public libraries in Tennessee, fire stations in Maryland) and how to hook young people (food trucks) And they\u2019ve developed new consumer resources and undergone additional training. Natalie Villacorta has our story: http://politico.pro/1wuaRTw\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWelcome to Thursday morning Pulse, where we think Pennsylvania might have happened on a way to deal with physician shortages. National Journal reports that the state\u2019s liquor code allows \u201chospitals desirous of obtaining confiscated liquor\u201d can apply for it, and right now officials are sitting on a motherlode of 2,447 bottles of wine confiscated from an illegal trader. We wonder if there\u2019s anything about news organizations on Virginia\u2019s booze books. National Journal: http://bit.ly/1nzGIjQ\n\n\u201cJust one thing makes PULSE forget: Red, red wine.\u201d\n\nFIRST IN PULSE: FAMILY MEDICINE COALTION LAUNCHES PRIMARY CARE CAMPAIGN \u2014 Today Family Medicine for America\u2019s Health, a new coalition of eight family physician groups, including the American Academy of Family Physicians, is launching an education campaign on the role of primary care in health care delivery reform. Health is Primary will use advertising and other forms of outreach to advocate a primary care-based health system. In this system, doctors have long-term relationships with patients and treat the whole person; technology is used to facilitate those doctor-patient relationships; prevention is as important as treatment. The campaign will offer tools to meet these goals and will travel cross country to engage stakeholders, including policymakers, patients and employees.

Pro will be there.\n\nREYNOLDS AMERICAN ADDS SMOKING RESTRICTIONS \u2014 The nation\u2019s second largest tobacco company told employees Wednesday that starting next year, they will no longer be allowed to smoke cigarettes, cigars or pipes in company offices, conference rooms, hallways and elevators. Smoking is already banned on the factory floors, in the cafeterias and fitness centers. The updated policy will go into effect once designated indoor smoking areas have been constructed. E-cigarettes, dipping tobacco and other smokeless tobacco products will still be permitted indoors. Reynolds American spokesman David Howard says the company feels the new policy better accommodates both nonsmokers and smokers who work in and visit its facilities. More from POLITICO: http://politico.pro/1ymXGmD\n\n\u2014 The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network lauded the move, but noted that millions of Americans are still exposed to unwanted cigarette smoke in work settings and public places. \u201cIf Reynolds cared about the American public as much as it does its own workers, the company would support comprehensive smoke-free policies nationwide that protect people from its own products and those of other tobacco companies, including policies that prohibit special smoking areas that have proven to be ineffective in protecting non-tobacco users from tobacco smoke,\u201d said ACS CAN President Chris Hansen.\n\nDAVITA TO PAY $350 MILLION TO RESOLVE KICKBACK CLAIMS \u2014 The Justice Department announced late last night that the dialysis provider Davita Healthcare Partners, Inc., will pay $350 million to settle allegations that it violated the False Claims Act by paying for referrals. The Denver-based company is accused of finding physician practices with a lot of renal patients and giving them financial stakes in their dialysis clinics. Davita also pushed the physicians into non-compete agreements to keep them funneling patients into their clinics, which operate in 46 states. More on the alleged scheme from the DOJ: http://1.usa.gov/1FFyZqo\n\nWHEN DOES A MALPRACTICE CAP MATTER? \u2014 Payments to plaintiffs in malpractice cases are genuinely decreased when damages are capped at $250,000 a new study finds, but the cap is less relevant when reaches $500,000. This has implications for California\u2019s Prop 46 ballot measure, Pro\u2019s Rachana Pradhan reports, which would raise the limit on damages to $1.1 million. The study\u2019s authors predict that the initiative\u2019s passage \u201cwould lead to about a 20 percent increase in average malpractice payouts \u2014 and more in obstetrics and gynecology, as well as pediatrics.\u201d The Pro article: http://politico.pro/12eYAXL\n\nPOTUS CALLS PRESBY STAFF \u2014 President Barack Obama called the staff at Texas Health Presbyterian in Dallas yesterday to \u201cthank them for their courage and perseverance in dealing with the first cases of Ebola to appear in the United States,\u201d according to a White House readout. Obama paid tribute to the two infected nurses and \u201cemphasized the importance of integrating lessons learned from Dallas into response plans going forward, and reviewed the additional steps that have been taken to strengthen the Nation\u2019s ability to respond quickly and effectively.\u201d He also praised the staff for \u201cstaying focused on the vital mission of caring for others in times of need regardless of the difficult circumstances.\u201d\n\nREPORTS: VINSON\u2019S FAMILY SAYS SHE\u2019S EBOLA-FREE \u2014 The family of Amber Joy Vinson, the second nurse infected with Ebola, is saying that there are no longer signs of the virus in her body, and that she\u2019s slated to be moved to a different unit at Emory University Hospital. No confirmation as of late Wednesday night from the CDC or Emory. http://bit.ly/1zl5WI9\n\n$31 MILLION TO PROMOTE DIVERSITY IN BIOMED RESEARCH \u2014 NIH announced $31 million in new grants to develop new ways of drawing in underrepresented groups in the biomedical sciences. The awards are going to 50 geographically diverse institutions over what\u2019s expected to be a five-year project.

Oklahoma District Court Judge Robert Stuart rejected a request from abortion rights groups to block the measure. The order does not appear to have been formally issued yet. http://reut.rs/1ynbEF8\n\nCALLING ON BUSINESS TO HELP EXPAND SCOPE OF PRACTICE \u2014 At a speech to the Chamber of Commerce\u2019s health summit yesterday, the head of the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists called for employers to ask their health plans to use a range of advanced practice registered nurses to their full scope of practice a way of lowering costs. Businesses \u201chave a golden opportunity to change the system for the better by ensuring that their employee benefits fully cover\u201d these advanced nursing services the same as physicians.\n\nLUNG ASSOCIATION NAMES RIZZO TOP DOC \u2014 The American Lung Association named Albert Rizzo its Senior Medical Adviser \u2014 which also makes him their top spokesman. He\u2019s chief of pulmonary and critical care medicine for Christiana Care Health Systems in Wilmington, Del.\n\nSURVEY: JUST ABOUT ANYTHING BETTER THAN OPEN ENROLLMENT \u2014 PlanSource, a benefits administrator, came up with a novel way to market its new OneMarket private exchange: point out how much people hate choosing employer-sponsored plans during open enrollment. In a poll of 2,000 people, compared to enrolling; 23 percent of people said they\u2019d rather see the dentist; 20 percent would rather watch a movie about the life of Lindsay Lohan; 14 percent would rather star on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d with Donald Trump and 13 percent would rather be a telemarketer. We have no idea if their exchange is as clever as their marketing strategy, but here\u2019s their site: http://bit.ly/1xb67Af\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE READING, by Jennifer Haberkorn\n\nObamacare is returning as an election \"albatross\" for Democrats, Karl Rove writes in the Wall Street Journal. http://on.wsj.com/1vQbsPj\n\nScientists will gather next month to consider how robots could be used to help stem the Ebola epidemic, the New York Times reports. http://nyti.ms/1yZYjFL\n\nA new study says that if there are no exit screenings in place as people leave West Africa, and estimated three people with Ebola would leave the region each month, the AP reports. http://wapo.st/1nzKtpx\n\nEbola lobbying has begun. A Florida-based company is lobbying the government to use its automated disinfecting system, Bloomberg reports. Bono's ONE campaign is in the Ebola lobbying game, too. http://bit.ly/1vQfabH\n\nSam's Club is getting into the Obamacare game with its own private insurance exchange, the Post reports. http://wapo.st/1yZZANd\n\nAetna on Thursday announced a new ACO model in Washington state, where some insurers have faced criticism for narrow networks. The Seattle Times story: http://bit.ly/1ow9z9u\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): Many Medicare drug plans effectively require the use of \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies that are inconvenient for patients. That means a long trip or higher copays to stick with the pharmacies that patients like. In urban areas, these plans often fail to meet the government\u2019s standard for pharmacy access. In rural areas, \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies are often 20+ miles away! Support H.R. 793 / S. 1190. This bipartisan legislation is supported by leading consumer advocates and would let patients use any pharmacy willing to accept the \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacy terms and conditions.
