The bill had written in exemptions for employees younger than 18 and seasonal employees who work fewer than 90 days a year as well as all agriculture workers.\n\n\u201cThis bill caused great concern and anxiety, not just on the shore, but all across this great state of Maryland,\u201d said Sen. Jim Mathias (D-District 38A). \u201cWe have to find a balance between helping our workers and protecting the employers.\u201d\n\nYet, this year, the bill gained momentum in Annapolis and breezed through the House of Delegates last week in a decisive 89-54 vote. All 49 House Republicans and six Democrats voted against the bill in the House, including Republican Delegate Mary Beth Carozza, who pushed for an amendment to the bill, which would give an exemption to businesses who only employ people for 120 days or less.\n\nShe claimed the 120-day exemption was much more conducive to the summer season in Ocean City and seasonal businesses\u2019 hiring habits.\n\nThe amendment, which failed in the house, but was \u201cmost certainly heard\u201d in the Senate, according to Carozza, was an increase of the 90-day exemption for employers, and was an attempt to somewhat mirror the complete exemption given to the agriculture jobs.\n\n\u201cI absolutely believe that the 120-day amendment played a role in the Senate\u2019s decision to let the clock run out,\u201d said Carozza. \u201cI think the collective feedback that we got from concerned business owners on the shore and across the state pointed out the unintended consequences of this bill in its current form for seasonal businesses.\u201d\n\nMathias says there very well could have been the support to pass the bill, but the timing surrounding the House\u2019s passage of the bill left debate and vote in the Senate an unlikely mountain to climb.\n\n\u201cThis version of the bill was simply unrealistic,\u201d said Mathias. \u201cOur economy continues to recover from the recession and I think people are finally starting to adjust to the Affordable Care Act. Our employers pay what they know they can afford, and they want to take care of their people.\u201d\n\nYet, despite the bill\u2019s dramatic rise, and deflating demise in the final minutes of the session, neither Mathias nor Carozza believe this debate is over.\n\n\u201cI expect it to come back next session,\u201d she said, \u201cbut, I believe advocates will be ready for it.\u201d\n\nYet, advocates on the other side of the argument, including Delegate Dereck Davis (D-District 25) say the argument about similar legislation is little more than political fear-mongering.\n\n\u201cEvery time we try to do something for workers, it\u2019s going to kill business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to chase people out. You hear that time and time again, it\u2019s going to be a job killer, yet, we\u2019re still here.\u201d\n\nMathias says if this bill eventually passes, he hopes it will create a balance and not eliminate jobs altogether.\n\n\u201cWith the growth of the online marketplace and technology, there are many employers who may put touch screens on the table in the restaurants rather than hire waiters and waitresses,\u201d said Mathias. \u201cThe evolution is happening, and there is growing support for this bill. So, we need to really be concerned about keeping these positions, having people do the job, and not losing these jobs to technology.\u201d\n\nCarozza also concedes a version of the bill may pass someday, but she is both hopeful and confident that the 120-day exemption for seasonal businesses will eventually find its way into the bill.\n\n\u201cYou can have a paid sick leave bill that works for both the workers and the employers,\u201d she said. \u201cI could support a bill like this if the seasonal businesses were given that 120-day exemption.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "HandheldFriendly": "True"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou can have a paid sick leave bill that works for both the workers and the employers,\u201d she said.\nANNAPOLIS \u2014 Eastern Shore legislators called the last minute death of the highly debated paid sick leave bill in the Maryland Senate a \u201chuge sigh of relief\u201d for seasonal business owners.\nAdditionally, the bill would also require companies with fewer than 15 employees to offer the same amount of unpaid sick leave.\nLocally, seasonal businesses were concerned because the bill would have required every business with more than 15 employees, both full and part time, to pay their workers\u2019 sick leave.\n\u201cI could support a bill like this if the seasonal businesses were given that 120-day exemption.\u201d"}
