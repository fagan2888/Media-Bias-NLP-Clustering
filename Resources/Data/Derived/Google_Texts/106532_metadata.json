Much like the failure to change nature\u2019s principles in search of longevity or turning lead into gold, one\u2019s ability lead develops slowly over time and with much strain.\n\n10 Lessons Learned in Search of Success as a Leader:\n\n1. You\u2019re always an apprentice. If you think you\u2019ve mastered this, you\u2019re failing. Approach each day eager to learn another lesson, and you will. Approach each day assuming you\u2019ve got this role licked, and you\u2019ll get clobbered when you least expect it.\n\n2. Great leaders require great missions. It\u2019s the humdrum of the mundane of the status quo that squashes the spirits of leaders and the people around them. If you\u2019re not on a mission, create one. If you\u2019re leading others, know that your job is to define the mission. Not the mission statement, the mission.\n\n3. The only job harder than leading is likely being a mother. Scratch that \u2014 mothers are the original leaders.\n\n4. What you did yesterday doesn\u2019t count. What you\u2019ll do tomorrow doesn\u2019t count. Lead today. It\u2019s the only day that counts.\n\n5. You\u2019re supposed to be uncomfortable. That\u2019s the job. Get over it. Get used to it. Revel in it. Or, get another job.\n\n6. No one does anything for you \u2014 they do it for themselves.\n\n7. Sometimes you have to push the ones with the greatest potential out of the nest. Your instinct says to do everything possible to retain them. The right thing to do is to help them find the best opportunities to grow. Even if that means shoving them on their way.\n\n8. Enjoy the burn. It\u2019s the tough days and tough issues, especially your failures that mold you into a better leader.\n\n9. Hire people who\u2019ve struggled and persevered. I\u2019ll take the person who held down three jobs to pay for college while caring for the sick relative any day of the week.\n\n10. Pedigree is interesting, but character counts. When hiring, hire for character first and the rest will follow.\n\nThere are no shortcuts when it comes to learning to lead effectively. Get on with it, you\u2019ve got some mistakes to make. Just make them faster to succeed sooner.\n\nArt Petty is a coach and consultant working with executives and management teams to unlock business and human potential.
