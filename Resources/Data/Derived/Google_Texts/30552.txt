Federal aviation officials say pilot inexperience is the likely cause of 2012 plane crash that killed a Kansas businessman, his wife and their four children in a swampy area of Florida.

The National Transportation Safety Board released its findings earlier this week. The report noted that Ronald Bramlage had purchased the turboprop plane about five weeks before crashing about 50 miles southwest of Orlando, Fla.

The Junction City businessman was returning home with his family after a vacation in the Bahamas when the plane's autopilot disengaged. A statement of probable cause from the NTSB found that Bramlage could not maintain control of the aircraft.

Ronald Bramlage was the grandson of Fred Bramlage, the namesake of Kansas State University's basketball arena.
