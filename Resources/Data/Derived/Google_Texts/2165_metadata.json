Owner and developer Lisa Lynn Bowdery completed this property, which is built on about half an acre, earlier this year. \"My husband is a perfectionist and, together, we spent a long time reviewing the design to ensure that the house was exactly as we wanted,\" says Ms. Bowdery. Knight Frank \u2026\n\nBefore Sunning Place was built, there was a 1950s-style property on the plot, says Ms. Bowdery. \"When we bought the land to develop, I actually discovered a diary dating back to the time that the property was built. It was absolutely fascinating to read about what life was like in those days,\" she says. Knight Frank \u2026\n\n\"We paid particular attention to ensuring that the reception space, kitchen/dining area and bedroom accommodation were designed in a way that would achieve the ultimate in modern family living,\" explains Ms. Bowdery. There are five reception rooms in all. There is also a studio flat above the separately built two-car garage. Knight Frank \u2026\n\nAttention to detail has been important in the construction of this house. The soft furnishings of the house, for example, were supplied by So Chic Interior Design, a company with a royal warrant. \"I spend a lot of time in Spain and find that the lighting fixtures made in this country are of a really superior quality,\" says Ms. Bowdery. She shipped in the lighting from Spain to make sure that all aspects of the house were of \"the highest standard.\" Knight Frank \u2026\n\nThe bespoke kitchen has Gaggenau appliances and an integrated wine cooler and a Quooker hot tap. There is also an additional pantry, and a large utility room more than 10-feet-square. Knight Frank \u2026\n\nThe house has six bedrooms, five of which have en-suite bathrooms. There are fitted wardrobes in most of the bedrooms. The house has state-of-the-art smart technology throughout, including a multiroom entertainment system, with tablet and remote controls. The house is secured with CCTV and a video door-entry system.
