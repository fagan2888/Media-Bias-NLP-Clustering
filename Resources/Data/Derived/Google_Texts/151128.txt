COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The Ohio Democratic Party has added two people who had roles in President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign to focus on energizing the base and getting out the vote.

The party announced Steve Sisneros as its new field director and Nelson Devezin as its new political director. Together they will lead the party’s grassroots organizing efforts.

The two positions have similar functions and work collaboratively, said Meredith Tucker, the party’s communications director. The field director focuses on participation at the grassroots level, developing strategies to bolster participation and voter turnout. The political director works with county parties, outside organizations that support the ODP and other activists in a similar fashion.

Sisneros previously oversaw nine states as deputy national regional director for Organizing for Action, the successor to the Obama re-election campaign. It is a non-profit social action organization formed in 2013 following Obama’s re-election.

He previously was a deputy field director for the Obama re-election campaign in Nevada.

Devezin, a native of Shaker Heights, was a regional field director for Obama’s re-election campaign. Previously he worked on the Cleveland Public Library’s levy renewal campaign and also has experience working with Planned Parenthood’s Affordable Care Act program in Cleveland.

He worked for the Ohio Democratic Party in 2010 as a field organizer.
