The King v. Burwell case was the GOP\u2019s last chance to get a court ruling that would effectively gut the ACA. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kennedy sided with the majority and wrote the opinion.\n\nRepublican presidential candidates will use this ruling as fodder for their platform of overturning Obamacare, but a recent CBS poll found that more people approve of Obamacare than disapprove of the ACA.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s legacy has been validated. All the talk of trade agreements and other issues being legacy defining was nothing more than political chatter. Obama\u2019s legacy is the ACA.\n\nThe Supreme Court said that subsidies were available to all Americans. The size of this victory for President Obama and Democrats can\u2019t be underestimated. Republicans have been crushed by the High Court today as 6.4 million Americans will get to keep their affordable healthcare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a decision that crushed Republican hopes of using the judicial system to gut Obamacare, the Supreme Court ruled by a 6-3 margin that the subsidies are constitutional under the ACA.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "In a decision that crushed Republican hopes of using the judicial system to gut Obamacare, the Supreme Court ruled by a 6-3 margin that the subsidies are constitutional under the ACA.", "title": "Obama Gets A Gigantic Win As Supreme Court Rules ACA Subsidies Are Constitutional 6-3", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/06/25/obama-gigantic-win-supreme-court-rules-aca-subsidies-constitutional-6-3.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ObamaSmile2.png", "updated_time": "2015-06-25T10:45:25+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,king v. burwell decision,Obamcare subsidies ruled constitutional,Supreme Court ACA subsidies constitutional,Supreme rules for Obamacare subsidies,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-06-25T10:19:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-25T10:45:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "king v. burwell decision, Obamcare subsidies ruled constitutional, Supreme Court ACA subsidies constitutional, Supreme rules for Obamacare subsidies"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd7c\"", "article_summary": "The King v.
