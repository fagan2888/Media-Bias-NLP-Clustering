That\u2019s why they developed the system of the separation of powers with the judicial branch, the executive branch, and the legislative branch, each acting as an important constitutional actor in our political stage; each checking the power of the other.\u201d\n\nAnd Mohler warned: \u201cFor President Obama, immediately after this election to act unilaterally in this way will endanger not only the future of genuine immigration reform but it will also endanger the nation in terms of the separation of powers and it will endanger our constitutional experiment in government and that in itself would be an unspeakable tragedy.\u201d\n\nMohler\u2019s critique of executive amnesty is notable. Much of Evangelical political witness in recent years has been detached from abstract principles of responsible constitutional governance and more attuned to emotive appeals for urgent action to address compelling injustices. Widely publicized Evangelical support for legislation to legalize millions of illegal immigrants often romanticized the undocumented as biblical sojourners deserving hospitality as God commanded of the ancient Hebrews in the Old Testament.\n\nThat U.S. immigration policy should be based on several Scripture passages simply urging kindness to strangers was a dubious claim but one that supposedly would mobilize millions of Evangelicals to compel the Republican House of Representatives to approve the Democratic Senate\u2019s legislation for mass legalization. Despite a well-funded and very polished lobby campaign by the Evangelical Immigration Table, Evangelicals did not mobilize in the hoped for numbers. And of course Congressional Republicans declined to consider the Senate\u2019s legislation.\n\nTo what extent Evangelicals who support mass legalization will address Obama\u2019s executive amnesty is not yet clear. Some Mainline Protestant officials representing United Methodists, the United Church of Christ, Church World Service and the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) joined Unitarian Universalists in August, as \u201ccitizens of the world,\u201d to urge the President towards \u201cexecutive action\u201d after \u201cCongress\u2019 refusal to enact immigration reform.\u201d These liberal church groups have long opposed nearly any immigration law enforcement as inherent injustice. And they are not renowned for their concerns about constitutional limits on executive authority when their version of social justice is impaired,\n\nAlmost as emphatic for a mass legalization as Mainline Protestant lobbying have been the U.S. Catholic bishops, who also seem to support executive amnesty. At their recent meeting in Baltimore, Seattle Auxiliary Bishop Eusebio L. Elizondo, chairman of the bishops\u2019 migration committee, said the bishops \u201cwould be derelict not to support administrative actions\u201d to prevent deportations of the undocumented.\n\nIn September Bishop Elizondo, with Bishop Kevin Vann, chair of the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, wrote the Department of Homeland Security urging executive action \u201cto protect undocumented individuals and families as soon as possible, within the limits of your executive authority,\u201d complaining that \u201cimmigration reform legislation [was] stalled in Congress,\u201d and declaring \u201cour nation can no longer wait to end the suffering of family separation caused by our broken immigration system.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what exactly the bishops understood to be the \u201climits of executive authority,\u201d but at least they admitted there are some, while still implying that legislation by Congress is a nuisance if not compliant with the demands du jour of social justice. Especially given the impact of the Obamacare HHS mandate on Catholic organizations, the bishops might be more wary of congressionally unauthorized \u201cexecutive authority.\u201d\n\nWhat Mohler cited as the \u201ccreeping caudillismo\u201d of unilateral executive authority should distress all religious groups across the political and theological spectrum, all of whom are threatened by any diminishment of the rule of law and the protections of divided powers. Leading members of the Evangelical Immigration Table, which includes Jim Wallis\u2019 Sojourners on the left, the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) in the middle, and the Southern Baptists on the right, are divided about Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration.\n\nJim Wallis after Obama\u2019s speech was enthusiastic. \u201cTonight, faith leaders and all those who have spent years trying to fix our broken immigration system should feel gratitude toward President Obama\u201d for heeding the \u201cbiblical call to \u2018welcome the stranger.\u2019\u201d Southern Baptist leader Russell Moore called Obama\u2019s action \u201cunwise and counterproductive\u201d for failing to seek \u201cconsensus through the legislative process.\u201d\n\nAn NAE statement after the midterm election urged Republicans to address immigration legislatively, which implied Congress should still have a role.\n\nBut will NAE and others look beyond their immediate policy objectives to publicly admit the dangerous implications of unilateral presidential action, as Mohler described? They may soon regret it if they don\u2019t. Rule of law, nurtured by centuries of tradition, is part of what attracts immigrants to America and protects the poor and most vulnerable. Can there be true biblical justice without it?\n\nMark D.
