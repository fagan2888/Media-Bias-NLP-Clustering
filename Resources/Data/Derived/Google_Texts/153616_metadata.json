Mark Walker, R-NC, and Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., hope to soothe these concerns through their A-PLUS Act.\n\nThis amendment would allow states to opt out of the nearly 80 federal programs under No Child Left Behind, giving them the option to direct federal education funding toward state-established programs instead.\n\n\u201cThe federal government should not be imposing mandates on states and local communities regarding K-12 education,\u201d DeSantis said in a statement. \u201cThe amendment that we are offering liberates states from burdensome and ineffective regulations, providing local communities with the flexibility to use federal education funding for programs that they believe will best increase the success of students in the classroom.\u201d\n\nConservatives also argued the House\u2019s rendition of No Child Left Behind, introduced and sponsored by Minnesota Republican John Kline, chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, did not do enough to scale back spending.\n\nThe House proposal costs $23.2 billion, nearly matching NCLB\u2019s $24 billion, according to The Heritage Foundation.\n\nIn February, the White House threatened to veto the rewrite, the Student Success Act, because it includes a measure allowing states to link federal dollars to individual students in low-income areas as opposed to the school district itself.\n\nSupporters of what\u2019s known as \u201cportability\u201d say it allows children in low-income areas to move to better schools since the funding is attached to the individual student rather than the school district.\n\nOpponents, namely Democrats, argue that portability makes failing schools worse off by taking funds out of low-income districts and giving it to wealthier schools.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s version of the Student Success Act, called the Every Child Achieves Act, stripped out the portability measure to garner enough support from Democrats.\n\nThe Senate will likely begin floor debate on its bill Tuesday, which passed the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee unanimously in April with bipartisan support.\n\nThe bill ends some of No Child Left Behind\u2019s harsh federal accountability mandates, allowing states to establish their own systems using test scores, graduation rates and state-selected criteria to measure a school\u2019s performance.\n\nThough the Senate proposal increases states\u2019 flexibility in assessing performance, the bill would maintain the rigid testing standards under No Child Left Behind.\n\nSen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., introduced an amendment that reduces the testing from occurring annually in grades 3-8 to happening once each in elementary, middle and high school.\n\nThis week is only the beginning of the overdue education debate.\n\nEven if the Senate is able to maintain most of its original bill and the House passes the Student Success Act, Congress will still have to wade through difficult negotiations in conference to bridge differences between the two proposals.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress is debating an update of the No Child Left Behind Act, which poured an avalanche of federal programs and testing standards on public schools.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Congress is debating an update of the No Child Left Behind Act, which poured an avalanche of federal programs and testing standards on public schools.", "title": "Congress Considers No Child Left Behind Rewrites", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150706_NCLB_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-06T20:11:30+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1gk08qv"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Congress is debating an update of the No Child Left Behind Act, which poured an avalanche of federal programs and testing standards on public schools.", "title": "Congress Considers No Child Left Behind Rewrites", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150706_NCLB_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12", "published_time": "2015-07-06T17:36:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-06T20:11:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "No Child Left Behind, Student Success Act, Every Child Achieves Act, Mark Walker, Ron DeSantis, John Kline"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb9ab\"", "article_summary": "Though the Senate proposal increases states\u2019 flexibility in assessing performance, the bill would maintain the rigid testing standards under No Child Left Behind.\nThe Senate\u2019s version of the Student Success Act, called the Every Child Achieves Act, stripped out the portability measure to garner enough support from Democrats.\nThis amendment would allow states to opt out of the nearly 80 federal programs under No Child Left Behind, giving them the option to direct federal education funding toward state-established programs instead.\nThe No Child Left Behind rewrite was pulled from the House floor in February after conservatives argued it did not go far enough in removing the federal government from education policy.\nEight years after the program technically expired, Congress is finally debating an update of the contentious No Child Left Behind Act, which poured an avalanche of federal programs and testing standards on public schools across the U.S."}
