That's why we've started this new feature on News9.com.\n\nFirst up, we want you to get to know Lacie Lowry. Lacie is a reporter for News 9 and co-anchors News 9 at 4 p.m. Monday through Friday with Robin Marsh.\n\n1. What was your first job in television?\n\nMy first job in television news was a weekend reporter in Abilene, Texas, at the ABC affiliate. It was market #165 and I worked my way up from weekend reporter to weeknight anchor. Bless those viewers for all the mistakes they let me get away with.\n\n2. You have 15 minutes of free time, what do you do?\n\nI try to watch one of my homicide detective shows and since I\u2019m a chronic procrastinator, I\u2019d watch 20 minutes of it before doing whatever else I was supposed to do next.\n\n3. What\u2019s in the console of your car?\n\nNAPKINS!!! I spill food or drinks on myself all the time and so I am a napkin hoarder. Open up the console and napkins burst out like biscuits in a canister. Also, I have some mixed tapes that I can\u2019t seem to let go of, even though my car has no tape player.\n\n4. What\u2019s your hidden talent?\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard my singing on News 9 at 4pm, so that\u2019s no longer a hidden talent. However, most people don\u2019t know I\u2019m a pretty good athlete. I\u2019ve played sports all my life and I\u2019m down for a softball or volleyball game anytime.\n\n5. What was your high school mascot?\n\nI grew up in Rockwall, Texas, just east of Dallas and our mascot is the Yellow Jackets and our colors were orange!\n\n6. How would you describe Oklahoma City to someone who\u2019s never been here?\n\nOKC has a little something for everyone in different pockets all over town. It\u2019s easy to find your niche and it\u2019s easy to try something new. It\u2019s a metro area with a great mix of stuff to do and foodies love it.\n\n7. What is the most exciting thing to ever happen to you?\n\nI have a lot of milestones in life I haven\u2019t reached yet, but so far, the most exciting thing to ever happen to me is becoming an aunt. I didn\u2019t know I could love someone so much, but my two nephews have revealed to me that wonderful God-given gift and I\u2019m truly grateful for it.\n\n8. Do you remember your very first pet? What was it and what was its name?\n\nMy first pet was a sheltie dog named Penny and she was almost identical to Lassie. I shoved my hand in her food bowl as a child and she bit my eye \u2013 leaving a scar that forever reminded me to obey my parents when they told me NOT to do something!\n\n9. What are your guilty pleasures?\n\nMovies, crossword puzzles and bad puns. I\u2019m truly a sucker for a corny quip \u2013 I think they\u2019re so\u2026.punny. (See what I did there?)\n\nFollow Lacie Lowry on Facebook and Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "We thought you'd like to know more about the members of the News 9 team who bring you the news that happens in Oklahoma every day.
