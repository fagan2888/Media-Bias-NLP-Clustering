The medical examiner's office has positively identified the body, discovered near Meeker on Wednesday, as that of 27-year-old Marshall Dent.

According to the ME's report, Dent was killed by blunt force trauma to the head and neck. The manner of death is now officially homicide.

Dent's mother, Pam, tells News 9 she last saw Marshall on Dec. 23. Pam says she grew even more concerned when she found out her son had left their Shawnee home with 36-year-old George E. Walker.

Walker is a convicted felon. In 1994 he was convicted of first-degree manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years in prison for stabbing and killing a man. He was released in 2005, but went back to prison two more times for assault and battery.
