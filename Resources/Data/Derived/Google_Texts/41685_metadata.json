Republican Rep. Cory Gardner of the state\u2019s 4th U.S. House district is facing incumbent Sen. Mark Udall, a Democrat. CBS4 will publish a profile of Udall on Wednesday. Profiles of the candidates in the governor race will run next week.\n\nDENVER (CBS4) \u2013 In a state balanced among Democrats, Republicans and independents, Cory Gardner has necessarily taken a tack to the state\u2019s center.\n\nThe congressman from Colorado\u2019s 4th U.S. House district, a primarily conservative one, has tried eschewing some of his party\u2019s more partisan positions on climate change, personhood amendments and immigration; he would much rather talk about the economy, foreign affairs and his opposition to Obamacare.\n\nTo claim more centrist ground on those issues, Gardner\u2019s campaign is billing him as a \u201cnew kind of Republican.\u201d\n\nHis remarks on a federal \u201cLife at Conception Act,\u201d which he co-sponsored, are brief: \u201cIt\u2019s a statement that I support life.\u201d Attempts to get him to elaborate are met with a comparably truncated answer. He often turns the tables on his opponent, Sen. Mark Udall, for the Democrat\u2019s relentless focus on Gardner\u2019s social stances, calling Udall a \u201csocial issues warrior.\u201d\n\nGardner similarly doesn\u2019t like addressing climate change. At a debate on Oct. 1, Gardner refused to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d on whether he believes humans are the primary cause.\n\n\u201cI believe climate is changing,\u201d he said in a recent interview with CBS4, but he added he doesn\u2019t want the country to pursue policies that would damage the economy for the environment\u2019s benefit.\n\nBut the environmental question does provide Gardner with a pivot to the economy: He says more than 200 bills with strong bipartisan support have passed the House that the Senate won\u2019t consider.\n\n\u201c(They\u2019re) ideas that could grow our economy, ideas that could secure better opportunities and they aren\u2019t even brought up for a vote. The Senate failed for five years to pass a budget. That\u2019s one of the requirements of a Senate to do.\u201d\n\nSince 2010, Gardner has represented most of Colorado\u2019s eastern plains in a district that Mitt Romney won by 19 percentage points in 2012. That President Barack Obama captured the state by 5.4 percentage points explains Gardner\u2019s maneuvering and describes the daunting task he has assumed. He\u2019s not running for re-election in the 4th where he would have easily won.\n\nSo he\u2019s tried broadening his appeal statewide.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve gone around the state over the last several months, talking about our four corners plan: This is a plan focusing on the economy, energy, education and the environment,\u201d he said.\n\nHe often says in advertisements and in speeches that he wants to \u201cshake things up\u201d in the U.S. Senate,\n\n\u201cto get things done, to put forward a positive agenda for this country.\u201d\n\nAffordable Care Act Opposition, Economy Central To Gardner\u2019s Hopes\n\nGardner\u2019s economic plan is at his campaign\u2019s heart.\n\nHe attacks Udall for statistics that say Colorado\u2019s recovery isn\u2019t as rosy as the incumbent believes.\n\n\u201cIf you look at what\u2019s happening around Colorado over past several years, median household income has declined by over $4,000,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cThe number of hours that families are working is declining because of Obamacare. The American people, the people of Colorado are working harder than they ever have, and they\u2019re finding opportunities more and more difficult to reach.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, he says, prices on college tuition, food and gas have risen while Udall\u2019s been in office.\n\nGardner supports expanding the earned income tax credit that he says will lift more lower-income Americans out of poverty.\n\nHe opposes raising the federal minimum wage and instead supports state control over wages, like Colorado\u2019s annual tracking that\u2019s based on a consumer price index.\n\n\u201cWashington, D.C., shouldn\u2019t be dictating to Burlington, Colo., what to do,\u201d Gardner said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was a primary reason why Gardner launched a bid for the Senate. He\u2019s voted to repeal the act several dozen times, claiming that its economic impact is devastating.\n\n\u201cI believe that we can do better,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe we can put in its place ideas that will actually work to lower the cost of care and increase the quality of care.\u201d\n\nHe says there is bipartisan support to eliminate the medical device costs and the independent payment advisory board.\n\n\u201cThere are ways we can work together,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is unsustainable.\u201d\n\nClimate Change Measures Can\u2019t Imperil Economy\n\nGardner has said repeatedly he won\u2019t jeopardize the country\u2019s economy for harsh environmental measures that punish companies.\n\n\u201cI am not willing to pursue devastating economic policies,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said he isn\u2019t sure how much humans affect the climate.\n\n\u201cThere are differences to the extent that is happening,\u201d he said.\n\nHe has supported domestic-energy projects like the proposed phase of the Keystone XL pipeline that would transport oil from Canada through western U.S. states. Opponents say the environmental impacts could be severe, but Gardner says the project ensures thousands of jobs that pay $20 to $30 an hour.\n\nGardner, who sits on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, has also sponsored legislation that seeks energy-efficiency in government operations.\n\n\u201cI think we ought to work and do everything we can to improve our environment. We have an obligation to make sure we have a cleaner environment for the next generation. That\u2019s why I supported energy-efficient legislation, making sure we can make our federal buildings more energy-efficient.\u201d\n\nImmigration Reform Begins With Border Security\n\nIllegal immigration has also drawn Gardner closer to Colorado\u2019s political center. The representative said he supports a wide-ranging agenda that features border security at its core.\n\n\u201cWe need immigration reform. The Senate bill isn\u2019t the only idea out there. The Senate doesn\u2019t have monopoly on good ideas,\u201d Gardner said, referencing a 2013 bipartisan bill passed by the Senate but not voted on by the House.\n\nHe said the Senate bill would stop as little as a third of the undocumented immigration into the country.\n\n\u201cWe should start with border security, yes, but border security in and of itself isn\u2019t enough,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to have a guest worker program, fix the entry-exit system, fix the e-verify system and make the system work so that 30 years from now, we can look back at 2014 and say, \u201cWhat they did then still works today.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGardner hasn\u2019t said whether he supports a path to citizenship but said he wouldn\u2019t back deporting the tens of millions of illegal immigrants already in the United States.\n\n\u201cI think some kind of an earned status is certainly something this country will move toward, but we have to make sure that we start with a secure border, start with a guest worker program,\u201d he said. \u201cPut those in place to give the American people the confidence that we can carry this forward in a responsible manner.\u201d\n\nMore Campaign 2014 Stories", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a state balanced among Democrats, Republicans and independents, Cory Gardner has necessarily taken a tack to the state's center.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://denver.cbslocal.com/2014/10/14/gardner-hoping-new-kind-of-republican-message-broadens-appeal/", "image": {"width": 1440, "secure_url": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/cory-gardner-tm-raw_frame_3066.png?w=1440", "identifier": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/cory-gardner-tm-raw_frame_3066.png?w=1440", "height": 810}, "type": "article", "description": "In a state balanced among Democrats, Republicans and independents, Cory Gardner has necessarily taken a tack to the state's center.", "title": "Gardner Hoping 'New Kind Of Republican' Message Broadens Appeal"}, "twitter": {"site": "/social/", "image": "https://cbsdenver.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/cory-gardner-tm-raw_frame_3066.png?w=1440", "description": "In a state balanced among Democrats, Republicans and independents, Cory Gardner has necessarily taken a tack to the state's center.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Gardner Hoping 'New Kind Of Republican' Message Broadens Appeal"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "CBSDenver.com in Denver is Colorado's Online News Channel with up to the minute breaking news, weather, sports and top spots.", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Denver", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsdenver", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsdenver"}, "keywords": "local, news, politics, shaun boyd, syndicated local, affordable care act, campaign 2014, campaign 2014 candidate profiles, climate change, cory gardner, economy, house committee on energy and commerce, keystone xl pipeline, life at conception act, mark udall, mitt romney, obamacare, personhood", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://denver.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1358cb67b88b4ef2e59895070c511d70?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, campaign 2014, campaign 2014 candidate profiles, climate change, cory gardner, economy, house committee on energy and commerce, keystone xl pipeline, life at conception act, mark udall, mitt romney, obamacare, personhood"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1bc4\"", "article_summary": "Gardner supports expanding the earned income tax credit that he says will lift more lower-income Americans out of poverty.\nRepublican Rep.
