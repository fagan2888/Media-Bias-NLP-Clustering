But turn the clock back on what built the middle class. Going back as far as they could, and I saw it. I spoke out against it. I gave speeches on the Senate floor and every other place I could get. Basically, making the argument don\u2019t let them go back to trickle down economics. Don\u2019t let them impose their failed economic policies on us again. Don\u2019t let them turn their backs on what works in America.\u201d\n\nIn a separate statement former Sec. of State Clinton added:\n\nAmerica\u2019s workers are the backbone of our economy. Working men and women forged the basic bargain that made this country great \u2013 that if you work hard and do your part, you can get ahead and stay ahead. This Labor Day, we celebrate all the workers who built America from the ground up.\n\nBut as we celebrate, we also rededicate ourselves to making sure that basic bargain lasts. It\u2019s under attack from Republicans who want to cut taxes for the wealthy and let corporations write their own rules. They don\u2019t want to strengthen workers\u2019 rights; they want to undermine them. We can\u2019t let that happen.\n\nI have fought for working families my entire career. In the Senate, I was an original co-sponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act. As President, I will fight to increase the minimum wage and get wages rising again for all American workers. Right now, CEO pay and corporate profits are through the roof but middle-class incomes have barely budged. That\u2019s not the way it\u2019s supposed to work in America.\n\nI\u2019ll also fight for investments in infrastructure and high-tech manufacturing, to create more good-paying jobs. I\u2019ll invest in America\u2019s future workforce, by making sure every child can go to a high-quality preschool, costs won\u2019t be a barrier to college, and student debt won\u2019t hold anyone back. And I\u2019ll expand apprenticeship programs, so more companies invest in hiring and training new workers.\n\nNone of this will come easily. But we Americans aren\u2019t afraid of hard work. This Labor Day, we celebrate advances that took a lot of patient, persistent effort \u2013 like the 40-hour workweek, overtime protections, workplace safety rules, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act. They all took sacrifice and courage on the part of American workers, from the factory floor to the emergency room to the construction crane. And thanks to them, our country became a better, fairer place.\n\nI will always stand with workers. I\u2019ll always champion their right to organize. And I\u2019ll always fight efforts to roll back union collective bargaining rights. Because when workers are strong, and working families are strong, America is strong.\n\nThe basic bargain in this country has always been that hard work creates opportunities for success, but American workers are working harder than ever before and are being cheated out of their share of the rewards that come from success.\n\nAs Clinton pointed out, Republicans have gone from opposing anything that they view as expanding workers\u2019 rights to actively trying to undermine the rights of American workers. The Democratic nominee must vow to fight against the interests that are bankrolling the Republican agenda against workers.\n\nFormer Sec. Clinton hit the nail on the head. The next battle will be centered on increasing wages for the nation\u2019s workers. Democrats must lead this unified fight because Republicans have the billionaire\u2019s money. It will take a united Democratic front to move this nation forward.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took aim at Republicans for destroying economic opportunity for workers by undermining the basic American bargain that hard work is rewarded with success.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took aim at Republicans for destroying economic opportunity for workers by undermining the basic American bargain that hard work is rewarded with success.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Slams Republicans For Attacking The Bargain That Is The Backbone of America", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/09/07/hillary-clinton-slams-republicans-attacking-bargain-backbone-america.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/hillary-clinton-labor-day-chicago.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-07T16:49:03+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Hillary Clinton,Chicago,hillary clinton fights for workers,Labor Day,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Hillary Clinton", "published_time": "2015-09-07T16:49:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-07T16:49:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Chicago, Hillary Clinton, hillary clinton fights for workers, Labor Day"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2289\"", "article_summary": "Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton took aim at Republicans for destroying economic opportunity for workers by undermining the basic American bargain that hard work is rewarded with success.\nAs Clinton pointed out, Republicans have gone from opposing anything that they view as expanding workers\u2019 rights to actively trying to undermine the rights of American workers.\nThey all took sacrifice and courage on the part of American workers, from the factory floor to the emergency room to the construction crane.\nThey don\u2019t want to strengthen workers\u2019 rights; they want to undermine them.\nAs President, I will fight to increase the minimum wage and get wages rising again for all American workers."}
