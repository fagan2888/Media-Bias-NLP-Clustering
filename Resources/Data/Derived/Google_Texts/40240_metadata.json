HMSA will stop offering plans to small businesses beginning January 2015. The companies will be able to finish the terms of their enrollment over the next few months, and then they can either enroll in plans directly through HMSA or choose a different plan on the exchange, likely from the only other insurer, Kaiser Permanente, Gold said.\n\nThat represents about half the Hawaii businesses purchasing insurance plans through the Connector, state Sen. Rosalyn Baker said.\n\n\u201cThey really are dissing small businesses, and I\u2019m appalled by that,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThey don\u2019t think about the impact. They\u2019re so used to having their way.\u201d\n\nTom Matsuda, interim director of the Hawaii Health Connector, said he was disappointed that HMSA decided to pull out of the small business exchange after less than a year.\n\nThe small business exchange \u201cprovides the only opportunity for small businesses to get tax credits that reduce the cost of insurance for their employees by up to 50 percent,\u201d Matsuda said in an emailed statement. \u201cI am especially concerned about small business owners who have already qualified for the tax credits by purchasing HMSA plans through the Connector. We will do our best to help those employers.\u201d\n\nSmall businesses have to buy insurance plans through the Connector to qualify for those tax credits, said Lindsay Chambers, spokeswoman for Hawaii\u2019s Insurance Commissioner Gordon Ito, in an email.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to seek other ways to ensure that Hawaii\u2019s small businesses are able to obtain these tax credits in accordance with federal law,\u201d Chambers said.\n\nGold said very few employers qualify for the tax credits.\n\nMatsuda will work with other insurers that may want to offer plans on the exchange, he said.\n\nThe Hawaii Health Connector has been plagued with problems from its inception. Its open-enrollment period was delayed because of technical problems. Then it enrolled just 10,800 people and earned just $40,350 in its first six months, far below the $320,000 it expected. It was awarded more than $200 million in federal grants, but it couldn\u2019t get by without a $1.5 million appropriation from the Legislature. Now, Connector officials are working on reducing expenses.\n\nWhile the company is pulling out of the small business side, HMSA will continue to sell plans through the Connector on the individual side, where it has nearly 5,000 customers, Gold said.\n\nMany employers already provide insurance to most employees because of the state\u2019s Prepaid Health Care Act, which mandates coverage for workers who clock more than 20 hours per week.\n\nBut HMSA staff logged 8,000 hours dealing with problems such as data from 133 patient accounts that disappeared when it was sent from the Connector to HMSA, Gold said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an astonishing number of hours we\u2019ve spent on this,\u201d Gold said. \u201cThe system still is not really working correctly.\u201d\n\nEric Alborg, deputy director of the Connector, said it\u2019s unfortunate that HMSA is focusing on problems and drawing attention away from the fact that \u201cthey are denying their customers tax credits.\u201d But it is true that on both sides there was a lot of time spent on fixing issues with both systems, Alborg said.\n\nHMSA reported year-to-date loss of $8.4 million Thursday. It blamed its $30 million first-quarter loss on the Affordable Care Act and said it made up some of that loss in the second quarter.\n\n___\n\nCathy Bussewitz can be reached on Twitter at http://twitter.com/cbussewitz", "article_metadata": {"description": "HONOLULU (AP) \u2014 Hawaii's largest health insurer is pulling out of the small-business side of the state's troubled health exchange, leaving the Hawaii Health Connector with only one insurance company for employers to select.
