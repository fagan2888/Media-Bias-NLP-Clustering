Murray had lost twice previously to Djokovic in 2011 and 2013 and to Roger Federer in 2010.\n\nThe No. 1-ranked Djokovic, meanwhile, is a perfect 5-for-5 in Australian Open finals.\n\nDjokovic swung momentum in a close match with a service break in the eighth game of the third set, winning four straight points. When he took a 4-0 lead in the last set, he smacked his fist hard against his chest in celebration.\n\nAt the end of the match, Djokovic threw his racket into the crowd at Rod Laver Arena.\n\nRoy Emerson, the only other man with five or more Australian titles, was in the crowd and Djokovic acknowledged the presence of the six-time champion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so grateful to be standing here as a champion for the fifth time, and to be in the elite group of players \u2014 Roy Emerson, Rod Laver and all the legends of our sport,\u201d Djokovic said.\n\nMurray sat slumped over in his chair after the match, awaiting the presentations, and once again received the runner-up plate instead of the trophy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been my most consistent Grand Slam of my career. I haven\u2019t been quite able to win, but the support I\u2019ve received here has been amazing,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI\u2019ll try and come back next year and hopefully have a slightly different outcome in the final.\u201d\n\nMurray said he had chances to win the match.\n\n\u201cObviously I had opportunities in the first three sets,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIn the fourth set, I mean, he was just ripping everything. Returns he was hitting on the baseline. Once he got up a break, he just loosened up and was just going for his shots. I couldn\u2019t recover.\n\n\u201cNovak has won five times here now, there\u2019s no disgrace, obviously, in losing to him.\u201d\n\nDjokovic appeared to be troubled by a leg ailment in the third set, and it distracted Murray.\n\n\u201cI just had weakness, I couldn\u2019t call for medical because I had no reason,\u201d Djokovic said.\n\nDjokovic served for the first set after breaking Murray in the eighth game, but Murray broke back. After that game, Djokovic had a trainer attend to this right thumb.\n\nHe double-faulted to open the tiebreaker but then, after Murray took a 2-1 lead, won five of the next six points to regain control. He clinched the set when Murray netted a backhand service return.\n\nIn the second set, Djokovic saved a set point in the 10th game and Murray saved three break points in the 11th before it went to the tiebreaker. Sixth-seeded Murray dominated the breaker to lead 6-2, securing four set points before clinching it on Djokovic\u2019s serve.\n\nThe second set was delayed for about five minutes after the seventh game when a court invader protesting Australia\u2019s refugee policies was removed by security after stepping on to the court. Other spectators in the stadium unfurled a political banner. Organizers said two people were arrested, and the court invasion was dealt with swiftly.\n\nThere was a bigger cheer for Djokovic when the introductions were made, but plenty of Scottish flags in the stands. Some Serbian fans yelled \u201cAdje Nole\u201d \u2014 Serbian for \u201cCome on Nole,\u201d which is Djokovic\u2019s nickname.\n\nBefore the match began, Andy Murray\u2019s fiancee, Kim Sears, caused a stir. She was dressed in an oversized T-shirt with a message that poked fun at the widespread attention paid to her use of colorful language during Murray\u2019s semifinal win over Tomas Berdych.\n\nRather than shy away from the issue, Sears\u2019 T-shirt for the final showed a sense of humor.
