G.I. Jobs released the 2014 Top 10 Hot Degrees for Veterans on Monday, with business administration being the first degree program listed.

The list was created by surveying hiring managers from a group of 200 “Military Friendly Employers” to pinpoint the degrees that help veterans land in-demand jobs in fields that are hiring.

Sean Collins, a nine-year Navy veteran and publisher of G.I. Jobs said in a press release that education should open doors to a good career for veterans.

“Our Military Friendly Employers hired over 180,000 veterans within the last year, proof that military experience, plus the right degree, make veterans highly desirable employees,” Collins said.

The Top 10 Hot Degrees for Veterans includes Bachelor’s degree programs in business administration, engineering, healthcare, information technology and operations and logistics.

The list also included two-year degree and certificate options in commercial driving, information technology, mechanics, healthcare and technician licenses.

All of the fields of study from the 2014 Top 10 Hot Degrees for Veterans list offer the educational background necessary to start a career in one of the 2014 Top 20 Hot Jobs for Veterans, a list that G.I. Jobs published in March.

Several finance and business administration careers were included on the 2014 Top 20 Hot Jobs for Veterans list, including operations manager, business administrator, financial services professional, construction project manager and human resources manager.

The business administration section of the 2014 Top 10 Hot Degrees for Veterans list also includes information about degrees in finance and accounting.
