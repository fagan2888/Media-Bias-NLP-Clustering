(AP) - Receiver Randall Cobb has left the Packers\u2019 preseason game Saturday night against the Philadelphia Eagles with a shoulder injury.\n\nCobb appeared to be favoring his right arm after landing on the arm as he was trying to catch a pass on the sideline from rookie Brett Hundley on Green Bay\u2019s first offensive drive.\n\nHe is the second starting wideout to get hurt for Green Bay in preseason action. Jordy Nelson was lost for the year with a right knee injury last Sunday against Pittsburgh.\n\nCobb signed a four-year, $40 million contract in the offseason that kept the receiver off the open market. He is expected to be the Packers\u2019 top wideout with Nelson gone.\n\nHundley started in place of NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers, who watched from the sideline in sweats as a healthy scratch. The Packers did not dress three starting offensive linemen because of injuries.\n\nRight tackle Bryan Bulaga then left this game later in the first quarter with a left ankle injury, leaving center Corey Linsley as the only healthy starting lineman.\n\nFor the Eagles, starting right tackle Lane Johnson limped off with a left knee injury following a failed 2-point conversion attempt in the first quarter. The team said it was keeping Johnson out the rest of the game as a precaution.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "Receiver Randall Cobb has left the Packers' preseason game Saturday night against the Philadelphia Eagles with a shoulder injury.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Receiver Randall Cobb has left the Packers\u2019 preseason game Saturday night against the Philadelphia Eagles with a shoulder injury.", "title": "Packers\u2019 Randall Cobb leaves game with shoulder injury", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/29/packers-randall-cobb-leaves-game-with-shoulder-inj/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/29/745c2c0ff2378826800f6a7067009d24.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/29/745c2c0ff2378826800f6a7067009d24.jpg", "description": "Receiver Randall Cobb has left the Packers' preseason game Saturday night against the Philadelphia Eagles with a shoulder injury.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Packers\u2019 Randall Cobb leaves game with shoulder injury"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9516\"", "article_summary": "GREEN BAY, Wis.
