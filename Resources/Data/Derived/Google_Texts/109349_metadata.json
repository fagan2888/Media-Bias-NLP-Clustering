Some of the key changes being proposed even by Democrats include bills to delay the individual mandate penalty payments as well as legislation to grandfather in individual's old insurance plans that likely would get cancelled in the reformed system.\n\nThe bill to grandfather in existing health care plans that don't meet ACA standards \u2014 proposed by Sen. Mary L. Landrieu, D-La. \u2014 has been picking up a little steam among Democrats in recent days, with Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Jeff Merkley of Oregon announcing their support this week. The measure is aimed at making good on Obama's promise that people who liked their existing health insurance plans could keep them under the Obamacare law. That has turned out to not be true for millions of Americans.\n\nOn Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president shares the goal of the Landrieu bill, but he stopped short of endorsing it.\n\n\"We're going to work with her and work with others,\" Carney said.\n\nSteven T.
