John Heinz History Center in the Strip District.\n\nCEOs for Cities is a nonprofit that connects community leaders across the country through workshops and competitions. About 275 participants from 40 cities attended the three-day Pittsburgh workshop that began Wednesday and focused on strategies for fostering economic inclusion.\n\nAccording to a report published by the Washington, D.C.-based Urban Institute in 2014, Pittsburgh\u2019s poverty rate increased from 10.3 percent in 2000 to 12.8 percent in 2012. More than three-quarters of those living below the poverty line consist of African-American, Hispanic or Asian minorities.\n\nSome community leaders at the session Thursday openly admitted to not being able to figure out how to stimulate both economic growth and economic inclusion. Brad Whitehead, president of the Cleveland nonprofit Fund for Our Economic Future, said that sometimes the areas with the largest job growth also can be the areas with the greatest increases in poverty and crime.\n\nErin Flynn, associate vice president for strategic partnerships at Portland State University, said one of the biggest challenges is making economic inclusivity systemic. She noted the investment required is often a 10- to 20-year commitment, which is longer than the time most politicians and bureaucrats spend in office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard game and a long game,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been in this game long enough, you can see that we\u2019ve been working on these issues for a long time.\u201d\n\nValerie Patton, executive director of the St. Louis Business Diversity Initiative, said the riots in Ferguson and St. Louis propelled her city to look further into the barriers preventing economic mobility.\n\nThose barriers aren\u2019t just racial or cultural \u2014 often they are physical.\n\nMs. Patton described the Delmar Divide, named for Delmar Boulevard, a major four-lane highway that runs east-west through St. Louis. The south side is majority white with well-kept homes and an $80,000 median income. To the north, there\u2019s entrenched poverty \u2014 and the neighborhood is 99 percent black.\n\nCity advocates and investors hoping to chisel at the barrier are focusing resources on that divide, starting with LaunchCode, a St. Louis nonprofit founded in 2013 that sets up paid technology apprenticeships at businesses across the city. More than 90 percent of apprentices in the program have found full-time employment.\n\nLaunchCode is also renovating a new community center on Delmar Boulevard, with plans to open in 2016.\n\nDespite the challenges, participants in Thursday\u2019s session did offer strategies. Mr. Whitehead mentioned using philanthropy to stimulate economic inclusion and searching for qualified people for jobs that don\u2019t require academic credentials.\n\nMr. Generett described his organization\u2019s internship program, which gives local college students the opportunity to work at sci-tech companies in the Pittsburgh area. More than 400 interns have gone through the program \u2014 40 percent are African-American, 60 percent are women and 50 percent are first-generation college students.\n\n\u201cThis is work is not popular,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not sexy. It\u2019s not fun. There\u2019s no silver bullet.\u201d\n\nEddy Wang: cwang@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1969.", "article_metadata": {"description": "About 275 participants from 40 cities attended the three-day\u00a0CEOs for Cities workshop held at the Heinz History Center.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "You don\u2019t have to look any further than Baltimore and Ferguson, Mo., to see what happens when broad segments of the population feel marginalized, brutalized and left behind. \u201cBaltimore \u2014 that can happen in every single city,\u201d said Bill Generett, CEO of Urban Innovation21, a public-private Hill District tech center.
