The LDDA (Longmont Downtown Development Authority) was a huge help. And now that we're a designated arts district that helps too,\" she said. \"The hardest part was getting all the licensing, but finding the artists was not hard at all because there is so much local talent.\"\n\nThat local talent will also be teaching. Cardinal is planning courses and workshops starting in January. The first class will be on iPhone photography by Longmont's Maureen Ruddy Burkhart.\n\nThe official grand opening of the DARKROOM is Friday, Dec. 12. That's also when the gallery will kick-off its wine tasting series which will feature the Ciatano Winery out of Lyons. They will do a wine tasting on the second Friday of each month after that.\n\nFor gallery owner Cardinal, opening the DARKROOM is more than a business decision.\n\n\"The biggest thing for me is giving artists a place to show their work. I charge a much lower commission than other galleries,\" she pointed out. \"Yes this is a business, but I love making the artists happy, I love coming here every day and being able to sit here and look at all this art. I get to go out and find new artists. What could be better. I wake up every morning and I am so happy that I found this job that I am so passionate about.\"\n\nMore details at cardinal-photography.com/events\n\nVince Winkel: 303-684-5291, winkelv@times-call.com or twitter.com/vincewinkel", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/business/ci_27020534/darkroom-joins-longmonts-vibrant-local-arts-community", "sailthru.author": "By Vince Winkel \n \n  Times-Call staff writer", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27020534:view"}, "startDate": "2014-11-28T13:38:58-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Fine arts will score another foothold in Longmont this Saturday, when the DARKROOM on Main St. opens its doors for the first time.", "title": "The DARKROOM joins Longmont's vibrant local arts community (audio)", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/business/ci_27020534/darkroom-joins-longmonts-vibrant-local-arts-community", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1126/20141126__28TCAartw~4.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Business", "modificationDate": "2015-02-05T11:08:09-0700", "endDate": "2024-11-28T13:38:58-0700", "news_keywords": "news, arts, darkroom, Longmont, winkel", "byline": "By Vince WinkelTimes-Call", "pubDate": "2014-11-26T18:44:23-0700", "sailthru.date": "2014-11-28T13:38:58-0700", "sailthru.title": "The DARKROOM joins Longmont's vibrant local arts community (audio)", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1126/20141126__28TCAartw~4_300.jpg", "description": "Fine arts will score another foothold in Longmont this Saturday, when the DARKROOM on Main St. opens its doors for the first time.", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "sailthru.tags": "news, arts, darkroom, Longmont, winkel", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/business/ci_27020534/darkroom-joins-longmonts-vibrant-local-arts-community", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1126/20141126__28TCAartw~4.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Fine arts will score another foothold in Longmont this Saturday, when the DARKROOM on Main St. opens its doors for the first time.", "title": "The DARKROOM joins Longmont's vibrant local arts community (audio)"}, "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2014/1126/20141126__28TCAartw~4.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ed6\"", "article_summary": "Cardinal says Longmont's growing, vibrant arts community made opening a gallery fairly painless.\nThere are 17 other studios, galleries or art spaces in downtown Longmont, according to McKee.\nFor gallery owner Cardinal, opening the DARKROOM is more than a business decision.\nThe LDDA (Longmont Downtown Development Authority) was a huge help.\nOn Saturday, the gallery will exhibit the work of 10 local artists: Cardinal, Maureen Ruddy Burkhart, Suzanne Frazier, Brenda Ferrimani, Doug Fields, Paula Peacock, Susan Helen Strok, Tammy Helart, Joan Jordan and Chichi Ledesma."}
