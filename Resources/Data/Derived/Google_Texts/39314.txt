The former owner of a chiropractic clinic has been indicted for the murder of his fifth wife.

U.S. Marshals officials say their regional fugitive task force arrested Michael Wohlschlaeger, of Pensacola, last month in connection with his wife's 2010 death.

Authorities say Wohlschlaeger killed his fifth wife, 59-year-old Shirley Seitz. The Panama City News Herald reports an autopsy revealed Seitz's died from blunt force trauma to the head.

But Wohlschlaeger maintains his innocence and says Seitz died after falling down the stairs of their Baldwin County, Alabama home.

If convicted, Wohlschlaeger could face the death penalty or life in prison without parole.

The paper reports Wohlschlaeger was also found guilty of arson in the 1990s in connection with a blaze at his Chipley chiropractic office.
