In-patient hospital visits dropped by about ten per cent\u2014and physicians reduced the mad amounts of home-health-care spending by nearly forty per cent. McAllen\u2019s spending on ambulance rides\u2014previously the highest in the country\u2014dropped by almost forty per cent, too.\n\nMost startling of all, McAllen has been changing its ways. Between 2009 and 2012, its costs dropped almost three thousand dollars per Medicare recipient. Skinner projects the total savings to taxpayers to have reached almost half a billion dollars by the end of 2014. The hope of reform had been to simply \u201cbend the curve.\u201d This was savings on an unprecedented scale.\n\nGawalde followed up with Lester Dyke, a cardiologist who now practices at Rio Grande Regional Hospital. Before, he was at Doctors Hospital at Renaissance in Edinburg:\n\nI followed up with doctors there to find out how this had happened. I started with Lester Dyke, a cardiac surgeon who was one of many doctors troubled by what they were seeing, but the only one to let me quote him by name in my McAllen piece. (\u201cMedicine has become a pig trough here,\u201d he had told me. \u201cWe took a wrong turn when doctors stopped being doctors and became businessmen.\u201d) After it was published, television crews descended on the town. Texas newspapers did follow-up investigations.\n\n\u201cThe reaction here was fierce, just a tremendous amount of finger-pointing and yelling and screaming,\u201d Dyke recently told me. The piece infuriated the local medical community, which felt unfairly singled out. And Dyke paid a steep price: \u201cI became persona non grata overnight.\u201d Colleagues said that he would be to blame if they lost money. Cardiologists stopped sending him patients. \u201cMy cases went down by ninety per cent,\u201d he told me. He had to give up his practice at Doctors Hospital at Renaissance, the for-profit hospital, after it became clear that he wasn\u2019t welcome there, but he was able to continue doing some surgery at two other hospitals. When I talked to Dyke in the first months afterward, he\u2019d sounded low. The few friends who voiced support didn\u2019t want to be seen in public with him. He thought he might be forced to retire.\n\nYet he insisted that he had no regrets. Two of his children went into medicine, and in a medical-ethics class his son was assigned the article. The professor asked whether he was related to the Dr. Dyke quoted in it.\n\n\u201cYes, I am,\u201d he said proudly. \u201cThat\u2019s my crazy dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you often get a chance in life to stand up to all the badness,\u201d Dyke told me.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Monitor", "description": "Most people in the Rio Grande Valley remember The New Yorker magazine's pivotal 2009 article, \"The Cost Conundrum,\" about McAllen's typical Medicare costs per patient being higher than any other city in the country.", "title": "'The New Yorker' reported on McAllen's healthcare costs again.
