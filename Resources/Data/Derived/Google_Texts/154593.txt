In a smart segment on Reliable Sources Sunday morning, CNN media reporter Brian Stelter asked if the press corps was pushing military action against ISIS, noting that a media once concerned about its complicity in the run up to the 2003 Iraq War was now out in front of it.

Pointing to Geraldo Rivera’s tweet calling for the U.S. to “behead the ISIS butchers” and Fox News anchor Heather Childers adventures with CAPS LOCK, Stelter asked, “I have to wonder if some of these anchors, some of these commentators are letting their fears get the best of them, or their ideological agendas.”

“I myself am very concerned about the press provoking panic about ISIS, but I’m keeping an open mind,” Stelter said, a comment noticed by media watcher Jay Rosen:

…@brianstelter's trick for discarding the View from Nowhere. He'll say, "I'm worried about [gives his view] but I'm keeping an open mind." — Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) September 7, 2014
