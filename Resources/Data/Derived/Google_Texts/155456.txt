The deal between VHA and Chicago-based UHC, an alliance of nonprofit academic medical centers, will close at the end of March.

The combined organization will be headquartered in Irving, Texas, with an office in Chicago.

The company will serve more than 5,200 health system members and affiliates and more than 118,000 non-acute healthcare customers, according to a statement.

The combined organization will offer in-depth clinical data and supply chain data to address cost and quality, serving independent, community-based health care organizations as well as large, integrated systems and academic medical centers.

VHA president and CEO Curt Nonomaque has been named president and CEO of the new company.

“VHA was founded on the idea that health care organizations perform better and faster when working together,” Nonomaque said in a statement.
