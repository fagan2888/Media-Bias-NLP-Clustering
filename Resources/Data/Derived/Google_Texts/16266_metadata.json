The agency's finances are so difficult to pin down that the Congressional Budget Office was forced to rely on a report from 2004 to compile a report comparing Veterans Health Administration and private hospital healthcare costs, according to the article.\n\nAnother reform since McDonald took office has been the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act, which allowed veterans to seek care at private providers rather than endure long wait times. However, according to the article, some veterans groups have objected to this solution, arguing the VHA provides care veterans cannot get elsewhere. A November report found that despite the VA announcing it slashed wait times nearly 18 percent, more than 600,000 veterans face wait times of a month or longer.\n\nNor is the fallout from the initial scandal entirely over, according to the Daily Caller, which reports that VA staff \"scrub\" patients, or convince them to cancel scheduled appointments.\n\n\"The person who answers the phone might not even be the person's physician, but they'll just pull up the person's record and tell them they don't need the appointment,\" John P. Beavers, former nurse practitioner at Michigan's Battle Creek VA Medical Center, told the Daily Caller. \"But they won't take them off the schedule until the day or next day. That makes it look like the patient canceled.\"\n\nThese ongoing problems have landed the VA on the Government Accountability Office's annual list of the government agencies, programs and projects at highest risk for fraud, abuse and waste, according to the Fiscal Times.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the U.S. News article\n\n- read the Daily Caller article\n\n- here's the Fiscal Times article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nVA scandal: 600k vets still waiting a month for treatment\n\nVA audit: Many employees manipulated data under supervisors' orders\n\nVA scandal: McDonald announces major overhaul, firings\n\nVA scandal update: Wait times down 18 percent\n\nVA issues interim final rule for wait times fix\n\nEmails suggest bias in Phoenix VA probe, say critics\n\nOIG report: No evidence delays in care caused VA deaths\n\nHouse, Senate leaders deadlock on VA fix\n\nProcter & Gamble's McDonald vows to reaffirm VA values\n\nHouse approves bill that allows veterans to bypass VA for medical care\n\nAnticipated bill would improve VA wait times\n\nSecret VA wait list reveals 40 vets died while awaiting treatment\n\n18 more vets dead as legislators pen VA reform bill\n\nLawmakers call for resignation of Phoenix VA head over secret waitlist", "article_metadata": {"description": "Six months after Robert McDonald became the new Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the embattled agency has made progress, but still has much work remaining, according to U.S. News & World Report.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Six months after Robert McDonald became the new Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the embattled agency has made progress, but still has much work remaining, according to U.S. News & World Report.", "title": "VA scandal: Problems persist as McDonald's reforms take shape", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/va-scandal-problems-persist-mcdonalds-reforms-take-shape/2015-02-10", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Department of Veterans Affairs (VA),Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Robert McDonald,VA scandal,Veterans Health Administration (VHA),Wait Times", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca32a\"", "article_summary": "A November report found that despite the VA announcing it slashed wait times nearly 18 percent, more than 600,000 veterans face wait times of a month or longer.\nDespite these steps, critics of McDonald say the VA still needs to improve on transparency.\nNor is the fallout from the initial scandal entirely over, according to the Daily Caller, which reports that VA staff \"scrub\" patients, or convince them to cancel scheduled appointments.\nHowever, according to the article, some veterans groups have objected to this solution, arguing the VHA provides care veterans cannot get elsewhere.\nAnother reform since McDonald took office has been the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act, which allowed veterans to seek care at private providers rather than endure long wait times."}
