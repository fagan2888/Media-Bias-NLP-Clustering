DJ Ian Ali is no stranger to providing tunes to events for some big names, but two Super Bowl shindigs he was recently commissioned for may top them all.

Ali, who runs Jersey City-based Lifetime Entertainment, which he describes as a “full-service music entertainment and production company available for any special event or celebration,” will be bumping music for pre- and post-Super Bowl parties for the Denver Broncos tomorrow at the Hyatt Regency hotel, where the players have been staying this week.

The first will be a party for friends and families at noon. Then at 11 p.m., Ali will be deejaying what he hopes is a Super Bowl champion celebration.

Ali, 38, whose career began in his freshman year at McNair Academic High School in Jersey City, said he does 70 or more weddings a year — many at the Hyatt. In fact it was hotel representatives who recommended him to the Broncos.

“They love me at the Hyatt because I do a lot of weddings there,” he said. “They call me their favorite DJ.”

Hermes, the New Jersey Nets, Environmental Defense Fund, Al Gore, Sen. John McCain, Mark Ecko, and Walt Frazier have all been past clients of Ali’s, so he won’t be starstruck working with the Broncos. But the hype surrounding the Super Bowl makes the party unlike anything he’s been tasked with before.

Ali hopes tomorrow’s gigs will lead to even bigger and better things.

“I’m hoping it’s a stepping stone. I have quite a few established clients who are not as cool to publicize, but this is definitely a nice thing to promote,” he said.
