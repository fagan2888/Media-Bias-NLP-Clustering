The militaries for the two countries have had to make a concerted effort not to step on each other\u2019s toes, even though they have different targets, ISIS forces for the U.S. and other Syrian rebels for Russia.\n\nThe new ground conditions mean local ceasefires are possible, but \u201cmeaningful concessions\u201d among between Damascus, Western governments and rebels remain unlikely. In fact, a stabilized Syrian government would be better positioned to fight ISIS forces inside the country, meaning Washington and others should consider ditching their goal of getting rid of Assad and come around to Moscow\u2019s point of view that he should be left in place.\n\nIt\u2019s highly doubtful that the Obama administration would abandon its long-stated policy of finding a political solution to end the Syrian civil war, but given the involvement of ISIS, Russia and likely Tehran in the war after five years of conflict, there are few choices left.\n\nSpeaking in Istanbul this weekend, Vice President Biden signaled that Washington is considering a possible new direction.\n\nRelated: 14 Deadly Weapons Russia Has Sent To Syria\n\n\"We do know it would better if we can reach a political solution but we are prepared ... if that's not possible, to have a military solution to this operation in taking out Daesh,\" Biden said at a news conference after a meeting with Turkish leaders, using the Arabic acronym for the terror group.\n\nU.S. officials later clarified that he was referring to ISIS, not Syria as a whole, but at this point it doesn\u2019t seem possible to address one without addressing the other.\n\nMeanwhile, Syrian peace talks that were supposed to have started in Geneva on Monday have been delayed and could be cancelled altogether.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry said he hoped for \"clarity\" within 24 to 48 hours on whether the talks would occur at all.\n\nShould the latest round of peace talks fail to materialize, it likely would only give more credibility to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s approach of using military force to resolve the conflict, or at least diminish the chance of a political fix being found before President Obama leaves office next year.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "While Russia\u2019s military intervention in Syria has yielded little progress on the ground for the Assad government, Moscow has succeeded in propping up the embattle regime, according to a new analysis.", "title": "Has Putin Turned the Tide in Syria?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/25/Has-Putin-Turned-Tide-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/new-year-russia-putin_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/25/Has-Putin-Turned-Tide-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/new-year-russia-putin_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "While Russia\u2019s military intervention in Syria has yielded little progress on the ground for the Assad government, Moscow has succeeded in propping up the embattle regime, according to a new analysis.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Meanwhile, Syrian peace talks that were supposed to have started in Geneva on Monday have been delayed and could be cancelled altogether.\nU.S. officials later clarified that he was referring to ISIS, not Syria as a whole, but at this point it doesn\u2019t seem possible to address one without addressing the other.\nWhile Russia\u2019s military intervention in Syria has not yielded substantial progress on the ground for the Assad government, Moscow has succeeded in propping up the embattled regime, according to a new analysis.\nThe new ground conditions mean local ceasefires are possible, but \u201cmeaningful concessions\u201d among between Damascus, Western governments and rebels remain unlikely.\nSecretary of State John Kerry said he hoped for \"clarity\" within 24 to 48 hours on whether the talks would occur at all."}
