Mitt Romney appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Tuesday night, and did a cute bit in Kimmel's "Mean Tweets" series where he read a series of mean tweets from Donald Trump and other Trump supporters.

Kimmel then asked how much money he would be willing to pay Trump to drop out of the race, and Romney said that there's "not a right price" for that.
