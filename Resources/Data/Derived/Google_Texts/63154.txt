WASHINGTON — Rep. Pete Sessions’ big donors do not appear to be jumping ship to support a challenge from his right.

Despite words of encouragement from Sen. Ted Cruz and an endorsement from his father Rafael, only one of Katrina Pierson’s 19 largest donors previously donated to Sessions. Those 19 all gave $200 or more to her campaign and must be specifically identified according to election law. Sessions’ campaign had 319 donors give over $200.

Russell J. Ramsland donated $500 to Session’s 2010 reelection effort. But during this election cycle, he gave the federal maximum of $2,600 to the Pierson campaign.

“I didn’t leave Pete as much as Pete left me,” he said. “He’s been very clear to us that he represents John Boehner; he doesn’t really represent us.”

Ramsland said that Sessions abandoned his base by not strongly supporting attempts to defund the Affordable Care Act and not pushing for a special investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attacks. He referred to Sessions as a “big government guy.”

As for Pierson, Ramsland said that she has a “very solid grounding in the principles of free enterprise and limited government within its constitutional grounds.”

Pierson’s supporters hope that her campaign can mirror Cruz’s successful tea party-backed defeat of establishment conservative Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in the 2012 Republican primary for Senate. But in order to pull off that upset, Cruz entered the runoff with more cash on hand than Dewhurst and a modest, yet not insurmountable, gap in donations. Pierson is expected to receive an endorsement from the Tea Party Express this week.

Year-end campaign reports showed that Sessions, the chair of the powerful House Rules Committee, has 26 times more cash on hand than Pierson, about $1.3 million to $50,000.
