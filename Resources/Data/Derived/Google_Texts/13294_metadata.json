It\u2019s a trait I\u2019ve always envied about him. He\u2019s never down, no matter what he\u2019s facing, even before cancer. If he was having a bad day, it was hard to tell.\u201d\n\nA month ago, the 23-year-old MacIntosh appeared to be winning his year-long cancer battle. He was excited about rejoining the team this month, fully expecting to run outdoor track this spring.\n\nThe day after Christmas, his story took another tragic turn.\n\n\u201cKyle was feeling fantastic,\u201d said his father, Bill. \u201cKyle worked out every day. He was feeling like 100 percent over Christmas. The day after Christmas, he woke me up and said: \u2018Dad, my head is killing me. Something\u2019s not right.\u2019 Then he started vomiting. We threw him in the car, came up to Children\u2019s (Hospital), and when we got to Colfax he was unconscious.\u201d\n\nIn surgery, doctors found two brain tumors. One had caused a brain hemorrhage.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never woken up from the surgery,\u201d Bill said Thursday while keeping vigil along with his wife, daughter and several of Kyle\u2019s teammates.\n\n\u201cHonorary brother\u201d\n\nMacIntosh won the Colorado Class 5A 300-meter hurdles title for Littleton High School in 2009, and a year later he was part of a 400-meter relay team at CU that qualified for the NCAA championships.\n\nMacIntosh\u2019s primary event was the 400-meter hurdles, considered by many the most grueling event in track.\n\n\u201cAs soon as he got here, the first thing I noticed, he was a very fierce competitor,\u201d said CU sprint coach Drew Morano. \u201cHe had a way of blocking everything out and really getting into a race, having great focus. He could be laughing, and 10 seconds later he could step on the line and do a great rep in practice. He just had a way to zone in and focus and go after it.\n\n\u201cHe was one of those people you loved to have on your team. Everybody wanted to be his friend.\u201d\n\nGifford urged his coaches to let MacIntosh run the anchor leg of their relays.\n\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s always had that strength and that fight,\u201d said Gifford, a Chatfield graduate. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that never gives up.\u201d\n\nFor the past two weeks, Kyle\u2019s teammates, past and present, have gathered daily in the waiting area near his third-floor room in the pediatric intensive care unit at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado. They hang out for hours hoping to spend some time with him, maybe elicit a response. Family members say Kyle doesn\u2019t respond to doctors, but there is a flicker of awareness when teammates are present.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be somewhat responsive, where his eyes will open,\u201d said Kyle\u2019s sister, Kendra. \u201cPast few days, the kids will show him videos. His eyes are tracking the videos and kind of watching. He\u2019s starting to get a little bit of response. The doctors are going to start working with him on blinking. Right now it\u2019s like blink on command. We\u2019re trying to get him to: one blink for yes and two for no.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, his condition was upgraded to \u201cserious but stable,\u201d and he was moved out of intensive care.\n\nNever quit working out\n\nHe thought it was a running injury, except it didn\u2019t act like one. He was having pain in his tailbone in December 2013, but it didn\u2019t hurt when he ran. It hurt when he sat or lay in bed.\n\nA CU athletic trainer recommended an MRI, which detected a mass the size of a grapefruit in his pelvic area. A biopsy identified it as Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, which strikes about 250 people per year in the U.S., most of them young. The cancer had spread to his lungs. He had his first chemotherapy treatment on New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nInitially, he responded well. Six rounds of heavy chemo reduced the mass to the size of a berry, which was treated with radiation. Tumors in his lungs shrank, leaving two small ones, and he had surgery to remove the lower lobe of his right lung.\n\nBut soon the cancer came back. Doctors tried new forms of chemo, but to no avail.\n\nKendra, who is 11 years older than her brother, found a specialist in North Carolina who set him up with a clinical trial for experimental immunotherapy. Six tumors were removed from his lungs, and from them doctors created a vaccine specific to his cancer. He resumed training with a defiant attitude, intent on running again.\n\n\u201cPeople said: \u2018How does Kyle feel so good? How does he do it through chemo and radiation and lung surgery?\u2019 \u201d said his father. \u201cKyle said, \u2018I earned the right to feel good, because I work out every day after chemo.\u2019 He just never quit working out. He was going to get back on the track. Cancer is a thief. It takes many things from you, but it wasn\u2019t going to take that from Kyle, the thing he loved.\u201d\n\nKyle even tried to look at the bright side of having cancer.\n\nSaid Kendra: \u201cHis approach was: \u2018I\u2019m so happy this is happening to me at 22 years old. It\u2019s just going to change me and make me a better person. I\u2019d rather get it now than at 65. It\u2019s going to allow me to have so much more knowledge and a better outlook on life.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThe influence of his outlook finds witness in the large group of friends who show up every day at the hospital. One day there were 29 of them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a testament of their love for Kyle and what Kyle\u2019s done for them,\u201d Kendra said.\n\nNurses have noticed his vital signs improve when friends are present.\n\n\u201cThe doctors say, \u2018We can\u2019t get him to open his eyes,\u2019 \u201d Bill said. \u201cI say, \u2018Come when the kids are here and you\u2019ll see his eyes open.\u2019 \u201c\n\nKyle\u2019s parents and sister remain at the hospital around the clock.\n\n\u201cWe sleep here, eat here,\u201d said Kyle\u2019s mother, Nancy. \u201cThey help us, those kids. They are just unbelievable.\u201d\n\nJohn Meyer: 303-954-1616, jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer\n\nHelping Kyle MacIntosh\n\nFriends have set up a crowdfunding site to help with MacIntosh\u2019s medical expenses titled K-Mac Strength (gofundme.com).
