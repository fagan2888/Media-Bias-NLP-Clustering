Mark Udall and Republican Rep. Cory Gardner, are battling over issues of abortion, personhood and birth control pills.\n\nAs a result, citizens of the Rocky Mountain State are being bombarded with political ads targeting women voters.\n\nLast month, Udall, 64, accused Gardner of taking Colorado\u2019s women and families \u201cbackwards.\u201d\n\nThe video attacks Gardner for sponsoring a bill that would grant constitutional rights for individuals \u201cat the beginning of biological development,\u201d thereby limiting women\u2019s access to abortion.\n\nBut in March, Gardner, 40, announced he was wrong to support the measure. In an interview with The Denver Post, he said:\n\nThe fact that it restricts contraception, it was not the right position. I\u2019ve learned to listen. I don\u2019t get everything right the first time. There are far too many politicians out there who take the wrong position and stick with it and never admit that they should do something different.\n\nBut Udall isn\u2019t letting Gardner off the hook. Chris Harris, Udall\u2019s campaign spokesman, called the move \u201can election year stunt.\u201d\n\nTurning the tables, Gardner issued attacks on Udall\u2019s support for Obamacare.\n\nIn a series of political ads released this summer, Gardner blasted Udall\u2019s record of voting with President Obama 99 percent of the time, arguing his support for the Affordable Care Act has stripped away women\u2019s rights to choose their own doctors and health care plans.\n\n\u201cMark Udall lied to the people of Colorado,\u201d he said in an August attack ad highlighting the 335,000 Coloradans who lost their health insurance plans. Instead, said Gardner, citizens of the Rocky Mountain State need \u201creal\u201d health care reform.\n\nMost recently, Gardner\u2019s team went on the offense, flooding the airwaves with ads touting the Republican candidate\u2019s support for \u201cmodern policies,\u201d like over-the-counter contraception. In a June opinion piece in The Denver Post, Gardner argued the measure would save women time and money.\n\nRecent polls show Gardner with a slight lead over Udall.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the 2014 Senate race heats up in the Rocky Mountains, candidates focus their attention on winning over the female vote.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "As the 2014 Senate race heats up in the Rocky Mountains, candidates focus their attention on winning over the female vote.", "title": "War Over Women: Colorado Senate Candidates Fight for Female Vote", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/5479816511_4c7a958458_o.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-01T22:17:14+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1v8Ys4k"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "As the 2014 Senate race heats up in the Rocky Mountains, candidates focus their attention on winning over the female vote.", "title": "War Over Women: Colorado Senate Candidates Fight for Female Vote", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/5479816511_4c7a958458_o.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "elections,law,politics,society", "published_time": "2014-10-02T03:01:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-01T22:17:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "colorado senate race, colorado elections, colorado reproductive rights, colorado birth control, cory gardner, mark udall, the denver post"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd979a\"", "article_summary": "Health care and women\u2019s reproductive rights are stealing the spotlight in Colorado\u2019s 2014 Senate race.\nChris Harris, Udall\u2019s campaign spokesman, called the move \u201can election year stunt.\u201dTurning the tables, Gardner issued attacks on Udall\u2019s support for Obamacare.\nInstead, said Gardner, citizens of the Rocky Mountain State need \u201creal\u201d health care reform.\nAs a result, citizens of the Rocky Mountain State are being bombarded with political ads targeting women voters.\nThe two candidates, incumbent Democratic Sen.
