Marco Rubio of Florida, who repeated similar lines about President Obama during Saturday\u2019s GOP debate as he was being criticized for appearing overly scripted, said Monday he feels great about the debate and that the message is a central part of his 2016 presidential campaign theme.\n\n\u201cIt was the biggest fundraising night we\u2019ve had in all of the debates, so I feel great about it and we\u2019re going to continue to say the truth: Barack Obama is systematically trying to carry out an effort to change this country and that\u2019s why this election is so important,\u201d Mr. Rubio said on \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d \u201cWe need to stop that from continuing.\u201d\n\nMr. Rubio ticked off a list of his own accomplishments, including new sanctions on Hezbollah and bringing accountability to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\n\u201cBut the core of this campaign is that statement and I am going to continue to say it: Barack Obama is deliberately carrying out a strategy to change America,\u201d Mr. Rubio said. \u201cHe wants to redefine this country. It is one of the main reasons why I\u2019m running, and it\u2019s one of the reasons why I feel so good about our debate performance despite whatever the media people want to say.\u201d\n\nMr. Rubio said Mr. Obama now has seven years of presidential experience and that he\u2019s as bad today as he was in his first year.\n\n\u201cThe issue is that he is carrying out an effort to change the country, to make it more like the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cObamacare was not an accident. Dodd-Frank was not an accident. The deal with Iran was not an accident. Now, they may have been incompetent in how they manage[d] government on a daily basis, but in terms of the policies they\u2019re pursuing, these are intentional strategies to redefine the role of our government and our country and the role of America in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026one of the main reasons why I\u2019m running for president, because I believe if we continue on that road, it\u2019s going to deny our children the opportunity to live in the greatest country in the history of the world, so that\u2019s the core of our campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to continuing to say it. I hope they keep replaying those lines.\u201d\n\nAt Saturday\u2019s GOP debate in New Hampshire, Mr. Rubio had come under heavy fire from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for being overly scripted, and repeated similar lines about Mr. Obama\u2019s intentions.\n\nBusinessman Donald Trump, who is leading in the polls on New Hampshire, said Monday he thought he might have been hearing things Saturday.\n\n\u201cI was standing next to him - it was an amazing thing,\u201d Mr. Trump said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d \u201cI have a good memory, and I\u2019m listening and I [heard] him make the statement. And that was fine. And then he made it a second time, and that was sort of fine, you know, that was okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then he made it a third time, a fourth time, and a fifth time, and I\u2019m saying, am I hearing things? What\u2019s going on over here?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI like Marco, but Marco has a tendency to sweat,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cPerhaps at a record-setting level. And I was watching him making statements five times and he was really hot. He was sweating.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
