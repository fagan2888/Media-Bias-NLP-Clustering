(Newser) – With Donald Trump as the presumptive GOP nominee, there's now a stronger-than-ever chance that President Trump will be sworn in next January—and his first 100 days in office will have just finished by this time next year. The New York Times interviewed Trump three times and spoke to aides and analysts to find out what those 100 days might be like. Some highlights:



Inauguration Day will involve some "beautiful" galas, but also the rescinding of President Obama's executive orders on immigration, Trump says.

Trump says on Day 1, he will also speak to military and Homeland Security officials about sealing the border with Mexico. Talks with wall-builders will soon follow.
