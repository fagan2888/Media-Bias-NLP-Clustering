Rebels give as good as they get, blindly lobbing shells back at an unseen foe.\n\nAs fighting edges ever closer to the center, hundreds of thousands have fled a city once home to 1 million people. The bustle of a major industrial center has given way to the stillness of fear.\n\nCollege teacher Nataliya Badibina said she would have left to stay with relatives in Russia were it not for her mother and father.\n\n\u201cMy parents are ill. They live nearby and I am not going to leave them,\u201d said Badibina, whose apartment block in Donetsk\u2019s western Petrovsky district had its windows blown out by shrapnel from a Grad rocket that landed in her courtyard.\n\nPetrovsky district is on the edge of Donetsk and near some of the heaviest fighting seen in the city.\n\nA local supermarket is still open and provides groceries for anybody with the money to buy them. Most people do their shopping before lunchtime, said Badibina, after which the daily booms of artillery start anew.\n\nA few restaurants have braved the shelling and serve customers, albeit typically giving notice that they close well before the 11 p.m. rebel-imposed curfew. After that, the streets become deserted and an even ghostlier silence descends, only to be periodically punctured in the night by artillery booms.\n\nFunds for many are running dry as pensions and government salaries are held up. City council spokesman Maxim Rovinsky said those paid on bank cards still get their money. Many others haven\u2019t been paid since June.\n\nOn Tuesday, a crowd formed outside the 11th floor rebel headquarters in Donetsk amid rumors that pension and disability payments and child assistance were being given out.\n\nHolding a sheaf of photocopied documents, Vyacheslav Melnikov said he was there to apply for money for his two disabled grandchildren.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even have enough money to feed them. I hope they will help us,\u201d he said.\n\nOne woman in line, Tatyana Ostrovksaya, said she wanted to be paid the money due to her brother, Viktor, who was killed in a rocket attack earlier in the month.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re supposed to pay out two months\u2019 worth of pension, but nobody will pay it to me,\u201d Ostrovksaya said.\n\nIt is not immediately clear where the funds to pay such applicants will come from. Rebel leaders announced months ago that they would raise funds by levying taxes from local businesses, but almost all private enterprises have ceased to operate altogether.\n\nShops in pedestrian underpasses feel relatively safe from bombardment, although the racket of trams passing overhead can unnerve newcomers likely to mistake it for a rocket hitting the ground. Business owners say they have long become accustomed to the sounds of war. The sheer imprecision of the weapons being indiscriminately used by rebels and government forces alike makes a target of everybody.\n\nEven as chaos brews, a kind of ersatz normality has taken over.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ukraine\u2019s rebel capital seeks ersatz normality", "author": "Peter Leonard", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ukraine\u2019s rebel capital seeks ersatz normality", "title": "Ukraine\u2019s rebel capital seeks ersatz normality", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/20/ukraines_rebel_capital_seeks_ersatz_normality/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/russia-ukraine.jpeg10-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ukraine\u2019s rebel capital seeks ersatz normality", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/russia-ukraine.jpeg10-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Ukraine\u2019s rebel capital seeks ersatz normality", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Ukraine\u2019s rebel capital seeks ersatz normality", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4068\"", "article_summary": "Even as chaos brews, a kind of ersatz normality has taken over.\nAs fighting edges ever closer to the center, hundreds of thousands have fled a city once home to 1 million people.\nThe sheer imprecision of the weapons being indiscriminately used by rebels and government forces alike makes a target of everybody.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsDONETSK, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 It has been weeks since Donetsk last had a traffic jam.\nPetrovsky district is on the edge of Donetsk and near some of the heaviest fighting seen in the city."}
