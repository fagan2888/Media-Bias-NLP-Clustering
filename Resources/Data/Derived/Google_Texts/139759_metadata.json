The unit is equipped to hold up to 50 patients, but it currently set up to hold 20.\n\nAccording to Dr. Chris Lombardozzi, SRHS is full to adult capacity. The emergency room has been holding patients that need beds and other patients that don't need beds.\n\nGreenville Hospital System officials said in a statement: \u201cThe volumes in many of our GHS emergency departments have been higher the past two months than this same time last year.\u201d\n\nHealth officials said, despite the high volume, the number of flu cases seems to be going down.\n\nThe AnMed system had 371 confirmed cases of flu in December and 173 so far this month.\n\nThe Greenville Hospital System had 654 positive tests in mid-December, compared to 181 as of Feb. 1.\n\nBean said, \"From the flu standpoint we're on the downswing, hopefully.\"\n\nIf you think you do have the flu or just don't feel well, Bean says you can save yourself a lot of time by going to your doctor or even urgent or minor care.\n\n\"Certainly, the best use of the emergency room is for true medical emergencies with heart attacks, strokes, bad injuries, car wrecks and things of that sort,\" Bean said.\n\nHe also says it's not too late to get a flu shot.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Wed, 11 Feb 2015 18:22:42 EST", "generator": "CoreMedia", "og": {"site_name": "WYFF4", "description": "Upstate hospitals are extremely busy this winter, so much so that one had to come up with a creative solution so no one gets turned away.", "title": "Volume of ER patients forces hospital to use tent", "url": "http://www.wyff4.com/news/Volume-of-ER-patients-forces-hospital-to-use-tent/31220978", "image": "http://www.wyff4.com/image/view/-/31221036/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/12786o8/-/Spartanburg-Regional-tent-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.wyff4.com/news/Volume-of-ER-patients-forces-hospital-to-use-tent/31220978", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "wyff://content/article/31220978", "iphone": "wyff://content/article/31220978", "googleplay": "wyff://content/article/31220978"}, "name": {"ipad": "wyff", "iphone": "wyff", "googleplay": "wyff"}, "id": {"ipad": 505507641, "iphone": 505507641, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.wyff"}}, "site": "@wyffnews4", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "wyff://content/article/31220978", "app_name": "wyff", "package": "com.hearst.android.wyff"}, "ios": {"url": "wyff://content/article/31220978", "app_store_id": 505507641, "app_name": "wyff"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 135671321180}, "keywords": "local greenville news, breaking greenville news, live greenville alerts", "google-site-verification": "LWpc590JPr9qDk05qHGWcq1nIo4PF7VlkN6wQmjiOb8", "news_keywords": "local greenville news, breaking greenville news, live greenville alerts", "description": "Upstate hospitals are extremely busy this winter, so much so that one had to come up with a creative solution so no one gets turned away."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4a89\"", "article_summary": "The emergency room has been holding patients that need beds and other patients that don't need beds.\nThe Greenville Hospital System had 654 positive tests in mid-December, compared to 181 as of Feb. 1.\nSpartanburg Regional Hospital System acquired the mobile medical unit after Hurricane Katrina.\nIt took six hours to put up the mobile unit on Monday, and patients started being cared for in the tent on Wednesday.\n\"I know it's been busy in the emergency room as well as in the hospital itself,\u201d he said."}
