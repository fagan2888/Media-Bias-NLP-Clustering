That was far below the state\u2019s initial projections that at least 250 policies would be offered.\n\nIn total, eight companies will offer plans under 10 so-called \u201cissuers,\u201d compared with six companies that sold plans under eight brand names last year.\n\nNotably absent in Illinois in 2014 was the state\u2019s second-largest insurer, UnitedHealthcare, which opted to sit out amid uncertainty in the market. The company confirmed Thursday that it plans to offer policies on the marketplace in 2015, as previously reported by the Tribune.\n\n\u201cThis is a first step that will help inform our final participation decision, and we look forward to continuing our conversations throughout the approval process,\u201d said Kevin Shermach, a United spokesman.\n\nThe Illinois exchange, an online marketplace where consumers can compare and purchase private health plans is hosted at HealthCare.gov. It is a key pillar of the Affordable Care Act, the landmark 2010 health law that expanded coverage to millions of Americans, including about 566,000 Illinoisans, this year.\n\nThrough April 19, just more than 217,000 gained private coverage offered through the exchange, a market dominated by the state\u2019s largest insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois.\n\nBlue Cross said it enrolled about 200,000 people on the Illinois exchange in the first year, good for about 92 percent of the market. It plans to sell exchange-based plans again for 2015. .\n\nIts dominance left little for other carriers, including the start-up Land of Lincoln Health, a co-op nonprofit funded in part with a $160 million federal loan that was able to sign up about 3,500 customers in its first year.\n\nLand of Lincoln has said it plans to participate again in 2015. As will Health Alliance, the Urbana-based insurer that offered plans throughout the state in 2014 aside from in Cook County.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-chicagotribune", "description": "Eight insurance companies are seeking approval to sell 504 separate health plans next year on the Illinois health insurance exchange, a noteworthy increase from 2014, Illinois said Thursday.
