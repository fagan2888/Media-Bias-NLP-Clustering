Coming up this evening at 9, Piers Morgan welcomes a full studio audience, and a collection of insightful and entertaining guests, as he hosts a lively and informative hour entitled “Losing It: America’s Fat Obsession.”

With the program dedicated to healthy eating and weight loss, the "Piers Morgan Live" host welcomes Jared Fogle, the American icon best known for becoming the face of Subway after losing 245 pounds through a daily ritual centered around eating exclusively from the sandwich chain.

The international brand capitalized on Fogle's success, making him and his “fat pants” the stars of their new ad campaign. Welcoming the fit guru via satellite, Morgan began by asking his guest if he still dines on Subway.

“I do,” he begins. “I don’t eat it every single day anymore,” he continued, in the process reassuring Morgan that he has kept the weight off since his first Subway ad.

When asked if he still has his famous “fat pants” from his days of being overweight, Jared proudly displays the old jeans with the massive 60 inch waist, joking that luckily they are the “relaxed fit.”

Fogle continues on a more serious note:

“But it's a good reminder for me, obviously, you know, people are always fascinated to see the pants. It's a great visual aid. And especially when I'm talking to kids," he tells Morgan. "You know, I speak to children all over the country and, actually, all over the world now, about my story, the fact that they know me really well from TV then really try to have a good message for them about the mistakes that I made.”

Watch the clip for more of Morgan's interview with Fogle, and for the full edition of “Losing It: America’s Fat Obsession,” watch CNN tonight at 9.
