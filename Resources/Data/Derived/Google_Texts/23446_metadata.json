Critics say it has installed \u201cdeath panels\u201d in the nation\u2019s health-care system and is pushing out free-market solutions.\n\nIt\u2019s exactly as planned, according to Lee Hieb, M.D., the former president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.\n\n\u201cWhat we have is the purposeful destruction of the American medical system in order to force the United States to adopt socialized medicine,\u201d Heib said in an interview with WND.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s look at the butcher\u2019s bill after five years of Obamacare \u2013 failing hospitals, rising costs and an unsustainable business model for health care professions,\u201d she said.\n\nHieb predicted all of this in her book \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s your path over the hurdles of government healthcare, in \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nShe suggests government regulations are forcing doctors and hospitals into a \u201cbusiness death spiral\u201d that will only accelerate as Obamacare remains in place.\n\nAs hospitals and insurance companies struggle to survive, Americans will confront \u201cbigger and bigger entities\u201d less capable of providing care.\n\nIn \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown,\u201d Hieb identifies \u201chospitals in inner cities or poor regions around the country \u2026 closing their doors\u201d as a telltale sign of eventual \u201ccatastrophic failure.\u201d\n\nAs WND reported last weekend, 48 rural hospitals have closed since 2010 and approximately 300 are in danger of closing soon.\n\n\u201cThe closures of rural hospitals are a huge warning sign for the American health care system,\u201d Hieb said. \u201cBut this is just the beginning as Obamacare is imposing huge costs on health care professionals at all levels.\u201d\n\nHieb also predicted insurance companies would consolidate and charge higher prices to compensate for the increased costs imposed by federal legislation. The New York Daily News reported the National Bureau of Economic Research recently concluded 2014 insurance premiums for those who don\u2019t get coverage through work were 24.4 percent higher than they would have been without Obamacare.\n\nFinally, Hieb foresaw as Obamacare expanded Medicaid eligibility that payouts would not be enough to compensate physicians for the increased workload and compliance requirements. Physicians and specialists would no longer be able to afford to work as they would actually be punished for their productivity.\n\nShe said Medicare and Medicaid \u201cpaid less and less, and the cost of doing business became more and more expensive as the government added thousands of pages of regulation.\u201d\n\nIn addition to getting paid less, doctors \u201chave the increasing likelihood of being prosecuted under Medicare fraud and abuse statutes\u201d as they struggle to comply with elaborate and confusing paperwork requirements, she said.\n\nAs Hieb expected, medical organizations are now reporting a \u201cphysician shortage\u201d that will only increase in the future.\n\nA recent study commissioned by the Association of American Medical Colleges projected \u201cdemand for physicians will exceed supply by a range of 46,000 to 90,000\u201d people, with most of the shortfall taking place among specialists and non-primary care physicians. According to the study, fully implementing Obamacare accounts for part of the increase in demand.\n\nObamacare is also held responsible for a reported increase in emergency room visits, despite Democratic Party promises the Affordable Care Act would actually reduce these kinds of costly visits.\n\nA study from the American College of Emergency Physicians found almost half of physicians polled experienced an increase in emergency room visits, while 86 percent of emergency room physicians expected future increases and more than three fourths predicted their facilities were insufficient to handle the increased demand.\n\nHieb explained while Obamacare has increased \u201ccoverage\u201d in a theoretical sense, it hasn\u2019t actually provided real access to quality medical care.\n\n\u201cThe issue isn\u2019t \u2018coverage,\u2019 it\u2019s what you actually get with insurance. The only real theoretical winners under Obamacare are young people who can now say they have \u2018coverage,\u2019 but they haven\u2019t tried to obtain care yet. For seniors, cost containment and rationing is built into Obamacare and they are getting less than what they had before.\u201d\n\nHieb also contends Obamacare corrupts American life at a deeper level, because increased costs and regulatory burdens make it impossible to provide the kind of voluntary aid Americans used to be able to fall back on.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve effectively priced out charity. It used to be if you didn\u2019t get care, a church, family, or community could come to your aid. But now there is both the expectation the government will provide care and there are fewer resources for private groups and individuals because of increased costs,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat happens is that what the government can provide is all you get. And as Obamacare remains in place, it can provide less and less.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, health care costs will consume 31 percent of per capita income by 2022, a dramatic increase from 7 percent in 1960. Insurance premiums are also skyrocketing, she said.\n\n\u201cAmericans are paying more than ever and receiving less,\u201d concluded Hieb. \u201cFive years after Obamacare, as I predicted in \u2018Surviving the Medical Meltdown,\u2019 we can see that Obamacare is nothing less than a planned demolition of our healthcare industry.\u201d\n\nShe said Obamacare \u201ccan\u2019t work, because it wasn\u2019t designed to work.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe real alternative is the way we built the finest health care system in the world, by not having a \u2018system \u2018at all but private individuals, hospitals and charities,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut unless Obamacare is repealed and we reject this idea that the government must provide a \u2018system,\u2019 I fear most people will believe universal socialist health care system is the only alternative to the mess Obamacare has deliberately created.\u201d\n\nSee other Obamacare reports:\n\nNew investigation over Obamacare architect Gruber\n\n5 years later, Obamacare\u2019s broken promises get worse", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "President Obama\u2019s Affordable Health Care Act, which reached five years old Monday, still faces multiple legal challenges that may end up at the Supreme Court.
