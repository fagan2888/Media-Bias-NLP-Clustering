To illustrate, he pointed to the salaries of two senior advisors to the president, Valerie Jarrett and Dan Pfeiffer, who both make $172,200 per year.\n\nBut that is clearly not the case when one compares Thiele\u2019s title and salary to that of Galbraith.\n\nEarnest admitted that there is \u201cstill more work to do at the White House\u201d to equalize salaries between men and women, but he said the institution is doing better than the private sector.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t hold up the White House as the perfect example here,\u201d Earnest added at the briefing.\n\nRegarding the position of Senior Policy Advisor for Native American Affairs \u2013 the top position at the Obama White House dealing exclusively with tribal issues \u2013 Jodi Gillete, a Standing Rock Sioux citizen, has made $100,000 for each year she has held the position. That is the same salary Cherokee Nation citizen Kim Teehee made in the position before she joined the Mapetsi Indian lobbying firm after the president\u2019s first term.\n\nWhile the pay for the Native affairs advisor has been consistent through the tenures of Teehee and Gillette, it is still currently substantially less than top advisors in other subject areas earn.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The recent release of the White House\u2019s annual salary report shows a gender gap in salaries for those focused on Native American issues.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/07/white-house-paid-native-woman-less-man-job-155678", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/white_house_equal_pay.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "White House Paid Native Woman Less Than Man for Job"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "White House Paid Native Woman Less Than Man for Job"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/07/white-house-paid-native-woman-less-man-job-155678", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-07T08:00-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Jodi Gillete, Kim Teehee, Senior Policy Advisor for Native American Affairs, President Barack Obama, Sen.
