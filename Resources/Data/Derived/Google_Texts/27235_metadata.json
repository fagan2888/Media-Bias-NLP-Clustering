California, Chief Justice John Roberts quotes from a concurring opinion Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote two years ago in U.S. v. Jones.\n\n\u201cGPS monitoring generates a precise, comprehensive record of a person\u2019s public movements that reflects a wealth of detail about her familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations,\u201d she wrote in that case holding that GPS monitoring was a search.\n\nRoberts used Sotomayor\u2019s earlier argument to support his own assertion that data stored on cellphones was qualitatively different than physical records. His citation of her opinion served to do more than support the new decision \u2013 which generally requires cops to get a warrant before they search a cellphone after arresting someone. It also codified Sotomayor\u2019s contention that technology requires a reconsideration of key Fourth Amendment precedents.\n\nThe decision is momentous in its own right. It dealt with two difference cases involving men who had their cellphones searched after being detained, which led to evidence used to prosecute them on more serious charges. Roberts held that cellphones hold far more private information than even someone\u2019s home, and as such shouldn\u2019t be searched in the same way as someone\u2019s pockets could be.\n\nHe sounded like the ACLU when he explained what to do about it. \u201cOur answer to the question of what police must do before searching a cellphone seized incident to an arrest is accordingly simple\u2014 get a warrant.\u201d\n\nIn real life, it\u2019s likely that cops will integrate cellphone search warrants into their arrest warrant process. And Roberts\u2019 opinion allows police to invoke exigent circumstances to search a phone. But at a minimum, this ruling will prohibit suspicion-less searches of cellphones.\n\nWhich brings me back to Roberts\u2019 citation of Sotomayor.\n\nA different part of Sotomayor\u2019s concurrence, arguing that the existing precedent holding that you don\u2019t have a privacy interest in data you\u2019ve given to a third party \u201cis ill suited to the digital age,\u201d has been invoked repeatedly in privacy debates since she wrote it. That\u2019s especially true since the beginning of Edward Snowden\u2019s leaks. Lawsuits against the phone dragnet often cite that passage, arguing that the phone dragnet is precisely the kind of intrusion that far exceeds the intent of old precedent. And the courts have \u2013 with the exception of one decision finding the phone dragnet unconstitutional \u2013 ruled that until a majority on the Supreme Court endorses this notion, the old precedents hold.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservative judges held that cops can't just search your phone like they're your pockets.
