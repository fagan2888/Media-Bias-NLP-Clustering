And so former Vice President Al Gore\u2019s discussion at Nashville\u2019s tech-focused Southland Conference this week could be viewed in context as a jeremiad spotlighting taboo truths about tech culture and philanthropic traditions.\n\nDiscussing the economy, Gore lamented that \u201cwe have rising levels of inequality and chronic underinvestment\u201d in public programs. He reminded the crowd that when \u201c95 percent of all the additional national income in the U.S., since the recovery began in \u201909, goes to the top 1 percent, that\u2019s not an Occupy Wall Street slogan, that\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n\nGore may have been alluding to the tech economy becoming a significant driver of that inequality.\n\nAs Princeton economist Alan Blinder noted in a January Wall Street Journal Op-Ed, technology is \u201cclearly the major villain\u201d in rising economic inequality, as \u201ce-commerce eliminated many \u2018ordinary\u2019 jobs (while) enhanc(ing) the opportunities and rewards for some \u2018extraordinary\u2019 jobs.\u201d One way to see this is in the app economy, which often rewards billions to companies with relatively few employees, thus concentrating wealth in fewer hands.\n\nLater in his discussion, Gore said that \u201cdemocracy has been hacked\u201d by moneyed interests. Then, in response to a question about tech billionaires spending big on allegedly philanthropic enterprises, he said: \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, as long as the rest of us don\u2019t ever fall prey to the illusion that charity is going to do the job of what democracy needs to do.\u201d\n\nThose latter comments come only a few weeks after Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg announced a $120 million donation to San Francisco-area schools. That donation came only a few years after California considered a ballot measure to increase funding for its schools. Zuckerberg was notably absent from the campaign to pass the measure.\n\nThat detail is germane to Gore\u2019s point about charity and democracy. Indeed, there seems to be a trend of billionaires and tech firms making private donations to public institutions ostensibly with the goal of improving public services. Yet, many of these billionaires are absent from efforts to raise public resources for those same institutions. Zuckerberg is only one example.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former vice president rails against America's exploding income inequality at a Nashville tech conference", "title": "\u201cDemocracy has been hacked\u201d: Al Gore channels his inner Thomas Piketty", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The former vice president rails against America's exploding income inequality at a Nashville tech conference", "title": "\u201cDemocracy has been hacked\u201d: Al Gore channels his inner Thomas Piketty", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/12/democracy_has_been_hacked_al_gore_channels_his_inner_thomas_piketty_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/al_gore.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former vice president rails against America's exploding income inequality at a Nashville tech conference", "title": "\u201cDemocracy has been hacked\u201d: Al Gore channels his inner Thomas Piketty", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/08/al_gore.jpg", "creator": "@@davidsirota", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "David Sirota", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Al Gore, Income Inequaltiy, Koch Brothers, nashville, Tech Conference, Thomas Piketty", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Discussing the economy, Gore lamented that \u201cwe have rising levels of inequality and chronic underinvestment\u201d in public programs.\nLater in his discussion, Gore said that \u201cdemocracy has been hacked\u201d by moneyed interests.\nTopics: Al Gore, Income Inequaltiy, Koch Brothers, nashville, Tech Conference, Thomas Piketty, Technology News, Business News, Politics NewsInequality and democracy are the kind of topics you may expect to hear about at a political convention, but not necessarily at a tech industry conference.\nYet, many of these billionaires are absent from efforts to raise public resources for those same institutions.\nIndeed, there seems to be a trend of billionaires and tech firms making private donations to public institutions ostensibly with the goal of improving public services."}
