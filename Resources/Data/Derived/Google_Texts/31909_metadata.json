The district is dominated by the Treasure Coast and includes part of northern Palm Beach County.\n\nMurphy defeated Republican first termer, Allen West in a district that Mitt Romney won with 52 percent of the vote. Since then, Murphy has worked the district like a small town mayor. He also has not been shy about bucking the White House.\n\nIn Domino's first television ad, he reminds voters that Murphy supports ObamaCare and immigration reform. (Note: Republican U.S. Senator Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush also support immigration reform). Murphy is one of only a handful of Democrats to cross the aisle to support dozens of legislative fixes to the healthcare law.\n\nDomino is getting little help from Republican leaders and is relying on his own deep pockets to foot much of the bill for his campaign.\n\nMurphy, who is one of the congressional Democrats top fundraisers, is offering a centrist posture to voters. Roll Call recently changed its rating of the race from \"Lean Democrat\" to \"Democrat Favored.\"\n\nDomino's ad opens with these lines:\n\n\"Washington is broken and Congressman Patrick Murphy is a piece of the problem. Standing with Nancy Pelosi on issues like ObamaCare and amnesty for illegal immigrants.\"\n\n\"To fix Washington, Patrick Murphy is a bad fit.\"\n\nHere is the Domino ad:\n\nIn Murphy's ad, he looks directly at the camera and begins with:\n\n\"I'm Patrick Murphy. Two years ago, I promised to be an independent fighter for you. Remember?\"\n\nThe ad then shows a clip from his 2012 campaign where Murphy says:\n\n\"In Congress, I will work across party lines to make it happen.\"\n\nHere is the Murphy ad:\n\nFollow us on Twitter @CrowleyReport", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Florida, politics, news, election, campaign, Rick Scott, Republican, Democrats, 2016 presidential campaign, Brian Crowley, senate, governor, Tallahassee, governors race,", "og": {"site_name": "Crowley Political Report", "description": "Elections may come and go but politics never stops.", "title": "Crowley Political Report", "url": "http://www.crowleypoliticalreport.com/", "image": "http://up4.typepad.com/6a0133ed0b30dc970b0133f07a70b4970b-220si", "type": "blog"}, "description": "News,analysis and commentary about Florida politics and politicians.", "generator": "http://www.typepad.com/"}, "article_summary": "Murphy, who is one of the congressional Democrats top fundraisers, is offering a centrist posture to voters.\nDomino's ad opens with these lines:\"Washington is broken and Congressman Patrick Murphy is a piece of the problem.\n\"To fix Washington, Patrick Murphy is a bad fit.\"\nHere is the Domino ad:In Murphy's ad, he looks directly at the camera and begins with:\"I'm Patrick Murphy.\nMurphy defeated Republican first termer, Allen West in a district that Mitt Romney won with 52 percent of the vote."}
