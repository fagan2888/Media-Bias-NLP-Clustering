ASIA TRIP White House warns Russia on Ukraine The president spoke three times with the Russian leader, the White House confirmed.\n\nBEIJING \u2014 The White House signaled Tuesday that the latest round of Russia aid to separatists in Ukraine is likely to trigger another round of international sanctions against Russia, but President Barack Obama doesn\u2019t plan to make the issue a focus of international economic summits he\u2019s attending this week in Asia and Australia.\n\n\u201cWe continued to be deeply troubled by Russia\u2019s activities,\u201d Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters traveling with Obama.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the continued provision of support to separatists, including heavy weapons, that are in complete violation of the Minsk agreement,\u201d he added, referring to a deal cut in September among Russia, Ukraine and two separatist groups.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Red-state Democrats rise in Senate)\n\nThe tension over Ukraine increased media interest in any contact between President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin as both men attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit here.\n\nA White House spokeswoman confirmed that the two leaders spoke briefly on three occasions Tuesday and that they discussed Ukraine, as well as Iran and Syria. The spokeswoman said the conversations totaled 15 to 20 minutes, but did not provide any details on the exchange.\n\nWhen the two leaders were seen by reporters and cameras at a photo session Monday night, Putin walked in front of Obama and did not appear to speak to him. At that event, there also seemed to be little eye contact between the two presidents, who have a chilly relationship that Obama has described as \u201cbusinesslike.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: GOP plan: Link Lynch)\n\nRhodes hinted rather bluntly that more sanctions will be on the way if Russia doesn\u2019t quit \u201cescalating the situation.\u201d The White House official also seemed to express some frustration with Putin\u2019s intransigence over Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWhat Russia will find is, if they continue to do that, it\u2019s a recipe for isolation from a broad swath of the international community,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cClearly, what we\u2019ve seen is a troubling focus from President Putin on the situation in Ukraine that is going to demand a response from the international community going forward.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, the U.S. is not planning any special meeting at the APEC summit or other international meetings Obama is to attend in the coming days, such as another Asia-focused summit in Burma and the G20 meeting in Brisbane, U.S. officials said.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obamacare and the low expectations game)\n\n\u201cOur position on Ukraine is well known and is manifested in our sanctions and our policy,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re necessarily looking to \u2026 go out of our way to make the focus of these multilateral meetings Ukraine, in the way that we did when we were in Europe.\u201d\n\nHowever, Rhodes said Obama will talk to Putin about the matter if the two have conversations on the margins of the APEC summit. In addition, Obama discussed Ukraine with Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott in talks in Beijing on Monday and is likely to have conversations about the issue with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the American official said.\n\nRhodes said no when he was asked if the lack of evident U.S. response to the latest Russian moves indicated they were not that worrisome.\n\n\u201cWe do consider it to be particularly alarming that\u2019s why we\u2019ve spoken out about it,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe pathway out of this is very clear\u201d and that the pattern of increasing sanctions in response to such actions was \u201cestablished.\u201d\n\nWhite House aides also disputed claims that U.S. and European sanctions on Russia have fostered deeper ties between Russia and China, which recently announced new energy agreements valued at billions of dollars.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t get the best deal on the energy partnerships they announced,\u201d Rhodes said of the Russians. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a lot of venues to do business in these days.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Obama spoke three times with Putin, the White House confirmed.", "title": "White House warns Russia on Ukraine", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/11/in-china-wh-talks-ukraine-112767.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/11/11/141111_obama_putin_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Vladimir Putin,China,Ukraine,Ben Rhodes", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Obama spoke three times with Putin, the White House confirmed.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb3d9\"", "article_summary": "ASIA TRIP White House warns Russia on Ukraine The president spoke three times with the Russian leader, the White House confirmed.\nPresident Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke briefly Monday night before a dinner that was part of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.\nA White House spokeswoman confirmed that the two leaders spoke briefly on three occasions Tuesday and that they discussed Ukraine, as well as Iran and Syria.\n\u201cWe continued to be deeply troubled by Russia\u2019s activities,\u201d Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters traveling with Obama.\n( Also on POLITICO: Red-state Democrats rise in Senate)The tension over Ukraine increased media interest in any contact between President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin as both men attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit here."}
