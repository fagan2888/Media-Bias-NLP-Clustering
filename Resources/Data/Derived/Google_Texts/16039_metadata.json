Participants, including Hale, braved the clippers in the Quincy, Mass., office lobby in what turned out to be far more than a monetary donation; some employees donated their hair to Locks of Love, according to Ellen's Good News blog.\n\nInitially, Hale sent out an email to employees offering to donate to the institute after another employee stepped forward, offering to shear it all for $1,000 in charity.
