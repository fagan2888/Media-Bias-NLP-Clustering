There are rules.\n\nNo smoking or drinking while in costume. No sitting on the floats. No accosting the celebrities.\n\nAt a one-day training session Saturday \u2014 called \u201cClown U.\u201d \u2014 about 300 Macy\u2019s employees and other clown wannabes were warned not to do \u201canything that might show up on David Letterman\u2019s outtakes.\u201d\n\nOnce they had taken a good-behavior oath \u2014 and survived a chaotic mass warm-up \u2014 it was fun times for the amateurs as professional clowns from the Big Apple Circus and veteran Macy\u2019s promenaders rehearsed them in basic parade routines and forwarded tips such as \u201cConserve your confetti,\u201d \u201cWear layers\u201d and \u201cGo to the bathroom before you put your costume on.\u201d\n\nThe schooling took place at the circus\u2019 big top at Lincoln Center and several adjacent tents left over from Fashion Week.\n\nThe trainees will be among nearly 1,000 volunteer clowns in the parade. They\u2019ll be divided into Keystone Kops, billiard balls, wooden soldiers and 25 more teams, each costumed appropriately and assigned to a balloon or float.\n\nFor example, clowns dressed as cupcakes will be with the Pillsbury Doughboy balloon. Sailor clowns accompany SpongeBob SquarePants.\n\nThe cupcakes\u2019 captain, Susan Mazursky of Scotch Plains, N.J., who was dressed as a cherry pie, is a vice president of strategic planning for Macy\u2019s and is headed for her 23rd parade. She once was costumed as a stick of butter, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably rewarding,\u201d Mazursky said. \u201cOnly the clowns, really, get to interact with the people who are watching the parade. Everybody else is just marching straight ahead, but we get to go over and say \u2018Hi\u2019 and \u2018Happy Thanksgiving\u2019 to the kids, lead people in a cheer.\u201d\n\nLes Kule of Wantagh, dressed up as a clown reporter for the \u201cFunday Times,\u201d with oversize press card and camera, will be in the parade for the 19th time. He\u2019s not a Macy\u2019s employee, but his sister, Amy Kuhl, is the parade\u2019s executive director.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just pure fun, going up to the kids,\u201d he said. \u201cThe smile stays on my face for days.\u201d\n\nBut, he cautioned: \u201cYou do have to be careful how you approach the youngest kids. You don\u2019t want crying, just laughing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Clowns learn the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade", "title": "Clowns learn the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/15/clowns-learn-the-dos-and-donts-of-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141115__20141116_A8_ND16CLOWNSCHOOLp1.jpg", "height": 453}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141115__20141116_A8_ND16CLOWNSCHOOLp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-15T18:14:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T13:57:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0359\"", "article_summary": "For example, clowns dressed as cupcakes will be with the Pillsbury Doughboy balloon.\nNEW YORK \u2014 If you\u2019re going to be a clown in the Thanksgiving Day Parade, you can\u2019t go out there and fool around.\nThe trainees will be among nearly 1,000 volunteer clowns in the parade.\n\u201cOnly the clowns, really, get to interact with the people who are watching the parade.\n\u201cThe smile stays on my face for days.\u201dBut, he cautioned: \u201cYou do have to be careful how you approach the youngest kids."}
