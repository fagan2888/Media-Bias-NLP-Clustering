Grade Rhode Island’s Leaders - From A to F

With Rhode Island faced with some major economic challenges, the state looks to ideas and leaders to help design the recovery. According to IHS , Rhode Island, Michigan and Nevada will not recover to pre-recession job level until 2018.

In order for Rhode Island to move forward economically it will require new idea and strong leadership to create change.

GoLocalProv's MINDSETTER™ Gary Sasse recently wrote, "Rhode Island’s decision-makers must deal with these difficult challenges if they are to successfully position the Ocean State to compete for jobs and investments."

Sasse also points out that other state have taken on such difficult challenges. The states that have bounced back and are have now grown past pre-recession levels are regionally and economically diverse: New York, noAlaska, Texas, Georgia and North Dakota.
