One nurse has been laid off already, according to its outreach coordinator Tino Ratfliff, and the clinic will be operating with a skeleton crew until its closure.\n\nIn a statement, UCSF said the closure was prompted by \u201cfinancial reasons\u201d and that patients would be able to seek treatment at other nearby clinics. They also pointed to a drop in patients recently due to expanded health care coverage from the Affordable Care Act, but did not provide any numbers.\n\nRatliff was more specific, saying that UCSF reported 50 percent fewer patients at the clinic in recent years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a little number,\u201d he said. \u201cThe patients we see \u2014 people are moving out of the city, it\u2019s too expensive for them to live here.\u201d\n\nThat surprised school nurses, who said they haven\u2019t noticed a drop in student referrals.\n\n\u201cI would say people are as sexually active as they have ever been,\u201d said Watts from Mission High.\n\nThe clinic has been on Potrero since 1997 and has the stated goal of decreasing unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections among youth of color.\n\nWatts sends two to three students to the clinic a week for reproductive health services not offered at Mission High \u2014 like pregnancy testing and emergency contraception \u2014 and said the closure of her \u201cgo-to clinic\u201d would mostly affect the black and brown students she refers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s doing a huge disservice to the population here that\u2019s already disadvantaged,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to data on its website, 64 percent of the 1,985 patients it sees every year are from the Mission, Bayview, Excelsior, and Visitacion Valley communities. Some 80 percent are Latino, Asian, or black and 94 percent are between 15 and 24 years old.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really concerned about the closure,\u201d said Wendy Snider, a wellness coordinator at Thurgood Marshall High School in the Bayview. Snider said half of the four to five students she refers to outside clinics weekly go to New Generation because it\u2019s well-known to them.\n\n\u201cA lot of our students are coming from the Mission and Portola, so they\u2019re not familiar with [other clinics],\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you start sending kids [to clinics] that are not as familiar to them, then the follow-up is much less [frequent].\u201d\n\nNot all are worried. Beth Brown, the manager of the clinic, said San Francisco has many other clinics that New Generation\u2019s patients can attend and that the clinic\u2019s staff can apply to work elsewhere within the sprawling UCSF medical system. The university said fewer than 10 staff members would be laid off.\n\n\u201cWe have great clinics in the communities and these neighborhoods, and we\u2019re not worried about [patients] finding places to get great care,\u201d she said. \u201cThe University of California at San Francisco is a big employer\u2026I\u2019m not worried for any of us [staff].\u201d\n\nJoi Jackson-Morgan, who is the deputy director at the Third Street Youth Center and Clinic in the Bayview, was less optimistic. She acknowledged that her clinic and others in the area might be able to absorb patients that would otherwise go to New Generation, but worried that some patients would opt not to go to appointments for fear of running into family members.\n\n\u201cClosing a dedicated youth clinic would increase the chances of patients running into family members,\u201d she said.\n\nWatts, the nurse from Mission High, says the confidentiality of New Generation is a key selling point for students concerned about sharing their sexual activities with family. They worry about going to the same clinics as their parents, she said, and require a youth-only space.\n\n\u201cThe advantage of New Generation is that there\u2019s never a bill sent home,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like going to Mission Neighborhood [Health Clinic] and running into your auntie who\u2019s there for something else.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cvast majority\u201d of patients income-qualify for a state program that pays for coverage, according to Ratliff. That\u2019s critical for those hoping to stay off their family\u2019s medical bills and those in the country without documentation.\n\n\u201cThis is where undocumented youth can go,\u201d Jackson-Morgan said. \u201cCase in point: birth control. If a young woman wants an IUD, out of pocket, it would be $800-$1,000. It\u2019s free at this clinic\u2026so if you\u2019re undocumented it doesn\u2019t cost any of that.\u201d\n\nJackson-Morgan was harshly critical of the closure. She said UCSF is hypocritical for embracing purported progressive values while at the same time closing a clinic that services minority neighborhoods in San Francisco \u2014 especially in light of the new Mission Bay facility.\n\n\u201cThey said it costs to much but they can put this new facility in Mission Bay?\u201d she asked. \u201cWe both know the city\u2019s changing, so it\u2019s a trip that you\u2019re going to close down this one particular clinic that\u2019s serving the most people of color in hopes that [you] push them down that way to Mission Bay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re really trying to do this very hush-hush,\u201d she added, saying no patients have been told of the closure.\n\nBut school nurses have. At the monthly meeting of wellness coordinators \u2014 who are stationed at every high school in the city \u2014 last Wednesday, there was grave concern about the clinic\u2019s closing.\n\n\u201cWe were just mortified that this service was going to possibly close,\u201d said Jodi Tsapis, a wellness coordinator at Downtown High School in Potrero Hill. Letters were sent to city supervisors, the UCSF chancellor, and the medical director of the clinic to protest the closure, she said.\n\n\u201cWe definitely were saying \u2018What can we do to advocate for New Generation?\u2019 It wasn\u2019t just something that went into thin air,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all wondering \u2018What can we do? How can we make noise? How can we reach out to change the direction?\u2019\u201d added Watts.\n\nUpdate: The University of California at San Francisco announced Friday that the closure of New Generation would be delayed until July 31 so the university could coordinate with the Department of Public Health to transition the center\u2019s patients to other health clinics.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health care, public health", "og": {"site_name": "MissionLocal", "description": "See update below.
