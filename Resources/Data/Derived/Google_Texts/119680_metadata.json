That was back in October 2008, when the hectic flush of Obamamania was at its peak. To be fair, it\u2019s taken a bit longer than five days, but here we are, five years into the most destructive presidency in the country\u2019s history, and we can see that fundamental transformation at work just about everywhere.\n\nThe economy: During Obama\u2019s first term, the credit rating of the United States was downgraded by S&P for the first time in history. That might seem pretty abstract: who cares about a country\u2019s credit rating? But then there\u2019s news like this: According to a report released in 2012 by the Federal Reserve, Americans have seen their wealth plummet by 40 percent over the past few years. Hope & Change!\n\nRace relations: They are in a rawer state than I can remember thanks to a president who played the race card at every opportunity. The Cambridge police were \u201cstupid,\u201d according to the president, in the way they handled the case of Henry Louis Gates, Jr., famous Harvard huckster, back in 2009. If he had had a son, said the president, he would \u201clook like\u201d the thug Trayvon Martin, who jumped George Zimmerman and was shot dead by Zimmerman while pounding his head into the concrete sidewalk.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the position of the United States on the world stage. Obama was supposed to hit the \u201creset\u201d button not only with respect to our relations with Russia (how\u2019s that working out?), but also with respect to our position in the world more generally. The bad old days of unilateral action under George W. Bush were to be banished in favor of a kinder, gentler America that was no more \u201cexceptional\u201d than was Britain or Greece. He\u2019s certainly done a lot to make that true.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Fundamentally Transforming the United States of America | Roger\u2019s Rules", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "Roger\u2019s Rules", "description": "Here we are, five years into the most destructive presidency in the country\u2019s history, and we can see that fundamental transformation at work just about everywhere.", "title": "Fundamentally Transforming the United States of America", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/rogerkimball/2013/9/8/fundamentally-transforming-the-united-states-of-america/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/4/files/2012/12/obama_whisper_silence_thumbnail_12-12-12-1.jpg", "updated_time": 1464301264, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here we are, five years into the most destructive presidency in the country\u2019s history, and we can see that fundamental transformation at work just about everywhere.", "title": "Fundamentally Transforming the United States of America", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/rogerkimball/2013/9/8/fundamentally-transforming-the-united-states-of-america/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/4/files/2012/12/obama_whisper_silence_thumbnail_12-12-12-1.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Fundamentally Transforming the United States of America | Roger\u2019s Rules", "pinterestDescription": "Fundamentally Transforming the United States of America", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Fundamentally Transforming the United States of AmericaRemember when candidate Barack Obama promised his acolytes that they were only \u201cfive days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America\u201d?\nThe economy: During Obama\u2019s first term, the credit rating of the United States was downgraded by S&P for the first time in history.\nAnd then there\u2019s the position of the United States on the world stage.\nObama was supposed to hit the \u201creset\u201d button not only with respect to our relations with Russia (how\u2019s that working out?\nThat was back in October 2008, when the hectic flush of Obamamania was at its peak."}
