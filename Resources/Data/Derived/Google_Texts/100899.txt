The African Children's Choir has returned to Bay County for a couple of performances.

Sunday morning they were at the Free Spirit Community Church in Panama City and that evening they performed at First Baptist Church on Grace Avenue.

The African Children's Choir is composed of young children from Uganda that have lost one or both of their parents.

They tour all over the world singing and dancing to raise awareness of the needs of orphaned children in Africa.

"This is a good experience," explained Darrell Kelly, the youth and music pastor at Free Spirit Community Church. "We already are involved in missions in Haiti, so to also bring this group in from Africa is a way to broaden our perspective on how we can reach out and help people all over the world."
