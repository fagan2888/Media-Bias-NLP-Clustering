In the past, Obama has halted the deportations of certain young, undocumented immigrants and ordered modest changes to the federal background check system for gun purchases, among other actions. Progressives are currently pushing the president to raise the minimum wage for federal contractors.\n\n\"We\u2019re not just going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we\u2019re providing Americans the kind of help they need. I\u2019ve got a pen and I\u2019ve got a phone,\" Obama said at a Jan. 14 cabinet meeting.\n\nCarney did not go into specifics on what the president might do. But he expressed hope that further executive action will not be necessary on one key part of the president's second-term agenda.\n\n\"We're actually optimistic that 2014 will be the year Congress delivers to the president's desk a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform,\" he said.\n\nSeparately, Carney was asked whether passing Obamacare would have been worth it if the Democrats lose control of the Senate in the 2014 elections. \"It is absolutely worth it, no matter what happens politically,\" Carney said.\n\nWatch the full clip below: Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Obama's Government Shutdown Stares Obama's Government Shutdown Stares\n\n1 of 51 Barack Obama President Barack Obama makes a statement in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 16, 2013.
