Today the ColoradoCare health insurance plan reached enough signatures to be put on the 2016 ballot.

The plan needed over 98,000 signatures of support in order to be put on next yearâ€™s ballot. With the help of volunteers, over 150 thousand signatures were received and delivered to the office of the Secretary of State Friday morning in Denver.

Today at Mesa County Central Library, Coloradans gathered to celebrate this big step for ColoradoCare.

"This is a historic day. In November of 2016 Coloradans will have a chance to vote. They get two choices; they can vote for ColoradoCare, covers everybody, and saves billions. Or you can vote for the status quote which is ObamaCare and that leaves 380,000 Coloradans with no health insurance at all," said T. R. Reid, an author and filmmaker on health insurance.

ColoradoCare is a health insurance plan that would provide healthcare for every Coloradan up to age 65 and would be financed by a 3.3% payroll tax for all workers.
