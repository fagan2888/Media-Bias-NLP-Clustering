Nearly everyone uses it, but few can say where it came from. Even linguists come up short-handed most times when it comes to explaining the origins of human communication. A new study has turned our understanding of language upside-down by suggesting that how many words you teach children is not nearly as important as how you teach them to use these terms.\n\nIt seems that with language acquisition, quality greatly triumphs over quantity. According to a recent study, which will be presented at a White House conference on Thursday, asking your child if they \u201cwant a bottle after their bath\u201d is far more constructive to their language skills than giving them a constant flow of words. In their study, a team of researchers observed 11- and 14-month-old children, taking note of the verbal interaction they had with their parents. After following these children until age 2, the researchers were able to conclude that the total number of words the children\u2019s parents said to them actually had no correlation with their future linguistic abilities. What did have a direct correlation, however, was the words used.\n\nThe study showed that quality in communication accounted for 27 percent of the variation in expressive language seen later on in life, an observation that did not change with parent\u2019s educational level.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about shoving words in,\u201d Kathryn Hirsh-Pasek, a professor of psychology at Temple University and lead author of the study, told The New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s about having these fluid conversations around shared rituals and objects, like pretending to have morning coffee together or using the banana as a phone. That is the stuff from which language is made.\u201d\n\nHirsh-Pasek explained that inviting the child to be interactive in the language learning process, by using phrases, such as \u201cLook, a dog,\u201d or adding on to their knowledge of newly learned words with reassuring phrases, such as \u201cYes, that is a bus,\u201d significantly increased the child\u2019s language proficiency by age 3.\n\nIn the early 1990s, researchers found that children from lower-income families had 30 million fewer words than children of the same age who were raised in more affluent households. The findings sparked an increased call for publically funded pre-kindergarten programs and sparked nationwide campaigns to get parents to become more verbally interactive with their young children. This new finding will hopefully help to further diminish the language gap between social classes by helping parents of all economic backgrounds better understand how to give their child the best linguistic start in life.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "language, learning, most, influenced, quality, childs, words, not, quantity, them", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A recent study has suggested that how many words you teach your child is not nearly as important as the quality of conversation you have with them.", "title": "Stop Trying To Expand Your Child's Vocabulary", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/language-learning-most-influenced-quality-childs-words-not-quantity-them-307509", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/20/kid_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A recent study has suggested that how many words you teach your child is not nearly as important as the quality of conversation you have with them.", "title": "Stop Trying To Expand Your Child's Vocabulary", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/language-learning-most-influenced-quality-childs-words-not-quantity-them-307509", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/20/kid_1.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/10/20/kid_1.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-10-21T10:24:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-21T10:24:02-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A recent study has suggested that how many words you teach your child is not nearly as important as the quality of conversation you have with them."}, "article_summary": "It seems that with language acquisition, quality greatly triumphs over quantity.\nEven linguists come up short-handed most times when it comes to explaining the origins of human communication.\nIn the early 1990s, researchers found that children from lower-income families had 30 million fewer words than children of the same age who were raised in more affluent households.\nIn their study, a team of researchers observed 11- and 14-month-old children, taking note of the verbal interaction they had with their parents.\nA new study has turned our understanding of language upside-down by suggesting that how many words you teach children is not nearly as important as how you teach them to use these terms."}
