These types of \u201cscope of practice\u201d issues have historically been highly controversial, and groups such as the powerful Florida Medical Association (FMA) oppose lifting physician-supervision requirements.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re against it (the House bill),\u201d Florida Medical Association General Counsel Jeff Scott said after reviewing the newly filed proposal Thursday.\n\nScott, said the new House bill is the broadest scope-of-practice expansion he has seen, and physician groups are already preparing to fight it.\n\nThe House Select Committee on Health Care Workforce Innovation has been studying the practice issues in recent weeks, including holding a lengthy hearing last month.\n\nPhysicians told the committee that ARNPs and CRNAs were valuable members of the healthcare delivery team and that they agree on the need for new approaches to expand primary care. However, the FMA staunchly opposes giving ARNPs and CRNAs autonomy and said \u201cthe best solution is physicians and nurses working collaboratively in a way that does not jeopardize patient safety.\u201d\n\nPrimary care physicians are perceived as the \u201cquarterbacks\u201d of the healthcare team who are responsible for enhancing quality and reducing costs, two hallmarks of healthcare delivery in the post-reform era. Doctors argued that they receive more training than nurse practitioners and that care should be offered through a collaborative approach led by physicians.\n\nARNPs AND CRNAs MAKE A CASE FOR DERUGULATION\n\nJorge Valdes, president of the Florida Association of Nurse Anesthetists, told lawmakers during the hearing that members of his group have the training to provide anesthesia without physician supervision.\n\nAlso, backers of the changes say nurse practitioners, including specialists such as the nurse anesthetists, already provide services without doctors being present, though they have to get approval from physicians for what are known as \u201cprotocols\u201d that outline care.\n\n\u201cIn Florida, anesthesiology is delivered by both anesthesiologists and CRNAs \u201d Valdes said. \u201cI\u2019m a CRNA. I\u2019m a professional. I\u2019m not asking for anything additional than something I already do, (and that) is to practice my profession.\u201d\n\nHOUSE BILL CREATES TWO CATEGORIES OF CLINICAL AUTONOMY\n\nThe House bill, which will be discussed during a committee workshop Monday, would create two categories of nurse practitioners: \u201cindependent advanced practice registered nurses\u201d and \u201cadvanced practice registered nurses.\u201d\n\nThe advanced practice registered nurses would continue providing services under physician supervision, though they would receive additional authority to prescribe controlled substances. Nurse practitioners currently can prescribe other types of drugs, such as cholesterol medication or antibiotics.\n\nThe independent advanced practice registered nurses, including the specialists, would be able to provide services without supervision if they meet criteria for experience and pharmacology training. Along with being able to prescribe controlled substances, they would have authority to make a wide range of other decisions, such as admitting and discharging patients from hospitals.\n\nIMPETUS FOR BILL: PROJECTED INCREASED DEMAND FOR CARE\n\nPart of the impetus for the House taking up the issue is legislative leaders\u2019 concern about a combination of factors.\n\nNot only does the ACA\u2019s newly insured create a significant challenge to meeting the increased demands for healthcare, but a growing state population, aging baby-boomers and the fact that primary care practitioners are also aging and their ranks may not be adequately replenished also add to the impending primary care shortage.\n\nBoth the House and Senate are also considering other steps to address the issue of a primary care shortage, such as development and expansion of telemedicine, which has the potential to provide needed healthcare professional resources using the latest digital technology.\n\n\u201cAs we move into (the legislative) session, this committee will be proceeding with a bold initiative to expand access to care to Florida\u2019s workforce and to increase the competitiveness of that workforce market,\u201d select committee Chairman Jose Oliva (R-Miami Lakes) told the House panel last month.\n\nSENATE BILL DELAYS CHANGES AND EXCLUDES CRNAs\n\nSenate Health and Human Services Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Denise Grimsley (R-Sebring) said Thursday she is working on a bill that would make far less-dramatic changes than the House measure.\n\n\u201cThe Senate bill would not allow nurse practitioners to immediately work without physician supervision, though it would allow them to prescribe controlled substances,\u201d Grimsley said. \u201cThe bill likely will set a time in the future, possibly five years, when nurse practitioners could work independently if they meet criteria.\u201d However, she said her bill would not allow nurse anesthetists to work independently.\n\n\u201cThere is no compelling health care policy goal, realized financial incentive, or access to care reason to eliminate the nearly nationwide gold safety standard of anesthesia physician supervision,\u201d anesthesiologist Jay Epstein, president of the Florida Society of Anesthesiologists, said in a prepared statement Thursday.\n\nLEGISLATIVE FOCUS MUST BE SAFE, HIGH QUALITY CARE\n\nThe committee will continue to deliberate over the question: \u201cTo innovate, do we need to deregulate?\u201d The debate leading up to the regular session, which starts on March 4, will continue to hinge on what services that trained doctors and nurses in the appropriate settings can deliver to meet the increasing demands for primary care and ensure safe, high quality healthcare.\u201d\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "affordable care act,florida house of rrepresentatives,florida house select committee on healthcare work force innovation,florida medical association,florida ssociation of nurse anesthetists,primary care shortage,slider", "og": {"image": "http://spacecoastdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/pol_nurses11__01__630x420.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 1204082483, "app_id": 644760862318465}, "description": "On Monday the Florida House Select Committee on Healthcare Work Force Innovation will take up a controversial 155-page bill that would give nurse practitioners", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf465\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re against it (the House bill),\u201d Florida Medical Association General Counsel Jeff Scott said after reviewing the newly filed proposal Thursday.\nScott, said the new House bill is the broadest scope-of-practice expansion he has seen, and physician groups are already preparing to fight it.\nNurse practitioners currently can prescribe other types of drugs, such as cholesterol medication or antibiotics.\n\u201cThe Senate bill would not allow nurse practitioners to immediately work without physician supervision, though it would allow them to prescribe controlled substances,\u201d Grimsley said.\nThe independent advanced practice registered nurses, including the specialists, would be able to provide services without supervision if they meet criteria for experience and pharmacology training."}
