Carlos Uresti has often written about the future of DFPS. In a recent op-ed in the San Antonio Express News he called for improved standards now rather than waiting for this lawsuit to be resolved. Uresti joins us today to talk about what can be done.\n\nIn the seconds segment:\n\nYesterday Gov. Rick Perry directed the Texas Department of Insurance to regulate the new Federal Navigators program. The program was created by the Affordable Care Act in order to help citizens enroll in the new Health Exchange Programs.\n\nTexas State Representative Garnet Coleman (D-Houston) talks to us about what the regulations mean for the navigator programs in Texas.\n\nWe also talk with Jose Ibarra from Enroll America of Texas to talk about the questions they are getting from people, and the resources that exist for them.\n\n*The Source airs at 3 p.m. on KSTX 89.1 FM - audio from this show will be posted by 5:30 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Community", "description": "In the first segment: The State of Texas' Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) has seen many high-profile instances of neglect and abuse", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "The Source", "og": {"url": "http://tpr.org/post/source-uresti-foster-care-changes-aca-navigators-work-through-regulations", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kstx/files/styles/medium/public/201309/130918-source_0.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In the first segment: The State of Texas' Department of Family and Protective Services (DFPS) has seen many high-profile instances of neglect and abuse", "title": "The Source: Uresti On Foster Care Changes | ACA Navigators Work Through Regulations"}, "story_id": 223742600, "twitter": {"site": "@TPRNews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@tprsource"}, "author": "Paul Flahive", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "The Source: Uresti On Foster Care Changes | ACA Navigators Work Through Regulations"}, "nid": 18709, "datePublished": "2013-09-18", "keywords": "adoption, foster care, Carlos Uresti, Affordable Care Act", "wordCount": 396, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4020\"", "article_summary": "Texas State Representative Garnet Coleman (D-Houston) talks to us about what the regulations mean for the navigator programs in Texas.\nRick Perry directed the Texas Department of Insurance to regulate the new Federal Navigators program.\n*The Source airs at 3 p.m. on KSTX 89.1 FM - audio from this show will be posted by 5:30 p.m.\nThe program was created by the Affordable Care Act in order to help citizens enroll in the new Health Exchange Programs.\nSan Antonio state Sen.
