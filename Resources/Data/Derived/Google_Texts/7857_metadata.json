Charles Schumer wants to make the freeze permanent in Glens Falls factory visit\n\nGlens Falls\n\nLast week, Latham-based medical device maker AngioDynamics, Inc., signed a contract with an external research and development company.\n\nThe move funded a program to incorporate a new technology into the market, CEO Joseph DeVivo said Thursday.\n\nThis deal was finalized mere weeks after a freeze on a 2.3 percent tax on the sale of medical devices was signed into law.\n\nFreeing millions of dollars for jobs and research and development, the law enabled the company to make that deal six months to a year more quickly than it originally planned, DeVivo said.\n\nLegislation passed in December temporarily lifted a controversial tax that helped pay for the Affordable Care Act. Manufacturers and importers of medical devices, like AngioDynamics and others in the so-called Catheter Valley of upstate New York, have had to pay the tax on sales since 2013.\n\nDeVivo's announcement, which followed a tour of the Glens Falls facility with U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, was a bright moment Thursday for AngioDynamics, which on Thursday reported a second quarter net loss of $400,000, compared to last year's second-quarter earnings of $1.3 million. Net sales for the quarter were $89.2 million, compared to last year's $92.1 million. Additional information was not available by press time.\n\nAngioDynamics did not expect the legislation's success in Washington, DeVivo said.\n\n\"The probability of this happening \u2014 I don't think there was a betting man who said we could pull this off,\" he said.\n\nIndustry trade groups said the tax harmed research, development and continued medical progress. In the 12 months ending in May, the tax cost AngioDynamics $4.14 million. Since 2013, the company has spent more than $12 million from its operating budget on the tax, DeVivo said Thursday.\n\nHe said he expected the tax freeze to encourage manufacturing companies to launch products domestically instead of abroad.\n\nThe freeze runs until Dec. 31, 2017, and Schumer said the next step would be to eliminate the tax \u2014 which he said \"cut the industry off at its knees\".\n\n\"We're not going to rest at that \u2014 we're going to figure out a way to undo this tax permanently, because it's so important,\" Schumer said.\n\nSchumer said the freeze would not affect funding for the Affordable Care Act, though he did not specify how. The tax would have provided $29 billion for the Affordable Care Act from the device industry over a decade.\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, Schumer and DeVivo toured the company's new factory, where employees in a fluorescent-lit room assemble laser fiber catheters that treat varicose veins. The factory opened in January at the Glens Falls campus.\n\nlellis@timesunion.com \u2022 518-454-5018 \u2022 @lindsayaellis", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "Last week, Latham-based medical device maker AngioDynamics, Inc., signed a contract with an external research and development company.
