It is the largest such organization in the country.\n\nUnder state law, the Detroit Wayne Mental Health Authority has the task of integrating substance uses disorder programs into the mental health system, integrating its service with primary care providers to implement the Affordable Care Act and rebid the entire system of care before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cBasically this means we will put out a RFP (Request For Proposal) saying we have approximately $700 million available to purchase quality residential and therapeutic care for persons in need of mental health and substance use disorders,\u201d Watkins said.\n\nThe process to rebid of the mental health system contracts in Wayne County started in 2009 but was never completed.\n\nWatkins added, \u201cWhile we have a dedicated and strong provider network currently, the system has not been rebid in over a decade and can uses a tune-up.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of these hearings is to lay out a vision for the authority, seek ideas and input, and talk about the rebidding of contacts which will be done by the end of 2014.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to be a consumer and community focused, data-driven and evidence-based organization that strives to provide a broad array of supports and services to some of the most vulnerable people in our community with the highest quality care,\u201d Watkins said.\n\nUnable to attend the community forums?
