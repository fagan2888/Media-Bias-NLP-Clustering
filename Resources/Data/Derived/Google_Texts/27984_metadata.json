In other words, the court found once again that allowing a third-party insurer to provide birth control coverage to its employees and students does not violate Notre Dame\u2019s sincerely held beliefs.\n\nA brief refresher for those who have lost track of the dizzying number of Hobby Lobby-style challenges against the new healthcare law: the Affordable Care Act requires some employers to include comprehensive contraceptive coverage in insurance plans to employees. The coverage, like any other earned benefit, is part of a worker\u2019s wages. It isn\u2019t some gift from your super generous boss.\n\nBut there are exceptions. Churches and houses of worship don\u2019t have to comply, and religiously affiliated nonprofits don\u2019t have to directly provide coverage. Under the original accommodation, if a religiously affiliated nonprofit, like, say, Notre Dame, wanted to opt out of covering birth control, all it had to do was sign a form that would trigger a third-party insurer to pay for and provide the coverage. But many of these nonprofits argued that this accommodation wasn\u2019t sufficiently, uh, accommodating.\n\nWhich led to the Obama administration to introduce a \u201cfix\u201d in 2014 \u2014 an accommodation to the accommodation. Instead of filling out a form, the new policy allows these nonprofits to directly notify the Department of Health and Human Services of any religious objections they have to birth control and then HHS will arrange for the coverage.\n\nBut if you can believe it, Notre Dame stayed resolute in its challenge to the law, arguing that, even with the new accommodation, the law still violated its beliefs. It also, in effect, wanted the court to force the insurers providing contraceptive coverage to stop doing it. Because under Notre Dame\u2019s logic, doing anything at all that may result in people accessing birth control \u2014 even if it\u2019s just notifying the government that you have an objection or staying out of a business relationship between third-party insurers \u2014 is an undue burden.\n\nThe court didn\u2019t buy it. As the Wall Street Journal reported, in a 2-1 ruling, a three judge panel of the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago said that Notre Dame had failed to demonstrate why it was entitled to a preliminary injunction. It also found that the Obama administration had hit the correct balance between religious liberty and access with the accommodation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Notre Dame is trying to bar private insurers from doing business with students who want birth control coverage", "title": "Notre Dame\u2019s bogus birth control challenge smacked down: Federal court rejects university\u2019s bizarre claim", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Notre Dame is trying to bar private insurers from doing business with students who want birth control coverage", "title": "Notre Dame\u2019s bogus birth control challenge smacked down: Federal court rejects university\u2019s bizarre claim", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/20/notre_dames_bogus_birth_control_challenge_smacked_down_federal_court_rejects_universitys_bizarre_claim/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/bible_birth_control.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Notre Dame is trying to bar private insurers from doing business with students who want birth control coverage", "title": "Notre Dame\u2019s bogus birth control challenge smacked down: Federal court rejects university\u2019s bizarre claim", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/bible_birth_control.jpg", "creator": "@kmcdonovgh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katie McDonough", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Birth Control, Church and State, Hobby Lobby, religious liberty, Reproductive Rights", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9de1\"", "article_summary": "In other words, the court found once again that allowing a third-party insurer to provide birth control coverage to its employees and students does not violate Notre Dame\u2019s sincerely held beliefs.\nChurches and houses of worship don\u2019t have to comply, and religiously affiliated nonprofits don\u2019t have to directly provide coverage.\nCircuit Court of Appeals in Chicago said that Notre Dame had failed to demonstrate why it was entitled to a preliminary injunction.\nIt also found that the Obama administration had hit the correct balance between religious liberty and access with the accommodation.\nWhich led to the Obama administration to introduce a \u201cfix\u201d in 2014 \u2014 an accommodation to the accommodation."}
