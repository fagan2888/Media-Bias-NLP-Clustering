However, despite other cinematic efforts to tap the earlier November holiday, Thanksgiving still belongs solely to the John Hughes\u2019 1987 comedy masterpiece \u201cPlanes, Trains & Automobiles.\u201d While other movies (\u201cHome for the Holidays,\u201d \u201cAddams Family Values\u201d) have used the Turkey Day as a plot device, only \u201cPlanes\u201d can truly be said to be a \u201cThanksgiving movie\u201d in the truest sense of perfectly capturing not only the spirit of the day but also of forever tearing it away from any other film efforts. It is the only film I know of that everyone watches this time of year.\n\nChristmas gives filmmakers an excuse year after year to churn out (typically vapid) new attempts at separating moviegoers from their cash, but arguably the only film truly enshrined in the pantheon in the last 30 years was \u201cNational Lampoon\u2019s Christmas Vacation\u201d in 1989 \u2014 coincidentally, also written by Hughes. Several lists came out this week in various online forums of the \u201cbest\u201d Thanksgiving films. Unsurprisingly, \u201cPlanes\u201d topped them all; surprisingly, there were more films on those lists than I would have expected.\n\nSo why does \u201cPlanes, Trains & Automobiles\u201d still hold sway as both a classic comedy and retain its status as the ultimate Thanksgiving film nearly 30 years after its release? It enjoyed relatively modest box office for its day but found a cult following on VHS and became a Thanksgiving Eve tradition in many homes (mine included).\n\n\u201cPlanes\u201d is one of those comedies that is essentially perfect and, despite the passage of decades, seemingly does not age. The story of mismatched, uptight Neal Page (Steve Martin) and the crass-but-lovable Del Griffith (John Candy) trying to get back to Chicago for Thanksgiving is about as far from complicated as a script pitch could possibly be. Hughes (1950-2009) excelled at a certain brand of \u201880s comedies of efficiency. He directed only nine films in his career but wrote many, many more, including the \u201cVacation\u201d movies, \u201cHome Alone\u201d and \u201cMr. Mom.\u201d Typically his directorial efforts took place in a single day or two, had sharply defined characters, were always less than two hours and, in the best tradition of comedy, found ways to squeeze laughter not just out of humiliation \u2014 though that was certainly a part of it \u2014 but by forcing his characters into situations and company that all but guaranteed an explosion of hilarious proportions. The comedy came not from the story but from the characters\u2019 reactions to the plots, something writers of contemporary \u201cfunny\u201d films would do well to observe.\n\nThink of Mr. Martin\u2019s F-word-laced tirade about three-quarters of the way through \u201cPlanes.\u201d After suffering humiliation after humiliation, walking back from the car rental lot to St. Louis\u2019 Lambert Airport across a frozen highway and runway, Neal is met by a giggling, too-happy clerk (Edie McClurg, one of Hughes\u2019 regulars), whose face sours upon beholding the steaming Neal.\n\n\u201cWelcome to Marathon. May I help you?\u201d\n\nWhat follows is the film\u2019s most famous two minutes, in which Neal \u2014 heretofore so buttoned-up, desperately trying to smirk his way through adversity while clinging to his upper-middle-class notions of propriety \u2014 finally loses his mind and unleashes an angry, mean-spirited soliloquy at the clerk peppered by 18 (I counted) F-bombs.\n\nThat much profanity probably failed to shock even audiences of the day (or now), but it is the exact right script choice for the moment: Neal has come completely unglued, and circumstances have unleashed the primordial rage within that he works ever so hard to keep in check day by day as a suit-and-tie type.\n\nHughes understood that a well-placed curse word had the ability to both surprise and elicit laughter. Neal using the F-word even once would have been funny enough, but his dropping it as every other word for a full minute is nothing short of comedic transcendence. Though the film continues on for another 40 minutes, and more misery yet awaits Neal, the rental car scene is the ultimate apex of his fall from polite boardroom drone to scalding, ranting maniac, forced at last to fight at street level with the blue-collar folks he has treated previously as so far beneath him (and using \u201ctheir\u201d vernacular, no less). The moment is a humor masterpiece in and of itself, and Miss McClurg\u2019s brief-yet-firm response takes the wind out of his tempest with but two words \u2014 one of them, again, \u201cthat\u201d word.\n\nYes, the rant earned the R-rating in a film that otherwise would be fine for the whole family, but it is crucial to the film\u2019s success and to Neal\u2019s unraveling. To ever see \u201cPlanes, Trains & Automobiles\u201d on television, with either bleeps or substituted words, is nothing short of a crime against cinema. In a half-century career of brilliance, it is perhaps Mr. Martin\u2019s finest moment ever committed to film. (To put this into some personal perspective, it is the one scene my father, a virtual hate machine for anything Hollywood, insisted on being alerted to before it happened every Thanksgiving Eve.)\n\nThis is but one example of how perfect Hughes fashioned his film as both writer and director. Every scene works, every joke lands, not a moment of screen time is wasted. While there are pratfalls and pitfalls for certain, the laughter, the pathos, comes from the odd-couple relationship between Neal and Del. While much of the humor comes from their verbal sparring, Hughes accomplishes this as much with visual gags. Consider when Neal first recognizes Del at the airport as the thief who swiped his cab on Park Ave. during rush hour. Neal peers up from his issue of Fortune to spy Del reading a trashy stag book called \u201cThe Canadian Mounted.\u201d In that one throwaway moment Hughes has established not only a clash of personalities but one of class.\n\nThese two will be anything but friends. It is therefore required they spend the next 90 minutes together.\n\nHughes understood intrinsically that comedy is about victims, not perpetrators. We like and identify with Neal because he is continually victimized by Del\u2019s increasingly poor, if heartfelt, choices, and we like Del not just because he is the everyman so many of us are but because he has no one to blame for the morasses he creates but himself \u2014 a man as flawed as any of us.\n\nHughes applied this same axiom in \u201cFerris Bueller\u2019s Day Off.\u201d While yes, Ferris is unquestionably the hero of the piece, the film is really about Cameron (Alan Ruck) and his transformation from neurotic antisocial wreck to finding confidence by the story\u2019s end (that poor Ferrari!). Some of us are Ferrises, but most of us are Camerons. And while the school bureaucrat Edward Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) is indeed Ferris\u2019 nemesis, we like Rooney because, at the end of the day, he\u2019s right: Ferris is ditching, he knows it, we know it; Ferris must be held to account, but Rooney continually falls into Ferris\u2019 prefabricated traps. He\u2019s the superego to Ferris\u2019 id, seeking desperately to get the jack back in the box. Both Cameron and Rooney continually fall victim to Ferris\u2019 machinations, which produces the humor.\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "Several lists came out this week in various online forums of the \"best\" Thanksgiving films.
