President Obama celebrated Thursday morning's Supreme Court decision saving his signature health care law as "a good day for America." Speaking from the Rose Garden at the White House, the president said that if the decision had gone the other way "for many, insurance would have become unaffordable again, many would have become uninsured again, ultimately everyone's premiums could have gone up. America would have gone backwards. And that's not what we do, and that's not what America does. We move forward." Watch his full remarks above.
