Barbara Boxer, 74, will not be seeking a fifth term. Cliff Owen/AP\n\nToday in Obama:\n\nGrim Prognosis: With the White House preparing to simultaneously defend Obamacare on two fronts \u2013 the Supreme Court\u2019s going to hear a technical challenge to the law this term, while the Republican-majority Congress is trying to kill it through a thousand cuts \u2013 the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports that changing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s definition of full-time work would add $53 billion to the federal deficit and up to 1 million people to government-backed health insurance rolls, according to The Hill.\n\nDrawn Conclusion:\n\n\n\nSteve Breen/Creators Syndicate\n\nToday in 2016, Campaign Books Edition:\n\nGrits, Gravy and \u2013 Wait, What?!: In his new tome, \u201cGod, Guns, Grits and Gravy,\u201d potential Republican presidential contender and ex-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee talks culture, which means topics like Jay Z, gay marriage and the fact that there\u2019s poverty in America. U.S. News\u2019 Dave Catanese reports the book has a few surprises \u2013 a finger-wag at the Club for Growth and a hat-tip to former Democratic Sen. John Edwards \u2013 but the biggest eye-popper is Huckabee\u2019s rant at airport security in a chapter titled, \u201cBend Over and Take It Like a Prisoner.\u201d\n\n\n\n[MORE: A Different Kind of Service in Congress]\n\nDoctored: Retired neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson, another potential 2016 Republican presidential contender, apologized Thursday after BuzzFeed News discovered he\u2019d plagiarized parts of his top-selling book, \u201cAmerica the Beautiful.\u201d Carson apparently lifted passages from sources including a conservative historian, CBS News, a Liberty Institute press release and a now-defunct website. Not a good look for the doctor, but at least irony is with him: BuzzFeed fired an editor last year after they found he\u2019d plagiarized more than 40 times.\n\nToday in Everything Else:\n\nMust-See TV: In announcing she will retire after 24 years in office, Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat with a reputation for the unorthodox, eschewed the standard \u2013 i.e., boring \u2013 press release or press conference. Instead, she created what seems more like video performance art by posting on YouTube a video of her eldest grandson \u2013 a young man clad in shorts and a black shirt \u2013 interviewing her (\u201cGrandma, have you made a decision regarding the 2016 Senate race?\u201d) in order to preempt those pesky reporters.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more: Boxer, a published novelist, also wrote a poem to say farewell, an eight-line ode to her years on Capitol Hill. Even though she\u2019s got two more years left in her term, she says:\n\nThe Senate is the place where I've always made my case,\n\nFor families, for the planet, and the human race.\n\nMore than 20 years in the job I love,\n\nThanks to California and the Lord above\n\nSo although I won't be working for my Senate space,\n\nAnd I won't be running in that next tough race,\n\nAs long as there are issues and challenges and strife,\n\nI will never retire because that's the meaning of my life.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Last Call: Barbara Boxer Waxes Poetic, Mike Huckabee Fires Back", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The California senator is calling it quits, while the former Arkansas governor is calling people out.", "title": "Last Call: Boxer Waxes Poetic, Huckabee Hits Back", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2015/01/08/last-call-barbara-boxer-waxes-poetic-mike-huckabee-fires-back", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/31/2e/360d0c0a48eb958d9c1293d6ed0e/150108-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The California senator is calling it quits, while the former Arkansas governor is calling people out.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Last Call: Barbara Boxer Waxes Poetic, Mike Huckabee Fires Back"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Jan. 8, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Joseph P.
