They identified themselves as partners at the new fund.\n\nMeteorologist Adam Stevens is the fourth analyst from Velite to join Timoneer, energy news portal Sparkspread reported on Thursday.\n\nTimoneer Energy's website appears to be under construction, and the four could not be reached for comment. A spokesman for Velite did not immediately return a call for comment.\n\nKing had been with Velite since its inception in 2006, his LinkedIn page showed. He gave his position as portfolio manager.\n\nNaehr worked there for nearly 6-1/2 years, performing risk and fundamentals analysis. He was previously with Citigroup, doing quantitative research in energy trading.\n\nSurana was with Velite for two years, and had been an associate in trading of natural gas options and power at Credit Suisse.\n\nNo details were available on Stevens.\n\nVelite, founded by gas market veteran David Coolidge, is one of the best performing hedge funds in the energy market. It has posted double digit gains in many years when its peers stumbled. Last year, Velite returned more than 30 percent, Sparkspread said, quoting sources.\n\nThe number of Houston-based hedge funds run by veteran natural gas traders such as Coolidge has dwindled in recent years because of tough market conditions.\n\nFormer Enron trader John Arnold retired nearly three years ago. SandRidge Capital's Andy Rowe quit in 2013. Anthony Annunziato said last December he was closing his AAA Capital Management fund.\n\nConnecticut-based Sasco Energy, previously run by Sempra veteran Todd Esse, went out of business last year.\n\n(Reporting By Barani Krishnan.
