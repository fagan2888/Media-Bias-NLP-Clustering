For one, a study found playing Tetris for an hour and a half a week for three months thickened player\u2019s cerebral cortex; other parts of the brain, too, became more efficient. Hill, however, added changes in brain structure doesn\u2019t necessarily mean changes in brain function. These changes could also occur if someone plays, say, Mario Kart for the same amount of time.\n\nA separate study showed playing Tetris can reduce the amount of flashbacks people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder experience. After participants were shown traumatic film clips, half of them were assigned to play Tetris while the other half sat quietly. Researchers monitored participants' flashbacks for a week and found those who did not play Tetris had twice as many flashbacks compared to those who did play, suggesting the game acts as a \u201ccognitive vaccine.\u201d\n\nOf course, Tetris can also be addictive. Warren explained it naturally appeals to a person\u2019s natural desire to organize, allowing the player to think with the game, which makes it easier to be consumed by it during \u201cnon-gaming hours.\u201d\n\nFor now, both Hill and Warren conclude, science can't for sure say the game is good or bad \u2014 so feel free to keep playing in moderation.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "tetris, may, make, brain, more, efficient, act, cognitive, vaccine, mental, health, disorders", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A deeper look at what goes on in our brain when we stack these classic, colorful blocks.", "title": "Could Tetris Actually Boost Brain Power?
