Professor Matthew Sutton reports that the evangelical movement \u201cnow claims almost 30 per cent of the US population (Catholics represent about 23 per cent and liberal Protestants about 14 per cent)\u201d. Presumably the remaining third are of various affiliations or none.\n\nIn another sentence, Prof Sutton calls the evangelicals \u201cfundamentalists\u201d. Fundamentalists began on the margins of American religious life, where they represented a schismatic alternative to mainstream Christianity. Their evangelical descendants now oversee what is arguably the most powerful religious movement in the United States and one of the most powerful around the globe.\n\nTo begin where Prof Sutton begins, in the later years of the 19th century, many \u201cradical evangelicals\u201d, who thought of themselves as \u201cBaptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Pentecostals\u201d, began preaching from pulpits, in schools, advocacy groups, magazines and newspapers. These preachers \u2013 nearly all white men \u2013 supposedly believed that they and the people they addressed were living in the Last Days; that they would witness the Second Coming of Christ, who would separate sheep from goats, reward the good and punish the wicked; and that the future would be as Peter prophesied in his second Epistle, chapter 3, verse 10:\n\n\u201cBut the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.\n\nTo soften this threat, there is the promise of second Chronicles, chapter 7 verse 14, the Lord to Solomon:\n\n\u201cIf my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.\u201d\n\nMore ambiguously, there is the Gospel according to Luke, chapter 19, verse 13:\n\n\u201cAnd he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.\u201d Occupy what? Themselves, keeping themselves busy? Or occupy the world, take charge of it, for the love of God?\n\nSaying the right thing\n\nIn 1954 Congress added the words \u201cunder God\u201d to the Pledge of Allegiance and in 1956, to make doubly sure, made \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d the national motto. President Ronald Reagan\u2019s description of the Soviet Union as an \u201cevil empire\u201d fulfilled the appropriate logic. If you believed that it was the \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d of the US to be exceptionally righteous, then you might as well have the Soviet Union as the Antichrist.\n\nProf Sutton presents modern evangelicalism mainly through its most formidable preachers, the men who took full advantage of the media, especially radio and television when they became available, and books till then.\n\nDepraved state\n\nHe could afford a smile. But if you add to evangelical insistences the privilege of self-reliance, a quality much lauded by Ralph Waldo Emerson and other American sages, you find it easy to understand, if not to appreciate, the virulent opposition to President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act and the spleen occasioned by any suggestion of a welfare state. \u201cTrust thyself,\u201d Emerson writes, \u201cevery heart vibrates to that iron string.\u201d\n\nRegular outbreaks of social Darwinism in American politics are hard for foreigners to witness: it seems obvious to them that the millions of Americans who live \u2013 exist , rather \u2013 below the poverty line must be looked after since they can\u2019t enjoy the felicity of looking after themselves.\n\nThen again, Emerson writes in Self-Reliance: \u201cDo not tell me, as a good man did today, of my obligation to put all poor men in good situations. Are they my poor? I tell thee, thou foolish philanthropist, that I grudge the dollar, the dime, the cent I give to such men as do not belong to me and to whom I do not belong.\u201d\n\nPreachers from Billy Sunday to Billy Graham and Jerry Falwell bring intimations of spirituality to their readers and audiences, but mainly they bring the shared experience of celebrity to people who are already converted. According to Prof Sutton: \u201cA 2006 Pew poll revealed that 79 per cent of US Christians believed in the Second Coming and 20 per cent expected it to happen in their lifetime.\u201d About 50 per cent of Americans have read some of the Bible during the past year; of these, more than a third claimed that they read it \u201cto learn about the future\u201d.\n\nBilly Graham, in the latest edition of his Storm Warning, writes: \u201cNow at ninety-one years old, I believe the storm clouds are darker than they have ever been . . . Benevolent hands reach down from heaven to offer us the most hopeful warning and remedy: \u2018Prepare to meet your God\u2019 . . . The signs of His imminent return have never been greater than now.\u201d\n\nProf Sutton brings to these strange episodes of American culture a proper degree of attentiveness and patience, with only a rare glint of irony breaking through.\n\nDenis Donoghue\u2019s most recent book is Metaphor (Harvard University Press)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Review: Assessing the prevalence of modern evangelicalism in the United States", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom12052975"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "Review: Assessing the prevalence of modern evangelicalism in the United States", "title": "American Apocalypse by  Matthew Sutton: The power of the preachers", "url": "http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/american-apocalypse-by-matthew-sutton-the-power-of-the-preachers-1.2052975", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.2052973.1420203226!/image/image.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 540}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Review: Assessing the prevalence of modern evangelicalism in the United States", "title": "American Apocalypse by  Matthew Sutton: The power of the preachers", "url": "http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/american-apocalypse-by-matthew-sutton-the-power-of-the-preachers-1.2052975", "image": "http://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.2052973.1420203226!/image/image.jpg", "site": "@IrishTimesBooks", "card": "summary", "account_id": 15084853}, "robots": "all", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "news_keywords": "Culture, Books, Book Review"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e8a\"", "article_summary": "In another sentence, Prof Sutton calls the evangelicals \u201cfundamentalists\u201d.\nBook Title:American Apocalypse A History of Modern Evangelicalism ISBN-13:978-0674048362 Author:Matthew Avery Sutton Publisher:Belknap Press Guideline Price:\u00a325.95Most Americans, I would have thought, were liberal Protestants, but apparently not.\nFundamentalists began on the margins of American religious life, where they represented a schismatic alternative to mainstream Christianity.\nProfessor Matthew Sutton reports that the evangelical movement \u201cnow claims almost 30 per cent of the US population (Catholics represent about 23 per cent and liberal Protestants about 14 per cent)\u201d.\nProf Sutton presents modern evangelicalism mainly through its most formidable preachers, the men who took full advantage of the media, especially radio and television when they became available, and books till then."}
