On Oct. 2, she reported that $4.13 million in operating cost reductions had been identified. The proposal assumes a 1% annual increase in property tax revenues over the four-year period.\n\nCommissioners asked a wide range of questions, and debated the merits of a four-year budget. Questions focused on the general fund reserves, changes in employment policy related to the federal Affordable Care Act, support for nonprofits, potential bonding for pension and retiree health care obligations, and proposed staff reductions.\n\nUltimately, the board voted to postpone initial action on the budget until its Oct. 16 meeting. A public hearing on the budget is also set for Oct. 16.\n\nTwo other items on the Oct. 2 agenda related to the Washtenaw County road commission: (1) the appointment of Barb Fuller to fill a vacant road commissioner seat; and (2) the creation of a new subcommittee to look at possible changes to the road commission. The vote on Fuller\u2019s appointment was postponed, when Dan Smith (R-District 2) raised questions about whether the previous road commissioner, Ken Schwartz, had officially resigned. The appointment will likely be made on Oct. 16.\n\nThe subcommittee item drew some controversy following a proposal by Conan Smith (D-District 9) to amend the resolution, adding a $10,000 budget for possible research costs. Andy LaBarre (D-District 7) objected, arguing that amending in $10,000 late in the meeting \u201cdoesn\u2019t look good and isn\u2019t needed.\u201d He also noted that another recently appointed committee \u2013 to develop recommendations for the county\u2019s Platt Road property \u2013 did not receive funding. The board eventually voted to create the road commission subcommittee with the $10,000 budget and in-kind support as needed, over dissent from LaBarre and Kent Martinez-Kratz (D-District 1).\n\nFinal approvals were given to a micro loan program for small businesses, and to a new way to pay off debt incurred from bonding, typically for public works projects in local municipalities. In other action, the board gave initial approval to an increase in the tax that supports services for indigent veterans, with a final vote set for Oct. 16. Also scheduled for Oct. 16 are four public hearing on the following topics: (1) the proposed 2014-2017 budget; (2) an increase to the Act 88 tax for economic development and agriculture; (3) a proposed ordinance that would allow the county to issue municipal civil infractions for owning an unlicensed dog; and (4) a proposed brownfield plan by the Chelsea Milling Co., makers of Jiffy Mix.\n\nDuring public commentary, the board heard from a representative of the Michigan Association of Counties, which represents 81 of the 83 counties in Michigan \u2013 but not Washtenaw County. The board eliminated annual MAC dues from its budget for 2012 and 2013. Some commissioners are interested in rejoining the organization.\n\nBut public commentary was dominated by supporters of Michigan\u2019s \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d law, responding to plans by Yousef Rabhi (D-District 8) to bring forward a resolution urging the state legislature to repeal that law. That resolution was not on the Oct. 2 agenda. Many of the speakers were from outside of Washtenaw County, and wore sidearms to the meeting.\n\nThe board also spent about 30 minutes debating how to handle its agenda briefings. In the current approach, briefings take place a half-hour prior to the board\u2019s bi-monthly working sessions \u2013 and almost two weeks before the subsequent board meeting. As a result, very few agenda items are ready when the briefing occurs. Over dissent by Ronnie Peterson (D-District 6), the board voted to eliminate those briefings. Instead, agenda packets will be emailed to commissioners a week prior to their board meetings. Rabhi, the current board chair, indicated his intent to include public input into the agenda-setting process in some way.\n\nThe Oct. 2 meeting coincided with the birthday of Alicia Ping (R-District 2), and commissioners helped her celebrate by singing a somewhat subdued rendition of \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d just before a break in the proceedings.\n\n2014-2017 Budget\n\nDuring the Oct. 2 meeting, Washtenaw County administrator Verna McDaniel and the county\u2019s finance staff presented a four-year general fund budget to county commissioners, for the years 2014-2017. The $103,005,127 million budget for 2014 was on the agenda for initial approval. It represents a slight decrease from the 2013 expenditures of $103,218,903.\n\nThe proposal calls for putting a net total of 8.47 full-time-equivalent jobs on \u201chold vacant\u201d status, as well as the net reduction of a 0.3 FTE position.\n\nThe recommended budgets for the following years are $103,977,306 in 2015, $105,052,579 in 2016, and $106,590,681 in 2017. The budgets are based on an estimated 1% annual increase in property tax revenues. [.pdf of draft budget summary]\n\nMcDaniel had previously indicated that the county would need to find $3.9 million in structural savings in 2014. On Oct. 2, she reported that $4.13 million in operating cost reductions had been identified. Those include: (1) $2.89 million in proposed departmental reductions; (2) $688,000 in estimated increased revenues from fees and services, (3) $450,000 in reductions to county infrastructure allocations, and (4) $100,000 in cuts to \u201coutside agency\u201d allocations.\n\nAmong the recommended departmental reductions, $819,000 is estimated to come from putting eight positions in the sheriff\u2019s office on hold-vacant status. Another $1.1 million is expected to come from health insurance premium-sharing.\n\nThe outside agency reductions include decreasing the annual amount for mandated animal control services \u2013 paid to the Humane Society of Huron Valley \u2013 from $500,000 to $470,000. According to the county\u2019s financial staff, the $30,000 difference will be made up from revenues contributed to HSHV by other local government units in the county.\n\nAnother $30,000 in cuts comes from the allocation to the Barrier Busters program \u2013 from $120,000 in 2013 to $90,000 in 2014. The budget calls for cutting that allocation to $50,000 in each of the following three years.\n\nThis year, the county is supporting the Delonis Center homeless shelter in Ann Arbor with $51,230 from the general fund budget. In 2014, that amount will increase to $160,000, then subsequently increase to $200,000 in each of the following three years. The county is counting the $40,000 difference between the 2014 budget and the 2015-2017 budgets as a \u201csavings\u201d in 2014 because the county, prior to 2012, had supported the center at $200,000 annually.\n\nThere are also several proposed changes to the county\u2019s budget policies. Highlights include:\n\npreparing the budget in four-year cycles, rather than the previous two-year periods.\n\nincreasing the amount of a professional services contract that triggers the need for board notification from $25,000 to $50,000.\n\nadding a provision to give commissioners a seven-day period in which to review any contract over $150,000.\n\nincreasing the target of the general fund\u2019s fund balance from 8% to 20% of general fund expenditures.\n\nIn her portion of the budget presentation, finance analyst Tina Gavalier reminded commissioners that the budget is based on a range of factors, including 10-year agreements with most of the county\u2019s labor unions that the board approved earlier this year. Conversations are beginning for new contracts with bargaining units of the Police Officers Association of Michigan (POAM) and Command Officers Association of Michigan (COAM), she said.\n\nCurrent outstanding debt is just over $26 million. Assuming that the county doesn\u2019t incur additional debt, that amount will fall below $5 million by 2023, Gavalier said, and will be paid off entirely by 2032.\n\nMcDaniel reviewed the board\u2019s budget priorities, which she said helped guide development of the budget. She noted that the largest source of revenue comes from property taxes, accounting for 62% of the budget. Looking ahead, the major assumption is that property taxes will stabilize, with 1% increase in the growth of taxable value each year from 2014 through 2017. Projections include personal property tax revenue of $5.5 million in 2014, although there\u2019s some uncertainty beyond that, because the tax will be phased out through 2022. As part of that change, a statewide voter referendum is slated for August 2014 to ask voters to authorize replacement funds from other state revenue sources. It\u2019s unclear what will happen if that voter referendum fails.\n\nMcDaniel said the budget also assumes that the state will maintain the incentive program that replaced state-revenue sharing, for $5.5 million annually. This approach requires the county to \u201cjump through hoops\u201d to get the funding, she said, but the county has managed to meet the state\u2019s requirements. Under the previous state revenue-sharing approach, the county received about $6.8 million annually.\n\nOn the expenditure side, the largest item is personnel, at 67% of expenditures. Assumptions in the upcoming budget take into account terms of the labor agreements, McDaniel said, and include a 6% annual increase for fringe benefits. She highlighted the fact that the budget results in a net reduction of 0.3 FTE, plus 8.4 positions on hold-vacant status. It was difficult, but the budget accomplished the goal of \u201cnot devastating staff with these reductions,\u201d McDaniel said.\n\nA public hearing on the budget is set for Oct. 16, with final board approval likely on Nov. 20.\n\n2014-2017 Budget: Board Discussion \u2013 Fund Balance\n\nConan Smith (D-District 9) referred to the budget policies, which states a revised target of increasing the general fund reserves from 8% to 20% of the general fund budget. He noted that in reality, the reserves are currently at about 16%. He clarified with the finance staff that \u201creserves\u201d and \u201cfund balance\u201d are used interchangeably, and refer to the same figure. Smith suggested using a consistent term throughout the budget documents, to avoid confusion.\n\nMcDaniel pointed out that the beginning fund balance on Jan. 1, 2014 is expected to be $16.457 million. By the end of 2017, that balance is projected to stand at $17.91 million.\n\nC. Smith wondered why the administration is recommending a target of 20%. McDaniel replied that there are two reasons. One is for cash flow purposes. The county gets its largest amount of property taxes in July and August, after the summer taxes are levied in July. So for the first half of the year, the administration uses the general fund reserves to help pay its bills, without borrowing from the reserves of other county departments. That kind of internal borrowing is not a good practice, she said.\n\nC. Smith asked where the additional funds would come from, in order to build up the reserves to 20%. McDaniel said that any budget surpluses would be used for that purpose.\n\nDan Smith (R-District 2) highlighted a budget summary chart, which showed that a line item for \u201cother revenue\u201d increased significantly from 2016 to 2017. [.pdf of budget summary chart. The line item is $1.879 million in 2016, and $2.327 million in 2017 \u2013 or about a $450,000 increase.] Tina Gavalier explained that it reflects a planned use of fund balance (reserves) in 2017.\n\n2014-2017 Budget: Board Discussion \u2013 Discretionary Authorization\n\nConan Smith asked about some changes to the budget policies related to the county administrator\u2019s ability to authorize contracts for goods, services, new construction or renovation. Currently, for amounts over $100,000, the administrator must notify the board in writing of the proposed contract. If no commissioner objects within seven business days, the administrator can sign the contract. The proposed policy change clarifies that the $100,000 relates to the total contract amount per year, and adds that the same process must be followed for multi-year contracts over $150,000.\n\nIn addition, the proposed policy calls for changing the trigger for board notification on professional services contracts from those that exceed $25,000 to contracts that exceed $50,000. C. Smith asked for an explanation of that, too.\n\nCurtis Hedger, the county\u2019s corporation counsel, explained that these were his recommendations. It\u2019s been about 10 years since these policies were put in place, and there\u2019s some uncertainty about when the board notification requirement should be triggered. Regarding the change for professional services contracts, Hedger said there aren\u2019t many of these that come through. He said he could live with keeping it at $25,000 if that\u2019s what commissioners would prefer.\n\n2014-2017 Budget: Board Discussion \u2013 Affordable Care Act\n\nConan Smith asked about a new item in the budget policy:\n\n16. To be in compliance with federal health care reform and the Affordable Care Act effective 1-1-14, the Board of Commissioners reaffirms Resolution #13-TBD that part time employees are not permitted to work more than 25 hours per week. Any part time employee hired, shall not work more than 25 hours per week.\n\nDiane Heidt, the county\u2019s human resources and labor relations director, responded. She explained that the county has two types of part-time employees \u2013 those with benefits, and those without. If you\u2019re a part-time employee working between 50% to 79% of a full-time job, you\u2019re in a position with benefits and can buy health insurance through the county at a reduced cost. If you are working less than 50%, the county doesn\u2019t offer health insurance. People in about 30-35 part-time positions have access to benefits \u2013 those in the 50-79% range, she said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires the county to offer health insurance to anyone who works 30 hours or more per week during a specified period. It doesn\u2019t mean that the employee has to buy the health insurance, Heidt explained, but the county must offer it. This will affect primarily the parks & recreation staff, sheriff\u2019s office, the water resources commissioner, and the community support & treatment services (CSTS) unit \u2013 units that use more part-time employees.\n\nHeidt said the administration plans to bring forward a resolution to the board setting this policy, possibly in November. The intent is to remind departments about the potential liability of employees who work for more than 30 hours per week.\n\nIn response to another query from C. Smith, Heidt clarified that the nine county commissioners are considered part-time employees with benefits, and they would continue to have access to health insurance offered by the county.\n\nC. Smith asked the staff to provide information about the potential financial impact of this change. He asked the administration to reconsider whether the policy needed to be part of the budget resolution.\n\nYousef Rabhi (D-District 8) said he had serious concerns about this item, and didn\u2019t know whether he could support it. He asked whether the county was following its living wage ordinance. When Heidt replied that temporary workers are exempt from the living wage ordinance, Rabhi indicated that he disagreed with that policy. He said he understands the budgetary impact, but felt it\u2019s the right thing to do.\n\n2014-2017 Budget: Board Discussion \u2013 Coordinated Funding, Nonprofit Support\n\nConan Smith asked for clarification about the amount budgeted for coordinated funding. By way of background, \u201ccoordinated funding\u201d refers to an approach for supporting local human services nonprofits, by coordinating the allocation of funds from five partners: Washtenaw County, the city of Ann Arbor, United Way of Washtenaw County, Washtenaw Urban County, and the Ann Arbor Area Community Foundation. The program, administered by the county\u2019s office of community & economic development (OCED), began as a two-year pilot project. In November 2012 it was extended for an additional year.\n\nTina Gavalier of the county\u2019s finance staff told C. Smith that the proposed budget calls for $1.015 million to coordinated funding each year. That\u2019s the same amount as the current allocation. In addition, a resolution will be brought to the board on Oct. 16 to extend the coordinated funding program another two years.\n\nIn other question related to the OCED budget, Andy LaBarre (D-District 7) noted that the department\u2019s budget is slated to be $14.716 million in 2014, but drops over the years to $12.588 million by 2017. He wondered if that reflected the county\u2019s priorities, or whether it was due to projected decreases in federal and state funding.\n\nVerna McDaniel indicated that the decrease was attributed to federal and state cuts, not a decrease in general fund support.\n\nDan Smith pointed to the funding for the Delonis Center homeless shelter. He noted that it was presented as a savings in 2014, when in fact the line item increases from $51,230 this year to $160,000 in 2014. It seemed to him that the amount for the Delonis Center was increasing 110%.\n\nMcDaniel said that prior to the 2012-2013 budget cycle, the county was supporting the center at $200,000 annually. That amount was cut dramatically for 2012 and 2013 \u2013 to $25,000 each year \u2013 with an agreement that funding would be reinstated in 2014. The center subsequently got another $26,000 in 2012 and 2013, when the board voted to eliminate its dues to the Michigan Association of Counties, and shifted those funds to the Delonis Center instead.\n\nBut rather than reinstitute the full $200,000 in 2014, McDaniel said she asked again for a $40,000 cut in order to fund Barrier Busters. The Delonis Center administration agreed to that, she said, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s reflected as a savings.\n\nD. Smith asked whether the agreement that McDaniel referred to was something the board had voted on. McDaniel indicated that it was negotiated between the county and the center, like similar negotiations with other nonprofits that receive county support.\n\nD. Smith pointed out that the county isn\u2019t mandated to provide funding to the homeless shelter. In contrast, the board has stated that public safety and justice is a priority, he said, but there\u2019s a proposed $25,000 reduction in the prosecuting attorney\u2019s office. That\u2019s a mandated service, he noted.\n\n2014-2017 Budget: Board Discussion \u2013 Retiree Benefits, Bonding\n\nConan Smith asked the administration to describe the budget impact of closing the county\u2019s defined benefit plan for retirees. [The county, as part of negotiating new labor contracts earlier this year, is closing its Washtenaw County Employees\u2019 Retirement System (WCERS) and Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association (VEBA) plans to employees hired after Jan. 1, 2014.]\n\nCounty administrator Verna McDaniel replied that she had originally expected the cost to be much higher. However, now the estimate is about $2 million annually.\n\nC. Smith noted that Oakland County recently made a major bond issuance to cover its unfunded pension and retiree health care obligations. The bond market is strong, he said, and pursuing the bonding strategy that the Washtenaw County board previously discussed would have a dramatic impact on the availability of funds for other programs and services. \u201cI still want to do it,\u201d he said.\n\n[By way of background, the bond initiative, publicly proposed in May 2013, was intended to cover unfunded pension and retiree healthcare obligations for WCERS and VEBA. The original maximum amount for the bonds had been estimated at up to $345 million. But updated actuarial data resulted in a lower estimate of about $295 million. However, on July 3, McDaniel and board chair Yousef Rabhi issued a joint statement announcing a decision hold off on any bond-related action. No date has been set to reschedule action, if any, on the proposal. For additional background, see Chronicle coverage: \"County to Push Back Vote on Bond Proposal.\"]\n\nDan Smith pointed out that there\u2019s very little mention in the proposed budget of the county\u2019s unfunded liabilities, which the board had spent considerable time discussing earlier this year. How the county decides to handle that will affect the budget, he noted, and he wondered what the projections are for contributions needed from the general fund reserves.\n\nMcDaniel replied by saying \u201cthat\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess, I presume.\u201d The answer will be clearer when the county gets its actuarial report from Buck Consultants next year, she added. The market has not been kind, she said, but with a five-year \u201csmoothing\u201d approach, the year 2008 \u2013 when the market plummeted \u2013 will fall off from those smoothing calculations next year. That should be helpful to stabilize the county\u2019s contributions to its unfunded liabilities, she said.\n\nMcDaniel also pointed out that she had recommended bonding for the full amount of those liabilities, noting that the board had decided not to pursue that approach.\n\n2014-2017 Budget: Board Discussion \u2013 Staff Reductions, Hold Vacant Status\n\nAndy LaBarre said it\u2019s good that the proposed budget reductions don\u2019t decimate the staff. But at some point, he wanted the administration to explain how they were able to arrive at only eliminating a net 0.3 FTE, when the original projections for staff cuts had been significantly higher.\n\nDan Smith said it was very disturbing that there were 8 FTE positions on hold vacant status in the sheriff\u2019s office. He asked county administrator Verna McDaniel to elaborate. She reported that she had asked for a much higher reduction from the sheriff Jerry Clayton, but compromised on a proposed reduction of $819,000. The sheriff\u2019s office accounts for more of the general fund budget than any other department in the county, she added. The sheriff has been a team player, McDaniel said, but he\u2019s very concerned about the serviceability levels. She said she understands that concern.\n\nD. Smith also asked about the proposed reduction in contract deputies, from 81 to 79. McDaniel explained that the number of contract deputy positions depends on whether other municipalities contract with the sheriff\u2019s office for those services. It\u2019s separate from the 8 FTEs that will be put on hold vacant status.\n\nConan Smith noted that last year, there also had been 8 FTE positions put on hold vacant status in the sheriff\u2019s department. He clarified with McDaniel that the proposed 8 FTEs in the new budget would be in addition to those previous 8 FTEs. So the sheriff\u2019s office would be down 16 FTEs compared to two years ago. McDaniel said that a lot of new positions were created when the jail expanded, but there wasn\u2019t sufficient funding to fill them all.\n\nD. Smith told McDaniel that the hold vacant approach is confusing. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to reduce the position, we should reduce the position \u2013 eliminate it and be done with it. We seem to have no trouble creating new positions at some point later when we want to.\u201d McDaniel replied that departments want to be able to move quickly to fill positions if funding becomes available. D. Smith noted that the board meets twice a month during most of the year, so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem to get approval very quickly. He pointed out that the county supposedly has a hiring freeze, yet departments can fill positions that are on hold vacant status without board approval.\n\n2014-2017 Budget: Board Discussion \u2013 Four-Year Budget\n\nDan Smith asked about the 1% annual revenue increase, and wondered how that was calculated. Verna McDaniel explained that it was made in consultation with the equalization department \u2013 which oversees tax assessments \u2013 as well as the treasurer, clerk and finance staff. She characterized it as a very conservative estimate.\n\nD. Smith described the economy as still very volatile. Being off even a fraction of a percentage would have a real impact on the budget. He didn\u2019t think the county could accurately project out four years, especially given recent history. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through unprecedented times,\u201d he said, and it\u2019s concerning to make projections so far out.\n\nD. Smith said he continued to be leery of a four-year budget. Strictly speaking, it doesn\u2019t tie the hands of future commissioners because the budget must be approved each year. However, a four-year budget makes a lot of explicit commitments, and that\u2019s very concerning to him.\n\nSome people point to Oakland County, which uses a three-year budget cycle, D. Smith said. But that county has a different form of government, he noted, with a county executive who\u2019s elected and who has equal authority with the commissioners. In Washtenaw County, the appointed county administrator doesn\u2019t have veto authority over the board. He didn\u2019t think Oakland County provided a good comparison.\n\nD. Smith also thought that a four-year budget put a burden on countywide elected officials, who are asked to prepare a four-year budget when in some cases they\u2019ve only been in office a very short time. He gave the example of Evan Pratt, the new water resources commissioner who took office in January 2013.\n\nD. Smith suggested working toward a four-year budget incrementally, by first adopting a two-year budget with an additional two years as projections. He also suggested shifting the four-year period to give the countywide elected officials a year in office before needing to develop their budgets. [Countywide officials \u2013 the sheriff, clerk, treasurer, prosecuting attorney and water resources commissioner \u2013 are elected to four-year terms by all residents of the county. The most recent election occurred in 2012. County commissioners are elected to two-year terms by the residents in their districts.]\n\nRonnie Peterson (D-District 6) said he didn\u2019t support a four-year budget. There are some challenging years ahead, he said, and adjustments will be necessary.\n\nConan Smith weighed in, saying he loved the four-year budget process, but he\u2019s uncomfortable about adopting a four-year budget. If a four-year budget is adopted, there would be a strong tendency to stick with it, he said. So if the board adopts a four-year budget, he wanted to feel really good about the investments that the county will be making.\n\nYousef Rabhi called the four-year budget a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d Government in the past has been very short-sighted, he said, and this is an opportunity to change that. \u201cWe have the opportunity to lead, and I think we should take that opportunity with the four-year budget,\u201d he said. Rabhi added that he appreciated the concerns expressed by other commissioners, and thought there\u2019s more work to do in determining the community outcomes that the board wants to see. He asked the administration to be explicit about how the outcomes that the board determines will be incorporated into the budget.\n\nThe budget is a living document, Rabhi said. It evolves over time, and the board has the opportunity every year \u2013 and at any time \u2013 to change it, based on priorities and outcomes. He supports the concept of a four-year budget, which he said has the potential to be transformative and ground-breaking.\n\n2014-2017 Budget: Board Discussion \u2013 Postponement\n\nDan Smith moved to postpone the initial vote on the budget until Oct. 16.\n\nOutcome: Commissioners unanimously voted to postpone an initial vote on the budget until Oct. 16.\n\nRoad Commission\n\nTwo items on the Oct. 2 agenda related to the Washtenaw County road commission: (1) the appointment of Barb Fuller to fill a vacant road commissioner seat; and (2) the creation of a new subcommittee to look at possible changes to the road commission.\n\nCurrently, the road commission \u2013 overseen by three road commissioners \u2013 is a semi-autonomous entity that handles the maintenance of about 1,650 miles of roads in the county that are outside of cities and villages, including about 770 miles of gravel roads. Road commissioners are appointed by the county board of commissioners, an elected body, but decisions made by the road commission do not require authorization by the county board.\n\nIn the past, county commissioners have discussed the possibility of expanding the three-member road commission, in part because its small size creates potential for violations of the state\u2019s Open Meetings Act. Two members who happen to run into each other socially and wind up discussing policy issues would constitute a meeting that hadn\u2019t been property noticed to the public under the OMA. And some commissioners would like to explore consolidating the road commission with overall county operations.\n\nRoad Commission: Board Discussion \u2013 Appointment\n\nBarb Fuller was nominated by board chair Yousef Rabhi (D-District 8) to fill a seat vacated by Ken Schwartz when he took over as supervisor for Superior Township on Oct. 1. The position is for the remainder of a six-year term, through Dec. 31, 2018.\n\nFuller, who lives in Manchester, previously served as deputy supervisor in Pittsfield Township from 2008-2012. She provides organizational management and consulting services, and has served in a variety of leadership roles for groups including the Washtenaw Community College Foundation Women\u2019s Council and the Montessori School Board.\n\nIn her cover letter, Fuller cited her experience with funding and road-related issues while serving as Pittsfield Township\u2019s deputy supervisor. Among her references were current road commissioner Doug Fuller and state Rep. David Rutledge (D-District 54), a former road commissioner. She is not related to Doug Fuller. [.pdf of Barbara Fuller's application materials]\n\nOnly two people applied for the vacancy. The other applicant was Lisa Solomon, an Ann Arbor resident and business analyst with the University of Michigan Parking & Transportation Services, with a master\u2019s degree in urban and regional planning from UM.\n\nFuller would be the first woman to serve on the road commission since Pam Byrnes was appointed in 2000. Byrnes had been the first woman ever to serve on the road commission, but resigned before the end of her six-year term, when she was elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 2004.\n\nOther current road commissioners are Doug Fuller and Fred Veigel, who also is a member of the county\u2019s parks & recreation commission. The salary for road commissioners, which is set by the county board, is $10,500 annually.\n\nDuring deliberations, Dan Smith (R-District 2) asked whether Yousef Rabhi had received a letter of resignation from Schwartz. When it was determined that Rabhi hadn\u2019t received an official letter of resignation, Smith moved to postpone action on the appointment until Oct. 16. Smith said Schwartz can\u2019t hold incompatible offices, and he needs to choose which office he\u2019ll hold.\n\nRolland Sizemore Jr. reported that Schwartz hadn\u2019t attended the most recent road commission meeting.\n\nOutcome: The vote on the postponement was 6-3, over dissent from Yousef Rabhi (D-District 8), Rolland Sizemore Jr. (D-District 5) and Andy LaBarre (D-District 7).\n\nThe following night, at the Oct. 3 board working session, Rabhi showed The Chronicle a copy of the resignation letter he had subsequently received from Schwartz. Schwartz had previously sent the letter to Doug Fuller, chair of the road commission, and to the county clerk\u2019s office.\n\nRoad Commission: Board Discussion \u2013 Subcommittee\n\nIn a separate resolution, the county board was asked to create a new seven-member subcommittee to \u201cexplore partnerships and organizational interactions with the Washtenaw County Road Commission.\u201d Members nominated by Yousef Rabhi (D-District 8) for this subcommittee include four county commissioners \u2013 Alicia Ping (R-District 3), Conan Smith (D-District 9), Dan Smith (R-District 2) and Rolland Sizemore Jr. (D-District 5) \u2013 and three township supervisors: Mandy Grewal of Pittsfield Township, Ken Schwartz of Superior Township and Pat Kelly of Dexter Township. The resolution states that the subcommittee will be chaired by the county board\u2019s vice chair. That position is currently held by Ping.\n\nRabhi proposed an amendment, which was considered friendly, to formally add a road commissioner to the committee as a liaison. He said he\u2019d received that request from current road commissioners.\n\nThis resolution was considered late in the evening, at about 10:30 p.m. Conan Smith proposed an amendment that would give the subcommittee a $10,000 budget for possible research or travel costs to bring in experts on the issue. The proposal seemed to take several commissioners by surprise. He said that given the two statutory issues that would likely be considered \u2013 the size of the road commission board, and the road commission\u2019s operational status \u2013 it would be helpful to have resources available to do this work. He proposed coming to the county board later with an allocation plan about how that money would be spent.\n\nC. Smith noted that the issue of whether the road commission should become part of the county\u2019s operations \u2013 rather than a separate entity \u2013 has huge implications for the county. The subcommittee might need time from the county finance staff, or perhaps a consultant. He said the $10,000 budget doesn\u2019t mean it has to be spent, but knowing that it\u2019s available might mean the subcommittee thinks more seriously about the work that needs to be done.\n\nRabhi suggested amending C. Smith\u2019s amendment to add \u201cor in-kind,\u201d which could include staff time.\n\nRonnie Peterson (D-District 6) said the committee definitely needed to be limited in its scope. His understanding is that Washtenaw County is one of only a few communities in the state that\u2019s considering expanding its road commission. He didn\u2019t think the entire amount should be spent, but there should be flexibility to bring people in as needed. He trusted the commissioners on the subcommittee, and didn\u2019t think it would be wasteful. He thought that the Michigan Association of Counties could be helpful in this effort. Peterson suggested keeping the $10,000 and adding in-kind staff support beyond that amount.\n\nCurtis Hedger, the county\u2019s corporation counsel, pointed out that there were now three motions in play \u2013 C. Smith\u2019s original amendment, and two proposed amendments to that by Rabhi and Peterson. He suggested first considering Peterson\u2019s amendment to Smith\u2019s amendment.\n\nAndy LaBarre (D-District 7) objected. \u201cThe amendment to the amendment is ridiculous, as is the underlying amendment,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need $10,000 to discuss this.\u201d He pointed out that the board had previously debated setting up an advisory committee for the county\u2019s Platt Road site, and there was no budget attached to that. He said he understands the intent and that it\u2019s a complex issue, but \u201cjust throwing this on here at almost 10:30 at night doesn\u2019t look good and isn\u2019t needed.\u201d\n\nRabhi said he appreciated LaBarre\u2019s concerns, and that it was inconsistent to allocate funds to one committee and not another.\n\nFelicia Brabec (D-District 4) said the road commission subcommittee \u201cfeels a little bit different\u201d than the Platt Road committee or other citizen advisory groups. It will be looking at a major potential shift in how the county does business, she said, that has huge financial impacts. The people serving on that committee aren\u2019t experts, so it made sense to her to spend some money, if needed, on getting expert advice.\n\nRolland Sizemore Jr. (D-District 5), who serves as the county board\u2019s liaison to the road commission, said he\u2019s already starting to gather information on this issue. The subcommittee might need a little \u201cpocket money,\u201d but he can\u2019t see the need to spend more than $2,000 or so.\n\nAlicia Ping echoed Brabec\u2019s comments regarding the magnitude of the work. Not to minimize the Platt Road committee, she said, but the decision about the road commission \u201ccould change the face of the county.\u201d\n\nLaBarre replied that aside from other issues, C. Smith\u2019s proposal looked like it\u2019s adding pocket money \u201chalfway through the process.\u201d He wasn\u2019t comfortable with that.\n\nDan Smith (R-District 2) called the question, a parliamentary move to force a vote. A voice vote on calling the question passed unanimously.\n\nOutcome on Peterson\u2019s amendment to C. Smith\u2019s amendment, adding in-kind staff time to the proposed $10,000 budget: The amendment was approved on a voice vote, but was not unanimous.\n\nD. Smith then called the question on C. Smith\u2019s main amendment, as amended. The voice vote on calling the question passed unanimously.\n\nOutcome on C. Smith\u2019s amended amendment to add a $10,000 budget and in-kind staff support: The amendment passed on a voice vote, but was not unanimous.\n\nSizemore suggested an amendment putting a timeframe on the committee\u2019s work \u2013 of reporting back to the board no later than March 31, 2014.\n\nOutcome on Sizemore\u2019s amendment: It passed unanimously on a voice vote.\n\nRabhi said he would support the resolution, as amended. He hoped that the board would in the future apply more consistency to how it funds this type of committee. He said his earlier comments weren\u2019t intended to denigrate C. Smith\u2019s amendment.\n\nPing clarified with Rabhi that the $25 per meeting per diem would not apply to these committee meetings.\n\nOutcome on the overall resolution, as amended: It passed over dissent from Andy LaBarre (D-District 7) and Kent Martinez-Kratz (D-District 1).\n\nVeterans Relief Millage\n\nA resolution to levy an 0.0333 mill tax for indigent veterans services was on the Oct. 2 agenda for initial approval.\n\nThe current rate, approved by the board last year and levied in December 2012, is 0.0286 mills \u2013 or 1/35th of a mill. It generated $390,340 this year. The new proposed rate of 1/30th of a mill would be levied in December 2013 to fund services in 2014. It\u2019s expected to generate $463,160 in revenues.\n\nAccording to a staff memo, the additional revenue is needed to address rising claims, the anticipated release of current active duty soldiers, the increased cost of living reflected in claims, continued increases to demand, and an increased workload due to the Washtenaw County Veterans Treatment Court.\n\nThe county is authorized to collect up to 1/10th of a mill without seeking voter approval. That\u2019s because the state legislation that enables the county to levy this type of tax \u2013 the Veterans Relief Fund Act \u2013 predates the state\u2019s Headlee Amendment. The county first began levying this millage in 2008. Services are administered through the county\u2019s department of veterans affairs.\n\nThe county board had held a public hearing on this tax proposal at its Sept. 18 meeting, but no one spoke.\n\nIncreasing this tax was one of several revenue options that the county commissioners discussed at their Aug. 8, 2013 working session, as part of a broader strategy to address a nearly $4 million projected budget deficit in 2014. See Chronicle coverage: \u201cCounty Board Eyes Slate of Revenue Options.\u201d\n\nVeterans Relief Millage: Board Discussion\n\nDan Smith (R-District 2) asked for the administration to elaborate on the need for a 16.7% increase in the millage rate, which would result in about an 18% increase in overall revenues.\n\nMichael Smith, the department\u2019s director \u2013 and no relation to either commissioner Dan Smith or Conan Smith \u2013 noted that the increase would bring in about $73,000 more in revenues next year, compared to 2013. Last year, the department spent all of the millage revenues, he said, and dipped into its fund balance for an additional $47,000. Projections show the need for the department to again tap its fund balance this year for about $40,000, he said.\n\nM. Smith highlighted trends outlined in the staff memo, which point to an increased demand for services. The population of veterans in Washtenaw County has increased by about 1,000 or so, he said, with additional increases to come. With that increased veterans population likely will come an increased demand for services. He reviewed additional details of the services that will be needed, including reimbursement for burial services and relief for those in need. At this time last year, the department had spent about $78,000 for relief to indigent veterans and their families, including rent, utilities and food. This year, that amount has reached over $160,000.\n\nDan Smith thanked Michael Smith for the additional information, but said he remained concerned about the \u201clegal machinations\u201d that are involved to authorize the county to levy this millage. He indicated that he might have more to say on this issue during deliberations for the Act 88 millage \u2013 another pre-Headlee tax that the county levies to pay for economic development and agricultural-related initiatives.\n\nBy way of background, Public Act 214 was enacted in 1899. In part, it states that, \u201ceach county shall annually levy, a tax not exceeding 1/10th of a mill on each dollar, to be levied and collected as provided by law\u2026 for the purpose of creating a fund for the relief of honorably discharged indigent members of the army, navy, air force, marine corps, coast guard and women\u2019s auxiliaries of all wars or military expeditions \u2026 and the indigent spouses, minor children and parents of each such indigent or deceased member.\u201d During emergencies, a county may levy up to 2/10ths of a mill. Most counties in Michigan do not levy this tax.\n\nYousef Rabhi (D-District 8) asked how many times have veterans been turned away, because the department doesn\u2019t have sufficient funding? He wondered if $300 per burial \u2013 the amount of reimbursement that\u2019s mandated by the state \u2013 was enough to cover costs. \u201cMy heart tells me that we need to take care of the veterans who served our country,\u201d Rabhi said. He indicated that he\u2019d be willing to increase the millage even more, if additional funding is needed.\n\nM. Smith replied that no one is turned away, and that\u2019s why the fund balance is used. But looking ahead, he expects more revenues will be needed.\n\nRonnie Peterson (D-District 6) expressed concern about the number of hours that the department of veterans affairs was open \u2013 it operates on a four-day work week, with extended hours on those days. He wondered if staffing was adequate to provide the services.\n\nM. Smith reminded commissioners that when former commissioner Jeff Irwin was chair of the county board, Irwin had advocated for a \u201cgreen workplace\u201d initiative. It resulted in many county departments, including the department of veterans affairs, instituting a flex work schedule in 2008. For four days, Monday through Thursday, the department is open from 7:30 a.m. until 6:30 p.m., M. Smith said. This approach had been approved by the county administration, he noted.\n\nAs far as staffing, the department lost some staff at the end of 2011 due to retirements, M. Smith said, but most of those positions have been filled, except for a front desk worker. He expects to hire someone for that job soon. [The recommended 2014 budget calls for a reduction in that department of a 0.47 full-time equivalent position \u2013 a veterans affairs coordinator.]\n\nPeterson noted that prior to using this particular millage, the department had been funded through the county\u2019s general fund. He said he supported using the millage to augment that funding, but now support for the department has been shifted entirely to the millage. He said he\u2019s bothered by that. Peterson indicated interest in looking at whether more funding should be provided to keep the office open five days, while keeping the extended hours.\n\nPeterson requested a report from the county administrator that shows funding for the department over the past 10 years, as well as an indication about levels of service provided during that period. He also wanted to know what it would take in terms of funding to bring the department up to a five-day work schedule, with extended hours. Four days a week is unacceptable, he said.\n\nAlicia Ping (R-District 3) commended the department, noting that the relationships that the staff creates with veterans and the services they provide are extremely valuable.\n\nOutcome: Initial approval of the veterans relief millage increase was approved unanimously. A final vote is expected on Oct. 16.\n\nWISD Contract\n\nAuthorization to contract with the Washtenaw Intermediate School District (WISD) for educational services was on the Oct. 2 agenda for initial approval. [.pdf of WISD contract]\n\nFor 2013-2014, WISD will provide services to the Washtenaw County children\u2019s services department, as well as the juvenile detention and daybreak residential programs. WISD has been providing summer school sessions for the county since 2004.\n\nThe estimated cost for the 2013-2014 year is $531,347. State funding will pick up most of those costs, with the county responsible for an estimated $146,116. Half of that $146,116 will be eligible for reimbursement from the state Child Care Fund, leaving a net cost to the county of $73,058. The program will include four full-time-equivalent teaching positions and one FTE school social worker.\n\nIn addition to the current school year, the county board was asked to authorize renewal of the contract for a second year in 2014-2015.\n\nWISD Contract: Board Discussion\n\nAndy LaBarre (D-District 7) wanted to clarify an item related to financial arrangements of this contract. He referred to Section 6 in the contract:\n\nSection 6. In the event that the actual revenues of the Contractor in the Contractor\u2019s fiscal year for providing services under this contract from the Michigan Department of Education, and/or the United States Department of Education, do not equal or exceed the Contractor\u2019s actual expenditures for providing the services in the Contractor\u2019s fiscal year, Washtenaw County shall reimburse the Contractor for any such deficiency. The deficiency shall be paid by Washtenaw County within 30 days from the date that Washtenaw County receives written notice from the Contractor of the calculation and amount of the deficiency. The parties recognize that the lag in student count for funding through the Michigan Department of Education may result in a reimbursable deficiency for the Contractor\u2019s 2013-14 fiscal year.\n\nLaBarre asked if the county would be on the hook for additional unknown costs, in the event of a budget overrun. Lisa Greco, director of children\u2019s services for the county, responded that the contract amount is based on student \u201ccount day,\u201d using the same formula that the state\u2019s public schools use to calculate per-student funding. So the amounts in the WISD contract are based on projections of the expected number of students in the county\u2019s program, she said. The county would be responsible for any shortfall between the amount it receives based on count day, and the actual cost of staffing.\n\nOutcome: Initial approval of the WISD contract passed unanimously. A final vote is expected on Oct. 16.\n\nStand Your Ground Law\n\nThe Oct. 2 meeting began with public commentary, dominated by supporters of Michigan\u2019s \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d law.\n\nIn early September, board chair Yousef Rabhi had announced his intent to bring forward a resolution urging the state legislature to repeal the law, similar to a resolution passed by the Ann Arbor city council on Aug. 8, 2013.\n\nThe resolution had originally been on the county board\u2019s Sept. 18 agenda, but was pulled from the agenda before the meeting when it became uncertain that it would win sufficient support to pass, given the anticipated absence of some commissioners.\n\nEven so, several Stand Your Ground supporters attended the board\u2019s Sept. 18, 2013 meeting and spoke against the proposed resolution. And although the resolution was not on the Oct. 2 agenda, supporters of the law again turned out to address the board. Of those who attended the Oct. 2 meeting, 13 people spoke to the board on this issue during public commentary. Only one person spoke in support of repealing the law.\n\nMany of the Stand Your Ground supporters who addressed the board were from outside of Washtenaw County, including residents of Oakland, Macomb and Eaton counties, and several of them wore sidearms. Some were affiliated with Michigan Open Carry Inc., an advocacy group based in Lansing that has been urging people to attend the Washtenaw County board meetings to protest the proposed resolution.\n\nHere are some highlights of that commentary.\n\nPhillip Hofmeister, president of Michigan Open Carry Inc., told commissioners that Stand Your Ground laws have received a lot of attention since the George Zimmerman trial, but that trial \u201chad absolutely nothing to do with Stand Your Ground,\u201d he said. The only thing that the law says is that if you\u2019re in danger, you can use deadly force if necessary to protect yourself or someone else, Hofmeister said. It\u2019s not much of a departure from common law, he said.\n\nFour of the Stand Your Ground supporters were from Washtenaw County. Gordon Schott of Ann Arbor told commissioners that people have an inherent right to self defense, and the Stand Your Ground law enables them to do that. Many of his friends and people in the community that he\u2019s talked to feel the same way. He felt that there was no empirical data to support a repeal. Criminals are starting to realize that they\u2019re not the only ones walking around with guns, he said, and Michigan is safer as a result.\n\nSeveral other Stand Your Ground supporters who lived outside of Washtenaw County spoke, including one man who expressed disappointment that more people from Washtenaw County weren\u2019t there to advocate for the law. Thomas Partridge, an Ann Arbor resident who had spoken on a different issue earlier in the public commentary session, stood up and tried to address the board again while one of the Stand Your Ground supporters was speaking. Partridge didn\u2019t think that they should be allowed a turn unless they lived in Washtenaw County. Felicia Brabec, chair of the board\u2019s ways & means committee, indicated that Partridge should sit down.\n\nPublic commentary continued, with four more residents from outside of Washtenaw County speaking in support of Stand Your Ground. One man addressed the board by saying \u201cGood evening, city council.\u201d Each speaker received a round of applause after their remarks.\n\nThen, Kevin Sharp took the podium. He started by saying he hadn\u2019t planned to speak, but was glad he had come to the meeting. He noted that he\u2019s a long-time resident of Washtenaw County \u2013 a comment that resulted in a round of applause from Stand Your Ground supporters. But Sharp then said he felt that the Trayvon Martin case was \u201can absolute travesty \u2013 I think it\u2019s an embarrassment to this country.\u201d He thought the case had a great deal to do with Florida\u2019s Stand Your Ground law, and he supported any attempt to repeal the similar law in Michigan. The crowd did not applaud Sharp when he finished his statement.\n\nMary Percell, another Washtenaw County resident, gave an emotional commentary in support of Stand Your Ground. A year ago, there was an attempted break-in at her home. She did not have a gun at the time, she said, and she had felt very threatened. Since then, she and her husband educated themselves, because they wanted to be able to defend themselves. When they went to the class to learn how to use their guns, the instructors stressed safety first, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to kill anybody, but I want to be able to stand there and defend myself in my home.\u201d It had taken the police a half hour to arrive, she said, and it might have been possible for the intruder to break in and do harm to her family. She asked commissioners to consider this kind of situation before they vote.\n\nStand Your Ground Law: Board Response\n\nSeveral commissioners responded to the commentary. Andy LaBarre (D-District 7) thanked everyone who had spoken on this issue. \u201cI come down on a different side of the equation on this one than most of you do,\u201d he said, adding that he appreciated the time that people took to give their views, including those who had come a far way. He hoped the community kept this in mind when the board talks about social services or funding for other community priorities, and that people turned out for those issues too.\n\nLaBarre noted that he and other commissioners had received about 30 emails on the Stand Your Ground repeal. He pointed out that this resolution would be non-binding, and it wouldn\u2019t be applicable specifically to Washtenaw County. It\u2019s a common misperception that a repeal would somehow apply only to Washtenaw County, he said. The law is a statewide law that would require repeal by the state legislature, not the county.\n\nConan Smith (D-District 9) also said he supported the repeal of Stand Your Ground. Responding to a question raised during public commentary, he noted that it\u2019s not the board\u2019s policy to include the names of commissioners who put forward resolutions. However, he thought that commissioners who had a hand in developing this resolution \u2013 including himself \u2013 would be happy to own up to it. \u201cIt\u2019s not a secrecy thing,\u201d he said.\n\nSmith felt that one reason why Stand Your Ground deserves a hard look is that there\u2019s been a very difference in how the law is applied based on race. Prior to Stand Your Ground, Michigan residents still had a strong right to defend themselves in their homes, he said. Stand Your Ground extended the privilege of self defense in your home to apply to your self defense wherever you go. There might not be anything inherently wrong with that, he added, but what\u2019s happening is that the courts are applying that law in a way that correlates directly with race. You have to be careful about how a law is applied. Triple the number of African Americans are found guilty when using a Stand Your Ground defense compared to whites, Smith said. That\u2019s his major reason in asking for a repeal.\n\nAlicia Ping (R-District 3) also thanked the people who spoke about Stand Your Ground, saying that like the majority of speakers, she also is a supporter of the law. It\u2019s disappointing that the resolution was put forward, she said. The county board is a legislative body, not a lobbying arm, Ping said.\n\nYousef Rabhi (D-District 8) thanked the speakers but said he supported the repeal. He\u2019d gotten feedback on both sides of the issue, and called it a healthy dialogue.\n\nUpdate after initial publication: The resolution regarding a repeal of Stand Your Ground has been placed on the board\u2019s Oct. 16 agenda.\n\nMicro Loan Program\n\nAfter postponing action at their Sept. 18 meeting, commissioners were asked to take a final approval to a new countywide micro loan program for small businesses.\n\nInitial approval had been given on Sept. 4, and the item had been on the Sept. 18 agenda for final approval. However, at that Sept. 18 meeting only six of the nine commissioners were present, and supporters of the program didn\u2019t think there were sufficient votes to pass the measure at that time so a final vote was postponed.\n\nUnder the county board rules, a resolution requires votes from \u201ca majority of the members elected and serving\u201d in order to pass \u2013 that is, five votes. A resolution regarding the state\u2019s \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d law had been pulled from the Sept. 18 agenda for the same reason. That resolution did not appear on the Oct. 2 agenda, and it\u2019s unclear when it will be brought forward again.\n\nDan Smith (R-District 2) had cast the only dissenting vote against the micro loan program when the initial vote was taken on Sept. 4. He objects to using taxpayer dollars for a program where funds are allocated without the opportunity for input at public meetings, and believes there are other avenues that small businesses can use for financing.\n\nThe resolution would authorize the county\u2019s office of community & economic development to contract with the Center for Empowerment and Economic Development to manage this program. CEED already handles a smaller micro loan program focused on the eastern side of the county. [.pdf of CEED micro loan proposal]\n\nMicro loans would range from $500 to $50,000, for businesses that can\u2019t get conventional financing. CEED has a $5 million borrowing capacity from the U.S. Small Business Administration, and expects to make $300,000 in micro loans in the next two years in Washtenaw County. The county would provide $45,000 out of revenues from levying the Act 88 millage. Of that amount, $35,000 would be used to seed a loan loss reserve fund and $10,000 would be designated for initial operating costs.\n\nTo be eligible for a micro loan, businesses must be based in Washtenaw County and have been turned down by two financial institutions for loans over $20,000. Other requirements include: (1) a business plan for businesses that are less than 3 years old; (2) a marketing plan for businesses that are 3 years or older; (3) two years of financial statements and tax returns; and (4) a personal financial statement.\n\nThe county is allowed to levy up to 0.5 mills under Public Act 88 of 1913, but currently levies a small percentage of that \u2013 0.06 mills, which will bring in $696,000 this year. It\u2019s used for programs run by the county\u2019s office of community & economic development, and to fund the county\u2019s MSU extension office. Act 88 does not require voter approval. It was originally authorized by the county in 2009 at a rate of 0.04 mills, and was increased to 0.043 mills in 2010 and 0.05 in 2011.\n\nLast year, Conan Smith (D-District 9) of Ann Arbor proposed increasing the rate to 0.06 mills and after a heated debate, the board approved the increase on a 6-5 vote. [See Chronicle coverage: \"County Board Debates, OKs Act 88 Tax Hike.\"] Increasing this tax was one of several revenue options that the county commissioners discussed at their Aug. 8, 2013 working session, as part of a broader strategy to address a projected $3.9 million budget deficit in 2014. [See Chronicle coverage: \"County Board Eyes Slate of Revenue Options.\"]\n\nA proposal to increase the Act 88 tax to 0.07 mills will be presented on Oct. 16. A public hearing on that increase will also be held on Oct. 16. That increase is built in to the county administration\u2019s four-year budget proposal, which was presented on Oct. 2.\n\nThe county has identified economic development as one of its main budget priorities.\n\nOutcome: The micro loan program was given final approval on an 8-1 vote, over dissent from Dan Smith (R-District 2).\n\nNew Debt Policy\n\nCommissioners were asked to give final approval to a new way to pay off debt incurred from bonding, typically for public works projects in local municipalities. Initial approval had been given on Sept. 18.\n\nThe change will allow local units of government to repay bonds early \u2013 via the county\u2019s delinquent tax revolving fund (DTRF), which is administered by the county treasurer. The intent is to reduce interest rate payments while posing no financial risk to the county, according to a staff memo.\n\nThe maximum amount of the advance would be $1 million, with a term of 10 years or less. The action would require approval by both the treasurer and the board of commissioners. Several other criteria for using a DTRF advance are proposed:\n\nThe approval of an advance would be considered only for the county\u2019s own indebtedness, and would result in a reduction in the County\u2019s bonded indebtedness.\n\nThe local unit receiving the benefit agrees to contribute at least 10% of the outstanding principal amount of the debt toward the reduction of the bonded debt and to amend its contractual agreement with the county to include a new payment schedule and new interest rate(s).\n\nA refunding bond analysis must be performed to examine the potential for savings by selling refunding bonds.\n\nThe estimated cost of issuance for a refunding bond is 25% or greater than the estimated interest savings from the refunding bond sale.\n\nThe local unit has a bond rating in the top two tiers of a standard rating service, or if the local unit is too small to warrant a rating, a review of recent financial reports of the local unit shows that they are not experiencing fiscal stress.\n\nThe interest rate of the advance will be determined by the county treasurer and will exceed the rate of return received by the county treasurer in her/his pooled accounts.\n\nThe amended contract with the local unit will provide a process by which the county treasurer can adjust the interest rate.\n\nIn a related resolution, commissioners voted to restructure debt held by Bridgewater Township. The township owes $585,000 on $1.095 million in bonds issued in 2004 to fund a sewer system. County treasurer Catherine McClary has agreed to loan the township money to pay off the bonds. The township will repay the treasurer\u2019s office at a lower interest rate than it was paying for the bond debt, which was averaging 4.1%. The rate will provide a greater rate of return than the treasurer is currently getting on investments, according to a staff memo.\n\nThe amount of the advance from the treasurer\u2019s office is $430,000, loaned to Bridgewater Township over nine years at a starting interest rate of 2%. The township will use an additional $172,000 to pay down the existing principal on its bond debt. The transaction will cost about $6,000 in legal fees, which the township will pay. [.pdf of staff memo on Bridgewater Township debt]\n\nOutcome: Without discussion, commissioners unanimously gave final approval to both the debt policy and the debt restructuring for Bridgewater Township.\n\nPublic Hearings at Oct. 16 Meeting\n\nWashtenaw County commissioners were asked to set four public hearings for Oct. 16 to get input on items they\u2019ll be considering at upcoming meetings.\n\nThree of the hearings to take place on Oct. 16 relate to:\n\nAn increase to the Act 88 millage from 0.06 mills to 0.07 mills. The millage would be levied in December 2013 and would raise an estimated $972,635.\n\nThe proposed 2014-2017 budget, which was presented by county administrator Verna McDaniel on Oct. 2. The board is required to approve the $103 million general fund budget for 2014 by the end of this year. [.pdf of draft 2014-2017 budget]\n\nA proposed ordinance that would allow the county to issue municipal civil infractions for owning an unlicensed dog, and to establish that the county treasurer\u2019s office would be the bureau for administering these infractions. The public hearing on Oct. 16 would also cover proposed licensing fee changes.\n\nThe fourth hearing, also on Oct. 16, is for a proposed brownfield plan by the Chelsea Milling Co., makers of Jiffy Mix. The plan relates to a renovation of an abandoned warehouse at 140 Buchanan in Chelsea. The company plans to invest more than $4 million in the project. If the project is given brownfield status, it would allow the company to be reimbursed for up to $376,805 in eligible activities through tax increment financing (TIF). The total amount to be captured through TIF over 16 years is $580,677, which includes fees paid to the county brownfield program administration and the county\u2019s local site revolving remediation fund.\n\nDan Smith (R-District 2) said he continues to be concerned about the lack of an overall policy regarding the creation of TIF districts.\n\nOutcome on setting the public hearings for Oct. 16: All hearings were unanimously approved, with the exception of the public hearing for Chelsea Milling\u2019s brownfield plan, which was approved over dissent by Dan Smith (R-District 2).\n\nAgenda Briefings\n\nA resolution on the Oct. 2 agenda would eliminate the agenda briefings that take place almost two weeks prior to the board meetings. Currently, those briefings \u2013 which occur prior to the bi-monthly working sessions \u2013 happen so far in advance that very few agenda items are ready, and some commissioners have expressed frustration at the process.\n\nThe agenda briefings have had a history of controversy, mostly because of objections raised over the years by Ronnie Peterson (D-District 6). Several years ago, they were held the week prior to each board meeting. Those briefings were attended by most commissioners, and were open to the public. However, they were held in a small conference room at the county administration building, and unlike the regular board meetings and work sessions, the agenda briefings were not recorded for broadcast. Peterson found this objectionable, and did not attend those briefings.\n\nIn large part due to his urging, the board revised its approach and moved the briefings to the half hour prior to the board\u2019s working sessions, which are held on the first and third Thursdays of each month from September through May, and once a month in the summer. There are generally very few items on the agenda at that time, and minimal discussion among commissioners. Based on a review of Chronicle notes and minutes kept by the county clerk\u2019s staff, Peterson has attended five of the 15 briefings/working sessions held so far this year.\n\nThe original resolution brought forward on Oct. 2 contained four resolved clauses:\n\nNOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Washtenaw County Board of Commissioners hereby amends rule XI, E(4), to eliminate the Administrative Agenda Briefing from the Report of the Administrator;\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Board of Commissioners hereby directs the administrative staff to prepare and email a complete agenda packet, including supporting documents to all commissioners no later than noon two Tuesdays prior to a Board of Commissioners meeting\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that all questions and concerns should be communicated to the appropriate Chair no later than noon on the Wednesday prior to the Board of Commissioners meeting\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Working Session meetings will begin at 6:30 p.m., effective October 17, 2013.\n\nAgenda Briefings: Board Discussion\n\nRonnie Peterson asked how commissioners would be informed of upcoming agenda items, if briefings are eliminated. Yousef Rabhi replied that the administration will prepare a packet and email it to commissioners the week before the board meeting, and that as board chair, he and Felicia Brabec \u2013 chair of the board\u2019s ways & means committee \u2013 would be available if other commissioners have feedback. The official agenda packet will be printed and provided to commissioners on the Friday prior to the Wednesday board meeting.\n\nPeterson wanted to know where the public discussion would take place to develop the agenda for the board meeting? It appears that there won\u2019t be any public discussion, he said, and he felt the dialogue to develop the agenda should take place in a public setting. He said it\u2019s challenging for him to attend the 6 p.m. agenda briefings, but the briefings still should take place.\n\nPeterson said the commissioners had come out of back rooms and now discuss the agenda publicly, and he appreciated that. It didn\u2019t matter if only one commissioner showed up for the briefing, he said \u2013 it was still a public process. Commissioners elect the chair and vice chair to perform certain duties, he said, but it\u2019s up to the entire board \u2013 as well as the public \u2013 to help set the agenda.\n\nConan Smith said he bore some responsibility for this change, because he had challenged Rabhi about the process of creating an agenda two weeks before the board meetings. \u201cI felt the timing was off,\u201d he said. He said he hadn\u2019t considered the public dialogue piece, and he understood Peterson\u2019s concerns. C. Smith thought it was a \u201cdecent solution\u201d to start with email, then figure out how to engage the public.\n\nRabhi stressed his commitment to transparency, and suggested possibly posting a draft agenda online and distributing it to the media. The intention is not to hide anything, he said.\n\nDan Smith expressed concern about the email aspect of this proposal, and the potential for Open Meeting Act violations. He\u2019d hate to even start heading down that path, with the potential that people will hit \u201cReply All\u201d in order to give their feedback, thereby starting an email thread that could be considered deliberations. He proposed striking the second resolved clause, which mentions emailing the agenda packet:\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Board of Commissioners hereby directs the administrative staff to prepare and email a complete agenda packet, including supporting documents to all commissioners no later than noon two Tuesdays prior to a Board of Commissioners meeting\n\nC. Smith supported that amendment.\n\nThere was then some confusion about which resolved clause was intended for removal. In response to a query from Brabec, D. Smith said his intent was to eliminate the third resolved clause:\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that all questions and concerns should be communicated to the appropriate Chair no later than noon on the Wednesday prior to the Board of Commissioners meeting\n\nOutcome: On a voice vote, commissioners removed the third resolved clause.\n\nHowever, in announcing the outcome of the vote, Rabhi stated [erroneously] that they had just eliminated the third resolved clause from the bottom.\n\nAndy LaBarre said the briefings have evolved into a Q&A session that pushes back the start of the working sessions. Whatever they do, he suggested that it remains a true briefing and that commissioners can follow-up later with questions and concerns individually, so that the working sessions can stay on schedule.\n\nPeterson then expounded on the importance of the board having a public dialogue. It\u2019s the most economically challenging time he\u2019s experienced on the board, with the issue of unfunded retiree liabilities still unresolved. He said it was strange that commissioners wanted quicker meetings, while they faced a four-year budget with a projected deficit. \u201cYou don\u2019t need less meetings, you need more meetings,\u201d he said. It\u2019s not the administration\u2019s agenda \u2013 it\u2019s the board agenda, Peterson contended.\n\nPeterson agreed with D. Smith about the perils of email exchanges, noting that a local city council had been caught deliberating via email. Councilmembers had gotten their \u201cknuckles rapped,\u201d he said, and had deserved it. [The reference was to emails among Ann Arbor city councilmembers that were daylighted in 2009. The controversy played a role in the subsequent defeat of former Ward 3 councilmember Leigh Greden in the August 2009 Democratic primary.]\n\nPeterson said that if he received emails from other commissioners that showed they were deliberating, he\u2019d make it public. If the board isn\u2019t receiving the information it needs to set the agenda, \u201cyou\u2019re failing as the leader of the board, because that\u2019s your responsibility,\u201d he told Rabhi. Public business should be done in the public eye, he said, not by email or by sending notes to his house.\n\nRabhi replied, saying that when his leadership is called into question, he must respond. \u201cThere is no violation of the Open Meetings Act implied in this resolution,\u201d he said. Rabhi pointed to the third resolved clause, which stated that \u201call questions and concerns should be communicated to the appropriate Chair.\u201d When D. Smith pointed out that this resolved clause had just been eliminated by a vote of the board, Rabhi replied that he had included it when he wrote the resolution, because he wanted to ensure that the OMA would not be violated. \u201cFor that to even be implied is offensive,\u201d Rabhi said. He added that he\u2019s always been a chair who\u2019s valued openness and public input.\n\nIt makes no sense to do an agenda briefing two weeks before the regular meeting, Rabhi said. Nothing is accomplished, there are very few questions and it\u2019s not productive. Rabhi suggested he\u2019d support returning to the previous way that briefings were handled, but he noted that \u201ccertain commissioners\u201d had spoken out loudly against that. [Peterson had objected to the way those briefings were handled, because they weren't held in the boardroom and weren't televised.]\n\nRabhi noted that the board members who had attended a working session in early September had discussed revising the way that briefings were handled. That working session had been in the public eye, he noted. [Peterson had not attended it.] Based on that discussion, Rabhi said he\u2019d brought forward this resolution. \u201cI refute the accusations that this process would be in violation of the Open Meetings Act. It is a transparent process, and I am open to making it more transparent, should folks feel that it needs to be more transparent.\u201d\n\nConan Smith said he didn\u2019t feel that Rabhi had ever tried to keep anyone out of the process. The agenda briefing doesn\u2019t work now, he said, and he had confidence that whatever Rabhi proposed would include public engagement.\n\nD. Smith called the question on the resolution, as amended.\n\nThere was then some confusion about which resolved clause had been amended out. Some commissioners thought they\u2019d voted to eliminate the second resolved clause, while others thought they\u2019d voted to eliminate the third clause. D. Smith said he intended to eliminate the third resolved clause, to prevent people from starting an email thread when they send communications to the chair. He had no problem with the initial email communication from staff.\n\nLaBarre, noting the confusion, said that \u201cperhaps we ought to figure out what it is we\u2019ve done, before we go ahead and do it.\u201d\n\nCurtis Hedger, the county\u2019s corporation counsel, told commissioners that anyone who voted yes on the amendment could move for reconsideration. Alicia Ping then moved for reconsideration.\n\nOutcome on reconsideration: The motion to reconsider the amendment was approved over dissent from Dan Smith (R-District 2) and Ronnie Peterson (D-District 6).\n\nThe board then voted on an amendment to eliminate this resolved clause:\n\nBE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that all questions and concerns should be communicated to the appropriate Chair no later than noon on the Wednesday prior to the Board of Commissioners meeting\n\nOutcome: The amendment to eliminate this resolved clause passed on a 5-4 vote, over dissent from Yousef Rabhi (D-District 8), Rolland Sizemore Jr. (D-District 5), Felicia Brabec (D-District 4) and Andy LaBarre (D-District 7).\n\nThere was no additional discussion.\n\nOutcome on the resolution, as amended: The resolution passed on an 8-1 vote, over dissent from Ronnie Peterson (D-District 6).\n\nCo-op Month, Resolutions of Appreciation\n\nA resolution on the Oct. 2 agenda recognized October as Co-op Month in Washtenaw County. [.pdf of co-op month resolution] Five members of the Inter-Cooperative Council (ICC), an Ann Arbor student residential cooperative, were on hand, as was Kevin Sharp of the People\u2019s Food Co-op in Ann Arbor.\n\nIn addition to those two co-ops, the resolution also highlights other co-operatives in the county, including several credit unions, the Stone School Cooperative Nursery, Dexter Nursery Co-op, First United Methodist Cooperative Nursery, Ypsilanti Food Co-op, Student Buyer\u2019s Association, Farm Bureau, Midwest Organic Farmers\u2019 Co-op, Forest Hills Cooperative Housing, Arrowwood Hills Cooperative Housing, Pinelake Village Cooperative, and St. David\u2019s Co-op Apartments.\n\nIn presenting the resolution, board chair Yousef Rabhi (D-District 8) noted that he used to live in the ICC when he attended the University of Michigan.\n\nTwo other resolutions were in appreciation of businesses that had received the 2013 Business Enterprise Award from the Saline Area Chamber of Commerce: DesignHub Inc., a creative services and marketing firm, and Flatout Inc., maker of Flatout bread.\n\nOutcome: All resolutions passed unanimously.\n\nCommunications & Commentary\n\nDuring the evening there were multiple opportunities for communications from the administration and commissioners, as well as public commentary. In addition to issues reported earlier in this article, here are some other highlights.\n\nCommunications & Commentary: Michigan Association of Counties\n\nThree representatives from the Michigan Association of Counties (MAC) attended the Oct. 2 meeting: Executive director Tim McGuire, deputy director Steve Currie, and legislative coordinator Deena Bosworth.\n\nBy way of background, in late 2011 the county board voted to cut membership to the organization, as part of a broad effort to eliminate a budget deficit in 2012 and 2013. Dues would be $26,230 annually. Some commissioners have indicated interest in restoring membership to MAC for the upcoming budget cycle.\n\nOn Oct. 2, Bosworth addressed the board during public commentary, telling commissioners that MAC represented 81 of Michigan\u2019s 83 counties, but that in reality the organization represented all counties. That\u2019s because the issues that MAC worked on \u2013 including tax policy and environmental issues \u2013 affected the entire state. She gave a brief update on some of the association\u2019s advocacy efforts. She described MAC\u2019s approach as pro-active. As an example, Bosworth pointed to the fact that big box retailers are appealing their tax assessments, hoping to lower their tax bills and in some cases the state tax tribunal is lowering the assessments dramatically. MAC is advocating on this issue on behalf of all counties.\n\nOther issues include personal property tax legislation and state revenue sharing.\n\nCommunications & Commentary: Pension & Retiree Health Care Investments\n\nDan Smith reported that the board of the Washtenaw County Employees\u2019 Retirement System (WCERS), on which he serves, has started discussing the idea of private equity investing. He said the concept is \u201crather scary on its surface,\u201d but it might be worthwhile to invest a small portion of the portfolio in this way. It also might provide the county with an opportunity to put some of that money into businesses in Washtenaw County, he said. The discussions are still in the very early stages, he added, and he wanted commissioners to know about it.\n\nCommunications & Commentary: Exchange Student\n\nBoard chair Yousef Rabhi asked a student who was attending the meeting to introduce herself. She told the board that she\u2019s an exchange student from the country of Georgia, which she described as a small country near Russia, but one with a long history. She\u2019s a senior at Skyline High School in Ann Arbor. \u201cI love my school!\u201d she said, adding that she was attending the meeting for a government class. She said she didn\u2019t mind that the meeting was long, because some day she plans to be the head of her government, so these kinds of deliberations are interesting to her. She expected to attend more county board meetings during the year.\n\nCommunications & Commentary: Misc. Public Commentary\n\nTom Partridge spoke during the evening\u2019s two opportunities for public commentary. He told commissioners he was advocating for the county\u2019s most vulnerable residents, who need affordable housing, health insurance, and public transportation. He said he\u2019s a write-in candidate for Ann Arbor city council in Ward 5 on the Nov. 5 ballot, and is advocating for reforms in the city and the Ann Arbor Downtown Development Authority, as well as in the county and state. He called for all people to unite on these issues.\n\nPresent: Felicia Brabec, Andy LaBarre, Kent Martinez-Kratz, Ronnie Peterson, Alicia Ping, Yousef Rabhi, Rolland Sizemore Jr., Conan Smith, Dan Smith.\n\nNext regular board meeting: Wednesday, Oct. 16, 2013 at 6:30 p.m. at the county administration building, 220 N. Main St. in Ann Arbor. The ways & means committee meets first, followed immediately by the regular board meeting. [Check Chronicle event listings to confirm date.] (Though the agenda states that the regular board meeting begins at 6:45 p.m., it usually starts much later \u2013 times vary depending on what\u2019s on the agenda.) Public commentary is held at the beginning of each meeting, and no advance sign-up is required.\n\nThe Chronicle could not survive without regular voluntary subscriptions to support our coverage of public bodies like the Washtenaw County board of commissioners.
