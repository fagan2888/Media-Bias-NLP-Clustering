Parents are able to get check-ups for their kids, and consult the doctors when they have questions or concerns \u2013 all for free.\n\nShapiro has been working on the mobile clinics for more than 20 years.\n\n\"We bring [the mobile clinics] to a drop-in center where they\u2019re getting food, where they can rest, where they can get clothing. It makes it a lot easier for them to access care,\" he said.\n\nThe mobile health care units first hit the road in 1987 as an initiative started by the Children\u2019s Health Fund. There are now more than 50 mobile health units across the country \u2013 including in Michigan, West Virginia and Louisiana, each affiliated with a major local hospital system. Irwin Redlener, the founder of Children\u2019s Health Fund, said they\u2019re designed to fight the consequences of poverty.\n\n\"The health status of people that come to a clinic like this is affected by factors which are way more than infections and trauma,\"Redlener said. \"This has to do with the issues of poverty influencing health status \u2013 people who are in inadequate housing or who are homeless and people who are having transportation issues, and people who are experiencing severe domestic violence in their home.\"\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, more than 15 percent of the country \u2013 46.5 million people \u2013 were living in poverty in 2012. In that same year, 16.1 million children under the age of 18 were impoverished. Those rates skyrocket in the South Bronx \u2013 where Shapiro spends most of his time working -- where one in every two children live below the poverty line.\n\nFor the kids and their families who utilize the services of the \"big blue bus,\" the presence of the mobile clinic has had a significant impact \u2013 one that arguably goes beyond better health.\n\nJuan Robles, one of Shapiro\u2019s first patients, is now following in his footsteps.\n\nRobles began visiting Shapiro\u2019s mobile healthcare unit in his high school parking lot in the early 1990s, after he moved to the United States from Honduras with his four siblings. As he provided medical care to Robles and his family over the years, Shapiro eventually became a family friend \u2013 and mentor.\n\n\"He came to my wedding, he came to my graduation, so he has become, actually, part of our family,\" Robles said. \"And from that moment when we met -- many years ago -- I felt that compassion, that friendship that he brought into the patient-doctor relationship made a big difference.\"\n\nShapiro inspired Robles to pursue a career in medicine. Robles recently graduated from medical school, and as part of his residency at Montefiore, completed a rotation on the \"big blue bus.\" He now hopes to carry on Shapiro's work in the South Bronx.\n\n\"We have made significant progress, but there is a lot more that we can do,\" Robles said. \"These children who have tremendous potential to become physicians, lawyers, we just, we got to do something with them.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Over several days in January, NBC Nightly News followed the Montefiore Mobile Health Clinic as it made routine stops in the streets of New York City, providing healthcare where it simply doesn't exist: for the homeless.\n\"We know that homeless youth are n", "author": "The Daily Nightly", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "Over several days in January, NBC Nightly News followed the Montefiore Mobile Health Clinic as it made routine stops in the streets of New York City, providing healthcare where it simply doesn't exist: for the homeless.\n\"We know that homeless youth are n", "title": "Mobile clinics are healthcare lifeline for those in need", "url": "http://dailynightly.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/18/22352690-mobile-clinics-are-healthcare-lifeline-for-those-in-need", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/nn_08nsn_bus_140118.vmodv4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": 22352690, "section": "{\"domainName\":\"dailynightly\",\"displayName\":\"The Daily Nightly\",\"avatar\":\"http:\\/\\/nvcdn.nbcnews.com\\/_vine\\/images\\/av\\/30x30\\/group.gif\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/dailynightly.nbcnews.com\\/\",\"type\":\"group\",\"ass\":\"\",\"groupId\":\"4947\",\"articleCount\":\"5748\",\"seedCount\":\"4\",\"memberCount\":\"25\",\"description\":\"The NBC Nightly News blog.\",\"createDate\":1184002980,\"groupType\":null,\"groupTypeId\":\"5\",\"blessed\":0,\"lastPub\":1463788242,\"isEnabled\":1}", "title": "Mobile clinics are healthcare lifeline for those in need - The Daily Nightly", "trackData": "{\"section\":\"Nightly News\",\"subSection\":\"dailynIghtly\",\"sitePageId\":\"a22352690\",\"headline\":\"Mobile clinics are healthcare lifeline for those in need\",\"pageSource\":\"The Daily Nightly\",\"typeName\":\"Story\",\"byline\":\"The Daily Nightly\",\"tags\":[\"featured\",\"healthcare\",\"childrens-health-fund\",\"montefiore\"],\"seedSource\":\"\"}", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"asap\", \"load_pers\":\"1\"}", "cip": "165.254.127.100", "nv": {"contentId": 22352690, "contentType": "n"}, "date": "May 23, 2016, 4:32 pm", "server": "web08", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "canonical": "http://dailynightly.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/01/18/22352690-mobile-clinics-are-healthcare-lifeline-for-those-in-need"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e87\"", "article_summary": "The mobile health care units first hit the road in 1987 as an initiative started by the Children\u2019s Health Fund.\nOver several days in January, NBC Nightly News followed the Montefiore Mobile Health Clinic as it made routine stops in the streets of New York City, providing healthcare where it simply doesn't exist: for the homeless.\n\"So we bring the mobile clinic to them.\"\nThere are now more than 50 mobile health units across the country \u2013 including in Michigan, West Virginia and Louisiana, each affiliated with a major local hospital system.\nMobile doctors extend free health care and check-ups to impoverished families in South Bronx."}
