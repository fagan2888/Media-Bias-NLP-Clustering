He now harvests honey and sells his wares full time.\n\nIn August, Zambrano set up shop in his first brick-and-mortar location, at 1805 Florence Road in Killeen, where he makes most of his lotion, lip balm, candles and other beeswax products. He collects the honey near Copperas Cove.\n\nZambrano said it wasn\u2019t too long after opening his Killeen storefront that the Harker Heights Chamber of Commerce approached him about becoming a member.\n\nHe said he was told how it could assist him and learned about the benefits included with a $200 membership fee. Zambrano saw a few of those benefits Tuesday, as Heights chamber staff members and volunteers hosted a ribbon-cutting for his business.\n\n\u201cHeights is very proactive,\u201d he said. \u201cI get an email at least every two days. They\u2019ve got a mixer event. They\u2019re always promoting something or somebody. You can always reach them on the phone, and they\u2019ve got a website that you can post your stuff on for free. I feel like the Harker Heights chamber is very well organized.\u201d\n\nWhile Z\u2019s Bees is now a Heights chamber member, Zambrano said the Killeen chamber never approached him about joining, even though his business has been in Killeen for nearly eight months.\n\nHe said he\u2019s not sure why the Greater Killeen Chamber of Commerce hasn\u2019t approached him, and added the Copperas Cove chamber asked him join, though he declined.\n\nHeights chamber\n\nApproaching Z\u2019s Bees was not a new tactic for the Heights chamber. Dozens of Killeen businesses are members of the chamber, which has grown to about 850 members since its creation in 1988.\n\nPresident and CEO Gina Pence said about 150 of those are charter members. For a city of 28,000 people, she said there are a lot of members, even though many aren\u2019t in the city limits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d love for every business to move in to Harker Heights, but Central Texas is a big location that we definitely support,\u201d Pence said. \u201cEverybody has to work together. It\u2019s a great region, and that\u2019s really what we focus on, and that\u2019s why our member stats are a little higher than a normal chamber would be of this size.\u201d\n\nA \u201cnormal\u201d-sized chamber, however, isn\u2019t something easily defined, said Aaron Cox, the chief administrative officer at the Austin-based Texas Chamber of Commerce Executives, the longest-standing association of chamber of commerce professionals in the nation.\n\nOne city of 30,000 people may be a county seat and home to a lot of businesses. Another city of the same size may be a bedroom community and have few businesses.\n\nTo gauge whether a chamber has the membership it should, experts use penetration rate, Cox said.\n\n\u201cThe (United States Chamber of Commerce Accreditation guidelines) state that a chamber should have a penetration rate of about 17 percent or more in the business community that it serves,\u201d Cox said in an email. \u201cThis standard holds true across the industry.\u201d\n\nThe same is true of staff size, he said.\n\n\u201cIt could be that a chamber only has 300 members, but a $700,000 budget, which means they will have a lot more staff and likely a much more robust program of work,\u201d Cox said. \u201cIdeally, I would think a chamber needs one staff person per 200 members or so. Of course, this is not often the case.\u201d\n\nIncluding Pence, the Heights chamber has three full-time employees, a college intern and about 35 volunteers, or ambassadors, who help welcome new businesses. A 16-member board oversees the chamber.\n\nStaff salaries account for about 35 percent of the chamber\u2019s $380,000 operating budget, Pence said. The chamber\u2019s revenues come from membership fees and a city contribution, which uses a hotel and motel tax to help fund the chamber\u2019s effort to promote tourism. In this year\u2019s city of Harker Heights budget, $12,500 from the hotel and motel fund was allocated to the Heights chamber for events, including the Central Texas Food and Wine Festival. Another $41,000 in the general fund is for operational purposes, according to city documents.\n\nMembership fees for the Heights chamber start at $75 and go up depending on the type of business and number of employees. The average annual fee is $200, Pence said.\n\nThe fee includes various components \u2014 from business workshops, a social media class or information on how the Affordable Care Act would affect them, she said. During the past year, an online marketplace was added to the chamber\u2019s website to allow members to promote and highlight their products. The chamber also hosts morning coffee connections, an after-hours mixer and a more casual \u201csip and social\u201d event \u2014 all geared as ways for members to network with other businesses and potential clients.\n\n\u201cI think that we are really moving in the right direction, and I think probably the most difficult thing has been keeping up with the growth of our city,\u201d Pence said. \u201cAs a chamber, making sure that we\u2019re at that level, making sure that we\u2019re at our \u2018A game,\u2019 that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take to stay on top of it.\u201d\n\nKilleen chamber\n\nCreated in 1951, a board of 18 directors governs the Killeen chamber.\n\nIts annual operating budget is about $489,000, with $212,850 budgeted for salaries of 4\u00bd employees, said John Crutchfield, president and CEO.\n\nThe chamber receives additional funds from the cities of Killeen and Harker Heights to do marketing for the Killeen Economic Development Corporation, which this year amounted to about $677,000 from Killeen and $12,500 from Harker Heights.\n\nWith more than 200 volunteers, Crutchfield said they help with many initiatives \u2014 from participating in Hood Howdy to serving on the chamber\u2019s councils, which include military relations, nonprofit and information and technology.\n\nPrograms for members \u2014 or as the Killeen chamber calls them, \u201cinvestors\u201d \u2014 include training for local IT departments, bringing in state officials as guest speakers and developing relationships with Fort Hood.\n\n\u201cWe take folks out for a social at the end of their orientation day to kind of put faces on the community,\u201d Crutchfield said.\n\nHelping fund the chamber are investors and noninvestors who purchase products and services, such as event tickets.\n\nCurrently, there are about 725 investors, Crutchfield said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see ourselves as necessarily a membership organization,\u201d Crutchfield said. \u201cWe see ourselves as being more investor driven.\u201d\n\nWith memberships, Crutchfield said everyone tends to get the same benefits, but a business with 3,600 employees may not have the same needs as a locally owned and operated business.\n\nMembers can be complimentary members or lifetime members, and Crutchfield said the key is what sort of resources are procured.\n\n\u201cChambers used to believe that a big number of members made you more influential,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the case anymore.\u201d\n\nCrutchfield said there\u2019s not a \u201cone-size-fits-all membership,\u201d with some investors wanting basic affiliation and exposure.\n\nThe chamber has four tiers, starting at $300 annually and going up to $3,500.\n\nA $300 investor might get newsletter access, listings in newsletters and a ticket to a chamber event, while a higher level investor gets a different value, such as a table of eight at a chamber event or advertisement in a publication.\n\n\u201cWe literally sit down with an investor and say, \u2018How much you want to spend and what do you want to spend it on?\u2019\u201d Crutchfield said. \u201cSo every package is different, and when we go back with them at the end of the year, we sit down and say: \u2018Did you get your money\u2019s worth? If you didn\u2019t get your money\u2019s worth, what do we need to do to give you your money\u2019s worth?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Killeen chamber\u2019s recruiting process consists of one employee following leads, making cold calls or welcoming new businesses, he said.\n\nCopperas Cove chamber\n\nIn Copperas Cove, chamber membership dues range from annual fees of $100 for nonprofit organizations or private citizens to $1,000 for institutional businesses such as banks or utility companies, according to the chamber\u2019s website. Most members fall in between, with small businesses paying annual dues of $250 and regional businesses, such as hotels or restaurants, paying $500, said Betty Price, chamber president.\n\n\u201cWe currently have 432 active members of the chamber,\u201d she said. \u201cOur chamber goes back to at least the \u201940s, maybe even the \u201930s.\u201d\n\nThe chamber\u2019s annual operating budget is about $365,000, Price said, adding the chamber has four full-time employees, seven volunteers and two part-time employees who work a very limited schedule.\n\nIn addition to promoting business, the Cove chamber is tasked with promoting tourism in the city.\n\nHotel occupancy tax funds are granted to the tourism side of the Cove chamber by the Copperas Cove City Council to run events such as Rabbit Fest, Krist Kindl Markt and the cycling events hosted by the city.\n\n\u201cThey really parallel each other, because anything you do in the community will drive business. People will shop at our stores, eat at our restaurants and stay in our hotels,\u201d Price said. \u201cAnd it helps the people in the community, too, because the sales tax provides additional funds for the city.\u201d\n\nOne business, multiple chambers\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for a business to belong to multiple chambers of commerce.\n\n\u201cPeople say, \u2018Why would you belong to more than one chamber?\u2019 That\u2019s like asking, \u2018Why would you do business in more than one town?\u2019\u201d said J.R. Atkins, owner of Something Different Companies in Copperas Cove. \u201cYour business needs a base of people. For me, I do business all around Fort Hood. I live in Gatesville, have an office in Cove, work all along (U.S. Highway) 190 to Killeen, Harker Heights, Belton and Temple.\u201d\n\nBelonging to multiple chambers can translate to more exposure and opportunity, Atkins said.\n\n\u201cI belong to (chambers in) Gatesville, Belton, Harker Heights and now Copperas Cove, so I have my four-corners covered,\u201d Atkins said. \u201cBy partnering with a chamber, my marketing and their marketing go out together to bring in more people.\u201d\n\nFor bigger organizations, such as Metroplex Hospital in Killeen, being a member of Cove, Heights and Killeen chambers makes sense because the hospital serves residents from all three communities, said Metroplex spokeswoman Shelley Humphrey.\n\nCarlyle Walton, president and CEO of Metroplex Health System, added: \u201cWe are privileged to serve the communities of Killeen, Copperas Cove and Harker Heights, and the chambers represent a successful means to drive economic development, community vibrance and quality of life in these communities, which is collectively beneficial.\u201d\n\nHealthy growth for all\n\nAs the Killeen-Fort Hood metro area continues to grow, chamber officials point to medical businesses as a reason for growth in the local chambers. Pence said she attributes that to Seton Medical Center Harker Heights.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s anything to do with the medical industry, whether it\u2019s a hospital, a clinic or the components of the equipment standpoint of the pharmaceutical end,\u201d she said.\n\nMembership numbers fluctuate, as some businesses close or merge, but Pence said there\u2019s still an overall growth.\n\nCrutchfield said it\u2019s not a problem for Killeen businesses to be part of other chambers, and businesses in other communities also are part of Killeen\u2019s chamber.\n\n\u201cWe all see the world differently, but we don\u2019t compete,\u201d he said, adding Bell County and Williamson County chambers get together quarterly to learn about each other\u2019s communities.\n\nCrutchfield said chambers have a community identity and are focused on creating economic prosperity through participating businesses and community leaders, but each operates differently.\n\nWith technology and generational changes, organizations are challenged with determining ways to \u201cstay relevant in a world that is changing very rapidly,\u201d Crutchfield said.\n\n\u201cAnd if your organization is not changing faster than the outside world, you\u2019re losing,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Killeen Daily Herald", "description": "About four years ago, Z\u2019s Bees owner Michael Zambrano ordered his first beehive as a hobby with his grandfather and soon started selling honey on the corner of Trimmier and Stagecoach roads in Killeen.", "title": "Business benefits", "url": "http://kdhnews.com/business/business-benefits/article_28f28c52-d04a-11e4-af75-637172c32a96.html", "image": {"width": 938, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kdhnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/7e/d7ee5190-d032-11e4-b16e-476bf1392eee/550e1ae7be079.image.jpg?resize=938%2C630", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kdhnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "keywords": "greater killeen chamber of commerce,harker heights chamber of commerce,copperas cove chamber of commerce,copperas cove texas,killeen texas,harker heights texas,zs bees,chamber of commerce,united states chamber of commerce,business,top_story", "fb": {"app_id": 496799633680125}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/facebook.com/kdhnews"}, "msvalidate.01": "9F304B519542CC4AA866533D2B53AECA", "google-site-verification": "tvpDrly4oWZOJdt-kIl4RYZzursFYwXuQ-Ejs4m1V5k", "news_keywords": "greater killeen chamber of commerce,harker heights chamber of commerce,copperas cove chamber of commerce,copperas cove texas,killeen texas,harker heights texas,zs bees,chamber of commerce,united states chamber of commerce,business,top_story", "description": "About four years ago, Z\u2019s Bees owner Michael Zambrano ordered his first beehive as a hobby with his grandfather and soon started selling honey on the corner of Trimmier and Stagecoach roads in Killeen."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde734\"", "article_summary": "I feel like the Harker Heights chamber is very well organized.\u201dWhile Z\u2019s Bees is now a Heights chamber member, Zambrano said the Killeen chamber never approached him about joining, even though his business has been in Killeen for nearly eight months.\nHe said he\u2019s not sure why the Greater Killeen Chamber of Commerce hasn\u2019t approached him, and added the Copperas Cove chamber asked him join, though he declined.\nThe chamber receives additional funds from the cities of Killeen and Harker Heights to do marketing for the Killeen Economic Development Corporation, which this year amounted to about $677,000 from Killeen and $12,500 from Harker Heights.\nZambrano said it wasn\u2019t too long after opening his Killeen storefront that the Harker Heights Chamber of Commerce approached him about becoming a member.\nZambrano saw a few of those benefits Tuesday, as Heights chamber staff members and volunteers hosted a ribbon-cutting for his business."}
