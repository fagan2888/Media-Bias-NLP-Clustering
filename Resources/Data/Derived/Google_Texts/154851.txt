Sioux Falls, SD

It was at an apartment building on west Briggs Street where police say they found the 19-year-old victim who'd been shot. A short time later, the teen died.

Police say 21-year-old David Randle Jr was the shooter. He was allegedly handling a loaded gun, possibly an AK-47, when it went off, hitting the victim. Randle and the victim have been close friends for years, according to Randle's mom Shona. She tells KELOLAND News the shooting was an accident.

"I was shocked. I really didn't expect it. It's really quiet over here and there's not a lot that goes on. We were surprised," Koutsarath said.

Kayleigh Koutsarath says many young families live in the area. Dylon Krist is frustrated that someone would get shot near his home, considering all the children in the area.

"It's like, you know, kids are running around, playing every day. So somebody who's going to have an automatic weapon... I don't think that's right," Krist said.

Residents in the northwest side of Sioux Falls woke up to police cars this morning. However, residents say they're not too concerned about this isolate incident.

"It doesn't seem like it's a really random thing. I'm not afraid of someone coming up to my house or anything," Koutsarath said.

Police haven't released the name of the victim. Randle is being held at the Minnehaha County jail on suspicion of manslaughter.

UPDATE: According to the Minnehaha County Sheriff’s Office inmate listing, Randle faces two manslaughter charges: a first degree charge for heat of passion, and a second degree charge for recklessly killing. He also faces a charge of violating a stalking protection order and a felony charge for failing to appear.
