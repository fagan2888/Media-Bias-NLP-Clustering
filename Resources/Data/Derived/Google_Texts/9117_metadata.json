The company is incorporated in multiple jurisdictions, including Britain.\n\nTelegram, a tenth the size of Facebook-owned rival WhatsApp, has caught on in many corners of the globe including for a while with Islamic State as an ultra-secure way to quickly upload and share videos, texts and voice messages.\n\nAuthorities in China, Iran and Russia have threatened or taken action to block its service.\n\n\"We are not willing to compromise our values in order to increase our market share,\" Durov said.\n\nNonetheless, Telegram has grown like a weed in many emerging markets since launching 2-1/2 years ago. On Tuesday, it said it now has 100 million active monthly users. Members trade 15 billion messages a day.\n\nTelegram is widely used in the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia and Latin America, and has become Iran's most popular way for smartphone users to communicate while dodging the Islamic Republic's \"morality police\".\n\nIn a case highlighting the tensions between privacy and security in an age of pervasive electronics, the FBI is pressing Apple to unlock an iPhone linked to the December shootings in San Bernardino, California, in which 14 people were killed and 22 wounded.\n\nDurov inevitably sides with Apple and its CEO, Tim Cook.\n\n\"There\u2019s always a risk that your iPhone can be stolen, and the people who stole it can use the data, your private photos, etc to blackmail you,\" he said. Forcing Apple to build tools to defeat its own security methods would set a dangerous precedent, he added.\n\nCONSEQUENCES\n\nHighlighting the essential paradox of his absolutist stand, Telegram temporarily became a preferred app for Islamic State to distribute its violent propaganda, including taking credit for the Paris attacks in November that left 130 people dead.\n\nSince then, Telegram has had only partial success with efforts to dislodge online jihadists from its platform, similar to the struggle that bigger sites such as Twitter and Facebook have struggled to control.\n\nIt's an effort that half of the company's 30 less technical employees remain busy doing, taking down 10 to 12 jihadist sites per day, Durov said. This so-called \u201cabuse team\u201d is made up of remote workers from several countries, with no central office location.\n\nTelegram, whose services remain entirely free to users, has no plans to introduce advertising to support its growth but holds out the modern rebel entrepreneur's goal of building a viable business.\n\n\"Making profits will never be a goal for Telegram,\" its site says, and if it runs out of money, \"we'll invite our users to donate and add non-essential paid options to break even.\"\n\n\"This set of values does not necessarily prevent us from earning money,\" Durov told Reuters. \"I believe that at some point we should come up with a business model that would make us sustainable.\"\n\nThe company's operations are funded by Durov with some of the up to $300 million he reportedly took away from the forced sale when he was pushed out of VKontakte.\n\nDurov said he is bound by a legal agreement tied to the share sale not to disclose its value, saying only that he was \u201cextremely lucky\u201d to sell out before the Russian economy went into a tailspin in 2014.\n\nHe is looking to make a splash among world tech leaders on Tuesday night by hosting a party featuring up-and-coming British pop singer Tom Odell and Grammy award-winning producer/DJ Mark Ronson.\n\n(Additional reporting by Paul Sandle in Barcelona and Douglas Busvine in New Delhi; Editing by Hugh Lawson)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "BARCELONA (Reuters) - Pavel Durov, founder of secure messaging app Telegram and VKonta", "title": "Telegram app free-speech advocate no stranger to Apple-FBI woes", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/23/Telegram-app-free-speech-advocate-no-stranger-Apple-FBI-woes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/telecoms-mobileworld-security_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/23/Telegram-app-free-speech-advocate-no-stranger-Apple-FBI-woes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/telecoms-mobileworld-security_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "BARCELONA (Reuters) - Pavel Durov, founder of secure messaging app Telegram and VKonta", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\"We are not willing to compromise our values in order to increase our market share,\" Durov said.\nBARCELONA (Reuters) - Pavel Durov, founder of secure messaging app Telegram and VKontakte, lives in the vortex that now pits technology giant Apple against the FBI.\nNonetheless, Telegram has grown like a weed in many emerging markets since launching 2-1/2 years ago.\n\"This set of values does not necessarily prevent us from earning money,\" Durov told Reuters.\n(Additional reporting by Paul Sandle in Barcelona and Douglas Busvine in New Delhi; Editing by Hugh Lawson)"}
