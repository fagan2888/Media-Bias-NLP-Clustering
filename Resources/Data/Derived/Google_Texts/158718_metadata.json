Dayton and Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospitals opened the joint specialty care center to reduce duplication of services and make it more efficient. Bill Lackey/Staff\n\nBy Matt Sanctis\n\nStaff Writer\n\nTwo local children\u2019s hospitals began combined operations at a North Limestone Street facility Monday, a trend experts believe will continue as the Affordable Care Act influences health care delivery in Ohio.\n\nDayton Children\u2019s Hospital and Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital of Columbus opened Monday the joint outpatient specialty care center at 1644 N. Limestone St. The entities will remain separate, but will work together as the Ohio Pediatric Care Alliance to provide a variety of pediatric services to area patients.\n\nThe effort won\u2019t create additional jobs initially, but officials from both organizations said the long-term goal is to grow and add services that aren\u2019t available now. It will also allow both entities to eliminate duplication of services and become more efficient, said Vicki Giambrone, vice president of strategic partnerships at Dayton Children\u2019s Hospital.\n\n\u201cRather than duplicate efforts, we decided to find a way to partner together,\u201d Giambrone said.\n\nThe expansion of Medicaid and insurance exchanges under the ACA receive most of the attention, said Bryan Bucklew, president of the Greater Dayton Area Hospital Association. But one of the law\u2019s goals is also to provide incentives to pay for better quality health care, as opposed to paying for the number of procedures provided, he said.\n\n\u201cThese innovative partnerships are probably a precursor to what\u2019s coming with the Affordable Care Act as everybody looks at how you provide the most efficient, effective care and trying to make sure people have access to the system,\u201d Bucklew said.\n\nBoth entities had been operating in Springfield separately. Nationwide was already using the North Limestone Street facility, but Dayton Children\u2019s had been leasing space at the MercyCrest Medical Arts building on McCreight Avenue.\n\nOverall, the Dayton Children\u2019s Hospital provides care to as many as 290,000 children annually across the region. Nationwide didn\u2019t have patient totals immediately available.\n\nUnder the agreement, Dayton Children\u2019s will provide outpatient care in cardiology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, hematology and oncology, nephrology, and pulmonary and urology care. Nationwide Children\u2019s will provide Ear, Nose and Throat clinic services. The Nationwide Children\u2019s Child Lab, which provides laboratory services, will also continue to operate at the facility.\n\nServices such as X-rays and ultrasounds will also be added in Springfield as part of the agreement. The entities will continue to work with the community to determine what other services might be beneficial, Giambrone said.\n\nBoth organizations have a strategic plan to develop partnerships that can improve care for patients, said Valerie Ruddock, vice president of operations for Nationwide Children\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve pooled our resources and built on each other\u2019s strengths,\u201d she said.\n\nSimilar partnerships are likely to become more common statewide as health care providers navigate changes in the ACA, Bucklew said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty associated with (the Affordable Care Act) and you have all the different providers looking at ways they can be more efficient and effective,\u201d he said. \u201cSo you\u2019re going to see these kinds of partnerships continue to move forward throughout Ohio.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two local children\u2019s hospitals began combined operations at a North Limestone Street facility Monday, a trend experts believe will continue as the Affordable Care Act influences health care delivery in Ohio.", "og": {"url": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/childrens-hospitals-combine-resources-locally/nfKcp/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/03/24/6e/19/032514-Hospital-1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Two local children\u2019s hospitals began combined operations at a North Limestone Street facility Monday, a trend experts believe will continue as the Affordable Care Act influences health care delivery in Ohio.", "title": "Children\u2019s hospitals combine resources locally"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2014/03/24/6e/19/032514-Hospital-1.jpg", "title": "Children\u2019s hospitals combine resources locally", "site": "@daytondailynews", "card": "summary", "description": "Two local children&rsquo;s hospitals began combined operations at a North Limestone Street facility Monday, a trend experts believe will continue as the Affordable Care Act influences health care delivery in Ohio."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ddn", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/childrens-hospitals-combine-resources-locally/nfKcp/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2404409/news/news/childrens-hospitals-combine-resources-locally/nfKcp/", "keywords": "springfield,snsnewsletter,local,jobs,health,economy,community,business,SNShptop,SNShomepage,ACA", "google-site-verification": "fR8PW_DfizdYW0uymF5VkAzfbNKqKxqfnhqsbXSP7oI", "news_keywords": "springfield,snsnewsletter,local,jobs,health,economy,community,business,SNShptop,SNShomepage"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd762f\"", "article_summary": "Dayton Children\u2019s Hospital and Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital of Columbus opened Monday the joint outpatient specialty care center at 1644 N.
