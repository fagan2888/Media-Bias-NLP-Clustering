OSAWATOMIE, Kan. — Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback has been on the business end of numerous barbs and critiques for taking a stand against Obamacare and Medicaid expansion in the Sunflower State.

Those with unwavering faith in the federal government have characterized the conservative governor as an uncaring obstructionist for his opposition, but in an exclusive interview with the Daily Signal, Brownback laid out the argument against Obamacare in his own words.

“Obamacare’s not working, and it’s not going to work,” Brownback told the Daily Signal’s Genevieve Wood.

“Look at this honestly, the federal government has what, $12 trillion of actual debt, $70 trillion of unfunded obligations going into the future, and now they’re making this promise on top of a bill that is going to be gargantuan,” Brownback said. “When Obamacare is fully implemented, the cost of this to the federal government is going to be enormous. Now, do you think a fiscally solid, prudent state like the state of Kansas is going to end up with a 90/10 ratio on Medicaid, when the federal government is starting at that much cost? They’re going to up our percentage.”

According to recent data analysis, Kansas’ stance against Obamacare may have already started to save taxpayer dollars. A breakdown of raw enrollment and spending numbers on the Affordable Care Act last month revealed states that opposed Obamacare had a lower cost-per-enrollee than those who happily dove-in head first.
