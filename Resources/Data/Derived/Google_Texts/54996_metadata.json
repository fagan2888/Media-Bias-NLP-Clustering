The trustees warned, however, that the part of Social Security that pays monthly benefits to people with disabilities is especially fragile and, without changes, will start to run short of money for benefit checks in 2016.\n\nTaken together, the findings provide a nuanced portrait of the fiscal future of these two programs, which act as cornerstones of social insurance \u2014 and a buffer against poverty \u2014 for older people and other vulnerable Americans. The trustees welcomed the improved financial prospects for Medicare but acknowledged that the underlying reasons are not yet entirely understood. At the same time, they exhorted Congress to take steps to prevent both programs from collapsing in the long term.\n\n\u201cNeither Medicare nor Social Security can sustain projected long-run program costs,\u201d the trustees said in a message accompanying their reports.\n\nFor the past few decades, Democrats and Republicans have fretted about the unsustainability of the Medicare and Social Security programs. They have appointed high-level commissions, proposed legislation and tried to stoke public fears that benefits might not be available for their parents \u2014 or themselves. But Congress has not restructured either program to withstand long-term fiscal pressures, and the issue has been absent lately from the agendas of both parties.\n\nView Graphic Obama\u2019s budget proposal: Spending by agency\n\nAt a news briefing Monday, Cabinet secretaries and two public trustees reiterated the call for Congress to act. \u201c[We] must make manageable changes now, so we do not have to make drastic changes later,\u201d Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said.\n\n\u201cIt is getting very late in the game\u201d to find a bipartisan consensus, said the trustees\u2019 only Republican, Charles P. Blahous III, who worked on Social Security and other economic issues as an aide to President George W. Bush. \u201cA solution much further delayed is a solution much less likely to occur.\u201d\n\nBoth programs are being strained by the nation\u2019s demographics. As more baby boomers reach retirement age, people 65 and older are making up an increasing percentage of the country\u2019s population, with proportionally fewer working-age Americans chipping in payroll taxes.\n\nMedicare\u2019s finances are facing other pressures, too, including from scientific advances that lead to new treatment and therapies, the report said.\n\nThe trustees\u2019 forecast said that the trust fund that pays for hospital care \u2014 Medicare Part A \u2014 has been strengthened significantly, with the date when it is predicted to start running short of money extended by 14 years since the Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010. The report also predicted that the insurance premiums that older Americans pay for the portion of Medicare that covers doctors\u2019 visits and other outpatient care would probably remain the same for a third year in a row.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said that it is impossible so far to gauge how much of that trust fund\u2019s improved fiscal health was due to the health-care law as opposed to other changes in the health-care system that are slowing cost increases. She said both had a role. The ACA, for instance, is slowing payments to Medicare Advantage, the part of the program in which older Americans join private health plans, while other provisions focus on curbing hospital readmissions.\n\nThe report said that spending on hospital stays last year was less than expected, although trustees noted that analysts have not determined whether this trend reflected broad economic trends or stemmed from specific changes in the practice of medical care.\n\nIf Medicare is unchanged by 2030, the year it is projected to become insolvent, it would then be able to pay 85 percent of its beneficiaries\u2019 hospital bills, a proportion that would slip to 75 percent by 2047, the forecast said.\n\nFor Social Security, the trustees predicted that the program\u2019s two separate trust funds will, combined, have enough money to pay all the retirement and disability benefits it owes until 2033, the same time horizon as in the last two annual forecasts. They forecast that Social Security will be able to afford checks for retirees and workers\u2019 survivors until 2034 \u2014 nearly two decades longer than the part of the program that pays disability benefits.\n\nSocial Security\u2019s expenditures last year exceeded its income from payroll taxes, as it has each year since 2010, the report says, although interest so far is making up the difference.\n\nThis year, President Obama backed away from an idea he broached in his budget last year to save money for Social Security by changing the basis on which inflation is calculated for the program. But his 2015 budget proposal reprises the idea of charging more for care under Medicare to older Americans who are relatively well-off \u2014 an idea that Congress has not touched this year.\n\nIn calculating Medicare\u2019s future finances, the trustees for the first time acknowledged that Congress has each year overridden scheduled reductions in Medicare doctors\u2019 fees \u2014 cuts that, if adopted, would lower payments for doctors\u2019 services by 21 percent in 2015. In the latest report, the trustees assumed that such cuts would continue to be waived.\n\nThe trustees noted that their new forecast was released 49 years to the week that President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the law that enacted Medicare, a major component of the Great Society programs of the mid-1960s. Social Security was a response to the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nLast year, Medicare insured 52 million Americans, including 43.5 million age 65 and older and nearly 9 million younger people with disabilities. Social Security last year provided benefits to 41 million retired workers and their families, 6 million survivors of workers who died, and 11 million working-age people with disabilities.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "health, medicare, Social Security", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "But long-term challenges remain as graying population, higher medical costs cloud future.", "title": "Medicare finances improve partly due to ACA and hospital expenses.
