Former President (and potential first "first gentleman") Bill Clinton will speak at Georgetown University Tuesday, April 21, in the third of four lectures he plans to give at the Jesuit institution.



The university stated online: “The lectures examine the framework for a lifetime spent championing an idea espoused by his Georgetown professor Carroll Quigley: that America is the greatest nation in history because our people have always believed in two things — that tomorrow can be better than today and that every one of us has a personal, moral responsibility to make it so.”

The first of the Clinton lectures came in 2013, when the former president spoke on his background and the purpose of service. Clinton returned last year to argue the importance of public policy in a defense of Obamacare. There is no word yet on what Clinton is set to talk about tomorrow but it’s unlikely that he goes to bat for his wife’s presidential campaign – yet. He told Town & Country that his role “should primarily be as a backstage adviser” until the end of the campaign.

Clinton gave a series of talks at Georgetown University in 1991, as well, as he ramped up his own presidential campaign. In those three lectures, Clinton laid out a “New Covenant” on community, the economy and American security.

In a bit of happenstance, Clinton’s former foreign policy ally, ex-British Prime Minister Tony Blair will speak at Georgetown on Thursday, April 23, on “The Global Future of Development.” The university wrote online that his speech continues "a semester-long conversation" on the topic convened by the school's new Global Futures Initiative, which invites world leaders in the public sector, business, and civil society to engage with the university community around critical issues.
