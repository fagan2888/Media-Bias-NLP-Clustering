Healthcare innovation must include the approach that places the paying customer, the patient, in control of their personal healthcare choices and care through incentives,\u201d observed Dr. Mark Green referring to the proposed pilot program.\n\nThe pilot program will enroll volunteer participants whose income qualifies them for temporary assistance for needy families (TANF) in a newly-created TennCare flexible savings account initiative. Enrollees would receive an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card funded by premiums paid by TennCare to purchase primary care services and medications on an annual basis.\n\nElectronic payment is made immediately to treating physicians which reduces administrative costs and encourages provider participation. Patients in the demonstration program with funds remaining in the health savings account at the year\u2019s end keep those dollars as a reward for their healthier choices that have maintained wellness and their effective budgeting of spending.\n\n\u201cThe TennCare Opt Out pilot will align the goals of patients, providers and taxpayers who know the best way to reduce the cost of something is by putting the consumer in charge,\u201d concluded Senator Green, a practicing physician who serves as Vice Chairman of the Senate Commerce and Labor Committee.\n\nSJR 88 is projected to save Tennessee just over $6.8 million as calculated by the Fiscal Review Committee of the General Assembly. The resolution has passed the TN House Committee on Insurance and Banking and awaits review in the House subcommittee on Finance. Green\u2019s bill has passed TN Senate Committee on Labor and Commerce and is on the current calendar for Senate Finance, Ways and Means.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#ee33aa", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "application-name": "ClarksvilleNOW", "og": {"site_name": "ClarksvilleNow.com", "description": "TN Senator Mark Green, MD Calls upon Governor to move SJR 88 as TennCare alternative.", "title": "State Senator responds to health care study announced by House Speaker | ClarksvilleNow.com", "url": "http://clarksvillenow.com/local/state-senator-responds-to-health-care-study-announced-by-house-speaker/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://clarksvillenow.sagacom.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/43/files/2014/10/mark-green.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ClarksvilleNOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "img/touch/mstile-70x70.png", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "img/touch/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "img/touch/mstile-310x150.png", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-TileImage": "img/touch/mstile-144x144.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/clarksvillenow", "tag": "TennCare Opt Out"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "img/touch/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The resolution has passed the TN House Committee on Insurance and Banking and awaits review in the House subcommittee on Finance.\nGreen\u2019s bill has passed TN Senate Committee on Labor and Commerce and is on the current calendar for Senate Finance, Ways and Means.\nThe pilot program will enroll volunteer participants whose income qualifies them for temporary assistance for needy families (TANF) in a newly-created TennCare flexible savings account initiative.\nHealthcare innovation must include the approach that places the paying customer, the patient, in control of their personal healthcare choices and care through incentives,\u201d observed Dr. Mark Green referring to the proposed pilot program.\n\u201cExpanding an already failing system through Obamacare is not an option and only a typical response of government bureaucrats."}
