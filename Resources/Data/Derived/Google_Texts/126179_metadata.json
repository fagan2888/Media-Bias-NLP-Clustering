Then Gurka walked Phil Gosselin.\n\nPaul Goldschmidt then lined out to Jose Reyes. The shortstop threw to DJ LeMahieu at second to double off Inciarte, then he threw to Ben Paulsen at first to get Gosselin.\n\n\u201cIt was a perfect storm,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cTwo runners were in motion. That\u2019s how you draw it up.\u201d\n\nIt seemed like everybody involved was caught by surprise. The play unfolded like it was in slow motion and the crowd responded right as Paulsen caught the third out.\n\n\u201cThat was fun,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen very often. But it was a perfect situation. I\u2019m surprised a little bit that they were running with nobody out. They were winning the game. Maybe it doesn\u2019t matter for them at that point.\u201d\n\nWatch the play:\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the game,\u201d Goldschmidt said. \u201cIt may never happen again to me, personally. They got really good jumps. It was unfortunate. It maybe would have been nice to just take and let them get second and third with no or one out, but it was a good pitch to hit. It just happened to be right at him.\u201d\n\nIt was the fourth triple play in Rockies history. On May 18 against San Diego last season, Nolan Arenado and LeMahieu combined to turn three in a tricky triple.\n\nThe Rockies turned their first triple play on April 10, 2003, against the Cardinals at Coors Field. That play was turned by first baseman Todd Helton and shortstop Jose Hernandez.\n\nThe most famous Rockies triple play came on April 29, 2007. Troy Tulowitzki earned an unassisted gem against the Braves at Coors Field when he got all three outs at second base.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Ben Paulsen,DJ Lemahieu", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "On the Rox", "description": "In an otherwise sleepy ninth inning Tuesday at Coors Field, the Rockies turned a suddenly exciting triple play.", "title": "WATCH: Rockies turn a triple play at Coors Field, 4th in Colorado's history", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/09/01/watch-rockies-turn-a-triple-play-at-coors-field-the-fourth-in-colorados-history/20833/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2015/09/colorado-rockies-495x330.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "In an otherwise sleepy ninth inning Tuesday at Coors Field, the Rockies turned a suddenly exciting triple play.", "title": "WATCH: Rockies turn a triple play at Coors Field, 4th in Colorado\u2019s history", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/2015/09/01/watch-rockies-turn-a-triple-play-at-coors-field-the-fourth-in-colorados-history/20833/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/rockies/files/2015/09/colorado-rockies-495x330.jpg", "creator": "@nickgroke", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "In an otherwise sleepy ninth inning Tuesday at Coors Field, the Rockies turned a suddenly exciting triple play."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0615\"", "article_summary": "In an otherwise sleepy ninth inning Tuesday at Coors Field, the Rockies turned a suddenly exciting triple play.\nThe Rockies turned their first triple play on April 10, 2003, against the Cardinals at Coors Field.\nThe most famous Rockies triple play came on April 29, 2007.\nIt just happened to be right at him.\u201dIt was the fourth triple play in Rockies history.\nTroy Tulowitzki earned an unassisted gem against the Braves at Coors Field when he got all three outs at second base."}
