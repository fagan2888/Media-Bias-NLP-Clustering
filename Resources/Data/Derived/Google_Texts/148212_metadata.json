This is the regulation that was ruled illegal as applied to religiously owned businesses in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby in 2014.\n\nVarious companies wholly owned and operated by religious people\u2014such as Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., which is owned by the Green family, who are Evangelical Christians\u2014challenged the HHS Contraceptive Mandate for violating the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), a law under which actions of the federal government that substantially burden a person\u2019s religious beliefs are illegal unless the government proves that the burden is the least restrictive means to achieve some compelling public interest. (The HHS Contraceptive Mandate would also violate the First Amendment, but one rule of judicial restraint is that a court should issue a constitutional ruling only if no lesser authority can resolve the case.) The Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision struck down the HHS Contraceptive Mandate for violating RFRA.\n\nResponding to strong objections from religious organizations and being advised by top national authorities that the HHS regulation would not survive a court challenge brought by a church or religious ministry, the Obama administration made two carve-outs. The first is an exemption, but that can only be claimed by an actual house of worship (like a church) on other purely religious entity that is similar to a church.\n\nThe other is an \u201caccommodation\u201d for other faith-based groups, whereby they can fill out a certification form that will transfer their obligation to provide abortion-causing birth control to a third-party insurance provider. Many Christian colleges and similar entities brought suit, arguing that the accommodation still violates their conscience, knowing that signing the certification form meant that some other organization would now have a legal duty to participate in abortion-related matters.\n\nSeveral federal appeals courts have ruled either that the accommodation is not a substantial burden on anyone\u2019s faith, or that access to birth control is a compelling national interest. (It should be noted that these three-judge appellate panels have had liberal majorities.)\n\nIn this case, Sharpe Holdings, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of HHS, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit explained:\n\nEven if the ACA requires that insurance issuers and group health plans include contraceptive coverage regardless of whether CNS and HCC self-certify, it also compels CNS and HCC to act in a manner that they sincerely believe would make them complicit in a grave moral wrong as the price of avoiding a ruinous financial penalty\u2026.\n\nApplying RFRA\u2019s \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d test, Judge Roger Leland Wollman wrote that \u201cIf one sincerely believes that completing [the certification form] will result in conscience-violating consequences, what some might consider an otherwise neutral act is a burden too heavy to bear.\u201d The court also held that the ACA mandate is not the least restrictive means to accomplish HHS\u2019s objective of providing contraceptives.\n\nThe St. Louis-based court further reasoned, \u201cReligious beliefs need not be \u2018acceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to others\u2019 to deserve protection.\u201d As a consequence, the appeals court held that the HHS Accommodation violates RFRA.\n\nThe plaintiff\u2019s case was argued by Timothy Belz, a widely respected attorney in St. Louis who maintains a general practice but is also a committed Christian who regularly takes on religious-liberty cases.\n\nSharpe Holdings now creates what is called a \u201ccircuit split,\u201d which is the most common reason the Supreme Court decides to take up an issue to establish a national rule. There are currently several petitions for review (called a petition for a writ of certiorari) pending at the High Court, brought by the most accomplished Supreme Court litigator in America today, former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement, a partner at the law firm Bancroft. The most well known of those cases are the Little Sisters of the Poor v. Burwell, a case previously reported on by Breitbart News.\n\nThe justices are expected to vote in October whether to take one or more of these cases. Now that there is a circuit split on the issue, it is almost certain that the Supreme Court will take the case for argument, likely in January or February 2016.\n\nKen Klukowski is legal editor for Breitbart News.
