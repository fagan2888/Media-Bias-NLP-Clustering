The body of a man who robbed a Pueblo bank before diving into the Arkansas River to escape officers was found Monday floating in the water with the money he had stolen, police said in a news release.

Pueblo police and fire crews recovered the body of Jeffrey Cathcart, 40, from the Arkansas River near Runyon Lake, police said. The body was sighted in the river Sunday evening and finally located Monday.

“The recovery site was not far from the spillway where Cathcart dove into the water and was last seen,” the release said.

Cathcart disappeared on Thursday in the area where the body was found after he jumped in the river while fleeing from police. He was suspected of robbing a nearby bank and vanished into a spillway that leads to Runyon Lake.

Search crews scoured the river — which was running high after days of heavy rain — for Cathcart over the weekend, but did not locate his body.

Police said Cathcart taunted officers before disappearing in the water.

Cathcart was wanted on a felony warrant for a parole violation and was being sought in connection with a theft at a Pueblo grocery store in June, according to police.

“A large amount of cash, the exact amount stolen from the bank, was found upon Cathcart when he was retrieved from the river,” police said.
