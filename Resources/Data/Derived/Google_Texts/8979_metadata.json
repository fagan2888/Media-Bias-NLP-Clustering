The Foundation for Government Accountability is hoping to defeat the plan when it goes to the Utah legislature.\n\nThe Foundation for Government Accountability has been sending out direct mail pieces and advertising on Facebook. Its link goes to a website called UnhealthyUtah.com which urges Utah residents to oppose what it calls a \u201cMedicaid welfare expansion.\u201d\n\nJason Stevenson with the Utah Health Policy Project says FGA has been active in fighting several proposed alternatives to the expansion of Medicaid\n\nStevenson tells KUER, \u201cUtah isn\u2019t the first state they\u2019ve targeted. They\u2019ve been active in Arkansas and in Indiana, trying to stop efforts to bring people insurance in those states.\u201d\n\nFoundation Research Director Jonathan Ingram says it doesn\u2019t matter much what Governor Herbert calls it.\n\n\u201cThis is a Medicaid expansion,\" Ingram tells KUER. \"You\u2019re providing Medicaid enrollees with Medicaid benefits and limits on Medicaid cost sharing. There are some window dressings that the governor has proposed, but both the federal government and the state agree that this is Medicaid expansion under Obamacare.\u201d\n\nGovernor Herbert counters, \u201cThat\u2019s just patently false. I don\u2019t want to expand Obamacare. I\u2019ve never proposed an expansion of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAt the conclusion of his monthly news conference yesterday, Herbert said Healthy Utah is a way for Utahns to benefit from the hundreds of millions of dollars they\u2019re paying in federal taxes to subsidize health care.\n\n\u201cWe can either leave it there and they spend it however they see fit subsidizing other states,\" Herbert said. \"We get no benefit. We could do Medicaid expansion. That\u2019s 258-million dollars. Or, I\u2019ve said there\u2019s a third alternative, which is what we\u2019ve been negotiating.\u201d\n\nThe Foundation for Government Accountability is a tax-exempt political issue group that is not required to disclose its donors. As of midday on Friday, it wasn\u2019t identified as the sponsor of the Facebook ads or on the UnhealthyUtah.com website.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health Care", "description": "The group working to stop Governor Gary Herbert\u2019s Healthy Utah plan has been fighting similar battles in other states.
