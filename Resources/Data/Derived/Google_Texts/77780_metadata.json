Combined with the Supreme Court\u2019s unwillingness to tackle the abortion issue, women have vastly varying abortion access from state to state.\n\nNew legislation introduced in Congress this week signals a pushback from Democrats. Representatives Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), and Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) have introduced the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance Act, or the EACH Woman Act. According to RH Reality Check, the EACH Woman Act \u201cwould ensure that anyone who has health care or health insurance through the federal government also has coverage of abortion care.\u201d While the bill has 70 co-sponsors, it\u2019s unlikely to pass in a Republican-controlled House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe bill would prohibit states from restricting insurance coverage of abortion, which is currently allowed by the Affordable Care Act. Significantly, 25 states currently have laws in place that do not allow private insurers to cover abortion.\n\nThis legislation is a direct challenge to the Hyde amendment, which Congress passed in 1976, only three years after Roe v. Wade. Although the amendment has changed slightly over the years, the ACLU reports, the \u201cfederal Medicaid program mandates abortion funding [only] in cases of rape or incest, as well as when a pregnant woman's life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or injury.\u201d\n\nRep. Henry Hyde originally said of the bill, \u201cI would certainly like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an abortion: a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman.\u201d\n\nBut his legislation has disproportionately affected lower-income women and women of color. As the report by the Center for American Progress explains, \u201cwomen of color are more likely to rely on government health programs,\u201d while the Guttmacher Institute found that \u201capproximately one-fourth of women who would have Medicaid-funded abortions instead give birth when this funding is unavailable.\u201d\n\nIn 1980, the Supreme Court heard a challenge to the amendment in Harris v. McRae but ultimately upheld it. Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote in his dissent that it was \u201cdesigned to deprive poor and minority women of the constitutional right to choose abortion. That purpose is not constitutionally permitted under Roe v. Wade.\u201d\n\nRH Reality Check itemizes the would-be impact of the bill. It \u201cwould affect millions of women who receive health coverage through the federal government, including the one in six women who are enrolled in Medicaid; about one million female federal employees; women in the military or in the Peace Corps; young women under age 19 who are insured through the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); Native American women covered under Indian Health Services; and women covered under these programs through a spouse or a parent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Anna Diamond", "description": "For years, pro-choice advocates have been playing a game of whack-a-mole with anti-abortion legislation popping up in states with GOP-controlled legisl ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "For years, pro-choice advocates have been playing a game of whack-a-mole with anti-abortion legislation popping up in states with GOP-controlled legisl ...", "title": "Do Low-Income Women Have a Constitutional Right to Abortion?", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/07/10/each_woman_act_securing_abortion_access_for_poor_and_minority_women.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/xx_factor/2015/07/10/each_woman_act_securing_abortion_access_for_poor_and_minority_women/98780562-protestor-holds-up-an-anti-abortion-sign-outside-the.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For years, pro-choice advocates have been playing a game of whack-a-mole with anti-abortion legislation popping up in states with GOP-controlled legisl ...", "creator": "@anna_m_diamond", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/07/10/each_woman_act_securing_abortion_access_for_poor_and_minority_women.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/xx_factor/2015/07/10/each_woman_act_securing_abortion_access_for_poor_and_minority_women/98780562-protestor-holds-up-an-anti-abortion-sign-outside-the.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "title": "Do Low-Income Women Have a Constitutional Right to Abortion?&nbsp;", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-07-10T08:15:25Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Do Low-Income Women Have a Constitutional Right to Abortion?", "sailthru.headline": "The EACH Woman Act Is Reasonable, Necessary, and Doesn\u2019t Have Much of a Chance", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Do Low-Income Women Have a Constitutional Right to Abortion?\u00a0\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2015/07/10/each_woman_act_securing_abortion_access_for_poor_and_minority_women.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/xx_factor/2015/07/10/each_woman_act_securing_abortion_access_for_poor_and_minority_women/98780562-protestor-holds-up-an-anti-abortion-sign-outside-the.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"201150710001\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2015-07-10T08:15:25Z\",\n  \"section\": \"Double X\",\n  \"author\": \"Anna Diamond\",\n  \"tags\": [\"abortion rights\"]\n}", "fb-share": "Anti-abortion legislation disproportionately affects poor and minority women.", "tw-line": "Do low-income women have a constitutional right to abortion?", "keywords": "each woman act, hyde amendment, affordable care act abortion, reproductive rights", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.tags": "each woman act, hyde amendment, affordable care act abortion, reproductive rights", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.description": "For years, pro-choice advocates have been playing a game of whack-a-mole with anti-abortion legislation popping up in states with GOP-controlled legisl ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/xx_factor/2015/07/10/each_woman_act_securing_abortion_access_for_poor_and_minority_women/98780562-protestor-holds-up-an-anti-abortion-sign-outside-the.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Combined with the Supreme Court\u2019s unwillingness to tackle the abortion issue, women have vastly varying abortion access from state to state.\nRepresentatives Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), and Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) have introduced the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance Act, or the EACH Woman Act.\nJustice Thurgood Marshall wrote in his dissent that it was \u201cdesigned to deprive poor and minority women of the constitutional right to choose abortion.\nAdvertisementThe bill would prohibit states from restricting insurance coverage of abortion, which is currently allowed by the Affordable Care Act.\nSignificantly, 25 states currently have laws in place that do not allow private insurers to cover abortion."}
