One is in San Antonio and pays $55,000 a year, while the other is in Silicon Valley making $100,000 a year. My friends are advising me to move to California, but I feel like I\u2019d have more money in my budget if I moved to San Antonio. What do you think?\n\nThe good news about Silicon Valley is you\u2019d be around a ton of really smart people in your industry. I mean, it\u2019s the epicenter of the tech world, right? You\u2019ll learn a ton and have lots of opportunities, so there\u2019s definitely an upside.\n\nThe problem is that the Silicon Valley area is one of the most expensive places to live in the entire country. The real estate prices and cost of living are ridiculous! Still, if it weren\u2019t for the cost-of-living argument, it would be a no-brainer for me. Then, it wouldn\u2019t really be so much about the income and prices as it would be about the career opportunity.\n\nStill, you have to consider the economic factors involved here. With that in mind, it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say you might actually put more money in your pocket at $55,000 in San Antonio than you would $100,000 in Silicon Valley. That\u2019s entirely possible.\n\nI think things are going to come out pretty even \u2014 economically speaking \u2014 once you adjust for the cost of living. I\u2019m a huge fan of Texas. It\u2019s a great business market and tax situation down there. But really, in my mind the question comes down to your personal comfort level and quality of life. And that\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to answer for yourself.\n\nMy wife and I just became debt-free, and we\u2019re saving for our first house. We have about $75,000 in savings, and we\u2019d like to buy a home with cash in the next few years. Where do you think we should place our money so it\u2019s working for us while we save?\n\nI don\u2019t advise playing the market on the short term. If I were in your shoes, and looking at possibly a two- to four-year window, I\u2019d just pile the cash in a money market account or possibly a balanced fund.\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of growth stock mutual funds when it comes to long-term investing. The problem with that in this scenario would be the volatility of the market. By the time you\u2019ve saved up more money and spent time deciding on a house, the market may be down. All you\u2019re looking for in this scenario is a wise, safe place to park it and pile it up while you prepare.\n\nCongratulations. Debt-free is the way to be when you\u2019re looking to buy a nice, new home.\n\nDave Ramsey is a personal money management expert, author and national radio personality.
