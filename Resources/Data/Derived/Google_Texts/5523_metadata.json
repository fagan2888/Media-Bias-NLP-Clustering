Over at PolitiFact, that means it's time for the \"Lie Of The Year\" -- a dishonor they've been bestowing since 2009, without managing to particularly discourage people from lying. There are years where PolitiFact whiffs rather badly, but this year, they get a lay-up:\n\nIt was a catchy political pitch and a chance to calm nerves about his dramatic and complicated plan to bring historic change to America's health insurance system. \"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,\" President Barack Obama said -- many times -- of his landmark new law. But the promise was impossible to keep.\n\nImpossible to keep, and yet arguably critical to secure the passage of the law.\n\nThe best way to describe how the Affordable Care Act came to be the reason so many people actually lost their plans after Obama promised it wouldn't happen, is simply to note that the law grafted a lot of significant changes onto an already complicated health insurance marketplace. In the status-quo ante, the health insurance system already had a lot of cracks and fissures that could end up depriving customers of plans they liked -- between January 2008 and December 2010, for example, some 44,000 Americans were losing plans they'd like to have kept each week.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, however, went at that existing arrangement with hammer and tong, with the underlying goal of getting as many people who previously could not obtain insurance at all into the system. The law, basically, dramatically altered the marketplace, and as PolitiFact points out today, that caused the ground to shift under the feet of about 2 percent of the total population that was previously insured.\n\nThat's enough to stoke outrage. Possessing health insurance is critically important and people who obtain insurance plans take comfort in the continuity of these safeguards. Yes, some of these plans, when examined, turn out to be threadbare. But emotionally, Americans who obtain insurance fear being without it. And the cancellations wrought by the Affordable Care Act came at an inopportune time -- the economy was fragile, unemployment was still high, and most importantly, many of the people who lost insurance could not get the HealthCare.gov website to work.\n\nPerhaps the Obama administration simply underestimated the extent to which people losing their plans would trigger fear, anger, and anxiety, but there's no doubt that \"If you like your plan, you can keep it,\" shows a lack of sensitivity to basic human emotions.\n\nThe Obama administration compounded this by handling this whole matter very badly. Their too-clever-by-half explanation for what went wrong essentially boiled down to the grandfathering clause in the law, and blaming the insurance companies. As I explained a few months ago:\n\nOne of the provisions in the Affordable Care Act is a grandfathering clause, intended to exempt the employer-sponsored insurance plans that were in existence at the time of the Affordable Care Act's passage from having to follow the contours of the Affordable Care Act. The problem with the line, \"If you like your plan, you can keep it,\" is that it suggests that what's being grandfathered, here, is the customer's possession of a plan. But what was actually grandfathered were the plans that existed at the time, themselves. What that means is that everyone could retain their plans so long as no alteration was made to those plans by their providers. However, the very minute a provider made a tweak to those plans, they lost the grandfather protection, and compliance with the Affordable Care Act's new standards became necessary.\n\nThe thing is, Department of Health and Human Services estimates as early as 2010 predicted that substantial numbers of people would lose their policies in this fashion. So, \"If you like your plan, you can keep it,\" is the loud-shouted spin over the whispered warnings of HHS wonks. It's the slogan on a poster wheatpasted over the scary crack in the wall.\n\nSo why do I suggest that it was critical to secure the passage of the law? Well, I'm afraid you have to account for the cynicism of our politics.\n\nI am one of those types of people who vastly prefers to be leveled with, as opposed to being shined on. But even I can see how one might prefer \"If you like your plan, you can keep it,\" to \"When the law is implemented, it will vastly reshape the insurance market, which means a not-insignificant portion of the population will be dropped by their insurers or funneled onto plans that cost more, and not all of these people will end up finding their affordable opportunity on the new health insurance exchanges.\" The latter statement's honesty is the sort of thing that sends political advisers screaming from the room.\n\nPolitiFact puts this rather well: \"Boiling down the complicated health care law to a soundbite proved treacherous, even for its promoter-in-chief.\"\n\nThat's what makes \"If you like your plan, you can keep it,\" a particularly galling and nettlesome sort of lie -- it's the sort of falsehood that greases the wheels for a law's passage. You can look at it and see, quite plainly, that the Affordable Care Act wouldn't exist without the glib and misleading pronouncement.\n\nLike so many other things related to Obamacare, how people will ultimately judge Obama for this statement is entirely dependent on the law working in the way it is intended. In five years' time, if the law has delivered on the benefits it promised to the millions of Americans who lacked health insurance, it will remain one of those \"ends justifies the means\" cases that sits like a nauseous lump in our guts.\n\nOn the other hand, if in five years' time the law is a straight-up shambles, then Democrats are going to lose a lot of elections. But much more importantly, it will be decades before any lawmaker has the political courage to try to help the uninsured.\n\nThat's a pretty good argument for leveling with people, and maybe losing a legislative fight being a better strategy than glibly glossing over things and taking one's chances.\n\nREAD THE WHOLE THING:\n\nLie of the Year: 'If you like your health care plan, you can keep it' [PolitiFact]\n\n[Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?]\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Lies And Distortions Of The Health Care Debate Lies And Distortions Of The Health Care Debate\n\n1 of 12 Healthcare In America Is Already 'The Best In The World' One of the more positive sounding admonitions from health care reform opponents was that the United States had \"the best health care in the world,\" so why would you mess with it? Well, it's true that if you want the experience the pinnacle of medical care, you come to the United States. And if you want the pinnacle of haute cuisine, you go to Per Se. If you want the pinnacle of commercial air travel, you get a first class seat on British Airways. Now, naturally, you wouldn't let just anyone mess with someone's tasting menu or state-of-the-art air-beds. But like anything that's \"the best,\" the best health care in the world isn't for everybody. The costs are prohibitively high, the access is prohibitively exclusive, and the resources are prohibitively scarce. What do the people in America who \"fly coach\" in the health care system get? Well, at the time of the health care reform debate, they were participating in a system that was, by all objective measurements, overpriced and underperforming -- if you were lucky enough to be participating in it. As anyone who's fortunate enough to have employer based health care or unfortunate enough to have a pre-existing condition can tell you, health care for ordinary people already involved all of those things that we were told would be a feature of the Affordable Care Act -- long waits, limited choice, and rationing. When the Commonwealth Fund rated health care systems by nation , the top marks in the surveyed categories went to the United Kingdom, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Ezra Klein examined the study, and observed : \"The issue isn't just that we don't have universal health care. Our delivery system underperforms, too. 'Even when access and equity measures are not considered, the U.S. ranks behind most of the other countries on most measures. With the inclusion of primary care physician survey data in the analysis, it is apparent that the U.S. is lagging in adoption of national policies that promote primary care, quality improvement, and information technology.'\" Share this slide:\n\nGetty", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's end of the year honors time, here in the media, and with it comes another round of remembering the most dubious political achievements of 2013.
