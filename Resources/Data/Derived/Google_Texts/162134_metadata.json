A separate exchange could have referenced \u2013 depending on one\u2019s interpretation \u2013 highly classified material in an improper manner.\n\nRelated: Clinton Attempts to Cure the Email Blues. Again.\n\nThe inspector general for the 17 spy agencies that make up the U.S. intelligence community told Congress on Monday that two of 40 emails reviewed in a random check of the 30,000 emails Clinton gave the State Department included information deemed \"Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information,\" one of the government's highest levels of classification.\n\nUnder mounting criticism for her use of a private server for sending and receiving official email during her four years as secretary of state, Clinton consented this week to turn over to the FBI the private server she used while at the State Department. Republicans have lambasted the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination for what they insist was her negligence in handling the nation\u2019s secrets. Donald Trump, the GOP frontrunner, has repeatedly asserted that she may have engaged in criminal activity.\n\nThe two emails in question were marked classified after consultations with the CIA, which is where the material originated, government officials told the AP. They stressed, however, that Clinton did not transmit the sensitive information herself and that \u201cnothing in the emails she received makes clear reference to communications intercepts, confidential intelligence methods or any other form of sensitive sourcing.\u201d\n\nThe email exchange over drones begins with a copy of a news article that discusses a CIA drone program that targets terrorists in Pakistan and elsewhere. Although technically an official secret operation, the drone program is generally well known in the national defense community and is often discussed in the news media. The copy of the article makes reference to classified information, and a Clinton adviser followed up with oblique references that some might interpret as official confirmation of the drone program.\n\nRelated: Clinton\u2019s Email Problems Aren\u2019t Going Away Anytime Soon\n\nThe second email appears \u201cmore suspect,\u201d according to the AP report. While nothing in the message was \u201clifted\u201d from classified documents, some officials interviewed by the news organization said that it improperly points back to unspecified highly classified materials. Other officials, however, characterized what was done in far less sinister terms.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "We finally have some insight into the content of two \u201ctop secret\u201d emails found on Hill", "title": "Here\u2019s What\u2019s in Those \u2018Top Secret\u2019 Clinton Emails", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/14/Here-s-What-s-Those-Top-Secret-Clinton-Emails", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-libya-clinton_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/14/Here-s-What-s-Those-Top-Secret-Clinton-Emails", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-libya-clinton_1.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "We finally have some insight into the content of two \u201ctop secret\u201d emails found on Hill", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "We finally have some insight into the content of two \u201ctop secret\u201d emails found on Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server and flagged by a government auditor.\nOne message included a discussion of a news article detailing a secret U.S. drone operation in Pakistan, according to a report by the Associated Press.\nThe copy of the article makes reference to classified information, and a Clinton adviser followed up with oblique references that some might interpret as official confirmation of the drone program.\nThe two emails in question were marked classified after consultations with the CIA, which is where the material originated, government officials told the AP.\nAlthough technically an official secret operation, the drone program is generally well known in the national defense community and is often discussed in the news media."}
