Follow us @Globe_Health.\n\nAlmost a year after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed Medicare into law, Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson followed suit. Despite being similar in name, the Canadian bill covered all persons. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve come to know as universal health coverage, and it has been a principal difference between our two countries ever since.\n\nYou may also know of the narrative that has saddled American health care: yawning disparities in access, plenty of administrative \u201cwaste,\u201d as well as gross overpayments for routine health services. Add last-place finishes in the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s global rankings, and on the surface, the case for drawing lessons from America could seem fatuous.\n\nThis time, however, we find our neighbours four years into the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Some hail it as the \u201ccivil rights bill of a lifetime,\u201d others don\u2019t think it went nearly far enough, and when called by its nickname, Obamacare, it might as well be a Rorschach test for your feelings on the U.S. President himself. In fact, it\u2019s a bill that recognizes markets alone won\u2019t cure health care, while setting the stage for local policy experiments across the country. And as the ACA is widely being scored in its tally of the insured \u2013 over 20 million to date \u2013 extending health insurance is only one of its provisions. The rest of it aims to deliver care that is less expensive, more effective, and squarely patient-centred.\n\nThis is a challenge that should sound familiar. It\u2019s one most countries are grappling with, including ours. And as we string together lessons from higher-performing systems, such as in Europe, it might also be worth taking a humble look at this legislative leviathan.\n\nFocusing on payment reform: holding providers accountable\n\nA centrepiece of the ACA is the formation of accountable care organizations (ACOs). These are essentially networks of providers responsible for the whole spectrum of care through lump-sum payments. As an example, if a patient is managed in a cost-effective fashion, any savings are shared among providers. In contrast to LHINS (Local Health Integration Networks) in Ontario, the concept here is to do away with the bureaucratic layers and get right to what is really known to drive costs: the physician\u2019s pen. To make sure this doesn\u2019t lead to systematic rationing, providers can\u2019t keep the savings unless they reach measurable quality improvements. Surely, not all ACOs will be equal either; and only time will tell how successful they are in bringing costs down. But if they can eliminate unnecessary tests or procedures, there lies an upside both for patients and the public purse.\n\nWhile a fee-for-service model alarmed Bernard Shaw more than a century ago, much of Canada still runs on one. Experimenting with how to better align incentives with the needs of the patient should continue at home, while also finding the right mix of bundled payments to improve the co-ordination of care. There are certainly trade-offs with different payment schemes \u2013 and questions over which quality measures work best \u2013 but the United States is moving the way of rewarding value over volume. We should, too.\n\nMoving upstream: solving a health-care paradox\n\nThe ACA asks whether America has been spending all that money in the right places. Washington, a capital mired in gridlock, has long burdened the health-care system with deep social inequalities. Now, in a seemingly roundabout approach, the ACA is tasking hospitals to come up with solutions. In tying payments to outcomes that involve social factors, such as how often a patient returns to the hospital, it\u2019s nudging providers to move more care into the community. And to build healthier neighbourhoods, the ACA rolled out the Prevention and Public Health Fund \u2013 a near $15-billion (U.S.) response to the fact that most health-care costs are for preventable conditions. With such moves upstream and out of the hospital, we may be watching a serious departure from the medical fortresses that have long defined the American health system.\n\nOn the matter of a healthy society, Canada blazed a trail with the Lalonde Report more than 40 years ago. The premise was not to conflate health with health care alone. That meant reducing infections from hospital stays, but also protecting citizens from the pathologies of poverty. Fast-forward to today and we now stand last in early childhood education spending among our OECD peers, an area known to have some of the best returns for health and our economy. Perhaps then, the lesson here from America serves as more of a warning: Relatively skimping on social services can stack the deck against good health outcomes for future generations. That\u2019s a costly game no government wants to play.\n\nFocusing on transparency: Big data and value\n\nOne of the biggest knocks on America\u2019s health-care system is that it operates under a shroud of secrecy. For all the free-market talk, it\u2019s been hard to figure out what anything costs, which technologies work or who\u2019s paying whom. As part of the Obama administration\u2019s effort to improve transparency, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services released a landmark dataset on payments to physicians earlier this year. This data deluge took decades of litigation, and \u2013 while it\u2019s far from perfect \u2013 the hope is to detect some forms of fraud and shed light on practice patterns across the country. To better inform patients, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act will also require drug companies to publicly report virtually every transfer of value to doctors and hospitals. Moreover, for a country that has a deep disdain for limits (see death panels), the ACA ended up introducing the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute\n\nMuch of this could be done in Canada. Our single-payer system offers a big data platform that can help drive innovation. And in committing to greater transparency, patients will know how often surgeons are doing certain procedures, or how much their family doctor is receiving from pharma before filling a prescription. More research comparing different treatment options can also help assure patients that they are making the best possible care decisions. All this is important because it gets Canada closer to a crucial question: Where should we allocate our resources to get the best possible impact on people\u2019s health?\n\nThe audacity of hope in health reform\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s health reform can be a source of inspiration for Canadians. Especially when the obstacle is ultimately one of political leadership: Where a federal government is being faulted for doing too much, ours seems content in simply writing cheques. Where health-care providers are bunching together in the United States, we have failed to leverage the true efficiencies of a single-payer system. And so the saga continues.\n\nThis just can\u2019t afford to happen any more \u2013 not when we\u2019re sleeping next to an elephant fed up with being last.\n\nAndrew S.
