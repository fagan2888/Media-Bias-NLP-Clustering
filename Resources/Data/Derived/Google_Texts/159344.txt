A 54-year-old woman was struck and killed by a subway train in upper Manhattan on Monday, police said.

The woman, whose name is being held pending family notification, fell onto the tracks of a southbound 1 train while walking between cars as the train was in motion, police said.

Police responded to a call of a person under the train at the 207th Street subway station in the Inwood neighborhood of Manhattan around 10:30 a.m., and paramedics who responded pronounced the victim dead on the scene.

So far this year, seven people have been struck and killed by subway trains, an MTA spokesman said. In 2014, 58 people were struck and killed by subway trains.
