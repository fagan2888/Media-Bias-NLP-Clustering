These were western lands the colonists had their eyes on, upon which they had staked claims. The British had newly acquired Quebec following the French and Indian War, and King George III was setting up this separate government, just north of the colonists, and expanding its territory and freedoms. He made these decisions without consulting his constituents in the 13 colonies, or its representatives.\n\nPresident Obama for many years said he couldn\u2019t change immigration on his own. In 2011, he said: \u201cI know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the laws on my own. And believe me\u2026the idea of doing things on my own is very tempting. I promise you. Not just on immigration reform. But that\u2019s not how\u2014that\u2019s not how our system works. That\u2019s not how our democracy functions. That\u2019s not how our Constitution is written.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama cited as precedent things other presidents have done like this. None approaches the scale of this action. Last month, the president issued an executive order. He assured the nation the best way to solve our immigration problem is still through Congress, our elected representatives, but that Congress \u201chas failed,\u201d and \u201cthere are actions I have the legal authority to take as president.\u201d He cited as precedent things other presidents have done like this. None approaches the scale of this action.\n\nWhat about his earlier assertion that the Constitution doesn\u2019t allow him to bypass Congress? President Obama doesn\u2019t explain his reasoning. But, in fact, it is his duty to do so. The use of executive power is the ultimate use of force, and it is given to him alone in the Constitution. It is given only for constitutional purposes and only within the structure of separation of powers. It is the president\u2019s duty to make plain his understanding of the Constitution, to be transparent and predictable in every matter that touches on the Constitution. He already said this matter does.\n\nTwo great statesmen, Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill, when accused of changing their minds on serious constitutional matters, took pains to explain exactly the limits of their actions and the constitutional authority for them. They stood and faced the charge of inconsistency and defended their case to their nations. But President Obama neither upholds these duties nor takes trouble to explain his inconsistency. He simply uses his power to organize his constituency to his advantage without consulting his constituents. This is the kind of leadership from which the colonists declared independence.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 03 Dec 2014 06:53:14 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "President Obama\u2019s recent executive actions are clear despotism of the kind that caused America's founders to declare independence.", "title": "When The President Acts Like King George", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/shutterstock_172411295.jpg", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2014/12/03/when-the-president-acts-like-king-george/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "President Obama\u2019s recent executive actions are clear despotism of the kind that caused America's founders to declare independence.", "title": "When The President Acts Like King George", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/shutterstock_172411295.jpg"}, "creator": "@FDRLST", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": "Government", "tag": "Abraham Lincoln,Barack Obama,Constitution,Declaration of Independence,despotism,Executive Action,executive overreach,King George III,President Obama,tyranny,U.S. Constitution,Winston Churchill", "published_time": "2014-12-03T06:53:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "President Obama\u2019s recent executive actions are clear despotism of the kind that caused America's founders to declare independence."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd7f7\"", "article_summary": "President Obama for many years said he couldn\u2019t change immigration on his own.\nBut President Obama neither upholds these duties nor takes trouble to explain his inconsistency.\nPresident Obama doesn\u2019t explain his reasoning.\nThat\u2019s not how our Constitution is written.\u201dPresident Obama cited as precedent things other presidents have done like this.\nThe British had newly acquired Quebec following the French and Indian War, and King George III was setting up this separate government, just north of the colonists, and expanding its territory and freedoms."}
