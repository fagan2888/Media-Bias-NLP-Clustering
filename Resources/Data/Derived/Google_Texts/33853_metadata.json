They gathered in the Roundup Hall of the Texas Cowboy Reunion to field questions in an event hosted by the Jones County Republican Party ahead of the March 1 primary.\n\nAlthough the forum-style event provided ample time for each candidate to comment, none of the eight seized the opportunity to separate themselves from the pack on the issues presented to them by Jones County Republican Chairman John Harrison in front of about 60 people Tuesday morning.\n\nEach candidate said they would support repealing the Affordable Care Act and said health care should be returned to the private sector. When prompted for a stance on refugees and immigration, again all the candidates agreed they would vote to prohibit refugees from Syria while terrorism is still a threat. All eight of them also said they understood the focus on agriculture that\u2019s all but required for the seat. Although the candidates agreed on the issues, details of how they would accomplish their goals, if elected, were sparse.\n\nThe candidates running to replace U.S. Rep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Lubbock, who has held the seat since 2003, are former Texas Tech Vice Chancellor Jodey Arrington, farmer Jason Corley, Platinum Bank head Greg Garrett, veterinarian John Key, retired surgeon Donald May, farmer Don Parrish, Lubbock Mayor Glen Robertson, retired U.S. Air Force Col. Michael Bob Starr, and a director of nursing in Smyer, DeRenda Warren. They are all running as Republicans.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got options up here,\u201d said state Sen. Charles Perry, the Lubbock Republican who was a guest speaker. \u201cPeople that decided to put themselves out, put their families out to become the next congressional representative of this district. It takes a lot, more than I think people appreciate and understand.\u201d\n\nMay was the only candidate not in attendance, but Ysidro Gutierrez of his campaign was on the panel to speak on his behalf. Neugebauer announced this fall he will not seek re-election in 2016.\n\nAgriculture\n\nQuestion: How will you make a difference for agriculture, be it with the farm bill, regulation from the environmental protection agency or policy on foreign trade?\n\nKey said it\u2019s not as easy as simply passing a bill, but more so working with the staff at the United States Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Commerce to make sure the farmers\u2019 interests are being met and to prevent interference from the EPA and the Bureau of Land Management.\n\nMany of the other candidates also made mention of limiting the presence of the EPA and the Bureau of Land Management, but also making sure there\u2019s a fair share of subsidies available for cotton farmers.\n\n\u201cI totally support Congressman Mike Conaway out in the Odessa area at trying to get our cotton seed classified as a Title 1 oil seed,\u201d Warren said of the Midland Republican who serves as chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. \u201cThis will make it eligible for our farmers to have agricultural risk coverage and price-loss coverage.\u201d\n\n\u201cDr. May believes that the food stamps program should be separated; he will work on that as your representative, from the farm bill,\u201d said Gutierrez speaking on May\u2019s behalf. \u201cAnd Dr. May believes that agriculture is a national defense issue, he believes that food and fiber is one of the facets of national defense that will keep our nation strong.\u201d\n\nRefugees\n\nQuestion: What is your stance on allowing Syrian refugees into the country?\n\nRobertson suggested that with political, economic and trade pressure, the United States should force countries like Saudi Arabia to step up and take care of the refugees.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got the resources, they\u2019ve got the ability, they\u2019re in the region,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous for us to allow refugees that we cannot properly vet, to come to the United States.\u201d\n\nStarr agreed that refugees should not be allowed in the country until the threat of terrorism is over, but said in office he\u2019d be more focused on creating a safe place to live in Syria, so refugees won\u2019t be an issue.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why we\u2019re not spending more time talking about what we ought to be talking about, and that\u2019s creating a safe place for Syrian refugees inside of Syria,\u201d Starr said. \u201cWe can do that with American policy that focuses on it.\u201d\n\nImmigration\n\nQuestion: And what about the immigration issue?\n\nAll candidates stressed the need for more border security.\n\nArrington said border security is not an issue of \u2018we don\u2019t know what to do,\u2019 but rather an issue of \u2018not having the political courage.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe have the tools, we have the technology and we need to deploy all of it \u2014 including our military \u2014 to stop the inflow of people,\u201d Arrington said.\n\nCorley was the only candidate to recommend the construction of a wall.\n\n\u201cBuild a fence already. For the love of God, build a fence,\u201d he said, adding the potential to stop drug traffic would be beneficial for both the U.S. and Mexico and it would stop the exploitation of labor.\n\nAffordable Care Act\n\n\u201cIf it exists in the Yellow Pages, the government should not be involved in it,\u201d said Parrish, \u201cand last time I checked, there\u2019s plenty of doctors and hospitals. We\u2019ve got to figure out where government stops, and this is definitely it.\u201d\n\nThis opinion was echoed by all of the candidates.\n\nAs the owner of a bank, Garrett talked about the struggle he\u2019s having making sure he\u2019s able to provide health insurance for his employees.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that we don\u2019t have an additional tax, which is what this is,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll work to replace it, repeal it and call it unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nmatt.dotray@lubbockonline.com\n\n\u2022 766-8744\n\nFollow Matt on Twitter\n\n@mdotrayAJ", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Local News, MATT DOTRAY", "og": {"site_name": "Lubbock Online | Lubbock Avalanche-Journal", "description": "Agriculture, immigration, refugees among topics", "title": "First U.S. 19 congressional debate shows little separation", "url": "http://lubbockonline.com/filed-online/2015-12-22/first-us-19-congressional-debate-shows-little-separation", "image": "http://lubbockonline.com/sites/default/files/14991271.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "STAMFORD \u2014 This Jones County town of 3,040 isn\u2019t exactly the seat of power in U.S. House District 19.But on Tuesday, the community two hours east of Lubbock played host to the first open forum featuring eight of the nine candidates running for the open congressional seat in 2016.
