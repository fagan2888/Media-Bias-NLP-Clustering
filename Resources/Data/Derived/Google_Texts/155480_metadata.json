For instance:\n\nGovernment and private payers must adapt to evolving healthcare fraud activity, from simple upcoding to criminal enterprises. And fraud investigators now must look out for sophisticated schemes in which patients actually receive (sometimes needed) services--which could slip through fraud data nets, Trussell noted. Fraud investigators must also watch for emerging Affordable Care Act scams, such as copycat HealthCare.gov sites and medical identity theft. The increasing adoption of electronic health records has led healthcare into an era of \"perfectly documented fraud,\" according to Trussell. Many EHR systems, for example, allow autopopulation to automatically check what the clinician did to make the diagnosis and uncheck what he or she didn't do. And some software doesn't include audit trails.\"So you don't know whether the doctor checked or unchecked, whether it was the biller, the receptionist or some guy on the street,\" Trussell said. Medicare Part B billing has been growing slow and steady. Trussell pointed out several areas responsible for the uptick that need more attention from fraud investigators. Emerging schemes include medically unnecessary heart stents in cardiology, or dermatologists performing cosmetic procedures billed as precancerous lesions. What' really catching Trussell's attention is diagnostic testing in general and genetic tests in particular--which patients usually don't need and come with a $1,000-price tag. What's more, the testing companies are targeting outside the clinical area, socially engaging people at malls, for example. Sleep studies also deserve increased attention, as Medicare Part B billing for these services jumped 40 percent in the past five years, Trussell told the audience. On top of all these healthcare fraud hot spots, Medicare Part C, Medicaid managed care and Medicare managed care keep Trussell up at night. That's because managed care is a blind data spot and investigators can't see the big picture in the data.\n\n\"You've seen Medicaid managed care in one state, you've seen it in one state. And good luck getting the states' data to talk,\" Trussell said.\n\nBut with emerging--and evolving--healthcare fraud schemes, payers must use whatever data they have to enhance investigations and prevention efforts, Trussell advised--be they complicated algorithms or excel spreadsheets.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association's Annual Training Conference in Orlando, Fla, Jennifer Trussell, special advisor with\u00a0the Office of Investigations\u00a0at the Office of Inspector General outlined seven fraud trends that government and private health insurers must keep an eye on.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "At the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association's Annual Training Conference in Orlando, Fla, Jennifer Trussell, special advisor with\u00a0the Office of Investigations\u00a0at the Office of Inspector General outlined seven fraud trends that government and private health insurers must keep an eye on.", "title": "Healthcare fraud alert: 7 Trends to watch", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/healthcare-fraud-alert-7-trends-watch/2013-11-20", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Fraud Investigators,Fraud Schemes,Healthcare Fraud,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd590\"", "article_summary": "For instance:Government and private payers must adapt to evolving healthcare fraud activity, from simple upcoding to criminal enterprises.\nOn top of all these healthcare fraud hot spots, Medicare Part C, Medicaid managed care and Medicare managed care keep Trussell up at night.\nHealthcare fraud doesn't discriminate--it doesn't matter whether the payer is public or private.\nFraud investigators must also watch for emerging Affordable Care Act scams, such as copycat HealthCare.gov sites and medical identity theft.\nAnd fraud investigators now must look out for sophisticated schemes in which patients actually receive (sometimes needed) services--which could slip through fraud data nets, Trussell noted."}
