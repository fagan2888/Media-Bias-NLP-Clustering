Districts with higher property values receive less in state aid funding, as it\u2019s assumed those living in those areas are capable of paying through local tax levies.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nThe formula is aimed at keeping school districts equitable, so as not to allow lower-income districts to receive a substantially lower quality of education.\n\nBut when an industry like frac sand mining moves into town, it doesn\u2019t bode well for the district and its students. While the formula assumes the increased property values mean a huge economic boost to the community, in the case of silica mining operations, that\u2019s not always the case.\n\nAt this point, districts aren\u2019t sure what residents will see on their December tax forms, as there are a number of moving parts that are used to formulate state funding. All districts can do now is estimate \u2014 and hope for the best.\n\nThe Blair-Taylor School District knows this scenario well. After discovering the district\u2019s property-value base rose roughly $31 million, based on estimates, Superintendent Dennis Dervetski learned state aid for his school could be cut \u2014 to the tune of $500,000.\n\n\u201cI contacted the Department of Revenue and talked to them personally about, why the large spike,\u201d Dervetski told Wisconsin Public Radio. \u201cAnd it is the sand mines.\u201d\n\nFor Dervetski, that decrease in state funding isn\u2019t so much of a cut as it is an added cost, as local taxpayers will have to make up the difference \u2014 just how much is still up in the air.\n\nIn an interview with Mint Press News, Dervetski said it\u2019s too early to pin down a concrete figure. The head count for the district isn\u2019t taken until October, which is then used to determine the per-pupil funding formula for each district. In late October, the school district will determine the tax base.\n\nIn December, taxpayers will know if the new equation will mean they\u2019re going to have to reach into their own pocketbooks to make up for the cost of an inflated sand mine industry.\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll see what the phone does,\u201d Dervetski told Mint Press News. \u201cThen we\u2019ll know real quick.\u201d\n\nThe frac sand mining industry has boomed with demand from the fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, industry \u2014 the fine sand particles are necessary to the process, which shoots a cocktail of water, chemicals and silica sand into the earth to break up and access oil and natural gas.\n\nA boom-bust industry\n\nThe Blair-Taylor School district is located in the midst of Trempealeau County, an area hit hard by the frac sand boom.\n\nThe county board recently approved a temporary moratorium on any new frac sand mines moving into the area, but that was after 26 mines and processing centers were issued permits.\n\nPart of the district also reaches to Jackson County, where frac sand mining has erupted.\n\n\u201cAs we dig deeper into the region, we find Jackson County has an exceptionally high location quotient indicating the county is much more specialized in the sand mining industry than the rest of the region,\u201d a Wisconsin industry report states.\n\nJackson was one of the first areas to be hit hard by the industry, booming in 2011.\n\nIf the frac sand mining operations were contributing to a host of jobs in the area, districts could have property value increases balanced out by increased student count, but that\u2019s not the case. According to Workforce Connection\u2019s Frac sand mining industry report, the industry created 77 jobs in eight counties in 2011.\n\nThat\u2019s not enough to contribute any significant growth to student populations in the areas where mines operate, which could leave residents picking up the tab on an uneven tax base system.\n\nWhile an official head count won\u2019t be taken until October, Blair-Taylor School District is expected to see a decline in student population. According to The Eau Claire Leader-Telegram, enrollment in west-central Wisconsin has decreased drastically, with schools ranging in declines of 10 to 25 percent.\n\nThe tax base scenario is one that hadn\u2019t been explored by industry leaders \u2014 or taxpayers \u2014 until new district-wide property value assessments came in. Those who supported the industry had looked to the economic benefits that come along with enhanced industry, while those opposed had pointed to environmental and health issues as well as declining home property values as concerns.\n\nSchool districts were largely left out of the equation. According to Dervetski, the mines that popped up largely weren\u2019t discussed until they were there \u2014 a trend that\u2019s been seen throughout the state.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t say it\u2019s good or bad [for districts],\u201d Dervetski told Mint Press News. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s still hope that considering sand mining companies pay property taxes, it could work out in the taxpayers\u2019 favor. For now, it\u2019s too early to tell.\n\nFrac sand mining in Wisconsin\n\nThe potential for tax hikes on Wisconsin residents only adds to the qualms locals have with the frac sand mining industry. In the last 10 years, area residents have watched as the industry has boomed in their backyards.\n\nIn one decade, 120 sand mines have appeared \u2014 and while regulations for mining exist, many claim environmental impact reviews and temporary moratoriums should have been instituted, allowing room and time for the impacts of the industry to be assessed.\n\nResidents have seen their home values decrease, leaving them in a difficult situation. Selling a home near a frac sand mine isn\u2019t easy, while many wonder what the health impacts really are.\n\nConsidering that silica sand is the cause of silicosis, there\u2019s concern that those living near the mine are also exposed to high levels of silica sand dust.\n\nThe United States Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) considers workers\u2019 exposure to silica sand mining to be of concern, citing it as a \u201chealth hazard to workers conducting some hydraulic fracturing operations.\u201d\n\nIn Minnesota, where the industry is also rolling out, Wisconsin is being used as an example of what not to do, in terms of industry regulation \u2014 or lack thereof.\n\n\u201cWe know what the dangers are,\u201d Bobb King, director of Minnesota\u2019s Land Stewardship Project, told Mint Press News in February. \u201cWe went over to Wisconsin. They push a lot of money around. There are spills, air problems and property value problems.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Wisconsin, frac sand mining operations are wreaking havoc with property values and local tax evaluation formulas., frac sand, Fracking, property tax, school districts, silica sand mining, Wisconsin,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Trisha Marczak", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "In Wisconsin, frac sand mining operations are wreaking havoc with property values and local tax evaluation formulas., frac sand, Fracking, property tax, school districts, silica sand mining, Wisconsin,", "title": "A New Frac Sand Mining Woe: Tax Hikes", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/a-new-frac-sand-mining-woe-tax-hikes/168257/", "image": "http://mnpprodpublic.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/083013_fracking_16x9-690x388.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-03-12T14:17:58-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In Wisconsin, frac sand mining operations are wreaking havoc with property values and local tax evaluation formulas., frac sand, Fracking, property tax, school districts, silica sand mining, Wisconsin,", "creator": "@TrishaMarczakMP", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/083013_fracking_4x3.jpg", "title": "A New Frac Sand Mining Woe: Tax Hikes", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Front Page: National", "tag": "Wisconsin", "published_time": "2013-09-03T05:00:56-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-12T14:17:58-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde9cb\"", "article_summary": "A New Frac Sand Mining Woe: Tax HikesIn Wisconsin, frac sand mining operations are wreaking havoc with property values and local tax evaluation formulas.\nFrac sand mining in WisconsinThe potential for tax hikes on Wisconsin residents only adds to the qualms locals have with the frac sand mining industry.\nAccording to Workforce Connection\u2019s Frac sand mining industry report, the industry created 77 jobs in eight counties in 2011.\nBut when an industry like frac sand mining moves into town, it doesn\u2019t bode well for the district and its students.\nIn Wisconsin, residents living in school districts home to silica sand mining could have another argument on their side in the fight against the so-called \u201cfrac sand\u201d mining industry that\u2019s taken over the state in the last few years."}
