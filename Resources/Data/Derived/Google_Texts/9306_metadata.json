We\u2019ve put $5 billion into community health centers,\u201d he said, referring to a recent funding extension. \u201cThey do everything that Planned Parenthood does, except for abortion.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no reason for any money to go into Planned Parenthood,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, invested heavily in community health centers, creating the Community Health Center Fund to allocate $11 billion over five years to centers across the nation.\n\nIn the wake of a hidden-camera video showing a Planned Parenthood official negotiating over the price of fetal tissue, Republicans have renewed their calls for the federal government to stop providing funds to Planned Parenthood to operate its clinics, which provide abortions in addition to a variety of other services, around the country.\n\nPaul said that Republicans in Congress are going to bring a bill to defund Planned Parenthood to a vote by the legislature\u2019s August recess.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve persisted and I\u2019ve fought and I\u2019ve fought,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that what they\u2019re doing, manipulating the baby to harvest baby parts and organs, is despicable.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether he believes the bill will pass despite widespread Democratic opposition, Paul said, \u201cI think there are a few Democrats, who have said they\u2019re pro-life, who are going to be put on the spot.\u201d\n\nThe video, he noted, change the calculation. \u201cEven people in the pro-choice community are appalled.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "\u201cI\u2019ve persisted and I\u2019ve fought and I\u2019ve fought,\u201d he said.", "title": "Rand Paul invokes Obamacare as a reason to defund Planned Parenthood", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/rand-paul-obamacare-defund-planned-parenthood-120728.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/07/28/150728_rand_paul_ap_11602.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Obamacare,Senate,Health Care,Planned Parenthood,Rand Paul,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "\u201cI\u2019ve persisted and I\u2019ve fought and I\u2019ve fought,\u201d he said.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Rand Paul invokes Obamacare as a reason to defund Planned ParenthoodRand Paul has long supported defunding Planned Parenthood, but on Tuesday he invoked a new reason: Obamacare.\nPaul said that Republicans in Congress are going to bring a bill to defund Planned Parenthood to a vote by the legislature\u2019s August recess.\nStory Continued Below\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no reason for any money to go into Planned Parenthood,\u201d he added.\nWe\u2019ve put $5 billion into community health centers,\u201d he said, referring to a recent funding extension.\n\u201cThey do everything that Planned Parenthood does, except for abortion."}
