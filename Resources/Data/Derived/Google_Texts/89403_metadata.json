We must insist here, today, that there is nothing normal about innocent men and women being gunned down where they work.\u201d\n\nAs the nation faces the aftermath of the fifth mass shooting of Obama\u2019s administration, the president pleaded again for a common sense approach to guns. \u201cWe cannot stop every act of senseless violence, know every evil that lurks in troubled minds. But if we can prevent even one tragedy like this, save even one live, spare other families\u2026surely we\u2019ve got an obligation to try.\u201d\n\nObama challenged Americans to move beyond mourning and into action.\n\n\u201cDo we care enough to do everything we can to spare other families that is felt here today?\u201d he asked. \u201cOur tears are not enough. Our words and our prayers are not enough.\u201d\n\nAaron Alexis, a Navy veteran who had access to the Yard from his work as a subcontractor of Hewlett Packard with an IT firm called \u201cThe Experts,\u201d entered the Washington Navy Yard on Monday shooting and killing 12 people before dying in a shootout with law enforcement.\n\nThe president, Secretary of State Chuck Hagel, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, and Washington DC Mayor Vincent Gray all offered words of condolence to the families gathered together to mourn their loved ones. \u201cOur country is drowning in a sea of guns,\u201d Gray said, and that the violent deaths of men, women and children are a \u201cfact of life that we must stop accepting.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s shooting \u201cought to be a shock to all of us, it ought to obsess us,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt ought to lead to some sort of transformation. That\u2019s what happened in other countries when they experienced similar tragedies.\u201d The president cited Great Britain and Australia\u2014two countries that enacted strict gun control after mass shootings. Yet, efforts to expand background checks, or limit the size of gun magazines, after the massacres in Tucson, Ft. Hood, Oak Creek, Aurora, and Newtown, have all failed thanks in part to the lobbying of the National Rifle Association.\n\n\u201cIn the US, after the round the clock coverage on cable news, after the heartbreaking interviews with families, after all the speeches, and all the punditry, and the conmmentary, nothing happens,\u201d Obama said.\n\nBefore the names of the victims were read by Admiral Mark Tidd, Obama laid out some of what was lost in the violence, from the grandchildren left behind to the fact that Sylvia Fraser, one of the victims, loved people so much that she took a second job at Walmart. \u201cThese are not statistics,\u201d the president said.\n\nThe shooting has raised questions about security on military bases, and Hagel announced Wednesday that the Defense Department would review those procedures at bases around the world. There will also be a review into the security clearance process that granted Alexis the credentials to enter the base on the day of the shooting despite repeated incidents that suggested he was unstable.\n\nThere has been virtually no discussion of potential legislation; in addition to the Congress being tied up in the showdown over the budget and a possible government shutdown, the debt ceiling, and defunding the Affordable Care Act, the failure to pass a bill in the wake of the last major mass shooting is still fresh.\n\nObama said in remarks at a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation event Saturday night that work to reduce violence must continue. \u201cAs long as there are those who fight to make it as easy as possible for dangerous people to get their hands on a gun, then we\u2019ve got to work as hard as possible for the sake of our children. We\u2019ve got to be ones who are willing to do more work to make it harder,\u201d he said. No specific plans have yet been suggested.\n\nWayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the NRA, told David Gregory Sunday on Meet the Press that the shooting could have been prevented or the death toll limited if more individuals on the Navy base had been armed. La Pierre used similar language to what he used when talking about Sandy Hook. \u201cthe whole country,\u201d he said, \u201cknows the problem is there weren\u2019t enough good guys with guns. When the good guys with guns got there, it stopped.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "President Obama called on Americans to refuse to accept tragedies like Monday's mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard as a normal part of life at a memoria", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/do-americans-care-enough-demand-gun", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "President Obama called on Americans to refuse to accept tragedies like Monday's mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard as a normal part of life at a memoria", "title": "Do Americans 'care enough' to demand gun control?", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/do-americans-care-enough-demand-gun", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/2013/09/ap345786466392.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "Do Americans 'care enough' to demand gun control?", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/do-americans-care-enough-demand-gun", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/2013/09/ap345786466392.jpg?itok=9xT_4s8T", "height": 553}, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "President Obama called on Americans to refuse to accept tragedies like Monday's mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard as a normal part of life at a memoria"}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-09-22T18:21:10-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "President Obama called on Americans to refuse to accept tragedies like Monday's mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard as a normal part of life at a memoria", "nv": {"author": "meredith-clark", "tags": "democrats,guns,republicans,society", "contentId": "http://tv.msnbc.com/2013/09/22/obama-navy-yard-memorial-speech/", "title": "Do Americans 'care enough' to demand gun control?", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/do-americans-care-enough-demand-gun", "date": "09/22/2013 18:21:10 EDT", "published": 1}, "news_keywords": "Democrats, Guns, Society, Republicans"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0756\"", "article_summary": "President Obama called on Americans to refuse to accept tragedies like Monday\u2019s mass shooting at the Washington Navy Yard as a normal part of life at a memorial service for the 12 people killed.\n\u201cDo we care enough to do everything we can to spare other families that is felt here today?\u201d he asked.\nThat\u2019s what happened in other countries when they experienced similar tragedies.\u201d The president cited Great Britain and Australia\u2014two countries that enacted strict gun control after mass shootings.\nYet, efforts to expand background checks, or limit the size of gun magazines, after the massacres in Tucson, Ft.\nObama said in remarks at a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation event Saturday night that work to reduce violence must continue."}
