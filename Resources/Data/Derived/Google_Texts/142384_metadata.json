The event was cut short after protesters made it unable for the audience to hear. Jessica J. Trevino/Associated Press\n\nDetroit protesters shut down a public forum meant to celebrate the city\u2019s progress since it emerged from bankruptcy protection exactly one year ago, showing that many residents are still raw over the deep cuts made to their to health-care benefits and monthly pension checks.\n\nOrganizers behind \u201cDetroit Bankruptcy: One Year Later,\u201d held Wednesday evening at Wayne State University, ended the program in the middle of a segment with former bankruptcy judge Steven Rhodes, who presided over the city\u2019s historic case. Mayor Mike Duggan, who had been scheduled to speak, didn\u2019t get to take the stage.\n\nAs part of the bankruptcy process, Judge Rhodes ruled that city\u2019s money-saving plan, which cut $7 billion in debt, is fair. His decision brought to a close the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history.\n\nJudge Rhodes was booed throughout his interview during the forum; so was Gov. Rick Snyder. The Detroit News reported that protesters were angry over the pension cuts, water shutoffs and the control of city\u2019s leadership during the financial crisis.\n\nBefore being cut off by the forum\u2019s organizers, Judge Rhodes did get a minute to clarify controversial statements from an earlier interview in which he said that bondholders fared worse than the city workers with pension cuts. (He said his assessment didn\u2019t factor in the health-care cuts, just pension cuts.)\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ll give me just a second here, I\u2019m going to agree with those of you in the audience\u2026who are concerned that we contracted democracy in the city of Detroit,\u201d Judge Rhodes said above shouting from the audience.\n\nEarlier in the night, moderator and local journalist Stephen Henderson scolded the disruptive audience, saying \u201cthis is not Detroit behavior.\u201d\n\nDetroit News reporter Christine Ferretti, who covered the event, wrote about the final tense minutes of the forum on Twitter.\n\nCrowd continues to disrupt the program. Now chanting \u201cblack lives matter.\u201d One disruptive member of the crowd was asked to leave. \u2014 ChristineFerretti_DN (@cferretti_dn) December 10, 2015\n\nProgram leaders threaten those behind the outbursts that they will cancel the rest of the event if they can\u2019t respect the speakers. \u2014 ChristineFerretti_DN (@cferretti_dn) December 10, 2015\n\nProgram has ended without Duggan taking the stage. #DETNEXT. \u2014 ChristineFerretti_DN (@cferretti_dn) December 10, 2015\n\nWhen he cleared Detroit to leave bankruptcy, Judge Rhodes urged those who fought the changes to try to move past their anger and help city leaders execute a $1.4 billion revitalization.\n\nThe 680,000-resident city filed for bankruptcy on July 18, 2013, to try to negotiate cuts to $18 billion in debt, blaming tax revenue that fell after the real-estate crash and the city\u2019s population decline.\n\nThroughout the case, Detroit leaders fought pressure from some Wall Street creditors and others to sell the city\u2019s valuable art collection to repay a greater portion of the city\u2019s debt. Federal mediators helped negotiate a deal to use more than $800 million from private foundations and the state of Michigan to avoid that sale and make the cuts to city\u2019s worker pensions less severe.\n\nCity leaders eventually came up with a plan that called for the $1.4 billion reinvestment in removing blighted buildings and boosting police and fire services in the city.\n\nWhen he approved that plan, Judge Rhodes said he realized that some residents weren\u2019t happy about the bankruptcy. Some protested outside the federal courthouse, and he even gave them a daylong hearing to vent.\n\nWrite to Katy Stech at katy.stech@wsj.com.
