The company raised its earnings projection for all of 2014 to $6.45 to $6.60 per share, up from $6.35 to $6.55 per share.\n\n\n\n\u201cOur results speak to the strength of our diversified portfolio of business and our ability to succeed across many fronts,\u201d Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini said in a conference call Tuesday.\n\nAetna already offers plans on Obamacare exchanges in 16 states and Washington, D.C. and will expand into Georgia for 2015. They\u2019re currently one of the biggest players in Obamacare exchanges nationwide. UnitedHealth Group, one of Aetna\u2019s top competitors, took a slight hit in the second quarter but announced higher profits than it had projected.

While they continue to lobby against certain provisions \u2014 especially a hefty tax placed on each insurance policy a company sells \u2014 the individual mandate\u2019s requirement that all Americans purchase coverage rapidly expands their customer base.\n\nAnd insurers have been working closely with the Obama administration to make sure the law\u2019s implemented in a way that\u2019s friendly to them, if not to taxpayers.\n\nPressure from insurance companies may have played a role in the Obama administration\u2019s decision to back down from a promise to keep Obamacare\u2019s risk corridor program budget neutral, paving the way for a potential taxpayer bailout for insurers whose profits suffer due to the health-care law.

In December, Bertolini predicted premium hikes \u201cas high as 100 percent,\u201d warning that the company had shared its concerns with \u201call the people in Washington that need to see it.\u201d Bertolini more recently downgraded the projection to somewhere less than 20 percent.\n\n\n\nBertolini blamed the Obama administration\u2019s \u201con the fly\u201d changes to the health-care law\u2019s implementation, specifically the last-minute extension of cancelled health care plans, for close to half of Aetna\u2019s premium hikes for 2015, the Washington Post reported in April.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Expanding Obamacare exchange options", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Top health insurer Aetna reported boosted profits in the second quarter since Obamacare has been in effect as large insurance companies continue to win big from the health-care law.\u00a0    Aetna's earni", "title": "Surprise!
