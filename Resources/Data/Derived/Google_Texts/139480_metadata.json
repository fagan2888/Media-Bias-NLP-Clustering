Like many parents of freshmen, my husband and I drove him to school together, the back of the car filled with essentials like extra-long twin sheets, a clip-on light for his bunk bed and a random mix of extension cords.\n\nThe milk crates, shower caddy and three-ring binders we helped him carry up the stairs flashed me back to my own first days of college \u2014 but they weren\u2019t the only reason this experience felt so familiar.\n\nThree decades ago I was a freshman at the same university. Unlike Hayden, who grew up outside of New York and attended a competitive suburban high school, I was the only student from my small town in Maine to go to Yale, one of the few to even venture out of state. And I had no idea what I was getting into.\n\nI was lucky, in a way, to be so na\u00efve; I didn\u2019t know what I didn\u2019t know. I floated through my first year obliviously unaware of the social currencies being exchanged around me, only dimly perceiving markers of wealth and status.\n\nWhen a fellow student bragged about his Alfa Romeo, I thought he meant a Camaro, the fanciest car I\u2019d ever seen. When a classmate casually mentioned that she was meeting her parents in Gstaad for the long weekend, I assumed it was a town in Connecticut. Imagine my surprise when I realized that actual Vanderbilts lived in Vanderbilt Hall.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just my relative lack of sophistication that made my experience so vastly different from my son\u2019s. Typewriters and carbon paper, telephones with curly cords, TVs with a few channels and no remotes, cassette tapes; compared with the tools Hayden has at his disposal, I went to college in the Stone Age.\n\nWithout even thinking about it, my son uses technology in almost everything he does, large and small. He installed Yale-specific apps on his phone that provide information about when the washers and dryers in the basement of his dorm are available, the daily menus of each dining hall, ratings of local restaurants, student contact information, the entire list of classes, and an interactive campus map that shows you where you are and where you\u2019re going.\n\nWithin minutes of learning his three suitemates\u2019 names this summer, he knew an incredible amount about them: They friended and followed each other on Face\u00adbook and Twitter and Instagram and immediately had access to each other\u2019s prom pictures, family vacation shots, performance videos, philosophical musings. They established an ongoing group text, exchanging information such as who was bringing an Xbox and who had a coffeemaker. Soon after arriving on campus, Hayden made a spreadsheet of potential classes, vetting them in advance by using teacher rating sites and watching videos of potential professors on YouTube.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that my son is better prepared for college than I was. He manages his time better, is more efficient and more directed, and spends less time in lines and more time doing exactly what he sets out to do.\n\nBut I wonder what may be lost. I suspect it\u2019s unlikely that he will ever, as I did, trek all the way across campus on a snowy day to a friend\u2019s dorm room, only to find that person gone but another roommate available, and making a new friend in the process. He won\u2019t have to type and retype his papers \u2014 using Wite-Out, no less! \u2014 to make revisions, finding in that process new insights into what he\u2019s written. I doubt that he\u2019ll make his way to a common room at 9 p.m. every Sunday to watch a specific TV show (\u201cL.A. Law,\u201d I\u2019m thinking of you), bonding with a hearty group of loyalists.\n\nI think fondly of the rabbit holes I disappeared down when I researched papers for history and English because I couldn\u2019t find quite what I was looking for, or because I had to go through so much material to find examples for my thesis. When you can type a few words into a search engine and land on your topic \u2014 or when you can scan a Shakespeare play for specific words or symbols \u2014 what opportunities might you miss to expand your thinking in unexpected ways?\n\nI worry that students today are more connected and more fragmented, learning more about one another from afar but watching programs on their iPads in their rooms. The knowledge they have at their fingertips may make them more productive, but it may also blunt the thrill of unanticipated discovery.\n\nSometime in my first week on that long-ago campus, I found myself hopelessly lost, scrutinizing an indecipherable map, when a freshman boy came up to me. \u201cCan I help you with that?\u201d he asked, and though he didn\u2019t know his way around any better than I did, we figured it out together. Twenty-three years of marriage later, we\u2019re still figuring it out.\n\nAs Hayden navigates his own journey, I wish for him the satisfaction of productivity and the joy of tapping his potential. But I also hope for him at least some of the wide-eyed wonder I felt as a freshman, the delight of discovering a world that was as remote and unknown to me as a foreign country.\n\nAnd I hope he\u2019ll experience the unexpected pleasures of getting lost, of chance encounters, and the incalculable benefits of time wasted for no good reason at all.\n\nChristina Baker Kline, of Montclair, is the author of five novels, including \u201cOrphan Train,\u201d currently on the New York Times trade paperback bestseller list.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@parenting','@perspective','@river'", "title": "Taking my son to college, where technology has replaced serendipity: Opinion", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Taking my son to college, where technology has replaced serendipity: Opinion\", \"link\": \"http://blog.nj.com/njv_guest_blog/2013/09/taking_my_son_to_college_where.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/njv_guest_blog/photo/yalejpg-34b02270b644fd1c.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11157958\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-01T09:44:47Z\", \"author\": \"Star-Ledger Guest Columnist\", \"tags\": [\"@parenting\",\"@perspective\",\"@river\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/njv_guest_blog/photo/13330895-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@NJ_Voices", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Compared with the tools Hayden has at his disposal, I went to college in the Stone Age.
