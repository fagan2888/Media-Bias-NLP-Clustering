The media\u2019s oversight does Americans a disservice. Surprised by Bernie Sanders\u2019s surge in the presidential campaign, the media tends to echo the Clinton campaign\u2019s dismissal of his ideas as unrealistic. In fact, as the CPC budget demonstrates, there is growing political support at all levels for bold ideas that challenge the failed conservative consensus of the previous decades. And those ideas, like Sanders\u2019s, are quite sensible.\n\nThe CPC budget is a detailed and sophisticated document. Prepared in conjunction with the Economic Policy Institute, it is projected in parallel with the Congressional Budget Office baseline. Its assumptions, programs, costs and revenue are laid out for all to see. And it is a ringing indictment of our current course.\n\nLike Sanders, the People\u2019s Budget boldly calls for a new era of public-investment-led growth. The budget supports a $1 trillion, 10-year-plan to rebuild our infrastructure, including a specific provision for addressing the decline in safe water illustrated in the Flint, Mich., calamity. It increases investments dramatically in education from pre-K to debt-free college. It unapologetically increases funds for cracking down on wage theft and enforcing worker rights and environmental protections.\n\nLike Sanders, the CPC calls for progressive taxes and sensible spending savings to pay for its programs. But it also heeds the pleas of establishment institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (made up of the world\u2019s leading economies) that have been begging the United States and other countries to expand public spending to stave off the renewed threat of a global downturn. The CPC frontloads its investments to move the economy rapidly toward real full employment (targeting 4 percent unemployment). Full employment would end the destructive job gap that has persisted since the Great Recession. And at full employment, wages would go up across the board, as workers start to be in demand.\n\nThe People\u2019s Budget also would invest in job training and provide greater support to workers displaced by companies moving abroad. It invests in renewable energy and efficiency. It provides a special provision for jobs in chronically distressed communities, both rural and urban. It expands the earned-income tax credit for childless workers and the child-care tax credit. Americans would have jobs, see their incomes begin to rise and benefit from investments long overdue.\n\nThe CPC also provides a bold call for progressive tax reforms, increasing revenue while cutting ill-conceived tax policies. The CPC\u2019s tax reforms include higher rates at the top, taxing returns on capital at the same rate as income from work and ending the perverse deferral of corporate taxes on profits squirreled abroad. The CPC supports the Robin Hood tax, the tax on financial transactions that would slow down nanosecond, computerized trading. It raises taxes on wealthy estates, and levies a new tax on banks that are too big to fail. It would also put a price on carbon emissions, rebating a portion of that revenue to lower-wage workers. It also saves nearly a half-trillion from health care by empowering Medicare to negotiate lower prices on drugs, creating a public option in Obamacare and reforming our corrupted drug patent and development laws. It would end subsidies to oil, coal and gas companies. By combining smart policies and smart economics, says Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), first vice chair of the CPC, \u201cThe People\u2019s Budget reverses harmful austerity cuts and fixes a system that for far too long has only benefited those at the top.\u201d\n\nThe People\u2019s Budget also takes on wasteful spending. It features a proposal that progressives, responsible moderates and thinking conservatives have embraced: auditing the Pentagon. \u201cAs the only federal agency that cannot be audited, the Pentagon loses tens of billions of dollars annually to waste, fraud, and abuse,\u201d argues the CPC. It would end the blind, across-the-board cuts to the military imposed by the sequester and budget caps. Instead, it would save a similar amount with considered cuts that focus Pentagon spending on modern security threats instead of Cold War-era weapons and contracts, and it would invest in a job-creation program that would help workers transition into civilian jobs. It would also end the off-budget funding of the military\u2019s endless wars after a year, calling for an end to fighting in Afghanistan, while increasing investments in diplomacy, sustainable development, and humanitarian assistance to address the ongoing crises in Syria and Iraq.\n\nAt the end of 10 years, the CPC projects a lower annual deficit and level of debt-to-GDP than either current law or the president\u2019s budget. And remarkably, only the People\u2019s Budget succeeds in returning our spending on domestic programs that are voted on by Congress (discretionary domestic spending) to their historic average as a percent of GDP. The president\u2019s budget, meanwhile, projects a continued unprecedented gutting of the domestic functions of government, from education to environmental protection to the FBI.\n\nThe contrast with Republicans is obvious. The House GOP released a budget that cuts domestic spending to levels lower than they were eight years ago, with the bulk of the cuts coming from programs for the most vulnerable. They would promote fracking, cut funding for renewable energy, end support for Amtrak and urban mass transit, shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, repeal the Affordable Care Act without a plan to replace it and turn Medicaid and food stamps into block grants for the states to savage. They would increase military spending. The Congressional Budget Office warned that under the House proposal, \u201ceconomic output would be lower . . . because differences in federal spending and revenues would reduce total demand for goods and services.\u201d\n\nOver the past decades, conservatives in both parties have failed the vast majority in this country. The CPC People\u2019s Budget, like the Sanders platform, shows there is an alternative. Bold, big reforms can make our lives better. Last year\u2019s version of the People\u2019s Budget had the support of nearly 100 legislators, yet its passage will require, as Sanders argues, a political revolution. What this remarkable document makes clear is that the question is not one of fate, but of policy and power. And more and more Americans are waking up to that.\n\nRead more from Katrina vanden Heuvel\u2019s archive or follow her on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sanders\u2019s rise is proof that there is growing support for ideas that challenge the failed conservative consensus.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000403637764", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Sanders\u2019s rise is proof that there is growing support for ideas that challenge the failed conservative consensus.", "title": "This budget shows that bold, progressive ideas are feasible and sensible", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/this-budget-shows-that-bold-progressive-ideas-are-feasible-and-sensible/2016/03/22/9fe69f00-efb7-11e5-89c3-a647fcce95e0_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/03/22/Editorial-Opinion/Images/516874040.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@KatrinaNation"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/this-budget-shows-that-bold-progressive-ideas-are-feasible-and-sensible/2016/03/22/9fe69f00-efb7-11e5-89c3-a647fcce95e0_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Katrina vanden Heuvel", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000403637764"}, "eomportal-uuid": "9fe69f00-efb7-11e5-89c3-a647fcce95e0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Katrina vanden Heuvel"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd525b\"", "article_summary": "This month, the Congressional Progressive Caucus got far less attention than a random Donald Trump tweet when it released its annual budget \u2014 \u201cThe People\u2019s Budget\u201d \u2014 for fiscal 2017.\nThe CPC People\u2019s Budget, like the Sanders platform, shows there is an alternative.\nIn fact, as the CPC budget demonstrates, there is growing political support at all levels for bold ideas that challenge the failed conservative consensus of the previous decades.\nLike Sanders, the People\u2019s Budget boldly calls for a new era of public-investment-led growth.\nThe CPC budget is a detailed and sophisticated document."}
