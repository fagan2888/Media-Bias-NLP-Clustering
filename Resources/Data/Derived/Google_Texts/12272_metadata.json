(Courtesy of AKOO)\n\nIt\u2019s not until the DJ starts spinning that the back room of the Carolina Kitchen on Rhode Island Avenue in Northeast tips from soul food restaurant to something like a speakeasy. Rapper T.I. (real name Clifford Harris) plans to drop by for dinner before his concert at Echostage, hence the proliferation of spandex (the unforgiving kind) at a place with Southern fried lobster tails on the menu. We managed to squeeze our way past the flashbulbs and clamoring fans to ask the 34-year-old rapper, actor and clothier (his line, AKOO, stands for \u201cA King Onto Oneself\u201d) about the politics of hip-hop.\n\nDo you think hip-hop has a role in politics?\n\nI think hip-hop is the best way to shed light on subjects, whether it\u2019s registering to vote, whether it\u2019s the disparaging treatment of minorities by law officers, or sub-standardized educational systems or just a lack of employment in our communities. Hip-hop is the way that we get these things out there.\n\nAs opposed to what?\n\nWe don\u2019t really necessarily, excuse me, pick up The Washington Post everyday and get our news from that. A lot of times it comes, you know, from a verse spit by your favorite rapper. So I think the hip-hop community, our first responsibility is to shed light.\n\nSo you do have a responsibility?\n\nAbsolutely. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about. It started to speak on the topics that come from the streets because people didn\u2019t know about it. Of course we observed these things a million times in headlines but when you hear it in a song\u2026\n\nWould you like to go to the White House?\n\nI didn\u2019t clear security.\n\nDid you vote for President Obama?\n\nYes.\n\nThe State of the Union is coming up. The president\u2019s approval rating is about 46 percent.\n\nTo be honest with you, given the amount of pushback he\u2019s had on everything that he has tried to do, you know, all those things being considered, I would say, yeah, he did the best he could. I know people who couldn\u2019t even spell insurance now got insurance.\n\nAre you looking ahead to 2016 already?\n\nI\u2019ll wait till they narrow it down and all the other riffraff gets out of the way and we have the final four candidates.\n\nSpeaking of riffraff and critics, I have to ask you about the Twitter wars your artist Iggy Azalea has gotten into lately.\n\nI think Iggy will be just fine, man. She just feels like she needs to answer to everybody and everything and have a rebuttal. Look around your big house and make your music and do your thing. I think the success shall speak for itself.\n\nRead more Reliable Source:\n\nRalph Lauren exec snaps up $4.2 million Georgetown house\n\nKevin Costner and Anthony Mackie have a \u2018very honest\u2019 conversation about race\n\nJill Biden among the guests at book party for NEA\u2019s Lily Eskelsen Garcia\n\nEven more surreal estate, Party Diary and Love, etc: Sign up for The Reliable Source newsletter.
