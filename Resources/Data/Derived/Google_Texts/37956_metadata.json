Rumors Round-Up!\n\nSIGN UP TO RECEIVE THE LATEST NEWS FROM FASHION&STYLE\n\n(Photo : Geoff Pugh/WPA Pool/Getty Images) Prince Harry will finish his tour of duty in the military at the end of 2015 and concentrate on his work helping injured servicemen and women find new jobs or continue to contribute in the services.\n\nHere\u2019s a match made in Anglophile heaven: Prince Harry and Emma Watson!\n\n\n\nThe rumor was sparked by Australian tabloid Women\u2019s Day, which reported that the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d star, 24, and the royal, 30, have been going on secret dates.\n\n\n\nPrince Harry reportedly asked Watson out via a \u201cshort email\u201d and she brought friends along for a group date.\n\n\n\n\"Harry didn't want her to feel like she was put on the spot. A party also shows he\u2019s fun and not stuffy,\u201d a source told Women\u2019s Day (via the Daily Express).\n\n\n\n\"He\u2019s smitten \u2013 and it\u2019s more than Emma's looks.\"\n\n\n\nRELATED: Who Should Prince Harry Date Next?\n\n\n\nHowever, it appears that the rumor is probably too good to be true.\n\n\n\n\"[It's] fake. It's such a random story,\u201d a source told Us Weekly.\n\n\n\n\"I can see the Internet is going mad for this one,\u201d another source added.\n\n\n\nOne thing is true: both stars are (likely) single. Watson split from her boyfriend Matthew Janney in December 2014, while Prince Harry split from his on-again, off-again girlfriend Cressida Bonas in September 2014, though he\u2019s since been linked to model Anastasia Guseva.\n\n\n\nSIGN UP TO RECEIVE THE LATEST NEWS FROM FASHION&STYLE\n\n\u00a9 2015 Fashion & Style.com All rights reserved.
