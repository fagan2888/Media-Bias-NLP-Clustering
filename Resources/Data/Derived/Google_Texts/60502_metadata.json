Expect to see hundreds of thousands of another country\u2019s children walk right through our welcoming open border, counting on America\u2019s families to render all aid. We owe it to ourselves to be prepared \u2013 so, work even harder, working class, while our President uses his trustworthy discernment to redistribute your paycheck, because it IS for the children, after all. And it takes a village, don\u2019t you know?\n\n\u2026.\n\nWe cannot ignore this, and to do so proves you are heartlessly oblivious to the plight of those who, though not willing and able to follow rules or our laws, are expecting a free pass and handout anyway. As a Christian I find it unforgivable to ignore this issue of overrunning border security into these conditions in southern states, and this one issue is just about driving me to renounce my Republican ties because, see, even leaders on the RIGHT side of the aisle haven\u2019t exerted all Constitutional power to stop the madness. A few have tried, but until they\u2019re sent reinforcements, then atrocities like the child abuse and exploitation you\u2019re now getting wind of will only get worse.\n\n\u2026.\n\nSo, how much more will you take, Congress and We the People? I sense not enough guts in D.C. to file impeachment charges against Team Obama for their countless documented illegalities, so the way to stop this is at the ballot box. To fundamentally restore America to her destined exceptionalism you must get involved and then get to that box. Use YOUR phone and pen to support conservative candidates who will fight for what is right: Constitutionally protected freedom, respected military, free markets to create jobs, and secured borders to protect jobs! We need your help to do this; it takes more than a village to fortify the homeland. ANYONE associated with support for Obama\u2019s deceptive ploys that would stoop to using and abusing innocent children must be voted out of office. ANYONE who has shined the boot that Obama\u2019s put on the neck of our economy and security must be held accountable by those with the legal power to do so \u2013 Congress. And then We the People hold Congress accountable.\n\n\u2026.\n\nP.S. I see that HHS is offering a $350 million grant to provide \u201cfamily planning services\u201d to the children here illegally. The primary expenditure we need to supply in this humanitarian crisis is jet fuel to fly these children back home to their parents.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sarah Palin has posted a deranged manifesto that called blamed Obama for the flood on unaccompanied minors that are coming over the US border from Central America, called on the president to be impeached, threatened to leave the Republican Party, and demanded that the minors be flown to Mexico by the US government.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Sarah Palin has posted a deranged manifesto that called blamed Obama for the flood on unaccompanied minors that are coming over the US border from Central America, called on the president to be impeached, threatened to leave the Republican Party, and demanded that the minors be flown to Mexico by th", "title": "Sarah Palin Threatens To Leave The GOP Unless Obama Flies Abandoned Kids to Mexico", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/06/13/sarah-palin-threatens-leave-gop-obama-flies-abandoned-kids-mexico.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/obama-palin-2.jpeg", "updated_time": "2014-06-13T18:05:37+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,impeach obama,palin children illegal immigrants,Palin threatens to leave the republican party,Sarah Palin,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2014-06-13T17:50:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-13T18:05:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "impeach obama, palin children illegal immigrants, Palin threatens to leave the republican party, Sarah Palin"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd972e\"", "article_summary": "Expect to see hundreds of thousands of another country\u2019s children walk right through our welcoming open border, counting on America\u2019s families to render all aid.\nI see that HHS is offering a $350 million grant to provide \u201cfamily planning services\u201d to the children here illegally.\nWe need your help to do this; it takes more than a village to fortify the homeland.\nThe primary expenditure we need to supply in this humanitarian crisis is jet fuel to fly these children back home to their parents.\nAnd it takes a village, don\u2019t you know?"}
