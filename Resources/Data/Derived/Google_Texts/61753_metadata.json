It\u2019s one thing to set up a National Health Service in the wake of World War II. It\u2019s another thing entirely to come 75 years later and completely upend a system that is working pretty well for most people and that enormous institutions have made deep investments in. It\u2019s easy to dismiss this message when coming from Trump, but Atul Gawande has written brilliantly about path dependency in health-care reform and my colleague Sarah Kliff\u2019s masterful profile of Vermont\u2019s failed effort to build a single-payer system further underscores the concerns about path dependency.\u201d \u201cIs the idea that a system could work well in one country but not in the US crazy? Not according to leading health wonk Uwe Reinhardt, who, like Trump, is an admirer of some foreign single-payer systems but skeptical of trying to remake the United States in their image.\u201d\n\nYglesias then goes in to Trump\u2019s idea of a common market \u2014 private \u2014 \u201cwithout the artificial lines around every state.\u201d\n\nThis would allow for greater competition to drive down price, and that\u2019s a point that Yglesias admonished other GOP candidates for not addressing.\n\n\u201cObviously the big question about federalizing insurance regulation is what would the regulations say? This would have been a great issue for other candidates to grill Trump on or offer their own thoughts about. After all, if Trump is as much of a clown as everyone says, surely a serious dialogue about the issues would expose him as an empty suit\u2026. But nobody rose to the challenge.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a little more on Trump\u2019s healthcare ideas.\n\nThe liberal Vox site is not the only progressive media figure to take notice of Trump\u2019s viability. Even his enemy Bill Maher has referred to him as \u201cgenius\u201d and said that he could \u201cgo all the way\u201d to the White House in recent sit-downs.\n\n[Image via Andrew Cline / Shutterstock.com]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The liberal Vox website isn't a place where you would ordinarily come across Donald Trump praise, but columnist Matthew Yglesias, after watching Trump's", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "The liberal Vox website isn\u2019t a place where you would ordinarily come across Donald Trump praise, but columnist Matthew Yglesias, after watching Trump\u2019s", "title": "Liberal \u2018Vox\u2019 Praises Donald Trump Insight On Healthcare Policy At GOP Debate", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2318155/liberal-vox-praises-donald-trump-insight-on-healthcare-policy-at-gop-debate/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Liberal-Vox.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-08T01:04:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-08T01:39:24+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Liberal-Vox.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-08-08T01:04:55+00:00", "fb": {"pages": 71179904752, "app_id": 164157850314499}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "donald trump,donald trump healthcare policy,liberal vox,matthew yglesias,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Liberal-Vox.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The liberal Vox website isn\u2019t a place where you would ordinarily come across Donald Trump praise, but columnist Matthew Yglesias, after watching Trump\u2019s"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "article_summary": "The liberal Vox site is not the only progressive media figure to take notice of Trump\u2019s viability.\nBut nobody rose to the challenge.\u201dHere\u2019s a little more on Trump\u2019s healthcare ideas.\nHowever, Trump cited a detail called \u201cpath dependency\u201d that makes the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and any drive for single-payer unrealistic.\n\u201cWhat Trump is talking about here is path dependency, and it\u2019s a reasonable point.\nThe liberal Vox website isn\u2019t a place where you would ordinarily come across Donald Trump praise, but columnist Matthew Yglesias, after watching Trump\u2019s performance at Thursday\u2019s GOP debate, had plenty of good things to say about the Donald\u2019s healthcare policy ideas."}
