Yet, rather than business as usual, Vitter casts this simple fact as an affront, a special deal for insiders and a symptom of why President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act is rotten to the core.\n\nAnd as his time in Congress ticks down, the two-term Republican senator is showing no sign of letting the issue drop.\n\nJust last week, Vitter blocked Obama\u2019s choice to run the Office of Personnel Management, on the grounds that the agency allows members and their officials staffs to buy insurance on one of the health care act\u2019s exchanges and still obtain a subsidy.\n\nThe technical details of the arrangement are somewhat more complicated, as is Vitter\u2019s legalistic objection. Basically, when Congress passed the health care bill with only Democratic support, it included a provision introduced by Republican U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley, of Iowa, forcing Congress onto the exchanges that were designed for \u2014 and otherwise available only to \u2014 people who don\u2019t get private insurance through their employers, many of whom get government subsidies based on their incomes. Grassley\u2019s amendment was meant as a poison pill, to give pause to Democrats who might not want to trade their cushy government insurance for the presumably inferior product offered on the exchanges. But the Democrats bit, forcing the administration to come up with a convoluted workaround to preserve the benefit. That, in essence, is the so-called special deal to which Vitter objects.\n\nThe underlying politics, though, are simple. Vitter has tried every procedural maneuver in the book to block such efforts and has cast himself as a crusader for taxpayers against entitled government employees who allegedly enjoy special privileges.\n\nThere\u2019s never been any hint that many people share Vitter\u2019s professed outrage, no matter how inflammatory his language can be and how often he cites the fight as evidence of his professed reform-mindedness.\n\nIn fact, about the only folks who do seem to care are his fellow lawmakers and their employees, both Democrat and Republican, some of whom have made little secret of their irritation over being publicly targeted. Some members also have complained that it would be difficult to attract and keep good people on staff without being allowed to offer a basic benefit package. They\u2019ve got a point.\n\nThat makes Vitter\u2019s obsession a strangely self-destructive one, given the recent report from Politico, based on an anonymous tip, that Vitter is putting out feelers with Washington lobbying firms. These firms are generally eager to hire former members like him; the long list of Louisiana congressional veterans who\u2019ve joined their ranks includes such big names as Bob Livingston, Billy Tauzin, John Breaux, J. Bennett Johnston and, most recently, Vitter\u2019s vanquished nemesis, Mary Landrieu.\n\nAll of those politicians, though, spent their time in office building relationships. Vitter has never made doing so a priority, and his continued focus on this issue suggests he\u2019s not about to start.\n\nThat might be an admirable impulse on the surface, if he were poking his colleagues for some greater purpose instead of a partisan stunt.\n\nVitter may contend that he\u2019s motivated by a drive for good government. But nothing he proposes solves a real problem with the Affordable Care Act, of which there are plenty. It wouldn\u2019t save much money. Nor does it address any of the congressional rules or practices that, frankly, could use some real reform.\n\nThe irony is that Vitter once had legitimate reform credentials, dating back to his early days in the Louisiana Legislature. In fact, if the David Vitter of 20 years ago heard rumblings of a sitting lawmaker holding preliminary conversations with lobbying firms, it\u2019s not hard to imagine him calling that person out.\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since Louisiana voters have seen that side of Vitter. And it\u2019s definitely been a while since they\u2019ve had a chance to cheer him on as he aimed all that reformist energy and zeal at something that really mattered.\n\nStephanie Grace can be contacted at sgrace@theadvocate.com.
