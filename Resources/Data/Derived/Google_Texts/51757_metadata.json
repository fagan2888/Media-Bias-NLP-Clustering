Stacey Evans: \u2018The HOPE grant should equal full tuition\u2019\n\nThe Smyrna Democrat eyes changes to Georgia\u2019s gambling-funded tuition program as casino proponents woo state lawmakers.\n\nCourtesy Rep. Stacey Evans\n\nFour years ago, state lawmakers altered HOPE, the merit-based program that uses Georgia Lottery revenue to fund scholarships and grants for prospective college students, because the program was projected to go broke during the recession. The changes they made\u2014reducing how many students qualified and how much they received\u2014are now back up for reconsideration this week as lawmakers listen to casino proponents argue how legalizing table games and slot machines across the state could provide the state with up to $1.5 billion in additional funding for education, healthcare, transportation, and other needs.\n\nState Rep. Stacey Evans, a Democrat from Smyrna who\u2019s played an active role in shaping HOPE, is keeping a close eye on the study committee that\u2019s weighing whether casinos should come to Georgia. In a recent interview, Evans chatted with us about how she would like to see the program retooled, the potential role of casinos in shoring up the state\u2019s academic scholarship program, and why the state would benefit from providing some students with needs-based aid.\n\nWhat changes would you like to see with the HOPE scholarship, which funds a portion of tuition for high school students who graduate with a 3.0 GPA; the Zell Miller Scholarship, which covers full tuition for those with a 3.7 GPA and a 1200 SAT; and the HOPE grant, which offers full technical college tuition for those with a 2.0 GPA?\n\nThe HOPE grant should equal full tuition, and right now it\u2019s just a percentage. The grant is cheaper than the scholarship. It\u2019s needed because we\u2019ve got a skills gap in a lot of the areas where we\u2019re missing the jobs, and unemployed folks are in areas where they can be trained at technical colleges. It\u2019s not all of them, but it\u2019s a lot of them. It\u2019s a real good way to get students in the door, get them out, and get them employed. There\u2019s a $21 million-$23 million price tag\u2014all lottery funds. The lottery is healthy enough to do that with nothing changing.\n\nThe other legislation I\u2019m trying to push hard\u2014and I\u2019ve talked about it with the governor\u2019s office\u2014is a bill that would allow the Zell Miller Scholarship to be given after students get to college. Right now, the only way you can get full tuition to college at a four-year school is to get a 3.7 GPA and 1200 [math and verbal] SAT score. You have one chance to win and that\u2019s at high school graduation. Let\u2019s say you, for whatever reason, didn\u2019t qualify at high school graduation\u2014most likely because of the SAT\u2014but you have the grades to still get into a good college. If you get to school and knock it out of the park, and may even have a 4.0, you can never become eligible for the Zell Miller Scholarship.\n\nI know the stated reason is that we didn\u2019t want to give full tuition to students who were going to drop out and not finish, or lose it by making a 3.0 GPA\u2014Zell Miller Scholars have to make a 3.3 GPA to maintain full tuition. But if you\u2019re doing well in college, it doesn\u2019t really matter what your SAT score is anymore. The bill would allow students who maintain the required GPA of the Zell Miller Scholarship to then become eligible for full tuition.\n\nThe governor seems open to the idea. I think he wants a higher threshold, like a 3.5 GPA [in college]. I\u2019m open to that. The price tag on the bill as I have it drafted\u2014assuming a 3.3 GPA\u2014is about $36 million. That\u2019s more expensive because that\u2019s the scholarship. But it\u2019ll help a lot of kids like me\u2014if I was coming up now, I wouldn\u2019t have qualified for the Zell Miller Scholarship because I had a 3.8 GPA but didn\u2019t have anywhere near the required SAT. But I did really well in college. I would\u2019ve benefited from the bill I\u2019m proposing.\n\nThe lottery is healthy enough to do both of those things right now. Our reserves are about $350 million\u201475 percent higher than it has to be by law\u2014just sitting there, ready to be spent. We know it\u2019s growing by at least $60 million every year. If we can approve the casino bill, that could be an influx of several hundred million dollars more.\n\nThe way the effort to legalize casinos is linked to the HOPE scholarship seems like replay of the push for the Georgia Lottery in the early \u201990s. In that sense, the debate seems to be as much about education policy as it is morality.\n\nYou\u2019ve got to tell people what you\u2019re going to do with this money. You\u2019re going to have to tell voters what you\u2019re going to spend that money on. Obviously, my bills are one idea. The idea of needs-based aid sometimes scares Republicans away. But you could talk about it differently. If you establish a scholarship for first-generation college students, you\u2019re going to capture need because those kids are more likely to qualify if you did a straight-up needs-based scholarship. You could have HOPE be a set dollar amount that would be enough to go to an Albany State University or a Dalton State University without paying out of pocket. But if you were going to go to University of Georgia or Georgia Tech, you might pay more. That\u2019s going to drive poorer students because they\u2019re more likely to choose smaller schools so they can stay close to home.\n\nAnother idea is for HOPE to pay full tuition for someone going to a non-research university, and a certain percentage for those who chose to go to a research university. That would help those who need it the most without saying that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing.\n\nMost of those students are also from metro Atlanta.\n\nExactly. If you go to voters and say we\u2019re going to approve this casino referendum because we\u2019re going to spend more money on HOPE, most people would be scratching their heads. A lot of people don\u2019t realize that HOPE doesn\u2019t cover what it used to. If you showed people how much money the lottery is sitting on\u2014it\u2019s a reserve fund, but it\u2019s growing more than $60 million\u2014people would say you don\u2019t need more money. So we need to be specific: What are we going to do with this money? We may need to come up with another name\u2014I want to call it PACT, Preparing for Advanced Careers Together\u2014and it would allow for students pursuing two-year associate degrees to get full tuition if they agree to a certain number of mentoring and community service hours. It\u2019s similar to the Tennessee Promise scholarship.\n\nSome people have said we should spend the money on Medicaid expansion\u2014not in the Obamacare sense, but on Medicaid\u2014or transportation or something to help rural hospitals. I\u2019m a huge advocate for spending it on those causes, but I don\u2019t think the public would go for that, having just raised the gas tax to pay for transportation. And isn\u2019t the state already supposed to pay for Medicaid? That\u2019s a harder sell than kids.\n\nCasinos were once a nonstarter. But with the lottery\u2019s existence over the past two decades, has opposition in Georgia eroded enough for blackjack and roulette to be welcomed?\n\nYou now can gamble online. Certainly you have more arguments now than you had 20 years ago. You can go on a riverboat in Savannah and gamble. If you haven\u2019t been in a casino, your neighbors have, or family members. MGM or another casino businesses would say their casinos are not just gambling\u2014it\u2019s entertainment, it\u2019s Cirque Du Soleil, it\u2019s shopping.\n\nDo you think there\u2019s an appetite for casino legislation on its own merits?\n\nYou need that second piece. I don\u2019t think it would work as just a bill allowing people to come into the state and generate sales tax revenue. I could be wrong about that, but I think you\u2019re going to need something that makes people feel good about inviting in what most people think of as a vice.\n\nWhat resistance are you anticipating with your proposals?\n\nThere\u2019s an attitude among conservative Republican lawmakers that a HOPE scholarship should be merit-based and not dependent on any kind of need. I don\u2019t know where that comes from\u2014I guess the idea of a perceived handout. But if you give a tuition dollar to a student who needs it, that student will become a productive member of the middle class and pay a lot of money in tax revenue they might not otherwise earn. It\u2019s not fair to tag all Republicans with this, but there\u2019s a school of thought that says, \u201cI paid my way through and you can too.\u201d But tuition is too high now for people to work their way through school and graduate in four years like they did back in the day. People who subscribe to that idea don\u2019t have kids in college, don\u2019t pay those tuition bills, and they\u2019re thinking about a reality from a long time ago. There\u2019s a hesitancy of letting government be part of a solution.\n\nFor those reasons, it\u2019s safer for everybody if we say it another way. There are enough Republicans who think there\u2019s a need for helping students\u2014and who want to help the least of us\u2014but don\u2019t want to say it that way. You\u2019re going to need two-thirds [of lawmakers\u2019 support]. The conventional wisdom is that you need all the Democrats and a fair number of Republicans to get this done. You\u2019re not going to get all the Democrats if this isn\u2019t money returned to the community in need. Why would we do that?\n\nWhat are you keeping your eye on with this week\u2019s hearings?\n\nThe folks who have an interest in pushing the casino bill simply for business reasons need to think long and hard about what we\u2019re going to spend the money on. If you don\u2019t worry about that on the front end, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to pass. You have to spend that cash on something that people want. Otherwise you\u2019re not going to get to the part where you have your business interests served. I\u2019m not sure those dots are connected right now.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.categories": "News & Opinion,", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2015/09/407705_355941151084199_580017301_n-300x300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Max Blau", "description": "The Smyrna Democrat eyes changes to Georgia\u2019s gambling-funded tuition program as casinos proponents woo state lawmakers.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "sailthru.link": "http://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/rep-stacey-evans-on-the-future-of-georgias-scholarship-program-hope-should-equal-full-tuition/", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Magazine", "description": "The Smyrna Democrat eyes changes to Georgia\u2019s gambling-funded tuition program as casinos proponents woo state lawmakers.", "title": "Rep.
