Hodges brings into question whether marriage equality is a Constitutional right. Florida has already legalized same-sex marriage.\n\nIn King v. Burwell the Supreme Court will decide to uphold or invalidate a provision of the Affordable Care Act, also known as \"Obamacare.\"\n\nFlorida has the highest number of sign-ups in the nation under the Affordable Care Act within the federal exchange.\n\nDuring an appearance on WJCT's \u201cFirst Coast Connect,\u201d Greg Pingree, professor at Florida Coastal School of Law, and Nicholas Seabrook, professor at UNF, discussed the possible outcomes for the two cases.\n\nBoth Pingree and Seabrook say it\u2019s highly likely that the Supreme Court will decide in favor of same-sex marriage.\n\nSeabrook says Justice Anthony Kennedy is likely to be the fifth and decisive vote in favor of same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been actually the author of each of the most significant gay rights decisions that the supreme court has issued,\u201d Seabrook said.\n\nPingree says Chief Justice John Roberts is concerned with his legacy, and that will play a role in his decision making.\n\n\u201cThis is something that possibly down the line is going to be seen something like Plessy v. Ferguson,\u201d Pingree said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be on the wrong side of history.\u201d\n\nSeabrook says he agrees with the assertion that Roberts is concerned with his legacy. He says Roberts will be on the side of maintaining the Affordable Care Act because it looks very bad for the court if they\u2019re potentially taking healthcare away from millions of Americans.\n\nPingree says he also thinks leaving Americans uninsured will have an impact on the court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cOf course the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions always have social consequences, and so there\u2019s nothing new about that, but it just looks bad,\u201d Pingree said. \u201cI think that the court is always concerned about its image, and that has to be something that\u2019s weighing in on them.\u201d\n\nSeabrook says there are several more complications with this case on Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThis is, I think, a case where the outcome is much more in doubt than the same-sex marriage case,\u201d Seabrook said.\n\nBoth decisions will have an impact across Florida and the nation as a whole.\n\nListen to the full conversation with Greg Pingree and Nicholas Seabrook on Thursday\u2019s episode of the \u201cFirst Coast Connect\u201d podcast on iTunes or Stitcher.\n\nPhoto credit: \"scotus 20829\" by Ted Eytan is used under CC BY-SA 2.0.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to make decisions by the end of this month on two controversial cases about same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://news.wjct.org/post/floridians-weigh-impact-upcoming-scotus-decisions-gay-marriage-obamacare", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wjct/files/styles/medium/public/201506/scotus_20829.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to make decisions by the end of this month on two controversial cases about same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care", "title": "Floridians Weigh Impact Of Upcoming SCOTUS Decisions On Gay Marriage, Obamacare"}, "story_id": 413709274, "twitter": {"site": "@WJCTJax", "card": "summary", "creator": "@mfranmac"}, "author": "Mary McIntyre", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Floridians Weigh Impact Of Upcoming SCOTUS Decisions On Gay Marriage, Obamacare"}, "nid": 22397, "datePublished": "2015-06-11", "keywords": "U.S. Supreme Court, same-sex marriage, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act", "wordCount": 588, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Florida has the highest number of sign-ups in the nation under the Affordable Care Act within the federal exchange.\nIn King v.
