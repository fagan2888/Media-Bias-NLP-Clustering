Bernie Sanders is cutting campaign staff as his White House hopes dim, but some S.C. Democrats backing the U.S. senator from Vermont are not willing \u2013 yet \u2013 to concede the fight for their party\u2019s presidential nomination.\n\nStill, S.C. Democratic Party chairman Jaime Harrison called Saturday for solidarity as Democrats gathered for their state convention to choose the delegates who will help pick the party\u2019s nominee in July.\n\n\u201cWe have to remember who and what we\u2019re fighting for,\u201d said Harrison, one of six S.C. superdelegates to the Philadelphia convention. Harrison pledged his support for Clinton after she won the state\u2019s primary in a 3-to-1 rout.\n\nAs Republicans decide their nominee, \u201cWe cannot allow ourselves to be divided and allow them to win,\u201d Harrison said.\n\nMore than 1,000 S.C. Democrats showed up Saturday at the Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center to elect delegates to the Democratic National Convention.\n\nU.S. Labor Secretary Tom Perez, mentioned in his some circles as possible vice presidential candidate, gave the keynote address. Attendees also heard from the party\u2019s lineup of candidates for the U.S. House and Senate.\n\nAnother Clinton supporter, U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-Columbia, also made attempts to soothe any tensions that might be left between Clinton and Sanders supporters.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a thing but respect for Bernie Sanders,\u201d said the U.S. House assistant Democratic leader, adding Sanders was his go-to senator to get support for community health care centers in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCalling for unity, Clyburn said, \u201cWe cannot get so upset about the results of the primary that we lose sight of what needs to happen in November.\u201d\n\nSanders supporters from Columbia and elsewhere in Clyburn\u2019s 6th District sat in a sparsely filled cluster of chairs in part of the convention center\u2019s ballroom. Across the aisle, Clinton\u2019s supporters packed chairs that filled an entire side of the room.\n\nWhile a lineup of candidates ran to fill seven delegate positions for Clinton in the 6th District, only 10 people were vying for the single spot from the district available for a Sanders supporter. But, under Democratic Party gender equity rules, that Sanders spot had to be filled by a man, narrowing the field of candidates to four.\n\nThree of the candidates vying to be the Sanders delegate said that if they won the spot, they likely would vote for Clinton \u2013 if Sanders dropped out of the race and released them from their obligation to vote for the U.S. senator.\n\nHowever, the fourth would-be Sanders delegate was wavering.\n\n\u201cI understand that we all want to see a Democrat elected,\u201d said Wayne Borders, a Columbia activist who campaigned for Sanders. \u201cI want to support a Democrat. I want to support a woman. But I just personally don\u2019t believe that Hillary Clinton is that candidate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still struggling to find my passion for supporting Clinton.\u201d\n\nIf Sanders drops out, Borders said, he would follow the candidate\u2019s cue to \u201csupport who he would endorse.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would just be a matter of just good solidarity and cohesion within his campaign structure really, more so than any kind of burning passion for (Clinton),\u201d he said.\n\nAfter the votes were counted, Hopkins resident Lawrence Moore snagged the 6th District delegate seat supporting Sanders. An active member of the party for three decades, Moore said there is \u201cmore than one solidarity\u201d Democrats should keep in mind. There also should be solidarity in backing \u201cour political revolution,\u201d he said, referring to Sanders\u2019 repeated pledge to transform the U.S. political system.\n\nA lot of young Democrats and new people have become involved in politics as a result of the Sanders campaign, Moore said.\n\n\u201cWe want to keep that enthusiasm. We want to keep those people on board, and the main way to do that is to champion the issues that brought them to Sen. Sanders in the first place.\u201d\n\nAt Saturday\u2019s convention, state Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, D-Orangeburg, sat in a chair placed intentionally apart from Clinton or Sanders supporters. Cobb-Hunter, a superdelegate to the national convention, said she plans to remain neutral until there is a clear nominee.\n\n\u201cI love the passion\u201d the campaigns have brought to the contest, she said.\n\nHowever, she added, \u201cI strongly suggest that if Sen. Sanders plans to continue (in the race) that he ratchet down the rhetoric because what he is doing in the attacks on (former) Secretary (of State) Clinton is simply helping Republicans in November.\u201d\n\nThe negative attacks, she said, \u201cwill make it harder to bring people together.\u201d\n\nTo others, the tensions between the Sanders\u2019 and Clinton\u2019s camps do not seem so bad \u2013 especially compared to the Republican race.\n\nIt\u2019s been \u201cvery mannered\u201d and \u201cwell-behaved\u201d on the Democratic side, said Sanders supporter Stephen Hait of Columbia, adding it\u2019s time for Sanders to \u201cswitch gears.\u201d\n\nAsked when Sanders should wrap up his campaign, Sanders supporter Russell Wilcox of Columbia responded, \u201cLast Tuesday,\u201d when Sanders lost four primaries. Not long after, the Sanders campaign announced it was laying off hundreds of staffers.\n\nAiken Democrat Ann Willbrand said she did not seen any animosity between Clinton and Sanders supporters at Saturday\u2019s gathering.\n\nS.C. Democrats are \u201cvery adamant about their candidates. But I think reasonable people will come together,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf not, they\u2019re sour grapes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "SCNow", "description": "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- U.S. Sen.
