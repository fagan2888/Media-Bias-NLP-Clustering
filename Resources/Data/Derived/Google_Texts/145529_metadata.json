Superstar. How awesome would it be if J.R. \u201cSwish\u201d Smith made a big impact for Cleveland in the NBA Finals. The sports world, specifically fans in Colorado, would lose it. LOL.\n\nJeremiah, Fayetteville, Ark.\n\nKiz: Without the presence of Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving, both felled by season-ending injuries during Cleveland\u2019s run for a championship, the Cavaliers are way too reliant upon LeBron James, in the same way the banged-up Broncos were way too dependent on Peyton Manning in that ugly Super Bowl loss against Seattle. For every 3-pointer J.R. swishes, he makes two bonehead plays. I originally believed Golden State would win the series in six games. Now, it might be impossible even for a player as great as James to steal more than one victory.\n\nNo action on Jackson. How come there\u2019s never any mention of Mark Jackson as head coach of the Nuggets? He would be able to attract stars to Denver.\n\nJesse, Colorado proud\n\nKiz: During the 2013 NBA playoff series that helped Golden State grow into the championship contender we see today and saw a 57-victory Denver team exposed as not ready for prime time, there were whispers from Nuggets personnel that Jackson was a little more than a figurehead on the Golden State bench and Warriors assistant Michael Malone was the real brains of the basketball operation. Malone had a brief stint as head coach of Sacramento. He\u2019s not as famous as Jackson, known for exclaiming \u201cMama, there goes that man!\u201d on NBA telecasts, but Malone has been interviewed for Denver\u2019s coaching vacancy.\n\nRoot for the home team. Kiz, critical columns like yours take the pure joy out of rooting for our Rockies. There are a million reasons not to believe in them, and you are never shy about pointing them out. For those of us who believe in supporting our local ballclub, it\u2019s sad to read your bashing of a team we didn\u2019t have not so long ago.\n\nRon, Westminster\n\nKiz: The Rockies were born in 1993. During their existence, I\u2019ve had a child learn to read, learn to drive, learn how to do laundry at college and learn how to get full-time job. And, in those 22 years, the Rockies still have not learned how to win a division title.\n\nRockies\u2019 big decision. And today\u2019s parting shot asks our local National League team to think outside the box in the Major League Baseball draft Monday.\n\nWhom do the Rockies draft at No. 3 in the first round? Which position? Maybe draft a new owner?\n\nMike, likes beer for breakfast\n\nMark Kiszla: mkiszla@denverpost.com or twitter.com/markkiszla", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kickin\u2019 it with Kiz: LeBron James is great, but the NBA Finals is a team sport", "title": "Kickin\u2019 it with Kiz: LeBron James is great, but the NBA Finals is a team sport", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/06/kickin-it-with-kiz-lebron-james-is-great-but-the-nba-finals-is-a-team-sport/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150605_041440_lebron-james.jpg", "height": 451}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150605_041440_lebron-james.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-06T20:36:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T02:40:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Kickin' It With Kiz"}, "article_summary": "I originally believed Golden State would win the series in six games.\nHow awesome would it be if J.R. \u201cSwish\u201d Smith made a big impact for Cleveland in the NBA Finals.\nNow, it might be impossible even for a player as great as James to steal more than one victory.\nDuring their existence, I\u2019ve had a child learn to read, learn to drive, learn how to do laundry at college and learn how to get full-time job.\nAnd today\u2019s parting shot asks our local National League team to think outside the box in the Major League Baseball draft Monday."}
