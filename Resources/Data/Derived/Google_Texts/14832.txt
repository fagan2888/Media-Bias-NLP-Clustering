In the wake of U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn II’s ruling that Kentucky’s ban on recognizing same-sex unions from other states is unconstitutional, gay marriage has suddenly become a major issue in the conservative Bluegrass State.

It’s happening on both sides of the aisle, too. On the Democratic side, Kentucky’s Dem attorney general, Jack Conway, recently announced he would not personally represent the state in its appeal (outside counsel will instead). For Republicans, meanwhile, the issue has become most prominent through a radio ad from the Senate Conservatives Fund, a Tea Party group that’s backing Sen. Mitch McConnell’s primary opponent, businessman Matt Bevin.

In the ad, two assumedly regular Kentucky Republicans discuss Heyburn’s ruling, describing the George H.W. Bush-appointed judge as “liberal” and blaming McConnell for recommending him way back in the early 1990s.

“Unbelievable! Liberal Judge John Heyburn just ruled that Kentucky has to immediately recognize same-sex marriages from other states,” says an unnamed woman in the beginning of the ad.

“Is that the same judge who overturned the ban on partial-birth abortions?” asks a man in response.

“Yep.”

“Who recommended this liberal judge?”

“Mitch McConnell.”
