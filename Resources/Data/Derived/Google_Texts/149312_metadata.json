The Giffords, who both grew up in Clifton Park, N.Y., declined, citing their religious beliefs that marriage is between one man and one woman.\n\nBecause Liberty Ridge Farm is open to the public for seasonal activities, such as its annual fall festival, the state of New York classifies it as a public accommodation that cannot discriminate on the basis of certain personal characteristics, including sexual orientation.\n\nThe lesbian couple, who recorded a telephone conversation with Cynthia Gifford, complained to the New York State Division of Human Rights, which is specifically chartered to prohibit \u201cdiscrimination\u201d based upon sexual orientation, among other characteristics.\n\nIn July, an administrative law judge found the Giffords had discriminated against the couple and ordered fines totaling $13,000\u2014$1,500 mental anguish fine to each of the women and a $10,000 civil damages penalty to the state.\n\nThe Giffords didn\u2019t know about the official complaint until a TV reporter showed up to interview them about it.\n\n\u201cThere was the reporter and the camera person, and I thought, \u2018Oh great, we\u2019re going to get some publicity about our fall festival,\u2019\u201d Cynthia Gifford recalled. \u201cAnd the reporter asked if we could step away from the customers\u2014I did not understand why.\u201d\n\nThe state human rights commissioner\u2019s final order Aug. 8 required the Giffords to pay the $13,000 within 60 days, plus accrued interest of $195. The Giffords also had 60 days in which to appeal the ruling.\n\nGifford told The Daily Signal this week in an exclusive interview that she and her husband decided to fight the charges because they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the judge\u2019s narrow view of both the evidence and the law.\n\nTheir attorney, James Trainor, who is associated with Alliance Defending Freedom, said the family was \u201cappealing every facet of the judge\u2019s decision\u201d and that he is confident their \u201cconstitutional rights and religious beliefs will be fully considered.\u201d\n\nMelisa Erwin and Jennifer McCarthy, the lesbian couple who filed the complaint, declined comment to The Daily Signal. They did speak out in a 2012 interview with WNYT.\n\nThe Giffords\u2019 refusal to book their wedding ceremony \u201cmakes you feel like people out there are judging and think [a same-sex marriage] is wrong,\u201d Erwin said.\n\n\u201cPeople are people and everyone should be treated fairly,\u201d added McCarthy.\n\nThe Giffords contend their decision was not about the couple\u2019s sexual orientation but about upholding their own religiously based views on marriage.\n\n\u201cWe open our doors for a certain part of the year for everyone to come and enjoy God\u2019s country that we\u2019re so blessed to live on,\u201d Cynthia Gifford said.\n\n\u201cWe feel the judge did not consider our religious beliefs or the Constitution, so we were very disappointed in that fact and decided to appeal hoping we would have the opportunity for a court to consider our religious rights and constitutional rights,\u201d she said.\n\nWe just believe that a marriage is between a man and a woman, and we do not want to hold a [same-sex] marriage ceremony here on our family farm because the state tells us we have to do it.\n\n>>> Farmers to Lesbian Couple: \u2018We\u2019re Not Hateful People\u2019\n\nThe $13,000 in fines \u201ctook a punch financially on us,\u201d Cynthia Gifford said, and led them to another decision that will cost them more money: to stop holding wedding ceremonies at Liberty Ridge Farm.\n\nOtherwise, she said, the Giffords would be required to institute anti-discrimination re-education classes and procedures for their staff.\n\nThe Giffords will continue to hold receptions at the farm, she said, but the decision \u201cis likely to affect our business dramatically\u201d since most area couples book ceremonies and receptions together.\n\n>>> Read More: Government to Farmers: Host Same-Sex Wedding or Pay a $13,000 Fine\n\nMariko Hirose, the lawyer for Erwin and McCarthy, declined to comment for The Daily Signal. In a previous interview with Religion News Service, Hirose said:\n\nAll New Yorkers are entitled to their own religious beliefs, but businesses cannot discriminate based on sexual orientation any more than they can based on race or national origin.\n\nLourdes Centeno, director of external relations at the New York State Division of Human Rights, declined to comment, saying \u201cthe order is out and that\u2019s all we have available at the moment in terms of public information.\u201d\n\nTrainor, who doesn\u2019t expect a ruling on the appeal until next July, said he will build his case around guarantees of religious freedom and free speech built into the federal and state constitutions.\n\n[The judge\u2019s decision] is forcing them to both practice their beliefs a certain way, as well as express or speak an affirmation of the state\u2019s version of marriage by hosting these things in their home. What does that tell an observer? That they totally agree with it\u2014that they\u2019re totally in favor of it. So it forces that type of speech but it also doesn\u2019t allow them to carry out and practice their own religious belief that marriage was designed to be, by God, between one man and one woman.\n\nRyan T. Anderson, who researches and writes about marriage and religious liberty as the William E. Simon Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, echoed Trainor\u2019s argument.\n\n\u201cWhile Americans are free to live as they choose, no one should demand that government coerce others into celebrating their relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cAll Americans should remain free to believe and act in the public square based on their beliefs about marriage without fear of government penalty.\u201d\n\n>>> Read More: Protecting Religious Liberty in the State Marriage Debate\n\nAsked what she would say to Erwin and McCarthy about the Giffords\u2019 decision to appeal, Cynthia Gifford said: \u201cI would hope that they would understand that we respect everyone for who they are, and that we would like to have respect for our religious beliefs to be acknowledged as well.\u201d\n\n[This story was modified to correctly describe the deadline for the Giffords to pay the fines and appeal.]", "article_metadata": {"description": "A couple who declined to host a same-sex wedding ceremony on their family farm is fighting \"every facet\" of a recent discrimination ruling against them.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A couple who declined to host a same-sex wedding ceremony on their family farm is fighting \"every facet\" of a recent discrimination ruling against them.", "title": "N.Y.
