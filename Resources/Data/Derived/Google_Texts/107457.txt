With millions of newly insured patients expected to fill up the waiting rooms of doctors’ offices as healthcare reform is implemented, medical malpractice insurers may have reason for concern about the law’s impact on liability trends.

The catalyst for increased utilization is the controversial mandate included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)—better known as “Obamacare”—requiring all individuals to have health insurance starting in 2014, or pay a penalty via their federal income tax form. Subsidies will be made available to help those with affordability issues, and Medicaid is being expanded in most states as well.
