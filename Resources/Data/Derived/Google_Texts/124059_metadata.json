Mark DeSaulnier (D-Richmond), who serves on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Judy Chu (D-Los Angeles), of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet, and Anna Eshoo (D-Palo Alto), who also serves, as a ranking subcommittee member, on the Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n\nThe members wrote a letter to Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee today, calling on the state health exchange to take exceptional care in a proposed data-mining operation that will provide more information about health care consumers in the state.\n\n\u201cWe understand how critical it is to uphold the highest quality of care possible for patients; however, we are concerned about the cybersecurity and privacy risks involved in collecting such a large volume of sensitive data,\u201d the letter read in part.\n\nThe members were troubled by recent cyberattacks on California patients. The attacks included the hack of nearly 19 million Americans who used Anthem and Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurance, and a recent hack of the UCLA hospital system that has endangered the records of more than 4 million Californians.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act has allowed thousands of Californians to get good, affordable health care,\u201d said C\u00e1rdenas. \u201cTo improve coverage and care, we have to better understand them as health care consumers. However, we know that hackers are focusing on health records. The state and Covered California absolutely must take every step possible to ensure these records are completely protected during any data mining operations.\u201d\n\nAccording to a study conducted by the Ponemon Institute, more than 1.84 million people were affected by medical identity theft in 2012, a number expected to continue rising.\n\nLast year, C\u00e1rdenas passed an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that required the Department of Defense to work with the Small Business Administration to research the need for cyberattack education and training in small businesses throughout the United States.\n\nSign up to stay up-to-date with Congressman C\u00e1rdenas:\n\nhttps://cardenas.house.gov/contact/newsletter", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "cybercrime, government, healthcare, anthem data breach, covered california, cybersecurity, u.s. rep. tony cardenas, business, politics", "author": "Christopher Simmons", "og": {"site_name": "California Newswire", "description": "SAN FERNANDO, Calif. /California Newswire/ -- Today, following his work in the San Fernando Valley that saw more than 1,000 area families enrolled in healt, by Christopher Simmons", "title": "Congressman Cardenas calls on Calif.
