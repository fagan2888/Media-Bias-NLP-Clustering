Obamacare customers with low and moderate incomes qualify for subsidies that reduces the price of their monthly insurance premiums, and many of those customers also get additional financial help paying for their out-of-pocket medical expenses.\n\n\"The deadline is fast approaching and ... we're here to help them enroll, so they don't risk having to pay a penalty,\" Burwell said.\n\nThe Obamacare penalty for not having some form of health coverage in 2016 is rising to the higher of $695 per adult or 2.5 percent of household income.\n\nBurwell and other health officials have repeatedly mentioned that penalty during enrollment this year to spur remaining uninsured people to sign up.\n\nBurwell previously has noted the remaining uninsured will be tougher to enroll than in Obamacare's first two years. She expects that about 10 million people will still be enrolled in Obamacare plans nationwide by the end of this year, which would represent just a modest increase in enrollment as of the end of 2015.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "People who don't sign up for insurance by Sunday face a potential penalty of at least $695.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "People who don't sign up for insurance by Sunday face a potential penalty of at least $695.", "title": "HealthCare.gov sign-ups near 9M with deadline near", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/27/obamacare-healthcaregov-sign-ups-close-in-on-9m.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/11/12/103164645-GettyImages-495382986.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People who don't sign up for insurance by Sunday face a potential penalty of at least $695.", "title": "Obamacare: HealthCare.gov sign-ups close in on 9M", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/27/obamacare-healthcaregov-sign-ups-close-in-on-9m.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/11/12/103164645-GettyImages-495382986.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, Obamacare, Health Insurance, United States, Connecticut, Politics, US: News, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-01-27T15:44:38-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2016-01-27T15:44:39-0500", "tag": "US: News"}, "pageNodeId": 103338541, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, health insurance, HealthCare.gov, Affordable Care Act"}, "article_summary": "Burwell also said, \"We are focused on making sure people know that financial help\" is available to buy Obamacare plans.\nBurwell previously has noted the remaining uninsured will be tougher to enroll than in Obamacare's first two years.\nThe Obamacare penalty for not having some form of health coverage in 2016 is rising to the higher of $695 per adult or 2.5 percent of household income.\nBurwell and other health officials have repeatedly mentioned that penalty during enrollment this year to spur remaining uninsured people to sign up.\nShe expects that about 10 million people will still be enrolled in Obamacare plans nationwide by the end of this year, which would represent just a modest increase in enrollment as of the end of 2015."}
