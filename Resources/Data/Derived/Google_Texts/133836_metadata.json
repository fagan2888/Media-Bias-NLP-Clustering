As an entitlement program, Medicaid plays an important role,\u201d said Kayla Rosenfeld, a state Department of Human Services spokeswoman.\n\nThe Medicaid program is jointly funded by the federal government and states, according to Medicaid.gov, with the federal government paying states for a specified percentage of program expenditures \u2014 the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage. The percentage varies by state based on criteria such as per capita income, averaging about 57 percent but going as high as 82 percent.\n\nCriteria for Medicaid recipients depends on the eligibility group, which can include children, pregnant women, parents and other caretaker relatives, adults, individuals determined on the basis of being aged, blind, or disabled, Rosenfeld said.\n\nUnder new federal guidelines established under President Obama, recipients have no limits on assets, but for the new eligibility group authorized under the ACA, adults must have an income at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, Rosenfeld said.\n\nTo handle the expected boom in enrollment under the Affordable Care Act, the Department was awarded a $100 million federal grant to build an \u201celigibility system\u201d to process the applications.\n\nThe state hired KPMG, which built the online web portal KOLEA, enhanced the State\u2019s IT infrastructure and added new functionality such as document imaging. The state contracted with the company to perform maintenance and operations over the next two years.\n\nWhile state legislators said Tuesday in a House hearing they\u2019ve gotten complaints about the system, Rosenfeld said KOLEA processed 250,000 individual eligibility determinations and redeterminations between Oct. 1 and June 30.\n\nTimeliness in processing applications has also improved, Rosenfeld said, noting as of June the average application approval takes 13 days, compared with 32 days in previous months.\n\nThe state has appropriated another $400,000 for the program for this fiscal year to enhance DHS operations and policies surrounding security for the system, including determining who should have access, Rosenfeld said. The state has issued a request-for-information proposal to solicit private bidders on the project.\n\nHawaii\u2019s political landscape is largely dominated by Democrats, which control the state administration, the Legislature and its congressional seat. There are no Republicans in Congress and just eight in a state Legislature of 76 . The majority of Hawaii\u2019s elected politicians believe heavy dependence on Medicaid is a positive step for Hawaii; their goal is to eliminate the state\u2019s remaining 6 percent who are uninsured.\n\nOther federal and state subsidies are heavily used in Hawaii, including SNAP or food stamps. As of June, 194,865 people and 99,320 households received SNAP benefits, Rosenfeld said.\n\nAn August 2013 report by Cato Institute, which examines the state-by-state value of welfare for a mother of two, said benefits in Hawaii average $49,175 \u2014 tops in the nation.\n\n\n\nMichael Tanner, co-author of the Cato study, said that since welfare isn\u2019t taxed, a person would have to earn $60,590 in Hawaii to take home the $49,175 for someone on welfare.\n\nPart of the plan for the Department\u2019s new and improved eligibility system web portal \u2013 and the state\u2019s Obamacare web site, HawaiiHealthConnector.com \u2014 involves qualifying even more people for Medicaid and other government benefits through a one-stop shop.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "MEDICAID: Of Hawaii\u2019s 1.3 million people, some 320,000 qualify for the government health-care program.
