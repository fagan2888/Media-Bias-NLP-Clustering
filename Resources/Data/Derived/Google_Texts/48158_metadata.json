Chances are you haven\u2019t, but a pair of psychologists did and what they concluded actually makes pretty good sense. Apparently, walking in military formation not only intimidates the enemy, but also makes the men doing the walking feel more powerful and possibly more aggressive.\n\nMost uniformed military units march into combat in a singular motion. A pair of University of California, Los Angeles, social scientists hypothesized that walking in step may slightly alter the mindset of the marchers, according to a press release. To test out their theory, the researchers recruited 98 male undergrads and had them march around campus in lockstep, and had the other half casually stroll about. Afterward, each participant was given a series of tests to determine how threatened the men felt during their parade, without asking them directly. For example, the men were shown photographs of other men\u2019s angry faces and were asked to estimate their height.\n\nResults showed that the undergrads who walked in unison judged the angry faces as \u201csignificantly less physically imposing\u201d than those who walked about casually. This led the researchers to conclude that moving in a synchronized manner made men perceive an opponent as less intimidating. \u201cIf we had more people marching together, and if they had marched together repeatedly like police and the military do in drills, we would have expected a stronger effect,\u201d coauthor Colin Holbrook explained in the press release.\n\nA 2012 study from the same university found that marching in unison not only gives men confidence but may also lead them to act more aggressively. \u201cExperiencing moving in unison with another person appears to make us paint a less threatening picture of a potential assailant,\u201d said Daniel Fessler, coauthor of the study. \u201cThey loom less large and formidable in the mind\u2019s eye. Simply walking in sync may make men more likely to think, \u2018Yeah, we could take that guy!\u2019\u201d This phenomenon is observed in other species as well \u2014 dolphins, for example. Those that swim in tight packs are more likely to win fights with other dolphins.\n\nNow, while it\u2019s important for soldiers to be aggressive when marching into battle, it\u2019s questionable whether this same tactic is as useful in the police force. Also, the researchers declined to choose sides over whether or not the police should use the same militarized techniques as the army, but they did offer their opinion on the matter. \"The military mission is an \u2018us vs. them\u2019 mission. \u2026 But that\u2019s not the mission of civilian police forces. The motto is \u2018protect and serve.\u2019 \u2026 When we train them the way we train soldiers, we run the risk that we\u2019re eliciting an \u2018us vs. them\u2019 psychology,\u201d Kessler said, The Washington Post reported.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "men, feel, more, powerful, when, marching, sync, does, it, also, make, them, more, inclined", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Researchers from UCLA conducted a social experiment to see how men felt when marching in unison, and turns out they feel pretty much invincible.", "title": "Researchers Suggest Marching In Unison May Make Men More Prone To Aggression", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/men-feel-more-powerful-when-marching-sync-does-it-also-make-them-more-inclined-violence-300598", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/29/military.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers from UCLA conducted a social experiment to see how men felt when marching in unison, and turns out they feel pretty much invincible.", "title": "Researchers Suggest Marching In Unison May Make Men More Prone To Aggression", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/men-feel-more-powerful-when-marching-sync-does-it-also-make-them-more-inclined-violence-300598", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/29/military.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/29/military.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2014-08-29T16:12:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-29T16:12:32-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Researchers from UCLA conducted a social experiment to see how men felt when marching in unison, and turns out they feel pretty much invincible."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbbf3\"", "article_summary": "Apparently, walking in military formation not only intimidates the enemy, but also makes the men doing the walking feel more powerful and possibly more aggressive.\nEver wonder if there was something other than tradition that caused men to move in unison when marching into battle.\n\"The military mission is an \u2018us vs. them\u2019 mission.\nA 2012 study from the same university found that marching in unison not only gives men confidence but may also lead them to act more aggressively.\nThis led the researchers to conclude that moving in a synchronized manner made men perceive an opponent as less intimidating."}
