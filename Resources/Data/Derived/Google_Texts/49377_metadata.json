Xiaomei Chen/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nMOUNT AIRY, N.C. \u2014 In this picturesque town of 10,000 people near the North Carolina\u2013Virginia border, the inspiration for the fictional Mayberry on \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show\u201d where people tend to pepper their sentences with \u201choney\u201d and \u201csweetie,\u201d residents are angry.\n\nThey are angry that the government is still shut down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m disgusted that they can\u2019t get a handle on it and they can\u2019t cooperate with each other to get the Americans\u2019 needs met,\u201d said Dennis Williams, 56, a retired CIA agent who works at Talley\u2019s Custom Frame and Gallery downtown.\n\nThey are angry about the fiscal state of affairs in the country.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, the president, the vice president, all the administrators, all of the federal judges, every congressman, every senator should do without their pay until we have reduced the debt,\u201d fumed Sylvia Lowry, 56, a voice teacher at Olde Mill Music. \u201cWhen I was in debt, you know who paid it back? I stinkin\u2019 did, and you know how I did it? I cut back. Every nincompoop can tell you what to do. They\u2019re just not willing to do it.\u201d\n\nThey are angry at President Barack Obama and about the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which most confess they do not fully understand.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s not willing to do anything. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s a dictator,\u201d said Janan Blankowski, 50, a sales associate at the general store. \u201c(House Speaker John) Boehner and the Republicans only want to extend it a year so normal people can figure out what it is and what they want. What\u2019s the rush?\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re so mad that sometimes they tune out the other side completely.\n\n\u201cIt takes two to make such a big mess,\u201d Evelyn Newman, 67, confessed while Fox News played on the television in her restaurant, the Blue Bird Diner. \u201cI don\u2019t like Obama very much, so I don\u2019t listen to him a lot.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Residents hate the Affordable Care Act, the debt and government dysfunction; they like their congressman", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/11/-mayberry-illustrateswhywashingtonscrisesarehardtosolve.html", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/10/11/-mayberry-illustrateswhywashingtonscrisesarehardtosolve/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.mt_airy_101113.1381541238616.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article", "description": "Residents hate the Affordable Care Act, the debt and government dysfunction; they like their congressman", "title": "In 'Mayberry,' a glimpse of why a Washington crisis is hard to crack"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/10/11/-mayberry-illustrateswhywashingtonscrisesarehardtosolve/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.mt_airy_101113.1381541238616.jpg", "title": "In 'Mayberry,' a glimpse of why a Washington crisis is hard to crack", "site": "@AJAM", "card": "summary", "description": "Residents hate the Affordable Care Act, the debt and government dysfunction; they like their congressman"}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "keywords": "Politics, Shutdown, Congress, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8294\"", "article_summary": "The town of Mount Airy, N.C., is known not only for Andy Griffith but also for its classic architecture.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like Obama very much, so I don\u2019t listen to him a lot.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I was in debt, you know who paid it back?\nThey\u2019re just not willing to do it.\u201dThey are angry at President Barack Obama and about the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which most confess they do not fully understand.\nIt\u2019s almost like he\u2019s a dictator,\u201d said Janan Blankowski, 50, a sales associate at the general store."}
