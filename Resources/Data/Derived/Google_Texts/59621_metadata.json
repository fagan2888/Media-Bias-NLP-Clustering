Paul LePage released an executive order on April 16 that spoke about sovereignty in the first sentence, but was quickly overshadowed by the 180-degree turn to suggest the state has dominance over the four federally recognized tribes.\n\nICTMN reached out to the Governor for further clarification on his executive order and he responded by quoting the order or directing questions to Attorney General Janet Mills.\n\nThe attorney general did not respond to the questions, but Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis promptly shared his thoughts on the governor\u2019s remarks.\n\nThe questions and comments revolve around LePage\u2019s April 16 EO, called \u201cAn Order Respecting Joint Sovereignty and Interdependence,\u201d of which ICTMN has obtained a copy. The current document rescinds an August 2011 EO, called \u201cRecognizing the Special Relationship Between the State of Maine and the Sovereign Native American Tribes Located Within the State of Maine.\u201d\n\nThe three year-old EO recognized the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the State of Maine and the Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Aroostook Band of Micmacs, and the Houlton Band of Maliseets. The order also created a consultation policy for tribal input before laws, rules and policies affecting them are passed.\n\nRELATED: Maine Governor Affirms and Rejects Tribal Sovereignty in New Executive Order\n\nRELATED: \u2018Racism Is Central\u2019 to Tribal Conflict with Maine, Says Report\n\nThe new executive order begins with three \u201cwhereas\u201d statements recognizing the Maine\u2019s sovereignty, the tribes\u2019 sovereignty and the relationship between the state and tribes as one \u201cbetween equals, each with its own set of responsibilities.\u201d\n\nThe document then takes a 180-degree turn, asserting the state\u2019s dominance over the tribes \u2013 in effect, denying the sovereignty that is affirmed in the first statements \u2013 and even over tribal lands held in trust by the federal government. \u201cWhereas, all tribe members, Indian nations, and tribes or bands in the State of Maine and any lands or natural resources owned by them or held in trust for them are subject to the laws of the state and to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the State to the same extent as any other persons or lands or natural resources therein.\u201d\n\nThe final \u201cwhereas\u201d statement blames the tribes for failed attempts at collaboration and communication with the state. Efforts by the governor to promote collaboration and communication were \u201dunproductive because the State of Maine\u2019s interests were not respected in the ongoing relationship between sovereigns,\u201d LePage wrote.\n\nICTMN sent the following six questions for clarification. Peter Steele, director of communications responded quickly and then Penobscot Nation Chief Kirk Francis was asked to comment on the governor\u2019s responses.\n\nWhat prompted this executive order?\n\nGovernor\u2019s office: Efforts by the Governor on behalf of the State of Maine to promote collaboration and communication with the tribes have proved unproductive because the State of Maine\u2019s interests have not been respected in the ongoing relationships between the state and the tribes.\n\nChief Francis: I would just say I have no idea what this means. Maine\u2019s interest is one thing, imposing their view based on that interest is quite another. The Stafford Act, Violence Against Women Act, the Tribal Law and Order Act, gaming, fishing, water quality, removal from our river and reservation -- these are all issues and many more that have been blocked in the \u201cinterest of the State.\u201d There has been no respect of the tribal rights within these things. He is simply upset over the increased federal presence on our issues [referring to the federal government\u2019s lawsuit against the state over tribal fishing rights and more recent developments over water quality].\n\nRELATED: Feds Join Penobscot Suit Against State of Maine on Fishing Rights\n\nRELATED: Maine Governor Allegedly Threatens Wabanaki Nations over Elvers\n\nCould you please clarify your position on tribal sovereignty?\n\nGovernor\u2019s office: The Governor\u2019s position has not changed: The Passamaquoddy Tribe, the Penobscot Nation, the Aroostook Band of Micmacs and the Houlton Band of Maliseets are sovereigns in their own right. The relationship between the State of Maine and the individual tribes is a relationship between equals, each with its own set of responsibilities.\n\nChief Francis: \u201cIn our own right \u2026 equals\u201d \u2013 then why does he pretend to have authority over our sovereignty? The mere fact of this EO tells you he thinks it is something he can take away.\n\nWhat rights, in your opinion, do sovereign Indian nations have?\n\nGovernor\u2019s office: Any questions about legal rights of sovereigns must be submitted to the Attorney General\u2019s office.\n\nChief Francis: If he doesn\u2019t know then what\u2019s he talking about when he says \u201csovereign\u201d and \u201cequals\u201d?\n\nCould you please clarify exactly what rights you are saying in your executive order that the state has over tribal lands and waters? For example, the right to regulate hunting and fishing? Water quality standards? Building permits?\n\nGovernor\u2019s office: Any lands or natural resources owned by the tribes or held in trust are subject to the laws of the state and to the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the courts of the state to the same extent as any other person or lands or natural resources. Any other questions about legal rights must be submitted to the Attorney General\u2019s office.\n\nChief Francis: This is simply not factual. The Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act provides for a whole host of internal authority and rights on our lands. The state simply does not want to acknowledge them.\n\nOn what basis \u2013 legal or otherwise \u2013 can the State of Maine claim authority over Indian lands held in trust by the federal government?\n\nGovernor\u2019s office: Again, any legal questions must be submitted to the Attorney General\u2019s office.\n\nChief Francis: They can\u2019t, only to the extent of implementing new acts of Congress within those territories that either preempt state jurisdiction or are not internal tribal matters. There doesn\u2019t leave much that doesn\u2019t qualify as internal within these territories.\n\nWhat do you see as the next step in the relationship between the state and the tribes?\n\nGovernor\u2019s office: The Governor had hoped his 2011 Executive Order would have improved the relationship between the state and the tribes. Since then, the tribes have had difficulty working together, and they have not been cooperative in working with the state. The Governor is still interested in a good relationship with the tribes, but it must be a two-way street.\n\nChief Francis: Again, what the heck is he talking about, specifically? The tribes get along just fine, and if the AG would stop attacking that would be helpful. The tribes have no authority over the state and theirs is illegally assumed. I agree it has to be a two-way street but that relationship will always undoubtedly have disagreement. You cannot just continue to say, \u201cNo,\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s our way,\u201d and expect everyone to be the good subservient Indians. In others words \u201cdo as we say\u201d is their view of productivity. I am also interested in a good relationship with the state \u2013 for tribal people that\u2019s our ultimate hope. I don\u2019t think the state appreciates the stress, emotion and discomfort this relationship has caused and nothing would mean more to us than existing peacefully and productively with the state, but if the starting line for that is their view always rules and our self-governing rights only go as far as that view, this will simply never ever work. As leaders we take oaths and have a responsibility to that oath to protect our people, lands and resources as our ancestors have mandated. Having our Nation governed by others in any other way violates that mandate and responsibility.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an effort to clarify a recent executive order, ICTMN asks Maine Gov.
