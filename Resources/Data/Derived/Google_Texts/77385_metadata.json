In the photo, she wore a \u201cpro life\u201d shirt and held a drink from Chick-fil-A.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nDuring a July 10 Fox & Friends segment, host Anna Kooiman talked of how outraged the left have been over Fisher\u2019s photos. They have compared her to a terrorist and threatened to stone her\u2013actually invited her to submit to stoning in one instance.\n\nFisher responded:\n\nIt\u2019s shocking for me that people would compare somebody that\u2019s standing in front of our flag that represents our freedom\u2013on Independence Day\u2013and I\u2019m holding my First and Second Amendment rights in my hands, and it all represents freedom. They want to compare me to a woman who thinks quite the opposite. She despises everything about this country and hates this country and would kill all of us if given the opportunity.\n\nHost Brian Kilmeade asked her why she posted the photo, and Fisher said she did so because after she posted the Hobby Lobby photo, people said, \u201cThe only thing missing is your gun or your Bible or your flag.\u201d So for the Independence Day picture, she posed with her AR-15 and Bible in front of the U.S. flag.\n\nShe said she expected less backlash from that pose because it represented our country\u2019s founding principles. She was wrong, but that won\u2019t stop her.\n\nShe stated that there is a \u201cgrowing intolerance among the left\u201d that leaves \u201cconservatives afraid to speak up.\u201d Nonetheless, she is going to speak up.\n\nFollow AWR Hawkins Twitter @AWRHawkins.
