Another terrorist declared ISIL\u2019s goal to raise the group\u2019s flag above the White House.\n\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey held a press conference Thursday condemning Foley\u2019s murder and laying out the \u201cimminent threat\u201d this \u201cbarbaric\u201d terror group poses to the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe are pursuing a long-term strategy against ISIL because ISIL clearly poses a long-term threat,\u201d Hagel said. \u201cWe should expect ISIL to regroup and stage new offenses.\u201d\n\nHagel described the ways in which ISIL members \u201cmassacre and enslave innocent people.\u201d\n\nDempsey added the group has an \u201capocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision.\u201d\n\nAfter reading out Obama\u2019s JV quote on an episode of The Lead, CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper asked, \u201cJust how badly did President Obama underestimate the threat of ISIL?\u201d\n\nHagel might have answered that question at his press conference.\n\n\u201cISIL is as sophisticated and well-funded as any group that we have seen,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re beyond just a terrorist group. They marry ideology, a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess. They are tremendously well-funded. Oh, this is beyond anything that we\u2019ve seen. So we must prepare for everything. And the only way you do that is that you take a cold, steely, hard look at it and \u2014 and \u2014 and get ready.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Barack Obama called ISIL a JV team in January.
