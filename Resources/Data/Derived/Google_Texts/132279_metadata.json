That\u2019s the stuff of sociologists, psychologists and behavioral economists.\n\nThe administration suggests that behavioral cues, like comparing your energy use with a neighbor, can be used to increase participation in energy efficiency and other federal goals. The White House created a group last year to experiment with strategies to change behavior. It\u2019s called the Social and Behavioral Sciences Team, and it\u2019s testing methods that might get people to act differently.\n\nOne is a pop-up computer window that urges people to save paper by printing on both sides. The experiment resulted in a 5.8 percent increase in double-sided printing, a potentially significant reduction in the 18 billion pages printed annually by federal workers.\n\nOther efforts failed. An experiment based on research showing that some people will reduce their energy use after seeing that their neighbors use less sought to persuade prescription drug providers to lower their use of addictive opioids. The team sent letters to providers with high-billing patterns showing that their counterparts were distributing lower amounts of the drugs. But the \u201cintervention had no measurable impact,\u201d the White House said in a report released yesterday.\n\nAnother experiment used text messages to remind high school graduates to attend college. \u201cSummer melt\u201d is a phenomenon in which up to 30 percent of urban kids accepted to college don\u2019t show up for school.\n\nThe team also sent \u201cbehaviorally designed letters\u201d to people who might miss the deadline to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cBy improving the effectiveness and efficiency of Government, behavioral science insights can support a range of national priorities,\u201d the executive order says, \u201cincluding helping workers to find better jobs; enabling Americans to lead longer, healthier lives; improving access to educational opportunities and support for success in school; and accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy.\u201d\n\nPeople aren\u2019t \u2018perfectly rational\u2019\n\nSome experts applauded yesterday\u2019s unusual move as a signal that the administration is trying to simplify federal programs. It also marks a move away from economic policies that \u201cnudge\u201d people into a form of behavior preferred by the government, like a gas tax that supposedly could reduce driving by raising the cost.\n\nAndrew Hoffman, a social sciences professor at the University of Michigan, says that people might react rebelliously to a gas tax imposed by the government. A rise in its cost spurred by market forces, on the other hand, might prompt them to drive less.\n\nIn that way, federal policies should consider the complicated ways that people filter, interpret and process messages. You can\u2019t expect to put a price on something\u2014whether that\u2019s gas, plastic bags or emissions\u2014and get an expected result, he said.\n\n\u201cThese are things that sociology, psychology, political science have been focusing on for decades,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cSo to bring in the notion that humans are not perfectly rational, utility-maximizing beings in the formation of policy is long overdue.\u201d\n\nTom Dietz, a professor of sociology and environmental science at Michigan State University, has studied people\u2019s energy consumption for years. In 2011, he published a paper suggesting that carbon labeling could change people\u2019s behavior\u2014and achieve lower emissions as national climate policies are debated.\n\nChanging behavior on flood insurance\n\nThat paper in the journal Nature Climate Change included a label with a black footprint and \u201cCO 2 \u201d in white print. It would provide the amount of greenhouse gases emitted during a product\u2019s \u201cproduction, use and disposal.\u201d\n\nCash for Clunkers is another example of a federal program that was designed with psychology in mind, he said. The program was meant to replace older, less efficient cars with newer ones by offering instant rebates. The benefit to consumers was direct and immediate, he said.\n\nCompare that to tax incentives for energy efficiency retrofits. Dietz ticks off the steps required by the homeowner: Find out if you\u2019re eligible, search for a contractor, fill out federal paperwork, \u201cand months and months later, you see a potential savings on your taxes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if you designed it to fail,\u201d Dietz said. \u201cIt\u2019s so complicated, and the money that comes back is so distant.\u201d\n\nThe executive order, he added, \u201ccould really make life a lot easier.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s announcement yesterday focused on a list of federal efforts that behavioral science could help, including automatic enrollment in retirement savings plans and streamlining the application process for financial aid for college.\n\nThe administration also says climate-related programs could benefit. Behavioral changes being pursued by the Social and Behavioral Sciences Team could result in more people buying federal flood insurance, which suffers from low take-up rates. Public materials will be \u201credesigned to present information more clearly,\u201d the White House said.\n\nThe team is also working on ways to increase energy efficiency in government buildings, in part by providing more access to daylight. And efforts are being designed to increase the use of renewable fuels in the federal fleet of vehicles, as well as encourage greater use of efficient appliances by communicating the benefits with homeowners.\n\nReprinted from Climatewire with permission from Environment & Energy Publishing, LLC. www.eenews.net, 202-628-6500", "article_metadata": {"description": "The social sciences could help combat global warming", "author": "Evan Lehmann,ClimateWire", "og": {"site_name": "Scientific American", "description": "The social sciences could help combat global warming", "title": "Obama Seeks Psychological Help with Climate Change", "url": "http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/obama-seeks-psychological-help-with-climate-change/", "image": "http://www.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/2327C620-3D75-4641-865DB259655EA5E6_agenda.jpg?w=600&h=335", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@sciam", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obama Seeks Psychological Help with Climate Change"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"contentid\": \"5D3FE563-019A-4B80-83DB82DB2035CD5A\"}", "msapplication-TileImage": "/public/resources/favicons/favicon-196-73208969ab1ed3409bc55e8915ed8bae.png", "keywords": "behavioral science, psychology, mind, climate change, environment, global warming,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The team is also working on ways to increase energy efficiency in government buildings, in part by providing more access to daylight.\nIn that way, federal policies should consider the complicated ways that people filter, interpret and process messages.\nPresident Obama is seeking psychological advice about climate change.\nCompare that to tax incentives for energy efficiency retrofits.\nYesterday, he issued an executive order instructing federal agencies to use behavioral science when developing programs to address rising temperatures and other policies."}
