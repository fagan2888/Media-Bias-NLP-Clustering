For example, even Ezra Klein finds himself a mite perturbed by her reversal on this and other matters:\n\nOf late, Clinton is again looking like the kind of candidate who puts polls in front of policy. First, she came out against Obamacare\u2019s Cadillac tax \u2014 a policy that enjoys wide support among health economists\u2026 \u2026What I have trouble believing is that Clinton and her policy advisers really think the Cadillac tax is a bad idea. Her past policies embrace its theory, her past advisers helped pass it into law\u2026 On Wednesday, Clinton came out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, saying that she\u2019s concerned with the provisions around pharmaceuticals and the absence of provisions around currency manipulation. But as Tim Lee notes, Clinton strongly supported early versions of the deal \u2014 she called the TPP \u201cthe gold standard in trade agreements\u201d \u2014 that were worse on pharmaceuticals and identical on currency manipulation\u2026 I don\u2019t truly know what\u2019s in Clinton\u2019s heart \u2014 perhaps I\u2019m wrong, and despite all evidence to the contrary, she holds all these positions deeply \u2014 but as a close reader of her record, I\u2019m not convinced that Clinton, in office, wouldn\u2019t support policies like the Cadillac tax or negotiate trade deals like the TPP. And as someone trying to understand Clinton\u2019s likely governing philosophy, it\u2019s unnerving. And this is a broader problem for Clinton. Her political weakness, fairly or not, is that the voters and the media\u2026have decided that she\u2019s unusually poll-tested and calculating, even for a politician.\n\nApparently, Klein is not enough of a Clinton devotee to be able to say that 2 + 2 = 5 in this case, and he doesn\u2019t even think it would help her if he were to say so, because her flaws have become so obvious. But that doesn\u2019t mean that so many of her supporters are ready to abandon her for this sort of thing. In fact, quite a few of them will probably agree with this chilling yet revealing piece by Matt Yglesias, which is a must-read if you want to understand the heart/mind of the left. Although his starting point is not her TPP reversal but her problems with her email, he explains why none of these flaws may matter to partisan Democrats:\n\nClinton is clearly more comfortable than the average person with violating norms and operating in legal gray areas. This is normally portrayed as a political weakness of hers, and in many ways it is. She can\u2019t credibly portray herself as the kind of outsider who\u2019s going to clean up a broken and corrupt Washington system, because she is very much a part of that system and has been for years. But it\u2019s also an enormous source of potential strength. Committed Democrats and liberal-leaning interest groups are facing a reality in which any policy gains they achieve are going to come through the profligate use of executive authority, and Clinton is almost uniquely suited to deliver the goods. More than almost anyone else around, she knows where the levers of power lie, and she is comfortable pulling them, procedural niceties be damned. Democrats have almost no chance of securing a majority in the US Senate and even worse odds of securing a majority in the House. So if there is a future for making progressive policy, that future is executive action.\n\nSo, there it is. Vote for Hillary! She\u2019ll continue to trash the Constitution just like Obama in order to get what we want, because how else can we be successful in going around the will of the people?\n\nFor their own good, of course.\n\n[NOTE: The title of this post is a reference to the famous Emerson quote about \u201ca foolish consistency\u201d being the \u201chobgoblin of little minds.\u201d]\n\n[Neo-neocon is a writer with degrees in law and family therapy, who blogs at neo-neocon.]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton's inconsistency about TPP and other issues bothers some supporters but not others, who like her because she will use executive action freely.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "Le\u00b7gal In\u00b7sur\u00b7rec\u00b7tion", "description": "Hope and change...and change", "title": "Hillary Clinton and consistency", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/hillary-clinton-president-campaign-2016-ad-admit-email-scandal-benghazi--e1444166561806.png", "updated_time": "2015-10-09T02:36:40+00:00", "url": "http://legalinsurrection.com/2015/10/hillary-clinton-and-consistency/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2015-10-09T08:00:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-09T02:36:40+00:00"}, "keywords": "2016 democratic primary,2016 election,hillary clinton", "google-site-verification": "f_SDILa9XMa3xcLX9n6eq0yDinw8hWKIjXr-0IOcgIE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc96c4\"", "article_summary": "So if there is a future for making progressive policy, that future is executive action.\nFirst, she came out against Obamacare\u2019s Cadillac tax \u2014 a policy that enjoys wide support among health economists\u2026 \u2026What I have trouble believing is that Clinton and her policy advisers really think the Cadillac tax is a bad idea.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that so many of her supporters are ready to abandon her for this sort of thing.\nCommitted Democrats and liberal-leaning interest groups are facing a reality in which any policy gains they achieve are going to come through the profligate use of executive authority, and Clinton is almost uniquely suited to deliver the goods.\nHer political weakness, fairly or not, is that the voters and the media\u2026have decided that she\u2019s unusually poll-tested and calculating, even for a politician."}
