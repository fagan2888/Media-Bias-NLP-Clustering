It's a downward spiral.\u201d\n\nThe new study, which is published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, suggests that these lingering symptoms may be fought off with methods much older \u2014 and arguably more trusted \u2014 than current palliative drugs. To investigate, Kiecolt-Glaser and colleagues enrolled 200 female breast cancer survivors between 27 and 76 years of age in a randomized, controlled clinical trial. The participants, who were all yoga novices, were divided into groups and invited to partake in 90-minute yoga sessions twice a week for three months.\n\nThe team found that, compared to a control group asked to hold off on all things yoga until the end of the trial, the treatment group reported significantly lower levels of fatigue as well as improved sleep and vitality. By measuring inflammatory markers in blood samples, they found that the treatment group also had lower levels of inflammation. \"We were really surprised by the data because some more recent studies on exercise have suggested that exercise interventions may not necessarily lower inflammation unless people are substantially overweight or have metabolic problems,\" Kiecolt-Kaser explained. \"In this group, the women didn't lose weight, but we saw really marked reductions in inflammation. So this was a particularly striking finding biologically.\"\n\nBreast Cancer Rehabilitation\n\nAccording to statistics from the National Institutes of Health, breast cancer is currently the second deadliest cancer among American women, affecting over 200,000 and killing nearly 40,000 each year. It is estimated that one in every eight women will develop the disease at some point in their life. The remains unknown, but risk factors include early puberty, late menopause, and certain genes. Lifestyle factors like calorie intake and alcohol consumption have also been implicated in higher risk for diagnosis.\n\nThe current study is the latest in a series of efforts to alleviate the often debilitating side effects of cancer treatment. Another example is a 2013 study from Sapienza University in Rome, in which researchers unveil a new way to treat breast cancer without surgery. Similarly, a project at the University of Texas\u2019 MD Anderson Proton Therapy Center shows that cancerous tumor growth may be successfully suppressed with subatomic particles.\n\nAlthough several reasons may account for the drop in fatigue and inflammation in the treatment group, Kiecolt-Glaser theorizes that improvements in sleeping patterns may be crucial to the therapy\u2019s success. \"We think improved sleep could be part of the mechanism of what we were seeing. When women were sleeping better, inflammation could have been lowered by that,\" she said. \"Reducing fatigue enables women to engage in other activities over time. So yoga may have offered a variety of benefits in addition to the yoga exercises themselves.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "yoga and breast cancer, breast cancer survivors, yoga and fatigue, yoga and inflammation, breast cancer rehabilitation", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Yoga was shown to slash symptoms like fatigue and inflammation in a trial involving 200 breast cancer survivors.", "title": "Yoga 1 \u2014 Breast Cancer 0", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/yoga-helps-breast-cancer-survivors-sleep-reduce-inflammation-after-taxing-treatment-267995", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/27/yoga.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Yoga was shown to slash symptoms like fatigue and inflammation in a trial involving 200 breast cancer survivors.", "title": "Yoga 1 \u2014 Breast Cancer 0", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/yoga-helps-breast-cancer-survivors-sleep-reduce-inflammation-after-taxing-treatment-267995", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/27/yoga.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/27/yoga.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-01-27T16:00:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-27T16:08:50-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Yoga was shown to slash symptoms like fatigue and inflammation in a trial involving 200 breast cancer survivors."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb988\"", "article_summary": "Breast Cancer RehabilitationAccording to statistics from the National Institutes of Health, breast cancer is currently the second deadliest cancer among American women, affecting over 200,000 and killing nearly 40,000 each year.\n\"This showed that modest yoga practice over a period of several months could have substantial benefits for breast cancer survivors,\" she said.\nTo investigate, Kiecolt-Glaser and colleagues enrolled 200 female breast cancer survivors between 27 and 76 years of age in a randomized, controlled clinical trial.\nBy measuring inflammatory markers in blood samples, they found that the treatment group also had lower levels of inflammation.\nThe current study is the latest in a series of efforts to alleviate the often debilitating side effects of cancer treatment."}
