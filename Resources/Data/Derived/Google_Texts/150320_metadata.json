They examined known subsidies in each of the 50 states and Washington, D.C.\n\nThere are 29 states whose subsidies exceeded one billion dollars.\n\nNine states are responsible for 58 percent of the total $152.9 billion spent on known subsidies of the subsidies.\n\nThis chart shows which corporations are the biggest recipients of state-level corporate welfare. Boeing is the largest recipient, having received $13.3 billion dollars in state funds alone.\n\n\u201cThe chart shows that established corporations, not small businesses or startups, are the overwhelming recipients of state benefits,\u201d wrote de Rugy.\n\nDe Rugy also notes that many of the corporations, such as General Motors, are \u201cdouble-dippers\u201d who also benefit from federal assistance.\n\nAccording to the Mercatus Center:\n\nTargeted state subsidies to private businesses are often promoted as a \u201cmarket-friendly\u201d means to boost growth, jobs, and development. However, the empirical studies on state subsidies find that these programs have little to no effect in producing their intended goals. What\u2019s more\u2026 these subsidies are often ultimately damaging.\n\nThe information was compiled using the Subsidy Tracker 2.0, a dataset collected by Good Jobs First. According to their website, Good Jobs First is \u201ca national policy resource center for grassroots groups and public officials, promoting corporate and government accountability in economic development and smart growth for working families.\u201d The Subsidy Tracker 2.0 is a compilation of data from over 500 state and local sources making it \u201cthe first national search engine for economic development subsidies.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government is not the only source of corporate welfare.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The federal government is not the only source of corporate welfare.", "title": "These 3 Charts Show What Different States Spend on Corporate Welfare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/C2-State-amounts-pie-vero1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-16T16:35:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1sVTzO1"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The federal government is not the only source of corporate welfare.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/C2-State-amounts-pie-vero1.jpg"}, "title": "These 3 Charts Show What Different States Spend on Corporate Welfare", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "government waste", "published_time": "2014-10-16T14:20:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-16T16:35:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Corporate welfare, federal government, state governments"}, "article_summary": "The Mercatus Center has released charts detailing state involvement in corporate welfare.\nThe federal government is not the only source of corporate welfare.\nHowever, the empirical studies on state subsidies find that these programs have little to no effect in producing their intended goals.\nThis chart shows which corporations are the biggest recipients of state-level corporate welfare.\nNine states are responsible for 58 percent of the total $152.9 billion spent on known subsidies of the subsidies."}
