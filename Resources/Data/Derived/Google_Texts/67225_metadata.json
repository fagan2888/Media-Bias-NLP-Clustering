Ted Cruz\u2019s speech Friday at the Palm Beach County Republican Club\u2019s annual Lincoln Day Dinner at the Mar-a-Lago Club. \u201cMany people in our government are trying to hide that from you.\u201d\n\nBecause the dollar is the basis of international markets, the United States can continue to print money to keep running, Carson said.
