And yet, most of what presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders touts on the campaign trail was just boiler-plate Democratic party doctrine not long ago. In this photo, Sanders hands back autographed newspapers during a visit to the National Nurses United office Monday, Aug. 10, 2015, in Oakland, Calif. (Eric Risberg/AP)\n\nThe avowed socialist Bernie Sanders is drawing big crowds in his improbable Democratic presidential bid, alarming party regulars who worry he\u2019ll drag Hillary Clinton off center, making her less attractive in the general election. I\u2019m worried for a different reason: I fear that every policy goal Sanders espouses will be tagged as Marxist dicta from the radical fringe, further marginalizing some perfectly reasonable progressive ideas.\n\nI fear that every policy goal Sanders espouses will be tagged as Marxist dicta from the radical fringe, further marginalizing some perfectly reasonable progressive ideas.\n\nAlready the Republican presidential pack have tried to paint the whole Democratic field with the same scarlet brush. \u201cGive Bernie Sanders credit \u2014 at least he\u2019s honest enough to call himself a socialist,\u201d Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said earlier this month. \u201cHillary Clinton, President Obama \u2014 they\u2019re no better. This shows you how radical the Democratic Party is.\u201d In July, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told CNN, \u201cI\u2019m enjoying watching Hillary Clinton explain to the voters how she is just as much of a socialist as Bernie Sanders.\u201d The Fox News TV show \u201cThe Five\u201d just aired a scary segment on \u201cSanders\u2019 Socialist Agenda\u201d in which panelists pretzeled themselves into issuing dark threats about Sanders\u2019 extremism while saying he is no different than the man American voters elected twice. \u201cYou want a socialist, you want a leftist?\u201d asked co-host Eric Bolling, \u201cYou\u2019ve got one in office right now.\u201d\n\nThe association isn\u2019t helpful. Most Americans, just a generation removed from the Cold War, recoil from the socialist label. A June Gallup poll found voters less likely to vote for a socialist who was \u201cotherwise qualified to be president\u201d than they were any other racial, religious, gender or ideological category. Only 47 percent said they\u2019d be willing to vote for a socialist, while 74 percent said they\u2019d be fine with an otherwise qualified gay or lesbian president, for example. Even the usually reviled atheists fared better (58 percent said they could accept an atheist as president). To call President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act \u201csocialized medicine\u201d is to throw out the basest kind of slur, even worse than calling it \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, most of what Sanders touts on the campaign trail was just boiler-plate Democratic party doctrine not long ago. Indeed, the Sanders phenomenon is a measure of how far the country has drifted to the right over the past few decades. Sure, Sanders has a portrait of Eugene Debs on his office wall, and when he was mayor of Burlington, Vermont, he created a sister-city relationship with Managua, Nicaragua. But let\u2019s take a look at his actual policy proposals:\n\nSanders supports a government-run national health insurance program, an idea first proposed by that notorious Bolshevik, Theodore Roosevelt, in 1912. Fellow traveler Harry Truman followed with his own universal health care proposal in 1945. And of course, Sen. Ted Kennedy was pushing for a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d-type plan until his death in 2009.\n\nSanders wants to raise the top marginal tax rate to more than 50 percent, at least 10 points higher than Obama proposed when he first ran for president in 2007. But the top marginal tax rate was 91 percent when Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, throughout the 1950s. John F. Kennedy slashed that to 65 percent, still 25 points higher than it is today.\n\nSanders wants universal daycare and family leave. In 1971, the U.S. Congress passed the bipartisan Comprehensive Child Development Act, which would have created a national network of federally funded subsidized child care centers. President Nixon vetoed the bill, but not before 24 Senate Republicans voted for \u201csocialized childcare\u201d \u2014 something inconceivable today.\n\nIndeed, the Sanders phenomenon is a measure of how far the country has drifted to the right over the past few decades.\n\nMeanwhile, paid family leave is standard policy at American corporations such as Google, Apple and Netflix, which offer new mothers up to 22 months of paid time off. I guess we\u2019re just a step away from nationalizing the Internet.\n\nFinally, Sanders has called for an end to homelessness, something president George W. Bush also endorsed when he appointed Philip Mangano as his homelessness czar in 2002. Mangano, meanwhile, got his inspiration from St. Francis of Assisi and the U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops, which wrote in 1988 that \u201cShelters cannot substitute for real housing for low-income families.\u201d Who\u2019s a godless communist now?\n\nThe point is that social policies that protect families, care for the needy and fairly share the nation\u2019s wealth are not radical descents into Maoism. They are just rational, humane ideas that politicians of all ideological stripes should be able to embrace. And, once upon a time, they did.\n\nRen\u00e9e Loth covers news, politics and architecture for Cognoscenti.
