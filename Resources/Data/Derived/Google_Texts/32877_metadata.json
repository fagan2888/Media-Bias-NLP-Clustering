Initially hopeful that enrollee targets would be met, Hickey instead found himself staring at a sheet of bad news: only 17 percent of 18 to 34 year olds had signed up in New Mexico in December, about 5 percent lower than compared to other nearby states.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re slow to sign-up here in New Mexico,\u201d Hickey said. \u201cI was not particularly happy with that.\u201d\n\nParticularly worrying for Hickey was that New Mexico had just awarded a contract worth more than $6 million to BVK, a Wisconsin-based PR firm, for a campaign targeting young adults.\n\n\u201cBVK started off sleeping,\u201d Hickey said. \u201cThey missed the December enrollment period. The campaign didn\u2019t grab you. They were just too measured.\u201d\n\nHickey found that unacceptable, because like many of his colleagues across the country, he knows that a key factor for the success of his state\u2019s exchange is dependent on signing up young adults. And with millennial support for the affordable care quickly evaporating, according to a recent Harvard study, Hickey and his peers have a tough job in front of them.\n\nMillennial Marketing Key to Shoring Up Exchanges\n\nGetting younger, healthy adults into the various exchanges has long been considered crucial to the success of the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s a big reason why the Individual Mandate was inserted into the law, as healthy participants in the exchange should help dilute the overall risk for insurers, and hopefully keep premiums lower for everybody.\n\n\u201cThey are a very important demographic in California because they represent a quarter of the state,\u201d said Covered California Information Officer Larry Hicks. \u201cThey balance the insurance pool and that keeps prices low.\u201d\n\nBut the challenge, Hicks added, is that these adults \u201cfeel they are invincible and may not yet be financially stable.\u201d\n\nTo help reach a demographic that may not even want health insurance, let alone be able to reliably pay for it, Covered California has taken the lead on a national marketing campaign focused on where this demo lives: online. Called Tell a Friend, the campaign is utilizing social media, six hour telethon style videos on YouTube, celebrity endorsements and parody videos to reach millennials.\n\n\u201cSo far, in the first two months, 22 percent of our new enrollees have been between the ages of 18 and 34,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cAnd that trend is going up in our December numbers.\u201d\n\nThe website also links to other states\u2019 exchanges, or the federal exchange for states that opted out of offering an insurance marketplace.\n\nOne of the main messages of the Tell a Friend campaign is that young adults are still susceptible to illnesses, accidents and diseases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to pierce that veil of invincibility and tell them this is important to them,\u201d Hicks said.\n\nYet, despite the national reach and high visibility of the campaign, it\u2019s unclear how successful the campaign is in prompting young adults to sign-up for care. While more than 900,000 people have viewed a video spoof of Snoop Dogg\u2019s song Drop It Like It\u2019s Hot that promotes the new exchange, only about half that number in total have actually signed up for coverage in California.\n\n\u201cWe think the message is getting through,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cThe enrollment ends March 31st, and we are finding success in this campaign.\u201d\n\nEase the Sense of Risk\n\nSocial media and high-profile spokespeople may help reach the target audience, but Warren Schirtzinger thinks the message can be better tailored to motivate millennials.\n\nSchirtzinger is the managing director of High-Tech Strategies, a Seattle-based firm specializing in emerging technologies. He said that while millennials may be perceived as being \u201cplugged-in but tuned-out\u201d to the health-care message, they have similar concerns to their older counterparts.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to wonder if this is going to work,\u201d Schirtzinger said. \u201cThere\u2019s a definite sense of risk. \u2018Did I get the right doctor, did I pick the right plan, is this program going to be around?\u2019 A celebrity or catchy hashtag doesn\u2019t ease a risk averse point of view.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think you can make health care sexy,\u201d Schirtzinger added.\n\nThe good news for government is that it is in a unique position to alleviate concerns about risk.\n\n\u201cThere are certain things that governments and big organizations can do that others can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the state can somehow guarantee the exchange or the plan. \u2026 If they can back the campaign with the trust worthiness of the state, that can help lower the perceived risk for everything.\u201d\n\nThat message of trust might seem like a tough sell after the disastrous rollout of the federal health exchange website, but Schirtzinger said millennials are more likely to forgive that tech-train wreck.\n\n\u201cMillennials are used to technology; they grew up with it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know there\u2019s no such thing as a flawless rollout.\u201d\n\nAnd while several recent polls show millennials have a strong distrust of power, politicians and their parties, they overwhelmingly see government as a potential instrument for positive change. Schirtzinger believes the opportunity is there to get millennials motivated to join the program.\n\n\u201cYou always see a sequence of people to buy-in to any type of program or big idea [and then the rest follow],\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a spectrum of acceptance. Millennials are no different.\u201d\n\nStaying on the Horse\n\nNationwide, there\u2019s a lag in young adult enrollees. While they make up about 40 percent of the eligible population, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), only about 25 percent have enrolled.\n\n\u201cWe expect that percentage to increase,\u201d CMS\u2019 Gary Cohen said on a recent call with reporters. \u201cMany of them \u2026 want to shop around, they haven\u2019t been insured before.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration has also reported a surge in new young adult enrollees nationwide as the website has improved and word of mouth has spread about discounts and subsidies offered to young people.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, less than 50,000 had enrolled in November, while more than 250,000 had enrolled by the end of December.\n\nIn New Mexico, Hickey is hopeful the next three months will be better than the last two.\n\nAfter the slow marketing start, Hickey said the company, BVK, has come back with a revamped campaign that includes TV, radio and billboard spots. The campaign, Hickey said, will focus in part on that risk aversion and explain why new enrollees will be able to trust the exchange.\n\n\u201cThings take time and move slowly,\u201d Hickey said. \u201cWe have to figure out how to sell this idea that single, healthy, young people should get covered. We have to explain that this is peace of mind, that the tradeoffs of cost are worth it.\u201d\n\nWhatever changes or tweaks states make to their health exchange marketing plans, the good news is there will only be more public awareness as the March 31 enrollment deadline approaches.\n\nHickey believes that approaching deadline will help motivate many millennials to get covered.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not central to their social life, they procrastinate,\u201d Hickey said.", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "GT Article", "description": "States looking to market health exchanges to young adults turn to online campaigns.", "pubDate": "2014-01-20", "og": {"image": "http://media2.govtech.com/images/AP_Peter+Lee_Covered+CA.jpg", "title": "Marketing Healthcare.gov to the Online Generation"}, "wssUrl": "http://www.govtech.com/health", "p": {"domain_verify": "6fde23837116ec868cad5f966cf08656"}, "wss": "Health and Human Services", "authors": "[]", "google-site-verification": "YGeeEDFGk0P1HO8tlyROBmRbQvw1H3jzQqXhn0Q55a8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc31\"", "article_summary": "A board member of New Mexico\u2019s health exchange, Hickey was at his desk, combing through December\u2019s new enrollee numbers.\nThe campaign, Hickey said, will focus in part on that risk aversion and explain why new enrollees will be able to trust the exchange.\nAfter the slow marketing start, Hickey said the company, BVK, has come back with a revamped campaign that includes TV, radio and billboard spots.\nMillennial Marketing Key to Shoring Up ExchangesGetting younger, healthy adults into the various exchanges has long been considered crucial to the success of the Affordable Care Act.\nOne of the main messages of the Tell a Friend campaign is that young adults are still susceptible to illnesses, accidents and diseases."}
