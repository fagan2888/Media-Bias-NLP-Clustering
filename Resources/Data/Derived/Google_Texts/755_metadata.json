Despite those numbers, Cutler has come under criticism for his continued failures in the passing game, and his penchant for turning the ball over has drawn scrutiny from many corners.\n\nTrestman did decline to comment on reports by Rapoport that the team plans to relieve Mel Tucker of his duties as defensive coordinator in the offseason, saying instead that the team is focusing its efforts on beating the Saints next week at Soldier Field.\n\nHampton: Other Teams Are Mastering Fundamentals Hall of Famer Dan Hampton says the Chicago Bears have put too much trust into Jay Cutler and have forgotten how to play basic football.
