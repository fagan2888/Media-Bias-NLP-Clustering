The Affordable Care Act has provided insurance to millions of poor and near-poor in recent years, but an unanticipated coverage gap has emerged for the middle and upper-middle classes.  When people who once had good jobs with good health plans lose both, they suddenly are seen as too affluent to qualify for assistance yet in reality are too strapped to afford the policies available in the individual market.  Most other countries don\u2019t do this, says Jessica Roberts, director of the Health Law & Policy Institute at University of Houston\u2019s Law Center.

When the ACA passed in 2010, the assumption was that those without employer plans could turn to the health care exchange for affordable coverage.  [...] in the years since the law passed, coverage has narrowed, deductibles have risen and insurers have demanded double-digit rate increases in the individual market to counteract losses they say blindsided them.
