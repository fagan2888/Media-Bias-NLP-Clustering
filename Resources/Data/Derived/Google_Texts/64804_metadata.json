I had a Covered California plan for eight months last year before I moved to Texas. But I still haven\u2019t received a 1095-A form from Covered California. What should I do?\n\nA. When Travis Choma, 35, moved from California to Dallas in August, he arranged to cancel his Covered California health plan and buy a new plan from the federal health insurance exchange, healthcare.gov.\n\nEverything went smoothly on the federal side. Less so here. Among the complications is Choma\u2019s missing 1095-A tax form from Covered California, which lists the amount of tax credits he received in 2014. (By comparison, he received his 1095-A from healthcare.gov in early January.)\n\n\u201cThis is so frustrating,\u201d says Choma, an independent software developer who has spent countless hours trying to fix the problem. \u201cI\u2019m a person who takes my paperwork seriously and gets it correct.\u201d\n\nYou need these forms for your taxes. But Covered California hasn\u2019t made it easy. The agency told me previously that it sent out about 100,000 forms containing inaccurate information, and it promised to send out revised ones by late-February.\n\nBut about 10,000 tax filers of the 100,000 didn\u2019t receive 1095-A forms at all, says Covered California\u2019s Dana Howard.\n\nCovered California had conflicting information for those tax filers, such as two different addresses, Howard says. \u201cThere were multiple sets of information for the same person,\u201d he says.\n\nThe agency has been working to fix inconsistencies and distribute the forms, he says.\n\nIf you still don\u2019t have your tax form, or have received one with inaccurate information, file a 1095-A dispute form with Covered California as soon as possible. (Find the form at CoveredCA.com.)\n\nCovered California has 60 days to respond, which may push you beyond the April 15 tax filing deadline.\n\nIf that happens, you have options, such as requesting an extension to file your taxes, says Alison Flores of the Tax Institute at H&R Block. That might not be the best plan for your situation, so the most useful advice I have, which I\u2019ve given to you before, is to consult a tax professional.\n\nQ. Is it true that Covered California is still letting people enroll if they want to avoid a tax penalty next year?\n\nA. Let\u2019s deal with 2014 first. If you didn\u2019t have health insurance for all or part of last year, you already owe an Obamacare tax penalty for 2014 (unless you qualify for one of the law\u2019s many exemptions).\n\nNow for 2015. If you still don\u2019t have insurance this year, Covered California is giving you a second chance. It announced a special enrollment period \u2013 which lasts until April 30 \u2013 for people who didn\u2019t realize there was a tax penalty for not having health coverage.\n\nBut even with the extra time to enroll, you\u2019re probably not going to get off scot-free when you file your 2015 tax return next year.\n\nObamacare\u2019s tax penalty is prorated, which means you will owe one-twelfth of the annual penalty for each month you or your dependents don\u2019t have coverage or an exemption from having it, Flores says.\n\nIf, say, you sign up for health insurance on April 25, your health plan won\u2019t start until June 1. That means you\u2019ll be uninsured for five months in 2015 and owe five months of penalty, Howard says.\n\nThat\u2019s still better than a full year\u2019s worth, he says.\n\nSpeaking of the tax penalty, I\u2019m also hearing that some people are being incorrectly penalized for 2014. For instance, unauthorized immigrants and those in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration program are exempt from the penalty because they are excluded from health insurance exchanges and receiving tax credits.\n\nThe National Immigration Law Center is receiving complaints that tax professionals are giving some of their clients in these categories bad information.\n\n\u201cSo many of them are low-income individuals who can\u2019t afford to pay this penalty anyway,\u201d says Gabrielle Lessard, the group\u2019s health policy attorney.\n\nI still believe you should seek tax help. But you might want to ensure your preparer has been schooled in Obamacare\u2019s new tax rules.\n\nQ. You keep telling us to get tax help, but I can\u2019t afford a preparer. Do I have any options?\n\nA. There are many free tax preparation services available, including the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program, run by the IRS. VITA is available at libraries, schools, shopping centers and other sites around the country. Go to irs.gov/VITA or call 800-906-9887 to learn more.\n\nThe AARP Foundation Tax-Aide program also provides free assistance, and its volunteer preparers are trained in Obamacare\u2019s particulars. Go to aarp.org/findtaxhelp or call 888-227-7669 for more information.\n\nPlease note that some of these programs are limited by age, income or other factors.\n\nFinally, I\u2019ll end with a correction: In my previous column about Covered California\u2019s small-business exchange, called SHOP, I incorrectly said it offers the same plans available to individuals and families. Instead, it offers fewer insurance carriers with somewhat different options.
