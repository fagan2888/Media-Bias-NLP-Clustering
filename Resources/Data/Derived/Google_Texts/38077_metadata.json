While being mindful of this vital role we play in the lives of the most vulnerable, the Affordable Care Act and health care trends have us transitioning from being primarily a safety net provider to a \u2018provider of first choice,\u2019 which more accurately reflects the quality of care we provide for everyone in our community,\u201d he said.\n\nHe explained his enthusiasm for rethinking how health care is provided, bringing medical and behavioral health together in a way that better addresses patient needs while reducing the stigma of behavioral health.\n\nThe World Health Organization reports that upwards of 70 percent of all visits to primary care (medical) clinics are directly linked to psycho-social drivers. That means that the stressors of life often manifest as physical symptoms.\n\nFernandez says, \u201cBehavioral health is a term that has a very broad definition; it describes how we care for ourselves and one another\u2014our relationships, hopes, loves, challenges and pain, our choices and the results of those choices. The work addresses our humanness in context.\u201d\n\nFederally qualified health centers like MCHC Health Centers are moving toward value-based care, which will reimburse treatment based on quality measures and outcomes instead of the number of patient visits.\n\n\u201cValue-based care will give us increased flexibility and allow for more creativity in the design of care plans and treatment modalities\u2014this means the ability to tailor a plan unique to the individual, encouraging people to engage more in their own health care with an even greater focus on what matters most to them. When any of us focus on what matters most to us, we are more successful,\u201d he said.\n\nMCHC Health Centers has several initiatives currently in progress, including obtaining Patient-Centered Medical Home recognition for all of its sites; further developing its Integrated Care teams; and implementing the integrated behavioral health grant.\n\n\u201cThe IBH grant supports screening for and treatment of depression, giving the attention this painful and all-too-common condition deserves,\u201d Fernandez said.\n\nMCHC Health Centers will also be expanding its services to those who struggle with substance abuse. \u201cTo achieve these goals it is important that we not only work more collaboratively internally linking medical and behavioral health, but also to become more closely tied to our community partners,\u201d Fernandez explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe continued, \u201cLuckily, I am one of many. Everyone at MCHC plays an important role in delivering care to our patients and giving respect to and treating one another with kindness. It is an honor to be a part of our patients\u2019 lives and the lives of our amazing staff. I am really grateful for the opportunity to serve in this new role.\n\nMCHC Health Centers provides comprehensive health services, including primary medical care, pediatrics, dentistry, women\u2019s health, obstetrical care, counseling, psychiatry, chiropractic and specialty care, and looks forward to growing to meet the ever-expanding needs of the communities it serves.
