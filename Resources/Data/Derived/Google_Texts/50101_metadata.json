Marco Rubio (R-FL) speaks at CPAC in 2015.\n\nPotential 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) inexplicably told a conservative audience on Friday that President Barack Obama lacked a military strategy to confront ISIS because he feared upsetting Iran, a country that has actually committed itself to defeating the terrorist group.\n\nSpeaking before the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland, Rubio told radio and TV host Sean Hannity that \u201cif we wanted to defeat them militarily, we could do it. [Obama] doesn\u2019t want to upset Iran.\u201d\n\nReferring to the United States\u2019 ongoing negotiations with Iran to contain that country\u2019s nuclear program, Rubio continued, \u201cIn [Obama\u2019s] mind, this deal with Iran is going to be the Obamacare of the second term, and he doesn\u2019t want them sending military to the region because they think the region belongs to them.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem: Iran has been fighting ISIS just like the United States and has publicly urged America to take a larger role in the operation. Obama has even sent a letter to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suggesting anti-ISIS cooperation.\n\nAs the Obama administration and its global partners have \u201cdropped more than 8,200 bombs and missiles on ISIS targets in 2,500 air strikes\u201d in Syria and Iraq and are now preparing to train moderate Syrian forces and the Iraqi army to take on the combatants, Iran, which sees Iraq as a strategic buffer against Sunni Arab states, has worked to ensure that Iraq does not pose a military threat to its influence in the region.\n\nTehran has launched military strikes against ISIS militants. It has tried to prop-up the Iraqi government, sent General Qassem Suleimani, commander of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, to coordinate the defense of Baghdad and has worked with the country\u2019s Shiite militias to stop the militants\u2019 advance. Last month, more than 2,000 Iranian troops traveled to Iraq to tackle the insurgency and publicly Iranian officials urged the world to fight.\n\n\u201cThe expansion of terrorist elements of [ISIS] and their violent acts in Iraq was a warning for the region,\u201d Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, said in June. \u201cThere is a need for attention and action from governments and the international community.\u201d\n\nIn the Senate, Rubio is a member of the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Select Committee on Intelligence.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Rubio says Obama doesn't want to fight ISIS because that would upset Iran.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Rubio says Obama doesn't want to fight ISIS because that would upset Iran.", "title": "Marco Rubio Tries To Lecture Obama On ISIS, Commits Epic Error", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/world/2015/02/27/3627902/marco-rubio-tries-criticize-obama-isis-commits-epic-fail/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Marco-Rubio-CPAC.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rubio says Obama doesn't want to fight ISIS because that would upset Iran.", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Marco-Rubio-CPAC-321x214.jpg", "title": "Marco Rubio Tries To Lecture Obama On ISIS, Commits Epic Error", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-world", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Marco-Rubio-CPAC.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Marco-Rubio-CPAC.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-27T09:54:29+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbee7\"", "article_summary": "World Marco Rubio Tries To Lecture Obama On ISIS, Commits Epic Error CREDIT: AP Sen.
