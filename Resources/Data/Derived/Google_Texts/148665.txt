SOUTHAMPTON, England, Nov. 10 (UPI) -- Coronavirus dies quickly when exposed to copper, unlike other surface materials such as glass, tile and stainless steel where it can survive for days, researchers at the University of Southampton found in a new study.

Limiting the spread of respiratory viruses such as human coronavirus, or those that spread from animals such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, is difficult because of how infectious they are, researchers said. Cutting the time viruses can survive on surfaces would help.

The same researchers in the new study have shown in previous studies that copper can kill norovirus, influenza and MRSA, making the use of copper alloy in hospital and medical labs seem like a good idea.

"Transmission of infectious diseases via contaminated surfaces is far more important than was originally thought, and this includes viruses that cause respiratory infections," Dr. Sarah Warnes, a Southampton researcher, said in a press release. "This is especially important when the infectious dose is low and just a few virus particles can initiate an infection."

Warnes and Professor Bill Keevil, chairman of Environmental Healthcare at the university, tested human coronavirus 229E, which is similar to SARS and MERS, on several surfaces. On most surfaces -- including ceramic, tile, glass, rubber and stainless steel -- 229E survived for at least five days, however was rapidly destroyed irreversibly on copper surfaces.

"The rapid inactivation and irreversible destruction of the virus observed on copper and copper alloy surfaces suggests that the incorporation of copper alloy surfaces -- in conjunction with effective cleaning regimes and good clinical practice -- could help control transmission of these viruses," Keevil said.

The study is published in mBio.
