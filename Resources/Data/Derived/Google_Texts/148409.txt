Plans are divided into four different types – Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum – varying based on the size of their deductibles, copayments and other consumer costs. The Bronze plan pays for 60 percent of medical costs; the Platinum, 90 percent. Premiums are highest and deductibles the lowest for Platinum plans. Bronze plans generally have deductibles in the thousands of dollars; $5,000 and $10,000 deductibles. Within each tier, the amount you pay for deductibles, copayments and coinsurance may vary from company to company and even from plan to plan within companies.

No matter which plan you choose, the 10 essential benefits remain the same. There is also the option to purchase catastrophic insurance — low cost plans that cover minimal services but provide a safety net in the event of an accident or serious illness. But those plans do not come with subsidies.





People up to age 30 will have the option of buying a catastrophic plan that will cover only minimal services until they meet a deductible of roughly $6,400. The premium is usually much lower than the other plans. After the deductible is met, the plan covers the 10 essential health benefits — a kind of “safety net” coverage in case you have an accident or serious illness, according to the HealthCare.gov website. Catastrophic plans usually do not provide coverage for services like prescription drugs or shots. And there are other limits.
