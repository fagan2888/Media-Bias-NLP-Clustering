Therefore it is not possible to establish the precise number of persons who have illegally crossed two sections of the external borders of the EU.\u201d\n\nThe report also warned that a \u201cstaggering number\u201d of EU citizens have travelled to Syria to fight with ISIS and that they are now posing as refugees to gain entry to Europe.\n\nIt is always tough to hear about reports like this and then see the Michelle Obama host a grand celebration of Nowruz, the Iranian New Year.\n\n\"We think America is strongest when we recognize our many traditions, when we celebrate our diversity and we lift each other up. And in times like these when we think of all that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s most important than ever before right now today with what\u2019s going on. Right now when we are hearing so much disturbing and hateful rhetoric, it is so important to remember that our diversity has been and will always be our greatest source of strength and pride here in the United States. We are a nation of immigrants and we should cherish the talent and energy and the beautiful traditions and cultures that come with that heritage,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Terrorists are using the migration crisis to enter Europe and plot destruction across the continent says the European Unions own border agency.  .05/27/2016 8:10:03AM EST.", "author": "Justin Holcomb", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Terrorists are using the migration crisis to enter Europe and plot destruction across the continent says the European Unions own border agency.", "title": "Justin Holcomb  - EU Border Agents Say Terrorists Entering Europe May be Undetectable", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/justinholcomb/2016/04/07/draft-n2144741", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/96/5a94e86d-fa54-4940-aa63-f98852be69a3.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Terrorists are using the migration crisis to enter Europe and plot destruction across the continent says the European Unions own border agency.", "title": "Justin Holcomb  - EU Border Agents Say Terrorists Entering Europe May be Undetectable", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/justinholcomb/2016/04/07/draft-n2144741", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/96/5a94e86d-fa54-4940-aa63-f98852be69a3.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "EU Border Agents Say Terrorists Entering Europe May be Undetectable, Justin Holcomb , Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Terrorists are using the migration crisis to enter Europe and plot destruction across the continent says the European Union\u2019s own border agency.\nAnd in times like these when we think of all that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s most important than ever before right now today with what\u2019s going on.\nA report from Frontex claims that a record 1.82 million illegal border crossings last year, six times higher than the previous record set in 2014.\nThe report claims:\u201cThere is no EU system capable of tracing people\u2019s movements following an illegal border-crossing.\n\"We think America is strongest when we recognize our many traditions, when we celebrate our diversity and we lift each other up."}
