If they\u2019re successful, their proposed initiated statute would be placed before the general assembly, with lawmakers given about four months to act.\n\nThe initiated statute has a one-sentence summary, calling for the expansion of Ohio\u2019s Medicaid program \u201cto the fullest extent permitted by the [federal] Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nLawmakers could pass it as-is, adopt a different version or ignore the issue outright. In the case of the latter two, the petitioners could gather another 115,000-plus signatures to place the proposed law before voters in November 2014.\n\nMatt Koppitch, legislative liaison for the Service Employees International Union, District 1199, who spoke on behalf of the campaign, called the effort \u201cPlan B,\u201d with hopes that lawmakers will act before the end of the year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still going to be engaging the legislature as well,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring the Sept. 19 Ballot Board meeting, Sen. Bill Coley, a Republican from southwestern Ohio, questioned whether the petition summary fairly represented the issues involved and whether the proposed law change would be in conflict with other sections of Ohio Revised Code.\n\nBut in the end, the Ballot Board vote to certify was unanimous.\n\nMarc Kovac is the Dix Capital Bureau Chief.
