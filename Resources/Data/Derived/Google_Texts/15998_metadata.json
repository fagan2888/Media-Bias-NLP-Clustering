Kasich\u2019s endorsement extends only to Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion. The law\u2019s private-sector coverage provision, Kasich has clarified, should be repealed and replaced. That's been his position for a long time. \u201cI have favored expanding Medicaid,\" he told Politico, \"but I don\u2019t really see expanding Medicaid as really connected to Obamacare.\"\n\nLiberals are predictably reveling in Kasich\u2019s contradiction\u2014the Medicaid expansion was a huge piece of the Affordable Care Act's overall coverage scheme\u2014and in the contortions he\u2019s had to undergo to assure conservatives that his Obamacare apostasy extends only so far. But I don\u2019t actually see much of a contradiction here. And more to the point, millions of poor Americans would be much better off if more Republicans adopted Kasich\u2019s position that states should adopt the ACA's Medicaid expansion while tilting at windmills to topple its private sector program.\n\nUnlike other GOP repeal plans, abolishing the ACA\u2019s insurance exchanges, regulations, and subsidies while keeping the Medicaid expansion is a perfectly workable\u2014though foolhardy\u2014policy proposal. Contrast Kasich with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who supports repealing Obamacare entirely and dissembles to voters that the Kentucky state government will somehow preserve the Medicaid expansion on its own, without the vast federal transfers that made it possible.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "If only all Republicans were like the Ohio governor", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Embrace it!", "title": "Liberals, don't mock Republicans who come to see the errors of their ways", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/e9779b0537359fbcbe7548effa8f7886601e6595.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/119921/john-kasich-supports-medicaid-expansion-if-only-all-gop-govs-did", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Embrace it!", "title": "Liberals, don't mock Republicans who come to see the errors of their ways", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/e9779b0537359fbcbe7548effa8f7886601e6595.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/e9779b0537359fbcbe7548effa8f7886601e6595.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Liberals Shouldn't Mock John Kasich's Obamacare Contradiction.
