But after a judge rejected that lawsuit last week, the group has been forced to reassess its strategy against the Alabama Women\u2019s Center, which is located in Hunstville.\n\nNow, the group\u2019s executive director, James Henderson, has indicated that he will start pressuring lawmakers to support a measure that would require abortion clinics to be at least 2,000 feet away from schools \u2014 the same buffer zone that the state maintains between convicted sexual predators and schools. Since the Alabama\u2019s Women\u2019s Center is located across the street from a site that\u2019s being remodeled to be a magnet school, that would require its owners to relocate.\n\nHenderson, who was recently elected to the executive committee of the state\u2019s Republican Party, is confident that a buffer zone measure could advance in the legislature. \u201cWe are more motivated than ever to press on in standing for the unborn and their mothers,\u201d he told the Hunstville Times. \u201cThere will be a lot of public input and I know it\u2019s something Republican legislators will support.\u201d\n\nDalton Johnson, who owns the Alabama Women\u2019s Center, has already been forced to relocate his business this year. In June, Johnson closed his clinic because he couldn\u2019t comply with a harsh new state law that requires clinics to meet strict building requirements. Under the new law, which stipulates that abortion clinics need to qualify as ambulatory surgical centers, Johnson\u2019s building didn\u2019t have wide enough hallways. Four months later, he was finally able to re-open in his current location.\n\nJohnson called Henderson\u2019s proposed buffer zone \u201ccrazy,\u201d pointing out that abortion clinics are not inherently disruptive.\n\n\u201cIt just goes to how they don\u2019t want safe access here in Alabama. Nobody would know this is an abortion clinic if the protesters weren\u2019t out there,\u201d he told the Hunstville Times. The Christian Coalition of Alabama has been protesting outside of his clinic for the past decade. \u201cIf he would go on home and stop protesting then it would not be an issue.\u201d\n\nHenderson\u2019s line of argument isn\u2019t entirely unusual. Abortion opponents frequently suggest that reproductive health clinics aren\u2019t appropriate businesses for quiet, wholesome communities. Earlier this month, a mayor in Georgia banned abortion clinics from his town altogether in order to avoid \u201cdrama.\u201d (That ordinance is probably not legal, and lawmakers in the town are now reconsidering.) Anti-choice activists extend this logic to the people who work at clinics, too, suggesting they shouldn\u2019t be allowed to volunteer at public schools.\n\nBut equating legal reproductive health services with immoral or unsavory activity \u2014 and implying that abortion is in the same category as child molestation \u2014 has serious consequences. This attitude toward the medical procedure helps fuel the persistent abortion stigma that teaches Americans abortion is something to be ashamed about. It sends a message to the one in three U.S. women who have chosen to end a pregnancy that they shouldn\u2019t ever admit to making that decision.\n\nThe ongoing war against Johnson\u2019s clinic is just one example of the way that reproductive rights are under attack in Alabama. Women in the state are also required to undergo a 48-hour waiting period, a mandatory ultrasound, and biased counseling before they\u2019re allowed to proceed with an abortion. Alabama also has one of the most radical parental consent laws in the country, allowing the state to appoint a lawyer for minors\u2019 fetuses and call witnesses to testify about why teenagers shouldn\u2019t be allowed to end their pregnancies.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Anti-choice activists want lawmakers to enact an ordinance requiring abortion clinics to maintain the same distance from schools as sex offenders do.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Anti-choice activists want lawmakers to enact an ordinance requiring abortion clinics to maintain the same distance from schools as sex offenders do.", "title": "Anti-Choice Activists In Alabama Equate Abortion Clinics With Sex Offenders", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/11/24/3596266/alabama-abortion-clinic-sex-offenders/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/24164850/AP400071956392-1024x681-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Anti-choice activists want lawmakers to enact an ordinance requiring abortion clinics to maintain the same distance from schools as sex offenders do.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/24164850/AP400071956392-1024x681-321x214.jpg", "title": "Anti-Choice Activists In Alabama Equate Abortion Clinics With Sex Offenders", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/24164850/AP400071956392-1024x681-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/24164850/AP400071956392-1024x681-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-24T11:48:50+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3f37\"", "article_summary": "Health Anti-Choice Activists In Alabama Equate Abortion Clinics With Sex Offenders CREDIT: AP PHOTO/BRYNN ANDERSON The only abortion clinic in Montgomery, AlabamaA right-wing group in Alabama is hoping to put an abortion clinic out of business by encouraging lawmakers to enact a new ordinance that requires abortion clinics to maintain the same distance from schools as sex offenders do.\nUnder the new law, which stipulates that abortion clinics need to qualify as ambulatory surgical centers, Johnson\u2019s building didn\u2019t have wide enough hallways.\nNobody would know this is an abortion clinic if the protesters weren\u2019t out there,\u201d he told the Hunstville Times.\nJohnson called Henderson\u2019s proposed buffer zone \u201ccrazy,\u201d pointing out that abortion clinics are not inherently disruptive.\nBut after a judge rejected that lawsuit last week, the group has been forced to reassess its strategy against the Alabama Women\u2019s Center, which is located in Hunstville."}
