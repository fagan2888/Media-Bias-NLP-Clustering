Better treatment here, and everything is going to go a lot faster.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets surely hope it\u2019s a faster process than what he endured playing for the Guangdong Southern Tigers last season in China. He suffered an ankle injury last December that kept him out of action until February. He played just 10 games before returning to play in two playoff games.\n\nNuggets coach Michael Malone mentioned that Mudiay tweaked his ankle during a practice session recently, but Mudiay said that didn\u2019t have anything to do with what happened against the Timberwolves.\n\n\u201cIt just happened on the court,\u201d Mudiay said. \u201cI jammed it a little bit. It wasn\u2019t really a roll. I didn\u2019t feel it roll. I just felt it jam. So that was really it.\u201d\n\nMudiay has started all 23 games of his first season with the Nuggets and averages 10.7 points and 5.7 assists per game. Veteran Jameer Nelson is expected to get the start against the Rockets, whom the Nuggets are facing for the third and final time this season.\n\nNelson had one of his best games of the season in Friday\u2019s victory against the Timberwolves, scoring a season-high 20 points on 7-of-12 shooting in a season-high 38 minutes. Nelson made four 3-pointers in the third quarter alone on his way to his first 20-point game since he scored 22 last March 28 against Portland.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never concerned about missing or making shots,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just me being aggressive. That\u2019s the ultimate goal for myself, to be aggressive and pick and choose my spots when to shoot and know what the team needs.\u201d\n\nMalone praised Nelson\u2019s overall play this season, saying \u201cJameer\u2019s a pro, a guy that\u2019s played in many, many big games, and I trust him.\u201d\n\nAsked how he thought his season was going, Nelson remained matter-of-fact.\n\n\u201cIt goes up and down a little bit,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cAs the backup point, you come in and be who you are, but you also have to see what the team needs at that time. You want to play all of the minutes, but everybody has a role; everybody has a job to do. I just try to do my job to the best of my ability.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nHOUSTON AT DENVER 7 p.m. Monday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Clint Capela:\n\nIf you made a list of relative unknowns who make big impacts on their respective teams, Capela would be on it. The second-year center out of Switzerland gives the Rockets toughness in the post, rebounding and rim protection with averages of 8.2 points, 6.8 rebounds and 1.2 blocks per game.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nNuggets:\n\nForward Darrell Arthur did not practice on Sunday due to soreness in his right knee, but he remains questionable for Monday\u2019s game against the Rockets. He did not play in the team\u2019s last game against Minnesota. \u2026 The Nuggets have already won the season series against the Rockets, up 2-0, going into the final matchup today.\n\nRockets:\n\nMontrezl Harrell, the rookie out of Louisville has been assigned to the D-League. Forward Sam Dekker will not play against the Nuggets due to lower back pain. \u2026 Former Nuggets guard Ty Lawson has fallen out of the starting lineup in Houston, and in his last five games has struggled with averages of 3.4 points and 4.0 assists. He\u2019s shot 27.8 percent from the field in that span.\n\nChristopher Dempsey, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets\u2019 rookie Emmanuel Mudiay to miss first game as pro", "title": "Nuggets\u2019 rookie Emmanuel Mudiay to miss first game as pro", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/13/nuggets-rookie-emmanuel-mudiay-to-miss-first-game-as-pro/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151120__498086342p1-4.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151120__498086342p1-4.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-13T20:14:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T21:36:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Mudiay described the injury as \u201ckind of what happened in China, but not as bad as what happened in China.\nEmmanuel Mudiay left the Pepsi Center on Sunday in a walking boot and with the knowledge that, on Monday, he would miss his first game as a professional.\n\u2026 The Nuggets have already won the season series against the Rockets, up 2-0, going into the final matchup today.\nSo that was really it.\u201dMudiay has started all 23 games of his first season with the Nuggets and averages 10.7 points and 5.7 assists per game.\nNuggets coach Michael Malone mentioned that Mudiay tweaked his ankle during a practice session recently, but Mudiay said that didn\u2019t have anything to do with what happened against the Timberwolves."}
