But we think there is a chance to do the former.\u201d\n\nTo do that, Illinois must first answer five questions:\n\nHow many people have signed up for Obamacare?\n\nIt will take a few days \u2014 or weeks \u2014 to tally the final Obamcare numbers, according to Mike Claffey, Illinois\u2019 health care spokesman.\n\n\u201cSince the February numbers were released around March 11, we expect March numbers around the same time,\u201d Claffey explained.\n\nAt the end of February, he said, 113,000 people had picked a plan through the state\u2019s marketplace, Get Covered Illinois. Some probably went to the federal website, Healthcare.gov.\n\nHow many of those people have paid for Obamacare?\n\nIf 113,000 people chose a plan, as many as 22,600 haven\u2019t paid for it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole host of folks who haven\u2019t paid their premiums, possibly as much as 20 percent or more,\u201d Domenech said. \u201cWhich means the (sign up) figure is going to be a heck of a lot lower.\u201d\n\nPeople may stop paying premiums later in the year. Obamacare essentially gives people three months for free, and critics expect thousands to take advantage of that loophole.\n\nHow many young people have bought insurance under Obamacare?\n\nIllinois has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars for funny lists on Buzzfeed and the Onion was to get young people into Obamacare.\n\nMillennials are key to the program; they essentially are needed to pay premiums so Obamcare can pay for coverage for the older and sicker people who have jumped into the program.\n\n\u201cThe thing that I think is interesting is that 3 million people who got coverage under the law are the young adults who signed up under their parents\u2019 insurance plans,\u201d Domenech said. The so-called slacker tax is one of the only true head counts for young people under Obamacare.\n\nHow many truly uninsured people are getting coverage?\n\nObamacare was sold as the way to give cancer survivors and sick children access to care. But that\u2019s not the reality.\n\n\u201cObamacare is not designed to make changes to a good system and make it a better system,\u201d state Sen. Dale Righter, R-Mattoon, told Illinois Watchdog. \u201cObamacare is designed to radically change the system.\u201d\n\nRighter and other state lawmakers say many of the 113,000 people who have gone through the state\u2019s marketplace are simply moving from their old insurance plan to a new Obamacare plan. Thousands more are enrolling in Medicaid.\n\nHow many?\n\nIn Illinois, Obamacare means expanding Medicaid.\n\nClaffey, of the state\u2019s health care office, said 220,000 newly eligible adults have been added to the state\u2019s Medicaid rolls. Thousands of people who have always been eligible for Medicaid have jumped on he system via Obamacare.\n\nIn February, Illinois Healthcare and Family Services director Julie Hamos said a total of 315,000 people have enrolled in Medicaid. She expects as many as 430,000 to be on the rolls by year\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cSometimes we hear low estimates, sometimes we here high estimates,\u201d Righter said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether or not Governor Quinn and the Democrats here in Springfield have any idea how many hundreds of thousands of people will wind up going on the Medicaid program. And they sure don\u2019t have any idea how they are going to pay for it.\u201d\n\nContact Benjamin Yount at Ben@IllinoisWatchdog.org and find him on Twitter @BenYount.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Illinois has some questions to answer about Obamacare and who is signing up.", "title": "5 questions that must be answers about Obamacare sign up in Illinois", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/04/questions.jpg", "url": "http://watchdog.org/136151/obamacare-il-doesnt-know-will-hurt/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Illinois", "tag": "ben domenech,Dale Righter,headcount,Heartland Institute,Illinois,ObamaCare,unanswered questions", "published_time": "2014-04-02T09:31:40+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Illinois has some questions to answer about Obamacare and who is signing up.", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/04/questions.jpg"}, "title": "5 questions that must be answers about Obamacare sign up in Illinois", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Illinois has some questions to answer about Obamacare and who is signing up."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd01fa\"", "article_summary": "Claffey, of the state\u2019s health care office, said 220,000 newly eligible adults have been added to the state\u2019s Medicaid rolls.\nIn Illinois, Obamacare means expanding Medicaid.\nIllinois has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars for funny lists on Buzzfeed and the Onion was to get young people into Obamacare.\n\u201cThe whole point of this law was supposed to get people who were uninsured insured, and it was supposed to lower costs for those who had insurance,\u201d Domenech said.\nAt the end of February, he said, 113,000 people had picked a plan through the state\u2019s marketplace, Get Covered Illinois."}
