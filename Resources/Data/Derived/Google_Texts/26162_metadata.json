Jones caught a perfect 37-yard pass from Matt Ryan to set up Devonta Freeman\u2019s go-ahead 2-yard touchdown run with 1:14 remaining, lifting Atlanta past the New York Giants 24-20 Sunday.\n\nJones tied the club record with 13 receptions, good for 135 yards. His biggest catch was down the left sideline behind Prince Amukamara in the final 90 seconds.\n\n\u201cEvery opportunity that I get, when a ball is thrown at me, I feel like it\u2019s my job to catch it,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI had 15 targets and I caught 13. I think I did OK. I wish I could have caught all 15.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what Ryan expected his favorite target to say.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s constantly trying to be a better teammate, be a better player,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cSometimes you say you\u2019re doing a great job as is. That\u2019s what makes him the special player that he is.\u201d\n\nThe Giants (0-2), whose bad decisions and poor execution cost them last week at Dallas, blew a 20-10 fourth-quarter lead. Leonard Hankerson caught a 10-yard TD pass to bring Atlanta within three. Then Ryan guided the Falcons 70 yards to the winning score.\n\nEli Manning misfired to two open receivers on the Giants\u2019 final drive in another ugly finish for New York.\n\n\u201cWe talk every week about finishing. That wasn\u2019t a finish for me,\u201d coach Tom Coughlin said. \u201cWe talk about don\u2019t keep score, I\u2019ll keep score, and let you know when the game\u2019s over. That\u2019s not what happened.\u201d\n\nIn the first half, Beckham turned a short pass into a 67-yard touchdown, one of New York\u2019s six plays of 19 yards or more. But another late meltdown erased the lead.\n\n\u201cThe competitive nature of the finish of the game has got to improve,\u201d Coughlin added. \u201cIt\u2019s our own doing. There\u2019s nobody to blame but us.\u201d\n\nThe Falcons needed Jones\u2019 big day \u2014 he tied Tony Gonzalez\u2019s club mark for receptions\u2014 because they lost rookie starting running back Tevin Coleman (ribs) in the first half. Ryan turned to the air and threw for 363 yards and one score.\n\nDespite frequent double-team coverage, Beckham, the 2014 Offensive Rookie of the Year, set an NFL mark with 1,495 yards in the first 14 games of a career. He had seven receptions for 146 yards Sunday.\n\nOn his TD, Beckham sped the final 40 yards alone after bursting through a small hole between two defenders who could only flail away.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep attacking,\u201d Beckham said \u201cIt\u2019s not 15, 35, 45 or 50 minutes. It\u2019s 60 minutes.\u201d\n\nShane Vereen made another big play thanks to one of many missed tackles by the sloppy Falcons\u2019 defense. On a short throw from Manning, he got past linebacker Paul Worrilow and sped to a 37-yard gain. Three players later, New York led 20-10 as Larry Donnell made a sliding catch with cornerback Robert Alford on his back.\n\nNew York appeared headed for another score after yet another long gain, a 35-yard run by Andre Williams. But Manning was sacked by Kroy Biermann and fumbled at the Atlanta 9. Ryan immediately hit an uncovered tight end Jacob Tamme for 41 yards.\n\nTamme later was guilty of holding to negate a touchdown, but Ryan\u2019s perfect throw to leaping Hankerson made it 20-17.\n\n\u201cWe work on that every day,\u201d Jones said of the big fourth quarter. \u201cIt was nothing new to us. Nobody got tight. We just went out there and made plays.\u201d\n\nThe Giants lost first-round draft pick Ereck Flowers. The left tackle hobbled off with a sprained left ankle.\n\nNOTES: Coleman got Atlanta\u2019s first touchdown on a 1-yard run, his first NFL TD. \u2026 Giants CB Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie is in the NFL\u2019s concussion protocol program after a second-half injury. \u2026 Josh Brown had field goals of 38 and 44 yards for New York, while Matt Bryant made a 42-yarder for Atlanta. \u2026 Manning finished with 292 yards passing. \u2026 The Giants honored their 1990 NFL championship team at halftime, with former coach Bill Parcells carrying the Lombardi Trophy onto the field.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Julio Jones unstoppable in Falcons\u2019 24-20 win over Giants", "title": "Julio Jones unstoppable in Falcons\u2019 24-20 win over Giants", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/20/julio-jones-unstoppable-in-falcons-24-20-win-over-giants/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150920_041359_julio-jones.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150920_041359_julio-jones.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-20T16:16:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T20:16:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Jones caught a perfect 37-yard pass from Matt Ryan to set up Devonta Freeman\u2019s go-ahead 2-yard touchdown run with 1:14 remaining, lifting Atlanta past the New York Giants 24-20 Sunday.\nJones outshined Odell Beckham Jr., and the Falcons won their second straight game Sunday.\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 Even when he is unstoppable, it\u2019s not good enough for Julio Jones.\nEli Manning misfired to two open receivers on the Giants\u2019 final drive in another ugly finish for New York.\n\u2026 Josh Brown had field goals of 38 and 44 yards for New York, while Matt Bryant made a 42-yarder for Atlanta."}
