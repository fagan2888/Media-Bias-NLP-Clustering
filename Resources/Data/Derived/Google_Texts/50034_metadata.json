Charlie Rangel, D-New York, said at a news conference on Thursday.\n\nIn their letter, the members point to executive action in 201,2 when Obama exercised his discretion to suspend deportations of children of undocumented immigrants, known as Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals.\n\n\"Please, Mr. President, do something,\" said Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois. \"We need you to take the kinds of positive action to help our families.\"\n\nAlthough Obama has used his discretion to save some from deportation, he has aggressively expanded the program. He has expelled more people than any other president: For instance, 410,000 people were deported in 2012, compared with 116,000 in 2001.\n\nIn their letter, the lawmakers say that 1,100 people are deported every day.\n\nObama has shifted the type of immigrants targeted for deportation. While the administration of President George W. Bush targeted working immigrants by raiding workplaces, Obama is focusing on convicted criminals and \"egregious\" immigration violators, including recent border-crossers and illegal re-entrants.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement says its efforts are effective, pointing out that 55% of people deported last year were convicted criminals.\n\n\"Criminalizing American families or giving local law enforcement the responsibility to choose who stays and who goes is not the right option,\" the letter reads.\n\nThe Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform this year, including a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the United States.\n\nThe legislation has been stalled in the House and is unlikely to be taken up before the end of the year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While immigration reform is stalled in Congress, some members are calling on President Obama to \"suspend\" deportations of undocumented immigrants.", "pubdate": "2013-12-05T19:41:54Z", "author": "By Leigh Ann Caldwell, CNN", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "While immigration reform is stalled in Congress, some members are calling on President Obama to \"suspend\" deportations of undocumented immigrants.", "pubdate": "2013-12-05T19:41:54Z", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/05/politics/democrats-immigrant-deportation/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131125205725-ac-obama-critics-00005605-t3-entertainment.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131125205725-ac-obama-critics-00005605-t3-entertainment.jpg", "source": "CNN", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/05/politics/democrats-immigrant-deportation/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, Dems to Obama: Suspend deportations - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2013-12-05T21:20:28Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbec8\"", "article_summary": "In their letter, the members point to executive action in 201,2 when Obama exercised his discretion to suspend deportations of children of undocumented immigrants, known as Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals.\nThirty Democratic members of Congress wrote in a letter that he has the authority to pause deportations of undocumented immigrants, urging \"the sensible and moral step of stopping deportations.\"\nThe Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform this year, including a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the United States.\nStory highlights Some lawmakers call on President Obama to suspend deportationsThey are the most prominent of a growing chorus of voices pushing the PresidentImmigration reform is stalled in the House of RepresentativesWhile immigration reform is stalled in Congress, some members are calling on President Barack Obama to take the matter into his own hands, urging him to suspend deportations of undocumented immigrants.\nJUST WATCHED Obama heckled at immigration speech Replay More Videos ...
