Reuters\n\nAfter Monday\u2019s announcement that Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino would join 14 other former NFL players in a lawsuit against the league, claiming it misled players about their risks for concussion, Marino has now withdrawn, the Sun-Sentinel reported.\n\nSince the first diagnosis in 2002, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) \u2014 a neurodegenerative disease similar to dementia, but only visible after death \u2014 has made the news countless times, and often in the same breath as the NFL. Droves of ex-athletes are now emerging from retirement with lifelong brain damage that, they allege, was sustained as a result of multiple, sub-concussive hits during their careers.\n\nOriginally, Marino and 14 other players intended to sue the NFL for falsely advertising the risks involved with professional football. The league attempted to rectify the swelling issue last August, when it proposed a settlement of $765 million. This money would go toward funding medical exams, compensating sufferers, and facilitating research. In January, a federal judge blocked that settlement, however. Since 2011, more than 4,500 of the 18,000 total retired football players have sued the league for damages they didn\u2019t know could happen.\n\nMarino, who retired in 1999, was reportedly onboard as of Monday, but has since backed out. A source told the Sun-Sentinel that it was never Marino\u2019s intention to \u201cinitiate litigation, but to ensure that in the event he had adverse health consequences down the road, he would be covered with health benefits,\u201d the source said.\n\nMarino has previously stated that he\u2019s sustained two concussions over his 17-year career, with the traumatic, sub-concussive blows that have become the grim hallmark of retired football stars. Other players still involved in the lawsuit claim unspecific damages and medical monitoring, the Associated Press reported. The lawsuit does not specify any medical problems.\n\nIn these cases, CTE and other neurological damage results from fairly predictable sources. Players who throw themselves at each other, despite the padding afforded by their helmets, unknowingly send their brains bashing into the insides of their skulls. Over time, this intense jostling creates long-term damage. Players exit professional football with slurred speech, degraded memories, and deficient motor skills.\n\nMaking matters worse in years prior was an absent tackling policy in the NFL. Before March of 2013, players were not penalized if they led with their head to execute a tackle. Now, any tackle that clearly comes in head-first is served a 15-yard penalty. \u201cThe sensitivity has changed dramatically over the last, probably, five years,\u201d Howard Katz, senior vice president of media operations for the NFL, told The New York Times. \u201cNobody thought anything about the crashing helmets and the implication of the crashing helmets,\u201d he said of his prior experience at Monday Night Football.\n\nMarino\u2019s decision will ultimately be released as early as late Tuesday, depending on how discussions go between the NFL and the players involved. \u201cThey are working to correct the error,\u201d a source said to the Sun-Sentinel.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "dan, marino, reportedly, withdraws, name, nfl, lawsuit, over, unstated, concussion, risk", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino initially joined 14 football players in suing the NFL, but now he may be backing out.", "title": "Is Dan Marino Suing The NFL For Concussion Damages?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dan-marino-reportedly-withdraws-name-nfl-lawsuit-over-unstated-concussion-risk-286210", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/03/marino.com%2C0000-newsml_TM3EA630W1701-818662365", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino initially joined 14 football players in suing the NFL, but now he may be backing out.", "title": "Is Dan Marino Suing The NFL For Concussion Damages?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dan-marino-reportedly-withdraws-name-nfl-lawsuit-over-unstated-concussion-risk-286210", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/03/marino.com%2C0000-newsml_TM3EA630W1701-818662365", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/03/marino.com%2C0000-newsml_TM3EA630W1701-818662365"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-03T14:58:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-03T14:58:49-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino initially joined 14 football players in suing the NFL, but now he may be backing out."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb51e\"", "article_summary": "Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino initially joined 14 football players in suing the NFL, but now he may be backing out.\nSince 2011, more than 4,500 of the 18,000 total retired football players have sued the league for damages they didn\u2019t know could happen.\nOriginally, Marino and 14 other players intended to sue the NFL for falsely advertising the risks involved with professional football.\nReutersAfter Monday\u2019s announcement that Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino would join 14 other former NFL players in a lawsuit against the league, claiming it misled players about their risks for concussion, Marino has now withdrawn, the Sun-Sentinel reported.\nMarino, who retired in 1999, was reportedly onboard as of Monday, but has since backed out."}
