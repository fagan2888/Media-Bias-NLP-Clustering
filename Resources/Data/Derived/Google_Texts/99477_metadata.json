Ultimately, they found the surfaces to be no more contaminated than surfaces around the average person\u2019s home, despite the restroom\u2019s reputation as a bacterial breeding ground.\n\nAfter sterilizing the various surfaces, scientists tracked the hourly, daily, and weekly progression of certain bacteria. They noticed distinct trends according to both the type of bacteria and their location. For instance, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a potentially fatal strain of bacteria, was found in significant concentrations on the floor. But, according to co-author and microbial ecologist at the University of Chicago, Professor Jack Gilbert, \u201cthe predominant Staph organisms didn't harbor those genes, so MRSA may be there but it is very rare.\u201d\n\nThis difference, Gilbert says, can serve as a good indicator for which surfaces are actually harmful. \u201cA key criterion of healthy or unhealthy might be the presence or relative abundance of pathogens,\u201d he said in a statement. Floors, for instance, tended to show a rapid decline in the bacteria phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, both of which get widely distributed through the environment \u2014 say, on the bottom of people\u2019s shoes or on the surface of their clothes. Other forms declined in a matter of hours.\n\nGilbert found that 68 to 98 percent of bacteria cultures were related to skin and the outdoors. At most 15 percent were the result of fecal bacteria. And many of the common viruses associated with bacteria presence were found in \u201cunexpectedly low\u201d concentrations, \u201csuggesting that bacterial hosts are mostly dormant on [built environment] surfaces,\u201d the researchers wrote in their study abstract.\n\nAdmittedly, some of the least contaminated surfaces are the ones people use the most. This is generally because people take the precaution of wiping down a toilet seat before using it, and the added sterilization by the janitorial staff at the end of the day. It\u2019s the surfaces everyone uses without thinking that tend to be the germiest, such as the door knob, which everyone uses but not always after washing their hands.\n\nAnother component is stability. In Gilbert\u2019s study, the bacteria passed around from the toilet tended to die rather quickly. \u201cWe hypothesized that while enteric bacteria would be dispersed rapidly due to toilet flushing, they would not survive long, as most are not good competitors in cold, dry, oxygen-rich environments,\u201d he said. \u201cAs such, we expected the skin microbes to take over, which is exactly what we found.\u201d\n\nWhat this boils down to is a room not-so-germy on its own, when used for its intended purpose, but made all the more disgusting when we track other bacteria in from the outside. So while many public restrooms have shifted to hands-free dispensers for soap, water, and paper towels, research suggests the damage may already be done, just not to the extent we normally fear.\n\nSource: Gibbons S, Schwartz T, Fouquier J, et al.
