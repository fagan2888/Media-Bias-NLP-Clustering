I woke up a poor man. I lost all my money.\u201d That was the tearful lament of 65-year-old John Demetriou, who lives in the fishing village of Leopetri on Cyprus\u2019 southern coast. In one fell swoop, he lost his life savings \u2014 the result of 35 years of hard work and thrift \u2014 in the \u201ccapital levy\u201d imposed on Cyprus by the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank (ECB), a trio commonly known as the Troika.\n\nIn March of last year, the Troika announced that as part of its deal for resolving the Cypriot banking/financial crisis, Cyprus would have to impose a \u201cone-off capital levy,\u201d a one-time tax on savings deposits in Cypriot banks. This was sold to the public globally and in the EU as a necessary and just solution because Cyprus had become a haven for money laundering and Russian \u201coligarchs.\u201d However, it was small depositors, not the big speculators, institutional bondholders, or Russian billionaires, who took the hit. According to reports from Cypriot, Italian, and German media, as much as 20 billion euros fled Cypriot banks in the early months of 2013, with 4.5 billion euros taking flight in just the week before the banks were closed and accounts frozen. Some of the \u201csmart money\u201d folks who were in the early capital flight, undoubtedly, were merely savvy savers who could see the writing on the wall and wisely moved their assets before the politicians could grab them. But credible reports charge that Cypriot president Nikos Anastasiades and Troika officials warned insider banking friends about the coming \u201chaircut,\u201d thus allowing those most responsible for the financial debacle to escape the levy, and leaving Demetriou, and tens of thousands like him, to foot the bill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Russian money, it\u2019s not black money. It\u2019s my money,\u201d Demetriou told the Sydney Morning Herald. Demetriou fled to Australia from Cyprus with his wife and children in the early 1970s, during the country\u2019s war with Turkey. Starting with nothing, he worked long hours six and seven days a week selling jewelry in the Sydney area markets. He retired to his native Cyprus in 2007, having amassed a respectable nest egg of nearly $1 million. He intended to build a home and have sufficient money to live comfortably and take care of his medical expenses. But those hopes and dreams have been largely wiped out; he may end up losing up to 90 percent of his savings.\n\nDemetriou is but one of the many victims devastated by the Cypriot \u201chaircut.\u201d For many of them, especially elderly pensioners unable to go out and work to recoup the losses, a more accurate description would be \u201camputation,\u201d or even \u201cdecapitation.\u201d\n\nHowever, regardless which anatomical metaphor is adopted, the key point is that the IMF-imposed \u201clevy\u201d should be named for what it truly was: a very brazen form of state confiscation, theft, robbery, plunder. And it represents a dangerous new phase in the politico-economic development of the \u201cnew world order.\u201d It is not mere chance that the \u201ccapital levy\u201d for common depositors was first tried on tiny Cyprus. With a population of barely a million and accounting for merely 0.2 percent of the eurozone GDP, Cyprus is an easy mark, and \u2014 from the standpoint of the Troika globalists \u2014 a good experimental case.\n\nBut to those who are paying attention, the signals are unmistakable that the lords of finance in the central banking fraternity do not view this as a \u201cone-off\u201d event; they plan to use this \u201ctool\u201d very broadly in the coming months. Indeed, the IMF and top central banking maestros have already said so, as we will show. And we are already seeing permutations of this (as in Poland) with the nationalization of private pension funds, and replays (as in Canada and New Zealand), with proposals for Cyprus-style depositor \u201cbail-ins.\u201d But the big prize being eyed, of course, is the United States. If you think that what has happened to Cyprus and Poland can\u2019t happen here, you may end up, tragically, like John Demetriou, destitute and pauperized. Not only that, but you may find that, like the Cypriots, you have lost your freedom, your independence, and national sovereignty; that the policies affecting you most directly are being dictated by international bankers and bureaucrats beyond accountability through elections and national laws.\n\nWhat the Cyprus/Poland experiences have very dramatically shown is that when the IMF and its allied politicians, economists, and central bankers start talking about \u201ccapital levies\u201d it\u2019s time to hide every penny you can. What they really mean is they intend to confiscate anything they can find: savings accounts, checking accounts, investments, pensions, home equity. But that is not all. In addition to a globally coordinated wave of \u201ccapital levy\u201d taxation, the IMF/central banks axis of evil is also pushing an agenda of global inflation (under the labels of \u201cstimulus\u201d and \u201cquantitative easing\u201d) and global regulation (under the label of \u201cmacroprudential policy\u201d). Global taxation, inflation, and regulation \u2014 all of which are aimed at confiscating global economic wealth \u2014 are a path to concentrating, and then confiscating, global political power.\n\nTaking the Cyprus Tax Global\n\nIn October 2013, a study in the IMF\u2019s Fiscal Monitor entitled \u201cTaxing Times\u201d sent shivers and shocks through the financial world. Among the most jarring proposals in the 107-page report is the suggestion of a \u201cone-off capital levy.\u201d Following so closely on the heels of the IMF\u2019s Cyprus levy, the implications are ominous, to say the least. According to the IMF\u2019s \u201cTaxing Times\u201d:\n\nThe sharp deterioration of the public finances in many countries has revived interest in a \u201ccapital levy\u201d \u2014 a one-off tax on private wealth \u2014 as an exceptional measure to restore debt sustainability. The appeal is that such a tax, if it is implemented before avoidance is possible and there is a belief that it will never be repeated, does not distort behavior (and may be seen by some as fair). There have been illustrious supporters, including Pigou, Ricardo, Schumpeter, and \u2014 until he changed his mind \u2014 Keynes.\n\nGet that? It has to be sold as a one-time event that will never be repeated, an \u201cexceptional measure\u201d for \u201csustainability.\u201d And it has to be sprung suddenly, so that savers can\u2019t run to the bank and pull out their funds. That involves imposing \u201cbank holidays\u201d and other \u201ccapital controls,\u201d which we will discuss further on.\n\nSo, how much are they planning to take? The IMF authors state:\n\nThe tax rates needed to bring down public debt to pre-crisis levels are sizable: reducing debt ratios to end-2007 levels would require \u2026 a tax rate of about 10 percent on households with positive net worth.\n\nRomain Hatchuel, the managing partner of asset-manager Square Advisors, warns that the IMF proposal signals a huge danger. In a Wall Street Journal article of December 3, 2013, entitled \u201cThe Coming Global Wealth Tax,\u201d Hatchuel noted that the IMF levy would be much higher for the United States than 10 percent, and could surpass 70 percent! Hatchuel explained:\n\nAs the IMF calculates, the ... revenue-maximizing [tax] rate ... is around 60 percent, way above existing levels.\n\nFor the U.S., it is [between] 56% and 71% \u2014 far more than the current 45% paid \u2026 by those in the top tax bracket....\n\nFrom New York to London \u2026 powerful economic players are deciding that with an ever-deteriorating global fiscal outlook, conventional levels and methods of taxation will no longer suffice. That makes weapons of mass wealth destruction \u2014 such as the IMF\u2019s one-off capital levy ... \u2014 likelier by the day.\n\nWeapons of mass wealth destruction indeed \u2014 and wealth transfer to those who are politically connected. And if you believe that this would be a one-time (or \u201cone-off\u201d) event, you probably still believe the promises that the Greek bailout would be a one-off event, or that under ObamaCare if you want to keep your current insurance plan or your current physician, you can keep them. Period.\n\nThe IMF study reignited the fears and fury that had erupted months earlier, in March, owing to remarks by eurozone chief Jeroen Dijsselbloem that the Cyprus levy on bank accounts could be a template for dealing with similar banking crises across Europe. In a March 25 interview with the Financial Times and Reuters, Dijsselbloem said the Cyprus gambit would be repeated elsewhere \u201cif necessary.\u201d Those remarks triggered immediate declines in European markets, prompting the eurozone finance ministers to come up with a reversal on March 26 asserting, \u201cThe Cypriot program is not a template, but measures are tailor-made to the very exceptional Cypriot situation.\u201d\n\nHowever, three months later, on June 26, the eurozone finance ministers reversed their reversal and confirmed that more capital levies (which they sometimes euphemistically refer to as \u201cstability fees\u201d and \u201cstability levies\u201d) would indeed be the model for dealing with troubled banks. \u201cFor the first time, we agreed on a significant bail-in to shield taxpayers,\u201d Dijsselbloem announced, after a seven-hour, late-night huddle with the other finance ministers.\n\nBailout or Bail-in?\n\n\u201cBail-in.\u201d That\u2019s another of the crafty neologisms the weasels of finance have coined to throw off the bumpkins who are rebelling against further taxpayer-funded bank bailouts. In a bail-in, supposedly, the bondholders (mostly institutions) and bank shareholders, followed by savings depositors, would foot the bill for risky bank portfolios (toxic mortgage-backed securities, for instance) that go sour. But as we\u2019ve seen over and over again, the big insider institutions most responsible for the speculative bubbles get off the hook and leave others holding the bag.\n\nThe usual enablers in the establishment media choir have been assisting in the subterfuge, pitching the new EU policy on capital levies as a boon relief to taxpayers and a long-overdue squeeze on \u201cwealthy\u201d investors and savers. \u201cThe European Union agreed ... to force investors and wealthy savers to share the costs of future bank failures, moving closer to drawing a line under years of taxpayer-funded bailouts that have prompted public outrage,\u201d reported Reuters on June 27, 2013.\n\n\u201cThe European Union spent the equivalent of a third of its economic output on saving its banks between 2008 and 2011,\u201d noted the Reuters story, \u201cusing taxpayer cash but struggling to contain the crisis and \u2014 in the case of Ireland \u2014 almost bankrupting the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Reuters continued, \u201ca bailout of Cyprus in March that forced losses on depositors marked a harsher approach that can now, following [the June 27] agreement, be replicated elsewhere.\u201d Can now ... be replicated elsewhere \u2014 as the IMF study proposes.\n\nThe voters/taxpayers are supposed to be so relieved by the announcement that their torturers will stop turning the thumbnail screws that they miss the follow-up message: The torture team will start pulling toenails instead. But Team Hannibal Lector at the IMF/ECB/EU Troika would, no doubt, put it more delicately: They will be switching from a stability manicure to a stability pedicure!\n\nHow credible are the assurances that the new EU capital levies will be aimed at the big institutional gamers and not at the small depositors, the middle class savers? About as reliable as all of the previous broken promises that the politicians and central bankers have made regarding one bailout after another. After all, only one month before the Cyprus bail-in, Dijs\u00adselbloem cobbled together a 3.7 billion euro taxpayer bailout/nationalization of SNS Reaal, the fourth-largest bank in the Netherlands, that was stuffed with zombie real estate loans. In that deal, Dijsselbloem protected SNS Reaal\u2019s senior bondholders, using the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d argument in his explanation to the Dutch Parliament. The banking maestros realized that public anger over this and previous bailouts had reached the point that required a new fleecing strategy. Voila!: the \u201cbail-in\u201d was born and packaged as the taxpayers\u2019 friend.\n\nHowever, many economists, investors, financial advisors, economic analysts, pundits, and \u201cplain Joes\u201d recognize the confiscatory capital levy/bail-in for the government-sponsored theft that it truly is. Among the naysayers is famed investor/author and commodities tycoon Jim Rogers. Following the annual meeting of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in August 2013, Rogers expressed his belief that the confab presaged a massive taxation and inflation plundering campaign on the global level. \u201cThey\u2019re going to take money wherever they can,\u201d he warned. \u201cThey\u2019re going to take our bank accounts and retirement accounts.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cthey\u201d he refers to are the central bankers and their insider commercial banker colleagues \u2014 and national governments, which serve as the collection agencies for the bankers. \u201cThis is the first time in recorded history all the banks are printing money at the same time.... This is the first time we\u2019ve had massive debasement [of currencies], and it\u2019s going to end very badly no matter what they say,\u201d Rogers said in a remote video interview with Greg Hunter of USAWatchdog.com.\n\n\u201cWhether they keep printing or stop printing money globally, it is going to end badly,\u201d Rogers continued. Rogers concluded by saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve had perilous times, and it\u2019s going to get worse.... It\u2019s coming, be worried, be careful.\u201d\n\nAs we mentioned above, expropriating depositors\u2019 bank savings is but one of the \u201ccapital levy\u201d options available to insatiable governments and central banks; state pensions and private pensions are also increasingly irresistible targets. Argentina\u2019s President Cristina Kirchner kicked off the practice in 2008 with the nationalization of $30 billion in private pension holdings to pay off government debts. (To this she has added capital controls, such as limiting cash withdrawals using credit cards, which has led to massive foreign and domestic capital flight from Argentina, South America\u2019s second largest economy).\n\nIn 2009, the Irish government raided the National Reserve Pension fund of 4 billion euros to rescue troubled banks. Then in 2010 it came back to clean out the 2.5 billion euros that were left to cover government spending. Hungary followed the same course in 2010. Nationalizing private pensions was the beginning of a series of nationalizations of private companies to pay government debts. Prime Minister Viktor Orban has pushed government takeovers of energy, auto parts manufacturing, waterworks, and more. In September 2013, Poland\u2019s Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, announced his government\u2019s confiscation of bonds held in private pension funds. It is using these resources to feed the government\u2019s ravenous appetite. With help and encouragement from the IMF and central banks \u2014 and with virtually all governments on non-stop spending binges \u2014 this trend is all but certain to escalate.\n\nIn his January 28, 2014 State of the Union address, President Obama provided a warning of things to come, announcing that he (without any authorization from Congress) was directing the U.S. Treasury to launch a new retirement savings bond program, the MyRA. He didn\u2019t say \u201cIf you like your current IRA or pension plan, you can keep it \u2014 period,\u201d but does he need to? After the ObamaCare experience, anyone above room temperature should be able to recognize another mandatory, statist program coming their way.\n\nGlobalized Inflation\n\nBut direct confiscation of assets isn\u2019t the only \u2014 or even the chief \u2014 plan of the ruling elites to purloin your wealth; the more traditional means by which governments accomplish this is by increasing the money supply (inflation), which robs everyone by stealing some of the value of each dollar in each wallet, purse, mattress, savings account, checking account, pension fund, mutual fund, IRA, etc. Since the start of the 2008 financial crisis, the world\u2019s central banks have been pumping out trillions of dollars, euros, pounds, yen, and other currencies in an unprecedented coordinated orgy of global \u201cstimulus.\u201d Nevertheless, say the money maestros, even more of the same is urgently needed to spare us from the imminent threat of deflation! The new year was barely out of the starting gate when Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, announced at a speech in Washington, D.C., that she has set her sights on slaying the \u201cogre of deflation,\u201d a term she mentioned more than once. Speaking at the National Press Club on January 15, 2014, the IMF chief warned: \u201cWith inflation running below many central banks\u2019 targets, we see rising risks of deflation, which could prove disastrous for the recovery.\u201d \u201cIf inflation is the genie,\u201d she said, \u201cthen deflation is the ogre that must be fought decisively.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis crisis still lingers,\u201d said Lagarde, but continued: \u201cYet, optimism is in the air: the deep freeze is behind, and the horizon is brighter.\u201d\n\nBut attaining that bright horizon will mean empowering Lagarde and her fellow banking maestros with vast new authority \u2014 and mountains of cash. \u201cGetting beyond the crisis still requires a sustained and substantial policy effort, coordination, and the right policy mix,\u201d declared the IMF\u2019s panjandrum. Key ingredients of that mix, she has said again and again, are expanded government spending (i.e., \u201cstimulus\u201d) and expanded money supply (i.e., \u201cquantitative easing\u201d). Lagarde and her central banker cohorts refer to these policies as \u201cunconventional monetary policies\u201d or UMP.\n\nQuantitative easing, or QE, has become a fairly familiar term to many Americans since the Federal Reserve System introduced it in 2008. It began with the purchase of hundreds of billions of dollars of toxic mortgage-backed securities from troubled institutions. By June of 2010, the Fed purchases had ballooned to more than $2.1 trillion and included mortgage-backed securities, bank debt, and U.S. Treasury securities. By November 2010, the Fed was ready to launch QE2, the second round of \u201cquantitative easing,\u201d resulting in purchases of more hundreds of billions of dollars of bad loans and Treasury bonds. In September 2012 the Fed launched one of its most audacious UMP programs, which became known as QE3, to begin an open-ended, indefinite monthly purchase of mortgage-backed securities and Treasury debt instruments. Critics dubbed it \u201cQE-Infinity.\u201d After only three months, the Fed bumped up its purchases from the already astronomical sum of $40 billion per month to $85 billion per month. In December 2013 the Fed announced that it would be \u201ctapering\u201d its monthly purchases to $75 billion per month beginning in January 2014.\n\nFrom the start of QE1, millions of Americans recognized that it was a gigantic fraud through which the Fed was transferring the loss of trillions of dollars in bad loans and government debt from the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks on Wall Street to the middle class/working class folks on Main Street. Millions more Americans began to catch on when a partial audit of the Fed by the General Accountability Office (GAO) in 2011 \u2014 thanks to legislation sponsored by congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul \u2014 pried open the Fed\u2019s secret records and revealed that trillions of dollars had been funneled into the world\u2019s biggest and wealthiest banks and corporations: JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, Barclays, Bear Stearns, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, and others.\n\nThe Fed is not the only central bank that is plundering the savers and taxpayers for the benefit of the banking and corporate elites; the European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of England (BOE), and most other central banks have joined in the extortion game, insisting that the UMP bailouts and \u201cstimulus\u201d programs are necessary to avoid \u201csystemic risk,\u201d \u201ccontagion,\u201d and \u201cglobal meltdown.\u201d But every dollar that the Fed creates out of thin air subtracts a dollar\u2019s worth of value from the supply of dollars already in existence and transfers that value to the government, or to the central banks and their commercial banking colleagues. And we\u2019re talking about tens of trillions of those dollars created in the past six years. Everyday Americans eventually experience the pain of the eroding value of the dollar in the form of price increases on everything from food, gasoline, clothing, appliances, and cars to housing and utility bills.\n\nThe \u201cParked Reserves\u201d Avalanche\n\nWhat has mystified many market observers is that despite unprecedented levels of money creation by the central banks since the beginning of the 2008 crisis, the inflationary effects of all that activity have not materialized as expected. Gold prices and other commodity prices are down, defying conventional wisdom. Why? The answer is UMP \u2014 unconventional monetary policy. More specifically, it is the Fed\u2019s UMP decision to pay interest on \u201cexcess reserves.\u201d As we have explained previously in these pages (\u201cNow, More Than Ever, Time to Audit the Fed,\u201d February 20, 2012), in 2008 the Fed began an unprecedented policy of paying commercial banks billions of dollars in interest to keep trillions of dollars \u201cparked\u201d in what are known as \u201cexcess reserves,\u201d rather than lending those dollars out to individuals and businesses.\n\nDoug French, president of the Mises Institute, explained the excess reserves situation in a December 2013 article for Casey Research entitled \u201cA Fed Policy Change That Will Increase the Gold Price.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommercial banks are required a keep a certain amount of money on deposit at the Fed based upon how much they hold in customer deposits,\u201d French noted. \u201cBanking being a leveraged business, bankers don\u2019t normally keep any more money than they have to at the Fed so they can use the money to make loans or buy securities and earn interest. Anything extra they keep at the Fed is called excess reserves.\u201d\n\nFrench continued:\n\nUp until when Lehman Brothers failed in September of 2008, excess reserves were essentially zero. A month later, the central bank began paying banks 25 basis points on these reserves and five years later banks \u2014 mostly the huge mega-banks \u2014 have $2.5 trillion parked in excess reserves.\n\n\u201cI heard a bank stock analyst tell an investment crowd this past summer the banks don\u2019t really benefit from the 25 basis points,\u201d said French, \u201cbut we\u2019re talking $6.25 billion a year in income the banks have been receiving courtesy of a change made during the panicked heart of bailout season 2008. This has been a pure government subsidy to the banking industry, and one the public has been blissfully ignorant of.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut now everything looks rosy in Bankland again,\u201d French noted. \u201cThe banks collectively made $36 billion in the third quarter [of 2013] after earning over $42 billion the previous quarter \u2014 showing big profits by reserving a fraction of what they had previously for loan losses.\u201d\n\nYes, while Main Street businesses have been unable to get loans, the Wall Street cronies with ties to the Fed have had no trouble with liquidity. And the banks have no incentive to make loans, as long as the Fed keeps paying them not to.\n\nHowever, the Fed could stop paying interest and cause those excess reserves to be released. And the Fed could spring that on us at any time, with calamitous results for everyone \u2014 except, of course, for Fed insiders, who would know ahead of time and could reap huge profits from everyone else\u2019s losses. Steve Hanke, professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University, explains that the Fed creates roughly 15 percent of the money supply (what he calls \u201cstate money\u201d), while the banks create \u201cbank money,\u201d which is the remaining 85 percent of the money supply. This is the fraudulent \u201cmagic\u201d of fractional-reserve banking under the Fed, which allows banks to issue several dollars in loans for every dollar actually held in reserve. When the pent-up \u201cparked excess reserves\u201d are let loose, they could expand to several times $2.5 trillion, unleashing an inflationary avalanche.\n\nThe European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and other central banks have been pursuing parallel actions. \u201cThe continental European and US experiences with excess reserves since the onset of the present crisis have been similar,\u201d writes Walker F. Todd in The Problem of Excess Reserves, Then and Now, published by the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College in May 2013. According to the Todd study, \u201cThe ECB experience has been roughly comparable to the Fed\u2019s experience: Much monetary creation and much expansion of the balance sheet and monetary base producing comparatively little credit expansion.\u201d\n\nAnd, like the Fed, the ECB could reverse its excess reserve policy at any moment, swamping markets with pent-up euros. Considering the size of the excess reserve overhang, the unprecedented nature of the central banks\u2019 payment of interest on them, and the devastating potential of their release, it is incredible (and unconscionable) that the mainstream media financial reporters and pundits have almost completely ignored this elephant hiding under the doily. Ditto for the politicians (both liberal and conservative) who prattle on about the financial crisis, denouncing corruption and special interests, while prostrating themselves in obeisance before the banking lobby.\n\nMacrofraudential Policies\n\nOver the past century, virtually every nation has established a central bank, and all have adopted the fraudulent practice of fractional-reserve banking. And like the U.S. Federal Reserve System, they tend to operate under a veil of secrecy, exempt from the audits that all other government agencies and private corporations are subjected to. Many of them, like the Federal Reserve, have an enormous conflict of interest built into them in that they are hybrid monstrosities, neither fish nor fowl. The Federal Reserve banks are privately owned but enjoy special government-conferred privileges and status.\n\nThe activities of the world\u2019s central banks have become increasingly coordinated and knit together on the global level through the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland, the European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany, and the IMF, which is based in Washington, D.C. The BIS, ECB, and IMF have been working hand-in-glove with the Fed and the major Wall Street banksters to craft \u201cmacroprudential policies\u201d that now threaten everyone on the planet. In order to promote stability and protect ourselves against \u201csystemic risk\u201d say the \u201cmacro\u201d advocates, we must grant central banks \u2014 the people and institutions most responsible for the global financial crisis \u2014 more powers to regulate every aspect of economic life.\n\nThe Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), headquartered at the BIS in Basel, has taken the lead on macroprudential policies. William C. Dudley is chairman of the CGFS; he is also president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (and former chief economist for Goldman Sachs). In May 2010, the CGFS issued \u201cCGFS Papers No 38: Macroprudential instruments and frameworks.\u201d The IMF, the Fed, the Bank of England, the ECB, and other central banks and their pet economists in academe have been jumping on board the macroprudential wagon. This is an expanded replay of the deception that resulted in the creation of the Federal Reserve System 100 years ago. As today, people were furious at the Wall Street banks, following the financial Panic of 1910-11. The Federal Reserve Act, which was packaged and marketed as a means to put a leash on the Wall Street \u201cMoney Trust,\u201d was actually secretly written by and supported by the leading players of the Money Trust. In reality, the act put a choke collar on the American economy and handed the leash to the Wall Street banks that own and control the Fed. It was one of the biggest reverse plays in history. Now the successors of the same Money Trust are trying to invest the IMF with the same powers on a global scale, as amply detailed, for instance, in G. Edward Griffin\u2019s The Creature From Jekyll Island (1994). They know if they can centralize and concentrate global financial power, global political power will follow, as night follows day.\n\nIn 2010, the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed Rep. Ron Paul\u2019s \u201cAudit the Fed\u201d bill. The Wall Street manipulators and their bankster cronies at the Fed, the U.S. Treasury, and the world\u2019s central banks were in a panic. They pulled out all stops and sabotaged the bill in the Senate, watering it down to a one-time, partial audit. Nevertheless, that \u201caudit\u201d revealed such breathtakingly gigantic plundering of the economy and such rampant corruption and criminality that it could not be quickly swept under the rug. For the first time since the creation of the Fed a century earlier, Congressman Paul and liberty-minded forces were able to focus public attention on the globalist financial mafia that is stealing our wealth, our national sovereignty, and our liberty.
