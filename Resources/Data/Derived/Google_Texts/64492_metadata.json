Where did that money go?\u201d Berube asked.\n\nThe technical glitches were no surprise, Berube said, since the Hawaii Health Connector hired CGI Group over the objection of Senate President Donna Mercado Kim, who warned the connector that CGI botched upgrade of the Hawaii tax-collection system.\n\n\u201cWe believe Hawaii residents should be able to securely sign up through your website, but the National Review reported it is one of many state-run exchanges vulnerable to wi-fi attacks, allowing hackers to intercept personal information of those trying to obtain health insurance,\u201d Berube said.\n\nThe news organization deemed Hawaii\u2019s exchange the \u201cnation\u2019s worst.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is quite embarrassing for Hawaii, a state which embraced the Affordable Care Act, to have ranked dead last in the nation in December as the worst state-based exchange,\u201d Berube said.\n\nSanjeev Bhagowalia, the state\u2019s IT director, told state representatives at a Dec. 12 hearing the website still has a number of glitches, and he is worried it\u2019s not secure enough to keep \u201cvery sophisticated foes\u201d \u2014 hackers \u2014 from obtaining confidential information from the site.\n\n\u201cThis is a very serious area and we are not prepared,\u201d Bhagowalia said.\n\nLow enrollment, the cost for each successful sign up and rising rates are issues, too.\n\nHawaii Health Connector Interim Director Tom Matsuda, who took over Dec. 9, said a total of 2,034 people who have enrolled in a health plan and 296 businesses have applied for a health plan through the Hawaii Health Connector as of Dec. 25.\n\nBut Berube said that still breaks down to about $100,000 spent per person and small business that successfully signed up.\n\nThe law\u2019s mandates are already driving up premiums, Berube said, including premiums with Kaiser and HMSA, Hawaii\u2019s two primary insurance providers, which will increase as much as 9.2 percent on thousands of individual and small businesses.\n\nIn addition, the Hawaii Health Connector still isn\u2019t effectively connected to the state\u2019s Medicaid system, which means low-income applicants are stuck in limbo, Berube said.\n\nMeanwhile, Hawaii\u2019s Democrat lawmakers are criticizing the exchange.\n\nRep. Justin Woodson, D-Maui, pressed state Insurance Commissioner Gordon Ito at the Dec. 12 hearing when he admitted the exchange would not lower health insurance rates in Hawaii. Ito told lawmakers the insurance plans obtained through the exchange would probably increase 8 percent to 10 percent per year, in part because of the fees assessed on insurance companies to fund the exchange.\n\nGov. Neil Abercrombie and the Hawaii Health Connector\u2019s board and administration assumed at least 100,000 people \u2014 all of the state\u2019s uninsured \u2014 would sign up for health insurance over the next two years. Initial financial plans for the connector were based on 300,000 people \u2014 or 24 percent of the state\u2019s population \u2014 buying health insurance. But that prediction falls far short.\n\nState officials told lawmakers the Hawaii Health Connector isn\u2019t financially sustainable and, because of that, should be converted from an independent nonprofit to a state agency.\n\nBhagowalia told lawmakers they should consider allowing the state to take over the private nonprofit exchange because 3,000 to 4,000 people signing up through the exchange \u2014 out of a potential 1.4 million \u2014 is \u201cnot a good outlook for us,\u201d and is a business model that won\u2019t survive.\n\nPat McManahan, the state\u2019s human services director, as well as representatives from Kaiser and HMSA health insurance, agreed.\n\nOnce the $204 million runs out the exchange will be expected to fund its $10 million to $14 million in annual operations through fees on local insurance companies. The fees, now at 2 percent, are generated through a percentage of sales made through the exchange.\n\nReach Malia Zimmerman at Malia@hawaiireporter.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Hawaii GOP refuses request to recruit for Obamacare exchange and Hawaii's Democratic lawmakers are also concerned the exchange is failing", "title": "Hawaii GOP refuses request to recruit for Obamacare exchange", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/12/Screen-shot-2013-12-09-at-8.38.35-AM.png", "url": "http://watchdog.org/122465/hawaii-gop-refuses-to-recruit-for-obamacare-exchange/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Hawaii", "tag": "Hawaii democrats,Hawaii Gop,Hawaii health connector,National Review,obamacare exchange,Senate President Donna Mercado Kim", "published_time": "2014-01-06T15:37:28+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Hawaii GOP refuses request to recruit for Obamacare exchange and Hawaii's Democratic lawmakers are also concerned the exchange is failing", "title": "Hawaii GOP refuses request to recruit for Obamacare exchange", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/12/Screen-shot-2013-12-09-at-8.38.35-AM.png"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Hawaii GOP refuses request to recruit for Obamacare exchange and Hawaii's Democratic lawmakers are also concerned the exchange is failing"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6686\"", "article_summary": "Hawaii Health Connector Interim Director Tom Matsuda, who took over Dec. 9, said a total of 2,034 people who have enrolled in a health plan and 296 businesses have applied for a health plan through the Hawaii Health Connector as of Dec. 25.\nBy Malia Zimmerman | Watchdog.orgHONOLULU \u2014 The Hawaii Republican Party has turned down a plea from the Hawaii Health Connector to use party leadership and legislators to recruit for the exchange.\nRep.
