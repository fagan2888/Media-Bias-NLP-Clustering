The findings echo the initial flashpoint of the VA scandal, the 2014 revelation that Phoenix VA staff kept a \"secret waitlist\" to conceal long delays in care.\n\nIn a report to the White House and Congress, U.S. Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner wrote that the an inspection by the VA's inspector general was overly narrow and neglected the issue of wait times.\n\nLerner paralleled the Hines investigation with another investigation into claims of long wait times for mental health providers affecting 2,700 veterans at Shreveport, Louisiana's Overton Brooks Medical Center. The Overton Brooks investigation failed to investigate those claims, and simply concluded that a spreadsheet relating to mental health access was not \"secret.\"\n\nMeanwhile in other VA news, the VA fired Jack Hetrick, the head of its Ohio-based regional network and suspended Barbara Temeck, M.D., acting chief of staff at the Cincinnati VA hospital, with a possible federal criminal investigation to come, according to The Washington Post. Hetrick's ouster came in the wake of a probe into the facility's management and care quality that found misconduct in prescriptions and other care provided by Temeck.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- check out the report (.pdf)\n\n- here's the Tribune article\n\n- read the Post article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nVA scandal: Excess wait times persist at Phoenix facility\n\nVA scandal: No end in sight for patient satisfaction, whistleblower woes\n\nGroup proposes major VA healthcare overhaul\n\nVA scandal: Audit reveals 57,000 vets awaiting medical appointments\n\nVA settles with more whistleblowers as investigators promise better training\n\nVA whistleblowers push for system-wide changes to improve patient care\n\nProcter & Gamble's McDonald vows to reaffirm VA values\n\nWhistleblower reprisals still plague VA\n\nVA settles 25 whistleblower complaints\n\nVA whistleblowers honored\n\nAlleged VA secret wait list cover-up grows larger\n\nWhistleblowers reprisals still plague VA\n\nLittle improvement in VA waittimes after scandal\n\nGovernment investigates 67 claims of VA whistleblower abuse\n\nBanished to the basement: Not all whistleblowers receive windfalls", "article_metadata": {"description": "Adding to the Department of Veterans Affairs' woes, federal investigators this week found a suburban Chicago VA facility neglected whistleblower reports that supervisors were covering up delays in care.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Adding to the Department of Veterans Affairs' woes, federal investigators this week found a suburban Chicago VA facility neglected whistleblower reports that supervisors were covering up delays in care.", "title": "VA scandal: Internal investigations neglected whistleblower concerns", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/va-scandal-internal-investigations-neglected-whistleblower-concerns/2016-02-26", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,hospital misconduct,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,VA scandal,Veterans Affairs,Wait Times", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "The findings echo the initial flashpoint of the VA scandal, the 2014 revelation that Phoenix VA staff kept a \"secret waitlist\" to conceal long delays in care.\nIn 2011, Germaine Clarno reported Hines VA Hospital workers were \"zeroing out\" patient wait times and disguising care delays by avoiding using the hospital's electronic scheduling system, the newspaper reported.\nIn a report to the White House and Congress, U.S. Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner wrote that the an inspection by the VA's inspector general was overly narrow and neglected the issue of wait times.\nAdding to the Department of Veterans Affairs' woes, federal investigators this week found a suburban Chicago VA facility neglected whistleblower reports that supervisors were covering up delays in care, according to the Chicago Tribune.\nLerner paralleled the Hines investigation with another investigation into claims of long wait times for mental health providers affecting 2,700 veterans at Shreveport, Louisiana's Overton Brooks Medical Center."}
