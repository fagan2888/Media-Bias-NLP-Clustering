Hundreds of older stage actors are being kicked off the Actors\u2019 Equity Association health insurance plan after the organization that manages the plan decided the actors were no longer cost-effective, according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nActors\u2019 Equity Association is the largest union for stage actors, representing almost 50,000 actors and stage managers across the United States. The change, which takes effect at the end of this year, was made by the board of trustees for Equity-League Health Fund, the group that manages health plans for the union. It affects union members who pay their own premiums post-Cobra.\n\nIn a July 11 letter obtained by International Business Times, the Equity-League office said the decision was made due to \u201cthe enormous and rising costs\u201d of the self-pay program and because of expanded availability of health insurance due to the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI was flabbergasted,\u201d said one actor, who worked for decades on Broadway and in regional theaters. \u201cMost of us were in shock.\u201d\n\nActors spoke with IBTimes on the condition of anonymity out of fear of being blacklisted by retaliatory theater producers. Many say they feel like they\u2019re being cast aside by a union that had promised to look out for their interests.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n\u201cOf course, we\u2019re not cost-effective,\u201d said one actor. \u201cWe\u2019re older people. You don\u2019t just isolate a few people, the ones who are costing you the most money. That\u2019s not what insurance is.\u201d\n\nMost of the actors being kicked off the plan have not worked under union contracts for some time, but they are still dues-paying Equity members. Many are over 50. They say they are actively pursuing stage work but are finding roles more difficult to come by as they get older.\n\nChris Brockmeyer, co-chair of the Equity-League Trust Fund, said the trustees did not make the decision lightly. He said the fund is facing negative cash flow and that trustees had been considering the change for years. They waited, he said, until alternatives were available through Obamacare.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to simply leave these folks out in the cold,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the availability of health care under the marketplaces, we made the decision that now was the time.\u201d\n\nBrockmeyer said Equity-League spends roughly $3 million a year for the 300 to 400 self-pay members who will be affected by the cuts. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinarily expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the Fund essentially has to pay for this group taken as a whole is about double what it is for the rest of the participants in the plan.\u201d\n\nAffected actors met with Equity-League officials last month and say they were told flat-out that their particular group is costing the too much money. Equity-League used to classify the group as \u201cVested Beyond Cobra,\u201d but actors say the organization quietly dropped the word \u201cvested,\u201d which means \u201cunconditionally guaranteed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was something that was promised to us,\u201d one actor said.\n\nAccording to the letter, the change affects actors in 15 states, including New York and California, where much of the entertainment sector is concentrated. Actors in New York say the Obamacare exchanges in that state offer them no comparable plan, and now they will have to find new doctors. Some say they have developed relationships with their health care professionals over many years, and one actor said he is being treated for a repetitive-stress injury that is a direct result of his stage work.\n\n\u201cThey keep saying there\u2019s a comparable Obamacare option, but there\u2019s not,\u201d one actor said. \u201cI won\u2019t be able to afford to go to [my doctor] anymore.\u201d\n\nSome performers say union stage work is becoming scarcer as as non-union touring shows proliferate. Equity recently launched a social media campaign aimed at Broadway shows that go on tour without union contracts.\n\nA spokeswoman for Equity said the union doesn\u2019t speak on behalf of Equity-League health funds or its participants. However, as some actors pointed out, the union took a different stance when drastic health care cuts were made in 2003 and Patrick Quinn -- then the union\u2019s national president -- openly criticized the trustees who made the decision.\n\nActors say they just want the theater business to treat them with the same respect that they\u2019ve treated it. \u201cI devoted my life to this craft,\u201d one actor said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018You\u2019ve been driving in a BMW. Now go get in this 1972 Ford and hope for the best.\u201d\n\nActors Equity Healthcare Changes\n\nGot a news tip? Email Christopher Zara here.
