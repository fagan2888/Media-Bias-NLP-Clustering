Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina says the United States shouldn't open its doors any wider to welcome Syrian refugees streaming into Europe.

Fiorina cites concerns about terrorism in explaining her position during an interview with CBS' "Face the Nation" that the U.S. "sadly, cannot relax our entrance criteria."

An estimated 4 million refugees have fled Syria since 2011. The United States has accepted about 1,000 Syrians this year among 70,000 refugees from across the world.

Some want the U.S. to expand its refugee program.

Fiorina -- a former Hewlett-Packard CEO -- says the U.S. should be "very careful about who we let enter this country from these war torn regions to ensure that terrorists are not coming here."
