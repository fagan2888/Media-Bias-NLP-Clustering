She also discussed her mother\u2019s lifelong commitment to universal healthcare, saying that before it was Obamacare it was called \u201cClinton-care.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also need to find ways to finish the job of the affordable care act, to incentivize governors like yours who haven't yet expanded Medicaid,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nIn an interview with reporters following her speech, Clinton addressed her mother\u2019s commitment to making renewable energy more available. A day earlier, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Clinton rival said he was committed to expanding solar energy capture in Florida.\n\n\u201cMy mother had a plan for expanding renewable energy before Senator Sanders did,\u201d Chelsea said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t only be about solar energy. We are in a place where it shines a lot, but in other places where the wind blows really hard or where we can access geothermal energy.\u201d\n\nChelsea Clinton was introduced to the crowd Friday by St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman. Both Kriseman and across the bay in Tampa, Mayor Bob Buckhorn, have recently come out in support of Hillary Clinton.\n\nAt Friday\u2019s rally, Kriseman said that in addition to her foreign policy experience as Secretary of State, he believe Clinton\u2019s commitment to supporting local governments makes her a better pick than Sanders for Florida.\n\n\"She get's the importance of small business and we are a community here of small businesses. She understands the role and the important role that cities play in our world,\u201d he said.\n\nClinton will face off against Sanders in Florida\u2019s Democratic primary on Tuesday.
