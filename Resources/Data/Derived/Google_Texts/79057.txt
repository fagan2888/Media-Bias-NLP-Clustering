Sioux Falls, SD

The South Dakota Highway Patrol is trying to add more women to its almost all-male ranks.



The patrol has five active female troopers and one in training. It has almost 170 male troopers.



The Department of Public Safety has been hosting recruiting seminars around the state with the hope of bringing more women onto the force, but only one saw a turnout.



Four women came to the Sioux Falls seminar this week, which was run by Trooper Deanna Johnson.



Johnson says she wants to bring more women onto the force to provide a new perspective.



She says she's never been treated differently, is the first woman to be a drug-dog handler in the state and is often told by colleagues she's their preferred backup.
