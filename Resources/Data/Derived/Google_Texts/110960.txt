Wichita fire crews say a child playing with candles started a house fire on Christmas Day.

Firefighters were called around 11:45 a.m. Friday to a fire in the 1200 block of North Jackson Avenue, near 13th and Waco. They arrived to find smoke billowing from the home.

Crews quickly got the fire under control, which was concentrated in one of the bedrooms.

Investigators say the fire caused about $50,000 in damage. No one was hurt.
