Weed a garden, wash cars, pick vegetables \u2013 whatever you have to do to make a living and avoid being on the dole. It can help save the U.S.A.\n\nThat\u2019s one of the messages in conservative activist Ben Carson\u2019s new book, One Nation: What We Can Do to Save America\u2019s Future. \u201cIt may not make you a millionaire, but certainly can pay the bills and put food on the table,\u201d says Carson, not caring a whit about political correctness, something he\u2019s well known for disdaining.\n\nRelated: The Black Conservative Who Could Save the GOP\n\nThe former pediatric neurosurgeon argues that individual actions and responsibility can help right a nation badly off the rudder of fiscal and economic responsibility. The message \u2013 however much it grates against blue-state sensibilities \u2013 is resonating. His book debuted at number one on The New York Times hardcover nonfiction bestseller list several weeks ago and is still hovering near the top \u2013 a notch below Hillary Clinton\u2019s new memoir, Hard Choices, as of this week.\n\nA registered independent and devout Seventh Day Adventist Christian, Carson pole-vaulted to national prominence after he spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C., in February 2013. With President Obama sitting just a few feet away, Carson took swipes at a liberal government that he said contributed to the growing national debt \u2013 threatening the country\u2019s economic future.\n\n\u201cWe have to deal with this,\u201d he said then, something he repeats in his new book: \u201cWe are killing the next generation. We have to think about that.\u201d\n\nWith his fiery rhetoric and conservative bona fides, Carson\u2019s political star has been on the rise. At last year\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Carson said he might potentially be open to a bigger political role in Washington: \u201cLet\u2019s say you magically put me in the White House\u201d \u2013 which brought attendants to their feet. At this year\u2019s CPAC, he said, \u201cThe majority of people in this country have common sense \u2013 the problem is they have been beaten into submission.\u201d\n\nRelated: Dick Cheney\u2019s Swipe at Obama Divides the GOP\n\nStill, many people take Carson to task for, among other things, his opposition to gay marriage. \u201cHe\u2019s a paid contributor to Fox News who is publicly eyeing the 2016 presidential race with encouragement from the \u2018National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee,\u2019\u201d wrote Matt Finkelstein in The Daily Beast last month.\n\nCarson defended himself: \u201cI believe gay people should have all the rights anyone else has. I was trying to say that as far as marriage was concerned, it has traditionally been between a man and a woman and no one should be able to change that.\u201d Some believe, however, that Carson is simply too blunt to operate anywhere other than the political fringes as a writer and speaker.\n\nCarson says he\u2019ll speak up no matter what and that America must grow a backbone again. Too many in this country have been \u201crendered complacent by an overly generous system that cultivates their votes rather than their talents.\u201d People need people, he says \u2013 citing churches, community groups and others that can help \u201cachieve a growing and vital economy\u201d and give people \u201ca hand up rather than a handout.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question our government needs to cut wasteful spending,\u201d says Carson in the book. \u201cThe cutting should occur in areas of duplication of services, extravagant entertainment for government officials, fraud, unnecessary programs, and so on.\u201d But more vital, he says, is \u201cexpanding the economy with significant income to the government.\u201d Corporate tax rates should be reduced to create a friendlier environment for business and entrepreneurship.\n\nRelated: Why Republicans Need Rand Paul\u2019s Help With Iraq\n\nHere\u2019s Carson on the dangers of being on the dole for years on end, from his book:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t wish to sound cold, but sitting around collecting welfare checks is unlikely to bolster one\u2019s resume and expose one to job opportunities. When you make yourself valuable by acquiring knowledge and many skills, you make yourself more employable\u2026.\n\n\u201cOne logical and compassionate solution to the problem of growing welfare rolls is to set a date several years away for the elimination of welfare payments for able-bodied individuals who could work and support themselves. This would give them time to prepare for the job market\u2026 Some liberals would say that is mean and heartless, but some conservatives would say that continuing to sustain people in a dependent position with meager welfare payments is what is really cruel\u2026 It removes the incentive to engage in self-improvement activities.\u201d\n\nTo prove he\u2019s not just preaching, Carson, born poor in inner city Detroit, cites a range of menial jobs he\u2019s held in his own life. He says these jobs contributed to the sum total of his talents. He has worked as a lab assistant, a payroll office clerk, a bank teller, a mailroom clerk, an encyclopedia salesman, and a supervisor for a highway cleanup crew \u2013 even an assembly worker in an auto factory, all before becoming a renowned neurosurgeon who successfully separated conjoined twins.\n\n\u201cNo knowledge is wasted knowledge,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can be used in virtually any career, and opens many doors of opportunity.\u201d\n\nWhether Carson can ever make the leap, though, from bookish intellectual with deeply held conservative convictions to arms-wide-open political candidate who can lead a deeply divided Republican Party \u2013 let alone a nation -- that is the large and still very open question.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Get a job.", "title": "Get Off the Dole and Get a Job: Ben Carson", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/07/Get-Dole-and-Get-Job-Ben-Carson", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03182013_ben_carson_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/07/Get-Dole-and-Get-Job-Ben-Carson", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03182013_ben_carson_article.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Get a job.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "It can help save the U.S.A.That\u2019s one of the messages in conservative activist Ben Carson\u2019s new book, One Nation: What We Can Do to Save America\u2019s Future.\nWeed a garden, wash cars, pick vegetables \u2013 whatever you have to do to make a living and avoid being on the dole.\nA registered independent and devout Seventh Day Adventist Christian, Carson pole-vaulted to national prominence after he spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, D.C., in February 2013.\nCarson says he\u2019ll speak up no matter what and that America must grow a backbone again.\nCarson defended himself: \u201cI believe gay people should have all the rights anyone else has."}
