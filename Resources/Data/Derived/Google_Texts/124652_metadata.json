Greg Davids, R-Preston, says lawmakers continue to hear complaints about 1095-A forms that either haven\u2019t arrived or weren\u2019t accurate.\n\nDavids also wants to know if MNsure was one of six insurance exchanges that were the subject of a recent federal audit about tax credits being provided for people in exchange coverage who didn\u2019t qualify.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stunning that MNsure cannot even create and distribute a simple form,\u201d Davids wrote in a May 4 letter to MNsure Chief Executive Allison O\u2019Toole.\n\nMNsure spokesman Shane Delaney said all 1095-A forms were sent on or before April 2, and that the exchange in Minnesota has a correction rate of around 1 percent. That\u2019s far below the national average, Delaney said.\n\nMore broadly, Delaney said MNsure officials will provide Davids with the requested information.\n\nPeople who buy private health insurance through MNsure need a form 1095-A to reconcile tax credits they received last year with the amount of subsidy they qualified for. All of the tax forms were supposed to be sent by Feb. 1, but many were delayed as MNsure tried a new automated system for generating the documents.\n\nMinnesota launched the MNsure exchange to implement the federal Affordable Care Act, which requires almost all Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. Critics have seized on MNsure\u2019s technical problems and the growing cost of private coverage through the exchange, but supporters say the exchange has driven the historic decline in Minnesota\u2019s uninsured rate to 4.3 percent.\n\nBetween Nov. 1 and April 17, more than 90,000 state residents signed up for private health insurance through MNsure. During the time period, another 211,000 enrolled through the exchange in the state\u2019s public health insurance programs.\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "Tax day has passed, but the fighting over late tax forms from MNsure endures.", "title": "Republican lawmaker questions MNsure on tax forms", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/republican-lawmaker-questions-mnsure-on-tax-forms/378289161/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "Tax day has passed, but the fighting over late tax forms from MNsure endures.", "title": "Republican lawmaker questions MNsure on tax forms", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/republican-lawmaker-questions-mnsure-on-tax-forms/378289161/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Tax day has passed, but the fighting over late tax forms from MNsure endures."}, "article_summary": "Tax day has passed, but the fighting over late tax forms from MNsure endures.\nBetween Nov. 1 and April 17, more than 90,000 state residents signed up for private health insurance through MNsure.\nAll of the tax forms were supposed to be sent by Feb. 1, but many were delayed as MNsure tried a new automated system for generating the documents.\nMinnesota launched the MNsure exchange to implement the federal Affordable Care Act, which requires almost all Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty.\nPeople who buy private health insurance through MNsure need a form 1095-A to reconcile tax credits they received last year with the amount of subsidy they qualified for."}
