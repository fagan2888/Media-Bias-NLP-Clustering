The word has been bandied about so much that it is rapidly losing any real meaning.\n\nHere are 12 things beginning with the letter \u2018C\u2019 that somebody, somewhere has deemed racist.\n\nCarp \u2014 oily freshwater fish of the family Cyprinidae \u2014 are racist according to Minnesota state senator John Hoffman. In April, Hoffman introduced a bill to start calling \u201cAsian carp\u201d the completely offensive name \u201cinvasive carp.\u201d Hoffman complained that calling the fish \u201cAsian\u201d was insensitive, notes Breitbart.\n\nCrossing your arms is racist according to black comedian Aries Spears, who explained to digital cable channel TV One that large numbers of white people are racists. As evidence, he said according to Breitbart, many white people cross their arms when President Barack Obama is referenced.\n\nClimate change is racist according to Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison who, though he represents a district in frequently frigid Minnesota, managed to tweet in April: \u201cCommunities of color are more vulnerable to deaths from heat waves, which climate change will make worse #ActonClimate.\u201d The tweets in reply are hilarious, by the way.\n\nAfter country music singers Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley sang an acoustic ditty critical of Obamacare at the 2013 Country Music Awards, Twitter users took to their accounts to call the country music-loving audience a bunch of \u201crich white people who are racist and hate black people,\u201d according to Fox News.\n\nIn December 2013, the obscure leftist website called Salon ranted that Christianity is racist in an all all-over-the-place essay that lops in \u201cDuck Dynasty,\u201d Evangelicals\u2019 rejection of homosexuality and these darned kids today. \u201c[R]acism and colonization have also allowed white people, like Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, to create the Jesus they wish to see, too: a blonde, blue-eyed white man with long hair,\u201d the Salon writer fumes.\n\nBack in 2009, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) bizarrely suggested that colorblindness concerning race \u2014 \u201cthe idea that ignoring or overlooking racial and ethnic differences promotes racial harmony\u201d \u2014 is somehow itself racist. The SPLC is, of course, most famous because a man named Floyd Lee Corkins used an SPLC \u201cHate Map\u201d to find the Family Research Council headquarters in Washington, D.C. He entered the headquarters lobby in August 2012 in an attempt to \u201cto kill as many people as possible\u201d and \u201csmother Chick-fil-A sandwiches in their faces\u201d because he disagreed with the conservative organization about gay marriage. Corkins managed to shoot a security guard. The guard disarmed him.
