After speaking directly with Chad Henderson, The Washington Post has confirmed that he has not in fact enrolled in a health-care plan.\n\nChad Henderson is the media\u2019s poster boy for Obamacare. Reporters struggled this week to find individuals who said they had been able to enroll in one of the law\u2019s 36 federally run health-insurance exchanges.\n\nThat changed yesterday, when they found Henderson, a 21-year-old student and part-time child-care worker who lives in Georgia and says that he successfully enrolled himself and his father Bill in insurance plans via the online exchange administered at healthcare.gov.\n\nBut in an exclusive phone interview this morning with Reason, Chad's father Bill contradicted virtually every major detail of the story the media can't get enough of. What's more, some of the details that Chad has released are also at odds with published rate schedules and how Obamacare officials say the enrollment system works.\n\nThe coverage of Chad Henderson has been massive. He was featured in The Washington Post Thursday as \u201cthe Obamacare enrollee that tons of reporters are calling.\u201d He was also profiled in The Huffington Post as someone who \u201cbeat the glitches to sign up for Obamacare.\u201d He was interviewed by Politico, multiple local news organizations, and, according to his Facebook feed, was asked to be part of a conference call hosted by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nChad's story was tweeted out by the official Obamacare Twitter feed. It was promoted to the media by Enroll America, a health-care activist group headed by a former White House communications staffer, as a sign of Obamacare\u2019s success. Henderson told reporters at multiple news outlets that after a three-hour wait to sign up online, he enrolled around 3 a.m. Tuesday morning in an unsubsidized private insurance plan that would cost him about $175 a month. He also said that his father enrolled in separate coverage plan that would cost about $250 a month after factoring in the subsidies for which his father qualified on his approximately $24,000 annual income.\n\nChad\u2019s decision to purchase his own, separate plan might surprise some. A monthly premium of $175 would represent about 30 percent of his pre-tax take home pay\u2014about $583 a month on the $7,000 part-time income he claimed. And he could have chosen to be covered by his father\u2019s plan, which, under the Affordable Care Act, would have been required to cover dependents up to the age of 26. Chad said his father encouraged him to be covered under his own plan, even though the cost was higher. \"He's old school, so he wants me to take responsibility,\" Chad told The Huffington Post.\n\nHenderson\u2019s story was promoted as proof that the new health law can work for individuals. That was exactly how Chad intended it. He was a volunteer with President Obama\u2019s campaign last year, and his LinkedIn page still lists him as an active volunteer with Organizing for Action, the former campaign organization which now advocates for the president\u2019s legislative agenda.\n\nHe told The Washington Post that he was sharing his story because he wanted the new health law to succeed.\n\n\"I've read a few articles about how young people are very critical to the law's success,\" he said to The Post. \"I really just wanted to do my part to help out with the entire process.\"\n\nBut details of Chad's story proved difficult to verify. And in a phone interview conducted this morning, Chad\u2019s father Bill contradicted major details of Chad\u2019s story. I reached Bill Henderson by following a series of links at Chad's Facebook page, through which I was able to speak directly to the father.\n\nBill Henderson told me that both he and his son were interested in getting coverage, but that he had not enrolled in any plan yet, and to his knowledge, neither had his son. He also said that when they do enroll, getting the most coverage for the least money would be the goal, and that he expects that he and his son will get coverage under the same plan.\n\nBill told me that Chad had been looking into plans online. \u201cHe told me that there\u2019s different plans. And we haven\u2019t decided which plans to enroll in yet.\u201d\n\nI asked him whether he and his son had talked about going on separate plans, and he told me that, \u201cWe\u2019ll probably go on the same plan, more than likely.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he had seen specific plan options yet, Bill said, \u201cNo, we haven\u2019t looked over them that discrete yet. But it\u2019s just different plans that he [Chad] has told me we\u2019re going to go with. We\u2019ll have to choose one of them.\u201d\n\nBill told me that when he does enroll, his focus will be on getting value for money. \u201cWhatever gets the most coverage for the least price,\u201d is what Bill said he\u2019s looking for in a plan.\n\nBill also said he hoped he\u2019d qualify for subsidies through the health law. But he didn\u2019t know yet if he would. \u201cI\u2019m hoping so,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a possibility.\u201d As of yet, however, the pair had not picked a plan or completed enrollment. But he hoped they would shortly. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be enrolling, and looking at it, you know, looking over everything. So we\u2019re going to be deciding on what we\u2019re going to do very soon.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "An exclusive Reason.com interview with Bill Henderson.", "title": "UPDATED: Obamacare Poster Boy Chad Henderson and His Dad Didn't Really Buy Insurance", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2013/10/04/obamacare-chad-henderson-father", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2013_10/-chad-hendersonfacebook.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "UPDATED at 2.54pm ET: Scroll to end of this\narticle for the latest development in this story.
