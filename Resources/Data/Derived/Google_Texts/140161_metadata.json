U.S. officials have accused Russia of propping up Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and targeting U.S.-backed rebels in Syria with airstrikes, rather than seeking to eliminate the terrorist group.\n\n\u201cI have had several conversations with one of my Russian counterparts over the past several weeks about ways to strengthen U.S.-Russian counterterrorism cooperation, specifically on the ISIL threat,\u201d Brennan said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 global security forum.\n\nFollowing a series of attacks on Friday in Paris when Islamic State militants killed 129 people and wounded more than 300, France President Francois Hollande urged the United States and Russia to cast aside their disagreements and join in a combined alliance against the terrorist group. He said on Monday that he hoped to hold a meeting soon with President Obama and Putin.\n\n\u201cWe need a union of all who can fight this terrorist army in a single coalition,\u201d he said during a speech to a joint session of the French assembly at the Palace of Versailles.\n\nBrennan appeared to indicate that closer intelligence collaboration with the Russians is a serious possibility. He noted that more than 2,000 Russian nationals from areas in Central Asia, including the Caucuses, Chechnya, and Dagestan, have joined jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq, with some becoming senior Islamic State leaders.\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is be able to help Russia prevent the flow of terrorists inside of their territory that are maybe destined to try to carry out some terrorist attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve been exchanging information. I think it needs to be enhanced.\u201d\n\nA potential counterterrorism alliance involving the United States and Russia would mark a significant shift from the Obama administration\u2019s previous opposition to partnering with Moscow. Just last month, Defense Secretary Ash Carter said the United States was \u201cnot prepared to cooperate in a [Russian] strategy\u201d in Syria that is \u201ctragically flawed,\u201d a reference to Russian airstrikes that killed civilians and some rebel groups that received weapons through a CIA program.\n\nAdditionally, the administration has condemned Moscow for supporting Ukrainian separatists in a conflict that has claimed more than 8,000 lives since last April.\n\nMark Toner, State Department spokesman, said on Monday at a press briefing that U.S. officials have also urged their Russian counterparts to talk with Assad\u2019s government about no longer purchasing oil from the Islamic State. Though Assad claims to be fighting terrorists in his country\u2019s civil war, his regime is reported to have been a participant in the Islamic State\u2019s oil trade, a lucrative venture that enables the terrorist group to earn millions every year from seized oil fields.\n\n\u201cThis is something we\u2019ve raised with the Russians before because they have access to and can influence Assad,\u201d Toner said.\n\nThe State Department did not respond to a request for comment on the prospects of further U.S.-Russia collaboration against the Islamic State.\n\nAlso on Monday, Peter Cook, the Pentagon\u2019s press secretary, announced that the United States and France would expedite their intelligence sharing.\n\n\u201cSecretary of Defense Ash Carter and Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper have provided new instructions that will enable U.S. military personnel to more easily share operational planning information and intelligence with our French counterparts on a range of shared challenges to the fullest extent allowed by existing law and policy,\u201d Cook said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The Obama administration is considering ways to form a closer partnership with Russia against the Islamic State terrorist group, including intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation, in the wake of", "title": "Obama Administration Weighs Partnership with Russia Against Islamic State", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/obama-administration-weighs-partnership-with-russia-against-islamic-state/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Putin-Obama-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Obama administration is considering ways to form a closer partnership with Russia against the Is", "creator": "@TheWiserChoice", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Putin-Obama-150x150.jpg", "title": "Obama Administration Weighs Partnership with Russia Against Islamic State", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The State Department did not respond to a request for comment on the prospects of further U.S.-Russia collaboration against the Islamic State.\nBY: Follow @TheWiserChoiceThe Obama administration is considering ways to form a closer partnership with Russia against the Islamic State terrorist group, including intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation, in the wake of the Paris attacks, U.S. officials said on Monday.\nAlso on Monday, Peter Cook, the Pentagon\u2019s press secretary, announced that the United States and France would expedite their intelligence sharing.\nI think it needs to be enhanced.\u201dA potential counterterrorism alliance involving the United States and Russia would mark a significant shift from the Obama administration\u2019s previous opposition to partnering with Moscow.\nMark Toner, State Department spokesman, said on Monday at a press briefing that U.S. officials have also urged their Russian counterparts to talk with Assad\u2019s government about no longer purchasing oil from the Islamic State."}
