The Russian Federal Space Agency, Roscosmos is making plans to conduct a full-scale exploration of the moon. According to Roscosmos chief, Oleg Ostapenko, the agency is launching a new federal space program and work has started in preparation for the lunar missions.

Expeditions are tentatively scheduled to take place in the late 2020s to early 2030s following the results of lunar surface exploration by unmanned space probes. While they have a lot of work to do in preparation, Ostapenko says he feels confident that the agency will be able to follow through and implement their plans to explore the moon.
