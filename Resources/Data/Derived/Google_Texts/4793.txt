Raleigh police say a man faces multiple charges after a toddler shot themselves in the face with a gun.

Spokesman Jim Sughrue said 35-year-old Jamick Dakota Corley was charged Friday with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, possession of a firearm with an altered or obliterated serial number, failure to store a firearm safely to protect a minor and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

Corley is being held at the Wake County jail. It's not clear if he has an attorney.

Sughrue said officers responding to a call Friday found the child with a gunshot wound to the face. He said the child was taken to a Raleigh hospital before being transferred to Duke Hospital in Durham for what was termed as serious injuries.
