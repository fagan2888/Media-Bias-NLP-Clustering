Recent legislation has actually divided the GOP base, showing that they are not as united as the midterm elections might have projected.\n\nThe New York Times explained that the divide in the new Congress arguably started when 12 Republicans voted against two-time Speaker of the House John Boehner. After winning a third term, Boehner subsequently punished two defectors by kicking them off the rules committee.\n\nThen, after filing legislation to defund the Department of Homeland Security in response to President Obama\u2019s immigration order, House Republicans could not unify to end the legal recognition of child immigrants who entered the country illegally.\n\nThis week, Republicans decided to file an abortion bill that would enact a ban on abortions past 20 weeks. However, Republican Congresswomen objected to the legislation, forcing GOP leaders to propose another abortion bill that would limit federal funding for abortions.\n\nRep. Charlie Dent, a Republican from Pennsylvania, summed up the divide within the Republican party perfectly.\n\n\u201cWeek one, we had the vote for the speaker. Week two, we debated deporting children. Week three, we\u2019re debating rape and incest,\u201d he said. \u201cI just can\u2019t wait for week four.\u201d\n\nThat is not to mention the Affordable Care Act. The Hill reports that Republicans have been under enormous pressure to undo the heath care law, but don\u2019t know how. Some still want to repeal the law all together. Others call to eliminate certain provisions, including the 30-hour work week.\n\nReal Clear Politics thinks the divide might rest in the freshman lawmakers who were just voted in to office last November. Analysis from the Brookings Institute shows that 40 percent of new Republicans come from districts that either Obama won in 2012 or Romney won by fewer than five points. They label these lawmakers as \u201cObama Republicans.\u201d\n\nWhile the results found that \u201cObama Republicans\u201d and the rest of the party are united on tax policy, they are deeply divided on social issues. The charts below show that the freshman Obama Republicans have been much more silent on gun control, abortion and same-sex marriage than their Republican counterparts.\n\nEven with a clear divide in their party, the Republicans are going to have to find a way to govern the nation. A few weeks into the new Congress, aside from the Keystone XL pipeline, Republicans have seen their agenda divide even their own ranks. Until Boehner gets his entire base in line, the problems will continue.\n\nSources: Real Clear Politics, New York Times, The Hill / Photo Credit: Florida News Journal, Real Clear Politics", "article_metadata": {"theme-version": "1.2.4", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0", "description": "Now that the Republicans have a majority in both the House and the Senate, they will stand united and govern t...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "Congressional Republicans Stand Divided On Own Agenda", "modernizr-version": "2.8.3", "foundation-version": "5.4.7", "msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "og": {"url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/politics/congressional-republicans-not-unified-own-agenda", "image": "http://www.opposingviews.com/", "type": "article", "description": "Now that the Republicans have a majority in both the House and the Senate, they will stand united and govern t...", "title": "Congressional Republicans Stand Divided On Own Agenda"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-01-26T03:52:58+00:00", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "publish_date": "2015-01-26T03:52:58+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/ov_foundation/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "ov": {"id": 842834}, "theme-color": "#0e0e0e"}, "article_summary": "Sources: Real Clear Politics, New York Times, The Hill / Photo Credit: Florida News Journal, Real Clear Politics\nThis week, Republicans decided to file an abortion bill that would enact a ban on abortions past 20 weeks.\nEven with a clear divide in their party, the Republicans are going to have to find a way to govern the nation.\nNow that the Republicans have a majority in both the House and the Senate, they will stand united and govern the nation under a steady, conservative agenda, right?\nThe charts below show that the freshman Obama Republicans have been much more silent on gun control, abortion and same-sex marriage than their Republican counterparts."}
