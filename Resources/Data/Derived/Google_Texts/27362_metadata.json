Only one person answered all the questions in the quiz correctly. And nearly all of those who took the survey held at least one powerful misperception about Social Security. Misperceptions are costly\u2014and could potentially cost you or a loved thousands of dollars. Don\u2019t overlook these nine money-boosting facts:\n\nRelated: 6 Popular Social Security Myths Busted\n\nYour full or normal retirement age to receive full Social Security benefits depends on your birth year. (Hint: It may not be 65.) For example, for people born between 1943 and 1954, the full retirement age is 66. For those born in 1960 or later, the full retirement age is 67.\n\nIt pays to wait. Delay starting your benefits after age 62, but don\u2019t wait until you\u2019re past 70. If you can wait, your benefit increases and you become eligible for delayed retirement credits, which can increase your monthly benefit by 8 percent for each year you delay collecting, up to a maximum of 32 percent. Over your lifetime, this could add thousands of dollars. Once you reach the age of 70, no additional delayed retirement credits accrue.\n\nYou can still work and earn a paycheck\u2014and collect Social Security benefits, but it won\u2019t be for the full amount if you\u2019re below your normal retirement age (NRA). If you\u2019re below the NRA, you will be subject to an earnings test. Remember: for every $2 of self-employment income or wages over $15,720 per year, your Social Security income is reduced by $1.\n\nRelated: Democrats Call for Major Change in Social Security\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be an American citizen in order to receive Social Security retirement benefits. Resident aliens who pay into the Social Security system may qualify for retirement benefits if they meet the criteria, such as legal alien status, a Social Security number, and permission by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to work in the U.S.\n\nIf you are married and your spouse dies, you will only get one Social Security income\u2014not both--whichever one is higher.\n\nSocial Security income\u2014not both--whichever one is higher. Your benefits are based on a 35-year average of your covered wages. If you\u2019ve worked for less than 35 years, the Social Security benefit formula will enter \u201czero\u201d for each year you didn\u2019t work into your 35-year average. If you have more than 35 years of earnings, Social Security will pick the highest 35 years to give you the highest average earnings amount. To remove those \u201czero\u201d or lower-earning years from the average, you\u2019ll have to keep working.\n\nRelated: $20 Million Payout to Nazis: Just One More Social Security Screw-Up\n\nPay attention to who is eligible to receive benefits in your household. Spouses can qualify for Social Security benefits, even without individual earnings history of their own. It also can be fiscally advantageous to coordinate benefits for spouses, so they are not starting Social Security payments at the same time. Dependent children or grandchildren under the age of 18, and those who have become mentally or physically disabled before age 22, also may receive an additional benefit. And this holds true whether they are biological, adopted, or stepchildren.\n\nIf you\u2019re divorced, you may be able to receive retirement benefits from your ex-spouse if you meet certain conditions, such as the marriage lasting for at least 10 years.\n\nIf you\u2019re a freelancer, don\u2019t shortchange yourself by under-reporting your taxable income. You don\u2019t want to hit your retirement years with little or no savings, and extremely reduced Social Security benefits.\n\nFor more information on Social Security benefits and retirement, go to the Social Security Administration website.
