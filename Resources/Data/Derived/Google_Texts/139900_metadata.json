It has subpoenaed information relating to the 23 nonprofit co-op insurance companies that ObamaCare established with $2.5 billion in government loans.\n\nThe co-ops were supposed to provide price competition against commercial insurers, but last year many pushed for and got huge, double-digit rate hikes. Even so, more than half of the 23 set up have failed already, and it\u2019s likely that eight more will collapse this year.\n\nGiven that taxpayers are on the hook for billions in loans that might never get repaid, it is only fitting that Congress should find out what went wrong and why.\n\nBut instead of providing answers, the Obama administration is stonewalling.\n\nOversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz said at a hearing this week, \u201cHealth and Human Services has not provided any valid legal reason for withholding information from this committee.\u201d\n\nThe committee demanded documents back in November that would shed light on how the administration picked these co-ops, how much money has been spent and what plans the administration has to get federal loan money back from failed co-ops.\n\nChaffetz says that Obama officials merely \u201cassert that if certain information was released publicly, it could cause consumers to think twice before enrolling in co-op insurance plans.\u201d\n\nThat makes absolutely no sense. If other co-ops are likely to fail, then consumers should be aware of it, so they can avoid having their coverage disrupted midyear, which could mean changing doctors, paying higher out-of-pocket costs and so on.\n\nThis is hardly the first time that the administration has stonewalled congressional inquiries. If anything, it seems to be the unstated policy of the Obama administration.\n\nIn addition to the ObamaCare documents, for example, the Oversight Committee is battling to get documents related to the EPA\u2019s massively expensive water regulations, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s policy on airport credentialing, the massive hack of government employee records and so on.\n\nObama officials get away with concealing anything and everything that might prove embarrassing or controversial because the \u201cspeaking truth to power\u201d mainstream press largely ignores the stonewalling. So the White House doesn\u2019t suffer any consequences or feel any pressure to change.\n\nYou can bet the media\u2019s lackadaisical attitude about government transparency will suddenly change if a Republican ends up in the White House next year. But in the meantime, we may never get a clear answer to why the Obama administration flushed $2.5 billion in taxpayer money down the drain.", "article_metadata": {"date": "2016-04-21 14:14:47:-08:00", "description": "Being the \u201cmost transparent administration\u201d in history doesn\u2019t mean complying with a congressional subpoena to find out why ObamaCare co-ops have failed.", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Being the \u201cmost transparent administration\u201d in history apparently doesn\u2019t mean\u00a0complying with a congressional subpoena to find out why more than half of the ObamaCare co-ops have failed.
