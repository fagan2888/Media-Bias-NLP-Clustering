The first International Special Olympics was held in 1968 in Chicago, thanks to the work of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, in order to highlight the talents and abilities of those with intellectual or physical disabilities.

Forty-seven years later, the Special Olympics boasts 6,500 athletes hailing from 165 countries to compete in numerous sports and events. This year, there were athletic competitions for 25 different sports, including equestrian, bowling, bocce ball and weightlifting.

An estimated 500,000 people came out to show their support and watch the competition in Los Angeles, leading its organizers to believe that it will be the largest sports and humanitarian event in the world this year.

These are some scenes from the inspirational athletes and supporters at the 2015 Special Olympics World Games.
