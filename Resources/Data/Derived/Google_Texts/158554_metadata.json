Writes Rasmussen Reports, \u201cA new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 33% of Likely U.S. Voters now believe that states should have the right to ignore federal court rulings if their elected officials [dis]agree with them. That\u2019s up nine points from 24% when we first asked this question in February. Just over half (52%) disagree, down from 58% in the earlier survey. Fifteen percent (15%) are undecided.\u201d\n\nThis shift is clearly influenced not just by Obergefell v. Hodges (the marriage ruling), but also a late June ObamaCare decision so contrary to the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u2019s\u201d text that Justice Scalia lamented to the Court, \u201cWords no longer have meaning.\u201d Not surprisingly, there was an ideological divide among poll respondents. As Rasmussen also tells us, \u201cFifty percent (50%) of GOP voters now believe states should have the right to ignore federal court rulings, compared to just 22% of Democrats and 30% of voters not affiliated with either major party. Interestingly, this represents a noticeable rise in support among all three groups. Fifty percent (50%) of conservative voters share this view, but just 27% of moderates and 15% of liberals agree.\u201d\n\nAlso not surprisingly, this pattern basically reverses itself when voters are asked if Barack Obama should be able to ignore the courts when he wants to. As Rasmussen wrote in February after surveying voters on that question, \u201c43% of Democrats believe the president should have the right to ignore the courts. Only 35% of voters in President Obama\u2019s party disagree, compared to 81% of Republicans and 67% of voters not affiliated with either major party.\u201d\n\nAs to the recent poll, Rasmussen writes that Republicans and conservatives being most likely to support state defiance of federal courts is perhaps \u201cdisturbing\u201d because those groups \u201ctraditionally have been the most supportive of the Constitution and separation of powers.\u201d But the reality is that these responses \u2014 conservatives advocating defiance of liberal courts, liberals advocating defiance for a liberal man, and Rasmussen indicating that the judiciary should have ultimate-arbiter power \u2014 reflect emotional reactions more than constitutional analysis.\n\nFirst note that this gratuitous judicial-review power \u2014 where courts\u2019 rulings on law are considered to constrain all three branches of government \u2014 is not found in the Constitution. Rather, it was unilaterally declared by the Court itself in the 1803 Marbury v. Madison decision. In other words, Rasmussen\u2019s supposition about the courts\u2019 role does not align with constitutionalism.\n\nBut critics would say that this is putting it lightly. Justice Scalia wrote in his Obergefell dissent that the Court has actually become \u201ca threat to American democracy.\u201d And this just reflects what founder Thomas Jefferson warned when he said that if the Court was not reminded of its impotence, if it comes to be viewed as having ultimate-arbiter (judicial review) power, our Constitution will have become \u201ca suicide pact.\u201d As I wrote just last week:\n\nJefferson explained the problem with judicial review, writing, \u201cFor intending to establish three departments, co-ordinate and independent, that they might check and balance one another, it has given, according to this [judicial review] opinion, to one of them alone, the right to prescribe rules for the government of the others, and to that one too, which is unelected by, and independent of the nation.... The constitution, on this hypothesis, is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary, which they may twist, and shape into any form they please.\u201d\n\nJefferson also pointed out, correctly, that \u201cOur judges are as honest as other men and not more so. They have with others the same passions for party, for power, and the privilege of their corps.\u201d \u2026Judicial review is \u201ca very dangerous doctrine indeed,\u201d Jefferson warned in 1820, \u201cand one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy.\u201d\n\nJefferson also wrote that nullification \u2014 states\u2019 ignoring of federal dictates \u2014 is the \u201crightful remedy\u201d for all central-government usurpation of states\u2019 powers. Of course, this includes plainly unconstitutional rulings by oligarchic federal courts.\n\nThus, the 50 percent of GOP voters polled this week are right \u2014 although perhaps without realizing that their position is constitutionally sound. States have recourse to the \u201crightful remedy\u201d of nullification because the Constitution reserves most powers to the states, and the states are not bound to follow unconstitutional federal edicts. In fact, in order to adhere to the Constitution, states are duty bound not to enforce such edicts, but to declare them null and void at the state border.\n\nOf course, this balance of power ensures a tug of war and some gridlock in government, but that\u2019s how the state is kept small and freedoms big. If we want issues settled cleanly and quickly with the stroke of a pen, we can appoint a dictator.\n\nOr an oligarchy \u2014 sort of like the Supreme Court has become.\n\nIf the Court is not frequently reminded of its impotence, the people will ever be reminded of theirs.\n\nRelated article:\n\nSupreme Court Rubber Stamps Same-sex \u201cMarriage\u201d \u2014 Time for Nullification", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Supreme Court, marriage, nullification, Rasmussen, poll", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/constitution/item/21190-pound-sand-your-honor-more-americans-want-states-to-ignore-federal-courts", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/82784fbb44a7534098145dfa03aeb603_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "With the federal courts increasingly overstepping their constitutional bounds, support for nullification is growing.
