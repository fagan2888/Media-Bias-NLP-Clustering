Her latest book, \u201cLet\u2019s Be Less Stupid,\u201d publishes next summer.\n\nShe says she reads the paper on her computer late at night.\n\n\u201cI know it is very unfashionable to dislike paper,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I could never get the hang of folding The Times (it always looked as if I was trying to make a hat for a children\u2019s birthday party).\n\n\u201cAlso, who has time to look for the continuation of the story on Page A16?\u201d\n\nQ.\n\nDoes the late-night, online way you read the paper affect what you read?\n\nA.\n\nMy approach has made me fairly malnourished, news-wise, in the same way that someone who eats only at buffets tends to concentrate on dessert.\n\nAlso, it means that I am never sure when anything happened. Often, I know about a development in a story or about the death of a famous person hours before the news is printed in the morning paper. It\u2019s like being a visitor from the future.\n\nOn the other hand, I sometimes read old news without knowing it was written weeks ago, so I have to be careful not to say things like, \u201cHey, can you believe the Visigoths sacked Rome?!\u201d\n\n\n\nQ.\n\nAre there kinds of articles that you always read or that you reliably don\u2019t?\n\nA.\n\nWhen a story breaks in the news \u2014 say, a junta seizes power in a country you can\u2019t find on a map \u2014 you have to make a snap decision about whether it will have legs or whether you will never see a report on that subject again.\n\nIf it is a story that will become major, you must get in on the ground floor, or otherwise there will be too many political factions and similar sounding names and you will never catch up enough to know what\u2019s going on.\n\nIt\u2019s like buying stock in a current event \u2014 you want something that\u2019s going to pay off in the long term. Decades ago, I made a bad judgment call about the crisis in the Mideast, thinking it would blow over in a few days, and consequently, I\u2019ve never been straight about, for instance, Hamas versus Hezbollah versus P.L.O. versus Fatah. You can ask me anything about the Symbionese Liberation Army or the Y2K problem, though.\n\nThere was a small not-much-to-it article this week about education in Nepal. I read every word, and now, if things go well for Nepal (which is to say not well), I am poised to become a pundit on Katmandu.\n\nQ.\n\nAnd are there kinds of articles you are happy to skip?\n\nA.\n\nThere are some articles I really appreciate because I don\u2019t feel guilty about skipping them. \u201cHow to Cook a Thanksgiving Dinner\u201d was an example this week. Ditto the entire sports section except for occasional baseball news. Ditto weather events, such as record-breaking cold waves, that take over the headlines, giving me a news holiday.\n\nNowadays, so much of what I read I forget the next day. In order to minimize this kind of brain spillage, I have developed a strategy for reading a hard news story that involves figuring out when the article has moved on to details I\u2019ll never remember and stopping there.\n\nQ.\n\nEditorials. Do you read them? Do they ever change your mind?\n\nA.\n\nI am a knee-jerk liberal and I want to stay that way no matter how compelling the argument on the other side is. I also have a habit of agreeing with whatever I read last. Therefore, I avoid editorials written by conservative columnists. The libertarians often make some good points and many of them write articulately and persuasively, so I never read anything by them. I basically stick with Krugman, Bruni and Dowd.\n\nQ.\n\nObits. Do you read them with special interest?\n\nA.\n\nEveryone I know likes obituaries, and I\u2019m no different. I feel, though, that Paragraph No. 2, the one that contains the cause of death, should be expanded. I am sure I am not the only one who wants to know the first symptom of the deadly disease. Also, if you could include the deceased\u2019s last words, that would be helpful.\n\nQ.\n\nIs The Times a good source of material for a humor writer (you)?\n\nA.\n\nI am always on the lookout for stories with comedy potential. Unfortunately, so is every other humorist. This week it was disclosed that yet another former Navy SEAL claimed credit for firing the shot that killed Osama. I barely read that item because I knew Andy Borowitz, who writes a hilarious humor column for The New Yorker, would deal with it (as would late-night talk show hosts, who are also funnier than I am). I couldn\u2019t resist reading the amusing and intriguing squib, however, about the invention of a color that is the blackest black. It is called Vantablack. Doesn\u2019t that sound like the opposite of Vanna White?\n\nQ.\n\nAny good news in the paper this week?\n\nA.\n\nThis was a good week for fortuitous accidents, which made me happy because I am careless and I like to think something good might result. There was an obituary of the guy who invented CorningWare not on purpose and also a letter to the editor attributing the fall of the Berlin Wall to blunders made by Eastern European politicians.\n\nOn the other hand, Paul Krugman says that Obamacare might be felled by a typo in a clause of the Affordable Care Act. This makes me think that if they don\u2019t make auto-correct illegal (or should I say: \u201cRoom swallows next cone dip photocopier eject the paint penis\u201d), there might not be any laws left. Of course, they\u2019d probably end up banning automobiles instead, which would be O.K. with me.\n\nQ.\n\nLast word?\n\nA.\n\nThe story I most wish I\u2019d read when I was in college was the one reporting that New York City police will soon no longer arrest you for possessing a small amount of marijuana. This is like hearing from your parents long after you\u2019ve moved away from home that you no longer have a curfew.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20141112133003, "twitter": {"description": "The staff writer for The New Yorker \u2014 and author whose latest book, \u201cLet\u2019s Be Less Stupid,\u201d publishes this summer \u2014 says she reads the paper on her computer late at night.", "title": "Reading The Times With Patricia Marx", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/11/12/reading-the-times-with-patricia-marx/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/11/12/blogs/patty/patty-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytimes", "card": "summary"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000003231091, "CLMST": "Susan Lehman", "org": "New York Times", "keywords": "Marx Patricia,News and News Media,New York Times,Highlights,Uncategorized", "GBLC": "Highlights", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/times-insider/Reading The Times With Patricia Marx ( 20141112 )", "description": "The staff writer for The New Yorker \u2014 and author whose latest book, \u201cLet\u2019s Be Less Stupid,\u201d publishes this summer \u2014 says she reads the paper on her computer late at night.", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Susan Lehman", "SCG": "times-insider", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "timesinsider", "per": "Marx, Patricia", "byl": "Susan Lehman", "BN": "times-insider", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/times-insider/post", "news_keywords": "New York Times,News media,Patricia Marx", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "November 12, 2014", "article": {"tag": "Uncategorized", "published_time": 1415817003, "modified_time": "2014-11-13T19:19:47-05:00", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts//index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20141113191947, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20141112, "pdate": 20141112, "des": "News and News Media", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/11/12/blogs/patty/patty-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/11/12/reading-the-times-with-patricia-marx/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/11/12/blogs/patty/patty-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The staff writer for The New Yorker \u2014 and author whose latest book, \u201cLet\u2019s Be Less Stupid,\u201d publishes this summer \u2014 says she reads the paper on her computer late at night.", "title": "Reading The Times With Patricia Marx"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/11/12/reading-the-times-with-patricia-marx/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Reading The Times With Patricia Marx", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/11/12/blogs/patty/patty-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 12, 2014"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ad3\"", "article_summary": "This was a good week for fortuitous accidents, which made me happy because I am careless and I like to think something good might result.\nDoes the late-night, online way you read the paper affect what you read?\nI couldn\u2019t resist reading the amusing and intriguing squib, however, about the invention of a color that is the blackest black.\nPhotoPatricia Marx is a staff writer for The New Yorker and an author.\nIs The Times a good source of material for a humor writer (you)?"}
