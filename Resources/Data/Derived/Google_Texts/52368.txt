Ohio Gov. John Kasich says he will not run as a third-party candidate, The Hill reports. "I think that I gave it my best where I am, and I just think running third-party doesn't feel right," Kasich told CNN in an interview set to air Monday night. "I think it's not constructive."Kasich said he talked to someone by phone who urged him to run third-party after dropping out of the GOP race earlier this spring. Kasich would not say who talked to him, but a Washington Post report last week said 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney is leading an effort to get a third-party candidate to run against GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump.Romney and others on the right believe Trump is not conservative enough and are pushing for a third-party alternative. Other Republicans warn that such a move would only divide the conservative vote and elect Democrat Hillary Clinton.
