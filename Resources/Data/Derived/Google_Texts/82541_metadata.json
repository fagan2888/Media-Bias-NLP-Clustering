We at the Campaign for America's Future are proud to have played a leadership role in helping to write the letter. And thank the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and all the other groups who worked to forge a consensus on the statement and helped to get the attention of Congress in this important moment of real danger for our economy.\n\nPrinciples for Debate on the Budget and the Economy\n\nDear Member of Congress:\n\nAs we head into another series of manufactured budget crises, the 41 undersigned organizations stand against those who want to hold our economy hostage in order to dictate the terms of debate. We urge you to:\n\nEnd Job-Killing Sequestration Cuts\n\nThe greatest challenge facing our economy today is the continuing jobs crisis, not the deficit. Over 20 million people are in need of full-time work. Meanwhile, the annual deficit has been cut by more than half since 2009 as a portion of the economy, and is now falling faster than at any time since the demobilization after World War II.\n\nThe across-the-board budget cuts -- called \"sequestration\" -- that began in March of this year are making the jobs crisis worse and holding back economic growth. According to the Congressional Budget Office, simply repealing sequestration would generate 900,000 jobs. We call on Congress to end the sequester -- period -- and not replace it with other harmful cuts.\n\nWe reject threats by some extremists to shut down the government or cause a government default unless their ransom demands are met -- including their demand to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Congress should lift the debt ceiling without conditions because the full faith and credit of the U.S. government is not -- and should not be -- negotiable.\n\nProtect Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security\n\nWe urge you to oppose any cuts in Social Security, Medicaid or Medicare benefits, including the shifting of health care costs to beneficiaries. We should be improving Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare by expanding benefits, not cutting them, because working people need more economic security, not less.\n\nDefend Core Programs for Those Most At Risk\n\nCongress should defend the core security programs for those most at risk in this economy, such as impoverished women and children, the elderly, or the long-term unemployed. The savage cuts proposed for food stamps (SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Program) are unconscionable. Cuts now projected in education, housing, home heating, Head Start, infant nutrition and other programs vital to low-income families should be reversed.\n\nEliminate All Tax Incentives for Sending Jobs Overseas\n\nPowerful corporations and the rich should pay their fair share of taxes. As a start, we call on Congress to eliminate all tax incentives that encourage companies to ship jobs abroad. Ending these tax subsidies would -- by itself -- increase investment and employment in the U.S. At the same time, it would generate hundreds of billions in revenue which could help rebuild our economy without increasing the deficit. This money could be used to launch a five-year plan to rebuild our outmoded infrastructure; to help ensure that the U.S. captures the lead in a green industrial revolution that is already generating growing numbers of good jobs; and to invest in education, from preschool to affordable college, to prepare our children to succeed in the 21st century. Congress should combine this with raising the minimum wage and reviving the right to organize to counter the extreme inequality so debilitating to our economy.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAFL-CIO\n\nAIDS United\n\nAmerican Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME)\n\nAmerican Federation of Teachers\n\nCampaign for America's Future\n\nCaring Across Generations\n\nCenter for Community Change\n\nCenter for Effective Government\n\nCoalition on Human Needs\n\nCommunications Workers of America\n\nCommunity Action Partnership\n\nCouncil for Opportunity in Education\n\nCourageCampaign.org\n\nDisability Rights Education & Defense Fund\n\nFair Share\n\nGamaliel\n\nGreen For All\n\nHealth Care for America Now\n\nInternational Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW)\n\nJobs with Justice/American Rights at Work\n\nLeadership Center for the Common Good\n\nThe Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights\n\nMoveOn.org Civic Action\n\nNAACP\n\nNational Coalition for the Homeless\n\nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare\n\nNational Employment Law Project\n\nNational Fair Housing Alliance\n\nNational Immigration Law Center\n\nNational People's Action\n\nNational Women's Law Center\n\nNETWORK, A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby\n\nPartnership for Working Families\n\nPolicyLink\n\nRacial and Ethnic Health Disparities Coalition\n\nService Employees International Union (SEIU)\n\nSocial Security Works\n\nUnited Steelworkers (USW)\n\nUSAction\n\nWider Opportunities for Women\n\nWorking America\n\nFollow Roger Hickey on Twitter: www.twitter.com/rogerhickey", "article_metadata": {"description": "Forty-one organizations, representing millions of Americans, have signed this letter to Congress, asking them to stand against those who would \"hold our ...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2013-09-29 13:30:42 -0400", "og": {"url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/roger-hickey/41-citizen-groups-tell-co_b_4009252.html", "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Forty-one organizations, representing millions of Americans, have signed this letter to Congress, asking them to stand against those who would \"hold our ...", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "height": 1000}, "creator": "rogerhickey", "description": "Forty-one organizations, representing millions of Americans, have signed this letter to Congress, asking them to stand against those who would \"hold our ...", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostPol"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-28 13:30:42 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=4009252", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "jobs,congress,hostages,Debt Ceiling,sequestration,austerity", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "jobs,congress,hostages,Debt Ceiling,sequestration,austerity", "published_time": "2013-09-28 13:30:42 -0400", "modified_time": "2013-11-28 05:12:01 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff28\"", "article_summary": "We should be improving Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare by expanding benefits, not cutting them, because working people need more economic security, not less.\nThe across-the-board budget cuts -- called \"sequestration\" -- that began in March of this year are making the jobs crisis worse and holding back economic growth.\nWe urge you to:End Job-Killing Sequestration CutsThe greatest challenge facing our economy today is the continuing jobs crisis, not the deficit.\nProtect Medicare, Medicaid and Social SecurityWe urge you to oppose any cuts in Social Security, Medicaid or Medicare benefits, including the shifting of health care costs to beneficiaries.\nAs a start, we call on Congress to eliminate all tax incentives that encourage companies to ship jobs abroad."}
