Exit polls cited by MSNBC said that three in four S.C. voters are evangelical but they did not vote in a bloc for the most overtly evangelical candidate. Many preferred Trump\u2019s tough talk on terrorism, top issue in the primary according an Associated Press poll.\n\nIn the days leading up to the South Carolina vote on Saturday (Feb. 20) there was a go-round between Donald Trump and Pope Francis over whether Trumps\u2019 views of migrants are \u201cChristian.\u201d (Both soft-peddled the exchange within 24 hours).\n\nAnd while Sen.Ted Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio brawled to a virtual tie for second place in South Carolina, former Fla. governor Jeb Bush lowered the flag. Bush came to the podium Saturday night and conceded not only the election but the race as well \u201cto my competitors who remain on the island.\u201d\n\nHere are 5 faith facts about the two states where there are still votes to come later this week. Democrats in South Carolina vote on Saturday, Feb. 27. Republicans in Nevada choose their candidate on Feb. 23. (Follow the 5 Faith Facts series as the race runs through this contentious primary season.)\n\n1. Evangelicals still matter in South Carolina.\n\nAlthough the religious mix in the state is changing, the faith vote is significant. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an irreligious Jew, bowed his head while attending a prayer breakfast organized by African-American faith leaders in Columbia, S.C., on Tuesday (Feb. 16).\n\nThe share of South Carolinians who identify as white and Christian dropped 16 percentage points, to 50 percent, between 2007 and 2015, according to Public Religion Research Institute.\n\nWhite evangelical Protestants \u2014 the group that was expected to favor son-of-a-pastor Sen. Ted Cruz \u2014 took the strongest hit, declining 10 percentage points. Still, at 26 percent in 2015, this remains the largest single grouping based on religious self-identification.\n\nRELATED STORY: Christians lose ground, \u2018nones\u2019 soar in new portrait of US religion\n\nWhite mainline Protestants (like Donald Trump, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton) are now at 16 percent, down from 22 percent in 2007.\n\nOnly one group has held steady in eight years. White Catholics (like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush) make up 6 percent of South Carolina voters. Hispanic Catholics (like Sen. Marco Rubio) rose slightly, reaching 3 percent in the same time period.\n\nTwo groups that have traditionally been sources of strength for Democrats have shown increases.\n\nBlack Protestants (Ben Carson, a Seventh-day Adventist, may be an exception to the leaning-left majority) are now the state\u2019s second-largest religious group at 19 percent, up slightly from 17 percent in 2007. And South Carolina has a significant number of \u201cnones\u201d \u2014 people who claim no religious identity. They\u2019re now 17 percent, up from 10 percent in 2007, according to PRRI.\n\n2. In Nevada, nones matter more.\n\nPeople with no religious identity, the so-called nones, make up a whopping 30 percent of Nevada residents, up from 22 percent in 2007, according to PRRI. And many in this group, including many Millennials, warmed to Sanders. He also drew well among Hispanic voters. However, Clinton\u2019s appeal to women, African-Americans, and older voters, all known to be more religious, nudged her to the winners column.\n\nWhite mainline Protestants are only 13 percent in Nevada.\n\nMeanwhile, evangelicals remain at 10 percent, unchanged in eight years. Catholics also held steady, at 12 percent, between the 2007 race and the 2015 start of the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe two groups showing the biggest declines in religious market share were Mormons (down to 6 percent from 11 percent) and Hispanic Catholics (down to 9 percent from 13 percent.)\n\n3. Religion continues to impact issues in the news.\n\nConsider the hubbub over whether President Obama should nominate a replacement for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died suddenly on Feb. 13. It was a hot topic at the GOP debate hours after Scalia\u2019s death was announced.\n\nObama says he\u2019ll put forward a name. Both Democrats say he should do so, but the GOP candidates uniformly say they don\u2019t want anyone nominated or confirmed until after a new president is sworn in.\n\nThe candidates\u2019 response to any prospective justice may be shaped by the nominee\u2019s religion as well as his or her political ideology and legal views. And candidates\u2019 own religious beliefs might influence their preferences \u2014 or objections \u2014 to a nominee. Evangelical Christians, for example, may favor a justice who interprets the Constitution strictly by its word-for-word meaning, just as they take the Bible literally rather than viewing the text in the context of contemporary times.\n\nRELATED STORY: Sri Srinivasan: The first Hindu on the Supreme Court?\n\nThere are no Protestants on the high court now. Scalia was Catholic, as are five other justices (the remaining three are Jewish). How important is it to reflect the nation where Protestants, while shrinking in numbers, are still a dominant force in the culture? Look for the issue to begin shaping the dynamics of the presidential primaries.\n\n4. In the end, there\u2019s (almost) always mention of God \u2014 or not.\n\nExpect victory \u2014 or concession \u2014 speeches in South Carolina and Nevada to have tweet-able mentions of the Almighty. After New Hampshire, Trump said this:\n\n.@realDonaldTrump on #NHPrimary win:\n\n\u201cI am going to be the greatest jobs president that God ever created \u2014 remember that.\u201d \u2014 Religion NewsService (@RNS) February 10, 2016\n\nClinton, in her New Hampshire concession speech, went with a more traditional reaction:\n\n.@HillaryClinton #NHPrimary: Faith, family taught me credo: \u201cDo all the good you can in all the ways you can for all the people you can.\u201d \u2014 Religion NewsService (@RNS) February 10, 2016\n\nBut not all references after the Granite State primary were overtly religious. Sanders left out God but still made a moral plea in his victory speech:\n\n.@BernieSanders: \u201cWe have a moral responsibility\u201d to work with countries to move away from fossil fuels to sustainable energy. #NHPrimary \u2014 Religion NewsService (@RNS) February 10, 2016\n\nREAD: Who would Jesus vote for? Maybe Bernie (COMMENTARY)\n\n5. Super Tuesday could change it all.\n\nNational religious trends will matter more when 14 primaries or caucuses are held March 1 for one or both parties.\n\nFolks will choose their candidates in states from the Bible Belt to one of the nation\u2019s least religious states, Sanders\u2019 home base of Vermont. (Voting opens March 1 through 8 for Democrats living abroad.)\n\nAnd this is just the start of America\u2019s political version of basketball\u2019s March Madness \u2014 there will be more than two dozen more primaries and caucuses before April.\n\nThis is when the relative clout of conservative Christians \u2014 evangelical or Catholic \u2014 will be matched up with the rising power of the nones, whose values are not tethered to any particular theology or religious institutions.\n\n(Cathy Lynn Grossman is a senior national correspondent for RNS)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Politics, 2016 election, Ben Carson, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump, evangelical, Hillary Clinton, Jeb Bush, John Kasich", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "(RNS) S.C. evangelicals divided votes among tough-on-terror Trump, son-of-a-pastor Cruz, and Catholic Rubio.
