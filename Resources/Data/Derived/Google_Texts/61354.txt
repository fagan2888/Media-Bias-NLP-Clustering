AutoFair CEO named Dealer of the Year



MANCHESTER — AutoFair president and CEO Andy Crews is bringing back top honors from the National Automobile Dealers Association Convention and Exposition.



Crews is the winner of TIME National Dealer of the Year award.

..

“It’s a huge honor,” Crews said Sunday in a call from the convention in San Francisco. “You’ve got a lot of guys and women that have done just an amazing job and been very dedicated to our industry and their communities. For me, it was an honor just to be nominated. I never in a million years thought I’d be selected.”

..

The New Hampshire Automobile Dealers Association nominated Crews, 44, to represent the Granite State at the 98th annual national dealers convention. He was one of 55 nominees for the award, which he received Friday.

..

“It literally took my breath away,” Crews said. “This is a direct reflection on the team and employees of AutoFair.”



Crews grew up in Tucker, Ga., and served in the Marines before starting his career in the auto dealership industry. He joined AutoFair in 2006 and the organization has since expanded from three dealerships to seven, with about 600 employees.

..

Crews was also recognized for his community efforts, including the American Cancer Society’s CEOs Against Cancer, Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce, The Live Free or Die Alliance and Manchester’s Make the Grade program.

..

He has also worked with the Boys & Girls Clubs, animal shelters and food banks. Each November, AutoFair’s dealerships in New Hampshire donate a portion of the proceeds from every vehicle sold to New Horizons shelter and food pantry.

..

“There’s a lot of personal time that I’m able to put into the community because of the hard work and dedication of my employees,” Crews said. “The team I’ve got at AutoFair is what allows me to do in the community. Without their hard work and dedication, there’s no way I could be out working on the boards and being involved and being engaged in philanthropic and community service.”

..

The award is sponsored by Ally Financial, which provides $10,000 to go to the nonprofit of choice selected by the Dealer of the Year. Crews said he will pick a nonprofit when he gets home, which could take longer than expected.

..

Crews said he planned to spend a little time in San Francisco and the Napa Valley celebrating with his family after the convention wrapped up Sunday night. With New Hampshire in the path of a severe winter storm expected to arrive Monday night, Crews said his flight scheduled for Tuesday may have to be rescheduled.

..

“The celebration may be extended just a little bit,” he said.
