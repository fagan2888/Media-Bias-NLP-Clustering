His victory in \u201cThe Great American Race\u201d on Sunday gave \u201cThe Captain\u201d his second Daytona 500 title. Penske, one of the most respected team owners in motorsports, also has a record 15 Indianapolis 500 wins.\n\n\u201cDaytona 500, oh my God! Are you kidding me?\u201d Logano yelled in victory lane. \u201cI was so nervous the whole race.\u201d\n\nThe 24-year-old from Connecticut was quiet for most of the race, which was dominated by four-time champion Jeff Gordon.\n\nMaking the final Daytona 500 start of his career, Gordon won the pole and led the field to green in the first race of his last Sprint Cup season. Gordon kept his Chevrolet out front for 77 of the first 100 laps, and led a race-high 87 laps.\n\nBut when the slicing and dicing for the win began, Gordon was mired in traffic and Logano suddenly found himself in contention. He had reason to fret, though, after Team Penske teammate Brad Keselowski went to the garage with an engine failure.\n\nThen Ryan Blaney, another Ford driver, also lost an engine, and Logano was in danger of the same fate.\n\nBut after Blaney\u2019s engine failure set up a restart with 19 laps remaining, Logano buckled down for white-knuckle, three-wide racing throughout the field. He surged to the front and seemed to have the race under control, but a caution with three laps remaining forced him to fight for the win one last time.\n\nNASCAR needed nearly seven minutes of stoppage to clean the track, and it set up a two-lap sprint to the finish.\n\nLogano sat in his car thinking about a strategy, which wasn\u2019t the most comforting feeling.\n\n\u201cYou got a red flag, and they give you the opportunity to think of everything,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd even though Penske and a committee of team executives watch from the roof and offer advice, there was nothing in his ear with the win on the line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny because the whole team gets pretty quiet when you\u2019re about to win the Daytona 500,\u201d Logano said.\n\nHe got a terrific jump on the field, and as Kevin Harvick and Dale Earnhardt Jr. mounted their push for the lead, a wreck further back in the field brought out the yellow flag.\n\nIt froze the field and Logano won under caution. He\u2019s the second youngest Daytona 500 winner in history, behind only Trevor Bayne, who was 20 when he pulled off an upset victory in 2011.\n\nLogano\u2019s win gave Ford a sweep of the opening weekend at Daytona. Tyler Reddick won Friday night\u2019s Truck Series race driving for Keselowski, and Ryan Reed won the Xfinity Series race on Saturday for Roush Fenway Racing.\n\nFord also won the prestigious Rolex 24 at Daytona in January with Chip Ganassi Racing.\n\nReigning Sprint Cup champion Kevin Harvick finished second and was followed by Dale Earnhardt Jr., the defending race winner.\n\nDenny Hamlin finished fourth in a Toyota and was followed by six-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson, Casey Mears, Clint Bowyer, Martin Truex Jr., Kasey Kahne and Greg Biffle.\n\nGordon was involved in the final accident and finished 33rd.\n\nTony Stewart\u2019s drought at Daytona extended to 0-for-17 when he was involved in a multi-car accident on an early restart.\n\nStewart seemed to drift up the track into rookie Ryan Blaney, and the contact sent Stewart into the outside wall. Stewart took his car to the garage, returned to the race down 64 laps, and eventually called it a day and accepted his 42nd-place finish.\n\nIt was the first Daytona 500 in 15 years without one of the Busch brothers in the field.\n\nKurt Busch, the 2004 series champion, was suspended indefinitely by NASCAR as he faces accusations of domestic assault against his ex-girlfriend last fall. Suspended on Friday, he lost two appeals on Saturday that kept him from the race. Regan Smith finished 16th as the replacement driver for Stewart-Haas Racing.\n\nKyle Busch broke his right leg and his left foot in a Saturday crash in the Xfinity Series race. He was undergoing surgery at the same time his brother was arguing his second appeal. Matt Crafton, the two-time Truck Series champion, finished 19th as Joe Gibbs Racing\u2019s replacement driver.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Joey Logano wins first career Daytona 500", "title": "Joey Logano wins first career Daytona 500", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/22/joey-logano-wins-first-career-daytona-500/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150222__loganop1.jpg", "height": 451}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150222__loganop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-22T14:56:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T19:45:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s funny because the whole team gets pretty quiet when you\u2019re about to win the Daytona 500,\u201d Logano said.\nTyler Reddick won Friday night\u2019s Truck Series race driving for Keselowski, and Ryan Reed won the Xfinity Series race on Saturday for Roush Fenway Racing.\nHis victory in \u201cThe Great American Race\u201d on Sunday gave \u201cThe Captain\u201d his second Daytona 500 title.\n\u201cDaytona 500, oh my God!\nHe\u2019s the second youngest Daytona 500 winner in history, behind only Trevor Bayne, who was 20 when he pulled off an upset victory in 2011."}
