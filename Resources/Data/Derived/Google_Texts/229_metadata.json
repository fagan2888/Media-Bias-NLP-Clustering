Among those who quit was the head of the PVV in the European Parliament, Laurence Stassen.\n\nThe next big test for the party will come at European Parliament elections in May.\n\nThe PVV slipped five seats from a week ago to 22 and would come in third place behind the Socialist Party and the right-of-center Democrats 66, the poll showed. The PVV won 15 seats in the Dutch parliament in the 2012 election.\n\nWilders led the chant at a rally after municipal elections. He asked supporters in The Hague: \"Do you want more or fewer Moroccans in this city and in the Netherlands?\"\n\n\"Fewer! Fewer! Fewer!\", the crowd chanted. Wilders responded: \"We'll take care of that.\"\n\nThe comments drew widespread condemnation in the Netherlands and abroad. Thousands of people filed complaints of discrimination with Dutch prosecutors, while several PVV members have quit from the national assembly and city councils.\n\nOn Saturday, Wilders said he wasn't sorry, had not violated anti-discrimination laws and would not apologize to anyone.\n\nWhile Wilders also lost some support among his electorate, 85 percent of people who voted for him said they still backed him as leader of the Party for Freedom.\n\nA quarter of 1,200 PVV voters polled last week by television program EenVandaag said his comments went too far.
