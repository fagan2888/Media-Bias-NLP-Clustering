Sioux Falls, SD

A Sioux Falls natural food co-op damaged in a January arson fire has reopened in a temporary location.



Co-op Natural Foods General Manager Molly Langley says that a combination of volunteers, people in the community and a really sharp staff helped get the store back open.



No one was injured and nobody was in the building when the store burned Jan. 19. The co-op says more than $100,000 in inventory was destroyed and a small amount of money was taken.



The co-op says it has about 2,500 members, but anyone can shop at the store that does more than $2 million in business every year. It has 18 full-time and part-time employees and its suppliers include 40 local farmers.
