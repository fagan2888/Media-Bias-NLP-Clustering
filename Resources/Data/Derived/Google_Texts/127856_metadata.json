But Everett Middle School in San Francisco is not exactly a democracy, and Principal Lena Van Haren withheld publication of the results of a student council election because she didn\u2019t like the outcome\u2014too many of the winners were white.\n\nThe school is roughly 80 percent students of color, but the election results didn\u2019t reflect the school\u2019s diversity, according to KTVU:\n\n\u201cThat is concerning to me because as principal I want to make sure all voices are heard from all backgrounds,\u201d Van Haren said\u2026. \u201cWe\u2019re not nullifying the election, we\u2019re not cancelling the election and we\u2019re not saying this didn\u2019t count,\u201d Van Haren said. She said the school may possibly add positions in an effort to be more equal. \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful this can be a learning experience and actually be something that embodied our vision which is to help students make positive change,\u201d she added.\n\nBut an election is already a learning experience\u2014or would be, if administrators didn\u2019t hide the results. Teaching kids that authority figures always know better\u2014and will even re-jigger the outcome of a democratic election if they don\u2019t like the people the students picked\u2014not only sends the wrong message, it\u2019s blatantly unfair.\n\nIt\u2019s also possibly illegal, according to The Washington Post\u2019s Eugene Volokh:\n\nI\u2019m inclined to say, by the way, that attempting to \u201cadd positions in an effort to be more equal\u201d by (presumably) filling them with children of a particular race would likely violate the Equal Protection Clause and federal civil rights law. And even if one can somehow argue that such an action is \u201cnarrowly tailored to a compelling government interest\u201d in supposed \u201cdiversity,\u201d it violates the California Constitution\u2019s categorical ban on \u201cdiscriminat[ing] against, or grant[ing] preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race \u2026 in the operation of \u2026 public education.\u201d\n\nRoundly (and rightly) criticized for presuming to correct the student\u2019s election choices, Van Haren backed off, releasing the following statement:\n\nEverett Middle School is honoring the results of the Associated Student Body (ASB) elections. This is our first student council at Everett Middle School in recent history and we started up a student council because we want our students to have several ways to develop their leadership skills and be a part of shaping our school. We want a student leadership body that includes the range of perspectives and experiences of our students and we believe a representative body is an important part of democracy. When we reviewed the results of our Associated Student Body (ASB) elections on Friday, October 9th, we saw that it was not fully representative of our school population. I made the decision to pause on sharing the results with the students in order to capitalize on a teachable moment. I wanted to have a conversation with all of the candidates and ask for their ideas to make sure that all voices and groups are represented in our ASB. In retrospect, I understand how this decision to pause created concerns. Today I visited classrooms to announce the winners of the elections.\n\nI happen to think student governments are often silly organizations that reward students with very little actual power while teaching them to adore political life. But if a school is going to have an election at all, it really ought to honor the wishes of the voters.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Sending the wrong message", "title": "School Principal Withheld Student Council Election Results Because Winners Weren\u2019t Diverse Enough", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/10/20/school-principal-withheld-student-counci", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14453626096279.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sending the wrong message", "creator": "@robbysoave", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14453626096279.jpg", "title": "School Principal Withheld Student Council Election Results Because Winners Weren\u2019t Diverse Enough", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "article": {"tag": "Democracy", "published_time": "2015-10-20T17:50:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019re not nullifying the election, we\u2019re not cancelling the election and we\u2019re not saying this didn\u2019t count,\u201d Van Haren said.\nBut Everett Middle School in San Francisco is not exactly a democracy, and Principal Lena Van Haren withheld publication of the results of a student council election because she didn\u2019t like the outcome\u2014too many of the winners were white.\nWhen we reviewed the results of our Associated Student Body (ASB) elections on Friday, October 9th, we saw that it was not fully representative of our school population.\nBut if a school is going to have an election at all, it really ought to honor the wishes of the voters.\nBut an election is already a learning experience\u2014or would be, if administrators didn\u2019t hide the results."}
