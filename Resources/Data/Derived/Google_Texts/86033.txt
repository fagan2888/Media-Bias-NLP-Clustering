David Corn, the Washington Bureau Chief with Mother Jones, reports that an anti-Trump petition is making its way through the U.K. Parliament.

According to Corn, “an anti-Trump activist in Scotland is putting up a petition on the British government’s petitions site calling on the U.K. government to ban Donald Trump from entering the UK, claiming that his harsh rhetoric is hate speech.” The British government has barred people it has deemed purveyor of hate speech.



If the petition receives 100,000 signatures, the government is supposed to debate it, according to Corn.

“Right now, the petitions committee of Parliament is reviewing it.”

Here’s why the GOP establishment is concerned, according to Ball’s reporting Ted Cruz is perceived as more strategic and potentially harder to dislodge than Trump.
