Compensation for environmental services managers rose 8 percent on average between 2012 and 2015, the most of any category in a survey conducted by H&HN sister publication Health Facilities Management.

The jump may be connected to an increased focus on infection control and patient satisfaction and an overall increase in key job responsibilities, experts say.

“It appears some organizations are compensating environmental services better for assuming a larger role,” says Patti Costello, executive director for the Association for the Healthcare Environment which, along with the American Society for Healthcare Engineering, assisted with the survey.

“We are seeing managers taking on responsibilities for food service, transport, safety, security and many other areas directly linked to patient satisfaction, and many are also responsible for more than one campus,” she says.

The increased role is driven in part by merger and acquisition activity that may result in fewer staffers working in environmental services, effectively boosting the amount of work among those who remain.

Despite the increase in pay to $74,600, on average, environmental services managers were paid less than facilities, operations and engineering managers, whose salaries averaged $99,000, and construction managers, whose average pay was $118,139.

Construction and facilities management pay will continue to increase in tandem with the significant responsibility added to their roles, says Dale Woodin, senior executive director, ASHE.
