(AP) - Livestock have been quarantined on a western Nebraska farm following a diagnosis of a disease that can hamper an animal\u2019s ability to eat and drink, state officials said.\n\nThe Nebraska Agriculture Department said in a news release Friday that a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory confirmed the diagnosis of vesicular stomatitis. The sample was taken from an infected horse on a farm in Scotts Bluff County.\n\nState Veterinarian Dr. Dennis Hughes said the positive diagnosis could trigger animal import regulations in other states. Producers moving livestock from Nebraska into another state are encouraged to contact the state veterinarian\u2019s office in the state of destination to learn about specific import requirements.\n\nHughes said the case has prompted new requirements for horses and cattle coming to the AKSARBEN Stock Show and Rodeo to have been seen by a veterinarian within 48 hours. The event is Sept. 24-27 in Omaha.\n\nThe virus that causes vesicular stomatitis is spread by insects and from animal to animal through open sores and saliva. The virus causes painful oral blisters and sores and can affect cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, goats and other animals.\n\n\u201cThe best ways to reduce the chance of VS infection is to reduce the population of flies, mosquitoes and other biting insects as much as possible, and to isolate infected animals from uninfected animals,\u201d Hughes said.\n\nVesicular stomatitis generally isn\u2019t fatal, but it can cause economic losses to livestock producers, according to the USDA. Humans can become infected when handling ailing animals, but the USDA said that rarely happens.\n\nIn recent months, there have been several reported cases of the disease confirmed in areas of Wyoming, Colorado and South Dakota that border Nebraska\u2019s panhandle. Nebraska\u2019s last confirmed cases were last November in two cows in Wheeler County. Nebraska\u2019s last major outbreak of the disease was in 2005.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Livestock have been quarantined on a western Nebraska farm following a diagnosis of a disease that can hamper an animal's ability to eat and drink, state officials said.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/12/officials-livestock-on-western-nebraska-farm-quara/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Livestock have been quarantined on a western Nebraska farm following a diagnosis of a disease that can hamper an animal\u2019s ability to eat and drink, state officials said.", "title": "Officials: Livestock on western Nebraska farm quarantined"}, "twitter": {"title": "Officials: Livestock on western Nebraska farm quarantined", "description": "Livestock have been quarantined on a western Nebraska farm following a diagnosis of a disease that can hamper an animal's ability to eat and drink, state officials said.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfa74\"", "article_summary": "(AP) - Livestock have been quarantined on a western Nebraska farm following a diagnosis of a disease that can hamper an animal\u2019s ability to eat and drink, state officials said.\nProducers moving livestock from Nebraska into another state are encouraged to contact the state veterinarian\u2019s office in the state of destination to learn about specific import requirements.\nThe Nebraska Agriculture Department said in a news release Friday that a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory confirmed the diagnosis of vesicular stomatitis.\nIn recent months, there have been several reported cases of the disease confirmed in areas of Wyoming, Colorado and South Dakota that border Nebraska\u2019s panhandle.\nVesicular stomatitis generally isn\u2019t fatal, but it can cause economic losses to livestock producers, according to the USDA."}
