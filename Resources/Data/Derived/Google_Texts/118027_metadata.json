William Hoagland, senior vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center and former budget and appropriators director for Tennessee Republican Bill Frist when he was Senate majority leader, emphasized that in order to tee up a reconciliation bill, both chambers first must pass a fiscal 2016 budget resolution and negotiate a conference report, \u201cwhich hasn\u2019t been done in five years,\u201d he said. Without one, it\u2019s like \u201cgetting the cart out in front of the horse.\u201d\n\nAligning Means and Ends\n\nThe reconciliation process, created by the 1974 Budget Act (PL 93-344), works this way: Congress writes \u201cinstructions\u201d into its annual budget resolution directing various House and Senate committees to draw up legislative language to achieve the resolution\u2019s goals \u2014 in effect reconciling the law with the budget. The committees have some latitude in their methods of achieving this, but they must meet numeric targets. Their work is then combined into one or more bills and sent to the floors of both chambers.\n\nA reconciliation bill can pertain to a variety of budgetary and fiscal issues such as the health care law and a tax overhaul. But Gray says that \u201cyou only get so many bites at the apple in a given budget resolution.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, a reconciliation bill must adhere to various Senate rules, which are interpreted by the Senate parliamentarian and can only be overturned by 60 votes. The \u201cByrd Rule,\u201d named for late West Virginia Democrat Robert C. Byrd, requires that any \u201cextraneous\u201d provisions may be blocked from the process, including those that do not produce a change in outlays or revenues, those that suggest changes in Social Security or that are outside the jurisdiction of the committee that submitted the provision.\n\nSarah Binder, senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution and political science professor at George Washington University, says the tricky Senate rules were adopted later because \u201cwhen the Budget Act was written, there was no anticipation that this would be used as a short cut for a filibuster, or a mechanism for the Senate to work its will on the big issue of the day.\u201d\n\nBecause of the potential roadblocks and the lack of wiggle room for mistakes when it comes to reconciliation, Republican leaders have been careful to settle on a strategy. \u201cRepublicans haven\u2019t precisely shown their cards yet,\u201d Binder said.\n\nIf Republicans want to use the process to fully repeal the law, it would be a largely symbolic move. Hoagland said that in order to get such legislation through the \u201cByrd bath\u201d and on to the president\u2019s desk, lawmakers would probably need to include language in the budget resolution that would remove the restriction on provisions that would increase the federal deficit past a 10-year period. The CBO has estimated in the past that a full repeal of the health care law would increase the deficit.\n\nLawmakers could take a more piecemeal approach, in an effort to move legislation that has some Democratic support, by peeling off portions of the law that wouldn\u2019t be ruled extraneous, such as tax increases, insurance subsidies and Medicaid expansion. But provisions such as the insurance regulations would most likely not fall under the reconciliation umbrella, according to some experts.\n\nOrders in the Court\n\nAnother factor in determining the Republican strategy might hinge on the outcome of a Supreme Court challenge to the health care law\u2019s insurance subsidies, according to James C. Capretta, visiting scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and former Office of Management and Budget associate director.\n\nIf the justices rule that the federal government cannot offer health insurance subsidies to individuals in states that did not create their own insurance exchanges, \u201cCongress should be ready with a replacement plan, because subsidies would be in jeopardy for a large part of the country,\u201d Capretta said. \u201cThey could use reconciliation to begin replacing [the law] with provisions they like better.\u201d\n\nA decision on the case is not expected until summer, but many Republicans will want to quickly take some action on the health care law. Reconciliation could prove too slow and complicated for dismantling the law, but the filibuster-proof process might be too tempting to resist altogether.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019ll use reconciliation for something,\u201d Capretta said. \u201cThe question is, for what?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "", "og": {"site_name": "Roll Call", "description": "", "title": "Budget Reconciliation May Be Obamacare's Enemy", "url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/budget_reconciliation_may_be_obamacares_enemy-239166-1.html", "image": {"type": "image/png"}, "updated_time": "2015-01-09T18:34:03Z", "type": "website"}, "abstract": "", "fb": {"app_id": 1383531991672364}, "keywords": "iProCategory,iProStoryType,iProProductCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSpecialCategory,iProSDMID", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-09T18:34:03Z", "modified_time": "2015-01-09T18:34:03Z"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.rollcall.com/news/budget_reconciliation_may_be_obamacares_enemy-239166-1.html", "description": "", "site": "@rollcall", "card": "summary |player (See: https://dev.twitter.com/cards/types/player We will have to submit a test and get approval before using this type)", "title": "Budget Reconciliation May Be Obamacare's Enemy"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3626\"", "article_summary": "The CBO has estimated in the past that a full repeal of the health care law would increase the deficit.\nA reconciliation bill can pertain to a variety of budgetary and fiscal issues such as the health care law and a tax overhaul.\nEven then, the process is limited by Byzantine procedural rules, Congressional Budget Office scoring and Senate parliamentarian interpretation \u2014 and reconciliation certainly wouldn\u2019t be quick.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to use every tool that is out there, including reconciliation,\u201d Republican John Barrasso of Wyoming said recently in a speech on the Senate floor.\nReconciliation could prove too slow and complicated for dismantling the law, but the filibuster-proof process might be too tempting to resist altogether."}
