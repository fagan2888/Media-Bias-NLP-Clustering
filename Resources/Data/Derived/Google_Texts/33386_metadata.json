And with the U.S. government predicting there will be one million unfilled coding jobs by 2020, it\u2019s safe to assume Carson's services will likely be in demand.\n\nCarson launched TreeHouse, an online company that teaches users to code, make apps, develop websites and more, 2010 and is on a mission to help clients apply their newfound skill sets in the working world.\n\nCarson created the company with co-founder Alan Johnson, and it\u2019s based out of Portland, Ore. They've raised $13 million from Silicon Valley-based venture fund Social Capital and have 72 employees, many of which are remote workers based around the country.\n\n\"The main goal is to put people in job. It\u2019s a manifestation of what we are all about,\" Carson says. \"We want to take someone who knows nothing about tech, train them for six-to-12 months, and then place them in a job where they can make $45,000 a year. It's not just learn to code, it\u2019s code to work.\"\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo help advance support for the effort, TreeHouse announced Code-to-Work on Tuesday, a national initiative to train 150,000 workers nationwide by 2018.\n\nThe company is partnering with the Clinton Global Initiative America 2014, and launched \u201cCode Oregon\u201d in TreeHouse\u2019s hometown. Carson says the company will begin expanding across the country with similar programs throughout the year.\n\nTreehouse will partner with regional and local governments, workforce investment boards and community based organizations to help workers \"skill up,\" Carson says. Classes are $25 a month, and students typically spend one hour a day learning to code online.\n\nThey have 73,000 active students, he says, and are just beginning the job placement process in Oregon, with mentoring and job fairs for trainees.\n\n\"You don't need extreme math or physics skills to do this, you just need to be creative,\" he says. \"It's like writing stories. We help you take care of the hard part which is learning and getting the job.\"\n\nJob placement is not guaranteed, he says. The company has 14 full-time online teachers, and guides students through the process of getting resumes, cover letters and job applications together with checklists, he explains.\n\n\"I fully believe that if you work hard and put in the time, you will become job ready,\" Carson says. \"It's just like any university in that you have to want the job and interview well. The beautiful thing is that you can learn online, get your skills up to date and change careers.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-08 06:50:22 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Treehouse is on a mission to do more than just teach its online students to code.
