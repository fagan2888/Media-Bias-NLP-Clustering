Its $18 billion net income, up from $13 billion a year ago, is mainly due to selling 74.5 million iPhones in the quarter, volume that CEO Tim Cook called \u201chard to comprehend.\u201d\n\nAlso hard to comprehend is Apple\u2019s ripple effects on the broader U.S. economy.\n\nRelated: Rising Dollar Hits Blue Chips\n\nTo help explain, it\u2019s worth taking a look at some data rounded up by analyst Horace Dediu last week. His chart shows App store billings accelerated by 50 percent in 2014 to surpass U.S. box office revenues.\n\nThat\u2019s right, according to Dediu, apple\u2019s App Store is now bigger than Hollywood.\n\nGrowth really started accelerating in 2013, but doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing. Apple users spent $500 million in the App Store in the first week of January, Dediu notes. Since the App Store opened in 2008, it has paid out about $25 billion to developers. It paid out $10 billion in 2014 alone, he calculates.\n\nBased on Apple\u2019s payments to developers, he says apps are a \u201cbigger digital content business\u201d than music, TV and movies combined.\n\nDediu, who founded research firm Asymco, has a few other metrics to show the app economy is now bigger than Hollywood. He estimates that 627,000 jobs have been created by the App Store, more than the 374,000 people currently employed in Hollywood.\n\n\u201cThe curious thing,\u201d he notes, \u201cis that even though the medium of apps is swamping other forms of entertainment in all measurable ways, comprehension of the phenomenon is lagging.\u201d\n\nMaybe app developers need their own version of the Oscars.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "On Tuesday, Apple posted the largest quarterly profit of any company in history.", "title": "Apple\u2019s App Store Bigger Than Hollywood Box Office", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/28/Apple-s-App-Store-Bigger-Hollywood-Box-Office", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10052011_Apple_apps_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/01/28/Apple-s-App-Store-Bigger-Hollywood-Box-Office", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10052011_Apple_apps_article.jpg", "creator": "@ameystone", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "On Tuesday, Apple posted the largest quarterly profit of any company in history.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd87f5\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s right, according to Dediu, apple\u2019s App Store is now bigger than Hollywood.\nHis chart shows App store billings accelerated by 50 percent in 2014 to surpass U.S. box office revenues.\nHe estimates that 627,000 jobs have been created by the App Store, more than the 374,000 people currently employed in Hollywood.\nApple users spent $500 million in the App Store in the first week of January, Dediu notes.\nSince the App Store opened in 2008, it has paid out about $25 billion to developers."}
