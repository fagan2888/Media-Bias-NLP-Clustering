(REUTERS/Joshua Roberts)\n\n4226227\n\nFormer Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius took aim at her \u201chostile\u201d right-wing opponents Tuesday, in her first speech after resigning her top post.\n\nAt the State of Enrollment conference run by Enroll America, an Obamacare-promoting nonprofit run by former Obama White House staffer Anne Filipic, Sebelius addressed a friendly audience with a host of typical pro-Obamacare speakers, from insurance executive Dan Hilferty, Independence Blue Cross CEO, to Democratic Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear.\n\n\u201cWe had right-wing media, leadership in Congress who was determined on the House side to stop this law at any cost, shadow political organizations, hostile governors, hostile legislators, all working to make sure you couldn\u2019t do the job that was so important,\u201d Sebelius gushed, only once mentioning \u201cour well-known issues with the website\u201d putting a damper on customers getting coverage.\n\nSebelius even hit states for putting limits on navigators at all, seemingly, despite reports that personal information has already been put at risk. She hit back at the \u201crelentless obstruction\u201d of those who would put a check on Obamacare staffers asking for customers personal information \u2014 \u201cpeople who were forced with getting fingerprints and paying a fee in order to help people access health insurance.\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t alone. President Obama pre-taped a message for the conference, taking the opportunity to snipe at those who continue to oppose the health-care law in a short video.\n\n\u201cWe cannot let up now,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAs we look towards 2015, we need you to keep telling your stories, keep spreading the word, keep standing up for folks trying to get coverage \u2014 because the other side has billionaires funding campaigns to scare the very people the Affordable Care Act would help.\u201d\n\nWhile Obama and Sebelius hit their political opponents, Hilferty hinted that Americans should expect even more changes to the health-care law. Insurance companies are one of the largest beneficiaries of the health-care law, especially the individual mandate requiring everyone to carry health insurance.\n\n\u201cRegardless of one\u2019s politics, this is not a perfect law. This law will change over time because each of us will have input,\u201d Hilferty said. \u201cWhat will not change is that eight million Americans, plus those in the Medicaid arena, now have access to care. They won\u2019t go back \u2014 they won\u2019t allow us to go back.\u201d\n\nSebelius only addressed her agency\u2019s failure to create a working HealthCare.gov website on time with an odd rationalization, suggesting a working website would have decreased the number of sign-ups.\n\n\u201cCertainly I think better would\u2019ve been a website that was fully functional day one, I would trade those eight weeks in October and November in a heartbeat,\u201d Sebelius said, \u201cExcept someone said to me, \u2018Would you like a smooth website and four million enrollees or a rocky website and eight million\u2019 \u2014 I\u2019ll take the eight million any day.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration has still yet to say how many Obamacare customers have paid for their health insurance \u2014 or how many have continued to pay month after month. Low-income community health clinics have warned that some customers are unable to continue paying for coverage month after month.
