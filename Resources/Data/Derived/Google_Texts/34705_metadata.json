She worked at the Indianapolis franchise of the nation\u2019s biggest provider in the abortion industry, until Abby Johnson helped her to leave her job and turn her life around. In an interview for The Criterion, the nurse describes some of the horrors she witnessed at the clinic:\n\n\u201cOne young girl came in with her mom,\u201d Anderson told the paper. \u201cShe was about 16. Her mom had made the appointment. That\u2019s not supposed to be how it works. It\u2019s supposed to only be the patient who makes the appointment. I checked her in, and she thought she was there for a prenatal checkup. The mom was pushing it. She blindsided her own daughter.\u201d Another time, said Anderson, \u201cThis guy brought in a Korean girl. I had no doubt in my mind this girl was a sex slave. This guy would not leave her side. They could barely communicate. He wanted to make all the arrangements. During the ultrasound, she told one of the nurses that there were lots of girls in the house, and that the man hits them. She never came back for the abortion. I always wondered what happened to her. One of my co-workers said, \u2018You\u2019re better off to just let it go.\u2019\u201d When women cried during the abortion procedure, Anderson said, abortionist Michael King would shame them. \u201cThese girls would start crying on the table, and Dr. King would say, \u2018Now you chose to be here. Sit still. I don\u2019t have time for this.\u2019\u201d \u201cOne doctor, when he was in the POC [products of conception] room, would talk to the aborted baby while looking for all the parts. \u2018Come on, little arm, I know you\u2019re here! Now you stop hiding from me!\u2019 It just made me sick to my stomach,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThe sound the suction machine made when it turned on still haunts me.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with the term POC, read up on it here, when Abby Johnson explained it at an event for Pro-Life Action Ministries here in the Twin Cities in 2011.\n\nHere\u2019s more from the interview:\n\nQ. What was it like working there? A. \u201cIt was a money-grubbing, evil, very sad, sad place to work. \u201cWe would get yelled at if we didn\u2019t answer the phone by the third ring. They would tell us we\u2019d be fired [if we didn\u2019t] because they needed the money. \u201cThey would remind us in our weekly staff meeting that we need to tell everyone [who called to schedule an appointment] to avoid \u2018those people\u2019 [the sidewalk counselors] because we need the money. We were to tell them, \u2018Don\u2019t make eye contact with them, and don\u2019t stop in the driveway. If you make eye contact with them or if you stop and roll down your window, they\u2019re going to try their darnedest to talk you out of it.\u2019 \u201cYou have to have so many [abortions] a month to stay open. In our meetings they\u2019d tell us, \u2018If abortions are down, you could get sent home early and not get as many hours.\u2019 \u201cThey would allow girls to have ultrasounds that were obviously way too far along [the legal limit for having an abortion in Indiana is 13 weeks and six days]. They said, \u2018If they want to be seen, you just put them through, no problem,\u2019 just taking advantage to make money. \u201cI was always getting in trouble for talking too long to the girls, asking if they were sure they wanted to do this. \u201cIt was absolutely miserable going in there.\u201d \u2026 Q. When did you start having qualms or misgivings about working for Planned Parenthood? A. \u201cI started feeling uneasy working there when people came from [the] national [office] in New York City to teach us the conscious sedation process. It was disgusting. These two ladies had this chant they would do: \u2018Abortion all the time!\u2019 I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve got to get out of here.\u2019 That was about six to eight months after I started. \u201cThose women from New York acted like an abortion was a rite of passage. They were like, \u2018How can you not offer abortion to women? It\u2019s their body. They should be able to do whatever they want. How can you force them to have a baby? Abortion should be free to anybody, anytime.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBe sure to read it all.\n\nRecently in the Green Room:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Planned Parenthood worker: \u201cMoney-grubbing, evil, very sad, sad place to work\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Greenroom", "description": "Marianne Anderson should know.
