Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) can try to help House Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) take Rep. John Boehner\u2019s \u2019s soon-to-be-vacated job as House Speaker, and instead force a special extended conference meeting that can now happen without McMorris Rodgers\u2019 approval.\n\nThe debate is enabled by Rep. Peter Roskam (R-IL), who was circulating a letter to his colleagues calling for debate on the Speakership process. At least 50 fellow GOP members have signed Roskam\u2019s letter calling for a special conference meeting.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cIn one Saturday, we\u2019ve secured enough signers to ensure an extended special Conference devoted to discussing the Speaker\u2019s retirement and the best strategy to heal the divisions within our Republican majority,\u201d Roskam spokesman Michael Shapiro told Breitbart News on Saturday evening.\n\n\u201cThis is an important chance for all members of the Conference to give candid feedback about the conflicts that have prevented us from performing at the level we are capable of,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Rule requires such a special Conference meeting to be held as soon as practicable, which is an extremely important opportunity to reflect before we rush headlong into leadership elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear our members believe that we need a plan, not a person, to heal the fractures within our majority,\u201d Roskam told Breitbart. \u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019ll now have a chance for an open dialogue that will help us start to unify behind the conservative solutions the American people deserve.\u201d\n\nNow that Boehner is on the way out, and will be gone by the end of October, the House Freedom Caucus is trying to ensure the new Speaker adopts reforms that move Congress in the right direction.\n\n\u201cThe House Freedom Caucus has not yet decided who we will support for the office of Speaker of the House, nor for any positions that could subsequently become vacant,\u201d the House Freedom Caucus said in a joint statement.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to meeting with each of the candidates and our Republican Conference colleagues over the coming weeks in a careful and deliberative fashion to discuss how best to ensure that we follow regular order in the House and give a voice to the countless Americans who still feel that Washington does not represent them,\u201d the caucus said.\n\nThe caucus\u2019 decision to bloc-vote for a speaker candidate, rather than just allow the next person in line to get the job without reforms in the way the House does business, is extraordinarily significant. It reaffirms what Breitbart News reported on Saturday about how House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy won\u2019t be a shoo-in as Boehner\u2019s replacement.\n\nMcCarthy may end up getting the job in the end, but House Freedom Caucus members\u2014and other GOP conservatives in the GOP \u2014have enough votes to deny anyone the speakership, who is chosen during a full vote by all House Republicans and Democrats.\n\nBecause of the united conservative bloc, McCarthy will likely try to win support from conservatives, instead of splitting his party in a tough, no-holds barred fight that would damage party unity for some time.\n\nConservatives are asking that the House returns to following \u2018regular order\u2019 and that conservatives will included in the leadership\u2019s inner circle.\n\nUnder regular order, the House would debate and vote on funding bills each year before sending them to the Senate. The return to standard procedure would allow conservatives to include many of their voters\u2019 priorities in agency spending plans \u2014 and perhaps prevent GOP leaders from giving up conservatives\u2019 demands during an end-of-year budget crash with the White House.\n\nOnce the entire GOP caucus unites behind a new Speaker, either McCarthy or another candidate, it can use its united majority in a full vote of all House Republicans and Democrats to install Boehner\u2019s replacement.\n\nAt least one other candidate, Rep. Daniel Webster (R-FL)\u2014who ran nearly successfully against Boehner at the beginning of this Congress\u2014is running against McCarthy for the Speakership. Roskam (R-IL), as Breitbart News reported, may run as well.\n\nAn exclusive interview Webster conducted with Breitbart News is forthcoming. Webster is aiming to restore Congress to regular order, and stop crisis-to-crisis governance that Boehner has used by working to include more members in the legislative process and by solving problems quickly and up front rather than waiting until deadlines to do anything.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Roskam: Republicans Gather Enough Votes For Special Conference To Slow Down Speakership Election", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Roskam: Republicans Gather Enough Votes For Special Conference To Slow Down Speakership Election", "title": "Roskam: Republicans Gather Enough Votes For Special Conference To Slow Down Speakership Election", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Boehner-behind-McCarthy-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-09-27T14:48:09-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/27/roskam-republicans-gather-enough-votes-special-conference-slow-speakership-election/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Roskam: Republicans Gather Enough Votes For Special Conference To Slow Down Speakership Election", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/09/Boehner-behind-McCarthy-Getty.jpg", "title": "Roskam: Republicans Gather Enough Votes For Special Conference To Slow Down Speakership Election", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Boehner resignation, Daniel Webster, Kevin McCarthy, Peter Roskam, Speaker Vote,Big Government,Roskam", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-09-27T14:40:16-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-09-27T14:48:09-07:00", "tag": "Speaker Vote", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd12a6\"", "article_summary": "At least 50 fellow GOP members have signed Roskam\u2019s letter calling for a special conference meeting.\nIt reaffirms what Breitbart News reported on Saturday about how House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy won\u2019t be a shoo-in as Boehner\u2019s replacement.\nConservatives are asking that the House returns to following \u2018regular order\u2019 and that conservatives will included in the leadership\u2019s inner circle.\nThe debate is enabled by Rep.
