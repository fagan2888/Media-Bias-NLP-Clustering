Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\n\nGood morning.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\n\u2022 Republicans talk tough.\n\nJeb Bush and other Republican presidential candidates attacked Donald J. Trump on Tuesday night, united against Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to bar Muslims from entering the U.S. and arguing over who would be toughest in protecting Americans from terrorist threats.\n\nTed Cruz and Marco Rubio, first-term senators who are similar in many ways, had their most pointed face-to-face confrontation.\n\nWe\u2019ve fact-checked the debate statements and compiled video highlights.\n\nSo, who won? There\u2019s no agreement on a clear victor.\n\n\u2022 Watching the Fed.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s policy-making committee is expected to announce today that it will raise its benchmark interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade, as the U.S. economy has achieved steady growth and is close to full employment.\n\nThe rate is expected to be raised a quarter of a percentage point. The Fed has held the rate near zero for seven years as the pillar of its economic stimulus campaign.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHere\u2019s an unconventional look at what happens when the Fed raises rates.\n\n\u2022 Congress reaches a deal.\n\nRepublican and Democratic negotiators in the House agreed to a deal late Tuesday night on a $1.1 trillion spending bill to fund the U.S. government through 2016, and on a huge package of tax breaks.\n\nThe government also announced that it was extending through Thursday an enrollment period for full-year health insurance, beginning on Jan. 1, under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u2022 U.S. pushes on Syria and Iraq.\n\nDefense Secretary Ashton B. Carter is in Baghdad today to confer with Iraq\u2019s leaders on accelerating the U.S.-led campaign against the Islamic State.\n\nAnd Secretary of State John Kerry has been trying to find common ground with Russia\u2019s president so that peace talks on Syria can begin in early 2016.\n\n\u2022 Threats against public schools.\n\nThe two largest school systems in the U.S. confronted threats of a terrorist attack on Tuesday. New York City dismissed it as a hoax, but Los Angeles immediately shut down all public schools, upending the lives of parents, students and teachers.\n\nThe threats, emailed to school officials on both coasts, were largely identical and had been routed through a server in Frankfurt, apparently by the same person.\n\n\u2022 Baltimore awaits Freddie Gray verdict.\n\nJurors in the trial of Officer William G. Porter, charged with manslaughter in the April death of Freddie Gray, announced on Tuesday that they were deadlocked. They will resume deliberations this morning.\n\nGet the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox. Monday \u2013 Friday.\n\nPolice officers are bracing for possible protests, and jails are preparing extra space in case of numerous arrests.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2022 Executions down in U.S.\n\nThis year saw the fewest executions in nearly 25 years, and new death sentences imposed by courts fell to levels not seen since the early 1970s, according to a report released today.\n\n\u2022 Two thumbs up.\n\nOur chief film critic writes today that \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens,\u201d opening on Friday, brings \u201cnew kinetic wows along with some of the niceties that went missing as the series grew into a phenomenon.\u201d\n\nBUSINESS\n\n\u2022 President Xi Jinping of China, whose government has tightened control of the Internet in recent years, called today for other nations to cooperate in regulating it.\n\n\u2022 Hedge funds took a hit in 2015. Even billionaire managers with sterling records have been unable to avoid heavy losses.\n\n\u2022 General Electric, the largest U.S. industrial group, presents this afternoon its outlook for next year. G.E. is shifting away from finance and back to its industrial roots.\n\n\u2022 Wall Street stocks are gaining. European markets were positive, and Asian indexes finished broadly higher.\n\nNOTEWORTHY\n\n\u2022 Stormy weather \u2026\n\nA storm deposited 24 inches of snow on Colorado on Tuesday, after leaving about a foot of snow in the Salt Lake City area.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe storm moves to the Plains today.\n\n\u2022 \u2026 but not everywhere.\n\nWarm temperatures in the Northeast are weighing significantly on sales of boots, coats and other cold-weather items, and steep discounts are forecast.\n\n\u2022 Another Higgs boson?\n\nTwo separate teams of physicists say they have seen traces of what could be a new fundamental particle of nature.\n\n\u2022 Sports roundup.\n\nAbby Wambach, whose 184 goals are the most in international soccer, plays her final game with the U.S. team tonight.\n\nFour Cuban major leaguers were swarmed by fans in Havana at the start of a three-day good-will tour of the nation. The landmark trip was years in the making.\n\n\u2022 Ode to joy.\n\nBeethoven was born on this day in 1770, or a day close to it. A Times critic ranked him as the second-greatest classical music composer in history, after Bach.\n\n\u2022 Silly laws.\n\nOver the centuries, Britain has accumulated many laws that now seem irrelevant. A small team of officials is tasked with pruning them.\n\n\u2022 Healthier than dessert.\n\nA restaurant in smog-plagued China charged its customers a \u201cclean air fee.\u201d\n\nBACK STORY\n\nLong before Barack Obama was a player on the national stage, many pundits thought Colin L. Powell would be the first black American president.\n\nPhoto\n\nIt was 15 years ago today that Mr. Powell, the son of immigrants and a native of Harlem, was nominated as U.S. secretary of state, after a long and high-profile military career.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe was a Republican, a moderate, a charismatic media figure and a natural commander.\n\nBut Mr. Powell\u2019s support for the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq while secretary of state soured some of the public on him. And a distaste for politics turned him against running for elected office.\n\nHe ended up endorsing President Obama for both of his White House races.\n\nMr. Powell, 78, who left the Bush cabinet in 2005, still jumps into political issues. Notably, he came out in favor of the Iran nuclear agreement this year.\n\nIn recent speeches, he has criticized the Republican Party in general and Donald J. Trump in particular, as well as the paralysis of Congress and shifting sentiments against immigrants.\n\nAsked at a forum in September whether he was still a Republican, he answered, yes, \u201cbecause it annoys them.\u201d\n\nVictoria Shannon contributed reporting.\n\nYour Morning Briefing is published weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern and updated on the web all morning.\n\nWhat would you like to see here?
