But if that\u2019s the case, what made you decide to go against your loyalty and values and try to entrap me, and others that you considered close? As you know \u2013 when someone who is family is being accused for something they didn\u2019t do, no matter what you do, you _NEVER_ go against them\u2026What it comes down to is you had a choice, and not only did you screw me, you screwed 3 of the most closest people to you.\n\nIn addition to the guilt of just turning on some of his fellow hacktivists, 5hm00p is also feeling anguish due to his involvement in the death of another hacker named Junaid \u201cTriCk\u201d Hussain.\n\n\u201c\u2026I WAS HELPING YOU NEUTRALIZE JUNAID AS WE ORIGINALLY AGREED?
