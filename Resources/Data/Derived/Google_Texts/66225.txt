About RotaCare Bay Area

RotaCare Bay Area is a volunteer alliance of medical professionals, organizations and community members dedicated to providing free primary, quality healthcare services to uninsured families and individuals with limited ability to pay for medical care.

The organization was formed in 1989 when a local Rotarian and his club identified that many local residents had limited access to primary health care services. They resolved to meet the need, first with a clinic in Santa Clara. Since then, RotaCare Bay Area has grown to 12 clinics operating in Coastside (Half Moon Bay), Concord, Daly City, Gilroy, Monterey, Mountain View, Pittsburg, Richmond, San Jose, San Leandro, San Rafael, and Santa Cruz. In 2014, the Free Medical Clinics experienced over 28,170 patient visits. Since its founding, RotaCare has recorded more than 285,000 patient visits. The organization receives no government funding or insurance reimbursement.

Even with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, RotaCare Clinics are still very much in need. Millions of Californians remain uninsured and without an affordable option for Healthcare. RotaCare is poised and ready to be the safety net for those members of the community.
