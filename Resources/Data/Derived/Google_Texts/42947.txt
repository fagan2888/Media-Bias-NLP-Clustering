We talked earlier about the Obama administration’s new consumer safeguard, protecting investors planning for their retirement. Naturally, the financial industry isn’t pleased, and congressional Republicans are eager to scrap the regulation.

But note the specifics of the Republican talking points. NPR reported yesterday:

Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan sides with the brokers, tweeting last week that the final rule would become “Obamacare for financial planning.” He promised to push congressional action to hold up the rule, which will not be fully implemented until January 2018.

Oh, for goodness sake. Are we stuck in the “Obamacare for _______” framework again? Evidently, yes, and conservative media is only too pleased to go along. (The Daily Caller, on cue, is also complaining about “Obamacare for retirement planning.”)

To the extent that policy details matter, let’s note that the new financial-industry safeguards bear no resemblance whatsoever to the Affordable Care Act. I suspect that Republicans and their allies know that, but (a) they’re reluctant to fight on Wall Street’s behalf too openly; and (b) for lazy communications directors, simply throwing an “Obamacare” label on everything is vastly easier than thinking.

But forget policy details. This is about an elaborate, and unfortunate, rhetorical exercise.

Following up on our previous coverage , we talked last summer about the scene in “Being John Malkovich” in which John Malkovich crawls into the head of John Malkovich (long story). Suddenly, he’s stuck in a nightmare in which Malkovich is everywhere and everything.
