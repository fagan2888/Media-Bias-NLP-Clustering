( Luis Sinco/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images )\n\nAs you\u2019ve certainly heard by now, a mass shooting in San Bernardino on Wednesday morning has left at least 14 people dead and at least 17 wounded.\n\nTwo suspects in the attack, which occurred on the grounds of a social service facility called the Inland Regional Center, died in a gunbattle with police.\n\nWhat exactly is the Inland Regional Center and its mission?\n\nIt was created by the state as part of a network of regional centers, and it serves adults and children in San Bernardino and Riverside counties who have developmental disabilities.\n\nSuch disabilities include those resulting from Down syndrome, epilepsy, autism and cerebral palsy.\n\nIf you have a loved one with a developmental disability, your first stop in California is the regional center in your area. There are 21 regional centers statewide. As State of Health reported last week, regional centers were created after the 1969 Lanterman Act ended the mass institutionalization of people with developmental disabilities and created the network of the nonprofit centers.\n\n\u201cThe majority of work that regional centers do,\u201d said Eileen Richey, executive director of the Association of Regional Center Agencies, \u201cis providing case management services to people with developmental disabilities as well as their families.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile most of the direct services or treatments happen at providers\u2019 offices in the community, clients and families are frequently found in the regional centers.\n\n\u201cThey could be there for a development plan,\u201d Richey said in an interview, \u201cand they could be at a regional center for an evaluation or an assessment for services.\u201d\n\nAlmost certainly, people with developmental disabilities and family members were in the Inland Regional Center when the shooting started. The Inland center is the state\u2019s largest, with more than 600 staff members and 30,000 clients. It\u2019s hard to gauge how widespread the impact of today\u2019s events will be on the center\u2019s clients.\n\nHelping a loved one with a developmental disability cope with the tragedy will depend on the person, says Karla McLaren, the Santa Rosa author of \u201cThe Art of Empathy.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone will experience it differently,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s important to listen to the person\u2019s own fears or own concerns \u2026 and to talk about that frankly.\u201d\n\nOlivia Balcao, a social worker and senior program analyst with the Association of Regional Center Agencies, said it\u2019s important to be aware of the person\u2019s disability and their own ability to take in the information.\n\n\u201cYou share an amount and try to see how much they\u2019re grasping, how much they\u2019re processing, if they have any questions, and give them the lead.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The center is one of 21 regional agencies created by the state to deliver services to residents with developmental disabilities such as Down syndrome, cerebral", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"The Story Behind the Inland Regional Center, Site of San Bernardino Massacre\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/12\\/02\\/inland-regional-center-san-bernardino-mass-shooting\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-12-02 19:33:52\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-12-03 17:25:26\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":117430,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Inland Regional Center\",\"News\",\"San Bernardino\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/12\\/InlandRegionalCenter.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The center is one of 21 regional agencies created by the state to deliver services to residents with developmental disabilities such as Down syndrome, cerebral palsy and autism.", "title": "The Story Behind the Inland Regional Center, Site of San Bernardino Massacre", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/12/02/inland-regional-center-san-bernardino-mass-shooting/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/12/RS17552_GettyImages-499638876-qut-800x533.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "inland regional center,news,san bernardino", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "A helicopter hovers around the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California, the scene of a mass shooting on Wednesday.\nTwo suspects in the attack, which occurred on the grounds of a social service facility called the Inland Regional Center, died in a gunbattle with police.\nWhat exactly is the Inland Regional Center and its mission?\nIf you have a loved one with a developmental disability, your first stop in California is the regional center in your area.\nThe Inland center is the state\u2019s largest, with more than 600 staff members and 30,000 clients."}
