Anchor Equity, KKR Snag Groupon's Ticket Monster

Groupon bought e-commerce company Ticket Monster from Living Social in 2013

Private equity firms Anchor Equity Partners and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. LLP (NYSE: KKR) are buying a majority stake in mobile commerce business Ticket Monster Inc. from Groupon Inc. (NYSE: GRPN).

Seoul, South Korea-based Ticket Monster is a mobile ticketing company that Groupon bought from Living Social Inc. for $260 million in 2013. The company operates an online retail marketplace in South Korea that sells clothing, household and fast-moving consumer goods, local services and travel deals. About 70 percent of Ticket Monster's users complete their purchases via mobile device.

In addition to Anchor and KKR, which will hold equal stakes in the business, pension, sovereign wealth funds and institutional investors, including the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Pavilion Capital, will also invest in the deal.

KKR made the deal through Asian Fund II. The firm has invested more than $13 billion in technology-related companies, including GoDaddy and Internet Brands.

Anchor, headquartered in Seoul, invests in services, logistics, and consumer goods and retail companies.

Reports circulated earlier this month that Chicago-based Groupon might sell some of its units to raise cash. Ticket Monster was included in that assessment -- a Piper Jaffray analyst said the business could go for as much as $500 million. Terms of the sale were not disclosed, but the investment was based on a $782 million fully-diluted valuation of Ticket Monster, the buyers said.
