Scott Walker checks out a motorcycle after speaking to several hundred supporters during a stop in North Charleston Wednesday morning at Low Country Harley-Davidson. This was the his first visit to the area since declaring his candidacy to become President. (Brad Nettles/Staff) 7/15/15\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker previewed his presidential priorities for about 200 GOP faithful during an appearance Wednesday morning at Low Country Harley- Davidson \u2014 repealing Obamacare and the Iran pact and taking on unions.\n\nOnline To stay up-to-date on South Carolina politics, go to palmettopolitics.com or download the Palmetto Politics app for iOS or Android.\n\nWalker, who became the 16th Republican presidential hopeful on Monday, has led polls in Iowa and hoped to solidify his standing in the first Southern state to hold a presidential primary next year.\n\nWalker, who said he had worn his \u201cHarley boots\u201d to the North Charleston business, talked about his upbringing in Wisconsin, the son of a Baptist minister whose first jobs included washing dishes and flipping burgers. He also talked about his accomplishments as governor, including surviving a 2012 recall election.\n\nHis 25-minute speech also outlined his vision if elected president, with repealing Obamacare and the newly announced Iran nuclear agreement at the top of his agenda.\n\nHe is running on his record in Wisconsin, where he received steady applause while noting his successful efforts to promote Republican red-meat issues such as touting concealed carry laws, defunding Planned Parenthood and requiring a photo ID to vote.\n\n\u201cIf those reforms can work in a blue state like the one I live in, they can work anywhere,\u201d he said.\n\nHe praised South Carolina and Gov. Nikki Haley for showing the nation how to become united after last month\u2019s fatal shooting of nine people at an Emanuel AME Church Bible study in Charleston.\n\nWhile Walker visited Charleston this spring, Wednesday marked his first visit since making his presidential run official. He talked about not having slept in 24 hours, partly because he flew Tuesday from Las Vegas to Memphis. Tenn., and then missed a connecting flight in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cSo a little before 3 o\u2019clock this morning, we left Atlanta and drove here because we didn\u2019t want to let you down,\u201d said Walker, who ran about 45 minutes late.\n\nKristi Caldwell of North Charleston grew up in Wisconsin and was impressed. \u201cAs of today, I made up my mind because he\u2019s on the money,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he can do it in Wisconsin, he can do it all over this country.\u201d\n\nHowever, Republican Marc Knapp said Walker was his top choice \u2014 at least until Donald Trump entered the fray.\n\n\u201cI like Donald because he reminds me of me,\u201d Knapp said. While he agreed with Walker, \u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything about immigration. That\u2019s one thing I wanted to hear,\u201d Knapp said.\n\nBut Jim Davis, the South Carolina GOP\u2019s 1st District chair, said Walker is near the top of his list because he\u2019s \u201cfirm, not fiery silly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe (Walker) doesn\u2019t just throw out gratuitous stuff to get people fired up,\u201d Davis said.\n\nElaine Magliacane of North Charleston said Walker is among her top choices, saying she is particularly pleased with how he stood up to the unions there.\n\nGreg Burlos of Mount Pleasant was among those who arrived early in the morning to wait for Walker.\n\n\u201cIf I had to vote today, it would be for this guy,\u201d Burlos said, adding that he liked Walker\u2019s relative youth (at 47, he is the fourth youngest in the 16-candidate GOP field) and thought he would make a great ticket with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\n\u201cIf we nominate an old white guy, we\u2019re done,\u201d Burlos said. \u201cThe old white guy is done.\u201d\n\nReach Robert Behre at 937-5771.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Scott Walker looks to solidify support with Lowcountry visit, News, \r\nNewsPolitics, \r\nElections, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nCivic Science Poll, \r\nCivic Science Poll, concealed carry,GOP presidential primary,Iran,Planned Parenthood,Scott Walker,Wisconsin", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Wisconsin Gov.
