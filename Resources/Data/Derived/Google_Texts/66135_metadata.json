UMS 2013 saw an estimated 16,000 people, and 2012 hosted roughly 14,000 attendees.\n\nView photos from the 2014 Underground Music Showcase\n\n\u201cLast night was a record Saturday night,\u201d Smith said Sunday. \u201cIt was probably the largest crowd UMS has ever seen.\u201d\n\nSmith attributes the steady growth to the showcase\u2019s programming.\n\nActs ranging from the psychedelic Denver-based rock duo Sunboy to the internationally recognized rappers People Under the Stairs hit the main stage at Security Service Federal Credit Union building\u2019s parking lot off Broadway over the course of the festival.\n\nDiana Prulhiere, who moved to Denver two months ago from Charleston, W.Va., attended UMS for the first time. She said she had little knowledge about the performers but liked \u201cthat there are so many bands and performances so close together in such a short time. It\u2019s a good way to get exposed to music you might not be familiar with or hear on the radio.\u201d\n\nBreckenridge Brewery provided beer at the main stage, as well as at more than a dozen South Broadway venues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more about the Denver bands for me,\u201d said Ryan Workman, the company\u2019s field marketing manager, who was able to sneak away from work to listen to his favorites. \u201cColfax Speed Queen was maybe the best show.\u201d\n\nLarry Nix, the drummer of Colfax Speed Queen, said before his set Friday night at 3 Kings Tavern that the show would be \u201ca disaster, in the best way. We\u2019re going to break some legs.\u201d\n\nThey nearly did. A fierce mosh pit broke out during the performance, with beer showers and whiskey shots flying in the air to the frenetic tune of the band\u2019s thrashing, which Workman described as \u201calmost like dark, surf punk.\u201d\n\nOther highlights from the end of the fest included a glitter shower during Ned Garthe Explosion, a bandmate\u2019s wedding proposal at the end of The Royal\u2019s set, and a guerrilla, secret show staged by Rubedo in the vacant lot by Kitty\u2019s South Adult Entertainment Center.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I loved about this year,\u201d Rubedo vocalist Kyle Gray said. \u201cIt\u2019s even more underground than The Underground Music Showcase.\u201d\n\nJordan Gonzalez contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Underground Music Showcase draws big crowds for indie bands", "title": "Underground Music Showcase draws big crowds for indie bands", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/27/underground-music-showcase-draws-big-crowds-for-indie-bands/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140727___1SM5164p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140727___1SM5164p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-27T19:43:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T10:56:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s even more underground than The Underground Music Showcase.\u201dJordan Gonzalez contributed to this report.\nView photos from the 2014 Underground Music Showcase\u201cLast night was a record Saturday night,\u201d Smith said Sunday.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more about the Denver bands for me,\u201d said Ryan Workman, the company\u2019s field marketing manager, who was able to sneak away from work to listen to his favorites.\nThe Denver Post\u2019s 14th Underground Music Showcase finished strong Sunday, with day parties raging in full force and nearly 150 acts scheduled from noon until late into the night.\nThe festival, which highlights the best local independent artists, featured more than 400 performances at nearly 20 venues along South Broadway over four days."}
