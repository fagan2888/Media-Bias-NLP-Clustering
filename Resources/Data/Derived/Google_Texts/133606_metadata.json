The Journal consulted experts who say the site is poorly coded.\n\nAt the same time, the NYT reports that administration officials say that some key software on the site failed after facing such a heavy crush of users. And while I\u2019m sure the crush of visitors was, well, crushing, others are suggesting that that\u2019s not a very good excuse for a site being pretty much inoperable for a week.\n\nThe week wasn\u2019t an entire disaster. In some places, like Washington, DC, the launch went off without a glitch. In other places, like California and Florida, people were either finding it impossible to get to the home page, or to log in, or to fill out their application (which apparently, according to the exchanges, is the same thing as creating an account on the site \u2013 we\u2019ll get to that bizarre conflation of terms in a moment), or to get their application confirmed, and so on.\n\nNow, keep in mind that in some states \u2013 14, and the District of Columbia \u2013 any problems people faced are the states\u2019 fault, as those states are in charge of running the exchanges. But in 36 states, the federal government is in charge of the exchange. And the federal exchange was the glitchiest of them all.\n\nBig caveat: I had no problem logging on to the DC exchange that first day, and finding two plans that potentially interested me. What I did have a problem doing was checking out plans for my sister in Illinois. Illinois is one of the 36 states where you need to go the main federal exchange site, HealthCare.gov, in order to review potential insurance plans.\n\nThe DC site is a joy. You can apply for coverage or simply browse plans \u2013 and the button you click in order to browse plans is labeled \u201cbrowse plans.\u201d If you choose to browse plans, you create an account by choosing a username and password, and that\u2019s it. Next it asks you to create some security questions, and then you\u2019re in. You can browse the various plans, or even apply for one if you like.\n\nThe Federal exchange is no such joy. Due to the heavy traffic, and the glitches, it took up until Sunday for me to even be able to reach the part of the site where you begin the process of setting up an account, a requirement for perusing the plans. First off, it\u2019s not terribly clear on the federal exchange site how to browse plans at all. On the DC site, you click the \u201cbrowse plans\u201d button, instead of the \u201capply now\u201d button. On the federal site, you simply have to click \u201clearn more,\u201d and then it starts asking you lots of questions about your age range, whether you already have insurance, etc.\n\nThat then takes you to a page that is confusing as hell, and says nothing at all about browsing plans. All you can do on that page is \u201capply\u201d for a plan. I didn\u2019t want to apply for a plan, but lacking any other choice, I clicked \u201capply now,\u201d even though I didn\u2019t want to apply now.\n\nAfter I clicked through, I was required to enter all sorts of personal information, including my phone number and home address (including zip plus four, which I had to go look for), which only furthered my concern that I was actually \u201capplying\u201d for insurance, when I simply wanted to window shop. I wonder how many people stopped right here, thinking they were \u201capplying\u201d for insurance and didn\u2019t want to do that just yet.\n\nSo I created some dummy info \u2013 I was, after all, simply trying to help my sister back in Illinois, and the site was having none of it. First, it required a working email address \u2013 then it sends you an email you have to click on, and then you return to the site and fill out more information. So I went back, started all over again, and gave it a real email address this time. (The DC exchange doesn\u2019t not require an email at all, and gives you immediate access to the various plans right after you create a username and password \u2013 though they do ask you to create some security questions.)\n\nSo I created another new account, this time using a real email address, and I kept getting error messages, telling me that it couldn\u2019t create the account. Eventually it worked, and that\u2019s when things got really fun. Somehow the federal exchange figured out that I was creating a dummy account, so it kept telling me it couldn\u2019t verify who I was. So I finally entered my sister\u2019s real name, address and phone number.\n\nWell, HealthCare.gov was having none of that. Apparently, entering my sister\u2019s REAL information raised some red flag, and the site was now demanding copies of my government IDs that were going to be reviewed by some actual human being before I received the honor of being permitted to simply browse some insurance plans.\n\nI could almost hear the German accent.\n\n\u201cSubmit documents that prove your identity.\u201d Right, like my mom is going to know how to scan a document, let alone upload it to a Web site. And who, in any case, is going to start uploading their official documents to a Web site they simply want to browse?\n\nI quit the entire venture in disgust.\n\nUnless this is all part of the ongoing glitch \u2013 and I\u2019m sure some of it is, but not all of it is \u2013 why should I have to prove who I am in order to simply browse the damn plans? You don\u2019t have to prove who you are on the DC exchange in order to browse the plans. Why should I have to do it on the federal site? And putting aside for a moment the ridiculous use of the phrase \u201capply now\u201d in order to mean \u201cjust browse, you don\u2019t really have to \u2018apply,\u2019 \u201d why require a working in-state home address and phone at all? In order to give me accurate quotes, all they need is my birthday and my state of residence, and maybe \u2013 maybe \u2013 my county, though that\u2019s questionable. So a birthday and zip code should suffice.\n\nInstead, I got the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nWhy does it matter? Well, I don\u2019t plan on spending my entire life in Washington, DC. (God forbid.) At some point, I\u2019d like to peruse the plans in Illinois because, you know, sometimes people move from one state to another. How exactly do I look over the Illinois plans if I don\u2019t have a \u201creal\u201d verified address in Illinois? And what is the crime in simply giving people access to the plans without jumping through all these hoops? If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d say this site feels like an effort in list-building \u2013 i.e., they want to collect as much information as possible about everyone who visits, even if they\u2019re not buying anything, in order to create a huge database for who knows what reason. And not to get all Glenn Beck on them, but it\u2019s none of their damn business who I am, or what my phone number or home address is, until I decide to apply for a plan. Period.\n\nThen I had a eureka moment. I\u2019ll just call the 800 number they provide on the site, and ask them how to get the plans. So I called, and the recording told me there was a 30 minute wait. I promptly hung up.\n\nI\u2019ve worked as an Internet consultant for 16 years. The federal exchange is poorly designed. The majority of the people are going there for two reasons \u2013 one really \u2013 to browse plans. So give them access to the damn plans, and make it easy for them. Don\u2019t make them hunt all over the page in order to figure out where to even click to begin browsing, and then when they figure out they\u2019re supposed to click the \u201capply now\u201d button, even though they don\u2019t want to apply now, don\u2019t make them fill out an entire autobiography just to compare plans and prices.\n\nAgain, the DC site doesn\u2019t require any of this info or all of these hoops, and it does just fine letting us browse the correct plans. So why is the federal site so complicated and intrusive ?\n\nI\u2019m a big supporter of Obamacare. I wasn\u2019t thrilled that the law didn\u2019t go farther, but I always felt \u2013 and increasingly feel \u2013 that the fixes for annual and lifetime limits, and pre-existing conditions, for starters, would be a huge deal. And they are. But we shouldn\u2019t be giving the Republicans fuel for the fire, and this Web site \u2013 poorly designed as it apparently is \u2013 is fuel.\n\nIt\u2019s still a bit of a mystery why the DC government was able to come up with a pretty good site, while the federal one is a confusing and complicated mess. But there you have it. Let\u2019s hope that they get the glitches fixed pronto, then go back and overhaul the entire thing. It should be far easier, quicker, and less complicated to access the plans. Here\u2019s hoping that at some future date it is.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There's no excuse for the problems the Obamacare exchange Web site has been having.
