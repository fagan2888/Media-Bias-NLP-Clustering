Besides the typical healthy fats and proteins, this peanut butter contains 170 milligrams of caffeine per two tablespoon serving \u2013 the same amount of caffeine as two cups of coffee.\n\nRelated: Caffeine Helps Memory Even a Day Later\n\nThe developers say that because peanut butter takes longer to digest than coffee, the caffeine is released slowly throughout the day without the consumer feeling jittery. The product also contains electrolytes and protein, which \u201cmakes it perfect not only for athletes and active people, but also for normal life,\u201d according to the company website.\n\nSo far, STEEM is only available online and in a handful of stores in Connecticut and Massachusetts, but if U.S. Senator Charles Schumer has his way, it soon won\u2019t be sold anywhere. Schumer said on Sunday that one serving of STEEM contains five times the amount of caffeine in one can of Coke.\n\nSchumer urged the Food and Drug Administration to investigate the health effects of using caffeine in peanut butter and other products, and especially its effect among children. He also fears that STEEM could pave the way for other caffeine-heavy products to enter the market.\n\nRelated: FDA Overwhelmed by Scores of New Food Additives\n\n\u201cCaffeinated peanut butter should spur the agency to address the issue of caffeine,\u201d he said. \u201cThey should put limits on how much is allowed, particularly in snack foods and foods that are not ingested for caffeine\u2019s sake, like Red Bull. And they should certainly require warning labels.\u201d\n\nSTEEM company executives told Quartz that the company \u201ccomplied with any and every obligation we were required to before putting our product out on the shelves.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Your morning cup of coffee could soon turn into a spoonful of peanut butter if a new c", "title": "Your Peanut Butter Choices: Chunky, Creamy, or\u2026Caffeinated?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/09/Your-Peanut-Butter-Choices-Chunky-Creamy-or-Caffeinated", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Peanut_Butter_Flickr_Denise_Krebs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/09/Your-Peanut-Butter-Choices-Chunky-Creamy-or-Caffeinated", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Peanut_Butter_Flickr_Denise_Krebs.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@milliedent"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Your morning cup of coffee could soon turn into a spoonful of peanut butter if a new c", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Launched last year, a new product called STEEM Peanut Butter is now on grocery store shelves.\nYour morning cup of coffee could soon turn into a spoonful of peanut butter if a new company has its way.\nBesides the typical healthy fats and proteins, this peanut butter contains 170 milligrams of caffeine per two tablespoon serving \u2013 the same amount of caffeine as two cups of coffee.\nRelated: FDA Overwhelmed by Scores of New Food Additives\u201cCaffeinated peanut butter should spur the agency to address the issue of caffeine,\u201d he said.\nSchumer urged the Food and Drug Administration to investigate the health effects of using caffeine in peanut butter and other products, and especially its effect among children."}
