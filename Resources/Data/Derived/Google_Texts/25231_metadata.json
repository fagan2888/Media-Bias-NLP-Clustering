All simplify the \u201cwhat\u2019s for lunch or dinner?\u201d process and reduce the number of clicks you have to get a meal.\n\nRelated: The Silent Society: How Americans Have Replaced Words with Clicks\n\nHere are three apps that will change the way we order food:\n\nUberEATS\n\nUber, the rideshare company, has launched its on-demand meal delivery service in Chicago and in New York City. The service was already piloted in Los Angeles and in Barcelona.\n\nUberEATS works just like Uber. Instead of picking a customer, a driver delivers lunch or dinner to that customer. You simply need to enter your address into UberEATS, visible only in your Uber app when in the coverage area, and tap view menu. It changes daily and features only a couple of dishes. You\u2019ll then select your meal, place your order and your driver will be curbside within 10 minutes or less.\n\nArcade\n\nMaking food ordering even simpler and targeting the indecisive, Arcade sends you a text message every morning at 10 a.m. with only one dish from one New York City restaurant they have picked for the day (the dish changes daily). You simply have to reply \u201cyes\u201d by 11 a.m. if you want that dish for lunch. Your food will be delivered by 1 p.m.\n\nThe dish is typically priced between $8 and $15, including delivery fees and tip. \u201cWe wanted to simplify this whole business to a level where nothing could be simpler,\u201d Arcade Founder Shaunak Amin told Food Republic.\n\nRelated: 5 Food Delivery Apps for the Hungry and Lazy\n\nMaple\n\nMaple operates like a restaurant. It has a kitchen staff of 22 cooking a daily menu of only three fresh dishes for $12 each, including tip and delivery. The menu is curated by rock-star chef David Chang of Momofuku fame. The only difference is that it\u2019s not a restaurant but a food delivery app that delivers within 30 minutes.\n\nMaple is so far only delivering in the Lower Manhattan\u2019s Financial District but plans to open a kitchen in every neighborhood it serves to minimize the delivery time, according to Wired.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Unless you know exactly what you\u2019re craving today, getting on Seamless or Delivery.com can easily become overwhelming, but new apps have sprouted this week to reduce the number of clicks you have to make to order lunch.", "title": "3 New Food-Delivery Apps Make Ordering Even Simpler", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/29/3-New-Food-Delivery-Apps-Make-Ordering-Even-Simpler", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/UberEATS-menu-Godmother-1024x683.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/29/3-New-Food-Delivery-Apps-Make-Ordering-Even-Simpler", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/UberEATS-menu-Godmother-1024x683.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Unless you know exactly what you\u2019re craving today, getting on Seamless or Delivery.com can easily become overwhelming, but new apps have sprouted this week to reduce the number of clicks you have to make to order lunch.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd99d8\"", "article_summary": "Food delivery apps are supposed to make your life easier, but unless you know exactly what you crave, using Seamless or Delivery.com can quickly become overwhelming.\nTwo new apps have sprouted this week in Manhattan, including Arcade and Maple, and UberEATS, is available in three cities.\nRelated: 5 Food Delivery Apps for the Hungry and LazyMapleMaple operates like a restaurant.\nThe only difference is that it\u2019s not a restaurant but a food delivery app that delivers within 30 minutes.\nThe dish is typically priced between $8 and $15, including delivery fees and tip."}
