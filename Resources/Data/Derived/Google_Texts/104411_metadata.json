(And Fields and the rest of the United States are under the First Ladyship of Michelle Obama, of course.)\n\nWhile both Fields and myself may be exulting in McCray\u2019s new title, not everyone has been thrilled with the Black First Lady we\u2019ve had for the last six years. While Black women practically celebrated in the streets when Michelle Obama stepped into the role in 2008, some white feminists met the nation\u2019s first Black First Lady with confounding silence. As I wrote in a 2008 article for the blog Michelle Obama Watch:\n\nMichelle Obama is getting short shrift \u2026 from the mainstream white feminists who were screaming and screaming about Hillary Clinton. \u2026There's still a sense of silence. \u2026 People are shuffling their feet.\n\nThen, when the FLOTUS claimed the mantle of \u201cMom-in-Chief,\u201d the silence became a chorus of indignation\u2014an especially perplexing response in light of the fragile denouement of the years-long, media-fueled \u201cMommy Wars,\u201d which ended with most feminists agreeing not to judge each other\u2019s marital, parental and career choices. As blogger Trudy wrote at Gradient Lair about the \u201cMom-in-Chief\u201d controversy:\n\nIf [White women ] cannot understand the history, let alone the emotion, involved in Black women being able to be MOTHERS to THEIR OWN CHILDREN with the care and love that for CENTURIES was often only allotted to WHITE CHILDREN (though this myth of the loving mammy has backfired at times on White women whose racially and emotionally immature views of parenthood meant that their children ended up hurt or dead because they couldn\u2019t even conceive of anyone not worshipping their White children [as they is not kind, smart or important] so they ignored clear as day signs from the today nanny or yesterday mammy that she herself was hurting or not well and a risk to those kids) then they don\u2019t see us. If they cannot understand the POWER in Obama\u2019s unapologetic love for his Black wife and Black daughters, commenting on their intelligence, character and yes, beauty, in a world where for centuries up until this very moment and future moments, Black women aren\u2019t allowed to be anything but mammies, Sapphires and Jezebels and if we\u2019re lucky \u201cstrong\u201d at best, they don\u2019t see us. If it wasn\u2019t so sad it would be funny watching White feminists, many of whom are class privileged and don\u2019t even truly raise their own children, bash Michelle for her pride in motherhood (as if somehow this erases her r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u2014which seems to be their focus, as if she can\u2019t have a plethora of roles) yet have no problem with their Black and Latina nannies.\n\nThen Michelle Cottle, a white woman writing at Politico, added fuel to the fire by calling FLOTUS Obama a \u201cfeminist nightmare\u201d because Obama uses her Mom-in-Chief pulpit to urge healthy eating and to encourage young people of color to go to college. Cottle charged that the FLOTUS should have been \u201cmore aggressive\u201d by taking on \u201cedgier\u201d issues such as \u201cthe myriad problems eating away at minority communities\u201d\u2014as though diet-related illnesses and lack of collegiate training in a knowledge-based economy aren't problems for poor communities of coor. It was mostly Black feminists, like Dr. Brittney Cooper, who had to tell these feminist fearmongers to \u201clean back\u201d from such assertions. Professor and MSNBC host Dr. Melissa Harris-Perry explained to Cottle that for quite a few Black women, Michelle Obama is a feminist dream:\n\nYou misunderstand the place that Michelle Obama occupies as the first African American First Lady. You seem to think she\u2019s trying to steer clear of the Angry Black Woman stereotype. But when she calls herself \u201cMom-In-Chief,\u201d she\u2019s rejecting another stereotype: the role of Mammy. She\u2019s saying that her daughters\u2014her vulnerable, brilliant, beautiful Black daughters\u2014are the most important things to her. The First Lady is saying, \u201cYou, Miss Ann, are going to have to clean your own house, because I will be caring for my own.\u201d And instead of agreeing that the public sphere is necessarily more important than Sasha and Malia, she has buried Mammy and embraced being a mom on her own terms. So you can call that your \u201cfeminist nightmare,\u201d but for many of us, it\u2019s our Black motherhood dream.\n\nAnd, furthermore, Harris-Perry suggested Cottle read up on some Black feminist literature to grasp the concept.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Michelle Obama never self-identified as a feminist, leaving her defenders to make generous interpretations of her activism and by extension, her politics. As some of her supporters may say, she\u2019s doing the work, even if she doesn\u2019t say as such.\n\nSo should First Lady Chirlane McCray expect the same dubious reception from white feminists? Probably not at first. One key difference between the two First Ladies is that New Yorkers have elected a mayor whose wife has actually called herself a feminist. McCray has the bona fides of being a part of the legendary Combahee River Collective (CRC) of 1974 to 1980, whose foundational statement has shaped Black feminism to this day\u2014including almost every idea in those books Dr. Harris-Perry suggested to Obama-critic Cottle.\n\nAnd in many ways, First Lady McCray is a living example of the maturation of the CRC\u2019s ideas. Several commentators note that McCray\u2019s experience as a lesbian who went on to marry a man of another race reflects the realities of sexual fluidity and family composition in contemporary U.S. society. (Writer Liz Dwyer went so far as to thank New Yorkers for sending a family that looks like hers to the mayoral mansion.) As much as some of us on the Left love feet-in-the-streets action and calling out the political status quo, it\u2019s also a thrill to have a Combahee River Collective member\u2014someone from \u201cour\u201d team\u2014make it to the highest floors of local power, even if she got there because she\u2019s married to the man elected mayor.\n\nNor was McCray incidental to de Blasio\u2019s victory. She\u2019s acknowledged to be his chief advisor and is commonly credited with shaping the platform that got him elected: opposition to the last 20 years of administrations that were overly friendly to business and vicious toward working-class and poor people. It\u2019s clear McCray is one-half of a political team (which I\u2019ll affectionately call \u201cBillane\u201d).\n\nLefties are hopeful McCray and her husband will inscribe \u201cour\u201d message of desperately needed racial, gender and economic equity into city policy. As the Combahee River Collective statement famously noted, these issues not only intersect, they\u2019re interlocked:\n\nWe \u2026 often find it difficult to separate race from class from sex oppression because in our lives they are most often experienced simultaneously. \u2026 We realize that the liberation of all oppressed peoples necessitates the destruction of the political-economic systems of capitalism and imperialism as well as patriarchy.\n\nAnd indeed, many of de Blasio\u2019s campaign promises\u2014such as ameliorating \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policing, guaranteeing a living wage and quelling the affordable housing crisis\u2014would combat all three forms of oppression. Black people and Latinos are disproportionately affected by stop-and-frisk, disproportionately represented in the low-wage workforce\u2014which has swelled during the economic meltdown\u2014and disproportionately forced out of New York City because they can\u2019t afford to stay here. And gender factors into these problems as well, both in overt ways\u2014women make up 60 percent of low-wage workers\u2014and more subtle ones: When Black women are part of the stop-and-frisk dragnet, they report experiencing sexual harassment from police who sometimes misgender them under the guise of looking for a black male rapist.\n\nSo as the new administration seeks to make good on its promises, it\u2019s more than likely that we will witness how a progressive person\u2014and a progressive Black woman, no less\u2014can take the Combahee statement and apply it in real time and in living color to the notoriously complex establishment that is New York City Hall.\n\nYet even this will not necessarily shield McCray from detractors. She will still have to deal with the unspoken-yet-socially-enforced duty of the First Lady to be a paragon of femininity\u2014risking mainstream criticism if she performs the role inadequately and feminist criticism if she performs it too well. Like Michelle Obama, she will have the difficult task of modeling a loving motherhood that\u2019s still denied to Black women, no thanks to stereotypes like Daniel Moynihan\u2019s \u201cBlack Matriarch\u201d and Reagan\u2019s \u201cWelfare Queen,\u201d which cast Black women as inherently incapable of rearing their own children. Like Michelle Obama, she risks being castigated by some white feminists for doing so.\n\nIt\u2019s not easy to have one\u2019s private life subject to public scrutiny, but it\u2019s even harder when that private life is under strain. Both Michelle Obama and McCray navigate marriages made more difficult by the vicissitudes of public service and politics. A little-acknowledged reality of Michelle Obama\u2019s Mom-In-Chief mantle is that it\u2019s a break for a woman who for years earned more than her husband, maintained a home and reared two daughters, all while her husband pursued a political career. As Barack Obama confesses in his memoir, Dreams of My Father, he was confronted with the reality of how his long absences affected his marriage and family when Michelle told him that she refused to be, as a friend calls it, \u201ca single parent with a ring on her finger.\u201d For their part, \u201cBillane\u201d got a taste of how politics can compromise family life when they faced the choice of whether to interrupt their son\u2019s education in order to move to the mayoral mansion. (In the end, they decided to). Both the McCray-de Blasios and the Obamas have made a set of agreements that help their bonds survive as they strap their marriages into the wild rollercoaster of politics. And the rest of us need to take a lesson from both truths, namely that both are perfectly fine marital, parenting and political arrangements.\n\nBut even as we embrace First Lady McCray\u2018s nontraditional marriage, including her partnership in her husband\u2019s career, I hope we feminists and other progressives\u2014the Collective\u2019s philosophical beneficiaries\u2014don\u2019t buckle her to our romantic ideas of \u201cshoulds and woulds.\u201d In this, we can take an example from McCray herself, who has refrained from using her feminist credentials to cast aspersions on or cudgel Michelle Obama for her expressions of her Black womanhood as First Lady. In our efforts to hold Mayor de Blasio accountable to his campaign-trail promises, we should not subject McCray to our own self-constructed \u201cpurity tests\u201d of what it means to be a \u201cgood feminist.\u201d\n\nI hope, really, that we let First Lady McCray live, both personally and politically. Posing for a gorgeous magazine photo, for example, doesn\u2019t nullify her feminist background and political smarts. More importantly, we may need to let her disappoint us with some decisions made by her husband\u2014and by her, if what is said about her being a part of his hiring decisions is true. Already, there's been progressive backlash over the new administration's decision to place the responsibility of turning around the city\u2019s housing crisis and creating living-wage jobs in the hands of Alicia Glen, a former Goldman Sachs executive who served as liaison with the Bloomberg administration, and its decision to swear in stop-and-frisk\u2019s architect, Bill Bratton, as the new NYPD Commissioner. But instead of trashing McCray\u2019s feminist cred, we need to challenge the hirings themselves. These sore-thumb appointments to de Blasio\u2019s staff force the Left to look at the contradictions that arise when applying one\u2019s progressive politics in real life.\n\n\n\nAs the CRC\u2019s statement says, \u201cTo be recognized as human, levelly human, is enough.\u201d We can extend that courtesy to both of our Black First Ladies.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://inthesetimes.com/article/16173/chirlane_mccray_new_yorks_black_feminist_first_lady", "image": "http://inthesetimes.com/images/made/images/articles/Plaid_McCray_Feminist_Black_First_Lady_500_334_s.JPG", "description": "Can we embrace Chirlane McCray without smothering her?", "title": "What To Expect From New York\u2019s Black Feminist First Lady"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf897\"", "article_summary": "And, furthermore, Harris-Perry suggested Cottle read up on some Black feminist literature to grasp the concept.\nWhile Black women practically celebrated in the streets when Michelle Obama stepped into the role in 2008, some white feminists met the nation\u2019s first Black First Lady with confounding silence.\nIt was mostly Black feminists, like Dr. Brittney Cooper, who had to tell these feminist fearmongers to \u201clean back\u201d from such assertions.\nAnd in many ways, First Lady McCray is a living example of the maturation of the CRC\u2019s ideas.\nProfessor and MSNBC host Dr. Melissa Harris-Perry explained to Cottle that for quite a few Black women, Michelle Obama is a feminist dream:You misunderstand the place that Michelle Obama occupies as the first African American First Lady."}
