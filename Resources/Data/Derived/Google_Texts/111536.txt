Since the implementation of the ACA, hospitals must self-report on five charity-care requirements, including having written charity and emergency care policies, notifying patients of financial assistance policies and limiting charges for patients who qualify for charity care. For this study, BRG assessed compliance rates between 2012 and 2013 at 1,723 340B and non-340B hospitals and found the following:

Compliance with the new ACA charity care requirements improved during this time, but non-compliance with several measures still approaches or exceeds 40 percent of the time for both 340B and non-340B hospitals

Only 37 percent of 340B hospitals reduced their charges for patients eligible for charity care in 2013

Only 60 percent of 340B hospitals regularly notified patients of potential charity care eligibility before collecting payments in 2013

This report is further evidence that the current rules of the 340B program are not aligned with program's original goals of helping improve access to medications for patients at safety net facilities.

"Given the program's original purpose, AIR340B is concerned that 340B hospitals do not have higher compliance with the current charity care requirements as these checks and balances do more to help the needy patients the program was created to help," Silverman said.

The Alliance for Integrity and Reform of 340B (AIR 340B) is a coalition of patient advocacy groups, clinical care providers, and biopharmaceutical innovators and distributors dedicated to reforming and strengthening the 340B program to ensure it directly supports access to outpatient prescription medicines for uninsured or vulnerable patients. www.340Breform.org
