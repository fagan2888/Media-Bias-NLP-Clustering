The Los Angeles Business Federation\u2019s annual poll of its members is just out and the top five concerns of employers are: 1. taxes and fees; 2. transportation; 3. government regulation/compliance; 4. education; and 5. public infrastructure (roads, rail, bridges, waterways, etc.).\n\nBizFed founding CEO Tracy Hernandez told us poll results also apply to Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties because they face the same challenges and operate under the same state tax and regulatory policies. Despite many problems, Southern California still is growing because \u201cwe\u2019re in a global economy,\u201d she said.\n\nThis poll matches data from other areas: On taxes, for example, California nabs the highest state income and sales taxes. Its roads are rated the worst in the country, with $64 billion now slated to be wasted on the high-speed rail. And the recent drought uncovered the state\u2019s long-neglected system of dams and reservoirs, something only partly corrected in 2014 with the passage of Proposition 1, $7 billion for water infrastructure.\n\nA really good finding is that two-thirds of those surveyed are optimistic for business growth in 2016. Yet that\u2019s balanced with a lower number, 41 percent, expecting jobs growth for the year, the same as last year. That\u2019s consistent with businesses trying to get around the sharply higher minimum wage, up from $8 an hour to $10 the last two years, and scheduled to rise to $15 by 2022.\n\nThe disparity is \u201ctied to investing more in technology and durable goods\u201d because of the minimum wage increase, Hernandez explained. \u201cPeople will grow their businesses through automation rather than investing in human capital to increase efficiency in operation. I don\u2019t want it that way, but that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d\n\nCovered California, our state\u2019s implementation of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, negatively impacted 64 percent of businesses.\n\nAccording to the survey, of those businesses leaving the state, 73 percent cited high taxes and fees, 63 percent tagged excessive red-tape regulations and another 63 percent cited high housing costs, which now are the highest in the nation after the Bay Area.\n\nThe BizFed survey is further proof that the state\u2019s high taxes and regulations are transforming the economy from one based to a great extent on labor, to one based on brains and capital investment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite the ongoing recovery, businesses continue to face challenges in Southern California.
