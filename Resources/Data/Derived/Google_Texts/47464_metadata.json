Save the date \u2014 and reserve your table or tickets now so you don\u2019t miss out on this exciting evening for liberty!\n\nMichelle is a New York Times best-selling author, nationally syndicated columnist, wildly successful digital entrepreneur, and Tea Party champion. She was there at the beginning, amplifying what the mainstream media still doesn\u2019t understand about the Tea Party \u2014 that it began and remains the most patriotic, bottom-up, truly grassroots movement to restore Constitutional principles our country has seen in generations.\n\nShe will be joined at Heartland\u2019s 30th anniversary gala by our Master of Ceremonies, The Hon. Joe Walsh. Joe was the greatest champion the Tea Party ever had in Congress. He lived his small-government principles by refusing to accept his taxpayer-funded Congressional health benefits and sleeping in his office. Joe will bring to Heartland\u2019s event the same energy and enthusiasm for liberty he displays every night on the radio in Chicago at AM 560 The Answer.\n\nThe Heartland Institute is most honored by the opportunity to award its 2014 Liberty Prize to M. Stanton Evans \u2014 the legendary conservative journalist and global champion of liberty. He studied under Ludwig von Mises at New York University, and went on to join the staff of William F. Buckley\u2019s fledgling National Review (where he served as associate editor from 1960 to 1973). He later became managing editor of Human Events, where he is currently a contributing editor.\n\nEvans was present at Great Elm, the Buckley family home, at the founding of Young Americans for Freedom \u2014 where on September 11, 1960, he drafted YAF\u2019s charter, the Sharon Statement. Many conservatives still revere this document as a concise statement of their principles. He became a proponent of National Review co-editor Frank Meyer\u2019s \u201cfusionism,\u201d a political philosophy reconciling the traditionalist and libertarian tendencies of the conservative movement.\n\nYou won\u2019t want to miss this night of good food and drink, great speakers, and excellent fellowship and networking opportunities with fellow lovers of liberty \u2014 especially as the 2014 midterm elections draw near. Individual tickets are just $49, but it is best to purchase a table for your Tea Party or non-profit group at a an early-bird discount rate.
