Following the last round of sign-ups, the percentage of uninsured Americans was the lowest on record. We'll likely see those numbers go down more, although officials recently lowered projections about how many Americans would buy coverage this year through the exchanges.\n\nFor those buying new health insurance plans, they are satisfied with the cost of health care, more satisfied than Americans with other health insurance plans. Keep in mind the six percent margin of error for this poll. Because of the margin of error, the previous graphs showed the plans were equal, however, this one shows significant differences in the satisfaction for the cost of health care. Obamacare plans are performing better.\n\n\n\nCourtesy Gallup\n\nMost Americans who obtained insurance last year expect to renew their current policies, another sign that new enrollees are happy about the new system.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Data Mine [News]", "title": "Obamacare Plans Earn High Marks", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "A new Gallup poll shows newly insured Americans are satisfied with their coverage.", "title": "Newly Insured Americans &lt;3 Obamacare", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/11/14/obamacare-plans-earn-high-marks", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/3e/db/e0c09247480f84a3b9f25f8f13eb/fe-da-hearthealth-418jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Obamacare Plans Earn High Marks", "description": "A new Gallup poll shows newly insured Americans are satisfied with their coverage.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Nov. 14, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Lindsey Cook,Affordable Care Act,Pulse,DatamineHealthcare,health,health insurance,health care,health care reform,Gallup,Data Mine [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "A new Gallup poll shows newly insured Americans are satisfied with their coverage."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdefb9\"", "article_summary": "For those buying new health insurance plans, they are satisfied with the cost of health care, more satisfied than Americans with other health insurance plans.\nThe ratings were similar to those of other health insurance plans.\nCourtesy GallupThe national health insurance marketplace opens again on Nov. 15, when more Americans can buy coverage.\nBecause of the margin of error, the previous graphs showed the plans were equal, however, this one shows significant differences in the satisfaction for the cost of health care.\nNearly three-fourths of Americans who bought health insurance through the health exchanges mandated under the Affordable Care Act rated the coverage \"good\" or \"excellent,\" according to a new poll from Gallup."}
