For the past five and a half years she has worked as a health care technician at Central Regional Hospital in Butner, N.C., one of three state psychiatric hospitals. Brandon says that after paying essential bills for the family, she typically has less than $40 left for the month.\n\nThere is nothing unusual about her story. In fact, most of the state\u2019s 15,000 employees at mental health facilities are living at or below the poverty level. An overwhelming number of health care technicians \u2014 82 percent \u2014 are stuck at the bottom of their salary grade, no matter their seniority.\n\nMany have worked in their jobs for five to 10 years but still earn only around $25,000 a year. Like all state employees, they have not had a raise since 2008.\n\nMost have to work second jobs to support their families and meet ever rising living costs. Often these are minimum wage jobs at fast-food restaurants.\n\nAfter working 40 to 60 hours a week cleaning, bathing, walking, entertaining, teaching and providing all the daily tasks required to keep their clients safe and active, the additional 10 to 20 hours at a second job can be more than exhausting. Overwork and fatigue make it very difficult to focus on the essential tasks of caring for those with mental illness.\n\nBonita Johnson, a food service assistant at Murdoch Center, says: \u201cWe make low wages and are expected to buy work clothes and keep lots of white tops clean, with our own money. If we aren\u2019t paid right, we at least want help with our uniforms because we are expected to wear white tops, solid pants, hairnets and nonskid shoes, and are told to stay clean and stain free. At the same time, we are not supplied with funds, aprons or anything else to make these uniforms affordable.\u201d Johnson works a second job at a Chick-fil-A in Wake Forest several evenings each week.\n\nWhen Gov. Pat McCrory refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, he basically left an additional half-million poor people, who have no health insurance, to die. North Carolina could have received up to $16 billion in federal funding for Medicaid expansion over the next five years. McCrory would rather tell state employees and other poor residents to tighten their belts, that the state can\u2019t afford to provide them health coverage.\n\nDespite all this hardship and stress on the workforce, McCrory felt it was necessary to release a memo to Department of Health and Human Services employees in March 2013 saying they all would have to sacrifice, find more efficiencies and expect no pay raises in the foreseeable future. Yet McCrory and DHHS Secretary Aldona Wos somehow found at least $1.7 million to hand out raises to underqualified political appointees within the department.\n\nRecipients of the governor\u2019s generosity include Ricky Diaz and Matthew McKillip, two 24-year-old McCrory campaign staffers who were awarded $85,000 and $87,500 gigs, both at significant pay increases over their predecessors. Joe Hauck, vice president of a company headed by Wos\u2019 spouse, was given a contract capped at $310,000 to \u201creorganize, redirect and restructure the Department,\u201d according to Diaz.\n\nMental health workers\u2019 Bill of Rights\n\nWos claims that Hauck has a plan to save the state $5 million by hiring more permanent nurses in the state facilities. Bringing in more permanent nurses, providing a more stable workforce, will definitely assist in improving patient care and reduce stress among workers. However, in the current climate of low morale and high turnover, this plan is not likely to save any money. Turnover of staff costs the state tens of millions of dollars each year. Since January 2012, turnover at Cherry Hospital in Goldsboro is 40 percent; among registered nurses turnover is 46 percent. Similar turnover rates apply to all state-operated facilities. According to Beverly Moriarty, a registered nurse, workers can\u2019t wait to quit.\n\nThese turnover rates are due to staff cuts, low wages and dangerous work environments. Also driving down morale and driving up turnover are policies on which staff have no input and whose contradictions often put employees in \u201cdamned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t\u201c situations, in the words of former licensed practical nurse Bernice Lunsford. The best way to provide quality care to clients is to create stable jobs and respect workers\u2019 basic rights.\n\nAccording to information from DHHS Human Resources, there are 15 percent fewer filled positions since the so-called Mental Health Reform Plan was adopted in 2001, a reduction of 1,500 jobs. In the last three years alone, 619 positions have been cut (over 7 percent) at the state\u2019s institutions.\n\nEmployees must cover more clients and work more mandatory overtime. They are heavily pressured not to take any vacation or comp time and are placed under increasing stress.\n\nState mental health workers belonging to UE Local 150, North Carolina Public Service Workers Union, have been campaigning since 2008 for a Mental Health Workers\u2019 Bill of Rights. In February, state Rep. Larry Bell (D-Clinton) introduced House Bill 130, which would grant rights to adequate staffing, input on decisions, a safe workplace, the right to refuse excessive overtime, a family-supporting wage and more.\n\nKevin Yancey, UE 150 statewide chief shop steward and youth program assistant, says, \u201cWorkers need a seat at the table so that we can help the administration navigate through a situation that they cannot see.\u201d\n\nThe union\u2019s DHHS Council held a demonstration on Nov. 14 at Dorothea Dix Hospital in Raleigh. Workers demanded that Wos meet with the union, extend Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act and grant workers \u201csafety, rights and raises,\u201d the slogan of their current campaign.\n\nStrobino is a field organizer with UE Local 150.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Durham, N.C. \u2014 Jessica Brandon, a mother of three whose 40-year-old husband has had four heart attacks, is the sole wage earner in her family.
