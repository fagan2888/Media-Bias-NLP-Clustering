They exemplified, the quality and breadth of contribution I see all around our country.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, that I have ample opportunity in this role to ponder our flag. It features at so many occasions. I often imagine the Federation Star placed at the centre of our continent.\n\nI let my mind wander to the myriad people and places, I\u2019ve come to know beyond its seven shining points \u2013 from the red dust, to the beach sands.\n\nThe teachers and leaders of Mer Island in the Torres Strait, achieving exceptional educational outcomes, and pathways to employment, for local Indigenous children.\n\nThe volunteers at the Parramatta Mission offering support, advice, and friendship, to the homeless, the mentally ill, the drug addicted, new migrants, some of them three generations of the one family.\n\nPeople on the fringe trying to find their way in.\n\nVictorian SES workers shoring up homes and lives in Charlton, Rochester and Kerang during the floods, helping people to get to the Community Relief Centre.\n\nThe oyster farmers of Dunalley rebuilding their businesses after being wiped out by the bushfires.\n\nThe intrepid scientists of Australia\u2019s Antarctic Territories researching effects of climate change.\n\nThe carers in Adelaide working to restore the dignity and quality of life for those living with severe disabilities. Cherry Tree Corner is a very special place.\n\nSporting stars and role models in the Clontarf programs in the Pilbara, teaching kids about values, respect, hard work.\n\nJust as much as travelling around our country\u2019s communities, I like bringing people together from all regions and disciplines, and listening to their conversations unfold.\n\nPeople working in the same field, often meet for the first time, when they join in a roundtable discussion, and discover how they can work together.\n\nI\u2019ve hosted several of these during my term.\n\nThey usually arise from conversations with a wide range of professionals from different quarters.\n\nPeople asking the same sorts of questions, looking for a serious dialogue.\n\nThere was the working group on maternal mortality, held in conjunction with CARE Australia.\n\nThe UN Millennium Project was set up to develop a concrete action plan for the world to achieve eight Development Goals, (MDGs), by 2015.\n\nTheir aim is to reverse the grinding poverty, hunger and disease affecting billions of people.\n\nMDG No. 5 calls for universal access to reproductive health services, and a reduction in maternal mortality rates by three quarters \u2013 They are still 15 times higher in developing regions.\n\nI think of the shocking conditions that too many women in Africa face during pregnancy and birthing \u2013 no hospitals, no doctors, no transport to get there.\n\nTheir labours, so often, excruciating and terrifying.\n\nI have learned that for many, their babies die before birth.\n\nGraca Machel and Dr Gertrude Mongella spoke to me in powerful language of the urgency to work harder towards meeting this goal.\n\nThe Group: Experts in family planning, obstetrics and midwifery, post natal care, and nutrition \u2013 convened to discuss what we in Australia can do to encourage and support action.\n\nAnother of these meetings focussed on the work of an organisation I was involved with more than 30 years ago, the Association for the Wellbeing of Children in Healthcare, and its Ward Grandparent Scheme.\n\nTrained mature volunteers spend generous time with children whose parents can\u2019t be with them during long hospital stays away from home.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken about the Puuya women of Lockhart River.\n\nMy gathering with members of the Puuya Foundation was a chance to strengthen relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, and to explore new partnerships to help the Foundation\u2019s future work.\n\nAnother honoured the work of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Elders in preserving Indigenous languages, and to raise awareness of issues faced by ATSI communities in keeping language alive.\n\nThe forum, \u201cCapturing the Benefits of Research in Australia\u201d, organised with Professor Brian Schmidt, our Nobel Laureate, brought together an impressive cohort of sophisticated minds and experienced operators.\n\nThey teased out complex issues around innovation, commercialisation, patent protection, risk management, and the role of government in research.\n\nAustralia\u2019s standing in medical and scientific research is world class.\n\nWe have a robust intellectual resource here that deserves serious recognition and encouragement.\n\nI am fortunate to be briefed by some of our top researchers.\n\nAt the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, I\u2019ve looked into microscopes and seen how cell death is being targeted to cure disease.\n\nAt the Australian Antarctic Division I learned that ice cores drilled from coastal regions of Antarctica, reveal carbon cycle history, and about the links between sea surface temperature changes, and the circulation of the Southern and Indian Oceans.\n\nAt James Cook University, I saw, how, in cases of shock, major blood loss, burns and sepsis, a heart can be stopped for several hours \u2013 to allow it to stabilise \u2013 then re-started.\n\nTruly extraordinary work. But it\u2019s not just about the experts.\n\nI believe strongly that we should be engaging our young people more, in the offerings of these fields of endeavour.\n\nDuring my time in office 75,000 school children have come to Government House.\n\nI talk to them about the scientists I meet, the fantastic projects they\u2019re working on, how maths and science are critical to solving the problems our planet will face in their futures.\n\nIn all of these wide-ranging conversations, we hear one another\u2019s unique stories of accomplishment, service, and selflessness.\n\nAnd in listening and responding, we practise our own versions of citizenship.\n\nWe participate in democracy.\n\nWhilst the Australian Constitution invites revision only in circumstances of thorough consideration and broad consensus, the parliamentary democracy it underpins is fluid.\n\nThe nature of political engagement changes with each generation of citizens.\n\nThe subtleties of executive and prime ministerial power shift, according to the incumbent and the demands of the times.\n\nOur characterisation of the role of Governor-General is influenced in somewhat the same way.\n\nInescapably, the election or appointment of the first woman Prime Minister or Governor-General, is of itself, an evolution.\n\nWe each perform our roles drawing on our own quite different experiences and skills.\n\nFor a position that engages us, with just about every aspect of Australian life, no one can arrive in the job conversant with it all.\n\nThere are always going to be steep learning curves, hesitations, celebration and solemnity, and times when we despair at what we see.\n\nThe real opportunity is to bring Australians along with us, to use what we have to learn more, to allow the stories we exchange to shape the identity of the role, and Australians\u2019 perceptions of it, to strike a balance between observing traditions and protocol, and being thoroughly contemporary.\n\nIn March 2010, I marked the centenary of International Women\u2019s Day. Hundreds of women and men of all ages and pursuits, came together to share stories of women\u2019s toil and triumph, throughout our lifetimes.\n\nFar from a self-congratulatory affair, or one where guests were content to rest on their laurels, the conversations were about who was doing what, and what more needed doing to bring gender equality within our sights.\n\nSignificantly, there is widespread acknowledgement, of the chasm in human rights protection and enjoyment, between women of developed and developing nations.\n\nEven worse, there is a sickening sense of going backwards, particularly in the global movement to end violence against women.\n\nThe exchanges that took place in this forum of hugely diverse and capable women inevitably raised the question of whether and how young women \u201cdo\u201d feminism.\n\nIn the nineteen \u201860s and \u201870s, we had feisty years of public rallies, protests, pickets, bold T-shirt graffiti.\n\nIt was as much about getting our voices heard in the public domain, as the confronting, never-seen-before spectacle of challenging stereotypes.\n\nThere was a need to be noisy and strident to break the silence around women\u2019s lives, and get communities and governments on board for change.\n\nThere were private spaces too where women shared their stories of inequality and discrimination for the first time.\n\nAnd, in doing so, began to build their sense of self-worth, and imagine a more fulfilling future.\n\nNearly half a century on, Australia is a vastly different place.\n\nCertainly, far too many women, still, are absent from senior management, leadership and governance positions across all sectors.\n\nThey are paid less than men for comparable work.\n\nThey bear a disproportionate load in the care of children and the running of households.\n\nAustralian women nonetheless have access to education and opportunities, that women of developing nations aren\u2019t able to foresee for generations hence.\n\nOur laws impose penalties and remedies in response to discriminatory conduct and decision making.\n\nOur Human Rights Commission continues to educate Australians about discrimination, its consequences, how it can be prevented.\n\nAs a result, prejudice and disparity are not as prevalent or overt as they once were.\n\nThese shifts in Australian life must surely mean that the character of social movements must shift too.\n\nAnd my sense is that they are shifting; not only the movements for gender equality, but all of the efforts that endeavour to understand and redress disadvantage.\n\nMore than a decade ago when I was Principal of Women\u2019s College at Sydney University, I saw how young women then were choosing to engage with one another and with the world.\n\nThey came from varied circumstances of wealth and disadvantage, though they shared the privilege of a first-rate education. I keep in touch with them. They are all women who believe in feminist principles.\n\nAs they set off in their careers, I notice a different sort of expression of that belief.\n\nTheir voices have come off the streets and into their homes and workplaces.\n\nTheir focus has largely shifted from the public domain to the more private realm of relationships with partners, friends and colleagues.\n\nThey volunteer as role models and mentors.\n\nThey donate their skills rather than money.\n\nThey are adept networkers and social media users.\n\nThey share their experiences of progress and frustration online and around boardroom tables.\n\nThis \u201ceveryday activism\u201d is leading by doing; understanding and responding through lived experience.\n\nAnd it\u2019s especially suited to the times.\n\nInequality, discrimination and suffering may be less visible, but they are real and complex and widespread.\n\nYet individuals now have the greatest potential ever to drive change.\n\nStories have traction on the ground and across the virtual world.\n\nThe internet offers a convenient and cheap platform for launching ideas to a massive audience.\n\nIt\u2019s estimated that there\u2019s up to 200 million blogs worldwide.\n\nStorytelling in the digital era is a powerful means of bringing the private and disparate into the public gaze.\n\nWhat I describe here is timeless too.\n\nIt\u2019s the same sort of leadership and citizenship that I saw practised by my parents in a bush town not long after the Second World War.\n\nIt\u2019s what those women did when they testified at the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna.\n\nOnly now, we use more sophisticated tools, and we have a duty to handle them carefully.\n\nGreg Jericho\u2019s account of the Australian blogosphere and citizen journalism, The Rise of the Fifth Estate, lists an impressive 324 Australian political blogs.\n\nThese are commentators and activists operating outside the constraints of mainstream media, inviting moderated reader participation.\n\nThey are what their creators want them to be, and as such, are vulnerable to prejudice, partisanship, and human peccadillos.\n\nNonetheless, they have a huge following and are enormously influential in shaping the views of Australians.\n\nJericho reports that less than 20% of the listed blogs are written by women, and only another 10% are co-authored by men and women,noting that these figures pretty well mirror women\u2019s representation in our parliament and on our corporate boards.\n\nHe describes the nature of political discussion in the blogosphere as combative, aggressive, and as the numbers show, dominated by men.\n\nHe says women have confessed to posting as men to avoid personal attack with sexual overtones.\n\nWe should remember that in our personal interactions with people who know us, we are careful to observe the etiquette of respectful and constructive communication.\n\nWhereas online dialogue with strangers can unleash the most offensive behaviours with impunity.\n\nIf it is the case that women choose to bypass the blogosphere as a site for their political activism, so be it.\n\nIf however, the nature of debate as described is effectively excluding them from participating, the issue deserves the same attention as the paucity of female representation in senior leadership.\n\nYoung Australians under the age of 25 are by far the greatest Internet users.\n\nThere are Internet platforms that allow them to participate freely in discussion without being judged by their peers or elders.\n\nThough, as is too often the case, access and opportunity are denied to those who can\u2019t afford to pay for it.\n\nWhen I ask young people about how they want to participate, whether in virtual or physical spaces, they say they\u2019re looking to be involved in a dialogue. They\u2019re not interested in being talked at. They want a genuine opportunity to respond. This is the idea of citizenship as communication. Talking as a way of doing.\n\nWhere ideas and action emerge from young people\u2019s everyday experiences and conversations.\n\nIf we agree with Aristotle that our task as citizens is not only to avoid injustice, but to live and behave well, then we have a responsibility to connect with young people in a way that makes sense in their lives, and respects their equal right to participate.\n\nAnd I believe no differently of our ageing and elderly.\n\nPatricia Edgar, in her new book, In Praise of Ageing, writes of the myths and stereotypes we have succumbed to around the business of getting older.\n\nThat the old get sick, and are a drain on the rest of society.\n\nThat we don\u2019t understand technology.\n\nThat old people are a separate life form that renders us invisible.\n\nThat we don\u2019t mind being called \u201cdear\u201d, or \u201clove\u201d, or \u201cdarling\u201d instead of our real name.\n\nWe don\u2019t care about work anymore, and we\u2019re not interested in furthering our careers.\n\nEdgar acquaints us with some of the facts.\n\nAustralia has one of the highest proportions of centenarians in the world.\n\nBy 2050, the number of Australians aged 85 and over will increase to 1.8 million, 5% of the population.\n\nBaby boomers can expect to live to 90.\n\nEdgar concludes that our medical system has effectively deemed 70 to be the age, when public expenditure on regular cancer check-ups is no longer cost effective.\n\nShe argues that ageing is unfairly blamed for increases in health expenditure, and that obesity, having doubled in the last 20 years, is a far worthier culprit.\n\nEdgar\u2019s rejoinder is that at age 70 we are perfectly capable of learning new skills,\n\nAnd making a valuable contribution to the economy and society, and plenty of us do.\n\nA broader definition of productivity is urged: where real value is attributed to the volunteer and caring roles that act as the glue binding families and communities.\n\nI know that for myself, when my term concludes, I\u2019m looking forward to returning to the grassroots of my earlier years. Reconnecting.\n\nWorking with organisations that I hope will benefit from my skills.\n\nMy friends, Australia is home to more than 23 million people.\n\nWe are a wealthy country, politically stable, with continuing prosperity, and solid economic growth.\n\nUnemployment is low, our social security system well established.\n\nWe have widespread access to quality health care and education.\n\nWe have confidence in our military, police, and emergency services to deal with potential threats and complex situations.\n\nWe are known for our capacity to get through tough times, and to become collectively stronger, when challenges beset whole communities.\n\nFlood, fire, drought.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken before about what I\u2019ve observed in Australians who face these devastating events.\n\nThe idea of neighbourhood and neighbourliness being the foundation of community and social capital.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures have endured for at least 40,000 years.\n\nIn the last 40 years, immigration to Australia has accounted for about half our population growth.\n\nToday, over 20% of Australians were born overseas; more than half came to Australia from non-English speaking countries, in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and South America.\n\n14% aged five and over speak a language other than English at home.\n\nWe are a society whose citizens are committed to the institutional framework of our nation\u2019s parliamentary democracy and we do well to respect and preserve the cultural heritages meaningful in our personal lives.\n\nIt is the vigorous nature of this diversity that enhances our resilience, and helps us to keep evolving and maturing as a society, a nation and a worthy international citizen.\n\nIt\u2019s how we ensure that society is in a fit state to hand on to our children and grandchildren.\n\nIt\u2019s how we engender their respect for our legacy.\n\nBut none of this happens of its own accord.\n\nIt requires our honest acknowledgement that many aspects of Australian life still demand our serious attention.\n\nAnd it requires belief, will and action, by individuals, communities, and governments.\n\nOur population is growing due to migration and people living longer, increasingly in outer metropolitan areas.\n\nThere\u2019s pressure on resources and infrastructure, housing, transport systems, safety.\n\nFamily life is shifting.\n\nThere\u2019s a greater variety of family forms and arrangements.\n\nWe\u2019re having fewer children, more of us are living alone.\n\nInternet and social media technologies are altering the way we work and communicate with one another, how we conduct our relationships.\n\nWe\u2019re feeling our way for a balance between the opportunity and freedom they offer, and the social withdrawal and divide they warn.\n\nAnd with these changes, persistent challenges remain.\n\nClosing the gap on indigenous disadvantage.\n\nEnsuring that Australians living with a disability are protected.\n\nKeeping our welfare system in pace with society\u2019s need for a safety net.\n\nSupporting families affected by mental illness, alcohol, drug and gambling addiction, violence, poverty, homelessness, child abuse.[vi]\n\nWe\u2019ve made valuable inroads into these very tough problems.\n\nThink of the nation-changing efforts of Dr Patrick McGorry in mental health reform and destigmatising mental illness.\n\nBut we must keep working on all of these issues.\n\nOur children and grandchildren will become the custodians of the Australia we are shaping now. In their hands they will reshape it, according to their own vision and aspirations.\n\nIn advancing a fairer Australia I ask you to imagine a nation:\n\nThat takes care of our neighbourhoods and our neighbours, in our suburbs, our towns, our cities and our region.\n\nThat embraces the power and promise of new technologies without sacrificing courtesy, civility and respect.\n\nThat fosters courage, compassion and resilience.\n\nThat regards giving as a natural part of living.\n\nThat praises accomplishment, service and selfnessness\n\nThat understands that human stories and their telling are powerful agents of learning, leadership and change\n\nIt\u2019s okay for the personal to be political.\n\nMy friends, In our imagining, I suggest a nation:\n\nWhere an ethic of care guides the way we lead.\n\nWhere the young, the elderly, the indigenous, the newly arrived, people with disabilities are treated with dignity and respect, and able to be the best and healthiest they can be.\n\nWhere every child is given the opportunity of a good education from their very early years.\n\nWhere women\u2019s contributions to civil society, the workplace, the economy, the family and home are valued equally with men\u2019s.\n\nWhere streets, homes, schools, women and girls are spared violence.\n\nWhere people are free to love and marry whom they choose.\n\nAnd where, perhaps, my friends, one day, one young girl or boy may even grow up to be our nation\u2019s first head of state.\n\nThis is the last of four Boyer lectures by Governor-General Quentin Bryce.
