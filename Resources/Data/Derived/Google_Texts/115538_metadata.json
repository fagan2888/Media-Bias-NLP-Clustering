Most notably, Democrats were able to beat back riders blocking enforcement of the Labor Department\u2019s fiduciary rule and the NLRB\u2019s more expansive new joint employer standard. The joint employer rider was thought to stand a strong chance of inclusion because it had some Democratic support, particularly in the House.\n\nThe joint employer rider\u2019s absence is a big loss for business lobbyists because it leaves them few other avenues to thwart it. Now the scene shifts to New York City, where on Jan. 11 the NLRB resumes proceedings against McDonald\u2019s over whether the company is jointly liable for franchisees\u2019 alleged retaliation against fast food protesters in 2012. (The board is also investigating joint employer-based allegations at Papa John\u2019s and Panera, but so far no complaints have been filed).\n\nSlow Cadillac: Unions and manufacturers won a two-year delay of the so-called Cadillac Tax, the Affordable Care Act\u2019s 40 percent excise tax on expensive health plans. The big question now: will the Cadillac Tax ever be enacted? After all, \u201ca piece of legislation once delayed can certainly be delayed again,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Nancy Cook writes. \u201cIt may never see the light of day - especially since both the Democratic and Republican candidates running for the White House have all proposed scrapping the Cadillac tax - though the Republicans want to get rid of the rest of Obamacare too.\u201d\n\n\"Whoever is in the White House next, from our perspective, has a better view on the tax,\" one union official told POLITICO.

Unions oppose the raise because they fear it will slow job and wage growth. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on Tuesday urged the Fed not to act, saying \u201ctoo many working people are not feeling the economic recovery because of stagnant wages.\u201d\n\nArguing against a rate increase in Vox, Matt Yglesias underscores its potential impact on marginalized workers like African Americans, whose unemployment rate is twice the rate for white Americans. \u201cIf white unemployment goes from 10 percent to 5 percent,\u201d Yglesias writes, \u201cthe Fed has achieved a 5 percentage point reduction. At the same time, we would expect black unemployment to fall from 20 percent to 10 percent \u2014 a much larger 10 percentage point reduction. With the United States currently enjoying a lowish 5 percent unemployment rate, it's easy for relatively privileged people to neglect the benefits of further small reductions. But for an African-American population that will enjoy a double-scale version of any drop in the unemployment rate, the stakes remain quite high.\u201d http://bit.ly/225snN7\n\nFor the economy more generally, some economists say a small raise won\u2019t do too much damage. \u201cWith recent assurances from Yellen that the central bank will exercise extreme care, growing numbers of Wall Street analysts now believe that a gentle hike of just a quarter of a percentage point will not be necessarily bad news for markets, and could even provide a short-term stimulus if businesses are inspired to invest in new equipment now rather than wait for higher rates in the future,\u201d POLITICO\u2019s Jon Prior and Ben White report. \u201cFor traders, a rate hike is assumed. The Fed failing to move would likely cause a much bigger reaction on Wall Street.\u201d http://politico.pro/1TOC1xO\n\nTODAY: MORE ON PORTABLE BENEFITS: Labor Secretary Tom Perez and Sen. Mark Warner, (D-Va.), discuss \u201cportable benefits for independent workers\u201d at the Aspen Institute this afternoon. The discussion comes weeks after a group of tech CEOs, liberal groups and some labor leaders called for legislation establishing traveling benefits for temporary and independent contract workers. http://bit.ly/1YfDNPa\n\nAFL-CIO WILL SUE OVER ILLINOIS RIGHT-TO-WORK ZONE: The Illinois AFL-CIO Tuesday vowed to sue the Chicago suburb of Lincolnshire after the town\u2019s council voted this week to institute a \u201cright-to-work\u201d zone within its confines. Lincolnshire is the first Illinois town to implement such an ordinance in the state, following through on a call from Republican state Gov. Bruce Rauner. \u201cThe city of Lincolnshire was notified that the vote was illegal, they moved forward with adopting the ordinance anyway, so we'll move forward to take legal action,\" Illinois AFL-CIO President Michael Carrigan told the AP\u2019s Ivan Moreno. http://bit.ly/1I7RLeT\n\nTRUMP CHALLENGES UNION VOTE AT VEGAS HOTEL: The Trump International Hotel Las Vegas is challenging a union election of employees who last week voted to join the UNITE Here affiliated Culinary Workers Union Local 226 and Bartenders Union Local 165. The company filed objections to the election on Monday, according to the case\u2019s NLRB docket . \"We are not surprised that Trump Las Vegas management have filed objections to the outcome of a free and fair union representation election won by their workers who want a union,\" Geoconda Arguello-Kline, Secretary-Treasurer of the Culinary Union, said in a statement . \"Trump Hotel Las Vegas managers have been accused by the federal government of violating labor laws. They want to avoid hearing Donald Trump utter his trademark 'You're fired'.\"\n\nThe union must still bargain with the union despite its objections to the election, according to UNITE Here.\n\nBOEING SEIZES ON MACHINISTS\u2019 BOTCHED DELTA CAMPAIGN: Last April the International Association of Machinists pulled out of a representation bid at Delta after disclosing that many union authorization cards collected from company workers bore questionable signatures. Now, as the union tries to organize Boeing\u2019s North Charleston, S.C. plant, Boeing is mailing a 20-page brochure suggesting the union committed fraud at Delta.\n\n\u201cThe story of the IAM\u2019s recent campaign to unionize the Delta Air Lines flight attendants is a cautionary tale of how a union can misuse your personal information for its own gain,\u201d the company told workers on its Facebook page. \u201cWe believe that our teammates and their families deserve to know the facts about the Machinists Union that is actively campaigning to represent them.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo fraud charges were filed and the National Mediation Board, a federal agency that governs labor relations at airlines, has not cited the IAM for any improper behavior,\u201d the Post and Courier\u2019s David Wren reports . \u201cThe union has said it plans to continue recruiting Delta flight attendants and file for another election in 2016.\u201d\n\nMCCONNELL: TPP TIMING IN OBAMA\u2019S HAND: It\u2019s still up in the air whether Congress will vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement next year, but neither McConnell nor House Speaker Paul Ryan ruled out that possibility during separate interviews at a Politico Playbook Breakfast event on Tuesday.\n\nMcConnell seemed to dial back comments he made last week to the Washington Post, when he cast doubt on whether the deal could pass in 2016. But he suggested Obama would be taking a gamble if he submits TPP to Congress before the election, since all of the Democratic candidates for president and many of the Republican candidates oppose the agreement.\n\n\"If the president wants to succeed, he ought to take into account the reality of the political situation,\" McConnell said. \"It's up to him to decide whether to initiate the process.\"\n\nCOFFEE BREAK\n\n\u2014 \"SEIU Endorses Duckworth,\" from Alton Daily News: http://bit.ly/1O407A0\n\n\u2014 Where did the OUR Walmart campaign go wrong?, from In These Times: http://bit.ly/1JamSBl\n\n\u2014 \u201cUber Seeks Halt Of Drivers' Class Action To Await Appeal,\u201d from Law360: http://bit.ly/225uII1\n\n\u2014 Workers strike at Mexican border factory, from Fronteras Desk: http://bit.ly/1Qnz0XJ\n\n\u2014 Nexteer workers vote on second contract, from Detroit Free-Press: http://detne.ws/1ZblSGf\n\n\u2014 Bangor improves minimum wage hike, from Portland Press-Herald: http://bit.ly/1NSdiIJ\n\n\u2014 10th Circ. rules for immigrant ranch worker in FLSA case, from Law360: http://bit.ly/1NSdtno [Full decision here: http://1.usa.gov/1NvTSWu ]\n\n\u2014 Dems ask DOL to investigate El Super, from the Hill: http://bit.ly/1O7zrET\n\nTHAT\u2019S ALL FOR MORNING SHIFT.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Cadillac Tax delayed \u2014 Agencies avoid cuts", "title": "Omnibus edition: Dems block riders", "url": "http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-shift/2015/12/omnibus-edition-dems-block-riders-cadillac-tax-delayed-agencies-avoid-cuts-211796", "image": "http://static.politico.com/97/de/e15842c94e928ce8b561e20745a0/whitelogoondots.jpeg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Cadillac Tax delayed \u2014 Agencies avoid cuts", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b8a\"", "article_summary": "Omnibus edition: Dems block ridersWith help from Marianne LeVine and Adam BehsudiBREAKING OVERNIGHT: $1.1 Trillion omnibus bill released \u2026 View it here.\n\u201cIf white unemployment goes from 10 percent to 5 percent,\u201d Yglesias writes, \u201cthe Fed has achieved a 5 percentage point reduction.\nWith the United States currently enjoying a lowish 5 percent unemployment rate, it's easy for relatively privileged people to neglect the benefits of further small reductions.\nStory Continued Below\u2014 Labor-HHS summary from Senate Republicans: http://bit.ly/1RRb264\u2014 General summary from House Democrats: http://bit.ly/1YjvpJ5DEMS BLOCK RIDERS: The proposed $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill released early Wednesday morning by congressional Republicans lacks several contemplated riders targeting President Obama\u2019s workplace agenda.\nThe joint employer rider\u2019s absence is a big loss for business lobbyists because it leaves them few other avenues to thwart it."}
