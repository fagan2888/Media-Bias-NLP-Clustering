Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.\n\nLAS VEGAS\u2014The Nevada Democratic Party had just awarded half of its delegates to Miss Piggy.\n\nJim Newell Jim Newell is a Slate staff writer.\n\nOn the eve of the first Democratic debate, the party was hosting a mock caucus to train precinct workers at its offices in Las Vegas. Thirty-five local volunteers took part in the program and were remunerated with pizza for their time. Things might have gotten a little frisky had the party used real candidates for its demonstration\u2014a party training exercise is not the right venue for a war of words over Hillary Clinton versus Bernie Sanders\u2014so instead it opted for characters from The Muppets. After the first ballot, 15 participants had gone with Miss Piggy (an assertive leader) while eight caucused for Kermit the Frog. \u201cUncommitted\u201d took eight\u2014twice as many as the irreverent Fozzie Bear, who was deemed unviable for the next round. Piggy was the victor and scooped up the lion\u2019s share of proportionally allotted delegates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAfter the event, Nevada Democratic Party chairwoman Roberta Lange gave the group more information about the demographic makeup of the delegates it would send to the convention. The party\u2019s goal, she said, is to send seven black, nine Hispanic, one Native American, three Asian and Pacific Islander, four LGBTQ, five disabled, and 12 \u201cyouth\u201d representatives to express the diversity of Nevada Democrats\u2014one that closely resembles the national Democratic coalition that took shape under President Obama\u2019s stewardship.\n\nThat\u2019s why Democrats in Nevada, which is already the third state to select its delegates, think they should lead the Democratic primary process: They\u2019re more representative of the contemporary party base than their Democratic counterparts in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of a harbinger for what\u2019s happening in the West,\u201d Rep. Dina Titus, whose district represents much of Las Vegas, said in her thick twang. \u201cAnd our population is so heterogeneous\u2014fastest-growing Asian population, big Hispanic population\u2014our face is the face of America. So what we\u2019re saying here is what the rest of the country\u2019s thinking.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid, as he is known to do, put the pitch for Nevada a bit more curtly Monday night. Speaking with the Washington Post\u2019s Paul Kane at an MGM Grand gathering, Reid declared that if \u201cyou go to New Hampshire, there aren\u2019t any minorities there, nobody lives there. You go to Iowa, and there are a few people there. But again, it is a place that does not demonstrate what America is all about, for a lot of different reasons.\u201d Reid has never much cared about hurting people\u2019s feelings, and now that he\u2019s retiring, he really doesn\u2019t care. You could see the delight in his face the following day when, at a pre-debate press conference at the Wynn, he answered New Hampshire Democrats\u2019 call for an apology: \u201cNew Hampshire is heavily populated and loaded with minorities,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cSo I apologize.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nReid himself knows that the state\u2019s high percentage of Hispanics\u2014nearly 28 percent of the population, compared with the 17 percent national average\u2014can sway the state one way or another. Despite horrible approval ratings, Reid\u2019s 2010 re-election campaign was able mobilize the state\u2019s Hispanic voters through his push for the Dream Act and, later, immigration reform.\n\nNevada will test whether Sanders can drain Clinton\u2019s strong leads among minority voters.\n\nNevada\u2019s Democratic power fuses new demographic advantages with a more traditional element of the party base: labor unions. Workers along the Strip and Las Vegas\u2019 greater tourist industry are well-organized, in spite of the state\u2019s right-to-work law. The Culinary Workers Union Local 226 boasts more than 55,000 members in Nevada and is now locked in a fight to organize workers in one of Las Vegas\u2019s tallest hotels: the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas.\n\nTrump\u2019s very tall, very classy, very fake-golden-looking footprint in Vegas lorded over the nearby Wynn, which was hosting the Democratic debate, fulfilling Trump\u2019s every dream. Unfortunately for him, the Culinary Workers are smart, and they recognized that it could be useful to have a big protest rally outside his hotel while most of the country\u2019s political reporters were in town\u2014as well as the Democratic front-runner.\n\nFor Hillary Clinton, the opportunity to appear at a rally outside Donald Trump\u2019s hotel with a powerful union that represents many Hispanic workers and whose endorsement might be handy was worth interrupting her debate prep. \u201cMr. Trump says, \u2018Make America great again,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cWell, the Trump workers say, \u2018Start here.\u2019 \u201d Well, it\u2019s the appearance that counts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nClinton barely won the Nevada caucus vote in 2008. (It was her only caucus win in a campaign that infamously blew off caucus states in its nomination strategy.) It\u2019s hard to see how she would lose it this time. A CNN/ORC poll released this week showed Clinton leading Sen. Bernie Sanders 50 to 34 percent in Nevada; when Vice President Joe Biden isn\u2019t included, she shoots to 58 percent to Sanders\u2019 36. Like the South Carolina primary that follows, Nevada\u2019s will test the biggest question mark in this race: whether Sanders, or anyone else, can drain Clinton\u2019s strong leads among minority voters.\n\nIf Clinton can maintain those advantages, and earn the backing of Nevada\u2019s labor unions, she\u2019ll run away with the third voting state. According to the campaign\u2019s Nevada spokesman, Clinton has 22 paid staff and 3,200 volunteers spread across its Reno and Las Vegas offices. Clinton has also been making friendly (if not entirely convincing) overtures to labor in recent weeks, calling for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on pricy health care plans and coming out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the Culinary Workers\u2019 endorsement she received Wednesday. But Clinton was able to announce a separate union endorsement at a training facility for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades in Henderson, Nevada. After taking a tour of the facility, smiling politely as craftspeople shared the knowledge of their trade, Clinton\u2014backed by a dozen or so trainees, who may or may not have been eager to participate\u2014gave a brief speech outlining the economic message she\u2019s tailored for Nevada. Noting that the Las Vegas region was the \u201cepicenter of the mortgage crisis and the foreclosure crisis\u201d from which it\u2019s still, slowly, recovering, Clinton segued to the need for skilled jobs properly organized under labor unions. \u201cI\u2019m feeling really lucky in Las Vegas,\u201d she said. \u201cLast night was a good night, and today is just as good\u2014getting the endorsement from this union.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The Las Vegas debate was good for Clinton.
