That plantation, in the Yellowwood State Forest, has been quarantined by state officials.\n\nThe fungus affects many types of walnut trees, but it is lethal within a few years to black walnut trees, a valued tree that in addition to producing richly flavored nuts is used for flooring, millwork and veneer for furniture.\n\nAlthough the two trees where the weevils were found aren\u2019t infected with the disease, State Entomologist Phil Marshall said officials are keeping a close eye on that plantation and surrounding black walnut trees for signs of infection.\n\nHe said the discovery of the fungus on the weevil marks the first time that pathogen has been detected on an insect other than the walnut twig beetle, which transmits the disease.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a serious situation, but it\u2019s a matter of very important concern. We\u2019ve found it and we\u2019ve found something unusual and different from what is known about this disease complex right now,\u201d said Marshall, director of the state Department of Natural Resources\u2019 division of entomology and plant pathology.\n\nHe said the DNR, the U.S. Forest Service and Purdue University are conducting additional studies at the plantation to better understand the disease and the insects there. The fungus was discovered during a survey for insect pests and fungi in Indiana and Missouri led by the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nIndiana now joins Maryland, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia among the eastern and central states where the disease has been found. It has also been found in eight western states \u2014 Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington.\n\nThe DNR said Indiana has an estimated 31.5 million black walnut trees, which are often grown in plantations, but are also common in the state\u2019s urban and rural forests.\n\nAbout 17.7 million board feet of black walnut valued at about $21.4 million is harvested annually in Indiana, the agency said. Losing the state\u2019s black walnut trees to the fungus would deliver a $1.7 billion economic blow to the state, the DNR said.\n\nIndiana ranked fourth in the nation in the volume of cubic feet of black walnut lumber it produced in 2004, said Elizabeth Jackson at Purdue University\u2019s Hardwood Tree Improvement & Regeneration Center.\n\nJackson, who\u2019s also executive director of the National Walnut Council, said the wood from black walnut trees is highly prized for its grain pattern and its rich color.\n\n\u201cIt has a deep chocolate color that\u2019s been valued by consumers for many decades,\u201d she said. \u201cThe trees\u2019 value to the wood industry is phenomenal.\u201d\n\nThe trees also produce the protein-rich nuts that are an important food source for wildlife and are savored by humans.\n\nIndiana residents can help prevent the spread of forest pests and disease such as thousand cankers disease by avoiding moving firewood or other wood products with bark, Jackson said.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.
