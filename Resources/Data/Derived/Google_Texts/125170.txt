Don't let tax season stress you out

If the thought of doing your taxes is taxing on you, you're not alone.

Experts said next week's tax deadline will be one of the most stressful days of the year.

"They're stressed," said accountant Bill Koscinski, describing last minute filers coming through his office.

Koscinski said he too is stressed, and also frustrated. Every year, his office on N. 13th Street in Allentown is bombarded with last minute filers, expecting to have their documents submitted on time.

The accountant said one item in particular is causing extra anxiety for his clients this year.

"Everyone is pointing at the health care issues. I think the stressful thing about that, is people don't understand what is involved with it," Koscinski.

Overall, Koscinski said it's been more worry than trouble.

But, he anticipates more confusion surrounding the Affordable Care Act next season.

Back to this year, he said some filers, especially those with investment earnings, may want to consider applying for an extension.

He also encourages taxpayers to start early in 2016.

"Be more on top of it next year," Koscinski said.

He said that alone should relieve quite a bit of stress.

But for those who didn't heed that advice this year, Allentown's Massage Envy Spa is offering a helping hand.

The business will provide free 10 to 15 minute chair massages at H&R Block on Hamilton Blvd in Trexlertown on Monday.



They anticipate focusing on specific stress areas.



"Problem areas are definitely going to be in the back and shoulders and the neck. A lot of tension arises in those areas," said Andrea Cole, manager at Massage Envy Spa.
