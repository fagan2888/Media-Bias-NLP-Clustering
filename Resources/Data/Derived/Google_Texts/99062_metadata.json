They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Any truth to that?\n\nJON GREENBERG, POLITIFACT: Well, I think the issue here is that Hillary Clinton said there was a video being produced. And the problem is not the Clinton campaign nor anybody else can point to a video. So there was an article that the Clinton campaign talked about which had some people saying that ISIS was referring to Donald Trump, but no mention of a video. The people who really do track this stuff say, you know, if Donald Trump had shown up in an ISIS video, lots of people would be talking about it. And nobody was talking about it. So in the absence of evidence, we really have no choice but to say this is false.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Okay. In the Q and A over gun control, Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley accused Mrs. Clinton of flip-flopping. Let\u2019s take a listen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMARTIN O\u2019MALLEY (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Secretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems. Having one position in 2000, and then campaigning against President Obama and saying we don\u2019t need federal standards.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Now she said that\u2019s not true. who is right here?\n\nJON GREENBERG: To be precise, in 2000, she was pushing hard. and she was talking about having photo identification licenses for all gun owners. And then in 2008, she backed off and said no, we don\u2019t need that kind of licensing.\n\nHowever, the important thing is you got to key in O\u2019Malley saying no federal standards. Clinton has never backed way from having federal standards. So that part of his claim is inaccurate. But you can find that Hillary Clinton has shifted her position a bit on gun control over the years.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: OK. Finally, Senator Bernie Sanders, who advocates Medicare for everyone, said a single-payer health care system would reduce U.S. healthcare spending. Here\u2019s that.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Why is it that we spend almost three times per capita as to what they spend in the U.K., 50 percent more than what they say \u2013 what they pay in France \u2014 countries that guarantee health care to all of their people \u2013\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: It feels like we\u2019re back a few years ago debating the Affordable Care Act. But is he right?\n\nJON GREENBERG: Well, we don\u2019t know whether or not having a single-payer system would necessarily reduce health care expenditures here in the United States. And we\u2019re not the in prediction business.\n\nOn the other hand, what we can fact check is his basic math, and the numbers there are very clear. In the United Kingdom, we\u2019re looking at about per capita $3,200 U.S. per person. And then in France, it\u2019s about maybe $4,100. Whereas the United States is at $8,700. So if you do the math, Bernie Sanders is correct, and then that\u2019s what we did. So we gave him a true.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Jon Greenberg from Politicfact, joining us from Washington.
