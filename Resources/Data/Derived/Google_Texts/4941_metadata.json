Now, Donald Trump is swaying the vaccine truthers.\n\nOn Thursday, the anti-vaccine website Natural News published an article cheering Trump for being \u201cthe only mainstream presidential candidate who\u2019s spoken out about vaccine-autism dangers.\u201d To be clear, the website is referring to the scientifically unsubstantiated belief that the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) shot can cause autism.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one presidential hopeful currently in the running who has been brave enough to speak out about the link between vaccines and autism, and that candidate is none other than business tycoon Donald Trump,\u201d the article reads.\n\nOn the internet, Natural News is the central hub for vaccine truthers. In comments to ThinkProgress, one science editor described it as a \u201ca one-stop shop \u2026 of virtually every quackery known to humankind, all slathered with a heaping helping of unrelenting hostility to science-based medicine and science in general.\u201d It\u2019s the project of conspiracy theorist Mike Adams, and hosts more than 2 million unique visitors every month. The site boasts more than 1.5 million \u201clikes\u201d on Facebook.\n\nThe site also seems to really like Donald Trump. It specifically lauded a \u201cno-nonsense\u201d 2012 interview the real estate tycoon gave on Fox News, theorizing that the increase in American autism rates was caused by vaccination.\n\n\u201cYou know, I have a theory \u2014 and it\u2019s a theory that some people believe in \u2014 and that\u2019s the vaccinations,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you take a little baby that weighs like 12 pounds into a doctor\u2019s office and they pump them with many, many simultaneous vaccinations \u2026 then lots of different things have happened.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s press office did not respond to ThinkProgress\u2019 request for comment on whether he stood by his 2012 remarks. But Trump has continued to assert that vaccines cause autism since then. In a 2014 tweet storm, he railed against the practice of giving children several vaccinations over a short period of time. \u201cTiny children are not horses,\u201d one tweet read. \u201cThe doctors lied,\u201d read another.\n\nTo be clear, there is no evidence that \u201cthe doctors lied.\u201d The only reason some are making a link between vaccines and autism is because of a study published by disgraced British doctor Andrew Wakefield, which was retracted in 2000, two years after it was published. Even so, vaccine truthers continue use Wakefield\u2019s study to assert the claim, even while scientists have published study upon study ruling out the potential link. None of those subsequent papers have been retracted.\n\nThough vaccine truthers have not been successful at getting a scientific paper published to support their claims, what they have been successful at is literally spreading disease. Research published in JAMA Pediatrics earlier this year found that a rapid measles outbreak linked to Disneyland was caused by a low rate of vaccination, which was \u201cquite possibly a direct consequence of the growing anti-vaccination movement in the United States.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The real estate mogul just secured a favorable review from the vaccine truther site Natural News.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The real estate mogul just secured a favorable review from the vaccine truther site Natural News.", "title": "Prominent Vaccine Denier Site Applauds Trump For Saying Vaccines Cause Autism", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/09/03/3698286/vaccine-truthers-love-donald-trump/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/03103052/Trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The real estate mogul just secured a favorable review from the vaccine truther site Natural News.", "creator": "@@emorwee", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/03103052/Trump-321x214.jpg", "title": "Prominent Vaccine Denier Site Applauds Trump For Saying Vaccines Cause Autism", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/03103052/Trump.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/03103052/Trump.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-03T10:36:10+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/emorweee"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7d5\"", "article_summary": "Health Prominent Vaccine Denier Site Applauds Trump For Saying Vaccines Cause Autism CREDIT: AP Photo/Mark Humphrey Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at the National Federation of Republican Assemblies.\nNow, Donald Trump is swaying the vaccine truthers.\nEven so, vaccine truthers continue use Wakefield\u2019s study to assert the claim, even while scientists have published study upon study ruling out the potential link.\nOn the internet, Natural News is the central hub for vaccine truthers.\nThe site also seems to really like Donald Trump."}
