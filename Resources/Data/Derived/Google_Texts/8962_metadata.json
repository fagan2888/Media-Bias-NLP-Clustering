He described himself in that speech as a \"redeemed believer in Christ.\"\n\nMikey Weinstein called the general's remarks a \"brutal disgrace.\" Mr. Weinstein is the president of the MRFF. He fired off a nasty letter to the Secretary of Defense calling for the Air Force general to be severely punished. He alleged that airmen were \"utterly disgusted and shocked by the brazenly illicit and wholly unconstitutional, fundamentalist Christian proselytizing recently perpetrated on international television.\"\n\nMr. Weinstein demanded the general be court-martialed and \"aggressively and visibly brought to justice for his unforgivable crimes and transgressions.\"\n\nIf the Military Religious Freedom Foundation thought General Olson was a brutal disgrace, I can only imagine what they must have thought of George Washington, who once prayed at Valley Forge.\n\nIt would be easy to dismiss this guy as a two-bit gadfly. Unfortunately, we cannot. Time and time again, Mr. Weinstein has proven that when he complains about something - the Pentagon responds.\n\nFar too many Christians have been bullied by the Military Religious Freedom Foundation's thuggery. It's time for the Pentagon to put a stop to this nonsense.\n\nIf Mr. Weinstein and his stooges have a problem with the general's televised remarks, maybe they should just change the channel.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Military Religious Freedom Foundation wants a two-star general court-martialed because he spoke about his relationship with God..05/27/2016 3:28:40AM EST.", "author": "Todd Starnes", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The Military Religious Freedom Foundation wants a two-star general court-martialed because he spoke about his relationship with God.", "title": "- Starnes: Radical Group Wants Christian General Court-Martialed for Speaking About God", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2015/05/18/starnes-radical-group-wants-christian-general-courtmartialed-for-speaking-about-god-n2000547", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/5/18/9.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The Military Religious Freedom Foundation wants a two-star general court-martialed because he spoke about his relationship with God.", "title": "- Starnes: Radical Group Wants Christian General Court-Martialed for Speaking About God", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2015/05/18/starnes-radical-group-wants-christian-general-courtmartialed-for-speaking-about-god-n2000547", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/5/18/9.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Starnes: Radical Group Wants Christian General Court-Martialed for Speaking About God, Todd Starnes, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The Military Religious Freedom Foundation wants a two-star general court-martialed because he spoke about his relationship with God.\nMr. Weinstein demanded the general be court-martialed and \"aggressively and visibly brought to justice for his unforgivable crimes and transgressions.\"\nFar too many Christians have been bullied by the Military Religious Freedom Foundation's thuggery.\nIf Mr. Weinstein and his stooges have a problem with the general's televised remarks, maybe they should just change the channel.\nIf the Military Religious Freedom Foundation thought General Olson was a brutal disgrace, I can only imagine what they must have thought of George Washington, who once prayed at Valley Forge."}
