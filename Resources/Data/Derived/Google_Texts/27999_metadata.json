REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\n(Reuters) - Kansas became the first state to ban a common second trimester abortion procedure when Governor Sam Brownback, a Republican, on Tuesday signed into a law an act to halt what lawmakers said are \"dismemberment abortions.\"\n\nThe law that goes into effect on July 1 prohibits the use of dilation and evacuation. The bill says the procedure can result in the fetus being extracted in pieces.\n\nSupporters in Kansas have called the procedure horrifying while women's healthcare groups have said it is considered the safest way to terminate a pregnancy in the second trimester.\n\nThe law allows for the procedure to preserve the life of a pregnant woman or when the mother's health is in serious jeopardy from the pregnancy.\n\nRepublican-controlled Kansas has taken a leading role in imposing restrictions on abortions, with more than 20 measures being enacted since Brownback took office in 2011, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports the right to abortion but whose research is cited by both sides in the debate.\n\nThe procedure is used in about 8 to 9 percent of abortions nationwide and similar bans are being considered in Oklahoma, Missouri and South Carolina, it said. Nearly 90 percent of U.S. abortions take place in the first trimester.\n\nBy Jon Herskovitz", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "abortion, laws, state, kansas, becomes, first, state, ban, second, trimester, abortion", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Kansas became the first state to ban a common second trimester abortion procedure.", "title": "Kansas Becomes 1st State To Ban Second Trimester Abortion Procedure", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/abortion-laws-state-kansas-becomes-first-state-ban-second-trimester-abortion-328426", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/08/abortion-kansas.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kansas became the first state to ban a common second trimester abortion procedure.", "title": "Kansas Becomes 1st State To Ban Second Trimester Abortion Procedure", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/abortion-laws-state-kansas-becomes-first-state-ban-second-trimester-abortion-328426", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/08/abortion-kansas.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/08/abortion-kansas.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-04-08T09:28:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-08T09:28:27-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Kansas became the first state to ban a common second trimester abortion procedure."}, "article_summary": "REUTERS/Stephen Lam(Reuters) - Kansas became the first state to ban a common second trimester abortion procedure when Governor Sam Brownback, a Republican, on Tuesday signed into a law an act to halt what lawmakers said are \"dismemberment abortions.\"\nAn anti-abortion sign is seen as demonstrators march on Market Street during the Ninth Annual Walk for Life West Coast rally.\nSupporters in Kansas have called the procedure horrifying while women's healthcare groups have said it is considered the safest way to terminate a pregnancy in the second trimester.\nThe law allows for the procedure to preserve the life of a pregnant woman or when the mother's health is in serious jeopardy from the pregnancy.\nNearly 90 percent of U.S. abortions take place in the first trimester."}
