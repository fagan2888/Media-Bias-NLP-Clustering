After teaming up with the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation (CBCF) to launch the \u201cDon\u2019t Forget To Check Your Melons\u201d campaign, the Canadian grocery store chain has started adding stickers to all cantaloupes, honeydews, and mini-watermelons. Stickers that feature a link to the campaign\u2019s website and make the fruits look like boobs.\n\n\u201cThe first thing you need to know is that there's no right way or wrong way to check your breasts,\u201d CBCF said in a statement. \u201cYou don't need special tools or techniques; it doesn\u2019t need to be done at a specific time of the month, either. You can do it anytime, anywhere you like.\u201d\n\nAccording to CBCF, one out of every nine women in Canada will develop breast cancer at some point during their lifetime. One out of every 30 women diagnosed with breast cancer will die as a result, making it the second leading cause of cancer death among Canadian women. It is recommended that women (and men) examine their breasts at least once a month. They also encourage regular mammograms for all women over the age of 40, who represent 95 percent of all breast cancer diagnoses in Canada.\n\nCanada launches \"Don't Forget To Check Your Melons\" campaign.
