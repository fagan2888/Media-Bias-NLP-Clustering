Don\u2019t tell that to the crowd packed into Tunnicliff\u2019s Tavern Sunday night.\n\nI was there for the World Cup match between the USA and Portugal. A couple hundred people crowded inside and outside the popular eatery across from D.C.\u2019s Eastern Market. They followed every play. They knew all the players. They cheered whenever we took possession. They moaned and groaned whenever Portugal advanced the ball. And they chanted ... no, they didn\u2019t chant, they ROARED \u201cUSA, USA, USA\u201d when the United States scored. It was one of the most exciting sports events I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnd that was just one of thousands and thousands of viewing parties across the country \u2014 at bars, restaurants, parks, gyms, theaters and private homes. I saw the same enthusiasm at The Dubliner on June 13 for the match between Spain and the Netherlands, and in several sports bars in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn on June 21 for Germany vs. Ghana.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on? Is soccer finally catching on as a popular sport in the United States?\n\nIt sure looks, and sounds, like it. The U.S. team\u2019s 2-1 win over Ghana scored the highest ratings ever for any men\u2019s World Cup game on ESPN. And many Americans weren\u2019t satisfied with watching on television. Americans bought four times as many World Cup tickets as residents of the U.K., where \u201cfootball\u201d is the No. 1 sport, and more Americans actually traveled to Brazil for the World Cup than fans from any other country.\n\nSure, it helps that this is the first World Cup in the Western Hemisphere since the Rose Bowl in 1994, and that Rio is only one hour ahead of the East Coast, so you don\u2019t have to stay up \u2019til the middle of the night to watch. But that alone doesn\u2019t explain America\u2019s sudden fascination with soccer. You also have to factor in the steady growth and success of Major League Soccer since the 1994 games, the success of this year\u2019s team and the fact that most young people today played soccer in grade school or high school. In fact, a recent ESPN survey of Americans ages 12 to 17 ranked soccer neck and neck with baseball in popularity.\n\nYou must admit that there\u2019s one other important factor, too: Soccer games are so much fun to watch. They\u2019re only 90 minutes long, and the action is nonstop: No commercial breaks, no time-outs, no repetitious blah blah blah by color commentators \u2014 just the constant motion and gifted footwork of some of the world\u2019s best, and best-looking, athletes. It\u2019s hard to take your eyes away. It\u2019s intense, but it\u2019s captivating.\n\nNo wonder Americans have such a bad case of World Cup fever. If you haven\u2019t caught it yet, watch Thursday\u2019s match between the USA and Germany, and you will. And don\u2019t worry, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to love baseball, basketball or football any less. You just have to love soccer even more. USA! USA!
