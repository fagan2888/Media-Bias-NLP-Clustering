What caught my eye was a simple advance for an upcoming visit to town by Bible teacher Beth Moore:\n\nFARGO -- When Beth Moore was growing up in Arkadelphia, Ark., her father, who owned the local cinema, required his children to help out in the family business.\n\nIt was her job to hand out samples of popcorn and soda. And sometimes, she would \"slip into the movie and take with her a pickle bag full of popcorn and a Dixie cup of Coke,\" her website notes.\n\n\"There in a theater chair, wide-eyed and filled to the brim with Coca-Cola, Beth began a lifelong love for stories,\" the introduction continues. \"She loved to tell them, write them and be told them.\"\n\nThe story that ultimately captivated her, however, was one about a savior named Jesus who, she discovered, loves her madly.\n\nLots has been written about Beth Moore but I rarely see something this graceful.\n\nWriting a piece on a visiting speaker is one of the more boring tasks a reporter must do, so it\u2019s unusual when a writer actually puts time and care into such a story.
