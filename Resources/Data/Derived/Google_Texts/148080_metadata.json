Sarasota residents waited in lines that stretched a quarter-mile. Even Sarasota\u2019s largest venue was too small for the crowd. Organizers split the 6000 people into two rallies, one inside and one out.\n\nWearing suit jacket, no tie and a red baseball cap pulled low, Trump the billionaire drew big applause for saying he\u2019s free of outside political influence.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody that gave me money,\u201d said Trump. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody that said I\u2019m going to give you a campaign contribution. But if I get elected I\u2019m going to be the ambassador to Italy. There\u2019s none of that going on folks.\u201d\n\nTrump spoke for nearly two hours. Among his targets was Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who is also running for the Republican nomination.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t even warmed up his seat in the Senate,\u201d said Trump\u201d. \u201cHe told you people, ok, I\u2019m gonna this, I\u2019m gonna fight. The seat isn\u2019t even warm and he\u2019s running for another office. And he\u2019s not gonna win because I really believe Trump is gonna win. I really do. I really do.\u201d\n\nTrump promised the Sarasota crowd an end to ObamaCare, a wall on the border with Mexico and lower taxes for all. A half-dozen protesters were escorted peacefully out of the rally.\n\nAn elephant greeted guests at the Robarts Arena front gate while Trump offered helicopter rides for kids around back.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s watch these kids take off,\u201d said Trump. \u201cThey\u2019re all waving and they\u2019re scared stiff.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Government", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump brought his campaign to Florida over the weekend.
