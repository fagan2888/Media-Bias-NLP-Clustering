However, what could have easily devolved into a partisan, Colbert Report-esque throwback became something much more elevated when the host began with a question about the recent death of the politician\u2019s son, Beau Biden.\n\n\u201cI know that he was a great man,\u201d Colbert said after offering his condolences to Biden. \u201cI was hoping you could tell us a story about him.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was an engaging conversation about parenting, death, faith and politics that visibly rendered both men emotionally vulnerable, yet honest. Between Biden\u2019s constant use of a comfortable phrase, \u201cmy dad (or mom) had an expression,\u201d and Colbert\u2019s frank discussion of his own faith, the interview felt more like an actual interview than a talk show promotion.\n\nThis is as good as Biden gets. Also: This is earnest Colbert, someone we never really have gotten to meet, and Biden is letting us meet him. \u2014 Chris Geidner (@chrisgeidner) September 11, 2015\n\nColbert surely the only late-night host who could conduct this wonderful Biden interview. Poignant, probing and funny in just right balance. \u2014 Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) September 11, 2015\n\nOf course, this comfortable, talkative environment paved the way for Colbert\u2019s inevitable question: \u201cDo you have anything right now you\u2019d like to tell us about your plans?\u201d\n\nBefore Colbert could even finish, Biden responded with an emphatic \u201cyes,\u201d which stirred the audience to a loud round of cheers. The vice president quickly pointed at Colbert and joked, \u201cI think you should run for president again and I\u2019ll be your vice president.\u201d However, after some thought, Biden did answer Colbert\u2019s question.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any man or woman should run for president unless, number one, they know exactly why they would want to be president, and two, they can look at the folks out there and say, \u2018I promise you, you have my whole heart, my whole soul, my energy and my passion to do this. I\u2019d be lying if I said that I knew I was there. I\u2019m being completely honest. Nobody has a right, in my view, to seek that office unless they\u2019re willing to give it 110 percent of who they are.\u201d\n\nCheck out part 1 of the interview, via CBS:\n\nCheck out part 2 of the interview, via CBS:\n\n[h/t The New York Times]\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Andrew Husband (@AndrewHusband) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vice President Joe Biden admitted he had his doubts about running for office during his Late Show interview on Thursday.", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/stephen-colbert-joe-biden-interview.jpg", "title": "Joe Biden Chokes Up in Touching Interview with Stephen Colbert"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vice President Joe Biden admitted he had his doubts about running for office during his Late Show interview on Thursday.", "title": "Joe Biden Chokes Up in Touching Interview with Stephen Colbert", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/stephen-colbert-joe-biden-interview.jpg", "creator": "@AndrewHusband", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2015-09-11T10:45:22+00:00", "keywords": "tv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Vice President Joe Biden gave The Late Show\u2018s Stephen Colbert one of his best television interviews to date during Thursday night\u2019s program.\n\u2014 Chris Geidner (@chrisgeidner) September 11, 2015Colbert surely the only late-night host who could conduct this wonderful Biden interview.\nThe vice president quickly pointed at Colbert and joked, \u201cI think you should run for president again and I\u2019ll be your vice president.\u201d However, after some thought, Biden did answer Colbert\u2019s question.\nAlso: This is earnest Colbert, someone we never really have gotten to meet, and Biden is letting us meet him.\n\u201cI know that he was a great man,\u201d Colbert said after offering his condolences to Biden."}
