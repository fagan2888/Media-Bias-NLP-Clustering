But there are a lot of people who worked toward that. \u2026 I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s mine to own, it\u2019s just mine to have right now.\u201d\n\nOver the past three seasons she has done it all in slalom \u2014 three season titles, two world championships gold medals and an Olympic gold medal. She came from behind to win Saturday\u2019s race, her sixth World Cup slalom victory this season and 15th of her career.\n\nShiffrin had a 90-point margin over Sweden\u2019s Frida Hansdotter going into Saturday\u2019s race. Hansdotter could not overtake Shiffrin in the standings unless Hansdotter won and Shiffrin finished out of the top 15.\n\n\u201cThere definitely was a little bit of extra stress,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cHaving a 90-point lead, I was a little more nervous than I might have been if I had less of a lead. At 90 points, you start to feel comfortable, you take your foot off the gas and Frida could easily beat me. If I hadn\u2019t won, she was going to win. I was very happy with the performance with that added pressure.\u201d\n\nGoing into Sunday\u2019s giant slalom that will conclude the World Cup season, Shiffrin is in third place in the GS standings. She can\u2019t win the GS title but wants to finish her GS campaign on a good note.\n\n\u201cI feel like I came up short a little bit in GS (this season), even though it was quite a bit improvement from last year and the year before that,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cOnce again this summer, I\u2019m going to be really thinking hard about what I can do in my GS to get faster.\u201d\n\nShiffrin hopes to start doing some super-G races next season, not only to begin the transition into a four-event skier but also to improve her GS.\n\n\u201cA huge part of it is that I need to learn how to take some risks,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cA lot of these girls who are great GS skiers are also really great speed (downhill and super-G) skiers. In speed, you have to be able to put it down the hill and be comfortable on the edge. And also be sure enough about your technique that you\u2019re still safe. I tend to try to control what\u2019s happening in the GS course a little too much.\u201d\n\nShiffrin returns to the U.S. on Monday and will race the slalom at the U.S. Alpine Championships next Saturday in Sugarloaf, Maine, then spend a week with her grandmother in western Massachusetts.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to be really relaxing,\u201d Shiffrin said. \u201cMy Nana always spoils me when I go visit her, baking cookies and pies. She has the best breakfasts I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019m really excited to see her. I think that might be the only vacation I get, but a week with my Nana is good enough for me.\u201d\n\nResults 15C\n\nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnmeyer", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mikaela Shiffrin secures title No. 3 in slalom", "title": "Mikaela Shiffrin secures title No. 3 in slalom", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/21/mikaela-shiffrin-secures-title-no-3-in-slalom/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150321_020719_mikaela-shiffrin.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150321_020719_mikaela-shiffrin.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-21T14:08:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T19:30:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf1c\"", "article_summary": "She came from behind to win Saturday\u2019s race, her sixth World Cup slalom victory this season and 15th of her career.\nEagleVail\u2019s Mikaela Shiffrin is a teen phenom no more, but she\u2019s still the best slalom skier in the world.\nEight days after her 20th birthday, Shiffrin claimed her third consecutive World Cup slalom title Saturday at the World Cup finals in Meribel, France, then did her best to share her crystal globe with the support system that helped make it possible.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really feel like it\u2019s my globe,\u201d Shiffrin said.\nI was very happy with the performance with that added pressure.\u201dGoing into Sunday\u2019s giant slalom that will conclude the World Cup season, Shiffrin is in third place in the GS standings."}
