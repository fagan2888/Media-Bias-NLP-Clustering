Cruz, Rubio stress strong values\n\nRepublican Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio warned Thursday that the Obama administration\u2019s policies must be reined in, while stressing the importance of strong moral values.\n\nThe remarks, made during the annual Road to Majority conference of Christian conservatives, come as both men appear to be testing the waters for potential presidential runs in 2016.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCruz in particular warned that liberal policies are harmful to religious liberty.\n\n\u201cHere at home, we have an IRS who is asking citizens\u2019 groups: Tell me what books you are reading. Tell me the content of your prayers,\u201d said Cruz, the junior senator from Texas and a favorite of the conservative grassroots. \u201cLet me tell you something: The federal government has no business asking any American that.\u201d\n\n( PHOTOS: 2016: Who\u2019s next?)\n\nCruz also used the occasion to touch on the case of Hobby Lobby, the national retail chain challenging on religious grounds the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that it provide employees with health insurance that covers contraception. The Supreme Court is expected to hand down its ruling in the case before the end of the month.\n\nPacing the star-spangled ballroom stage, Cruz hammered home his opposition to the health law, citing the case of a group of Catholic nuns challenging the contraception requirement.\n\n\u201cLet me give you a simple rule of thumb: If you are litigating against nuns, you probably got something wrong,\u201d Cruz said to roaring applause.\n\n( QUIZ: Do you know Ted Cruz?)\n\nRubio said a major cause of rising poverty was the breakdown of the traditional American family. He also advocated for bureaucratic reform and a break-up of the \u201cexisting higher education cartel\u201d that drives up the cost of a college degree.\n\n\u201cWe must reinvigorate the role of values in our country,\u201d the Florida senator said. \u201cYou can have all the diplomas on the wall you want. If you do not have the values of hard work \u2026 then you will not succeed.\u201d\n\nCruz and Rubio were joined on stage by Utah GOP Sen. Mike Lee, Fox News analyst Monica Crowley, former House member Allen West, and former Ambassador John Bolton, as well as Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, which puts on the conference.\n\n( QUIZ: Do you know Marco Rubio?)\n\nThe three-day gathering, which ends Saturday, will play host to several of the GOP\u2019s potential 2016 contenders, including Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will headline Friday\u2019s events.\n\nFaith and Freedom Coalition organizers expect close to 2,000 people from across the country to attend the conference throughout the weekend. The event is billed as a \u201cpolicy conference and strategy briefing\u201d for the Christian right.\n\nReed called the summit \u201can island of reality in a sea of fantasy\u201d during the kickoff luncheon Thursday.\n\nSoft Christian rock filled the air. Many people came as part of church groups or with their families. At least one man, calling himself a tea party patriot, wore Revolutionary-era garb and carried a flag bearing the words \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me.\u201d\n\nAfter lunch, attendees boarded buses for Capitol Hill where they were to spend the afternoon lobbying against the Affordable Care Act, the Common Core education standards, and immigration reform they allege will lead to \u201camnesty.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Republicans argue that the Barack Obama-led government must be reined in.", "title": "Cruz, Rubio stress strong values", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/ted-cruz-marco-rubio-liberals-religion-108081.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/04/21/130421_cruz_rubio_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,2016 Elections,Religion,Religious Freedom,Marco Rubio,Ted Cruz", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The Republicans argue that the Barack Obama-led government must be reined in.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd413d\"", "article_summary": "Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio warned Thursday that the Obama administration\u2019s policies must be reined in, while stressing the importance of strong moral values.\nCruz, Rubio stress strong valuesRepublican Sens.\nTell me the content of your prayers,\u201d said Cruz, the junior senator from Texas and a favorite of the conservative grassroots.\nThe three-day gathering, which ends Saturday, will play host to several of the GOP\u2019s potential 2016 contenders, including Kentucky Sen.
