Ted Cruz (R) of Texas sit on a table during a campaign stop in Rockwell City, Iowa, on Monday. One GOP Senate critics charges that Cruz's combative positions are leading the GOP into a no-win 'box canyon.'\n\n\u201cBox canyon.\u201d A Wild West metaphor, it describes a political situation from which you can\u2019t easily extricate yourself and are vulnerable to attack.\n\nPoliticians and political observers love Western movies, which probably helps explain this phrase\u2019s increasing popularity. They feature clear-cut good guys and bad guys and thrilling situations that don\u2019t lend themselves to ambiguity.\n\nWriting about the upheaval in the House over who should succeed outgoing Speaker John Boehner, Forbes contributor Ralph Benko suggested that, if Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan decides against a bid, Republicans turn to one of two Lone Star State lawmakers: Jeb Hensarling or Kevin Brady. \u201cWhen you find yourself in a box canyon,\u201d Benko wrote, \u201cyou would be smart to turn to a Texan to guide you out.\u201d\n\nA few weeks before all of this tumult ensued, George Washington University political scientist Sarah Binder, who also is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, analyzed the motivations of the Freedom Caucus, the ultra-conservative House members who were central in majority leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s decision not to run for speaker. Binder wrote that its members\u2019 strategy of holding government funding hostage to defunding the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare) and Planned Parenthood \u201cmakes perfect sense for a House member playing to his or her partisan base rather than to the broader public.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cConservative Republicans could see such past episodes as political successes even if the party brand name took a beating at the time. GOP electoral gains in 2014 surely reinforce such positive perceptions. Heading down into the box canyon \u2013 not getting out \u2013 is the whole point.\u201d\n\nBefore jumping into the 2016 presidential race, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz already had drawn plenty of criticism for his central role in the 2013 government shutdown over the defunding Obamacare. His Senate GOP colleague Bob Corker of Tennessee, in a sharp poke at Cruz\u2019s Ivy League credentials, said before the shutdown: \u201cI didn\u2019t go to Harvard or Princeton, but I can count \u2013 the defunding box canyon is a tactic that will fail and weaken our position.\u201d\n\nA year later, Huffington Post\u2019s Howard Fineman cited the unpopularity of Cruz\u2019s conservative stances with Hispanics and other minority groups to ask whether the candidate had \u201cthe wherewithal to stampede the entire GOP into a demographic box canyon.\u201d\n\nBut it isn\u2019t always Republicans who get tagged with the metaphor. In the Gazette of Colorado Springs, Colo., Richard Berman of the conservative Center for Union Facts contended that the Employee Rights Act \u2013 a bill that would that would make it harder for unions to win organizing campaigns \u2013 \u201chas pushed Democrats into a policy box canyon where they can't run or hide. When they try to shoot their way out of supporting this popular policy, the public will recognize who's wearing the black hats.\u201d\n\nChuck McCutcheon writes his \"Speaking Politics\" blog exclusively for Politics Voices.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "938761cc4e1bf6c30137d331689f7f4f", "sailthru.author": "Chuck McCutcheon", "description": "Maybe 'heading down into the box canyon \u2013 not getting out \u2013 is the whole point.'", "sailthru.image.std": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2015/10/940896_1_1013-TED-CRUZ-sized.jpg_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "author": "The Christian Science Monitor", "og": {"site_name": "The Christian Science Monitor", "description": "Maybe 'heading down into the box canyon \u2013 not getting out \u2013 is the whole point.'", "title": "How 'box canyon' became the go-to metaphor for lost political causes", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Politics-Voices/2015/1013/How-box-canyon-became-the-go-to-metaphor-for-lost-political-causes", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2015/10/940896_1_1013-TED-CRUZ-sized.jpg_standard.jpg?alias=standard_900x600", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@csmonitor", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2015/10/940896_1_1013-TED-CRUZ-sized.jpg_standard.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "description": "Maybe 'heading down into the box canyon \u2013 not getting out \u2013 is the whole point.'", "card": "summary", "title": "How 'box canyon' became the go-to metaphor for lost political causes"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-10-13", "DC.date.issued": "2015-10-13T14:10:03-04:00", "fb": {"page_id": 14660729657, "app_id": 179793002061452}, "sailthru.content.body": "http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/rssfull/USA/Politics/Politics-Voices/2015/1013/How-box-canyon-became-the-go-to-metaphor-for-lost-political-causes", "sailthru.tags": "section-politics-voices,section-politics,section-usa,class-blog-post,storysource-guest-blogger", "article": {"section": "Politics Voices", "published_time": "2015-10-13T14:10-05"}, "copyright": "The Christian Science Monitor", "sailthru.image.credit": "Charlie Neibergall/AP"}, "article_summary": "\u201cBox canyon.\u201d A Wild West metaphor, it describes a political situation from which you can\u2019t easily extricate yourself and are vulnerable to attack.\nMaybe 'heading down into the box canyon \u2013 not getting out \u2013 is the whole point.'\nOne GOP Senate critics charges that Cruz's combative positions are leading the GOP into a no-win 'box canyon.'\nPoliticians and political observers love Western movies, which probably helps explain this phrase\u2019s increasing popularity.\nHeading down into the box canyon \u2013 not getting out \u2013 is the whole point.\u201dBefore jumping into the 2016 presidential race, Texas Sen.
