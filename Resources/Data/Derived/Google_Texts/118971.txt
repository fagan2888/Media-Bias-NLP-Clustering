A Hutchinson man was sentenced to 15 years and two months in prison for killing a carnival worker at the Kansas State Fair.

Michael Brisco Jr. was sentenced Friday for six felonies, including reckless involuntary manslaughter. Bisco pleaded guilty last month in the September 2013 shooting death of 26-year-old Sem Adrien of Chicago.

The Hutchinson News reports Sem went to Brisco's home for a haircut. Prosecutors say a party was going on and Sem made some comments that upset some people in the house. Sem apparently was shot as he tried to flee. No one in the home called police and a passerby found his body in a parking lot near Brisco's home.
