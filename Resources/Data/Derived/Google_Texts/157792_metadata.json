For example, (Alex) Tanguay is all alone in front of the net and he\u2019s trying a little (pass) to Iggy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to refocus. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want Iggy scoring his 600th but we need to play our game,\u201d Roy said\n\nIt didn\u2019t happen in Calgary\u2019s 4-0 triumph, and Iginla remains stuck on 599 after three goalless games. Just a bad night overall for the men in burgundy and blue, who fell to 6-9-3 at home.\n\nWe didn\u2019t match the intensity that they brought,\u201d Iginla said. \u201cEvery part of our game was not up to where it needs to be. It\u2019s costly. It\u2019s at home. We have to build a run at home. There\u2019s no excuses for that. We were off tonight and got outplayed.\u201d\n\nThe Flames \u2014 who entered 5-11-2 on the road \u2014 led 1-0 after the first period and 4-0 after two. Defenseman Dougie Hamilton opened the scoring with a wrist shot, and two deflections off shots from the point put the visitors in command in the second.\n\nIt only got worse. Goalie Semyon Varlamov was pulled after Mikael Backlund scored on his own rebound at 13:07 of the second. Calvin Pickard finished in net for the Avs, who are on a four-game winless skid (0-2-2) in Denver.\n\nIn the third period, the Avs had three shots clang off iron beside goalie Karri Ramo, who had a relatively easy night. Most his saves were in his glove or chest.\n\nColorado\u2019s comeback effort was slowed by four third-period penalties, including a double-minor for high-sticking on Nathan MacKinnon.\n\n\u201cI think penalties killed us. Too many penalties and we only drew two,\u201d Avs forward Matt Duchene said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to play when you\u2019re doing that, tough to get flow. We just didn\u2019t have it tonight, I guess.\u201d\n\nCenter John Mitchell took three penalties for the Avs and was banished to the fourth line in the third period.\n\nThe Avs return to action Monday against the visiting Los Angeles Kings and continue their homestand Wednesday against the St. Louis Blues.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jarome Iginla, Avalanche shut out by Calgary", "title": "Jarome Iginla, Avalanche shut out by Calgary", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/02/jarome-iginla-avalanche-shut-out-by-calgary/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160102__Jarome-Iginlap1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160102__Jarome-Iginlap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-02T22:42:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T23:02:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The pucks didn\u2019t go in for Jarome Iginla and the bounces went against his teammates Saturday night.\nCalvin Pickard finished in net for the Avs, who are on a four-game winless skid (0-2-2) in Denver.\nFor example, (Alex) Tanguay is all alone in front of the net and he\u2019s trying a little (pass) to Iggy.\n\u201cI thought we had good intention (but) I guess we focused more in seeing Iggy scoring that 600th instead of playing our game,\u201d Avalanche coach Patrick Roy said.\nIn the third period, the Avs had three shots clang off iron beside goalie Karri Ramo, who had a relatively easy night."}
