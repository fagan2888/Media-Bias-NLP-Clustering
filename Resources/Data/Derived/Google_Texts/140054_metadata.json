In the end, he decided to take the 18-year-old defenseman from Belle River, Ontario, with the first selection at the Wells Fargo Center.\n\n\u201cThat is the burden of expectation. I chase it,\u201d Ekblad said. \u201cI want that burden of expectation. I want that feel for motivation and I want to succeed under that.\u201d\n\nThe Panthers had a top-three pick in the NHL draft for the fourth time in the past five years. The first three \u2014 defenseman Erik Gudbranson (in 2010), wing Jonathan Huberdeau (2011) and center Aleksander Barkov (2013) \u2014 all played significant roles last season. Florida also won the draft lottery in 2002 and 2003, but traded away those picks.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled to have selected Aaron with the No. 1 pick,\u201d Tallon said. \u201cHe is a strong, smart and physically mature defenseman who skates well and can play at both ends of the ice. Aaron is another building block for our team and we are confident that he will fit well with our young nucleus of talented players that includes Aleksander Barkov, Nick Bjugstad, Jonathan Huberdeau and Erik Gudbranson. We look forward to his continued growth and contributions to our team and the South Florida community.\u201d\n\nEkblad was the OHL\u2019s most outstanding defenseman last season, ranking first among defensemen with 23 goals and tying for fifth with 53 points. He also served as Barrie\u2019s captain.\n\nEkblad said he was NHL ready and should fit in with the Panthers after a recent scouting mission.\n\n\u201cYou look who they have on their back end, right or left shots, all that kind of stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI was watching to see if Florida would get a new coach. The last little while, it\u2019s pretty fun to just follow that after the season.\u201d\n\nFlyers fans packed the arena for the first draft in the city. They gave one of the longest sustained boos in recent memory for NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman\u2019s draft introduction. He was drowned out for most of his 2-minute speech thanking the city for its hospitality.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this supposed to be the city of brotherly love,\u201d he asked.\n\nBettman heard a huge ovation over the \u201cLet\u2019s Go Flyers!\u201d chant when he introduced the hometown team for the 17th pick.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s more like it,\u201d he said.\n\nThere was mild applause when the team selected little-known defenseman Travis Sanheim.\n\nFormer Flyer Rod Brind\u2019Amour received a huge ovation when the Carolina assistant coach made the pick for the Hurricanes.\n\nThe Sabres selected center Sam Reinhart with the second overall pick. He is the son of former NHL player Paul Reinhart, who was selected by the Atlanta Flames in the first round in 1979.\n\nReinhart has the potential to be a top-line center in filling a key need for the rebuilding Sabres, who are coming off one of their worst seasons in franchise history. Buffalo (21-51-10) finished last in the NHL standings, and set a franchise record for losses.\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers selected center Leon Draisaitl with the third overall pick, Calgary took center Sam Bennett with the fourth pick and the New York Islanders picked forward Michael Dal Colle fifth. Vancouver selected forward Jake Virtanen with the sixth pick, Carolina took defenseman Haydn Fleury seventh, Toronto took forward William Nylander eighth, Winnipeg selected forward Nickolaj Ehlers ninth and Anaheim completed the top 10 with forward Nick Ritchie.\n\nThe Coyotes made their first pick since changing their name from Phoenix to Arizona. They selected forward Brendan Perlini with the first pick in \u201cArizona\u201d history.\n\nThere was a big trade in the hours before the draft, when the Anaheim Ducks acquired center Ryan Kesler from the Vancouver Canucks for center Nick Bonino, defenseman Luca Sbisa and the 24th overall pick Friday.\n\nThe 29-year-old Kesler is a standout two-way center who has spent his entire 10-season career in Vancouver, compiling six 20-goal seasons and 392 career points. The two-time U.S. Olympian won the Selke Trophy in 2011 as the NHL\u2019s best defensive forward.\n\nNashville traded forward Patric Hornqvist and Nick Spaling to the Pittsburgh Penguins for forward James Neal midway through the draft.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Aaron Ekblad chosen by Panthers with No. 1 pick in draft", "title": "Aaron Ekblad chosen by Panthers with No. 1 pick in draft", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/27/aaron-ekblad-chosen-by-panthers-with-no-1-pick-in-draft/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140627__ekblad-draftp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140627__ekblad-draftp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-27T17:28:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:42:46+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde389\"", "article_summary": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 With the first pick of the NHL draft, the Florida Panthers went with 15 seconds of dramatic pause before announcing the name.\nI want that feel for motivation and I want to succeed under that.\u201dThe Panthers had a top-three pick in the NHL draft for the fourth time in the past five years.\nThey selected forward Brendan Perlini with the first pick in \u201cArizona\u201d history.\nVancouver selected forward Jake Virtanen with the sixth pick, Carolina took defenseman Haydn Fleury seventh, Toronto took forward William Nylander eighth, Winnipeg selected forward Nickolaj Ehlers ninth and Anaheim completed the top 10 with forward Nick Ritchie.\nThe Edmonton Oilers selected center Leon Draisaitl with the third overall pick, Calgary took center Sam Bennett with the fourth pick and the New York Islanders picked forward Michael Dal Colle fifth."}
