Tons of emails this week and I am still sorting through them. For those of you who have forwarded your campaigns while still in preview mode (IE not yet launched) please ping us again after they have launched so we can get another chance to take a look at them.\n\nFirst up we have Moore in a Bag from Carianne and Mike based in London (East End). The pair have created their own fashion brand and their latest product is a convertible backpack, shopper and shoulder bag \u2013 pretty much three bags in one. I love the design and I am considering getting one for my significant other as I type. This is part of a larger number of products they are creating the UK. The new brand has captured exposure in Vogue, Elle and other pubs \u2013 their designs are generating some traction with the Fashionista set. So this is your opportunity to get a great product at a reasonable price AND help Mike and Carianne open up their very first pop-up shop in London. No worries on this one hitting goal as they have already beaten their target on Kickstarter. All very cool so check it out.\n\nallGreenup is an App that rewards users for caring about the planet. This campaign is from Chile but they want to go global. And why not? Most of us do care about the planet and our environment and, I would like to believe, the majority of us already try and help out. allGreenup has built their platform from the ground up and they now have over 11,000 users (in South America) and they need some capital to expand. You can head over to the App store and download it now. If you like the App support the crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo! They have received tons of recognition already for their approach.\n\nThis is a late entry for Mailbox as I just happened to see the email come in. Xpressivo is a \u201cstate of the art coffee maker for everyone\u201d. And what exactly does that mean? Well I would say they want to disrupt Nespresso. Ok \u2013 I love coffee and, yes I admit, I have a Nespresso machine. Usually I start the day with traditional drip (exceptionally strong though) and then shift to the Nespresso stuff later in the day. The Nespresso comes later because it is so bloody expensive. So if you can undercut those guys at Nestle hiding out in Switzerland \u2013 more power to you. Their espresso machines are being pitched as top of the line at affordable prices. Coffee capsules are interchangeable with Nespresso. Smart move. Adam Lupa in San Francisco launched this campaign on Kickstarter. Watch the pitch video below.\n\nFinally we have Coxswain Beard Care. This project is from Rick Kadets in Austin, Texas. Rick is a former Marine who served from 2001 to 2005. After watching his pitch video I immediately regretted having shaved my beard just earlier this week. While it wasn\u2019t quite Duck Dynasty yet \u2013 I was working on it. Rick has created a line of mens products that are all organic, natural, cruelty free goodness and he needs some additional capital to get things off the ground. It says on his campaign page that WholeFoods is currently reviewing his product \u2013 so if he makes it in there \u2013 that\u2019s pretty cool. And beards are back too. Just look around. I think Rick is ahead of the curve and, if you agree, help him out by supporting his campaign on Kickstarter now.\n\nIn a world of mass production we design luxury handbags that last into the future.\n\nThe Carianne Moore Kickstarter project will run for 33 days. Here you can shop limited edition products and special Kickstarter exclusives. Every single purchase goes towards raising the 5k target for the Carianne Moore Pop Up to launch.\n\nWhy Kickstarter\n\nCarianne Moore is a growing business with the aim of developing further and believes that through Kickstarters crowd-sourcing platform we can raise the funding to do so. Kickstarter helps to build a community of backers, whereby fans can drive a creative project like our Pop Up shop by pledging as little as \u00a31 and up to \u00a3195 to receive rewards including leathergoods and other exclusive accessories to our project .\n\nCarianne Moores design experience\n\nCarianne has over 14 years experience in the fashion industry working for Uk and International fashion brands. She began her studies in London at Central Saint Martin\u2019s school of design before graduating from London College of Fashion with a BA Hons in Fashion Design Technology and Marketing, specializing in Accessories, Leather goods. Carianne has strong experience in design, manufacturing, marketing and running her own business.\n\nWe seek to encourage and multiply positive actions with information and rewards to generate a positive impact on the planet.\n\nAt allGreenup, we seek to change the relationship of people and taking care of the environment, and we do this by encouraging them to recognize and improve their impact on the planet with a entertaining and easy-to-use Mobile App that rewards users..\n\nWe\u2019re making top-of-the-line coffee machines affordable for everybody.. and delivering delicious coffee capsules to your doorstep.\n\nWelcome to A Better Way to Do Coffee.\n\nOur sleek, new, state-of-the-art Xpressivo \u201cX1\u201d machine makes it easy to quickly brew cafe-quality coffee, espresso, lattes, and more anytime of day \u2013 with just the touch of a button. And we\u2019ll offer it at huge discounts to customers who select one of our monthly coffee capsule delivery plans.\n\nMarine is going Organic on Beards and all Health is breaking loose! Coxswain USA: Man Your Face, Man Your Life.\n\nMy name is Rick and I\u2019m a big fan of beards. As I started growing mine out I realized it takes personal care to maintain your MAN mane.\n\nWhen I found that good products are hard to find, with the exception of online, I got to work.\n\nFirst, I evaluated where I would like to be able to buy them. I like Whole Foods because of their high standards of products they sell. This created accountability for what kind of products I\u2019d be selling to my customers. Whole Foods compliance is a tough process that won\u2019t allow any unnatural colors, fragrances, petroleum or mineral oils; all for a very good reason.\n\nI started my company, Coxswain USA.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "adam lupa, carianne and mike, carianne moore, chile, coxswain beard care, environment, fashion, food, indiegogo, kickstarter, mike harding, rick kadets, united kingdom, xpressivo, finance, fintech, crowdfunding, marketplace lending, peer to peer lending", "ca_image": "http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/moore-in-a-bag-150x150.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Crowdfund Insider", "description": "For this weeks edition of #Crowdfunding Mailbox we have four projects. \u00a0Tons of emails this week and I am still sorting through them. \u00a0For those of you who", "title": "Crowdfunding Mailbox: Moore in a Bag, allGreenup, Xpressivo & Coxswain Beard Care -\u00a0Crowdfund Insider", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/moore-in-a-bag.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-07-27T10:47:17+00:00", "url": "http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2014/07/45287-crowdfunding-mailbox-moore-bag-allgreenup-reset-rpg-coxswain-beard-care/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "For this weeks edition of #Crowdfunding Mailbox we have four projects. \u00a0Tons of emails this week and I am still sorting through them. \u00a0For those of you who have forwarded your campaigns while still in preview mode (IE not yet launched) please ping us again after they have launched so we can get another chance to take a look at them.
