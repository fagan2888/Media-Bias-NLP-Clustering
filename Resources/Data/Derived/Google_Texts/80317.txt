Do You Approve Or Disapprove of President Obama's Job Performance? Vote Now in Urgent Poll

Renowned neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson says he's been having "great difficulty" finding doctors who have anything good to say about Obamacare.He told Fox News Channel's Stuart Varney that he's spoken to hundreds of doctors throughout the country about the Affordable Care Act, and not one of them "liked" President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.Asked if doctors are "in favor" of the huge changes in the health insurance system,Carson that if they are "they're hiding from me, because I travel all over the country and talk to a lot of groups — including lots of doctors — and I'm having a great difficulty finding anybody who likes this."It's profoundly affecting what they are doing," Carson said. "People didn't sign up to become government employees. They signed up because they were intellectually gifted and wanted to use those gifts, to bring health to their patients, not to satisfy some bureaucrat."The retired pediatric neurosurgeon, who is considering a White House run as a Republican in 2016, also slammed the rocky rollout of Obamacare's HealthCare.gov website, comparing the disaster to the time he took part in the first ever surgery to separate twins conjoined at the head."It requires real planning," he said. "You have to get experts. You have to realize that you aren't the expert at everything, but that you have to have access to them and you have to know how to coordinate them. Why they weren't able to do this with something that is one sixth of our economy makes you scratch your head."Carson, who retired in May from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, first made a name for himself amongst Republicans in February when he attacked the president's policies during his keynote address at the White House Prayer Breakfast, with Obama sitting just a few feet away.In October, he told the conservative Values Voter Summit in Washington that Obamacare is "the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery."When Varney asked him whether he planned to run for the White House, Dr. Carson hedged around the issue. But earlier this month he told Newsmax's Steve Malzberg that while he never expected to seek public office, "the good Lord had a different plan for me."
