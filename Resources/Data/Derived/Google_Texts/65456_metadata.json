But, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the deal will add hundreds of billions of dollars to the national debt over the next two decades.\n\nAccording to a report released by the group today, the replacement for the Sustainable Growth Rate proposed by House Speaker John Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi would add $400 billion to the national debt by 2035.\n\n\u201cIn other words, proponents of the \u2018second-decade theory\u2019 appear to be looking only at one side of the ledger,\u201d the group said today. \u201cThey are counting the long-term savings while ignoring the long-term costs.\u201d\n\nBoehner and Pelosi have reportedly agreed to a $210 billion deal that would replace the Sustainable Growth Rate and implement a new payment system for Medicare physicians.\n\nOnly approximately $65 billion of Boehner and Pelosi\u2019s $210 billion plan would be paid for during the first 10 years, according to reports, and the remainder\u2014more than $140 billion\u2014would be added to the deficit.\n\n\u201cIn other words, proponents of the \u2018second-decade theory\u2019 appear to be looking only at one side of the ledger. They are counting the long-term savings while ignoring the long-term costs,\u201d said @BudgetHawks.\n\nSupporters of the deal argue long-term savings achieved through proposed reforms like means testing outweigh the short-term costs of replacing the Sustainable Growth Rate in the first decade. However, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget argues the proposal would add to the debt both this decade and next decade.\n\n>>> Commentary: How Doc Fix Deal House GOP Is Backing Would Increase the Deficit\n\n\u201cIt does not appear this plan would come even close to paying for itself over the long-term,\u201d the group said.\n\nThe Sustainable Growth Rate is the formula used to determine payments to Medicare doctors. The formula has long been deemed unworkable by Republicans and Democrats alike, and over the last 14 years, Congress has passed 17 \u201cdoc fixes\u201d to stabilize payments to physicians as the costs of health care have outpaced the economy.\n\nThe latest \u201cdoc fix\u201d expires March 31, and if lawmakers don\u2019t agree to a solution by then, Medicare doctors could take a 21 percent cut in payments.\n\nSome outside groups like Americans for Tax Reform have come out in support of Boehner and Pelosi\u2019s deal.\n\n\u201cConservatives should hate SGR, and view its replacement with large structural Medicare reforms as a win-win of the highest order,\u201d Ryan Ellis, the tax policy director for Americans for Tax Reform, wrote last week.\n\nHowever, others such as Heritage Action for America, the sister organization of The Heritage Foundation, argue the proposal leads to massive deficit spending.\n\n\u201cFor more than a week, the speaker and his allies have been pushing incomplete information to lawmakers and the media,\u201d Dan Holler, spokesman for Heritage Action, told The Daily Signal. \u201cWith CRFB\u2019s analysis, we now confirm the deal is a budget buster of epic proportions. It\u2019s time to bound the Boehner-Pelosi boondoggle and pursue real reforms\u2014reforms that don\u2019t add hundreds of billions to our national debt.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Boehner\u2019s office could not be reached by The Daily Signal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates a SGR deal will add hundreds of billions of dollars to the national debt over the next two decades.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates a SGR deal will add hundreds of billions of dollars to the national debt over the next two decades.", "title": "Replacement for Medicare Payments Would Add $400B to Debt", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150319_SGRReport_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-21T22:19:21+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1974zRi"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates a SGR deal will add hundreds of billions of dollars to the national debt over the next two decades.", "title": "Replacement for Medicare Payments Would Add $400B to Debt", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150319_SGRReport_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "medicare", "published_time": "2015-03-19T16:14:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-21T22:19:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Sustainable Growth Rate, Medicare, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, John Boehner, Nancy Pelosi, Americans for Tax Reform, Heritage Action for America, doc fix"}, "article_summary": "The Sustainable Growth Rate is the formula used to determine payments to Medicare doctors.\nThey are counting the long-term savings while ignoring the long-term costs,\u201d said @BudgetHawks.\nAccording to a report released by the group today, the replacement for the Sustainable Growth Rate proposed by House Speaker John Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi would add $400 billion to the national debt by 2035.\nBut, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the deal will add hundreds of billions of dollars to the national debt over the next two decades.\nHowever, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget argues the proposal would add to the debt both this decade and next decade."}
