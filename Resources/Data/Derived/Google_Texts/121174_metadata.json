As is always the case when disaster hits, the Southern Baptist Convention Disaster Relief is stepping up to help.\n\nA majority of workers started cleaning up branches and broken trees on Tuesday, now that most of the ice is gone. There was a buzz of activity, with all volunteers doing God's work by cleaning up Mother Nature's mess.\n\n\u201cWe do it for the Lord,\u201d said volunteer Jack McAlister.\n\nThey\u2019re helping those like 91-year-old Fern.\n\n\u201cThey were all so nice and no foul language and no acting up or anything,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just got up there and worked.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur preference is to help widows and elderly and people with disabilities, single-parent moms, also wives when their husbands are deployed overseas, but we\u2019ll help anyone,\u201d said Sam Porter, BGCO Disaster Relief Director.\n\nIn the coming weeks, the group expects thousands of requests for help so they will be bringing in extra crews.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping to have 15 on the ground by the end of the week,\u201d said Porter.\n\nBut there is a lot to be done. And it will take a while.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping we can get everyone back in their own home by Christmas,\u201d explained Porter.\n\nIt is a tremendous amount of work, and that's not lost by those on the receiving end.\n\n\u201cShe was such a sweet lady and fixed us cookies afterward,\u201d said McAlister of Fern. \u201cWe were just happy to be able to help.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have to pay for it and I thought the cookies were such a small \u2018thank you,\u2019\u201d said Fern.\n\nAlthough volunteers have to go through a class to run the chain saws, BGCO is looking for volunteers to help clear branches.
