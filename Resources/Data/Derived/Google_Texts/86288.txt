A bicycling duo from England is making its way from Rio de Janeiro, down through South America and now all the way to New York. But they didn't want to miss an opportunity to stop at the Jimmie Rodgers Museum in the Queen City to learn a little bit more about country music history.

"It's exciting for us to have that opportunity and to come to places like meridian where it all began. It's where country music began," Will Fulford-Jones says.

They've already traveled 16,000 miles and have about 1,500 to go.
