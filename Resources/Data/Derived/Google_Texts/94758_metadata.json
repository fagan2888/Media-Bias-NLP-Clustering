The vehicle jumped the curve and swiped our mailbox along with our two neighbor\u2019s mailboxes.\n\nAll too often this would have been the end of the story. But in this case the young man returned a few minutes later with his father. The young man owned up to the fact that he was responsible for the accident. He promised he would take care of the damage, and he was true to his word. Within days the mailboxes were replaced.\n\nI should add that last year the same mailboxes were hit by a city snowplow and the repair was adequate, but the new mailboxes are far superior to the ones they replaced. I would have liked to thank the young man personally, but I never got his name or where he lives.\n\nIt is refreshing to know that there are young people who take responsibility for their actions and in this case went beyond what I would have expected. To whoever you are, thank you.\n\nLeRoy and Mary Matuszak, Green Bay\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1Aujjll", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Young man promised to take care of the damage, and he was true to his word.", "og": {"site_name": "Press Gazette Media", "description": "Young man promised to take care of the damage, and he was true to his word.", "title": "Driver owns to up mailbox damage", "url": "http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/opinion/readers/2014/12/13/driver-owns-mailbox-damage/20332051/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/greenbaypressgazette.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Young man promised to take care of the damage, and he was true to his word.", "title": "Driver owns to up mailbox damage", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dd5345e038bd7b4ac45ddbb1c49dacad57152fdf/c=30-0-182-152&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/GreenBay/2014/12/12/B9315483353Z.1_20141212202214_000_G159D59K5.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@gbpressgazette", "site": "@gbpressgazette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=883246918", "fb": {"app_id": 179406702077699}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb7b9\"", "article_summary": "I would have liked to thank the young man personally, but I never got his name or where he lives.\nThe young man owned up to the fact that he was responsible for the accident.\nBut in this case the young man returned a few minutes later with his father.\nThe vehicle jumped the curve and swiped our mailbox along with our two neighbor\u2019s mailboxes.\nFile (Photo: Submitted)A couple of weeks ago a young man drove a little too fast around a corner by our house and lost control of his vehicle."}
