Jon?\u201d\n\nThose were the last words of the last episode of \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d a delightful, zany half-hour that had to do the hard work of saying goodbye to one of the oddest creations on television. \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d was a fake-news late-night show on a comedy network that leaned hard left by pretending to lean hard right; try explaining that to anyone in 20 years, and see where it gets you. The final words seemed to be a nod to the ephemeral nature of the show\u2014Stephen Colbert, a character played by a comedian named Stephen Colbert, floated away to eternity, guided by Santa Claus, unicorn Abraham Lincoln, and, obviously, Alex Trebek (the man with all the answers; every answer is a question).\n\nAnd with his last word he tossed the ball back to Jon Stewart, the guy who ran the show that Colbert spawned from, the guy who will be holding down the fort after the real Colbert moves on to CBS. And after Jon Stewart himself said goodnight to the audience, the episode cut to an exchange between the two from June 3, 2010\u2014probably an outtake\u2014with a rare occurrence indeed. Stephen Colbert broke character. Stewart asks: \u201cHey Stephen, what are you doing?\u201d Colbert responds: \u201cI\u2019m getting angry at liberals,\u201d a grin cracking his face.\n\nIt felt like a perfectly fitting coda. Whoever or whatever \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d will be hosted by, it will not be \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d\u2019s Stephen Colbert, the one who presented to Congress and spoke at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner in flawless, pitch-perfect character. Unless CBS and mainstream American audiences are in for the craziest long-con prank in history, Stephen Colbert will no longer be America\u2019s most conservative superhero, but a guy who talks to celebrities about upcoming movies and does a minutes-long stand-up introduction to the show. Colbert being okay, he\u2019ll find a way to make it interesting\u2014and, in all likelihood, sneakily liberal\u2014but look, it\u2019s not going to be this. It\u2019s not going to be Stephen Colbert acting out lightning striking him and making him immortal; it\u2019s not going to be dozens if not hundreds of former guests on the show gathering into a small Comedy Central studio to sing \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d\u2014which, incidentally, also plays over the end of \u201cDr. Strangelove.\u201d Vox made a list of the guests that returned: There were a lot, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bryan Cranston, Patrick Stewart, Bill Clinton (!), Arianna Huffington, Katie Couric, Cyndi Lauper, Jeff Daniels, Sam Waterston, and oh, yeah, Cookie Monster. Finales of beloved shows are typically terrible; \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d found a way to go out in an over-the-top style that felt true to the show\u2019s batty humor.\n\nBecause that\u2019s the thing: \u201cColbert Report\u201d wasn\u2019t always a bona fide hit; it wasn\u2019t always something people got. The intensely performative character Colbert was playing didn\u2019t sit right with everyone; the joke required so much work by the audience that studies discovered that conservatives thought Colbert was being perfectly sincere. There are a lot of late-night hosts in the world, and a lot of them assume a personality that\u2019s made just for the camera. Colbert took that so far\u2014and made it so political\u2014that he\u2019s been intense character for a literal decade, bringing that persona to the real world over and over again, revealing politics as performance, news as splashy fiction, and history as farce, and he did it while making us laugh, too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On the \"Report\"s last night on the air, the legendary host gave a hilarious, moving coda to his career as \"Colbert\"", "title": "Colbert\u2019s pitch-perfect finale: \u201cStephen Colbert\u201d breaks character at last", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "On the \"Report\"s last night on the air, the legendary host gave a hilarious, moving coda to his career as \"Colbert\"", "title": "Colbert\u2019s pitch-perfect finale: \u201cStephen Colbert\u201d breaks character at last", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/19/colberts_pitch_perfect_finale_stephen_colbert_breaks_character_at_last/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/colbert_finale2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On the \"Report\"s last night on the air, the legendary host gave a hilarious, moving coda to his career as \"Colbert\"", "title": "Colbert\u2019s pitch-perfect finale: \u201cStephen Colbert\u201d breaks character at last", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/colbert_finale2.jpg", "creator": "@soniasaraiya", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sonia Saraiya", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, comedy central, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, The Colbert Report, The Late Show", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0709\"", "article_summary": "Topics: comedy central, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, The Colbert Report, The Late Show, Entertainment News\u201cFrom eternity, I\u2019m Stephen Colbert.\nWhoever or whatever \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d will be hosted by, it will not be \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d\u2019s Stephen Colbert, the one who presented to Congress and spoke at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner in flawless, pitch-perfect character.\nStephen Colbert broke character.\nBecause that\u2019s the thing: \u201cColbert Report\u201d wasn\u2019t always a bona fide hit; it wasn\u2019t always something people got.\nThe intensely performative character Colbert was playing didn\u2019t sit right with everyone; the joke required so much work by the audience that studies discovered that conservatives thought Colbert was being perfectly sincere."}
