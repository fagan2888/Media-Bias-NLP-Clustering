Winston, who has the look of a franchise-caliber player on the field, has displayed nothing but bust potential off it. And while Mariota has few, if any, character flaws, his development since high school has been in a scheme that doesn\u2019t require him to do many of the things that are absolutely essential in the NFL game.\n\nFor instance, the version of the spread offense Oregon runs doesn\u2019t require Mariota to make a lot of the throws that are fundamental elements in the NFL route tree. Because they\u2019re not a part of their scheme, Oregon players seldom, if ever, even practice routes such as the skinny post, which forces a quarterback to throw between two closing defenders in the middle of the field; the dig, another midfield throw against a hard-charging defender; or the back-shoulder fade, which is supposed to be a big part of the Bucs\u2019 offense.\n\nAs a result, some scouts believe Mariota might need at least a year, maybe two, of development before he can become truly successful in the NFL. The Bucs might not wish to wait that long.\n\nBesides, Bucs coach Lovie Smith said just last week that the play of quarterbacks Josh McCown and Mike Glennon, though far from exceptional, is the least of his concerns right now. He\u2019s far more concerned with a sub-standard pass rush on pace to record just 25 sacks, a group of pass protectors that are on pace to give up 44 sacks and a coverage unit that has just six interceptions.\n\nIf little changes between now and the end of the season \u2014 and there is little reason to believe that anything will \u2014 those are the areas the Bucs might look to address first come draft day. So instead of looking solely at quarterbacks, Bucs fans eager to move into draft mode might want to start looking at some of the upcoming draft\u2019s top-rated edge rushers, left tackles and cornerbacks.\n\nThey also might want to look at the top-rated middle linebackers, safeties and guards. The Bucs are a team with a lot of holes to fill, and with a little maneuvering they could fill several in one draft.\n\nNebraska defensive end Randy Gregory, Texas A&M left tackle Cedric Ogbuehi and Miami middle linebacker Denzel Perryman are players whose names Bucs fans might want to learn.\n\nIf the Bucs have a top-five pick and still deem quarterback a secondary need, they could easily turn that top-five selection into a pair of first-round picks that allow them to fill two primary needs.\n\nSo, while Winston and Mariota look like the dream picks now, a greater need \u2014 both in the short term and the long term \u2014 could force the Bucs to spend their first pick (or picks) on other positions.\n\nEvery team wants and most need a franchise quarterback. But the Bucs, as they\u2019re situated, need a lot more than that if they\u2019re going to spend the second half of the 2015 season preparing for the playoffs.\n\nrcummings@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7979\n\nTwitter: @RCummingsTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 15 Nov 2014 15:39:29 -0400", "Description": "LANDOVER, Md. \u2014 For the fourth time in the past six years, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will spend the second half of their season preparing more for next year\u2019s draft than this year\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "LANDOVER, Md. \u2014 For the fourth time in the past six years, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will spend the second half of their season preparing more for next year\u2019s draft than this year\u2019", "title": "Bucs Beat: Draft needs could be far greater than a QB", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/sports/bucs/bucs-beat-draft-needs-could-be-far-greater-than-a-qb-20141115/", "image": {"width": 3000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141115/ARTICLE/141119425/AR/0/AR-141119425.jpg", "height": 2177}, "updated_time": "2014-11-15T15:39:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "LANDOVER, Md. \u2014 For the fourth time in the past six years, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will spend the second half of their season preparing more for next year\u2019s draft than this year", "title": "Bucs Beat: Draft needs could be far greater than a QB", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141115/ARTICLE/141119425/AR/0/AR-141119425.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-11-15T15:39:29Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-11-15T15:39:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d41\"", "article_summary": "But the Bucs, as they\u2019re situated, need a lot more than that if they\u2019re going to spend the second half of the 2015 season preparing for the playoffs.\nThe Bucs are a team with a lot of holes to fill, and with a little maneuvering they could fill several in one draft.\nWinston, who has the look of a franchise-caliber player on the field, has displayed nothing but bust potential off it.\nSo, while Winston and Mariota look like the dream picks now, a greater need \u2014 both in the short term and the long term \u2014 could force the Bucs to spend their first pick (or picks) on other positions.\nAs a result, some scouts believe Mariota might need at least a year, maybe two, of development before he can become truly successful in the NFL."}
