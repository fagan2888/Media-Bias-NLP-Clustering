The company will also offer telephone support and online assistance.\n\n\u201cWe entered into this partnership to empower retirees with information to help them select a healthcare plan that is best for them and their family,\u201d Wayne County Executive Warren Evans said in a statement. \u201cWe have worked diligently to put the support mechanisms in place to ensure retirees transition smoothly throughout this process. I encourage all eligible retirees to take advantage of these resources.\u201d\n\nWayne County, which has more than 5,000 retirees, has changed its health insurance as part of cost-cutting measures aimed at addressing the county\u2019s $52 million structural deficit. County retirees\u2019 current health care plan ends Nov. 30 and the new plan takes effect Dec. 1.\n\nUnder the new plan, eligible retirees will be given a monthly stipend to purchase health insurance. Eligible retirees are those who were in a bargaining unit and retired with insurance benefits under the 1990 Wayne County Health and Welfare Benefit Plan as well as those who retired under an executive and non-executive exempt benefit plan.\n\nThe amount of the stipend depends on each retiree\u2019s eligibility for Medicare. Those who are eligible for Medicare will receive a $130 stipend for themselves and $130 for a spouse to buy supplemental health insurance. Retirees who do not qualify for Medicare will also receive an income-based stipend to buy insurance on the national exchange under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCounty and AmWINS representatives will lead the meetings and answer questions.\n\nWayne County retiree health insurance meetings\n\nThe county has organized several seminars to provide retirees information about changes to their health care.\n\nFor Medicare eligible retirees and spouses:\n\n\u25a010 a.m. and 2 p.m. Tuesday \u2014 Ray Mix Room, Wayne County Community College District\u2019s Downriver Campus, 21000 Northline, Taylor.\n\n\u25a010 a.m., 2 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. Wednesday \u2014 Ted Scott Room, Wayne County Community College District\u2019s Western Campus, 9555 Haggerty, Belleville.\n\n\u25a010 a.m. and 2 p.m. Thursday \u2014 Lorenzo Cultural Center, Macomb Community College\u2019s Center Campus, 44575 Garfield, Clinton Township.\n\n\u25a02 p.m. Oct. 14 \u2014 Room 240, Building G, Oakland Community College, 2900 Featherstone, Auburn Hills.\n\n\u25a02 p.m. Oct. 15 \u2014 Lorenzo Cultural Center, Macomb Community College\u2019s Center Campus, 44575 Garfield, Clinton Township.\n\nFor Pre-Medicare eligible retirees and spouses\n\n\u25a010 a.m. Oct. 14 \u2014 Room 240, Building G, Oakland Community College, 2900 Featherstone, Auburn Hills.\n\n\u25a010 a.m. Oct. 15 \u2014 Lorenzo Cultural Center, Macomb Community College\u2019s Center Campus, 44575 Garfield, Clinton Township.\n\nFor both Pre-Medicare and Medicare eligible retirees and spouses\n\n\u25a06 p.m. Oct. 13 \u2014 Wayne County Community College District\u2019s Eastern Campus, 5901 Conner, Detroit.\n\n\u25a01 p.m. Oct. 13 \u2014 AFSCME Sub Chapter 38 meeting, UAW Local #182, 35603 Plymouth Road, Livonia.\n\nAnyone who cannot attend one of the meetings should call AmWINS Customer Care Center at (877) 847-9906 to learn about 2015-16 retiree medical and prescription drug plan options.\n\nSource: Wayne County\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1Lel0M2", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Current insurance plan ends Nov. 30, new plan with monthly stipend goes into effect Dec. 1.", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "Current insurance plan ends Nov. 30, new plan with monthly stipend goes into effect Dec. 1.", "title": "Wayne Co. offers retirees new health care information", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/wayne-county/2015/10/05/wayne-county-retirees-new-health-care-info/73395928/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Current insurance plan ends Nov. 30, new plan with monthly stipend goes into effect Dec. 1.", "title": "Wayne Co. offers retirees new health care information", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2cd7782733c0c584a11eb37999b5e48b7b855e87/c=591-0-3063-2472&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/05/DetroitNews/B99311514Z.1_20151005150855_000_G77JR0C1.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Wayne County, retirees, health care, information"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc3b3\"", "article_summary": "Wayne County retiree health insurance meetingsThe county has organized several seminars to provide retirees information about changes to their health care.\nCounty retirees\u2019 current health care plan ends Nov. 30 and the new plan takes effect Dec. 1.\n\u25a010 a.m., 2 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. Wednesday \u2014 Ted Scott Room, Wayne County Community College District\u2019s Western Campus, 9555 Haggerty, Belleville.\nUnder the new plan, eligible retirees will be given a monthly stipend to purchase health insurance.\nFor both Pre-Medicare and Medicare eligible retirees and spouses\u25a06 p.m. Oct. 13 \u2014 Wayne County Community College District\u2019s Eastern Campus, 5901 Conner, Detroit."}
