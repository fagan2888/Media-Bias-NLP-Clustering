Ryan said on Twitter in advance of the House\u2019s reconvening for the second session of the 114th Congress.\n\nTo reach their long-sought goal, House Republicans are planning to approve a Senate measure repealing the health care bill and stripping federal money for Planned Parenthood. It was passed under special budget rules that prevented Senate Democrats from using a filibuster to block, as they have in the past. But Republicans seizing the majority in the Senate will allow them to finally push the measure through to Mr. Obama.\n\nThe victory, while symbolic, will be short-lived. Mr. Obama will certainly veto a measure that repeals his signature domestic policy achievement. House Republicans will try to override the veto but cannot reach the necessary threshold without Democratic support.\n\nBut Republicans view forcing the president to reject the measure as meeting their promise to do whatever they can to overturn the legislation. They also hope it eases some conservative unrest over the recently approved budget deal struck with Democrats.\n\nThe Senate will not be back until next week, just in time for Mr. Obama\u2019s final State of the Union address.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20160104064023, "BN": "first-draft", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "per": "Obama, Barack", "article": {"published_time": 1451907623, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/carl_hulse/index.html", "section": "Politics", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2016-01-04T11:40:24-05:00"}, "keywords": "Obama Barack,Law and Legislation,United States Politics and Government,House of Representatives,Senate,Uncategorized", "description": "The House will open 2016 doing something Republicans have been itching to do for years: send a repeal of the Affordable Care Act to President Obama\u2019s desk, even if it is unlikely they can override his veto.", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Carl Hulse", "SCG": "First Draft", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Carl Hulse", "byl": "Carl Hulse", "twitter": {"description": "The House will open 2016 doing something Republicans have been itching to do for years: send a repeal of the Affordable Care Act to President Obama\u2019s desk, even if it is unlikely they can override his veto.", "title": "House Returns From Break With Plan to Send Health Care Repeal to Obama's Desk", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/04/house-returns-from-break-with-plan-to-send-health-care-repeal-to-obamas-desk/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/01/03/us/03firstdraftnl-ryan/03firstdraftnl-ryan-thumbLarge.jpg", "creator": "@hillhulse", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/post", "news_keywords": "Senate", "CG": "Politics", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "January 4, 2016", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-01042016.jsonp", "org": "House of Representatives;Senate", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160104114024, "PUD": 20160104, "pdate": 20160104, "des": "Law and Legislation;United States Politics and Government", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/01/03/us/03firstdraftnl-ryan/03firstdraftnl-ryan-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "First Draft", "description": "The House will open 2016 doing something Republicans have been itching to do for years: send a repeal of the Affordable Care Act to President Obama\u2019s desk, even if it is unlikely they can override his veto.", "title": "House Returns From Break With Plan to Send Health Care Repeal to Obama's Desk", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/04/house-returns-from-break-with-plan-to-send-health-care-repeal-to-obamas-desk/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/01/03/us/03firstdraftnl-ryan/03firstdraftnl-ryan-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "House Returns From Break With Plan to Send Health Care Repeal to Obama's Desk", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2016/01/03/us/03firstdraftnl-ryan/03firstdraftnl-ryan-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "January 4, 2016"}, "article_summary": "To reach their long-sought goal, House Republicans are planning to approve a Senate measure repealing the health care bill and stripping federal money for Planned Parenthood.\nPhotoThe House returns this week from its holiday break, and it will open 2016 doing something Republicans have been itching to do for years: send a repeal of the Affordable Care Act to President Obama\u2019s desk.\nHouse Republicans will try to override the veto but cannot reach the necessary threshold without Democratic support.\nThe Senate will not be back until next week, just in time for Mr. Obama\u2019s final State of the Union address.\nBut Republicans seizing the majority in the Senate will allow them to finally push the measure through to Mr. Obama."}
