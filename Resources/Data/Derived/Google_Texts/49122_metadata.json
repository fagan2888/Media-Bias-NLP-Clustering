He needed help, he said, finding himself.\n\n\"You don\u2019t come onto campus just to get a job, you come on to campus to find yourself, so what are the resources that are going to help you do that,\" Vargas said at a conference held by the Center for Higher Education Retention Excellence at Central Connecticut State University.\n\nVargas and several college students told the audience of educators that the key their success is connecting with a professor or administrator on a personal level.\n\nVargas recently graduated from CCSU, where he got his bachelor\u2019s degree in music. He says what helped him was the college\u2019s Healthy Fellows/Man Enough Support Initiative, a campaign to provide health and wellness services for college men.\n\n\"We have a clinical counselor and the director of admissions here on campus and they spend their time outside of their job description to connect with us,\" Vargas said. \"That is so important.\"\n\nCarol Ortega is a nursing major at the University of St. Joseph. As the first in her family to go to college, she said it\u2019s important that counselors and professors show their human side to students.\n\n\"You guys can\u2019t ask us to put our walls down if you guys aren\u2019t either,\" Ortega said. \"That's really powerful for me.\"\n\nSocial and emotional well-being has become an issue of growing concern. It\u2019s led to programs such as the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence, as well as proposed federal legislation that would provide money to train teachers on how to incorporate social and emotional learning into classroom lessons.\n\n\u201cUntil recently, nobody really knew that emotional intelligence was a hard skill,\u201d said Yale's Mark Brackett in an interview with WNPR earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThis work should be integrated into teacher preparation, but also every school in our opinion should be responsible for adopting an evidence-based approach to social and emotional learning,\u201d Brackett said.\n\nBoth Vargas and Ortega say that having social and emotional support outside of the classroom has been key to their success as students.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Education", "description": "Eric Vargas didn\u2019t need help with his academics.
