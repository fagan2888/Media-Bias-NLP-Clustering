Energy companies accounted for 18% of all bonds sold this year with the lowest possible triple-C credit rating, according to Dealogic.\n\nMany investors are concerned that a prolonged slump in oil prices, which had fallen 37% year-to-date through Friday, will translate into falling revenues. That would make it more difficult for some companies to make interest and principal payments on their debt.\n\nOil prices have bounced back on Monday, but many analysts say there\u2019s little on the horizon to curtail global supplies, which outstrip demand due to rising production in the U.S. and parts of the Middle East. The last leg of oil\u2019s selloff came late last week after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to maintain its target oil-production level.\n\nThe most actively traded junk bonds midday Monday were Linn Energy\u2019s two single-B-rated notes due 2019, which fell 9% to 82 cents on the dollar, pushing yields up to about 11.5%, according to data provider MarketAxess. Trading volume was about $90 million.\n\nHalcon Resources\u2019s 2021 bond, which started weakening Friday, dropped 10% on Monday to 69 cents on the dollar, according to MarketAxess. That selloff pushed up the bond\u2019s yield to 17%. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.\n\nIn June, the Houston company, rated triple-C, raised $150 million by selling shares in gas fields it owns in Mississippi and Louisiana to distressed debt specialist Apollo Global Management.\n\nShares of these oil producers have also taken a hit in recent days amid plunging crude prices. Many hedge-fund managers had parked money in energy-company shares for the short term, and were quick to pull money out as the fall in oil prices accelerated.\n\nShares of Energy XXI recently were down 17% to $3.29, marking a 48% decline in the past two trading days. The offshore oil driller\u2019s debt, which matures in 2017, recently was trading 85 cents on the dollar to yield 15.5%. That\u2019s down from 90 cents on the dollar on Nov. 26.\n\nSome analysts are recommending that investors begin looking for bargains. \u201cWe believe the opportunity is now growing to benefit from the near-term distress of energy producers and potentially add to positions as the price stress plays out,\u201d Steven Wieting, global chief investment strategist with Citigroup Private Bank, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nQuicksilver Resources\u2019s $350 million bond, which pays interest of 7.125% and is due 2016, rebounded slightly this morning but still trades around 22 cents on the dollar. The company has hired Houlihan Lokey Inc. to explore strategic alternatives and bondholders are preparing to take a haircut, a person involved in the matter said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Prices of bonds issued by low-rated energy companies tumbled on Monday, despite a rebound in oil prices, amid worries that this year\u2019s slump in oil markets will lead to a cash crunch.", "title": "Bond Prices of Junk-Rated Energy Companies Tumble", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/12/01/bond-prices-of-junk-rated-energy-companies-tumble/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FU529_oilgas_P_20141201125227.jpg"}, "site": "WSJMoneyBeat", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Bond Prices of Junk-Rated Energy Companies Tumble", "description": "Prices of bonds issued by low-rated energy companies tumbled on Monday, despite a rebound in oil prices, amid worries that this year\u2019s slump in oil markets will lead to a cash crunch.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Matt Wirz", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "MoneyBeat Blog", "page.subsection": "MoneyBeat", "article.summary": "Prices of bonds issued by low-rated energy companies tumbled on Monday, despite a rebound in oil prices, amid worries that this year\u2019s slump in oil markets will lead to a cash crunch.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-12-01T19:18:39-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-158", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/12/01/bond-prices-of-junk-rated-energy-companies-tumble/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-MBB-30348", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Prices of bonds issued by low-rated energy companies tumbled on Monday, despite a rebound in oil prices, amid worries that this year\u2019s slump in oil markets will lead to a cash crunch.", "title": "Bond Prices of Junk-Rated Energy Companies Tumble", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/12/01/bond-prices-of-junk-rated-energy-companies-tumble/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-FU529_oilgas_P_20141201125227.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "MoneyBeat", "article.id": "BL-MBB-30348", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-12-01T19:19:20-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1022\"", "article_summary": "Many investors are concerned that a prolonged slump in oil prices, which had fallen 37% year-to-date through Friday, will translate into falling revenues.\nMany hedge-fund managers had parked money in energy-company shares for the short term, and were quick to pull money out as the fall in oil prices accelerated.\nShares of these oil producers have also taken a hit in recent days amid plunging crude prices.\nGetty ImagesPrices of bonds issued by low-rated energy companies tumbled on Monday, despite a rebound in oil prices, amid worries that this year\u2019s slump in oil markets will lead to a cash crunch.\nEnergy companies accounted for 18% of all bonds sold this year with the lowest possible triple-C credit rating, according to Dealogic."}
