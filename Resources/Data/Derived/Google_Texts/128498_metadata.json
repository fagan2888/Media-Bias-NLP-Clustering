Doug Ducey signed Friday.\n\nThe measure was designed to prevent Arizona from creating its own health care marketplace. But it could affect Arizona residents signed up for Obama\u2019s health care law through the federal marketplace.\n\nIn June, the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to make a decision in the King v. Burwell case for the future of the federal health plan subsidies paid to residents of states that do not operate their own insurance marketplace. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the plaintiffs, the decision could mean the end of subsidies in the 36 states that have not set up exchanges \u2014 including Arizona.\n\nWithout a state marketplace, at least 150,000 Arizona residents currently receiving federal subsidies won\u2019t be able to afford health insurance, said Dr. Dan Derksen, director for the Center for Rural Health at University of Arizona\u2019s College of Public Health. \u201cI think only time is going to tell whether this creates another set of obstacles that individuals who are trying to purchase affordable health care are going to have to jump through,\u201d Derksen said.\n\nDucey said Monday that he would not assume how the Supreme Court decision will affect the state, but he said the Legislature still retains the ability to create a state marketplace if needed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in favor of a state exchange. I\u2019ve been outspoken on this issue and what my opinion is of Obamacare and that I\u2019m not fan of it,\u201d Ducey said. \u201cBut let\u2019s see how the court rules, and then we will have a plan of action.\u201d\n\nHouse Bill 2643 by Rep. Justin Olson, R-Mesa, prevents state and local governments from using financial resources to enforce and implement the Affordable Care Act. Olson said his measure is designed to prevent future legislation.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that state dollars are not used to enforce the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter a number of state departments raised concerns that the original bill would force them to give up federal funding, Olson amended the bill to exempt public health programs authorized by the Affordable Care Act. He also allowed state and local governments to use resources to provide employee health insurance benefits.\n\nOlson said during the Legislative session that his proposal embodies the spirit of voter-approved Proposition 122, which allows the state to opt out of federal laws deemed unconstitutional by the voters or the Legislature.\n\nThe measure was signed Friday, but the governor\u2019s office didn\u2019t include it on an enactment list until Monday evening.\n\n\u201cThe state can still act, the state still has the option to act, we need to see what the Supreme Court says and I\u2019m not going to speculate on that,\u201d Ducey said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"url": "http://www.mohavedailynews.com/news/ducey-signs-ban-on-obamacare-aid/article_b48084f6-e335-11e4-93a9-7fb54e3282a5.html", "type": "article", "site_name": "Mohave Daily News", "description": "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 With the future of subsidies for people who buy health insurance on the federal health marketplace at risk, Arizona will block state and local governments from funding, enforcing or cooperating with the President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law under a bill Gov.
