Neither Butterman nor Nancy Smith, founder and director of Frequent Flyers, wished to turn to the original Martha Graham choreography.\n\nSmith said the Saturday performance will be a fresh take. The orchestra will be onstage, behind the Boulder Ballet dancers, rather than in the pit. The aerial dancers will be above ground for the entire 20-minute work.\n\n\"It's a simple concept: (The aerial dancers) are basically supernatural beings or gods, and the ballet dancers on the ground are humans,\" said Smith, who devised the choreography with the Boulder Ballet's Alex Davison.\n\nThe aerial dancers will be working with their typical apparatuses, fabric, hammocks and hoops.\n\nThe company is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year and is one of the pioneers of the art form. Smith said that while the Frequent Flyers have collaborated with other orchestras and classical groups, this will be the first-ever pairing with their \"home\" professional orchestra, something she and Butterman said was a long time coming.\n\nBoulder Ballet dancers will represent humans on the ground during the Boulder Philharmonic's presentation of \"Appalachian Spring\" by Aaron Copland. (Courtesy photo)\n\n\"A lot will be going on,\" Smith said, \"but we hope that it will wash over the audience and that it will be a complete visual and sensory integration with this great music as the backdrop.\"\n\nButterman leads into this visual extravaganza with a rich slate of music, including the suite from Copland's opera \"The Tender Land.\" The last movement of the suite is an orchestral version of the familiar chorus titled \"The Promise of Living.\"\n\nHere, Butterman saw an opportunity to expand the collaboration by including singers. The choirs of the University of Colorado will join the Phil for the first time.\n\n\"Since Greg Gentry was named director of Choral Studies at CU, we have wanted to do something with them,\" Butterman said, \"and the Copland connection provided a great entry.\"\n\nIn addition to the final movement of the Copland suite, the choirs will join the Phil in Bernstein's \"Chichester Psalms\" from 1965, a popular work with college and professional choirs.\n\nGentry said the Bernstein work, which is sung in Hebrew, is a great fit for his singers. The director, who previously worked with the Phoenix Symphony Chorus, prepared Bloch's \"Sacred Service,\" another piece with a Hebrew text, for a performance with the Colorado Music Festival last summer. He had a professional relationship with outgoing CMF director Michael Christie when the latter was director of the Phoenix Symphony.\n\nThe University Singers, made up of primarily graduate students, and the larger undergraduate University Choir will participate, a total of about 80 singers.\n\n\"I very much believe in choral and orchestral collaborations as being one of the highest orders of our musical art forms,\" Gentry said. \"For the joy of music making in the Boulder community, this is a wonderful offering.\"\n\nWhile the \"Chichester Psalms\" are considered a sacred work, Butterman pointed out that some sections come from discarded portions of \"West Side Story.\" It includes a major part for boy soprano, which will be sung by Quinn Evans of the Boulder Children's Chorale. A student at Manhattan Middle School, Evans, who was born on Sept. 11, 2001, recently gave a performance of \"Pie Jesu\" from the Faure Requiem in memory of those who died the day of his birth.\n\nThe concert opener, fitting the American and nature themes, is \"Rusty Air in Carolina\" by Mason Bates. The short 2006 work blends live music with electronic sounds.\n\n\"That's kind of his calling card,\" Butterman said of Bates. The electronic portion is triggered by laptop and closely integrated with the orchestra.\n\n\"It's complicated and requires a skilled operator,\" Butterman said. \"It's a far cry from the pre-taped stuff of the past.\"\n\nBut it is accessible music, Butterman added, saying, \"It expresses the heat and sultriness of a midsummer mid-Atlantic evening, with strains of folk music and bluegrass.\"\n\nAppropriately, it was originally commissioned by the Winston-Salem Symphony of North Carolina.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_24387988/boulder-philharmonic-collaboration-frequent-flyers-aerial-dance-ballet-cu-choirs", "sailthru.author": "By Kelly Dean Hansen  Camera Classical Music Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:24387988:view"}, "startDate": "2013-10-26T01:00:00-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Director Michael Butterman is excited about his group's upcoming performance with the CU choirs, Boulder Ballet and Frequent Flyers aerial dancers.", "title": "Boulder Philharmonic has sky-high hopes for collaboration", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_24387988/boulder-philharmonic-collaboration-frequent-flyers-aerial-dance-ballet-cu-choirs", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/1025/20131025_013857_27DCPCLA-1w.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/1025/20131025_013857_27DCPCLA-1w_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2013-10-25T13:44:23-0600", "endDate": "2023-10-25T13:01:06-0600", "description": "Director Michael Butterman is excited about his group's upcoming performance with the CU choirs, Boulder Ballet and Frequent Flyers aerial dancers.", "byline": "By Kelly Dean", "pubDate": "2013-10-25T13:44:57-0600", "sailthru.date": "2013-10-26T01:00:00-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder Philharmonic has sky-high hopes for collaboration", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Entertainment", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Entertainment news, Boulder Colorado Entertainment news, Boulder Colorado news, Entertainment Boulder news, Entertainment Colorado news, US Entertainment news, world Entertainment news.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/entertainment/ci_24387988/boulder-philharmonic-collaboration-frequent-flyers-aerial-dance-ballet-cu-choirs", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Director Michael Butterman is excited about his group's upcoming performance with the CU choirs, Boulder Ballet and Frequent Flyers aerial dancers.", "title": "Boulder Philharmonic has sky-high hopes for collaboration"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/1025/20131025_013857_27DCPCLA-1w.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcef5c\"", "article_summary": "Boulder Ballet dancers will represent humans on the ground during the Boulder Philharmonic's presentation of \"Appalachian Spring\" by Aaron Copland.\nThe orchestra will be onstage, behind the Boulder Ballet dancers, rather than in the pit.\nThe concept grew to include not only the Boulder Ballet but also the Boulder-based Frequent Flyers Aerial Dance company.\nThe Frequent Flyers' aerial dancers will be in the air for the Boulder Philharmonic's entire performance of Aaron Copland's \"Appalachian Spring.\"\nBut it is accessible music, Butterman added, saying, \"It expresses the heat and sultriness of a midsummer mid-Atlantic evening, with strains of folk music and bluegrass.\""}
