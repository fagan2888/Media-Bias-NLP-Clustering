What travel destination would you recommend for Baby Boomers that they might not know about?

MOLLY METTLER: Bhutan. It’s a tiny (half the size of Indiana), Buddhist democracy nestled between India and Tibet. It’s beautiful and as un-Western as it can be. Check out this amazing photo of Tiger’s Nest, a Bhutanese monastery that clings to a side of cliff.

Fun facts: The wellbeing of the country is measured not by its GDP but by its GNH: Gross National Happiness. It’s a biodiverse wonderland that is home to the rare Himalayan bear, the very rare golden langur and the exceedingly rare black-necked crane. National law specifies that 60 percent of the country maintain its forest cover. There are no stoplights in its capital, Thimpu. There is no internal air or rail service. If you want to see the country you pay a licensed tour operator a minimum $200 -$250 per person per day. The daily fee provides a guide, a driver, a vehicle, your lodging and meals.
