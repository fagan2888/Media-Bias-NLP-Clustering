Ivangorod, Russia

If Russia ever gets into a direct conflict with the U.S., remember this town's name. It sits across the Narva River from Estonia, a member of NATO. On the other hand, if Russia one day emerges from its dark past and Putinist present to join the rest of Europe, Ivangorod will be a gateway to the West.

Neither outcome...
