( Steve Buttry / Digital First Media )\n\nA series of war injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan disabled Sgt. Greg Butacan forcing him to leave the Army and settle in Sterling.\n\nThree weeks after moving here, flooding Sunday forced Butacan and his wife, Krystal, to leave their home and take emergency shelter in Sterling Middle School.\n\n\"A lot of people started stopping by and telling us\" about the evacuation, Butacan said in an interview in the school gymnasium. \"A neighbor said, 'Hey, we're evacuating.\"\n\nThe Butacans fled their home with blankets, pillows and a few necessities, joining about a dozen other local residents at the Red Cross shelter at the school.\n\nButacan served two tours of duty in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, suffering injuries that left him 70 percent disabled. Operation Homefront bought the home in Sterling for them and the Butacans moved from Columbus, Neb.\n\nCarol Brom, Red Cross team lead for Logan County, said most of the 800 people evacuated had family or friends around they could stay with, so turnout at the shelter was light early Sunday evening.\n\nRuth Klein might have stayed with family, but her son, Andrew, was evacuated because of flooding in Loveland and her son, Bronson, was evacuated from flooding in Fort Collins. And a brother was evacuated in Aurora.\n\n\"It's like, 'Could you just leave us alone!'\" Klein said in the evacuation shelter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople coming to the shelter get cots and meals, as well as access to computers to register at Safe and Well, so family members and authorities can learn that they have been evacuated safely.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sterling-local_news/ci_24103198/south-platte-river-bottom-residents-take-shelter", "sailthru.author": "By Steve Buttry \n \n  Digital First Media", "ag": {"canon": "JournalAdvocate:article:24103198:view"}, "startDate": "2013-09-15T22:38:15-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "journal-advocate.com", "description": "A series of war injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan disabled Sgt.
