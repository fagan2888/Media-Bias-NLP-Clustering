But he also touched on religious freedom, a concept that his administration has been shockingly dense about. According to the President, he is doing everything he can to preserve free exercise in this country, because like it or not, it\u2019s in our Constitution, and darn it if it isn\u2019t important to the foundation of this great nation that everyone be allowed to practice their religion as they see fit, free from the roving eyes of government and public scrutiny.\n\n[[{\u201ctype\u201d:\u201dmedia\u201d,\u201dview_mode\u201d:\u201dmedia_large\u201d,\u201dfid\u201d:\u201d99263\u2033,\u201dattributes\u201d:{\u201calt\u201d:\u201d\u201d,\u201dclass\u201d:\u201dmedia-image\u201d,\u201dheight\u201d:\u201d272\u2033,\u201dstyle\u201d:\u201dfont-size: 13.008px; line-height: 1.538em;\u201d,\u201dtypeof\u201d:\u201dfoaf:Image\u201d,\u201dwidth\u201d:\u201d480\u2033}}]]\n\n[[{\u201ctype\u201d:\u201dmedia\u201d,\u201dview_mode\u201d:\u201dmedia_large\u201d,\u201dfid\u201d:\u201d99264\u2033,\u201dattributes\u201d:{\u201calt\u201d:\u201d\u201d,\u201dclass\u201d:\u201dmedia-image\u201d,\u201dheight\u201d:\u201d281\u2033,\u201dtypeof\u201d:\u201dfoaf:Image\u201d,\u201dwidth\u201d:\u201d480\u2033}}]]\n\nMaybe I\u2019ve missed something, but the Obama Administration hasn\u2019t exactly been friendly to religions that want to practice their faith in the public square \u2014 at least, religions that want to practice a faith that doesn\u2019t mold to President Obama\u2019s vision for how their faith should look.\n\nObama\u2019s message might play fine in more liberal spheres but you\u2019d be hard-pressed to convince, say, the Little Sisters of the Poor, who the Obama Administration is suing in attempt to force them to violate their religious precepts and provide birth control, free of charge, to their members and employees. Or Hobby Lobby\u2019s top brass. Or the many Catholic and Christian business owners who fought the Health and Human Services mandate that would have required them to pay for their employees\u2019 contraception, including abortefacients, regardless of how they felt about the practice. There, the Obama Administration accused religious business owners of imposing their beliefs on others, and blocking \u201cnecessary access\u201d to birth control, though they were simply asking that Administration find it in their heart to allow them to pass on absorbing their employees\u2019 costs. In Obama\u2019s home state, and elsewhere, Obama\u2019s supporters are trying to force doctors and hospitals who refuse to perform abortions to violate their principles. The Obama Administration has said, time and again, it would like abortions to be covered by the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid.\n\nBut when it comes to religious freedom in the abstract, well, he\u2019s all for it.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Obama Administration has said, time and again, it would like abortions to be covered by the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid.\nThis afternoon, President Obama, sensing that his media coverage had waned, gave a speech at a Baltimore mosque, partly to impart a message of goodwill and tolerance and partly to draw out all the crazies and give liberals on Twitter a new strawman to defend.\nBut he also touched on religious freedom, a concept that his administration has been shockingly dense about.\nBut when it comes to religious freedom in the abstract, well, he\u2019s all for it.\nIn Obama\u2019s home state, and elsewhere, Obama\u2019s supporters are trying to force doctors and hospitals who refuse to perform abortions to violate their principles."}
