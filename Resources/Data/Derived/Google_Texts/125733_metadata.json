It will again feature chest/breast screenings, diagnostic exams and same-day results, and informative presentations will be offered throughout the day on various topics like skin cancer, lung cancer and smoking cessation. A transgender Affordable Care Act coordinator will also be in attendance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to expand our audience and we\u2019re expanding the types of things we\u2019re offering,\u201d Gaither said.\n\nLast year, UT Southwestern saw about 15 people, but Gaither said the response from people who attended and the training of the staff helped Trans Pride refer LGBT people to the hospital throughout the year for services because they knew they\u2019d be comfortable.\n\n\u201cOur original idea was to expand it and grow it each year so that it became more of an LGBT community-wide health event for the entire LGBTQI community and something that the trans community could say this is us, this is our work for the entire community as a way of instilling trans pride,\u201d she said.\n\nScreening costs are covered by sponsors for persons who don\u2019t have insurance or whose insurance won\u2019t cover them. While people can call to schedule an appointment, Gaither said walk-ins are encouraged on Saturday.\n\nDallas Voice\u2019s coverage of the event last year sparked interest in other departments at UT Southwestern. Gaither said she expects more departments to participate in future years to again grow the event.\n\nVendor booths will include participation from UTSW Community Prevention and Intervention Unit, AIDS Arms, LULAC Rainbow Council 4871, AIDS Healthcare Foundation, Black Transmen Inc., Black Transwomen Inc., Human Rights Campaign, Lambda Legal, AmeriDoc, University of North Texas Center for Psychosocial Health Research, Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas, Parkland Health & Hospital System, Transgender Education Network of Texas and Lambda Legal.\n\nThe Out Healthy Fair is from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Dec. 14 at UT Southwestern Medical Center\u2019s Seay Biomedical Building, 2201 Inwood Road. To schedule an appointment, call 214-645-2526.
