Prague's mayor and the family of a fatal car accident victim say enough is enough.

Prague's mayor and the family of a fatal car accident victim say enough is enough.

They want a traffic change at an intersection an hour east of downtown Oklahoma City.

Holly Fipps' older sister Leslie Fipps was 24-years-old when her vehicle was T-boned, and she was killed, just after she exited Interstate 40 onto Highway 377 in November 2010.

Prague Mayor Cliff Bryant said while the intersection is eight miles outside of his town, Prague residents travel the roadway everyday.

He said the state Department of Transportation offered to install stoplights at the intersection a few years ago, but he said Seminole County refuses to perform maintenance.

"It's inevitable someone else is gonna die, and it's so important something is done. If this helps one family, it's worth it," Holly Fipps said.

News 9 tried to contact the Seminole County commissioners Monday afternoon, but were unable to contact them. Seminole County District II Commissioner Tommy Monks returned our call Tuesday, and said he's happy to meet with us any time about this issue, and we hope to very soon.
