The United States is the only country in the developed world without guaranteed paid leave of any kind\u2014and a quarter of women in America return to work within 10 days of having a child. Clinton\u2019s making it a priority to give new mothers the choice to stay home\u2014if they want to\u2014by fighting for paid leave.\n\nShe has pledged to stand up to Republican attempts to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nShe will fight to protect the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs a senator from New York, Hillary championed access to emergency contraception and voted in favor of strengthening a woman\u2019s right to make her own health-care decisions. She fought for legislation to guarantee paid sick leave and paid parental leave for all federal employees.\n\nWhat that means:\n\nPlanned Parenthood offers access to health-care services including cancer screenings; contraception; and safe, legal abortion\u2014services Clinton wants you to be able to access. She also wants to protect the Affordable Care Act, which gives women access to health services that were not covered in the past, or offered only via copays or deductibles. The Act forces insurance companies to completely cover services such as well-woman visits, gestational diabetes screenings for pregnant women, FDA-approved contraceptive methods, HPV DNA testing for women over 30, STI counseling, HIV screening, and mammograms. Obviously, Planned Parenthood is a huge supporter of the candidate, and a spokesperson told us that the group considers Clinton the only candidate in the race \u201cwho has made women\u2019s health and rights a priority.\u201d\n\nBernie Sanders\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the rights of women, we cannot go backwards. We have got to go forward.\u201d\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\nSanders has promised to nominate only Supreme Court justices who support the precedent allowing abortions set by Roe v. Wade.\n\nHe will expand and protect funding for Planned Parenthood, the Title X family planning program, and other initiatives that protect women\u2019s health, access to contraception, and the availability of a safe and legal abortion.\n\nHe will expand the WIC program for pregnant mothers and babies.\n\nWhat that means:\n\nMore than 40 years ago, a groundbreaking Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade set a precedent that protects women seeking abortions and now governs women\u2019s rights to terminate along with a more recent case, Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992). While Roe v. Wade has allowed women the freedom to choose whether they want to terminate a pregnancy for the past several decades, the legal foundation that it\u2019s based on\u2014to extend federal protection of a woman\u2019s right to pursue an abortion based on the 14th Amendment (your constitutional right of privacy)\u2014is shaky to say the least. Basically, it depends on a constant tug of war between that right to privacy and the state\u2019s interest in protecting the fetus. By saying he\u2019d only nominate Supreme Court justices who support the law, Sanders is effectively throwing full support behind a woman\u2019s right to choice.\n\nLike Clinton, Sanders also plans to support Planned Parenthood, and he\u2019s pledged more funding for Title X, a family-planning program that opened with bipartisan support more than 40 years ago and still offers clinics for low-income and uninsured patients and helps millions of clients every year\u2014more than 90 percent of whom are women. And no, Title X funds are not used to pay for abortions.\n\nHe also has plans to expand the WIC program, a federally funded initiative that helps out low-income pregnant women, breastfeeding women, and babies with nutrition assistance. In the past, Sanders played an important part in curbing Republican attempts to cut the program, and if elected promises to \u201csubstantially increase funding\u201d for the program. During 2013, more than 8.6 million low-income women and children received help from this program every month, and more funding could obviously expand the program\u2019s impact in a big way.\n\nDonald Trump\n\n\u201cI am pro-life. I support that position with exceptions allowed for rape, incest, or the life of the mother being at risk. I did not always hold this position, but I had a significant personal experience that brought the precious gift of life into perspective for me.\u201d\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\nTrump plans to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nWhat it means:\n\nRemember that precedent set in Roe v. Wade that allows abortion\u2014the one that Bernie Sanders is all for? Well, Trump is pretty against it, and he\u2019s also against the government funding Planned Parenthood. In February he released a statement explaining his pro-life views: \u201cThe Supreme Court in 1973 based their decision on imagining rights and liberties in the Constitution that are nowhere to be found. Even if we take the court at its word, that abortion is a matter of privacy, we should then extend the argument to the logical conclusion that private funds, then, should subsidize this choice rather than the half billion dollars given to abortion providers every year by Congress. Public funding of abortion providers is an insult to people of conscience at the least and an affront to good governance at best.\u201d\n\nRight about now would be a good time to highlight the fact that federal funding is not used to provide abortions by Planned Parenthood. That\u2019s been banned by law in almost all cases since 1976. Yes, Planned Parenthood offers abortions, but those procedures are funded by private donors and foundations as well as fees\u2014not federal funding. In fact, abortions make up only about 3 percent of all the services provided by Planned Parenthood, according to the organization\u2019s own data (and confirmed by FactCheck.org).\n\nHere\u2019s what a rep from Planned Parenthood had to tell us about their (obviously unfavorable) thoughts on Trump: \u201cDonald Trump would be a disaster for women\u2019s health and rights. He\u2019d rather shut down the government than allow over a million Americans to receive health care at Planned Parenthood. He would ban safe, legal abortion, leading to a whole nation that looks like Texas, where at least 100,000 women have attempted to self-induce their own abortions, without medical assistance. And without thinking twice, he\u2019d cut insurance coverage of birth control, meaning women would pay an estimated $1.4 billion more a year to cover their birth control.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz\n\n\u201cI am proud to be unambiguously pro-life, to support protecting every human life, from the moment of conception to the moment of natural death, I think every human life is a gift from God.\u201d\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\nCruz is against abortion, even in cases of rape or incest.\n\nHe fought against Obamacare\u2019s contraception mandate that demands all employers provide health care for their employees that covers all forms of contraception at no cost. As a congressional candidate in 2012 he wrote an op-ed for the National Review in which he said that abortion and contraception mandates were detrimental to \u201cthe basic rights of everyone\u201d (except women, we assume).\n\nin which he said that abortion and contraception mandates were detrimental to \u201cthe basic rights of everyone\u201d (except women, we assume). Cruz introduced measures to allow faith organizations in D.C. to refuse abortion services to their employees.\n\nHe plans to defund Planned Parenthood. If elected president, he says he will \u201cinstruct his Attorney General to investigate Planned Parenthood on day one.\u201d\n\nHe advocated on behalf of 13 states to successfully defend a federal law that bans late-term abortions (also called partial-birth abortions by right to life activists).\n\nHe successfully defended Texas\u2019s Rider 8, which prohibits state funds for groups that provide abortions.\n\nWhat that means:\n\nRegardless of your personal views on abortion, the fact remains that, according to the Guttmacher Institute, 80 percent of services provided by Planned Parenthood \u201cprevent unintended pregnancy,\u201d commonly to women in \u201csafety-net health centers\u201d that are the only safety-net family planning center available to them. Cutting funding to Planned Parenthood would mean many underprivileged women lose access to contraception\u2014a scary thought when you consider almost half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are already unintended, even with the current level of services available.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Cruz\u2019s very conservative stance isn\u2019t popular among women\u2019s health advocates who think that, if elected, he would compromise every woman\u2019s right to exercise agency over her own body. We reached out to sexologist Dr. Logan Levkoff for her thoughts: \u201cOur ability to make decisions for our body and our lives is a fundamental right. If a candidate wants to deny someone (because of their biological sex) personal autonomy and bodily control, than it speaks volumes about someone\u2019s stance on basic civil liberties. Access to birth control is not simply about who pays (as some people may suggest), it is about recognizing that the management of fertility is a health issue, no different from any other issue. Creating barriers to access connectives penalizes women and women\u2019s sexuality. It is a public statement supporting an old and ugly double standard.\u201d\n\nJohn Kasich\n\n\u201cYes\u2014I have always been for exceptions [to allow abortion].\u2026 For rape, incest, and life of the mother.\u2026 Because I think it\u2019s reasonable.\u201d\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\nHe\u2019s against abortion except in circumstances of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at risk.\n\nHe voted to ban late-term abortions.\n\nHe wants to defund Planned Parenthood and when he was governor, the Ohio Department of Health stopped awarding new state dollars to the organization.\n\nAs Governor of Ohio, Kasich introduced a state funding stream for rape crisis centers.\n\nHe helped create a $500,000-per-year Parenting and Pregnancy support program to counsel pregnant women and provide practical things like cribs and formula.\n\nWhat that means:\n\nAlthough his views on access to abortion and birth control aren\u2019t as conservative as those held by Cruz, Kasich still plans to defund Planned Parenthood. \u201cJohn Kasich has done everything within his power to ban access to safe, legal abortion and basic care at Planned Parenthood health centers. Kasich has enacted 17 restrictions on women\u2019s health, shuttering nearly half the abortion providers in the state,\u201d a spokesperson from the organization told us, referring to restrictions on women\u2019s reproductive rights that were passed and signed into law in Ohio during Kasich\u2019s time as governor.\n\nMarco Rubio\n\n\u201cAbortion to me is not a political issue, it\u2019s a human rights issue.\u201d\n\nWhat you need to know:\n\nRubio believes that Roe v. Wade was a \u201cpoorly decided legal precedent\u201d and wants it overturned.\n\nHe has a record of supporting pro-life policies.\n\nRubio\u2019s opposed to abortion in all cases except to save the life of the mother.\n\nWhat the means:\n\nBy announcing he wants Roe v. Wade overturned, Rubio\u2019s effectively saying he wants to make abortion illegal across the country. To put that into perspective, right now one in four women under the age of 30 will get an abortion, 45 percent of these women would have been single mothers, a whopping two-thirds are living in poverty, and 42 percent of women needing to terminate a pregnancy are living at 100 percent below the poverty line.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/presidential-candidates-2016-womens-sexual-health1.png?w=50", "description": "Here's where the presidential candidates stand when it comes to abortion and birth control access.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "StyleCaster", "description": "This, you need to know.", "title": "Cheat Sheet: Where Election Front-Runners Stand on Your Reproductive\u00a0Rights", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/presidential-candidates-2016-womens-sexual-health1.png", "height": 540}, "url": "http://stylecaster.com/presidential-candidates-on-abortion/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 55678606, "title": "Cheat Sheet: Where Election Front-Runners Stand on Your Reproductive\u00a0Rights", "image": {"src": "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/presidential-candidates-2016-womens-sexual-health1.png"}, "site": "@stylecaster", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "This, you need to know."}, "sailthru.date": "2016-03-04 12:00:53", "msvalidate.01": "7A34A1C1904BAFB83691E8B3718CA9A2", "msapplication-tooltip": "Style News and Trends", "sailthru.title": "Cheat Sheet: Where Election Front-Runners Stand on Your Reproductive\u00a0Rights", "sailthru.tags": "birth control, donald trump, election, election 2016, hillary clinton, women's health", "fb": {"pages": 48566051011, "article_style": "scdefault", "app_id": 134683123322801}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://stylecaster.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/f95e80beb275448b98a924f84cc3473a?s=16", "application-name": "StyleCaster", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/stylecaster", "published_time": "2016-03-04T17:00:53+00:00", "author": "http://stylecaster.com/author/jasmine-garnsworthy/", "section": "Culture", "modified_time": "2016-03-08T16:24:53+00:00", "tag": "women's health"}, "keywords": "election 2016", "google-site-verification": "yB_5UwT5pPNnn93Mba5HIaFkNtbrafDQWP_Rj34Iw08", "sailthru.description": "This, you need to know.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://scstylecaster.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/presidential-candidates-2016-womens-sexual-health1.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "She has pledged to stand up to Republican attempts to defund Planned Parenthood.\nWell, Trump is pretty against it, and he\u2019s also against the government funding Planned Parenthood.\nWhat that means:Although his views on access to abortion and birth control aren\u2019t as conservative as those held by Cruz, Kasich still plans to defund Planned Parenthood.\n\u201cJohn Kasich has done everything within his power to ban access to safe, legal abortion and basic care at Planned Parenthood health centers.\nHe\u2019d rather shut down the government than allow over a million Americans to receive health care at Planned Parenthood."}
