In July, he was brought onboard for a program headed up by Russian entrepreneur Yuri Milner, aimed at sending messages to life outside earth.\n\nNow, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute \u2013 or SETI \u2013 wants him to help with a similar endeavor.\n\n\u201cThe suggestion that Dario should be involved with this program came from several areas. It wasn\u2019t just from one person,\u201d says Charles Lindsay, founder of the organization\u2019s Artist in Residence program.\n\nSo, why are artists needed? Robleto sees it as an opportunity to provide fresh perspectives.\n\n\u201cI think when you analyze these things through the lens of art, new things come of it that wouldn\u2019t have come out otherwise,\u201d he says.\n\nRobleto joins five other artists from around the country who\u2019ve agreed to volunteer their time for two years. This Wednesday, they head out to the institute\u2019s home base in California.\n\n\u201cSome of the artists come in and say, \u2018I would like to work with that scientist and be influenced by them,\u2019\u201d Lindsay explains, adding that they look for certain attributes when choosing who to include. \u201cThey have to be great artists, very curious people. But they also have to be people that can work in a group, people that are interested in things beyond themselves,\u201d says Lindsay. \u201cSo, not that old model of the fiercely independent, egomaniacal artist. Those are not the kind of artists that we\u2019re encouraging.\u201d\n\nRobleto sees this trend of uniting the two fields becoming more common.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s something bigger going on here, but in my experience, there have been more and more avenues and willingness from the sciences to engage with the artists,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I often find that artists want to do that anyway\u2026 It\u2019s harder to get the sciences to figure out what we can contribute to them.\u201d\n\nSome of the others involved in SETI\u2019s Artist in Residence program include a photographer, a filmmaker, and a choreographer.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Arts & Culture", "description": "It\u2019s not first time the Houston artist has been invited to a discussion about communicating with life outside Earth.", "programs": "none", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Public Media", "description": "It\u2019s not first time the Houston artist has been invited to a discussion about communicating with life outside Earth.", "title": "Dario Robleto Named Artist In Residence For Program Of The Galactic Variety | Houston Public Media", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2016/01/10/133448/dario-robleto-named-artist-in-residence-for-program-of-the-galactic-variety/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08103636/Robleto-Image-01-1200x800.jpg", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08103636/Robleto-Image-01-1200x800.jpg", "height": 800, "width": 1200, "identifier": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08103636/Robleto-Image-01-1200x800.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "story_id": 462553250, "twitter": {"description": "It\u2019s not first time the Houston artist has been invited to a discussion about communicating with life outside Earth.", "creator": "@houstonpubmedia", "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2016/01/10/133448/dario-robleto-named-artist-in-residence-for-program-of-the-galactic-variety/", "image": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/08103636/Robleto-Image-01-1200x800.jpg", "title": "Dario Robleto Named Artist In Residence For Program Of The Galactic Variety", "site": "@houstonpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Amy Bishop", "wordCount": 385, "org_id": 220, "datePublished": "2016-01-10T06:00:26+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 37511993, "app_id": 1520489194943572, "pages": 27589213702}, "bitly-verification": "7777946f1a0a", "google-site-verification": "QOrBnMZ1LXDA9tL3e5WmFUU-oI3JUbDRotOWST1P_Dg", "keywords": "Arts & Culture, Arts & Culture, Health & Science, News, Artist in Residence, Charles Lindsay, Dario Robleto, SETI Artist in Residence, SETI Institute, Yuri Milner", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "Yuri Milner", "published_time": "2016-01-10T06:00:26+00:00"}, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think when you analyze these things through the lens of art, new things come of it that wouldn\u2019t have come out otherwise,\u201d he says.\nRobleto sees it as an opportunity to provide fresh perspectives.\nIt wasn\u2019t just from one person,\u201d says Charles Lindsay, founder of the organization\u2019s Artist in Residence program.\n/ DownloadDave RossmanWhen it comes to combining the worlds of astronomy and art, Dario Robleto seems to be in high demand.\nIt\u2019s not first time the Houston artist has been invited to a discussion about communicating with life outside Earth."}
