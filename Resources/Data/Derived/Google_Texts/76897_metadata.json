Last year\u2019s Republican presidential nominee told NBC\u2019s David Gregory that as president, he too would have demanded that all Americans have health insurance; but unlike President Barack Obama, he would have ordered the states, rather than the federal government, to figure out how to make that happen.\n\n\n\nGregory began the November 3 edition of Meet the Press with a clip from a recent speech in which Obama praised Romney for doing \u201cthe right thing on healthcare\u201d when he signed the 2006 legislation mandating that all Bay Staters have insurance. That law, of course, became the prototype for ObamaCare. In crafting the federal law, the Obama administration even consulted some of Romney\u2019s former advisors.\n\n\n\nGregory then asked Romney why he \u201creject[ed]\u201d Obama\u2019s \u201ccompliment\u201d \u2014 a good question considering that while he was still running for president and ObamaCare hadn\u2019t begun visibly imploding, Romney said he took it as a \u201ccompliment\u201d that Obama had called him \u201cthe grandfather of ObamaCare.\u201d Today, with Healthcare.gov barely functioning, insurance rates skyrocketing, and insurance policies being canceled left and right, Romney wants nothing to do with his \u201cgrandchild.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI think the president failed to learn the lessons that came from the experience of Massachusetts,\u201d Romney said. \u201cFirst of all, the Massachusetts experience was a state-run plan. The right way to deal with health care reform is not to have a one-size-fits-all plan that\u2019s imposed on all the states, but recognizing the differences between different states\u2019 populations, states should be able to craft their own plans to get all their citizens insured, and to make sure that preexisting conditions are covered.\u201d\n\n\n\nRomney also pointed out that Massachusetts \u201cphased in the requirements\u201d of its healthcare law over time to prevent major problems like the ones ObamaCare is experiencing, and he chastised Obama for telling Americans that they could keep their health insurance if they liked it. \u201cI think that fundamental dishonesty has really put in peril the whole foundation of his second term,\u201d he asserted.\n\n\n\nClearly, the fact that Obama was not forthright about his healthcare plan\u2019s effects on people\u2019s existing insurance policies was the main talking point Romney wanted to get across in this appearance. He kept returning to it every time Gregory tried to point out the similarities between Romneycare and ObamaCare.\n\n\n\nRomney admitted that his healthcare law had cost many Bay State residents their insurance and suggested that Obama had to have known the same thing would happen under ObamaCare but kept it from the public \u2014 as indeed he did. He also confessed that \u201chealth insurance is more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country\u201d and attributed that, at least in part, to Romneycare \u2014 something he was loath to do prior to last November. \u201cAnd you\u2019re going to see, as a result of ObamaCare, premiums going up dramatically across the country,\u201d he added. That, too, is already occurring.\n\n\n\nDespite all these negatives \u2014 not to mention the fact that Romneycare has caused such high healthcare costs in Massachusetts that the state has imposed price controls on healthcare \u2014 Romney still stands by his law as the right plan for Massachusetts, and possibly for the rest of the country. For all his paeans to federalism, Romney has long said the Massachusetts law should be a \u201cmodel for the nation.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn 2007, as Gregory reminded him by playing the tape of his appearance, Romney said, \u201cI think you\u2019re going to find, when it\u2019s all said and done, after all these states that are laboratories of democracy get their chance to try their own plans, that those who follow the path that we pursued will find it\u2019s the best path, and we\u2019ll end up with a nation that\u2019s taken a mandate approach.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe all the states should have adopted this, but you do believe that the entire nation should take a mandate approach,\u201d Gregory said. \u201cIf it was good for Massachusetts, what\u2019s so wrong with taking it national?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe obvious answer, that a federal plan similar to Massachusetts\u2019 is unconstitutional, did not escape Romney\u2019s lips, but he did again say that \u201ceach state should be able ... to put in place the plan that works best for them.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis at least sounds like a man who understands that the federal government has no business dictating healthcare policy to the states. Based on his answer to a subsequent question, however, that is clearly not the case.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat would you have done?\u201d Gregory asked. \u201cHad you become president \u2014 in my interview with you in the course of the campaign you said there were aspects of ObamaCare that you would want to keep, preexisting conditions, et cetera. What would you have done?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not president so I can\u2019t be so clear minded as to tell you what I would have done,\u201d Romney replied. \u201cBut my own plan was to say to each state, \u2018You\u2019ve got a requirement to move to a point where all your people are insured, and where you cover preexisting conditions. We\u2019re going to give you flexibility from the federal government level to help you be able to do so.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nIn other words, a President Romney would have sought to replace ObamaCare with ObamaCare Lite: a law enshrining the same faulty premises and mandates as ObamaCare with a thin veneer of federalism. This, of course, is no more constitutional than ObamaCare, and its effects would be roughly the same. After all, as Romney pointed out, ObamaCare\u2019s failings are the same as those of Romneycare; and by requiring states to enact some variant of Romneycare, he would have ensured that those failings were replicated in each state just as surely as Obama has.\n\n\n\nAnyone voting for Romney last year in hopes of ridding the country of ObamaCare got snookered.\n\nPhoto of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney: AP Images", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Mitt Romney, ObamaCare, Romneycare, Massachusetts, Obama, David Gregory, federalism", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/usnews/health-care/item/16885-romney-instead-of-obamacare-i-would-require-states-get-everyone-insured", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/763cf08d832a118efe6670513d53cdca_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Mitt Romney told NBC News that if he'd been elected president, he would have replaced ObamaCare with a mandate that states guarantee that all their residents are insured. by Michael Tennant", "title": "Romney: Instead of ObamaCare, I Would Require States Get Everyone Insured"}, "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/763cf08d832a118efe6670513d53cdca_XL.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf810\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s official: If former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney had been elected president in 2012, ObamaCare would still be with us, albeit in slightly modified form.\nAnyone voting for Romney last year in hopes of ridding the country of ObamaCare got snookered.\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re going to see, as a result of ObamaCare, premiums going up dramatically across the country,\u201d he added.\nHe kept returning to it every time Gregory tried to point out the similarities between Romneycare and ObamaCare.\nIn crafting the federal law, the Obama administration even consulted some of Romney\u2019s former advisors."}
