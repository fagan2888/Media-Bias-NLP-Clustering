It’s not news to say there’s a problem with target date funds (see “Are Target Date Funds a Ticking Time Bomb?” FiduciaryNews.com, Feb. 10, 2015). What might be more interesting to discuss, though, is just what will eventually replace these Rube Goldberg investments.



Sooner or later, the market will experience one of its customary dramatic pullbacks. When that happens, target date funds will come tumbling down like so many Jills after Jack. Retirement saver will cry, consumer advocates will cry “foul,” and regulator will simply foul things up per usual.

Smart advisers, though, will already have the replacement for these popular default options. The replacements will no longer feature funds of funds as the primary vehicle, opting instead for traditional stock and bond holdings. This will eliminate those layers of unnecessary fees, a benefit that will immediately accrue to the retirement saver. Furthermore, the replacements will remove the ambiguity of the meaning of “date.”
