Pressler, 72, served 18 years in the Senate from South Dakota before being defeated by Democrat Tim Johnson in 1998. Johnson is retiring this year, leaving a suddenly chaotic scramble for the open seat.\n\nA self-described \u201cpay-go, fiscal conservative,\u201d Pressler hopes to bolster the ranks of moderates in the Senate at a time of partisan polarization. He represents the sort of establishment Republicanism that has fallen out of favor in recent years as the tea party\u2019s power has risen.\n\nFor one thing, Pressler says he actually wants to work with President Obama.\n\n\u201cPart of my reason for supporting Obama\u2014it was for conservative reasons,\u201d Pressler said in an interview with msnbc. \u201cIt\u2019s been Republican presidents and Republican congresses who\u2019ve added more to the deficit, and Democrats who\u2019ve added less to the deficit.\u201d\n\nA member of the \u201cFix the Debt\u201d commission\u2014an outside group of fiscal hawks that received funding from prominent business leaders\u2014Pressler supports the Affordable Care Act because he believes it will help curb health care spending by helping to control drug costs and applies means-testing. (Subsidies for insurance purchased on the health-care exchanges are income-based.)\n\nHe believes Congress needs to pass similar regulations to control drug costs as well as means-testing to control Medicare costs as well. \u201cAll those things need to be applied to Medicare. Medicare can learn from the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Pressler said.\n\nLiberals may be delighted at the prospect of Pressler snatching a Senate seat away from Republicans, but they aren\u2019t likely to be happy with his focus on the deficit and entitlement reform. He wants to raise the retirement age gradually for Social Security (though not Medicare), though he denied wanting to \u201cbalance the budget\u201d by paring back the program. He also wants to amend Obamacare to include tort reform and said he\u2019d consider trying to overturn Roe vs. Wade.\n\nBut Pressler says he\u2019s also willing to challenge the Republican orthodoxy on tax cuts as well, calling the party \u201cpoisonously locked\u201d into its position on the issue. He wants a surtax on incomes above $1 million, as well as eliminating the mortgage interest deduction on second homes and certain corporate tax deductions.\n\nPressler says he needs to \u201ctalk to both sides\u201d before deciding which party he will caucus with if elected. But he says he would work closely with fellow Independent Sen. Angus King and moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins, both of Maine, and, if elected, Independent Greg Orman in Kansas. \u201cThe moderates have to take the Senate,\u201d Pressler said, citing his work with former North Dakota Sen. Kent Conrad\u2014a fiscal hawk and moderate Democrat\u2014the last time he was in the Senate.\n\nHe also says that he wants to work with Obama, whom he endorsed for president and first supported for his stance on veterans\u2019 issues. (Pressler, a Vietnam veteran, still suffers from PTSD.)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d be supportive of him necessarily; I\u2019d certainly want to work with him,\u201d said Pressler, who believes that some Republicans have gone too far in lashing out against the president. \u201cI\u2019m not going down there to say I\u2019m going to impeach you,\u201d he said.\n\nPressler doesn\u2019t anticipate that he\u2019ll receive an influx of outside spending. He also thinks that both Rick Weiland, the Democratic candidate, and Rounds will direct their funds toward battling his candidacy. But he also rejects calls for Weiland or any of the other candidates to drop out of the race to give him a better shot.\n\n\u201cI believe we should all stay in the race. I think we should work hard to state our issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not into this dropout talk.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Pressler represents the sort of establishment Republicanism that's fallen out of favor as the tea party's power has risen.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/meet-the-republican-turned-independent-giving-the-gop-fits", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Pressler represents the sort of establishment Republicanism that's fallen out of favor as the tea party's power has risen.", "title": "Meet the Republican-turned-independent giving the GOP fits", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/meet-the-republican-turned-independent-giving-the-gop-fits", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/ap374270132731.jpg?itok=94UGvCuM", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/meet-the-republican-turned-independent-giving-the-gop-fits", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/ap374270132731.jpg?itok=KD0VpT8U", "title": "Meet the Republican-turned-independent giving the GOP fits", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Pressler represents the sort of establishment Republicanism that's fallen out of favor as the tea party's power has risen."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-10-10T09:17:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "suzykhimm", "tags": "democrats,election-2014,elections,republicans,tea-party", "title": "Meet the Republican-turned-independent giving the GOP fits", "published": 1, "date": "10/10/2014 09:17:00 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/meet-the-republican-turned-independent-giving-the-gop-fits"}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Pressler represents the sort of establishment Republicanism that's fallen out of favor as the tea party's power has risen.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Democrats, Elections, Election 2014, Republicans, Tea Party"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f3d\"", "article_summary": "Larry Pressler, the former GOP senator-turned-Independent, has nipped at the heels of Republican front-runner Mike Rounds in recent polling.\nA self-described \u201cpay-go, fiscal conservative,\u201d Pressler hopes to bolster the ranks of moderates in the Senate at a time of partisan polarization.\nFor one thing, Pressler says he actually wants to work with President Obama.\nPressler, 72, served 18 years in the Senate from South Dakota before being defeated by Democrat Tim Johnson in 1998.\nBut he says he would work closely with fellow Independent Sen.
