(AP) - When Zel Vici opened his barber shop in 1935, Ron Roenigk was still 48 years away from being born.\n\nRoenigk, a 31-year-old graduate student at Penn State University in State College, traveled two hours to Nanticoke on a recent Friday to get a haircut from Vici, the 100-year-old iconic barber who decided not to retire at the end of 2014.\n\nRoenigk read about Vici in a Pittsburgh newspaper. Roenigk is from Sarver in Butler County and he is studying for his MBA at Penn State. Roenigk is engaged and getting married in June. He said he just might return to Vici\u2019s shop for his pre-wedding haircut.\n\nAnd Roenigk, like any good student, did his homework on Nanticoke. After his visit with Vici, Roenigk was heading to Sanitary Bakery, Tarnowski\u2019s Kielbasa Store and Stookey\u2019s BBQ - all legendary businesses in the Nanticoke area.\n\n\u201cI really like the family-owned businesses,\u201d Roenigk said. \u201cI appreciate the quality and the craftsmanship.\u201d\n\nVici\u2019s shop was busy that morning. Three customers plus Roenigk were there waiting for their turn in the chair. Roenigk seized the opportunity to learn more about Vici and Nanticoke.\n\nBernie Cywinski, 87, of Sheatown, has been getting his hair cut by Vici since 1945 - the year he got out of the military and returned to Nanticoke.\n\n\u201cThis guy just does a great job,\u201d Cywinski said. \u201cIf you come here, your coming to the best.\u201d\n\nCywinski remembers when Nanticoke had 30-plus barber shops. Now there are just three.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad Zel didn\u2019t retire,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where I\u2019d find another barber as good as Zel.\u201d\n\nRoenigk was busy asking questions and learning more and more about Nanticoke, its legendary businesses and its people. He said whenever he travels, he likes to discover the hidden treasures in small towns and get a feel for each community.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019s only one Stookey\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know there\u2019s only one Zel.\u201d\n\nRoenigk, who served in the U.S. Marine Corps, said he will be moving to South Carolina after his June 20th wedding to work for Amazon.\n\n\u201cHey Zel, will you still be working in June?\u201d Roenigk asked.\n\nVici assured him his intention is to still be open for business.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Roenigk said. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be back for a haircut before the wedding.\u201d\n\nVici qualified his assurance by stating \u201cif my heath is still good,\u201d but he smiled and said he would be happy to cut Roenigk\u2019s hair for his big day.\n\nDave Klaips of Kingston graciously gave Roenigk his place in line and the Penn State student got in the chair. He and Vici discussed how to cut his hair.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll leave about a quarter of an inch on the sides and three-quarters of an inch on the top,\u201d Vici offered.\n\nRoenigk agreed and when the clipping was done, Vici turned Roenigk around to see his new look in the mirror.\n\n\u201cGood job, Zel,\u201d he said. \u201cI like it. I like it a lot.\u201d\n\nAnother satisfied customer.\n\n\u201cZel has a tremendous work ethic,\u201d Klaips said as his turn came. \u201cAnd he does it right here in front of us and he has been doing it for 80 years.\u201d\n\nRoenigk asked to get a picture with Vici before he left. Vici was asked what he thought of Roenigk driving in from State College to have him cut his hair.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s a great feeling to have someone do that,\u201d Vici said. \u201cNow, who\u2019s next?\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1zrHeFJ\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Times Leader, http://www.timesleader.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Zel Vici opened his barber shop in 1935, Ron Roenigk was still 48 years away from being born.", "Author": "BILL O'BOYLE", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/24/student-travels-for-haircut-by-100-year-old-barber/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "When Zel Vici opened his barber shop in 1935, Ron Roenigk was still 48 years away from being born.", "title": "Student travels for haircut by 100-year-old barber"}, "twitter": {"title": "Student travels for haircut by 100-year-old barber", "description": "When Zel Vici opened his barber shop in 1935, Ron Roenigk was still 48 years away from being born.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0fd3\"", "article_summary": "Dave Klaips of Kingston graciously gave Roenigk his place in line and the Penn State student got in the chair.\nNANTICOKE, Pa.
