Authorities are searching for a convicted child predator who fled before his trial.

A jury found Roman Suarez-Leon guilty of luring a minor for sexual exploitation and for two counts of sexual conduct with a minor, according to a Facebook post by the Pima County Attorney’s Office.

The post stated that Suarez-Leon used a dating application on his phone to communicate with and lure a 12-year-old boy to meet him at a park.

After meeting, Suarez-Leon committed a sex act on the boy in the backseat of his car at the park near the boy’s home.

Days later, Suarez-Leon tried a second time to meet the boy, but was arrested by authorities.

He fled before trial. A warrant has been issued for Suarez-Leon's arrest.

If he is found, he will face life in prison at sentencing.
