A mental health group is calling "foul" on this edgy TV ad being aired during the NCAA basketball tournamentâ€”and wants it benched.

The new BMW commercial, highlighting the car's high-end communication system, is drawing heat because of its depiction of a couple scared off by a "crazy lady" outside a creepy house.

"I was really quite shocked," said Linda Rosenberg, president and CEO of the National Council for Behavioral Health, about the BMW ad, which was flagged to her by basketball fans among her staffers. "I thought they were a more sophisticated company, to be honest."

Rosenberg, whose group represents 2,200 mental health and addiction organizations, quickly fired off a letter to the automaker saying she was "deeply dismayed" by the commercial.

"I am writing to request you pull it immediately," she wrote.
