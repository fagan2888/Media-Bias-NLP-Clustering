He\u2019s also taking action.\n\nThe senator filed legislation Friday to ban anyone from returning to the United States after he or she travels overseas to join ISIS or other terrorist groups, according to the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nThe bill, known as the Expatriate Terrorist Act, is Cruz\u2019s response to Obama\u2019s State of the Union address, which the senator said showed the president is \u201cdetached from reality.\u201d\n\n\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s approach to foreign policy refuses to acknowledge the threats our enemies pose to our national security, is detached from reality and making the world a more dangerous place,\u201d Cruz said in Iowa. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the grave consequence of the Obama-Clinton-Kerry foreign policy unravel with respect to Iran, Russia, and now Yemen. That is why this week, I am re-filing the Expatriate Terrorist Act, which prevents Americans who have fought abroad for designated terrorist groups from returning to the United States.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "U.S. Sen.
