But as an employer, Congress fits into neither bucket.\n\n\n\nSo the workaround was a rule issued in 2013 by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management\u2014a federal agency\u2014that directs congressional members to enroll in the health-care exchange that was set up for small businesses with 50 or fewer employees.\n\n\n\nThe move allowed members of Congress and their staff to keep the subsidized health care they've long received for being federal employees under the Federal Employee Health Benefits program. The House and Senate employ thousands, and the personnel management office essentially had issued a ruling that contradicted the Obamacare legislation.\n\nIt wasn't long before legal challenges related to the rule began to emerge, with some contending Congress is pocketing a subsidized health-care care perk not intended for them.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Some are arguing Congress is pocketing a subsidized health-care care perk intended for small-business owners.", "news_keywords": "small business, shop, obamacare, kate rogers, congress, pocket, perk", "author": "Kate Rogers", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Some are arguing Congress is pocketing a subsidized health-care care perk intended for small-business owners.", "title": "The Obamacare challenge that won't go away", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/05/is-congress-a-small-business-the-stubborn-obamacare-challenge.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/03/06/102483719-IMG_0388.1910x1000.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some are arguing Congress is pocketing a subsidized health-care care perk intended for small-business owners.", "creator": "@katerogersnews", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/05/is-congress-a-small-business-the-stubborn-obamacare-challenge.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/03/06/102483719-IMG_0388.1910x1000.JPG"}, "title": "Is Congress a small business?
