If you slowed down this tape, you see what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want to believe that Mr. DuBose had done something violent towards the officer. He did not.\u201d\n\nThe footage from Tensing\u2019s body camera shows the officer pulling over DuBose for not having a license plate. Tensing asked DuBose for his driver\u2019s license multiple times before DuBose replied he could not find it, telling the officer, \u201cI have a license. You can run my name.\u201d\n\nThe officer eventually asked DuBose to take his seat belt off and began to open the driver\u2019s side door.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even do nothing,\u201d DuBose said as he pulled the door shut.\n\nHe began to turn the car on as the officer yelled \u201cStop!\u201d and immediately fired on DuBose, killing him instantly with a single shot in the head.\n\n\u201cHe purposely killed him,\u201d Deters said. \u201cHe should never have been a police officer.\u201d\n\nTensing voluntarily turned himself in following the indictment. He will be arraigned on Thursday morning and faces life in prison. The University of Cincinnati also fired Tensing after the indictment was announced.\n\n\u201cThis office has probably reviewed upwards of hundreds of police shootings, and this is the first time that we\u2019ve thought this is without question a murder,\u201d Deters said. \u201cCould you imagine the outrage you would have if this was your kid, if this was your brother, over a stop like this?\u201d\n\nThe incident, captured from the officer\u2019s body camera, will likely encourage momentum in Congress to outfit police with such equipment.\n\nA viral cellphone video showing a police officer fatally shooting Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, in Sen. Tim Scott\u2019s South Carolina hometown spurred the GOP\u2019s sole black senator to introduce police body camera legislation earlier this week.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The University of Cincinnati police officer who fatally shot Samuel DuBose during a routine traffic stop in July was indicted on murder charges Wednesday.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The University of Cincinnati police officer who fatally shot Samuel DuBose during a routine traffic stop in July was indicted on murder charges Wednesday.", "title": "University Cop Charged With Murder", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150729_SamuelDuBose_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-29T23:11:28+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1SNzNgx"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The University of Cincinnati police officer who fatally shot Samuel DuBose during a routine traffic stop in July was indicted on murder charges Wednesday.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150729_SamuelDuBose_Johnson.jpg"}, "title": "University Cop Charged With Murder", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "crime", "published_time": "2015-07-29T19:57:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-29T23:11:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Samuel DuBose, Ray Tensing, body camera, University of Cincinnati"}, "article_summary": "The University of Cincinnati police officer who fatally shot Samuel DuBose during a routine traffic stop on July 19 was indicted on murder charges Wednesday.\nHe did not.\u201dThe footage from Tensing\u2019s body camera shows the officer pulling over DuBose for not having a license plate.\nTensing asked DuBose for his driver\u2019s license multiple times before DuBose replied he could not find it, telling the officer, \u201cI have a license.\nTensing previously claimed he was \u201cdragged by the vehicle and had to fire his weapon.\u201d The video contradicted his account.\nThe University of Cincinnati also fired Tensing after the indictment was announced."}
