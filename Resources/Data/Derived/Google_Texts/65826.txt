"With my ACA coverage, I'm free to own my own business, consulting from home while ensuring I am able to manage my condition and stay healthy."

The day Deborah was laid off, she was wearing a 24-hour heart monitor. She has a chronic autoimmune disorder that requires continuous health coverage. Before the Affordable Care Act, a loss like this would mean paying egregious medical costs or driving from Los Angeles to Mexico for affordable medications. But the Affordable Care Act changed all that.

Now, health insurance companies are required to cover pre-existing conditions. So Deborah was able to secure her own health plan, and start her own business from the comfort of her own home. "I hope to leverage this freedom to become a job creator, growing my marketing business into something bigger than just a little shop operating out of my dining room," she said. "I'm not afraid of dying for lack of insurance."
