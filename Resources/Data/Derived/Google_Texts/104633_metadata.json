Even after Gordhamer, tall with a sculptural face and Errol Flynn hair, urged the group to \u201ccome into presence,\u201d his voice rising in emphasis, someone\u2019s phone was buzzing like a dragonfly.\n\nGordhamer started Wisdom 2.0 in 2009 to examine how we can live with technology without it swallowing us whole. The wait lists for his panel talks and conferences now run into the hundreds.\n\nThe \u201cDisconnect to Connect\u201d meet-up was typical. The audience was mostly young, mostly from the Silicon Valley tech scene and entirely fed up with taking orders from Siri.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when phones didn\u2019t tell you to do everything,\u201d Gordhamer, 45, said as the conversation got rolling. \u201cWhat\u2019s work, what\u2019s not work, it\u2019s all become blurred.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, the problem may offer a solution. Lo\u00efc Le Meur, a French blogger and entrepreneur and the evening\u2019s guest speaker, recommended a meditation app called Get Some Headspace. The program bills itself as the world\u2019s first gym membership for the mind.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a way to have a meditation practice without feeling weird about it,\u201d Le Meur said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to sit in a lotus position. You just press 'play\u2019 and chill out.\u201d\n\nThat morning at Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., Chade-Meng Tan, a veteran engineer, was laughing about the demand for an in-house course he created called \u201cSearch Inside Yourself.\u201d\n\nThe seven-week class teaches mindfulness, a loose term that covers an array of attention-training practices. It may mean spending 10 minutes with eyes closed on a gold-threaded pillow every morning or truly listening to your mother-in-law for once. Google naturally sees it as another utility widget for staying ahead.\n\n\u201cWhenever we put the class online, it sells out in 30 seconds,\u201d Tan said.\n\nThis is not just a geek thing. Everywhere lately, the here and now is the place to be. George Stephanopoulos, 50 Cent and Lena Dunham have all been talking up their meditation regimens.\n\n\u201cI come from a long line of neurotic Jewish women who need it more than anyone,\u201d Dunham, who\u2019s been meditating since she was 9, told a capacity crowd last month at the David Lynch Foundation for Conscious Based Education and World Peace in New York. Then there was the tweet in April from Rupert Murdoch, who announced: \u201cTrying to learn transcendental meditation. Everyone recommends, not that easy to get started, but said to improve everything!\u201d\n\nThe Marine Corps is testing Mind Fitness Training to help soldiers relax and boost \u201cemotional intelligence,\u201d buzzwords of the hour. Nike, General Mills, Target and Aetna encourage employees to sit and do nothing, and with classes that show them how.\n\nAs the high priestess of the fully aware, Arianna Huffington this year started a mindfulness conference, a page dedicated to the subject on The Huffington Post and a \u201cGPS for the Soul\u201d phone application with a built-in heart sensor to alert you when you\u2019re calm or stressed.\n\nThe hunger to get centered is especially fervent in the cradle of the digital revolution. Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz told Wisdom 2.0 audiences about modeling his current software startup, Asana, after lessons learned in his yoga practice.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the old San Francisco hippie fluff,\u201d said Tan, who started the Search Inside Yourself Leadership Institute in 2007. More than 1,000 Googlers have gone through the course, which uses scientific research and the profit motive to entice coders and programmers to be here now.\n\nHundreds of peer-reviewed studies verify the benefits of mindfulness training. Meditation thickens the brain\u2019s cortex, it lowers blood pressure, it can heal psoriasis and \u201cit can help you get a promotion,\u201d Tan said.\n\nTan\u2019s official Google title is Jolly Good Fellow, which nobody can deny. During the interview, he sat cross-legged and barefoot at a table inside the Googleplex, and was never far from an enlightened one-liner.\n\n\u201cPeople come to me with profound concerns like how do you get through 211 items on your to-do list,\u201d he said. \u201cI tell them, one item at a time, duh.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Meditation movement fights back -- tranquilly -- against the 'everywhere now' feeling"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ede\"", "article_summary": "Gordhamer started Wisdom 2.0 in 2009 to examine how we can live with technology without it swallowing us whole.\nFacebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz told Wisdom 2.0 audiences about modeling his current software startup, Asana, after lessons learned in his yoga practice.\nHundreds of peer-reviewed studies verify the benefits of mindfulness training.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the old San Francisco hippie fluff,\u201d said Tan, who started the Search Inside Yourself Leadership Institute in 2007.\n\u201cThere was a time when phones didn\u2019t tell you to do everything,\u201d Gordhamer, 45, said as the conversation got rolling."}
