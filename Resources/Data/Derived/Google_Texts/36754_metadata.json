State regulators blame the collapse on setting premiums too low, higher medical pay-outs than expected, and an aggressive enrollment strategy that brought in more clients than the cooperative could handle.\n\nCongress refused to inject the money necessary to keep CoOportunity in business. Iowa liquidated it.\n\nNow, 12 of the 23 health cooperatives established under the Affordable Care Act have failed.\n\nSmith says the co-ops aren\u2019t the only problem.\n\n\u201cWhen Obamacare first passed, it was a known fact that the bill was flawed,\u201d according to Smith. \u201cDespite that fact, we\u2019ve yet to see the advocates of Obamacare actually put forth a proposal to fix what they know is broken.\u201d\n\nA Congressional report says the failure of the 12 co-ops have left 740,000 people in 14 states scrambling to find health insurance. It estimates their collapse has cost taxpayers $1.2 billion.\n\nAUDIO: Brent Martin reports [:45]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Nebraska Radio Network", "description": "A Nebraska Congressman contends the collapse of CoOportunity Health, leaving thousands of Nebraskans without health coverage, disclosed real problems with federal health insurance law.
