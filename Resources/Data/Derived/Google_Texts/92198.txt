YouGiveGoods was launched in 2011. Since their start they have hosted more than 2000 drives to help people in need. YouGiveGoods acts as the conduit for getting goods from the people who want to help to the people who need the help. Their platform strives to provide an efficient way to promote and manage drives that support charities and organizations—like food pantries, homeless shelters and animal shelters. The YouGiveGoods team believes the easier it is to donate the more goods will be donated to charities looking for assistance. As part of the #GivingTuesday movement, YouGiveGoods has launched two national efforts. One a fresh produce campaign and the other for animal shelters. #GivingTuesday is the spiritual opposite of Black Friday, with the focus on giving rather than getting. Instead of donation boxes, the process is similar to creating a Wish List on Amazon or creating a Wedding Registry: you select the goods you want the recipient to receive then you invite friends to purchase them Commenting on #GivingTuesday, Patrick O’Neill, CEO & Co-Founder of YouGiveGoods stated, “#GivingTuesday is a battle-cry for people who want to give of themselves this holiday season. So far, we have seen an unprecedented response. Never mind the news of Black Friday brawls. There are plenty of good folks out there who haven’t forgotten what the holidays are all about. #GivingTuesday is proof.”

Christina Weiss Lurie, President Eagles Youth Partnership, Eagles Social Responsibility shared their experience with YouGiveGoods,

“Unfortunately, too many people in our community go without the proper food choices and essential supplies needed on a day-to-day basis. After partnering with the Coalition Against Hunger on the Green Light Pantry, we knew that healthy, affordable food options were needed. YouGiveGoods reached out to us about creating a food drive and we emphasized our desire to incorporate only healthy food choices. They were kind enough to create the solution we were looking for and we are very excited to get started.”

Scott Crawford, Assistant Director, Associated Humane Societies (AHS) – the largest shelter system in New Jersey, spoke on how YouGiveGoods facilitated their funding needs,

“We have a lot of animals in need of our help here. Not just animals that we find, but animals that are surrendered to us because their owners can no longer care for them. Going into this experience with YouGiveGoods, we hoped to raise $1,000 worth of goods. We’re thrilled that we raised more than 8 times that much, and we credit that to our wonderful supporters and YouGiveGoods’ new and easy way of giving.”

The animal shelter campaign allows donations to organizations across the country.

The Fresh Produce Drive is a campaign to provide nutritious food to those faced with hunger in the Greater New York, New Jersey and Philadelphia regions.

YouGiveGoods is operated by a group of people who strongly believe in helping others. They feel that by working together they can help create a significant change and positively impact the quality of life for the millions in need today.
