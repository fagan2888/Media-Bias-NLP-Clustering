When people with kidney failure are on dialysis, the main purpose is to remove urea from the blood.\u201d\n\nIn the case of hibernating bears, that urea is retained in the bloodstream and serves as a source for protein synthesis as the bears metabolize and live off their fatty stores.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of speculation on what is going on with this,\u201d Eustis-Grandy said. \u201cWe do know there is a reduction of blood flow in the [bear] kidneys in the winter, but we don\u2019t know of any documented specific structural [kidney] abnormalities and [documenting] that is one of the things I am trying to do.\u201d\n\nTo get all these samples of bear kidneys to study, Korstanje turned to Dr. Rita Seger, adjunct research professor with the University of Maine\u2019s department of animal and veterinary sciences.\n\nSeger has been studying bears since 2005 and joined The Jackson Lab project about a year and a half ago.\n\n\u201cRon got in touch with me and said he was interested in looking at bears [and] how they reverse kidney deterioration,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we started talking about ways to study that.\u201d\n\nSeger\u2019s own work put her in contact with sources for bear kidneys around the state, including registered Maine guides working during Maine\u2019s bear hunt. The guides were given special Jackson bear kidney collection kits with instructions on how to remove and preserve the organs for study.\n\nMoving forward, Seger said she would like to design a collection process for conducting field kidney biopsies on hibernating bears.\n\nThat would allow the researchers at Jackson to look at bear kidneys while they are going into failure and before they regenerate.\n\n\u201cI think the potential for that would be very exciting,\u201d Seger said.\n\nThe more information they can get from different times of the year, the better, according to Eustis-Grandy.\n\n\u201cI have a bunch of observational data, like the amount of blood in the [bear kidney] capillaries, which appear to change over time and when that particular kidney was harvested,\u201d she said. \u201cBut because we don\u2019t know where and when they came from geographically we are not sure how long they had been out of hibernation.\u201d\n\nThe beauty of doing the work using the digitized images of the bear kidney tissue, according to Eustis-Grandy, is that they can all be scanned into a computer and viewed from anywhere.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be able to get my students at MSSM involved,\u201d she said. \u201cThis study is going to last for years [and] it\u2019s going to take a lot of bears. They are going to have to look at a lot of samples [and] this is something we can have a bunch of my students doing for several hours a week.\u201d\n\nThere are still a lot of unknowns when it come to bear kidneys and any tangible results to benefit human kidneys are still a long way off, Korstanje said, but his team at The Jackson Lab is excited about the potential.\n\n\u201cAll we know is bear kidneys are barely functioning during hibernation and are perfectly functional in the fall,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what happens in between \u2014 we really have no idea. Finding a cure for kidney disease is certainly the ultimate goal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "BAR HARBOR, Maine \u2014 One of Maine\u2019s iconic forest dwellers may just harbor clues that could lead to better treatment and ultimately a cure for human kidney disease.Researchers at The Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor are studying black bear kidneys in an effort to determine how the animals are able [...] Maine news, sports, politics and election results, and obituaries from the Bangor Daily News.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "BAR HARBOR, Maine \u2014 One of Maine\u2019s iconic forest dwellers may just harbor clues that could lead to better treatment and ultimately a cure for human kidney disease.
