Vivian, SD

Authorities in South Dakota are investigating a vandalism case in which a portion of state-owned rail line was blown off by an explosive.



The damage happened about a mile east of Vivian in Lyman County. Dakota Southern Railway is the operator of the rail line.



Lyman County Sheriff Steve Manger says a two-foot piece of the rail line on the north side of the track is missing. He says the explosive that damaged the line appears to be tannerite, which is mostly used to create exploding targets during firearms practice.



Authorities say the incident likely happened in November, but they are unsure of the exact timeline.



The FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are participating in the investigation.
