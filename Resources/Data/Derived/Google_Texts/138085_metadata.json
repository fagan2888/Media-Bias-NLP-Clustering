But viewed in a wider context, it\u2019s easier to interpret McCarthy\u2019s remarks as a promise to restive conservatives that he\u2019ll be a more ruthless and distasteful political operator\u2014and more solicitous of the reactionary right\u2014than his predecessor. McCarthy\u2019s shoring up support in a way that should give Boehner second thoughts about his decision to resign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make this pledge to you,\u201d McCarthy told Hannity. \u201cIf I\u2019m fortunate enough to become speaker, the next three months are very difficult, it\u2019s a short amount of time to put a strategy, and we have unbelievable things in front of us. But I\u2019ll come on every single month if you want, or more, and you hold me accountable.\u201d\n\nBoehner, to his great credit, didn\u2019t feed the media beast that sought to destroy him. McCarthy, before serving a single day in the speakership, handed his gonads over to the most Limbaugh-like personality on Fox News, who happily placed them in escrow.\n\nHannity isn\u2019t after McCarthy\u2014who isn\u2019t a particularly quotable guest\u2014for ratings alone. He wants regular progress reports on a different promise McCarthy made to him.\n\nActually, it was four promises: \u201cDefunding Planned Parenthood, defunding executive amnesty and immigration, defunding Obamacare, and this Iranian deal is an unmitigated disaster that will lead to a modern day Holocaust,\u201d Hannity said, rattling off his top priorities. \u201cWill you tell conservative America tonight that you will fight to the end \u2026 to defund those issues and use the power of the purse?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, the answer is yes,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nHannity surely misunderstands a lot of things, but he isn\u2019t confused about the tools available to Republicans in Congress. Planned Parenthood\u2019s federal reimbursements, like the money that finances Affordable Care Act subsidies, can\u2019t be turned off without new legislation that the president agrees to sign. President Barack Obama\u2019s temporarily stymied deportation relief policies are similarly self-financed under current law. The nuclear agreement with Iran isn\u2019t a new expenditure or a policy that entails novel administrative costs. When Hannity says he wants these initiatives \u201cdefunded\u201d through the \u201cpower of the purse,\u201d he\u2019s asking McCarthy to attach amendments to annual government spending bills or the debt limit and to give Obama and the Senate a choice between enacting them or turning government operations and the economy into collateral damage.\n\nIn 2011, this tactic nearly hurtled the economy into a recession. In 2013 it resulted in a government shutdown that lasted nearly three weeks. McCarthy\u2019s promising to give it another shot.\n\nOn Sunday, Boehner suggested he\u2019s inclined to settle some of these accounts before he steps down. \u201cI don't want to leave my successor a dirty barn,\u201d he said on CBS' Face the Nation. \u201cI want to clean the barn up a little bit before the next person gets there.\u201d\n\nBut funding for the government will lapse in early December. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a member of the Republican leadership, told Roll Call that the idea of increasing the debt limit before Boehner\u2019s last day is \u201cprobably overly ambitious.\u201d If he\u2019s right\u2014if Boehner declines, or is unable, to beat these deadlines in the next month\u2014the outgoing speaker will be handing over these responsibilities to an untested successor who\u2019s already making promises to conservatives he can\u2019t keep.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "John Boehner's likely replacement as House speaker was a bit too optimistic on Fox News", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "John Boehner's likely replacement as House speaker was a bit too optimistic on Fox News.", "title": "Kevin McCarthy Is Already Making Promises to Conservatives He Can't Keep", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/f9b7d1b2351d4fe89982ebbd830313eb479c63ff.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/122984/kevin-mccarthys-already-making-promises-conservatives-he-cant-kee", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "John Boehner's likely replacement as House speaker was a bit too optimistic on Fox News.", "title": "Kevin McCarthy Is Already Making Promises to Conservatives He Can't Keep", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/f9b7d1b2351d4fe89982ebbd830313eb479c63ff.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "creator": "@brianbeutler", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/f9b7d1b2351d4fe89982ebbd830313eb479c63ff.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Kevin McCarthy Is Already Making Promises to Conservatives He Can't Keep\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/122984/kevin-mccarthys-already-making-promises-conservatives-he-cant-kee\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-10-01T12:26:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":122984,\"author\":\"Brian Beutler\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Politics\",\"John Boehner\",\"Kevin McCarthy\",\"Sean Hannity\",\"Election 2016\",\"FOX News\",\"Debt Limit\",\"Government Shutdown\",\"Obamacare\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2015-10-01"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ll make this pledge to you,\u201d McCarthy told Hannity.\nHannity isn\u2019t after McCarthy\u2014who isn\u2019t a particularly quotable guest\u2014for ratings alone.\nMcCarthy\u2019s shoring up support in a way that should give Boehner second thoughts about his decision to resign.\nOn Sunday, Boehner suggested he\u2019s inclined to settle some of these accounts before he steps down.\nHannity surely misunderstands a lot of things, but he isn\u2019t confused about the tools available to Republicans in Congress."}
