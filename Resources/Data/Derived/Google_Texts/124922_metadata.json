First-world activists have redefined themselves as anti-capitalist proponents of \u201csocial justice.\u201d\n\nSocial justice is not justice in the traditional sense, but rather a fancy pseudonym for what liberal activists deem to be \u201cfair.\u201d Traditional justice means equality of opportunity, not the equalizing of economic classes.\n\nIn his book The 100 Greatest Americans of the 20th Century: A Social Justice Hall of Fame, Peter Dreier glamorizes what he calls \u201cpractical idealists,\u201d a group of people who confuse fairness with equality of outcome, and hide their Marxist intentions behind the word \u201csocial justice.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that, as Hayek argued, treating people as equals politically, under the law, leads to different economic outcomes for those individuals. Social justice seeks exactly the opposite\u2014to equalize economic outcomes by treating \u201cclasses\u201d differently with regards to politics.\n\nThis paradox is apparent with modern day activists. They rage against capitalism, the very system responsible for raising the standard of living for the most people in the shortest amount of time.\n\nSocial justice is Marxism, socialism, and collectivism reborn and repackaged into the idea that Americans are owed health care, a job, a college education, and financial peace of mind. However, the cost imposed on all citizens to those things largely outweighs the benefit to some. In effect, taxpayers are paying government a transactional fee to redirect wealth in a way that is necessarily inefficient.\n\nAdvocates of social justice set out to fix society; however the assumption that one person (the activist) knows what is best for society is exactly the presumption that endangers it. No one person has the knowledge to create a pencil, much less a functioning society.\n\nOur most apparent systemic problems have come at the result of \u201cwell-intentioned\u201d social and economic tinkering. Think federal student loans, run-away entitlement programs, and clean energy subsidies. The Great Depression, like the 2008 financial crisis, stemmed from overzealous speculation and a cheap credit boom that prompted unsustainable investments, a result of money manipulation at the federal level.\n\nTrue justice means fighting for increased access to goods and services, not making those goods and services more expensive for the majority of Americans, as Obamacare, minimum wage laws, and anti-fracking protests do.\n\nDreier\u2019s so-called progressive heroes of social justice are actually villains to progress.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4199\"", "article_summary": "Dreier\u2019s so-called progressive heroes of social justice are actually villains to progress.\nSocial justice seeks exactly the opposite\u2014to equalize economic outcomes by treating \u201cclasses\u201d differently with regards to politics.\nFirst-world activists have redefined themselves as anti-capitalist proponents of \u201csocial justice.\u201dSocial justice is not justice in the traditional sense, but rather a fancy pseudonym for what liberal activists deem to be \u201cfair.\u201d Traditional justice means equality of opportunity, not the equalizing of economic classes.\nSocial justice is Marxism, socialism, and collectivism reborn and repackaged into the idea that Americans are owed health care, a job, a college education, and financial peace of mind.\nAdvocates of social justice set out to fix society; however the assumption that one person (the activist) knows what is best for society is exactly the presumption that endangers it."}
