Among the many comments scrawled in the small notebook were references to rape and lynching, recycling familiar narratives about entrenched misogyny and racism in fraternity culture.\n\n\u201cThat tree is so perfect for lynching,\u201d one note read.\n\n\u201cYou can never trust a n***** as far as you can throw them,\u201d scribbled another.\n\nAdditional entries included: \u201cIt will be short and painful, just like when I rape you\u201d; \u201cif she\u2019s old enough to pee, she\u2019s old enough to me\u201d; and \u201clet\u2019s go to Raleigh and yell at some n******.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was just a group of young men at state making jokes about raping people, raping children, raping dead women, making very overt racist comments,\u201d said NCSU senior Katie Perry, who handed the notebook over to local news station WRAL after her co-workers happened upon it.\n\nPi Kappa Phi\u2019s national organization has since placed the NC State chapter on interim suspension and issued a public statement condemning the notebook\u2019s comments. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable. It\u2019s offensive, and the things written in there are something we\u2019re taking very, very seriously,\u201d Pi Kappa Phi Chief Executive Mark Timmes insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s not consistent with our values.\u201d\n\nDespite repeated denunciations of bad behavior from national fraternity chapters and university leaders, however, incidents like the NCSU pledge book abound. This one is simply the latest in a series of high-profile news stories about fraternity culture\u2019s intersection with racism and misogyny.\n\nAt Penn State, the Kappa Delta Rho fraternity has been suspended over allegations that members used a private, invitation-only Facebook page \u2014 dubbed \u201cCovert Business Transactions\u201d \u2014 to post photos of passed out women, many of whom were nude. Similar to the NCSU episode, members of the fraternity commented on the photos with observations such as \u201cbanged her lol\u201d and \u201cLol delete these photos or we\u2019ll be on cnn in a week.\u201d\n\nShortly before the Penn state incident, a video of members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity at the University of Oklahoma chanting a racist song went viral, leading to the expulsion of two students and removal of the campus SAE chapter. The fraternity\u2019s national website boasts ties to the \u201cantebellum South\u201d and has come under fire for the racist actions of its members many times over the past several years: In 2013, the frat\u2019s Washington University in St. Louis chapter was suspended after pledges reportedly sang racial slurs to African American students; in 2014, SAE\u2019s Clemson University chapter hosted a \u201cCripmas\u201d party, named after the California-based \u201cCrips\u201d street gang; and in 2006, an SAE member at the University of Memphis left the fraternity after two other frat members harassed him for dating a black woman.\n\nThe recent wave of publicity over fraternity members\u2019 misconduct has reignited a discussion about the role Greek culture on campus and the lack of oversight and accountability for reprehensible behavior.\n\n\u201cWe are absolutely seeing a light being shined on Greek life right now, but these things are not unique to Greek life,\u201d said Allison Tombros Korman, executive director of Culture of Respect, a preventative sexual assault group. \u201cSexual assault or inappropriate behavior or inappropriate chanting or comments \u2014 those aren\u2019t just happening in Greek life.\u201d\n\nOther contend that while such social issues like racism and sexism are not exclusively contained to fraternity culture, they are especially prevalent there.\n\n\u201cI experienced different types of violence at fraternities,\u201d a former student at the University of Virginia told ThinkProgress. \u201cI got groped at parties, a guy threw me over his shoulders and dragged me up the frat stairs and I fought my way out of his arms. When I was dragged upstairs, I was shaking and said to other frat members \u2018he just tried to drag me up the stairs.\u2019 And they were like, \u2018go home, you\u2019re lying. You\u2019re drunk, that didn\u2019t happen. Go home. And they kicked me out the frat.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"It was just a group of young men at state making jokes about raping people, raping children, raping dead women, making very overt racist comments.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"It was just a group of young men at state making jokes about raping people, raping children, raping dead women, making very overt racist comments.\"", "title": "Fraternity Suspended Over Notebook Detailing Rape And Lynching", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/03/21/3637251/fraternity-suspended-notebook-detailing-rape-lynching/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-21-at-11.56.16-AM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"It was just a group of young men at state making jokes about raping people, raping children, raping dead women, making very overt racist comments.\"", "creator": "@E_Hellerstein", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-21-at-11.56.16-AM-321x214.png", "title": "Fraternity Suspended Over Notebook Detailing Rape And Lynching", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-21-at-11.56.16-AM.png", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-21-at-11.56.16-AM.png", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-21T14:22:23+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ericalhellerstein"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Justice Fraternity Suspended Over Notebook Detailing Rape And Lynching CREDIT:On Thursday night, employees at a Raleigh\u2019s restaurant near North Carolina State University discovered a green notebook that had been left behind by members of the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity on campus.\nAmong the many comments scrawled in the small notebook were references to rape and lynching, recycling familiar narratives about entrenched misogyny and racism in fraternity culture.\nWhen I was dragged upstairs, I was shaking and said to other frat members \u2018he just tried to drag me up the stairs.\u2019 And they were like, \u2018go home, you\u2019re lying.\nPi Kappa Phi\u2019s national organization has since placed the NC State chapter on interim suspension and issued a public statement condemning the notebook\u2019s comments.\nThe recent wave of publicity over fraternity members\u2019 misconduct has reignited a discussion about the role Greek culture on campus and the lack of oversight and accountability for reprehensible behavior."}
