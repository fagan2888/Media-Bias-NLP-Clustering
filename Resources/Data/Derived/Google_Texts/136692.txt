Planned Parenthood today tweeted out a celebratory cheer as the Supreme Court upheld Obamacare’s subsidies and saved President Obama’s signature healthcare reform from yet another near-death experience.

Prior to the ruling, Planned Parenthood urged people on Obamacare plans with subsidies to share their personal stories about the benefits.

“People who believe health care is a human right are shouting their personal stories from the rooftops,” Kersha Deibel, Manager of Health Center Advocacy Programs for the abortion industry giant wrote on its website.

Planned Parenthood has benefited tremendously from Obamacare, a fact acknowledged by both its president Cecile Richards and chair Alexis McGill Johnson in the organization’s 2013-2014 annual report.

“We’ve come a long way since Margaret Sanger was jailed in 1916 for opening America’s very first birth control clinic,” the group’s leaders touted. “Today, 99 percent of sexually active American women at some point in their lives use birth control – and, thanks to Planned Parenthood and the Affordable Care Act, more than 48 million women are now eligible to receive it with no copay.”

In fiscal year 2013-2014, Planned Parenthood was provided with more than $528 million – or 41 percent of its total revenue – in taxpayer funds in the form of government grants, contracts, and Medicaid reimbursements. The organization receives “navigator” grants to help HHS bump up enrollment for Obamacare, as well as “education” funding for sex ed. Since Obamacare is really all about expanding Medicaid, the organization has been extremely motivated to get as many people as possible on Obamacare Medicaid plans.
