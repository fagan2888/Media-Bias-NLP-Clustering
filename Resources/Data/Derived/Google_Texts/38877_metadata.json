(Photo: FILE PHOTO)Buy Photo\n\nNEWARK \u2014 NJ Transit board members are set to earmark storm relief funding and provide funding for private ferry lines at their monthly board meeting on Wednesday.\n\nThe board likely won\u2019t be faced with the stiff opposition that appeared in July, when the board unanimously voted to increase fares by 9 percent beginning Oct. 1. Much of the Wednesday agenda concerns routine housekeeping measures.\n\nHere are three highlights from the NJ Transit board\u2019s agenda.\n\n1.) More money for storm resilience\n\nThe board will likely earmark an additional $11.5 million to Morris County engineering firm BEM Systems, Inc., \u2013 already approved for $6.3 million \u2013 to prepare Environmental Impact Statements and filing for National Environmental Policy Act permits.\n\nSuch permits are required for the five major projects funded with $2 billion in relief from the U.S. Department of Transportation, designed to prevent losses like those suffered during Hurricane Sandy.\n\nA monitoring report analyzing how NJ Transit has spent its Sandy relief aid did not detail the \"observations and recommendations\" it found. NJ Transit denied an Open Public Records Act request by the Asbury Park Press seeking clarification on the recommendations.\n\nNearly $844,000 of the contract will go towards development of the Coastal Storm Surge Emergency Warning System, which will monitor extreme weather events that could damage NJ Transit facilities, especially its Hoboken terminal and maintenance complex in the Meadowlands.\n\nThe Davidson Laboratory at the Stevens Institute of Technology would provide raw data to the Coastal Storm Surge Emergency System. BEM Systems will develop a platform for NJ Transit to analyze the data.\n\n2.) Capital funding for private ferry carriers\n\nThough it does not operate its own ferry service, NJ Transit works closely with private ferry lines, especially those in northern New Jersey.\n\nTrain and ferry schedules are often linked to provide easy transfers. During emergencies \u2013 such as the rampant closures that plagued commuters in July \u2014 ferries often cross-honor rail passes to get commuters home.\n\nBut without public funding, ferry service is often looked at as a luxury that has priced out average commuters.\n\nEnter NJ Transit\u2019s Ferry Capital Improvement Program.\n\nNJ Transit already includes ferry statistics when applying for federal funding, but its Capital Improvement Program will provide a legal mechanism for the agency to provide capital funding to those private ferry lines, used for repairs or purchasing new equipment.\n\nLast year, NJ Transit approved a $2.5 million purchase of 10 new buses for NY Waterway, which provides free shuttle service from various commuter locations -- including NJ Transit stops -- to its major terminals in northern New Jersey. The company also operates ferry service from the Belford terminal in Middletown.\n\nIn July, NY Waterway founder Arthur Imperatore, Sr., said ferry funding could allow for lower fares, in turn providing another mass transit option for commuters.\n\n3.) Strict advertising rules\n\nSubmitting an advertisement to be placed at NJ Transit stations is about to get a lot more rigorous.\n\nNew rules up for adoption by the board prohibit any advertisements that \u201cexpress or advocate an opinion, position or viewpoint on matters of public debate about economic, political, moral, religious or social issues.\u201d The last set of advertising restrictions simply outlawed anything deemed \u201ccontroversial.\u201d\n\nTobacco advertisements of any kind are already prohibited but the new restrictions specifically prohibit e-cigarette advertisements.\n\nNJ Transit\u2019s current advertising restrictions read like a public school dress code. Ads posted at the agency\u2019s stations can\u2019t promote illegal activity or include graphic violence, obscenities or weapons.\n\nCompanies can\u2019t provide information that may be misconstrued as misleading, deceptive or \u201ccontroversial,\u201d which would promote vandalism.\n\nMike Davis: (732) 643-4223; mdavis@gannettnj.com\n\nWHAT: NJ Transit board meeting\n\nWHEN: Wed., Sept 9 at 9 a.m.\n\nWHERE: NJ Transit headquarters, 1 Penn Plaza East, 07105\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
