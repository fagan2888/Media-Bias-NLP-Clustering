He made this promise because he knew that the religious and pro-life community were concerned that Obamacare would make them pay for the killing of children through abortion.\n\nNow, in 2014 we know for sure their concerns were valid. Earlier this year, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a report that identifies 1,036 ObamaCare plans that cover abortion on demand and receive taxpayer subsides.\n\nThe GAO report also found that nearly all of the insurance issuers sampled are not itemizing the required separate abortion surcharge on its bills \u2013 confirming that the Obama Administration is ignoring the law\u2019s abortion accounting gimmick. In 2014, taxpayers are funding over a thousand Obamacare health plans that subsidize abortion on demand\u2014even late-term abortion\u2014in defiance of the Hyde Amendment the President publicly said he would honor.\n\nHowever, despite these facts, some Catholics still support the flawed healthcare system. In fact, a CEO at a Catholic Hospital recently acknowledged that she believes Obamacare is more important that protecting the Right to Life.\n\nAccording to Creative Minority Report, Nancy Steiger, the chief mission officer of PeaceHealth, a Catholic Health System, said she believed that Obamacare is a part of the greater good and therefore the abortion aspects of the \u201chealth care\u201d should be overlooked.\n\nShe said, \u201cWhile not everything in the Affordable Care Act fits Catholic social teaching \u2013 most notably birth control and abortion \u2013 the whole idea of access to health care for all is a fundamental Christian, Catholic belief. That is a greater good over what we disagree with. And abortions are not done in hospitals fundamentally.\u201d\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nAdditionally, as LifeNews previously reported, in 2011 the Catholic Health Association angered the pro-life Catholic community when it endorsed the Obamacare bill even though they knew it failed to protect against taxpayer funding of abortions.\n\nMichael Hichborn from the American Life League explained why some Catholics support Obamacare. He said, \u201cThe morally bankrupt provisions in Obamacare make it impossible for any Catholic to support it, even in the best possible light. By taking government funds to enroll people into Obamacare, it is clear that as far as Ascension Health and Catholic Social Services of Mobile are concerned, money is more important than souls. If the Catholic faith is to survive Obama\u2019s America, then sellouts like these must be reigned in by the shepherds of the Church.\u201d\n\nThankfully, however, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, has strongly opposed Obamacare. In a statement they said, \u201cWe are united in our resolve to continue to defend our right to live by our faith, and our duty to serve the poor, heal the sick, keep our apostolates strong and faithful, and insure our people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Catholic Hospital CEO: Obamacare More Important Than Babies Dying in Abortion", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "In 2009, pro-abortion president Barack Obama promised the American people that Obamacare would not fund abortion.
