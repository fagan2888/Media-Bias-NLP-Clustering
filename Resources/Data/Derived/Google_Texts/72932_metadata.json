Like women are half of the people on Earth,\" he raps. \"And yes they should've been equal since birth. That means all day, every day, equal pay, every way.\"\n\n\"And here's a SHORT clip of Emma Watson beatboxing while I freestyle about #HeForShe, if you only have 3 minutes. This was so fun,\" he wrote on Facebook alongside the video.\n\nMiranda and other members of the Hamilton cast recently visited the White House where the Broadway star freestyled for President Barrack Obama about Obamacare, NASA and the constitution.\n\nIn February, Watson revealed that she plans on taking a break from acting to focus on activism and her own self-growth. \"I want to try to talk to people who might not encounter feminism and talk to them about feminism,\" she shared about life after Hollywood. \"It's a really interesting job and it's a really interesting line to tread. I want to engage in the topic with people who wouldn't normally.\"", "article_metadata": {"rating": "General", "description": "Emma Watson displays her beatboxing skills with 'Hamilton' star Lin-Manuel Miranda.
