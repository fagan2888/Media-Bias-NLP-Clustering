We’re into the second week of the government shut down and lawmakers appear no closer to a deal than they were seven days ago.

While the administration spends its time trying to punish World War II veterans trying to see their own memorial in Washington, D.C., we’re finding ways to help you survive – and thrive, even – during the shutdown.

We’ve compiled these 10 songs to help you make it through each day. Some of the videos even include special dedications to key figures in the battle over funding Obamacare!

To the list!

Pitbull ft. Akon – Shut it down

—

Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers – Won’t back down

Dedicated to: President Barack Obama, Senator Harry Reid and Speaker of the House John Boehner, natch.

Key lines:

Well I won’t back down, no I won’t back down

You could stand me up at the gates of hell

But I won’t back down

—

NeYo – Shut me down

—

The Doors – This is the end

—

Greenday – American idiot

—

Simple Plan – Time to say goodbye

Dedicated to: Voters!

Key lines:

After all the things I’ve done for you

You never tried to do the same

It’s like you always play the victim

And I’m the one you always blame

When you need someone to save you

When you think you’re going to drown

(Think you’re going to drown)

You just grab your arms around me and pull me down

—

Tear for fears – Everybody wants to rule the world

—

R.E.M- It’s the end of the world as we know it

—

Billy Currington – Pretty good at drinking beer

Dedicated to: Members of Congress

Key lines:

A go getter maybe I’m not

I’m not known for doin’ a lot

But I do my best work when the weather’s hot

I’m pretty good at drinkin’ beer

Anna Sun – Walk the moon
