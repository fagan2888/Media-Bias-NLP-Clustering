Another 400,835 veteran claims are still backlogged.\n\nAfter serving six years in the U.S. Navy, Devon J. Avant experienced a delay in getting treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nDuring his service, Avant was deployed in the North Arabian Gulf, provided humanitarian aid in Haiti, and served with the Army\u2019s 101st Airborne division in Balad, Iraq.\n\n\u201cCurrently I'm seeking care for PTSD, which is a lot simpler to say than the bevy of illnesses that I was diagnosed with in the service,\u201d Avant said Friday. \u201cThe paperwork was just as simple as filling out a few forms. Appointments are pretty timely too. The only lengthy thing is filing for disability after you've been out of the service.\u201d\n\nFind Out Why Younger Soldiers Are More Likely to Develop PTSD \u00bb\n\nDisability Claims for PTSD\n\nHerein lies the problem for many in the Armed Forces: Medical personnel review a service member\u2019s medical records if he or she applies for disability during active duty.\n\n\u201cThe problem, like with me, is that most service members lie to stay in so as to not jeopardize their careers,\u201d Avant said. \u201cAnd when you're getting out, if you were considered \u2018fit for full duty,\u2019 you get your record glanced over and [you're] told to keep moving.\u201d\n\nAfter the appropriate reviews, Avant, who is classified as a combat veteran, was granted disability status and his treatment for PTSD is fully covered by the VA.\n\nPTSD, which older veterans call \u201cshell shock,\u201d is a major concern for the more than 2.5 million troops who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Since those wars began, more than 105,000 deployed and non-deployed service members have sought care for PTSD, according to military records.\n\nTwenty-one percent of troops who served overseas sought treatment from the VA for PTSD from 2005 to 2009, those records show.\n\nSee Why Depression Disproportionately Affects the Military \u00bb\n\nTricare for Active, Reserve, and Retired\n\nTim Khana of San Jose, Calif., served in the IRR Inactive Ready Reserve, Marines, 2/23 Company E, in San Bruno, Calif., from 2007 to May of this year. His unit served six months in Ramadi, Iraq, in 2009.\n\nThe son of a Naval officer, Khana has been covered under Tricare, the federal healthcare program for those in the military, his entire life.\n\nOverall, Khana called Tricare \u201creally efficient,\u201d but said, \u201cSometimes doctors are difficult to find because the practice decides not to renew the contracts.\u201d\n\nChanging Contracts Can Cause Problems\n\nTricare contracts are made with different clinics in order to give servicemen and women options for their healthcare. However, when these contracts change from year to year, it can create paperwork-fueled headaches.\n\nKhana experienced this first-hand this spring after the regional office TriWest merged completely with Tricare. During that time, he broke his wrist, resulting in a bill for all the costs from Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose due to a paperwork error saying Khana wasn\u2019t covered.\n\nThankfully, the error was fixed and fees were waived.\n\nAccording to the latest oversight report, Tricare rates better in overall quality of care than the private sector. However, the metrics of getting needed care, getting referrals to specialists, getting care quickly, and getting necessary appointments quickly lag behind private insurer benchmarks.\n\nAsk Yourself: Why Do We Get Such Little Value From Our Healthcare System? \u00bb", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/policy-how-well-do-we-treat-veterans-110913", "news_keywords": "Veteran's Day, veteran, army, navy, PTSD, disability claims, Veteran's Affairs, backlog", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "A disability claims backlog and provider changes for active servicemen are a few of the problems facing the men and women of the armed forces.", "title": "Veterans and Healthcare: How Well Are We Caring for Our Military?", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/policy-how-well-do-we-treat-veterans-110913", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/Veteran.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/Veteran.jpg", "description": "A disability claims backlog and provider changes for active servicemen are a few of the problems facing the men and women of the armed forces.", "card": "summary", "title": "Veterans and Healthcare: How Well Are We Caring for Our Military?"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-08", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A disability claims backlog and provider changes for active servicemen are a few of the problems facing the men and women of the armed forces."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf65\"", "article_summary": "However, the metrics of getting needed care, getting referrals to specialists, getting care quickly, and getting necessary appointments quickly lag behind private insurer benchmarks.\nSince those wars began, more than 105,000 deployed and non-deployed service members have sought care for PTSD, according to military records.\nThe son of a Naval officer, Khana has been covered under Tricare, the federal healthcare program for those in the military, his entire life.\nTwo recently retired young military men say their coverage is good, although\u2014as with private insurance plans\u2014navigating the bureaucracy is the most difficult part of the process.\nDuring his service, Avant was deployed in the North Arabian Gulf, provided humanitarian aid in Haiti, and served with the Army\u2019s 101st Airborne division in Balad, Iraq."}
