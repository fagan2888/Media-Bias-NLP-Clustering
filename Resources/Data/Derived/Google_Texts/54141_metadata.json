He needed a heart transplant that his doctors said he couldn\u2019t get, due to his \u201chistory of non-compliance\u201d with the legal system. They feared Stokes wouldn\u2019t take his medicine. But after his family pushed for the doctors to reconsider, Stokes was added to the transplant list and received the life-saving operation within the month.\n\nPolice reports show Stokes\u2019s recent run-in with the law began with a break-in in Roswell, Ga., roughly 20 miles north of Atlanta. An elderly woman called 911 saying someone had kicked down her door. When a police officer noticed a car that resembled the one involved with the break-in, he alerted it to pull over. Instead, the car fled.\n\nAfter an unspecified amount of time, the driver lost control of the car and crashed it into a pole, but not before jumping the curb and injuring a pedestrian. Later, Stokes was identified at North Fulton Medical Center and pronounced dead. Mack Major, a close family friend and mentor to Stokes, said the incident was deeply troubling.\n\n\u201cI was sure that he would be one of my poster kids,\u201d Major, who led the fight to get Stokes his transplant in August of 2013, told USA Today. \u201cI really did, because he was on the right track, he was talking right. He was doing everything he was supposed to do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "anthony, stokes, controversial, heart, transplant, patient, dies, police, chase", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Two years ago, Anthony Stokes first made headlines when he received a life-saving heart transplant.", "title": "Controversial Teen Heart Transplant Patient Dies In Police Chase [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/anthony-stokes-controversial-heart-transplant-patient-dies-police-chase-327890", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/04/02/anthonystokes.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two years ago, Anthony Stokes first made headlines when he received a life-saving heart transplant.", "title": "Controversial Teen Heart Transplant Patient Dies In Police Chase [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/anthony-stokes-controversial-heart-transplant-patient-dies-police-chase-327890", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured/public/2015/04/02/anthonystokes.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/02/anthonystokes.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-02T10:28:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-02T10:28:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Two years ago, Anthony Stokes first made headlines when he received a life-saving heart transplant."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe127a\"", "article_summary": "He needed a heart transplant that his doctors said he couldn\u2019t get, due to his \u201chistory of non-compliance\u201d with the legal system.\nThe Georgia teen who two years ago received a life-saving heart transplant died Tuesday after a police chase ended in the teen losing control of a stolen car.\nBut after his family pushed for the doctors to reconsider, Stokes was added to the transplant list and received the life-saving operation within the month.\n\u201cI was sure that he would be one of my poster kids,\u201d Major, who led the fight to get Stokes his transplant in August of 2013, told USA Today.\nAt 15, Anthony Stokes was on the verge of death."}
