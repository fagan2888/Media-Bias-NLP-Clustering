Rummaging through small-cap biotechnology companies, investors can pick out the next break-through drug provider, but it also leaves you exposed to potential flubs. Instead, exchange traded funds offer diversified basket to the growing sector.

“The jarring pace of change, single-product liability, regulatory uncertainties, and intellectual property rights make picking stocks in the biotech sector a high-risk/high-reward proposition,” according to Morningstar analyst Robert Goldsborough. “As such, we think investing in the industry via an exchange-traded fund makes a lot of sense; it’s a low-cost way to gain diverse exposure to the industry in one trade.”

The health care space could benefit from the aging population, rise in chronic diseases due to the older population, growing emerging market demand, new discoveries, increased merger and acquisitions activity, and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, or “Obamacare,” according to Zacks.

Looking at small-capitalization health care stocks, these companies focus on domestic exposure. Since they don’t have a large international footprint, they rely more on the U.S. economy, which could be a plus in case the world economy slows.

Moreover, smaller companies tend to experience faster growth, compared to their large-cap counterparts in an expanding economy. However, small-caps also see greater levels of volatility.
