Burwell, which seeks to prove that the authors of the ACA intended to write a law that didn\u2019t work. If the King plaintiffs succeed, insurance subsidies will only be made available to consumers on the state-run exchanges rather than the federal marketplace which covers most of the country.\n\nVery quietly another story has been unfolding, however, as numbers roll in from the law\u2019s second year of open enrollment. For all of Obamacare\u2019s status as the political symbol of our time, improbably unseating even Iraq, it\u2019s the people who actually use the program that tell the real story. How well is this law working, how consistently and for whom?\n\nA new study out of Kaiser has broken down the results of the second enrollment period. It\u2019s a subject we still don\u2019t know enough about, according to Kaiser\u2019s director of public opinion and survey research Liz Hamel, because implementation of the law is still remarkably young. With two enrollment periods down then, how is Obamacare doing?\n\n\n\nIt's stayed pretty much on track.\n\n\u201cI think that we found that things are pretty much the same in the second year as in the first year, but I think that was what was to be expected,\u201d Hamel said. \u201cWhat we saw was a lot of stability between the first year and the second.\u201d\n\nThis is the second survey of its kind. After 2014\u2019s open enrollment Kaiser gathered data on how consumers responded to their insurance and, with some variation; this year\u2019s data look remarkably similar. This is good news for the law\u2019s supporters, who have been fighting charges of price spirals and unsustainable markets since Obamacare first began to reform the industry.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "A new study by the Kaiser Family Foundation gets into the data behind Obamacare's second open enrollment period.", "author": "Eric Reed", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "A new study by the Kaiser Family Foundation gets into the data behind Obamacare's second open enrollment period.", "title": "Obamacare Satisfaction Is Up, But Consumers Are Still Worried About Costs", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/obamacare-satisfaction-is-up-but-consumers-are-still-worried-about-costs", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/obamacare312-large.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/obamacare312-large.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "keywords": "Obamacare, ACA, Affordable Care Act, Obama, health insurance, insurance, Kaiser", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "Kaiser", "published_time": "2015-05-22T12:18Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1611368"}, "date": "2015-05-22T12:18Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13161090, "twitter": {"description": "A new study by the Kaiser Family Foundation gets into the data behind Obamacare's second open enrollment period.", "title": "Obamacare Satisfaction Is Up, But Consumers Are Still Worried About Costs", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/obamacare-satisfaction-is-up-but-consumers-are-still-worried-about-costs", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/obamacare312-large.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/obamacare312-large.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, ACA, Affordable Care Act, Obama, health insurance, insurance, Kaiser"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9d57\"", "article_summary": "Very quietly another story has been unfolding, however, as numbers roll in from the law\u2019s second year of open enrollment.\nAfter 2014\u2019s open enrollment Kaiser gathered data on how consumers responded to their insurance and, with some variation; this year\u2019s data look remarkably similar.\n\u201cWhat we saw was a lot of stability between the first year and the second.\u201dThis is the second survey of its kind.\nA new study out of Kaiser has broken down the results of the second enrollment period.\nThis is good news for the law\u2019s supporters, who have been fighting charges of price spirals and unsustainable markets since Obamacare first began to reform the industry."}
