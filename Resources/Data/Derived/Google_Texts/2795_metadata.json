Later, when she began sexually abusing him, she was his sixth-grade teacher.\n\nInstead of taking ownership for the heinous acts she committed, Letourneau dismissed her responsibility by saying that he \u201cflirted with her\u201d and \u201cwas in love with her.\u201d\n\nShe ultimately pled guilty to two counts of felony second-degree rape of a child.\n\nMedia outlets have sensationalized this story, even saying that Letourneau had \u201ccelebrity status\u201d while in prison. Unfortunately, this story is not rare, and in recent years we have heard similar stories of women in positions of power and authority exploiting and molesting our young boys.\n\nResearchers now estimate that one in six men have had unwanted or abusive sexual experiences in childhood.\n\nThis equates to more than 19 million of our brothers, fathers, sons, partners and friends who are impacted by this problem.\n\nEven more startling is that these numbers are likely an underestimate of the actual prevalence.\n\nThe problem of sexual abuse often contributes to many of adult men\u2019s mental health, personal and work difficulties.\n\nStudies show that men who don\u2019t address those childhood experiences are at a significantly higher risk for a range of negative consequences, such as symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression, alcoholism and substance abuse, pornography addiction, anger issues, problems in intimate relationships and suicidal thoughts and attempts.\n\nThere are many myths surrounding unwanted or abusive sexual experiences of boys and men. So what are the facts?\n\n\u2022 Girls and women can sexually abuse boys. These boys are not \u201clucky,\u201d but exploited and harmed.\n\n\u2022 If a boy liked the attention he was getting or got sexually aroused during the abuse, this does not mean he wanted or liked being manipulated or abused, or that any part of what happened was his responsibility or fault.\n\n\u2022 Boys can be sexually abused by both straight men and gay men. Sexual abuse is the result of abusive behavior that takes advantage of a child\u2019s vulnerability and is in no way related to the sexual orientation of the abusive person.\n\n\u2022 Whether he is gay, straight or bisexual, a boy\u2019s sexual orientation is neither the cause nor the result of sexual abuse. By focusing on the abusive nature of sexual abuse rather than the sexual aspects of the interaction, it becomes easier to understand that sexual abuse has nothing to do with a boy\u2019s sexual orientation.\n\n\u2022 Boys and men can be sexually abused and it has nothing to do with how masculine they are.\n\n\u2022 Most boys who are sexually abused will not go on to sexually abuse others (www.1in6.org).\n\nWe want to shatter the myth that males aren\u2019t victims. In the last fiscal year, the Sexual Assault Center provided counseling services to 79 males under the age of 18 and 57 males over the age of 18.\n\nWe also provided a Male Adult Survivors\u2019 support group. We understand the impact that childhood sexual abuse has on boys and men.\n\nFor more information, contact the Sexual Assault Center at (615) 259-9055, use the center\u2019s 24-hour crisis and support line at (800) 879-1999 or visit its website at www.sacenter.org.\n\nConsider attending a Stewards of Children training, an evidence-informed training for parents and adults that offers practical ways that we can all be empowered to protect the children in our lives and prevent sexual abuse.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1HJmtt6", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "An estimated 1 in 6 men have had unwanted or abusive sexual experiences in childhood.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "An estimated 1 in 6 men have had unwanted or abusive sexual experiences in childhood.", "title": "Boys and men are also survivors of sexual abuse", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/05/26/male-sexual-abuse-survivors/27980351/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An estimated 1 in 6 men have had unwanted or abusive sexual experiences in childhood.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bafd6a28d85558e03e94c35d9cba275627f7b7e7/c=0-117-535-652&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/05/26/Nashville/B9317485486Z.1_20150526175140_000_GHFAT4T73.1-0.jpg", "title": "Boys and men are also survivors of sexual abuse", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Alcoholism", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Alcoholism", "title": "Boys and men are also survivors of sexual abuse", "author": "Amber Stevenson", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/contributors", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/45d86f65874f69d44fdc800a3fc0ce5546daba87/c=0-28-535-741/local/-/media/2015/05/26/Nashville/B9317485486Z.1_20150526175140_000_GHFAT4T73.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c05fc98e4e8fc71c8f1f3d1fe34266d61d6d8159/c=0-117-535-652/local/-/media/2015/05/26/Nashville/B9317485486Z.1_20150526175140_000_GHFAT4T73.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e1516bb50295760b0c7c9c87ca72c11a8dcba78d/c=0-184-535-585/local/-/media/2015/05/26/Nashville/B9317485486Z.1_20150526175140_000_GHFAT4T73.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/652a18b9570b2d95290f9f1ec0e71b21829ec1f3/c=0-234-535-535&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/05/26/Nashville/B9317485486Z.1_20150526175140_000_GHFAT4T73.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-05-26T16:51:40-05:00", "shorthed": "Males also survivors of sexual abuse", "articleid": 27980351, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8f610b541dddd4bc832d1c257c874199d5faa0c5/c=0-234-535-535/local/-/media/2015/05/26/Nashville/B9317485486Z.1_20150526175140_000_GHFAT4T73.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d5bca1076a00e597eb35f62bcce575c1fed09e1d/c=51-0-484-769/local/-/media/2015/05/26/Nashville/B9317485486Z.1_20150526175140_000_GHFAT4T73.1-0.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "sexual abuse, rape, male, men, boy, sexual assault center, nashville"}, "article_summary": "By focusing on the abusive nature of sexual abuse rather than the sexual aspects of the interaction, it becomes easier to understand that sexual abuse has nothing to do with a boy\u2019s sexual orientation.\n\u2022 Whether he is gay, straight or bisexual, a boy\u2019s sexual orientation is neither the cause nor the result of sexual abuse.\nWe understand the impact that childhood sexual abuse has on boys and men.\nA recent televised interview by veteran journalist Barbara Walters of \u201c20/20\u201d did a huge disservice to male victims of sexual abuse.\nThere are many myths surrounding unwanted or abusive sexual experiences of boys and men."}
