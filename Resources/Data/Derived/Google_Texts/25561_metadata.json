He and his wife, Leslie Robinson, 26, came from Moreno Valley to see the candidate.\n\nRobinson, who was discreetly nursing 17-month-old daughter Ruby under a shawl, said the couple is worried about affording college for their four kids. She also doesn\u2019t think the Affordable Care Act went far enough in getting more people insured.\n\nPeople began arriving before noon for the 2 p.m. rally, forming a line that snaked around three blocks. When organizers stopped letting people in around 1:30 p.m., some began pushing forward at the auditorium gate in hopes of getting inside, but they quickly became orderly again.\n\nThose who didn\u2019t get a spot inside the rally were told they could listen from loudspeakers outside or attend an evening rally at the National Orange Show in San Bernardino.\n\nBefore making his entrance in the auditorium, Sanders grabbed a microphone and stopped on the lower level to speak to supporters who weren\u2019t able to get in.\n\nInside the main event, the crowd periodically chanted, \u201cThis is what democracy looks like,\u201d and \u201cBer-nie! Ber-nie! Ber-nie!\u201d while waiting for the speech to begin.\n\nSanders hit many of the same notes as in other Southern California appearances, touching on problems such as Flint, Michigan\u2019s contaminated water supply, the nationwide opiate addiction epidemic and a \u201cbroken criminal justice system\u201d that disproportionately punishes Latinos, blacks and Native Americans.\n\nThe crowd roared in appreciation when Sanders said marijuana should be removed from the federal list that says it\u2019s as dangerous as heroin, and they cheered for the idea that drug addiction \u201cshould not be seen as a crime issue, but as a health issue.\u201d Legalization of marijuana should be a state issue, Sanders said.\n\nThe candidate proposed expanding Social Security and offering paid family leave for new moms, and he promised to support a path to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented people in the U.S.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "sailthru.author": "ALICIA ROBINSON and STEPHEN WALL", "content_author": "ALICIA ROBINSON and STEPHEN WALL", "ICBM": "33.948100, -117.396100", "sailthru.tags": "news, sanders, disney, see, riverside, working, downtown, people, crowd, auditorium, mission", "content_section": "news", "content_title": "DECISION 2016: Bernie Sanders promises change at Inland rallies", "geo.position": "33.948100;-117.396100", "author": "ALICIA ROBINSON and STEPHEN WALL", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-05-24 12:19:29", "sailthru.title": "DECISION 2016: Bernie Sanders promises change at Inland rallies", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/o7p78n-bernieinside1.jpg", "geo.placename": "Riverside", "fb": {"app_id": 1413700038878423}, "content_thumbnail": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/o7p78n-bernieinside1.jpg", "content_type": "article", "publication_date": "2016-05-24", "Description": "News: DECISION 2016: Crowds line up to see Bernie Sanders | sanders, disney, see, riverside, working, downtown, people, crowd, auditorium, mission", "og": {"site_name": "Press Enterprise", "description": "News: DECISION 2016: Crowds line up to see Bernie Sanders | sanders, disney, see, riverside, working, downtown, people, crowd, auditorium, mission", "title": "DECISION 2016: Bernie Sanders promises change at Inland rallies", "locale": "en", "image": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/article/o7p78n-bernieinside1.jpg", "url": "http://www.pe.com/articles/sanders-803773-disney-see.html", "type": "article"}, "Keywords": "sanders, disney, see, riverside, working, downtown, people, crowd, auditorium, mission", "sailthru.image.full": "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/o7p78n-bernieinside1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders told an enthusiastic Riverside crowd that political change requires struggle, but their efforts will help make the country a better place for everyone in it.\nBefore making his entrance in the auditorium, Sanders grabbed a microphone and stopped on the lower level to speak to supporters who weren\u2019t able to get in.\nSanders\u2019 campaign is about \u201cputting the power of the government back in the hands of the people,\u201d said Justin Myers, 28.\nInside the main event, the crowd periodically chanted, \u201cThis is what democracy looks like,\u201d and \u201cBer-nie!\nPeople began arriving before noon for the 2 p.m. rally, forming a line that snaked around three blocks."}
