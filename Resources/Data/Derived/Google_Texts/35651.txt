There was little change this year among the top schools on U.S. News & World Report’s Best Graduate School 2015 rankings released this week.

Harvard, Stanford and the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania all tied for the top spot on the list. Wharton, in third place last year, moved up to tie the other two schools.

Movement among the other Top 10 schools included the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago rising from 6th to 4th place, while the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University fell from 4th to 6th.

The biggest movement came from lower on the list, where the Lindner College of Business at the University of Cincinnati climbed from 99th to 60th place.

The list is important for those looking for the right business school to attend. These are the best of the best, according to U.S. News. The Top 10 schools, with the annual tuition, are listed below. Keep in mind while the cost might seem high, there are many scholarships and federal grants available for those in need of financial aid.

Additionally, many private schools offer tuition aid to students who qualify for the school but do not have the financial resources to pay the full tuition.
