Ted Cruz, R-Texas, aimed to differentiate himself from the crowded 2016 GOP presidential field during a fiery speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference Thursday in Maryland. While not mentioning other possible candidates by name, Cruz argued that he has fought for conservative principles while others have no record of action to back up their conservative credentials.\n\nCruz said it was \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cterrific\u201d for CPAC speakers to say they opposed Obamacare or want to rein in the national debt. But \u201cif you\u2019re really conservative, you will have been in the trenches, you will have bared the scars, you will have fought the fight,\u201d he told a packed crowd at CPAC, the conservative movement\u2019s largest annual event and a place where prospective candidates often go to test their message for the Republican base.\n\nCruz, who hasn\u2019t officially started a campaign for the presidency, said the country \u201cis in jeopardy\u201d and that Republicans can win only if they reassemble the coalition of Republicans and Reagan Democrats. \u201cWe need to run a populist campaign standing for hard-working men and women,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to take the power out of Washington and bring it back to the American people.\u201d Cruz said the biggest divide in the country isn\u2019t between Republicans and Democrats, but \u201cbetween career politicians in Washington and the American people.\u201d\n\nThe Texas senator also ripped into President Barack Obama\u2019s health care agenda and the president\u2019s refusal to call the actions of the Islamic State group Islamic terrorism. \u201cObamacare is a train wreck, and that\u2019s actually not fair to train wrecks,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz also took a swipe at Hillary Clinton, the presumed Democratic frontrunner. \u201cHillary Clinton embodies the corruption of Washington,\u201d he said. In a short question-and-answer session with Fox News host Sean Hannity in which Cruz was asked to describe Clinton in one word, he said, \u201cWashington.\u201d He also characterized Obama as a \u201clawless imperator.\u201d\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nAs one of the most conservative members of the Senate, Cruz is behind the strategy to tie funding for the Department of Homeland Security with a bill that rescinds Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration. Cruz accused his Republican colleagues of caving in after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., offered a plan Tuesday to consider the issues in separate bills -- a strategy that Cruz is at odds with. \u201cUnfortunately, Republican leadership is standing with [Senate Minority Leader] Harry Reid and the Democrats to give in on executive amnesty and the question, \u2018Why?\u2019, is because they\u2019re not listening to you,\u201d he said, referring to the American people.\n\nIf he becomes president, Cruz said his top priority would be to \u201crepeal every blasted word of Obamacare,\u201d followed by abolishing the IRS, stopping \u201cout-of-control regulators at the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] and the alphabet soup of Washington,\u201d defending constitutional rights and restoring \u201cAmerica\u2019s leadership in the world as a shining city on a hill.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ted cruz. ted cruz 2016, ted cruz cpac, ted cruz cpac speech, ted cruz cpac speech 2015, ted cruz's speech at cpac, ted cruz speech to cpac, what did ted cruz say at cpac, ted cruz cpac address, ted cruz 2015 cpac address, conservative political action", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "\"If you're really conservative, you would have been in the trenches,\" the Texan said.", "title": "Ted Cruz 2015 CPAC Speech: 'Obamacare Is A Train Wreck,' Hillary 'Embodies The Corruption Of Washington'", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/ted-cruz-2015-cpac-speech-obamacare-train-wreck-hillary-embodies-corruption-1829850", "image": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/02/26/ted-cruz_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"If you're really conservative, you would have been in the trenches,\" the Texan said.", "title": "Ted Cruz 2015 CPAC Speech: 'Obamacare Is A Train Wreck,' Hillary 'Embodies The Corruption Of Washington'", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.com/ted-cruz-2015-cpac-speech-obamacare-train-wreck-hillary-embodies-corruption-1829850", "image": {"src": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/02/26/ted-cruz_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2015/02/26/ted-cruz_0.jpg"}, "site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "World", "published_time": "2015-02-26T15:28:15-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-26T16:03:36-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\"If you're really conservative, you would have been in the trenches,\" the Texan said."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe02ae\"", "article_summary": "\u201cObamacare is a train wreck, and that\u2019s actually not fair to train wrecks,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHillary Clinton embodies the corruption of Washington,\u201d he said.\nCruz said it was \u201cfantastic\u201d and \u201cterrific\u201d for CPAC speakers to say they opposed Obamacare or want to rein in the national debt.\nCruz also took a swipe at Hillary Clinton, the presumed Democratic frontrunner.\nWhile not mentioning other possible candidates by name, Cruz argued that he has fought for conservative principles while others have no record of action to back up their conservative credentials."}
