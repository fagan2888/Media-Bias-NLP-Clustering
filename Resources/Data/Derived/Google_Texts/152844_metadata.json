The director, David Leveaux, is prepared for the fans of Legolas (the elven hero Mr. Bloom portrayed in \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d trilogy), but he thinks they will appreciate what Shakespeare\u2019s play, in his view, is really about: clueless parents. \u201cFor people who think of the play as just about this love story, one of the surprising, radical things is what it has to show you about family dynamics,\u201d said Mr. Leveaux. \u201cThis is a play in which there is a cavernous gap between parents and their children. The children are almost strangers to their parents.\u201d\n\nListen to Ms. Catton and Mr. Deal discuss the play below or at this link.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Pia Catton and WSJ This Morning's Gordon Deal discuss a new interpretation of Romeo & Juliet.", "title": "New \u2013 And Old \u2013 Twists In Romeo & Juliet", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/09/19/new-and-old-twists-in-rome-juliet/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/NY-CO884_ROMEO_G_20130918184037.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "New \u2013 And Old \u2013 Twists In Romeo & Juliet", "description": "Pia Catton and WSJ This Morning's Gordon Deal discuss a new interpretation of Romeo & Juliet.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "WSJ Staff", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "Pia Catton and WSJ This Morning's Gordon Deal discuss a new interpretation of Romeo & Juliet.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-19T20:41:28-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/09/19/new-and-old-twists-in-rome-juliet/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-18546", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Pia Catton and WSJ This Morning's Gordon Deal discuss a new interpretation of Romeo & Juliet.", "title": "New \u2013 And Old \u2013 Twists In Romeo & Juliet", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/09/19/new-and-old-twists-in-rome-juliet/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/NY-CO884_ROMEO_G_20130918184037.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-18546", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-20T18:36:09-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd999b\"", "article_summary": "Pia Catton and WSJ This Morning\u2019s Gordon Deal discuss this new interpretation of Romeo & Juliet.\nRobert Ascroft Orlando Bloom and Condola Rashad as Romeo and Juliet.\nIn her article on the play, Raising \u2018Romeo\u2019 Above Its Stars, which appeared in Thursday\u2019s paper, Ms. Catton writes:The buzz around \u201cRomeo and Juliet,\u201d opening Thursday on Broadway, is all about the casting of its movie-star Romeo, Orlando Bloom, and Condola Rashad, who is African American, as Juliet.\nDespite all the buzz about the casting, David Leveaux, director of the latest production of Romeo and Juliet to hit Broadway, says the play\u2019s most radical aspect is its exploration of family dynamics.\nThe children are almost strangers to their parents.\u201dListen to Ms. Catton and Mr. Deal discuss the play below or at this link."}
