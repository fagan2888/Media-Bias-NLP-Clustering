The college students I teach have only a hazy knowledge of Selma and its impact on the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nToday, though, Selma has taken on new relevance as it approaches its 50th anniversary. The failures of grand juries in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York, to indict the police officers whose actions led to the deaths of two unarmed black men has made the gross injustices the civil rights movement fought against in the \u201960s seem part of our times.\n\nI am not nostalgic about Selma, but I am struck by how, despite the explicit racism of the South in 1965, there was more optimism then about America\u2019s racial future than we have today. In New York, where I live, nightly #blacklivesmatter marches protesting events in Ferguson and Staten Island have been able to disrupt the city to a degree unthinkable 50 years ago, but among the marchers with whom I have spoken, their hopes are modest and specific. They want to change how policing is done in communities of color, and they are calling for special prosecutors in cases of alleged police misconduct. Few, though, speak of a new racial day in America arriving any time soon.\n\nIn 1965 I was far less sophisticated politically than today\u2019s marchers. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s Southern Christian Leadership Conference had been conducting a voter registration campaign in Selma since January 1965, but my awareness of SCLC\u2019s efforts did not come until the night of March 7. That was the date on which everything to do with Selma changed. Shortly after 9 o\u2019clock, ABC interrupted its Sunday evening movie,\u201dJudgment at Nuremberg, with pictures from Selma that showed Alabama State Troopers attacking a column of black demonstrators while jeering crowds rooted the troopers on.\n\nWhat shocked me about the attack, which quickly became known as \u201cBloody Sunday,\u201d was that the troopers made no effort to conceal their actions from the television cameras. They were confident they would not be called to account.\n\nThe story of Selma has been told movingly by a number of historians \u2014 particularly, David Garrow in \u201cProtest at Selma\u201d and Taylor Branch in \u201cAt Canaan\u2019s Edge: America in the King Years 1965-68.\u201d But in March 1965 when I cut my graduate classes at Brown and headed south, I had little sense that a historic undertaking was about to happen. A second protest march, this one on March 9, had been peaceably turned around, and I worried that the March 21 march might remain small, even with Martin Luther King and a series of celebrities heading it.\n\nI was encouraged by the fact that on March 15, in a nationwide television address, President Johnson announced that he was sending a voting rights bill to Congress, and I took heart from the fact that Johnson followed up his address by calling out the Alabama National Guard to protect the March 21 march. Nonetheless, when I got to Selma on the night before the march, my worries continued.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Despite the South's explicit racism, the civil rights fight brought hope.
