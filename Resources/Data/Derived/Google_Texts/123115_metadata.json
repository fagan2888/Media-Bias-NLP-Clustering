That it came just six months before Emanuel will ask Chicago voters to give him a second term was not lost on his potential opponents.\n\n\u201cThe problem is, he doesn\u2019t have a progressive record,\u201d said Chicago Teachers Union President Karen Lewis, who is exploring a run against Emanuel. \u201cMy question is, why did it take you three and a half years to discover universal pre-K? Why did it take you three and a half years to discover a minimum wage? Because you were busy doing what? Closing schools, demoralizing the police department and creating a mess. That\u2019s his real record.\u201d\n\nEmanuel, however, said his trip to New York wasn\u2019t about his own political jockeying, but about a focus on issues he said were in concert with \u201ceverything I\u2019ve done my whole life.\u201d\n\nEmanuel touts progressive issues with de Blasio in NYC Brian Harkin Mayor Rahm Emanuel shakes hands with New York Mayor Bill de Blasio during a U.S. Conference of Mayors task force meeting at Gracie Mansion on Monday.

(Brian Harkin)\n\nHistorically, the Emanuel administration has not told the public of the mayor\u2019s frequent out-of-state trips until he\u2019s on the ground a time zone or two away. This time, the mayor\u2019s top aides sought to showcase their boss\u2019 New York appearance, offering advanced notice to two Chicago reporters and inviting them to attend the event.\n\nWith Gracie Mansion\u2019s marble fireplaces, sky blue walls and towering white columns as the backdrop, Emanuel stressed the importance of both issues as he led a working session with his fellow mayors on increasing the minimum wage.\n\nLast month, Emanuel endorsed a plan to raise Chicago\u2019s minimum wage to $13 an hour from the current $8.25 by 2018. But the mayor also said the City Council would not take action until the state legislature considers increasing the statewide minimum wage after the November election.\n\nThe timing offers some wiggle room to Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn and U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, who are campaigning for re-election this fall on hiking the minimum wage to at least $10 an hour. Emanuel won\u2019t say whether he\u2019ll still pursue the $13 an hour rate in the city if state lawmakers go with $10.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to answer hypotheticals at this point,\u201d the mayor told the Tribune. \u201cIf the state acts, I\u2019ll bring the (city) task force back together and see what we want to do.\u201d\n\nEmanuel\u2019s embracing of the minimum wage issue got him a glowing introduction from de Blasio at a news conference Monday.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t come into office at an easy time in Chicago, but as is typical of Rahm, he turned things around with a focus and an energy that became irresistible, and he\u2019s making change happen,\u201d New York\u2019s mayor said. \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing with early childhood education, what he\u2019s doing to address wages is extraordinary and one of the inspirational parts of today\u2019s meeting.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio campaigned last year on a so-called millionaire\u2019s tax to pay for universal pre-K for all children and for New York City\u2019s right to have its own, higher minimum wage than the rest of the state. He won the funding for universal pre-K \u2014 though not from the tax he proposed \u2014 but so far has been rebuffed on raising wages.\n\nEmanuel\u2019s talk of offering universal pre-K and increasing the minimum wage has come more recently.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Emanuel said he planned to provide pre-K for 1,500 four year olds who live below or at the poverty level and don\u2019t have access to at least a half-day of learning. The proposal is not universal \u2014 it would not serve all of the city\u2019s four year olds \u2014 and Emanuel clarified Monday that he\u2019s calling it \u201cuniversal pre-K for all kids at poverty.\u201d\n\nThe mayor hasn\u2019t said how much such a program would cost or how he\u2019d pay for it, just that he\u2019d directed his staff to make that determination.\n\nWhile increasing the minimum wage and expanding early childhood learning are viewed as progressive issues, Emanuel\u2019s critics point to a record that reflects more of a pragmatist willing to cut the necessary deals to move legislation forward.\n\nAs a senior adviser to President Clinton in the 1990s, Emanuel was a leading architect of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a pact the nation\u2019s labor unions still despise. Emanuel was instrumental in passing an assault weapons ban, but also urged Clinton to take an aggressive approach on deporting illegal immigrants and later drew the ire of Latino congressmen by calling immigration reform \u201cthe third rail of American politics.\u201d\n\nAs President Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff, Emanuel lobbied for a less ambitious version of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at his career, I believe it shows that the mayor really doesn\u2019t have any political philosophy,\u201d said 2nd Ward Ald. Robert Fioretti, who also is contemplating a run against Emanuel. \u201cHe will do what\u2019s right for him and his election in any point in time instead of leading the people of this city.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Emanuel argued he\u2019s not altering his political philosophy or pandering to a certain portion of the electorate. The mayor insisted his work on the minimum wage is \u201cconsistent with everything I\u2019ve done my whole life in public life as a congressman and as a presidential aide.\u201d\n\nEmanuel highlighted his push for full-day kindergarten as evidence his passion for early childhood education isn\u2019t just tied to the election season.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Emanuel touts progressive issues in NYC ahead of re-election bid", "date": "2014-08-11", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "NEW YORK \u2014 Seated under the crystal chandeliers in the ornate ballroom of New York\u2019s official residence Monday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel related the story of a poor, single mother from Pilsen who chose to put off getting a job after discovering she couldn\u2019t afford several hours of child care after kindergarten let out for the day.", "title": "Emanuel touts progressive issues in NYC ahead of re-election bid", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/politics/chi-emanuel-heads-to-nyc-to-talk-minimum-wage-prek-education-20140810-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53f4b380/turbine/chi-emanuel-heads-to-nyc-to-talk-minimum-wage-prek-education-20140810", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp03.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/81049311", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "keywords": "Rahm Emanuel New York City NYC", "news_keywords": "Rahm Emanuel New York City NYC", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Mayor Rahm Emanuel heads to NYC to talk minimum wage, pre-K education"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3efb\"", "article_summary": "Emanuel\u2019s talk of offering universal pre-K and increasing the minimum wage has come more recently.\nLast month, Emanuel endorsed a plan to raise Chicago\u2019s minimum wage to $13 an hour from the current $8.25 by 2018.\nWhy did it take you three and a half years to discover a minimum wage?\nPat Quinn and U.S. Sen.
