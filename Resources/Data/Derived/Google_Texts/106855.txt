Yelp will begin showing readmissions data on hospitals' listings.

Add Yelp to the list of services rating hosptials online. The business listing site has teamed up with ProPublica to integrate data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services onto the business pages of more than 25,000 healthcare facilities in the United States.

Yelp listings will now include info on wait times, readmissions and infection numbers at hospitals, nursing centers and dialysis centers.

"Hover text on the business page will explain the statistics, which include number of serious deficiencies and fines per nursing home and emergency room wait times for hospitals," Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman said in a blog post announcing the partnership on Wednesday.

Yelp is already the top destination for consumers looking for physician reviews, with 27 percent of consumers consulting the site for doctor reviews, according to data from Software Advice â€“ even slightly above Healthgrades and RateMDs.
