Is MSNBC’s generally unflinching support of Obamacare experiencing a shift? The cable network that has trumpeted the Affordable Care Act since it was first proposed used the “Q-word” Wednesday to describe its failed rollout: “quagmire.”

Just a day after former President Bill Clinton urged the White House to honor its “you can keep it” health plan promise, and as more congressional Democrats have added their voices to support action to allow people to keep their existing insurance, MSNBC’s Donnie Deutsch called President Barack Obama’s signature piece of legislation a “quagmire.”

Appearing on “Morning Joe,” show co-host Joe Scarborough asked Deutsch, a Madison Avenue advertising legend, what would happen if General Motors had experienced such a disaster in launching a new car. That’s when Deutsch delivered the devastating verdict: “I think he’s in a quagmire either way, to tell you the truth.”

Addressing Scarborough’s suggestion that Obama should tell the American people that the launch was a disaster, and the website would be shut down and relaunched in six months, Deutsch made an even more damning declaration, “I think that the perception, right now, is so damaged that I don’t know if he — I don’t know if this legislation ever fully comes back from this.”
