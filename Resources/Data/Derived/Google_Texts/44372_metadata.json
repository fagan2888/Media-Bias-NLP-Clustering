Donna Lusczynski told local television stations that shots were fired in the direction of three arriving deputies around 12:30 a.m.\n\nDeputy Scott Ranney was hit in the left thigh and was taken to Tampa General Hospital. He was released about 7 a.m. and will recover at home, the Sheriff's Office said in a statement.\n\nThe deputies returned fire, but it wasn't known if they hit the suspect who they spotted outside a duplex.\n\nA perimeter was quickly set up in the Thonotosassa neighborhood and K-9 units and helicopters were searching for the man suspected of shooting at the deputies. Investigators asked residents to report any suspicious activity. They said roads would remain blocked off in the neighborhood until daylight so they could process the crime scene.\n\nOfficials say Ranney has been with the sheriff's office since 2009. He started as a detention deputy and became a patrol deputy last year.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "Consumer", "description": "A manhunt was underway in Thonotosassa after a sheriff's deputy was shot in the thigh early Thursday while responding to a 911 call about shots being", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/hillsborough-deputy-shot-suspect-sought", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201508/thono_shooting.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A manhunt was underway in Thonotosassa after a sheriff's deputy was shot in the thigh early Thursday while responding to a 911 call about shots being", "title": "Hillsborough Deputy Shot, Suspect Sought"}, "story_id": 432054246, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Associated Press", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Hillsborough Deputy Shot, Suspect Sought"}, "nid": 11616, "datePublished": "2015-08-13", "keywords": "police shooting, Hillsborough County Sheriff\\'s Office", "wordCount": 217, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccd0e\"", "article_summary": "He was released about 7 a.m. and will recover at home, the Sheriff's Office said in a statement.\nA manhunt was underway in Thonotosassa after a sheriff's deputy was shot in the thigh early Thursday while responding to a 911 call about shots being fired in the neighborhood.\nHe started as a detention deputy and became a patrol deputy last year.\nThe deputies returned fire, but it wasn't known if they hit the suspect who they spotted outside a duplex.\nOfficials say Ranney has been with the sheriff's office since 2009."}
