It is a place where ignorance is a virtue, and a reporter who asks tough questions must be menstruating, and every other critic is a \u201cdummy\u201d or a \u201closer\u201d or \u201cdopey\u201d or a \u201clow life\u201d or a \u201cfool\u201d or a \u201cfat pig\u201d or a \u201cdog\u201d or a \u201cslob\u201d or \u201ctruly weird\u201d or a \u201cbad guy\u201d or a \u201cdisgusting animal.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s America is not our America, and we trust it is not yours. Trump\u2019s America would be anything but \u201cgreat again.\u201d God forbid the Great Vulgarian should ever make it to the White House.\n\nEDITORIAL\n\nFollow @csteditorials\n\nIn the Illinois Republican primary on March 15, a responsible vote would be for anybody but Trump. But better than that, we urge a vote for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, knowing perfectly well that his odds of winning the nomination are remote. At least you\u2019ll be voting for the biggest grownup in the room.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida lacks experience and judgment, as evidenced in the way he has stooped to Trump-like schoolyard taunts. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas went to Princeton but can\u2019t spell the word compromise, which is why he\u2019s all talk and no action in Washington.\n\nKasich, in impressive contrast, has refused to jump into the mud pit. When invited at Thursday\u2019s raucous debate in Detroit to say something critical about one of Trump\u2019s odder foreign policy positions, Kasich said, \u201cI won\u2019t bite\u201d and offered a thoughtful explanation of his own positions.\n\nKasich has deep experience in public life and the private sector, both as a legislator and executive. Before being elected governor of Ohio in 2010, he served 18 years in Congress, where he was a member of the important House Armed Services Committee. He has been an investment banker, working as managing director of Lehman Brothers\u2019 Columbus, Ohio, office.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a little more honesty and common sense on the issues, Kasich stands out as well. He does not deny the reality of climate change, which sadly makes him an outlier in his own party, though he opposes the EPA regulating carbon emissions. He favors the completion of a fence along the Mexican border, but he would offer a path to legal status \u2014 not citizenship \u2014 for undocumented workers.\n\nAs a governor, Kasich has pushed for less prison time and more rehabilitation services for nonviolent offenders. He signed a bill in 2012 making it easier for ex-felons to get work, and he has argued that America\u2019s prisons are holding too many people who are mentally ill.\n\nKasich would of course abolish the Affordable Care Act \u2014 that\u2019s party orthodoxy \u2014 but he would retain the federal Medicaid expansion. Like Gov. Bruce Rauner here in Illinois, Kasich tried in Ohio to limit the collective-bargaining rights for public employees. But when that idea was rejected in a state referendum, he pretty much dropped it.\n\nIf we were to follow Mitt Romney\u2019s advice in this election, we would endorse Rubio or Cruz rather than Kasich in the Illinois primary. Romney, in a scathing takedown of Trump on Thursday, urged voters in each state to choose the candidate who appears to be strongest against Trump. In Illinois, a RealClearPolitics averaging of recent polls shows, Trump is favored by more than 30 percent of likely Republican voters, while Rubio is at about 17 percent and Cruz is at 15. Kasich is struggling at 11 percent.\n\nOur own view, though, is that the caliber of that alternative to Trump must be seriously considered as well. Kasich simply laps the field when it comes to experience, an understanding of the issues and temperament. Polls show that he also matches up best against Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, beating Clinton by more than 7 points.\n\nIf Trump fails to win his party\u2019s nomination outright and a messy battle ensues on the floor of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Kasich\u2019s star may rise yet.\n\nIn any event, a vote for Kasich is a vote against Trump, whose star can\u2019t fall fast enough for us.\n\nFollow the Editorial Board on Twitter: @csteditorials\n\nTweets by @CSTeditorials", "article_metadata": {"description": "<a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/csteditorials\">Follow @csteditorials</a>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/endorsement-kasich-grownup-not-trump/", "image": "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/549680298_59798675.jpg?w=400&h=400&crop=1", "site": "@suntimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sun-Times Endorsement: Kasich, a grown-up, instead of Trump"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282828", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "Chicago News, Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Weather and More", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://chicago.suntimes.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/endorsement-kasich-grownup-not-trump/", "type": "article", "image": "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/549680298_59798675.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "site_name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "title": "Sun-Times Endorsement: Kasich, a grown-up, instead of Trump"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Sun-Times Endorsement: Kasich, a grown-up, instead of TrumpFollow @csteditorialsDonald Trump\u2019s America is a place that goes soft on David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan.\nIn any event, a vote for Kasich is a vote against Trump, whose star can\u2019t fall fast enough for us.\nTrump\u2019s America would be anything but \u201cgreat again.\u201d God forbid the Great Vulgarian should ever make it to the White House.\nEDITORIALFollow @csteditorialsIn the Illinois Republican primary on March 15, a responsible vote would be for anybody but Trump.\nBruce Rauner here in Illinois, Kasich tried in Ohio to limit the collective-bargaining rights for public employees."}
