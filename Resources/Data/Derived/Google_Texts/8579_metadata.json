She followed this up in an interview for a Glamour cover story by saying, \u201cI\u2019m proud of what I said. I think it\u2019s good to see somebody saying: I have a belly. And I have cellulite. And I still deserve love. And to catch the old D.\u201d\n\nSchumer was widely praised for advancing the conversation around size and body acceptance, as she should be. But what if you\u2019re more than 160 pounds\u2014like 500 pounds more? Do you still deserve love, whatever your size?\n\nThat\u2019s the question I was thinking about when I came across headlines about Eric Hites, who launched the blog Fat Guy Across America to chronicle what he hopes to be a life-changing bicycle journey. His plan is to bike from the East Coast to the West Coast with the dual missions \u201cto prove things to my wife and my love\u201d and \u201cto take back my health and to lose the pounds I have collected over the years.\u201d For his pro-active approach, I applaud him.\n\nBut his story is a lot more complicated than his weight, or most of the news stories about him, would lead you to believe. An NBC News story was titled \u201c600-Pound Man Bikes Coast-to-Coast to Save Marriage, Lose Weight.\u201d People went with, \u201c\u2019Fat Guy\u2019 Plans to Bike More Than 3,000 Miles to Get His Wife Back.\u201d The New York Daily News wrote of Hites, \u201cAs his weight ballooned, his marriage was crumbling to pieces,\u201d and quotes him saying, \u201cI was just failing as a human being,\u201d without any context about how, exactly, he was failing. The implication is that his weight is enough to let us know he was a failure\u2014but the real story behind the issues in his marriage prove he had deeper issues. As he put it in a recent blog post (one that, I should note, was posted after the first flurry of media reports, in response to reader criticism of his wife), \u201cI was not left because I was fat, it was because I was a jerk and lazy.\u201d\n\nHites detailed some of his failings in that same post:\n\nMy wife and I separated last July for many reasons, money, issues at home etc. both of us were pains in the rear. I was a slob, borderline hoarder that was so over weight and unhealthy, I could not hold or get a job. I tried but, It would just not happen. So instead of working to get healthy, I tried to start businesses at the cost of my parents and eventually my father n law. I got sicker, grew depressed, kept secrets about money and kept things from her. I tried, but not as hard as I should. I should have tried to get healthy but I didn\u2019t, I sat there and did nothing.\n\nYet it\u2019s far easier to assume that his weight was the culprit, and that, by extension, once he loses weight, he will be worthy of love. According to activist Virgie Tovar, creator of the Lose Hate Not Weight hashtag and editor of \u201cHot & Heavy: Fierce Fat Girls on Life, Love & Fashion,\u201d equating thinness with worth isn\u2019t new. \u201cThe news coverage of Eric\u2019s bike ride is in conversation with this bigger American redemption motif, which is grounded in some of the same belief systems upon which diet culture pivots,\u201d Tovar told Salon. \u201cThe idea is that fatness is indicative of personal immorality, and that fat people need to redeem ourselves through weight loss. Discussions of marriage and discussions of weight loss share some of the same lexicon, such as \u2018being good\u2019 and \u2018cheating\u2019 (on a spouse or a diet). Cultural expectations around marriage and body size go back to the Protestant obsession with discipline, merit and morality. I think there is a strong cultural belief that an immoral person\u2014in this case, a fat person\u2014does not deserve to have access to love or the sanctity of marriage because those are things we \u2018earn\u2019 though discipline, merit and morality.\u201d\n\nWhile Hites is certainly media savvy enough to have crafted a plan both to capture his wife\u2019s attention and the world\u2019s, the way his story is being covered only emphasizes the dangerous idea that losing weight will make you happy, healthy and solve your problems. It\u2019s a seductive narrative, of course, because who doesn\u2019t want a happy ending? We love to see a hero go out on a quest like this; it speaks to pulling yourself up by the bootstraps\u2014or in this case, bike pedals, and makes it sound like we should be nodding our heads and saying, essentially, of course a 560-pound man would have trouble keeping his marriage alive. But the subtext of stories that imply weight loss will \u201csave\u201d his marriage to both the Hites and the topic a disservice.\n\nAccording to body acceptance coach Lauren Marie Fleming, these headlines aren\u2019t actually supportive of Hites as a whole person. \u201c\u2019600 pound man bikes across country to save marriage\u2019 puts his weight first, makes him a number, and dehumanizes him and his experiences,\u201d said Fleming. \u201cI\u2019d love to see a headline that left out his weight and instead focused on his emotional, physical, and spiritual journey instead, something like \u2018Man Rides Across Country to Overcome Obstacles in Love and Life.\u2019 Now that\u2019s something I\u2019d read and share.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A story about a man on an extreme fitness journey reveals much about our screwed-up morality around weight", "title": "\u201cFat Guy\u201d biking across America: Why we believe only thin people deserve to be loved", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A story about a man on an extreme fitness journey reveals much about our screwed-up morality around weight", "title": "\u201cFat Guy\u201d biking across America: Why we believe only thin people deserve to be loved", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/08/03/fat_guy_biking_across_america_why_we_believe_only_thin_people_deserve_to_be_loved/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/08/eric_hites.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A story about a man on an extreme fitness journey reveals much about our screwed-up morality around weight", "title": "\u201cFat Guy\u201d biking across America: Why we believe only thin people deserve to be loved", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/08/eric_hites.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Rachel Kramer Bussel", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Amy Schumer, health at any size, Love, Sex, Sports, weight", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe126d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe idea is that fatness is indicative of personal immorality, and that fat people need to redeem ourselves through weight loss.\nBut the subtext of stories that imply weight loss will \u201csave\u201d his marriage to both the Hites and the topic a disservice.\nShe followed this up in an interview for a Glamour cover story by saying, \u201cI\u2019m proud of what I said.\nThat\u2019s the question I was thinking about when I came across headlines about Eric Hites, who launched the blog Fat Guy Across America to chronicle what he hopes to be a life-changing bicycle journey.\nAccording to body acceptance coach Lauren Marie Fleming, these headlines aren\u2019t actually supportive of Hites as a whole person."}
