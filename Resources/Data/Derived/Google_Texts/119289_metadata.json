Bob Casey, D-Pa., but it remained unclear whether Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey would agree to a sit-down with Judge Garland. Toomey wants the winner of November\u2019s presidential election to pick the next justice.\n\nMr. Casey met with the judge for 40 minutes today in his Washington office.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t necessarily make a judgment about someone\u2019s demeanor or who they are as a person until you meet them,\u201d said Mr. Casey, who left the meeting feeling confident that Judge Garland would serve the court well.\n\n\u201cYou want someone who has the kind of academic credentials that Judge Garland has, and you want broad-based experience. I think he has all that and he also has significant life experience as a father and a citizen who has lived a full life,\u201d Mr. Casey said.\n\nThe Chicago native is a Harvard Law School graduate and a former prosecutor who worked on the Oklahoma City bombing case. President Barack Obama nominated him a week ago to fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans say that as a lame duck president, Mr. Obama has no business choosing a Supreme Court nominee in the final months of his term.\n\nSome, including Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, have refused even to meet with Judge Garland or any other Obama nominee.\n\nMr. Toomey hasn\u2019t said whether he will or will not meet with Judge Garland, only that voters should get to weigh in when they elect a new president in November. He said last week that he would \u201cbe happy to carefully consider\u201d Garland if he were nominated by the next president.\n\nMeanwhile, the judge has already met with Sen. Chuck Schumer, R-N.Y.; Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and Patrick Leahy, the leading Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. He has plans to meet today with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and has an appointment with Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, when the Senate returns from its spring break.\n\nThe Center for American Progress has been holding rallies across the country in front of state offices of senators they believe are blocking judicial nominations.\n\nOne of those rallies is planned for 11 a.m. today in front of Mr. Toomey\u2019s Pittsburgh office at Station Square. Mr. Toomey is up for re-eelection in November.\n\nThe rally coincides with arguments in a major U.S. Supreme Court challenge to part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMr. Toomey has said it\u2019s \u201cnot that big a deal\u201d to have a vacant seat on the court, but Mr. Casey disagrees.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to have a four-four court. You don\u2019t want to have that uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Constitution doesn\u2019t say \u2018the Supreme Court shall be made up of nine members if the Republicans feel like it,\u2019 or that \u2018the Senate shall advise and consent if it\u2019s convenient,\u2019\u201d Mr. Casey said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nine-member court. It should have nine members.\u201d\n\nLegal scholar Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond said the vacancy could be problematic for cases including the one being argued this morning. Petitioners including David A. Zubik, bishop of Pittsburgh, are seeking relief from a an accommodation in the Affordable Care Act that they believe violates their religious freedom.\n\nAt issue is a provision involving coverage for birth control for students and employees of religious non-profits such as schools and hospitals. Employers with religious objections to contraception can opt out if they notify their insurer or the government, which would then provide contraceptives directly. Bishop Zubik and others argue that the notification itself violates their religious freedom because it essentially requires them to sign off so their employees and students can get birth control.\n\nIt\u2019s a controversial case with strong advocates on both sides, and a four-four decision wouldn\u2019t help any of them, Mr. Tobias said. Rather than create a precedent, it would allow lower court rulings to stand, and that can lead to a patchwork of different laws around the country, Mr. Tobias said.\n\n\u201cYou like to have as much uniformity nationally as you can, and you like to have some final resolution. Otherwise you\u2019re wasting judicial resources and the resources of the [petitioners] who want their decisions final,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world but it\u2019s serious to the litigants and it may affect a lot of people.\u201d\n\nWashington Bureau Chief Tracie Mauriello: tmauriello@post-gazette.com; 703-996-9292 or on Twitter @pgPoliTweets.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Merrick Garland would do well on the Supreme Court, Sen.
