The best estimates suggest that 12 to 15 million people currently buy coverage on their own\u2014i.e, in what's known as the non-group market. It appears that only a fraction of them will get to keep their current policies. The rest will end up having to get new coverage, or updated versions of their old coverage, that offers greater benefits and/or is available to everybody, regardless of pre-existing condition. That will drive up the price of insurance.\n\nBut when you take into account the subsidies, which for many people will knock the price of insurance right back down, and the number of people who would gladly pay more for insurance that offers real protection from financial shock, the number of people who truly end up feeling worse off ends up a lot smaller than 12 or 15 million. And even those people will end up with good health insurance, though they\u2019ll be paying more for it and may not want it.\n\nMeanwhile, the best available projections suggest that 13 million people will eventually sign up for Medicaid. That\u2019s a much larger number of people, most of whom had no insurance\u2014none\u2014before. That doesn\u2019t even include more than ten million presently uninsured people expected to get insurance through employers and the new marketplaces, assuming all of the websites start working better, or the millions of seniors getting extra help with their prescrpition drugs.\n\nOf course, the story of the Medicaid expansion is also one of suffering. But that\u2019s because Republicans governors and lawmakers are blocking expansion of Medicaid in their states. About 5 million people who would be eligible for Medicaid under Obamacare's new guidelines won't be getting it. Here\u2019s a mental exercise. How many stories have cable news and the networks run about people with private insurance getting cancellation notices? And how many have they run about people who would be getting Medicaid if only their state lawmakers would stop blocking expansion?\n\nYou can find examples, usually from domestic policy writers in print. My colleague Alec MacGillis has waged a lonely crusade to remind people about this situation. The New York Times had a terrific front-page story on this in early October, and Politico's Jen Haberkorn wrote about it a few weeks later. In the Washington Post, Ruth Marcus on Friday wrote about Paul Tumulty, in Texas, who can't get insurance because Governor Rick Perry has blocked that state's Medicaid expansion. Tumulty, who is the brother of Post staff writer Karen, has kidney disease. Wiithout Medicaid he can't get comprehensive coverage, because, as Karen put it, \"he is, paradoxically, too poor for subsidies.\"\n\nBut these articles are the exception more than the rule. Obama tried to draw attention to the issue last week, when he visited Texas. But the trip didn't generate much in the way of new coverage of Medicaid.\n\nShould the president have been more candid about the impact his plan would have on people buying their own coverage? Yes. Should we pay attention to those people, particularly when they must now pay more for equivalent coverage? Definitely. Should this put extra pressure on the administration and some states to fix their websites? You bet. But that's not the only Obamacare news right now. The law is making life better for a great many people\u2014and would help even more if only Republican lawmakers would relent.
