For our list of 106 Jerseyans with the most juice, we went to the experts — The Star-Ledger reporters and Inside Jersey writers who cover and best know the state's movers and power brokers.

We have divided the list into an array of categories that touch on all facets of Jersey life — from politics to literature to technology and celebrity — profiling the most influential Jerseyans in each area. The lists will be released all week. It's a select group that we call the 100+ Club.

The schedule is as follows: On Monday, State Politics/Local Politics and Labor/Activism; On Tuesday, Law/Philanthropy and Business/Real Estate; On Wednesday, Technology/Health Care and Literature/Power Couples; On Thursday, Sports/Education and Arts/ Science; On Friday, Entertainment/Music and Food/Celebrity.

Read them each day and don't forget to take our informal polls at the end of each post.
