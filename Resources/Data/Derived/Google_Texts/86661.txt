Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on Friday became the first 2016 presidential candidates to sign the “Taxpayer Protection Pledge.”

Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative organization, has been asking candidates since 1986 to simply pledge to “oppose and veto any and all efforts to increase taxes.”

“By signing the Taxpayer Protection Pledge to the American people, Senator Paul continues to protect American taxpayers against higher taxes,” said Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform.

“Senator Cruz understands that government should be reformed so that it takes and spends less of the taxpayers’ money, and will oppose tax increases that paper over and continue the failures of the past,” Norquist also said.

All Republican presidential candidates, except for Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, signed the pledge in 2012.

A spokeswoman for Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has spoken out against signing pledges of any kind, has suggested the Republican will not add his name to ATR’s pledge if he runs.

“If Governor Bush decides to move forward, he will not sign any pledges circulated by lobbying groups,” Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told Reuters in February. “His record on tax cuts is clear. He didn’t raise taxes.”
