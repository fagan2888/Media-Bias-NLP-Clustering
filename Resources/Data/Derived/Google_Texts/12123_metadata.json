Maher followed that up by hypocritically describing Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson as a \u201cplain murderer\u201d for shooting Michael Brown dead.\n\nAs of now, the grand jury is still in session and nowhere near all the facts are known or have been released. Like the rest of us, Maher has no idea if Wilson is a murderer or was in fear of his life.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nEarlier this week, the Washington Post reported that up to 8 black witnesses back Wilson\u2019s side of the story but have remained silent fearing retaliation from Brown supporters, some of whom have shown a disturbing propensity for violence during various street protests.\n\nMaher then went on to attack supporters of Michael Brown for describing the teenager as a gentle giant. \u201cHe was committing a robbery and pushed that guy,\u201d Maher explained. \u201cHe was acting like a thug, not a gentle giant.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\n\u2014\n\nYou know what else I find disturbing is that everybody in America just sides with their own people and doesn\u2019t look at the facts. The cops I saw on the news a couple of weeks ago, were wearing bracelets or something that said, \u201cI am Darren Wilson.\u201d Why do you want to throw your lot in with this plain murderer?\n\nAnd Michael Brown\u2019s people\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but Michael Brown\u2019s people say he is a gentle giant. Well, we saw that video where he was in the 7-11. No, he wasn\u2019t a \u201cgentle giant.\u201d He was committing a robbery and pushed that guy. He was acting like a thug, not a gentle giant. He certainly didn\u2019t deserve to be shot for it.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Maher: Michael Brown a 'Thug,' Darren Wilson a 'Plain Murderer'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Bill Maher: Michael Brown a 'Thug,' Darren Wilson a 'Plain Murderer'", "title": "Bill Maher: Michael Brown a 'Thug,' Darren Wilson a 'Plain Murderer' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Ferguson/mike-brown-drawing-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2014/10/25/bill-maher-michael-brown-thug-darre-wilson-plain-murderer/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bill Maher: Michael Brown a 'Thug,' Darren Wilson a 'Plain Murderer'", "title": "Bill Maher: Michael Brown a 'Thug,' Darren Wilson a 'Plain Murderer' - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Ferguson/mike-brown-drawing-ap.jpg", "creator": "@noltenc", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bill Maher, Ferguson, Washington Post,Big Hollywood,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "tag": "Washington Post", "published_time": "2014-10-25T06:55:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Maher followed that up by hypocritically describing Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson as a \u201cplain murderer\u201d for shooting Michael Brown dead.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Friday\u2019s \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher,\u201d Maher chided those who have blindly taken sides in the Michael Brown shooting before knowing all the facts.\nMaher then went on to attack supporters of Michael Brown for describing the teenager as a gentle giant.\nAnd Michael Brown\u2019s people\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but Michael Brown\u2019s people say he is a gentle giant.\nNo, he wasn\u2019t a \u201cgentle giant.\u201d He was committing a robbery and pushed that guy."}
