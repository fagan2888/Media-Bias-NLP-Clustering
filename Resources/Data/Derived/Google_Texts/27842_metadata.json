Eddie Ableser, D-Tempe, author of SB 1023.\n\nAbleser has introduced a bill to reopen the museum every year since it had to shutter its doors in April 2011.\n\nIn 2010, Gov. Jan Brewer presented plans for an Arizona Centennial Museum, which would occupy the Mining and Mineral Museum\u2019s renovated space and showcase Arizona\u2019s Five C\u2019s: cattle, copper, cotton, citrus and climate.\n\nIt was with this intention that the Legislature transferred responsibility for the museum and the state\u2019s mineral collection from the Department of Mines and Minerals to the Arizona Historical Society.\n\nBrewer assigned the Arizona Centennial Commission to raise money for the new interactive museum by approaching businesses, with fundraising goals set between $9 million and $15 million.\n\nBut the commission never raised enough money to move beyond the planning phase. After Arizona\u2019s centennial came and went, the proposed museum\u2019s name changed to the Arizona Experience Museum.\n\nBrewer\u2019s press office didn\u2019t respond to calls and emails seeking comment on the bill. Karen Churchard, director of the Arizona Centennial Commission, was out of the office until Monday, Jan. 27, according a person who responded to a message left with the Arizona Office of Tourism.\n\nAbleser\u2019s bill, which had yet to be scheduled for a committee hearing, would transfer responsibility for the museum from the Arizona Historical Society to the Arizona Geological Survey, which absorbed the Department of Mines and Mineral Resources\u2019 duties in 2011.\n\nRay Grant, a retired geology professor at Mesa Community College and co-author of \u201cMineralogy of Arizona,\u201d said closing the museum prevented people from learning about a profession vital to Arizona\u2019s fabric as a state.\n\n\u201cTo me it\u2019s one of the greatest geologic states ever. Millions of people come to the Grand Canyon. What\u2019s it about? It\u2019s all geology, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he said.\n\nFormer Rep. Russ Jones, R-Yuma, who authored the 2010 legislation transferring responsibility for the museum and its collection, said low revenue and high rent made the old Mining and Mineral Museum unsustainable.\n\n\u201cThe museum portion was very, very popular. Unfortunately, the revenues from the activity as a museum were just a fraction of the cost of maintaining and paying the rents on that facility,\u201d he said.\n\nThe rent for the old building is still paid for by the state. According to a report by the Joint Legislative Budget Committee, the fiscal 2014 budget provides $428,000 to the Arizona Historical Society, $360,800 of it for rent on the unused museum space and $67,500 for a curator to care for the state\u2019s mineral specimens.\n\nSaying it\u2019s unfortunate that the commission couldn\u2019t raise enough funds for a centennial museum, Jones said Ableser\u2019s legislation would only cause more problems. The Arizona Geological Survey would require a huge sum of money and an increase in staffing to restore the museum, he added.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much we need to do that remains undone as we crawl out of the recession, I find it hard to justify millions of dollars for a mining museum when need to fund things for Child Protective Services, the list goes on and on,\u201d Jones said.\n\nAbleser\u2019s bill doesn\u2019t include any appropriation for bringing the museum back.\n\nThe collection from the former museum currently consists of more than 21,500 specimens and objects, according to the Arizona Historical Society\u2019s website.\n\nEven if Ableser\u2019s legislation doesn\u2019t succeed, people can see several of the state\u2019s minerals on display at the University of Arizona Mineral Museum, including a 225-pound azurite boulder from Bisbee.\n\nOther minerals will be part of a new Gallery of Natural History opening soon at the Arizona Historical Society\u2019s Museum at Papago Park, said Mark Candee, assistant curator and collection manager at the UA museum.\n\nBut Ableser still thinks the Mining and Mineral Museum should once again serve as home to the state\u2019s collection.\n\n\u201cMany of the volunteers that sacrificed their hours and time and resources have all the supplies still with them, ready to go, and we can reinstitute the mineral and mining museum today,\u201d he said.\n\n- 30 -", "article_metadata": {"DC.rights": "All rights reserved", "twitter": {"description": "For three years, most of the rocks, gems and artifacts once displayed by the Arizona Mining and Mineral Museum have remained unseen.
