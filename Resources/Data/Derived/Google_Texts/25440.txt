When bananas go bad, it’s not that big of a deal; you can always make banana bread. But, how do we manage the rest of our fruit and vegetable haul before it gets to be too late? First, check out our primer on expiration dates. Then, check out this handy infographic from Visual.ly.

Foods unopened, uncut, or uncooked (unless otherwise stated) can last up to months if stored properly, well-beyond their expiration date. Apples, for example, last up to four weeks when stored on the counter or in the pantry; they last up to two months in the refrigerator; and they last up to a whole year when stored in the freezer. Potatoes last up to a month on the counter, up to four months in the refrigerator, but the freezer isn’t recommended as a storage option at all.

Fresh vegetables generally tend to remain fresh longer in a moist environment — so if your refrigerator has a crisper, it may help to extend your haul’s shelf life. One thing to remember is not to store vegetables and fruits in the same crisper drawers, since fruits don’t require as much moisture to stay fresh.

What about leftovers? Visual.ly narrows down the most popular foods, like macaroni and cheese, pizza, sandwiches, and spaghetti, and they recommend only keeping them for a few days. Something like mac and cheese can last up to five days, while sandwiches last up to two days.
