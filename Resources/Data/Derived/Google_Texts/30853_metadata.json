Oregon\u2019s program, WND has learned, will serve as a global model. It is being closely watched by other states and by Congress as they search for an alternative to the sales taxes drivers pay on each gallon of gas. Germany and several other industrialized countries are also experimenting with the concept.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThink of it as a smart meter for your car. The more you drive, as tabulated by the GPS in your car, the more you pay. Oregon is charging 1.5 cents per mile as the introductory rate for drivers who opt into the voluntary program.\n\nVarious studies and pilot programs for the VMT tax, funded mostly by the Federal Highway Administration, have been done over the past 12 years but it was just too expensive to convert every car to a GPS format.\n\nThat has changed.\n\nMost newer cars now have built-in GPS systems that allow tracking through satellite systems and the older cars can be retrofitted with sensors that are relatively inexpensive and already in use on toll roads across the U.S.\n\nThe last hurdle is how to set the rates. A major federally funded study by the University of Iowa in 2011 called the \u201cNational Evaluation of a Mileage-based Road User Charge\u201d laid out the possibilities.\n\nJudging your \u2018carbon footprint\u2019?\n\nOn page 16 of that study, authored by public-policy professors Jon Kuhl and Paul Hanley, three alternatives are given.\n\nStates could make the per-mile fees neutral to the current gas tax, they could base them on the \u201cfuel efficiency\u201d of the car each motorist drives with \u201cgreen\u201d vehicles getting a cheaper rate than gas hogs, or they could tailor the rate to each driver\u2019s \u201coverall carbon footprint.\u201d\n\nThis sounds like something out of an Al Gore wet dream, says Patrick Wood, an economist, researcher and author of the new book, \u201cTechnocracy Rising: The Trojan Horse of Global Transformation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mileage rate would be customized just for you based on your carbon footprint throughout your lifestyle profile,\u201d said Wood, who also authors the blog August Forecast and Review. and co-authored the 1978 book \u201cTrilaterals Over Washington\u201d with Dr. Antony Sutton.\n\n\u201cThis could only be predicated on a massive database of carbon-related information about each citizen, especially from the smart grid,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that they call it a \u2018National Evaluation Study\u2019 clearly reveals that it is intended to be nationalized at some point, as enough states buy into it.\u201d\n\nRegardless of whether you buy into Gore\u2019s claims about \u201cglobal climate change,\u201d there is another issue \u2013 privacy.\n\nCritics see the system itself, no matter how the rates get set, as intrusive.\n\n\u201cIt goes beyond just collecting taxes because it also tracks your every movement,\u201d said Wood. \u201cWhere does all this information go after they collect it? It\u2019s not deleted, but is it shipped off to some central databank? It\u2019s about the data, it\u2019s about collection of data and storage of data. It\u2019s not about a tax.\u201d\n\nCongress and 29 states considering VMT\n\nThe VMT is being pitched as an alternative to fuel taxes and 29 states are in various stages of considering it. The 18.4-cent per gallon federal gas tax may also go by the wayside as Congress looks for a \u201cmore efficient\u201d and lucrative model of funding the nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure.\n\nMany in the \u201cgreen\u201d movement like the idea that people could be charged based on how much they drive rather than everyone paying the same flat-rate sales tax on the fuel the buy.\n\nRep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., said he was one of the first to sign up for Oregon\u2019s new road user-fee, called OReGO, and he hopes it takes off nationwide.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve introduced legislation in Congress that would fund projects like OReGO all across the country,\u201d Blumenauer told CNSNews.\n\nBlumenauer said the program will \u201cimprove the way we drive and the way we plan our communities as well as our trips.\u201d\n\nHe said it will help his state pay for a 21st century transportation system and \u201cwill lead the way for the nation to follow suit.\u201d\n\nListen to Oregon Democrat Earl Blumenauer pitch the \u201cpay-as-you-drive\u201d system:\n\nAnd for people worried about privacy issues, the OReGO website assures volunteers who enroll in the program will have their personal information \u201ckept secure and private.\u201d\n\nBut will OReGO\u2019s assurances be any more trustworthy than those provided by Sony Inc., Bank of America, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Obamacare and countless other companies and government agencies that have been hacked?\n\nIn fact, the Iowa study, on page 12, admitted that VMT systems \u201cwould be an attractive target for various types of cyber-attacks.\u201d\n\nAnother study on the VMT tax conducted by Georgia Tech in Atlanta suggested that states should offer a \u201crebate\u201d to drivers who drove fewer miles than the year before.\n\nIf this sounds like a line straight from the United Nations\u2019 sustainability agenda, that\u2019s because it is.\n\nImplementing the U.N. agenda: Get people out of cars\n\nThe U.N. has been prodding industrialized countries to make it more costly for drivers to drive for years with its sustainability and \u201csmart growth\u201d policies, said Tom DeWeese, founder of the American Policy Center. And every U.S. president since Bill Clinton has bought into the sustainability agenda.\n\n\u201cThis (VMT) is part of the sustainability program that has been kicking around the Obama Administration for years,\u201d DeWeese said. \u201cThey use the excuse that, with falling gas prices (and more fuel-efficient cars), states need a more stable way to collect funds for highway infrastructure. That way they can pretend to be concerned with sound and responsible fiscal policy.\u201d\n\nBut the real agenda behind the VMT has nothing to do with fiscal responsibility, DeWeese said.\n\n\u201cThe fact is, sustainability advocates call for less driving of cars,\u201d he said. \u201cSmart growth in the cities is all about getting people out of their cars and into \u2018walkable\u2019 communities and public transportation. That is where highway funds are disappearing into \u2013 expensive high-speed trains, trolleys and creating mandatory bike paths.\u201d\n\nThe Rand Corporation and the University of Iowa have been at the forefront of research into mileage-based \u201cpay as you drive\u201d schemes, according to the Federal Highway Administration, which has funded the bulk of the research.\n\nThe University of Iowa\u2019s \u201cNational Evaluation Study\u201d of the VMT concept concluded that the federal fuel tax \u201cno longer generates sufficient revenue to fund highway infrastructure needs.\u201d The study\u2019s authors lamented that the Federal Highway Trust Fund \u2013 funded by the 18.4-cent gas tax and 24.4-cent diesel tax \u2013 was running annual shortfalls due to Americans\u2019 buying less fuel.\n\nBut why is the Highway Trust Fund running shortfalls? Yes, Americans are driving less and the cars they buy can go further on a gallon of gas, but the Iowa study ignored the biggest drain on the trust fund. Since the late 1990s Congress has been siphoning billions of trust-fund dollars away from highways and into non-highway projects such as bike paths, walkways and mass transit systems.\n\nCOGs in the wheel\n\nA May 2015 study by the Heritage Foundation found that Congress has wasted 25 percent of the Highway Trust Fund money on non-highway projects. It has been especially fond of lavishing federal fuel-tax dollars on mass-transit systems. This federal transportation money gets passed through the states and often through unelected regional councils of government or \u201cCOGs,\u201d finding its way eventually to cities of all sizes. COGs plan future transportation projects for every metropolitan area in the U.S.\n\nThe COGs then implement the U.N. transportation agenda to a tee, said Wood.\n\n\u201cCOGs are notoriously unconstitutional and, in my opinion, generally illegal,\u201d he said. \u201cStill, they are everywhere and are implementing sustainable development in local communities. You will find all COGs as being in the dead center of any toll mechanism that spans multiple cities or counties.\u201d\n\nIf COGs are the implementers, Congress is the enabler.\n\nOf the 25 percent of Highway Trust Fund spending sent to non-highway projects, the largest of these diversions is the Mass Transit Account, which spent $8 billion in 2014 on buses, rail, streetcars, and other projects that should fall under the responsibility of municipal or state governments, the Heritage report stated.\n\nOther programs include the Transportation Alternatives Program, which spent $820 million in 2014 on projects such as sidewalks, bike paths, scenic overlooks, vegetation management and recreational trails, the report said.\n\n\u201cThese diversions sap funds that could be spent on the highway system \u2013 the purpose of the Highway Trust Fund \u2013 and shortchange the motorists and shippers that pay directly into the system through fuel taxes,\u201d Heritage concluded.\n\nSo advocates of the new VMT such as Oregon\u2019s Rep. Blumenauer are correct when they say the current method of investing in infrastructure through the Highway Trust Fund is not working. What they fail to point out is that the system has been intentionally broken by Congress steering highway money away from highways and into other projects meant to get people out of their cars.\n\nFord makes astonishing admission\n\nEven Ford Motor Co., in a stunning admission, told the Detroit Free Press last week that it was planning for a future in which it would sell vastly fewer cars.\n\n\u201cFord is planning for success in a future with more congestion, fewer cars and fewer people driving them,\u201d Free Press reporter Alisa Priddle wrote in her opening paragraph.\n\nThat \u201ccongestion,\u201d as Priddle explained, will no longer be in the form of cars but a combination of cars, buses, street cars, bicycles and walkers all sharing the same space.\n\n\u201cInstead of fighting public transportation, bicycles and car-sharing services, Ford is looking to join them. And still make money even if fewer people are buying cars,\u201d Priddle wrote.\n\nFord is trying to \u201creinvent itself as a mobility company\u201d and address the trend in urban areas of cities growing and becoming more congested, CEO Mark Fields told Priddle. \u201cPeople value access (to mobility) more than ownership. We need to understand customers\u2019 concerns and make their lives easier.\u201d\n\nThe final cog in the anti-car wheel could be the VMT tax, which will likely be packaged, at least initially, in such a way that it would appeal to conservatives and progressives, hitting them softer in the pocketbook than the traditional gas tax.\n\nBut once the fuel tax is completely phased out the new VMT tax could easily be \u201cadjusted\u201d with a rate structure that punishes the middle-class driver.\n\nAnother Orwellian system?\n\nBut the elephant in the room is the privacy issue. Blumenauer and the other politicians pushing the VMT have not offered any serious solutions to privacy concerns, preferring to paper over the issue with sweeping assurances that have no basis in reality.\n\nIn 2013 the American Enterprise Institute posted an article by Mark Perry, \u201cGas Tax on Mileage Shatters Right to Privacy.\u201d\n\nIn that article, Perry wrote:\n\n\u201cOne feature of the VMT tax is that it would require some way to measure travel, creating the possibility that the government will use advanced technology to track movements of every car and truck. \u201cUnder one scenario, automobile manufacturers would be required to install a GPS system \u2013 a \u2018black box\u2019 \u2013 in every vehicle to measure miles traveled. The government would then track your vehicle by satellite to follow each vehicle\u2019s total travel and calculate the tax.\u201d\n\nAre Americans ready for this?\n\nIn fact the government\u2019s own studies, such as the one by University of Iowa Public Policy Center, concluded that people might not be ready to give up their privacy rights and submit to a vehicle tracking system. A \u201clong phase-in\u201d period was recommend.\n\n\u201cPrivacy concerns: This is the \u2018hot-button\u2019 issue,\u201d the study concluded, listing the following hurdles that needed to be crossed at the time of the study in 2008-09.\n\n\u201cMany people fear that government will use the system to track them\n\nPublic understanding of technologies such as GPS is limited.\n\nThere is a fundamental tension between protecting privacy and providing auditability.\u201d\n\nPrivacy experts and small-government advocates are alarmed at the potential for misuse and abuse that such a system would present.\n\nWood, author of \u201cTechnocracy Rising,\u201d says the system fits right in with other privacy-stealing tracking systems that have become ubiquitous in recent years, such as the license-plate readers police use to scan every car tag passing by, in-home smart meters hooked into the smart grid, Obamacare\u2019s digitizing of medical records and Common Core\u2019s data mining of students\u2019 non-academic attitudes, values and beliefs. Not to mention the NSA\u2019s tracking of cellphone calls and emails.\n\nWood sees the VMT scheme as just one more element of the coming \u201ctechnocracy,\u201d which he describes in his book as a burgeoning \u201cscientific dictatorship\u201d by a self-appointed group of \u201cexperts.\u201d These experts or \u201ctechnocrats\u201d see themselves as anointed elites using big data to manage and control everyone\u2019s use of energy. And how much of an energy allotment each person gets will ultimately be dependent upon their value to society, Wood says. Of course it will be the technocrats who get to decide your value and thus the size of your \u201ccarbon footprint.\u201d\n\nBrzezinski, Rockefeller resurrect old movement\n\nThe technocracy movement started in the 1930s but after World War II it got mothballed when some of its original promoters at Columbia University fell into disrepute.\n\nBut the modern godfather of the movement, the man credited with resuscitating technocracy and bringing it back from the grave, is Zbigniew Brzezinski.\n\nWhile teaching at Columbia, Brzezinski wrote the book, \u201cBetween Two Ages: America\u2019s Role in the Technetronic Era,\u201d which was all about the need for an elite group of enlightened professionals to manage an increasingly chaotic world, using technology as their main tool of control.\n\nIn \u201cBetween Two Ages,\u201d Brzezinski wrote:\n\n\u201cThe technetronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by traditional values. Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen. These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities. \u201c\n\nIt was Brzezinski\u2019s book that caught the attention of global banker David Rockefeller, and the two men co-founded the Trilateral Commission in 1973. The TC would become the main vehicle of change working to implement the technocracy, according to Wood\u2019s research. Brzezinski and the other Trilateralists have been open about their desire to create a \u201cnew international economic order.\u201d\n\nViewed in a bubble, the VMT may be just one more disturbing change in the way society is ordered.\n\nBut viewed in the context of the rising technocratic dictatorship, Wood believes it should be sending off alarm bells, just as the implementation of the smart grid should have alarmed Americans but found most of them accept it with a yawn.\n\nCreating the new international order\n\nThe ultimate goal, as Wood sees it, is to replace the free enterprise system with a new centrally planned economic order based on energy credits and carbon footprints.\n\n\u201cThere is a group of people operating within our federal government who are hardcore technocrats in the same sense that in the 1940s and 50s we had hard-core communists, Alger Hiss and those types,\u201d he said.\n\nWood identifies some of the leading technocrats in the federal government under President Obama as John Podesto, the author of his climate-change policy and now the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign; Susan Rice, his national security adviser; Michael Froman, his chief trade negotiator; and Ashton Carter, his secretary of defense. All are members of the Trilateral Commission.\n\nThe technocracy movement sees societies evolving from one \u201corder\u201d to the next. The religious-based order is the lowest form of organized civilization as described in Brzezinski\u2019s book, \u201cBetween Two Ages.\u201d From there a civilization will evolve into a more nationalistic and capitalistic system, followed by Marxism and finally the highest form which is the technocracy.\n\nThe pope on board?\n\nPope Francis, in his recent encyclical on the environment, spoke repeatedly of \u201ctechnocracy\u201d and \u201cthe globalization of the technocratic paradigm.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did he learn such words?\u201d Wood asks. \u201cLikely it was from his chief science adviser, Hans Schellnhuber, an atheist and a pantheist who believes in Gaia, or \u2018Mother Earth\u2019 as a living, self-aware organism who is plenty upset with selfish, over-consuming humans who live on its surface.\u201d\n\nThe same ideology permeates the governments of the E.U. and the U.S., he said.\n\n\u201cWe have those in our government today that are dedicated to creating a system of technocracy that they will run,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIt is a replacement economic system and it has very specific requirements.\u201d\n\nWood said the 1932 novel \u201cBrave New World\u201d by Aldous Huxley was based on a vision of what the technocratic era would look like in the future.\n\n\u201cHe saw this was where things were heading back in 1932 and he drew his information from the technocracy movement,\u201d he said. \u201cOrwell was also influenced by technocracy (in \u20181984\u2019).\u201d\n\nBut the confirmation for Wood that his book, \u201cTechnocracy Rising\u201d hit a home run in its predictions of a new global economic system came just two months after the book went to print. The confirmation came from Christiana Fregares, head of the U.N. framework for climate change, during a Feb. 3 press conference.\n\n\u201cTwo months after I printed the book, in which I said they were trying to replace the capitalist model with a new economic model based on energy credits, the head of the U.N.\u2019s climate change program Christiana Fregares said \u2018this is the first time in the history of mankind that we are setting ourselves the task to intentionally change the economic development model that has reigned 150 years.\u2019\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s saying capitalism is going to be murdered, free enterprise is going to be murdered,\u201d Wood said. \u201cSo the question is what are they going to replace it with? It\u2019s the green economy, sustainability, it\u2019s just warmed-over technocracy from the 1930s.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Obamacare required Americans to turn over their health records to the government, Common Core forces them to turn over their children\u2019s education records and smart meters installed on their homes reveal real-time water and energy usage to government-regulated utilities.
