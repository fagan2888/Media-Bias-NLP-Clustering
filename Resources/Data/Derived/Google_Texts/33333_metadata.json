Presbyterian Medical Group is the part of Presbyterian Healthcare Services that runs medical clinics.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Rio Rancho is not necessarily unique to Rio Rancho,\u201d said Dr. David Arredondo, Presbyterian Medical Group executive medical director.\n\nFor a long time, he said, New Mexico and the nation have had a shortage of family practitioners and internal medicine doctors. When many more people abruptly became insured under the Affordable Care Act, there weren\u2019t enough doctors to go around.\n\nWhen patients need a new doctor, Arredondo said, Presbyterian tries to assign them to a clinic near their homes or of their choice. If the providers in those facilities can\u2019t handle new patients, they\u2019re sent to other area clinics.\n\nPresbyterian Medical Group Primary Care Director Dion Gallant said he\u2019s doing a lot of recruiting for primary care physicians.\n\n\u201cWe just need to get through the current stress on the system,\u201d he said.\n\nAs one generation of providers retires, the company has to hire the next generation. Recruiting can take a while, Gallant said, but he is finding physicians who want to work in Rio Rancho.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one provider at a time,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Presbyterian is offering other ways to access to health care.\n\nFor one, Arredondo said, the nonprofit is hiring \u201caccess providers\u201d who can address immediate needs with same-day appointments for people who can\u2019t get in to see their primary care physician soon enough.\n\nPresbyterian is also hiring more advanced-practice clinicians, such as certified nurse practitioners and behaviorists. These providers aren\u2019t doctors, but they can see and treat patients.\n\nVideo and phone visits are also available. Patients can talk with a doctor from wherever they have phone, mobile data or wireless Internet access, saving them from having to take time off work or find child care. Those visits are often free under Presbyterian insurance.\n\nUsing MyChart, a secure connection through the electronic medical records system, Arredondo said, patients can ask questions or request refills. The provider then reviews the request promptly and responds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable how much of our practice is shifting to MyChart, for patient convenience,\u201d Gallant said. There\u2019s also no co-pay for MyChart use.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Presbyterian Medical Group has a shortage of doctors in Rio Rancho, but officials are optimistic that situation will change.
