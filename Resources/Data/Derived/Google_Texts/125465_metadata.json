Because public systems continue to grow larger, hospital monopolies can negotiate better pay rates than private practices can attain. The pay equity difference, says Healey, is as large as 240 percent.\n\nIn Vermont, Medicaid pays doctors only 60 percent of the cost of providing services, while Medicare pays 80 percent. This means private practice doctors who serve large numbers of those patients stand to lose money because they have few options for making up the difference. The challenge of running a successful private practice in Vermont is reflected in the fact that about 20 percent of Vermont doctors are independent, compared to more than 50 percent in the rest of the nation.\n\nHealey came to Vermont in 1999, when he was hired as director of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at the University of Vermont Medical Center. Though UVM is luring other specialists into the public system, Healey says he will not go back.\n\n\u201cI would not be able to provide the style of care that I would like,\u201d said Healey. \u201c(Studies show) that when you compare public practice to private, responsiveness and appointment availability go down, while wait times and cost go up.\u201d\n\nHealey is not the only medical professional disenchanted with the state\u2019s health care system. Nurse practitioner William Goodwin of Danby says he left Community Health Centers of the Rutland Region to start his own practice.\n\n\u201cMy dream is the idyllic notion of the old country doctor,\u201d said Goodwin. \u201cThe public system is cold, clinical and impersonal. It makes patients nervous because they feel they have no power. It robs them of personhood.\u201d\n\nOperating from his home, Goodwin makes visits using the old house call model, driving to patients for appointments. He brings his clinic supplies with him for visits and, like public practices, outsources lab work.\n\nGoodwin believes personalized medicine is the key to cutting costs.\n\n\u201cBy getting to know my patient, I save them money,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I get a call from a patient saying they feel dizzy, I can recognize that symptom and connect it to what I know about them \u2014 that they are prone to anxiety and panic attacks. If they call a doctor who doesn\u2019t know them, they will unnecessarily send them to the ER for an EKG, costing thousands of dollars.\u201d\n\nGoodwin said he supports the Green Mountain Care Board\u2019s view that preventive medicine is a way to cut costs. He added that individualized preventive plans can save patients and the state money by solving problems before they happen.\n\n\u201cEven something as simple as flossing your teeth daily has been proven to decrease risk of heart disease by a large percentage,\u201d he said.\n\nHealey disagrees, and he even cited the GMCB\u2019s emphasis on preventive care as one reason he is leaving the state.\n\n\u201cPreventive care is bogus,\u201d said Healey. \u201cIt has a role, but a small one. It\u2019s not going to prevent appendicitis, or a gall stone or a broken leg. We already know preventive methods. But if I tell a patient to stop smoking, he tells me to shut up.\u201d\n\nBoth Healey and Goodwin agree that one of the most important policies for Vermont\u2019s health care future is to create an environment where private practices are allowed to thrive.\n\n\u201cThe cards are stacked so hard against us,\u201d Healey said. \u201cThe community is losing out. Competition is good. When a monopoly develops, responsiveness decreases.\u201d\n\nContact Emma Lamberton at elamberton@watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Recent career moves by two health care professionals reveal growing problems with Vermont's health care system.", "title": "Vermont health professionals opting out of state health care system - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/obamacare-doctor-questions.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-12T13:11:51+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/261960/vermont-health-care-professionals-dissatisfied/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "GMCB,Healthcare,Vermont", "published_time": "2016-04-12T11:25:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-12T13:11:51+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Recent career moves by two health care professionals reveal growing problems with Vermont's health care system.", "title": "Vermont health professionals opting out of state health care system - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/obamacare-doctor-questions.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Recent career moves by two health care professionals reveal growing problems with Vermont's health care system."}, "article_summary": "Vermont health professionals are struggling with the ethics and economics of the state\u2019s health care system \u2014 some are going private, and some are leaving the state, in order to provide quality care for patients.\nThough UVM is luring other specialists into the public system, Healey says he will not go back.\nHealey disagrees, and he even cited the GMCB\u2019s emphasis on preventive care as one reason he is leaving the state.\n\u201cThe public system is cold, clinical and impersonal.\nHealey came to Vermont in 1999, when he was hired as director of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at the University of Vermont Medical Center."}
