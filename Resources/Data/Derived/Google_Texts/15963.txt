NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) – The Midtown location of Noshville Delicatessen will permanently close its doors on Dec. 27.

In a statement, owner Tom Loventhal notes the property has been sold and they initially planned to keep operating through 2016.

However, Loventhal says the “rising cost of insurance premiums and government requirements related to the Affordable Care Act have made it no longer possible to run the business without taking an unacceptable risk.”

“The administrative time and costs of managing mandated health insurance in the restaurant industry create an untenable burden, and that’s before the cost of premiums,” Loventhal continued.

Both the Green Hills and Nashville airport locations will remain open.
