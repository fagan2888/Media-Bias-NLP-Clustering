True, all previous efforts to halt the violence in Syria and bring warring parties to the negotiating table have collapsed in ignominy\u2014sometimes in a day. As an odds game, the skeptics seem to bet wisely.\n\nRelated: Turkey Says Obama Shares Syria Concerns With Erdogan, Affirms Support\n\nThey\u2019re unwisely missing the essential point: Diplomatic circumstances and \u201cfacts on the ground\u201d have changed drastically in just a few weeks. Most of those needed to achieve a settlement now have a motivation to work toward one.\n\nThis truth arises from a single new reality.\n\nThe Obama administration has long asserted that there is no military solution in Syria\u2014only a political bargain. But Russia\u2019s air campaign in support of Syrian troops as they\u2019ve approached Aleppo and other key towns and cities has just proven the president and Secretary of State Kerry wrong.\n\nThere most certainly is a military solution available, and we can count on the Russians to impose it if the informal ceasefire that took effect Friday at midnight fails. It\u2019s hard to imagine that rebel militias, as well as their Saudi and Turkish backers, don\u2019t understand this.\n\nI follow the presidential campaign debates, especially between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, with this thought in mind. Clinton persists in calling for a U.S.-enforced no-fly zone sequestering northern Syria on its border with Turkey; Sanders wants to disengage as far as possible.\n\nRelated: Israel Pessimistic on Syria Ceasefire, Talks Up Sectarian Partition\n\nThey\u2019re both off. Since Russian warplanes are bound to continue bombing ISIS and al-Nusra targets, Clinton\u2019s proposal presents a reckless risk of widening warfare. Sanders forgets Colin Powell\u2019s adage after the 2003 invasion of Iraq: You break it, you own it. In Syria as in Iraq, the U.S. role in precipitating the crisis means it has to commit itself to a resolution if there\u2019s to be one.\n\nOne point of concern about the ceasefire deal is that it was struck between Moscow and Washington. Not everyone has signed on.\n\nI don\u2019t see this, either. When the Russians flew their first bombing sortie last September 30, Syria was instantly transformed into a field of great-power rivalry.\n\nTwo signatures on the accord are therefore enough, at least at this stage. Moscow and Washington can control\u2014directly or indirectly, easily or coercively\u2014all the combatants the pact covers and all their outside supporters.\n\nWhat\u2019s the view from Moscow and Washington, then, now that they\u2019ve reached a fragile agreement on Syria?\n\nFrom the Russian perspective, Syria has gone from a significant liability to an opportunity. The air campaign has plainly been effective. It\u2019s now beyond dispute that Moscow has an essential role in whatever version of a political settlement may come to be.\n\nRelated: Syria government, ISIS Commit Crimes Against Humanity\n\nNote how President Vladimir Putin made the deal public: He went on national television and, with an unmistakable suggestion of pride, announced that Russians and Americans had agreed to work together in Syria.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the subtext: This is Putin\u2019s best chance yet to prove Russia\u2019s status as a great power, as he has long desired. His success on the ground is half the loaf. Now he has to do whatever he can to make a ceasefire and political talks come good.\n\nMoscow now has to keep Damascus in line, and this ought not to prove difficult. President Bashar al-Assad has accepted the terms of the deal, even if he hasn\u2019t signed it, and he\u2019s likely to stay with it for one reason: It serves his interests.\n\n\u201cThe pause in fighting may have the unintended consequence of consolidating President Assad\u2019s hold on power over Syria for at least the next few years,\u201d David Sanger wrote in Saturday\u2019s New York Times. \u201cIt may also begin to freeze in place what already amounts to an informal partition of the country, even though the stated objective of the West is to keep the country whole.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Road to Aleppo: How The West Misread Putin Over Syria\n\nAs to the Obama administration, it\u2019s hard to say whether it overplayed its hand or underplayed it. Either way, let\u2019s leave it that Obama and Kerry didn\u2019t make lemonade out of this lemon.\n\nBy strategic ambiguity or ineptitude, the Obama administration bumbled along ineffectively in Syria for four years \u2014 even after the ISIS emerged as a force in 2014. Moscow\u2019s decisive entry into the conflict caught the White House utterly off guard, and in consequence, the bargaining table now offers the only one dignified exit strategy.\n\nWashington\u2019s big jobs are several.\n\nFirst, it must now tell us all\u2014especially the Russians\u2014just who is legitimate opposition and why. Russia\u2019s probably in no mood for another blurry American account of some Islamist militias as \u201cmoderate\u201d in supposed contrast to others.\n\nThe U.S. just sent Russia a list of 69 armed rebel groups that accept the ceasefire accord, Reuters reported Sunday, citing Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency. This has to make good, clear reading if it is to prove effective.\n\nSecond, Washington has to whip Turkey and Saudi Arabia back into their cages. The Turks assert they will continue to attack Syrian Kurds as terrorists\u2014ridiculous\u2014and the Saudis continue spoiling for war even since the ceasefire took effect.\n\nAt this moment the Syrian crisis comes to one remarkably symmetrical contradiction: For Russia, the war is an existential threat, given its role in breeding terrorists, with strategic considerations attaching; for the U.S., strategic rivalry still dominates the thinking on Syria, while there is little threat to national security.\n\nIf the new agreement halting hostilities is to lead anywhere, these upside-down interests will have to be reconciled.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "We have a serious \u201ccessation of hostilities\u201d in Syria, finally, and it\u2019s the best chan", "title": "How the US and Russia Can Make the Syria Ceasefire Deal Last", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/02/29/How-US-and-Russia-Can-Make-Syria-Ceasefire-Deal-Last", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/06302014_Putin_Obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/02/29/How-US-and-Russia-Can-Make-Syria-Ceasefire-Deal-Last", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/06302014_Putin_Obama.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@psmith7600"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "We have a serious \u201ccessation of hostilities\u201d in Syria, finally, and it\u2019s the best chan", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Related: Israel Pessimistic on Syria Ceasefire, Talks Up Sectarian PartitionThey\u2019re both off.\nOne point of concern about the ceasefire deal is that it was struck between Moscow and Washington.\nThe U.S. just sent Russia a list of 69 armed rebel groups that accept the ceasefire accord, Reuters reported Sunday, citing Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency.\nWhat\u2019s the view from Moscow and Washington, then, now that they\u2019ve reached a fragile agreement on Syria?\nWhen the Russians flew their first bombing sortie last September 30, Syria was instantly transformed into a field of great-power rivalry."}
