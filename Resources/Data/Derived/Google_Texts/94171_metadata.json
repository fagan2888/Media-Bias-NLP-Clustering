Massachusetts and Connecticut, for example, who have seen 68 percent drops.\n\n\u201cHistorically, South Dakota\u2019s rate has been lower than the national rate, so our declining rate might not seem as significant as some other states,\u201d Colleen Winter, director of Health and Medical Services in the state Department of Health, explained by email.\n\nAsked if there were other factors, Winter said it could be due to educational programming, but added \u201cthe data doesn\u2019t really tell us why the teen pregnancy rate is declining.\u201d\n\nDr. Laurie Landeen, who works in obstetrics for Sanford Health, said she knows the reasons. In a state where the unintended pregnancy rate is 46 percent for all age groups, the evolution of long-acting reproductive contraception has dramatically curbed the number of those unplanned pregnancies, she said.\n\nWhat happens now is that contraceptive devices implanted in the uterus or under the skin prevent conception for three to five years. Women don\u2019t have to worry about whether they took a pill or how long ago they had a contraceptive shot.\n\n\u201cThey are almost as effective as having sterilization, though they are reversible,\u201d Landeen said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the actual birth rate is decreasing among all populations, but specifically among teens.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the long-acting devices, South Dakota has also seen a dramatic decrease in its abortion rate, she said. Where there were 826 abortions in the state in 2002, the number had dropped to 597 in 2011 and 634 in 2012.\n\n\u201cTo me,\u201d Landeen said, \u201cthat\u2019s one of the biggest success stories.\u201d\n\nAs to why South Dakota hasn\u2019t enjoyed even more success on its teen birth rate numbers, Dr. DenYelle Kenyon, a scientist with Sanford Research, said it\u2019s likely tied to the state\u2019s rural nature.\n\nThe National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy noted that in 2010, the birth rate for teens ages 15 to 19 in rural counties \u2014 those with a population of 50,000 or less \u2014 was 43 per 1,000, almost one-third higher than the 33 per 1,000 in urban counties.\n\nIn South Dakota, 64 of 66 counties fall into the rural category.\n\nThat reality and the high birth rate among the state\u2019s tribal population both explain South Dakota\u2019s ranking at 48th to Kenyon.\n\n\u201cBecause we are a rural frontier state ... that\u2019s probably what is driving it,\u201d she said.\n\nWorking with a grant from the Centers of Excellence through the National Institutes of Health, Kenyon and Sanford Research have been developing a health and sex education curriculum called \u201cMy Journey\u201d that focuses on tribal youth but could be applied widely across the state.\n\nThe curriculum has been written, revised and tested in pilot programs. Kenyon said she is waiting for a grant from the Office of Adolescent Health to pay for rigorously testing it. She is convinced it can help lower the teen birth rate even further.\n\nBut to do so, both she and Landeen agree that a discussion on the use of long-term reproductive contraception needs to be part of that curriculum.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that we live in a very conservative state,\u201d Landeen said. \u201cWe are more conservative ... than many other states. And many people in South Dakota believe in abstinence-only education.\u201d\n\nThat said, research has shown comprehensive sex education that includes discussions of birth control has been shown to more effective than abstinence-only education, she and Kenyon say.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we know that it\u2019s both education and access to contraception\u201d that are driving the teen birth rate down, Kenyon said. \u201cWithout the education piece, the youth may not know about contraceptive methods. Or that it\u2019s even accessible in rural areas and clinics.\u201d\n\nIn her mind, one of the benefits of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act is the fact that Medicaid now pays for long-acting contraceptive devices, Landeen said. The coverage of what can be a $2,000 bill for the device and implantation has tremendous repercussions, she said, especially since a lot of teen mothers come out of poverty situations.\n\nAccording to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, South Dakota taxpayers spent $500 million between 1991 and 2010 to cover costs incurred by 23,209 teen births. It would have been even greater except for the decline in the birth rate during that same time frame, resulting in a $12 million savings alone in 2010, the organization said.\n\nFor those reasons alone, South Dakota should not become complacent now and be satisfied with a 39 percent annual decrease in the number of teens giving birth, Kenyon and Landeen said. The alternative to not staying vigilant is more unintended pregnancies, more high-risk births, more pre-term babies in intensive care \u2014 and a rising cost to taxpayers.\n\n\u201cWe have a ways to go,\u201d Landeen said. \u201cBut if you ask me, I think we\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nDeclining teen births\n\nThe number of teens giving birth in South Dakota has been steadily declining since 1991. Here\u2019s a look at the numbers between 2004 and 2013.\n\n2013: 822\n\n2012: 937\n\n2011: 974\n\n2010: 983\n\n2009: 1,102\n\n2008: 1,130\n\n2007: 1,198\n\n2006: 1,134\n\n2005: 1,103\n\n2004: 1,134\n\nSource: S.D.
