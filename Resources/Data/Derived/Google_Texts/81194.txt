Addressing HIV/AIDS among women and girls was a key focus area of many sessions at the 20th International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2014) in Melbourne, Australia. Presenters covered such important topics as HIV prevention interventions for women and girls, the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and enhancing HIV care and treatment for women and girls. To learn more about what has been discussed at the conference on this topic, we caught up with Dr. Gina Brown, Coordinator of Women and Girls and Microbicides Research at the NIH’s Office of AIDS Research.

Dr. Brown observed that at this conference she saw greater attention being paid to better understanding the social and behavioral issues that impact the effectiveness of HIV prevention, care, and treatment for women and girls. Along these lines, she observed that gender-based violence received significant attention at the conference, as HIV researchers and practitioners worldwide grow in their understanding of the interrelationship of various forms of violence between women and girls and their HIV risk.
