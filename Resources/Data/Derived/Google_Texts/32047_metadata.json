After her death, her family said that she had been constantly hounded by charities asking for donations\n\nAnd warnings about data sharing will no longer be \u2018hidden\u2019 in the smallprint of fundraising literature.\n\nThe Mail revealed last week that some charities were routinely trading in donors\u2019 data and even selling the information to firms operating scams.\n\nSamuel Rae, an 87-year-old with dementia, had his details passed on up to 200 times and lost \u00a335,000 to conmen. Major charities were also exposed for contacting households on official \u2018no call\u2019 lists.\n\nThe new rules will ban call centres from using withheld numbers so that victims of aggressive fundraising can complain.\n\nAll the measures are likely to be in force by the end of the month. But it is likely the code will apply only to new donors and will not work retrospectively. This means existing donors could still see their details shared and, in some cases, sold on.\n\nApologising last night, the charity bosses' revealed that measures were being taken, including the revision of the code of conduct small print\n\nThe Institute of Fundraising (IoF) admitted that the 'there have been times where fundraising practices has failed to live up to these high standards'\n\nPENSIONER HOUNDED BY FOUR BEGGING CALLS EVERY DAY By Vanessa Allen for The Daily Mail A pensioner has been sent 50 unsolicited \u2018gifts\u2019 by charities within two years after being targeted as a potential donor. Nigel Macmillan, a widower who lives alone, receives four letters and four phone calls a day on average asking for money. The 85-year-old has asked the charities to stop contacting him but is being bombarded with unwanted items through the post. Nigel Macmillan (pictured) receives four letters and four phone calls a day on average asking for money Among other things, he has received a child\u2019s doll, canvas shopping bags, greetings cards, pens and a set of crucifixes despite having never donated to most of the organisations involved. The retired engineer said he feels \u2018emotionally blackmailed\u2019 by the gifts. \u2018You feel they have sent you something so you should really donate,\u2019 said Mr Macmillan, from Glasgow. \u2018It feels as if I can\u2019t do anything to stop it.\u2019 The grandfather said that people who call \u2018can be very pushy\u2019 and sometimes ask to speak to his wife, who died six years ago. He has now cut back the amount he gives to just two charities, but is considering stopping these donations. Battersea Dogs Home, which sent Mr Macmillan a pen and keyring, said it \u2018is never our intention for donors to feel under undue pressure\u2019. Other charities which have targeted him could not be reached for comment.\n\nIn a letter to The Sunday Times yesterday, bosses of 17 big charities admitted their fundraising procedures had \u2018failed to live up to\u2019 their high standards.\n\nThey wrote: \u2018No one should ever feel pressured into giving. The vulnerable should always receive the strongest protection. And we need to act quickly and decisively when any fundraising practice is found wanting.\u2019\n\nBut Sir Stephen Bubb, the head of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, complained the new rules would mean \u2018less giving and less support for what the British public see as great causes\u2019.\n\nHe said it would mean there is less money to spend on \u2018cancer research, on helping vulnerable people and supporting refugees\u2019. He told Sky News: \u2018It\u2019s right that we react to public concern and make changes to try to restore people\u2019s trust in our fundraising techniques.\n\n\u2018But I would also make the point that it\u2019s a very simple equation that less asking means less giving.\n\n\u2018And I suspect that changes will mean there is less money coming to great causes, and charities will have less to spend on cancer research, on helping vulnerable people and supporting refugees as we have seen recently.\u2019\n\nHe added: \u2018I know from charity chief executives that they feel there has never been a time where they have faced greater demands on their services and yet resources have been so constrained.\u2019 His remarks will raise concerns that charities are only reluctantly abandoning fundraising practices that have prompted public outrage.\n\nSamuel Rae's details were passed on after he failed to tick a box on a lifestyle survey in 1994 saying his information should not be shared\n\nThe Daily Mail Investigations Unit revealed that former army colonel Samuel Rae's details were passed on hundreds of times and resulted in the 87-year-old losing 35,000 pounds to fraudsters who purchased the data\n\nMarilyn Baldwin OBE, founder of the anti-scams charity Think Jessica, said: \u2018To complain that measures to protect vulnerable donors would cause them to lose money just shows these charity bosses still don\u2019t get it. It is exactly the same kind of moral blackmail we get from their cold calls \u2013 and the public have had enough of it.\n\n\u2018If these charities were serious about protecting vulnerable people, they would simply stop trading in their supporters\u2019 data.\n\n\u2018By buying and selling donors\u2019 details, they are fuelling the rising tide of scams against the elderly and vulnerable. Being on these lists is destroying people\u2019s lives.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s also not clear how these measures are going to protect people from aggressive cold-calling techniques. They need to go much further.\u2019\n\nMinisters have already pledged to bring in laws requiring charities to be explicit about their fundraising techniques. And a Government-commissioned review led by Sir Stuart Etherington is expected to report next week.\n\nA watchdog could be set up within the Charity Commission with the power to impose fines on rule-breakers. It is hoped this will bring an end to the aggressive fundraising practices seen in boiler room-style call centres.\n\nTomorrow bosses of major charities will be grilled on fundraising practices by MPs on the Commons public administration committee.\n\nExecutives from Oxfam, the NSPCC, Save the Children and the RSPCA are expected to give evidence as well as officials from charity regulators.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "British,charities,set,ban,aggressive,fundraising,tactics,create,opt,public,outrage,targeting,vulnerable,people", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3224033/British-charities-set-ban-aggressive-fundraising-tactics-create-opt-public-outrage-targeting-vulnerable-people.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "A number of top British charities are set to introduce an 'opt in' system designed prevent them from using aggressive fundraising tactics and passing on people's details.", "title": "British charities set to ban aggressive fundraising tactics", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3224033/British-charities-set-ban-aggressive-fundraising-tactics-create-opt-public-outrage-targeting-vulnerable-people.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/09/06/15/2C05FFDB00000578-0-image-a-34_1441548229458.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3224033/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3224033/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 3224033, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "British,charities,set,ban,aggressive,fundraising,tactics,create,opt,public,outrage,targeting,vulnerable,people", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2015-09-06T14:06:35.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Jack+Doyle", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-09-07T07:06:03.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "British charities set ban aggressive fundraising tactics create opt public outrage targeting vulnerable people"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "A number of top British charities are set to introduce an 'opt in' system designed prevent them from using aggressive fundraising tactics and passing on people's details.", "title": "British charities set to ban aggressive fundraising tactics", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3224033/British-charities-set-ban-aggressive-fundraising-tactics-create-opt-public-outrage-targeting-vulnerable-people.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/09/06/15/2C05FFDB00000578-0-image-a-34_1441548229458.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/bc/rtmp_uds/1418450360/2015/07/06/1418450360_4340484974001_4340411216001.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "A number of top British charities are set to introduce an 'opt in' system designed prevent them from using aggressive fundraising tactics and passing on people's details."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbaeb\"", "article_summary": "Charities yesterday bowed to pressure to stop trading the personal data of donors in a victory for the Daily Mail.\n\u2018By buying and selling donors\u2019 details, they are fuelling the rising tide of scams against the elderly and vulnerable.\nThe 85-year-old has asked the charities to stop contacting him but is being bombarded with unwanted items through the post.\nThe Mail revealed last week that some charities were routinely trading in donors\u2019 data and even selling the information to firms operating scams.\nSamuel Rae, an 87-year-old with dementia, had his details passed on up to 200 times and lost \u00a335,000 to conmen."}
