If you're into mixed martial arts, wrestling or submission grappling you might enjoy the Art of Grappling tournament this Saturday, Oct. 12. It's taking place in Tampa at the Downtown Hilton and will feature some of the biggest names in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: Roberto Cyborg Abreu and Pablo Popovitch two of them.

The reason these guys are coming out? There's $10,000 at stake - winner takes all. The tournament starts at 11:45 a.m. and costs $15 for spectators. The finalists will grapple later on in the evening - around 8:30 p.m.

Cyborg is a 5-time BJJ world champion (competitions are put on by the IBJJF) and Popovitch is a four-time world champ.
