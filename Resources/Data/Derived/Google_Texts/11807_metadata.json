With the third round of open enrollment starting Sunday, there\u2019s another Obamacare tax that\u2019s due for a rethink: the penalty for not carrying insurance.\n\nThat penalty \u2013 the stick behind the individual mandate \u2013 makes sense in theory. The point of the law is to provide affordable health insurance for as many Americans as possible. It uses generous federal subsidies to entice those without job-based insurance to buy plans on the exchanges. And to provide a sharper nudge, the law also levies significant fines on those who don\u2019t get coverage.\n\nThe tax penalty also helps fund the law\u2019s other provisions. The Internal Revenue Service says it\u2019s brought in $1.5 billion so far, and the amount will increase as the penalty grows.\n\nThe problem is, the tax doesn\u2019t appear to be doing enough to change behavior. As many as three out of four uninsured Americans who qualify to buy coverage on Obamacare\u2019s state health exchanges will nonetheless choose not to next year, according to government projections. If these projections are correct, then the tax is becoming more akin to a penalty on people who don\u2019t understand the law or don\u2019t like the options it provides. It\u2019s failing at its main purpose.\n\nWhat options should be considered? One strategy would be to raise the subsidies for premiums and cost-sharing. Perhaps more health services should be made available before beneficiaries have to pay their deductibles, as Hillary Clinton has proposed.\n\nTighter caps on out-of-pocket payments would also help. Another approach would be to increase premiums the longer people are eligible for coverage but don\u2019t sign up.\n\nThe simplest way to reach this group would be to automatically enroll them. Those who really don\u2019t want coverage could still opt out. But this would raise hard questions about whether it\u2019s appropriate for the government to make purchasing decisions for citizens (even if those purchases are publicly funded).\n\nWith any alternative, the details would be difficult to work out. But Obamacare needs incentives and tools that really work to get more Americans insured.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Other approaches should be considered to get young people to enroll for coverage.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Other approaches should be considered to get young people to enroll for coverage.", "title": "Another View: Obamacare penalty for non-enrollees isn't spurring sign-ups - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/655597_412201_health_overhaul_quin.jpg", "height": 725}, "updated_time": "2015-10-31T22:00:51-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2015/11/01/another-view-theres-a-better-approach-than-the-individual-mandate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Other approaches should be considered to get young people to enroll for coverage.", "title": "Another View: Obamacare penalty for non-enrollees isn't spurring sign-ups - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/655597_412201_health_overhaul_quin.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Editorials", "published_time": "2015-11-01T03:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-31T22:00:51-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The tax penalty also helps fund the law\u2019s other provisions.\nBut Obamacare needs incentives and tools that really work to get more Americans insured.\nWith the third round of open enrollment starting Sunday, there\u2019s another Obamacare tax that\u2019s due for a rethink: the penalty for not carrying insurance.\nThose who really don\u2019t want coverage could still opt out.\nAnd to provide a sharper nudge, the law also levies significant fines on those who don\u2019t get coverage."}
