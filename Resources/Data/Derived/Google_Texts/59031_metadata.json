The change should further promote the interoperability of devices, he said, a major goal for his organization.\u201cYou can save money, time, and probably prevent a lot of adverse events by having information move smoothly from one device to another,\u201d Smith said. \u201cInstead of people running around, writing things on the edges of their scrubs, and then moving them from one device to another,\u201d he said, entrepreneurs will be able to provide software solutions that convey the information seamlessly, and they'll be encouraged by the new freedom to do so.The move also marks another shift in the broader debate about digital healthcare and its governmental regulation. The FDA\u2014along with the Federal Communications Commission and HHS' Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology\u2014have been working to craft an oversight framework for the sector.Some critics, however, argue that digital healthcare needs to be even more independent from regulation to achieve its full potential\u2014and the debate has become political. Lawmakers in the House and Senate have introduced bills that define a more circumscribed federal role. Recently, House Republicans sent a letter to ONC head Dr. Karen DeSalvo asking whether the agency had the statutory authority to carry out its proposed responsibilities under the draft framework it has introduced with the FCC and the FDA.Patel's blog post addresses that debate. While drafting the framework, he wrote, the FDA \u201csought extensive public feedback\u201d and the decision to further deregulate such data systems came \u201cin light of those discussions.\u201dWest Health's Smith, who served on a work group that advised the three federal agencies on their proposed framework, said he was glad that the change honors that process by responding to input. \u201cI think there's been a drumbeat of deregulation\u201d of digital health by the FDA, Smith concluded, and he welcomes it.Bradley Thompson, a lawyer at Epstein Becker Green, also served on the work group. Thompson felt it was a big, welcome change, but raised one objection as a \u201cnerdy lawyer\u201d: \u201cI'm pretty bothered that they are choosing to do this through a guidance document. That's a sloppy way to regulate. There is a regulation on the books that needs to be changed.\u201dSome industry sources suggested that the change might also allow data systems to avoid the medical-device excise tax imposed under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Shielding the digital health sector from the tax has been a key aim of lawmakers pushing legislation that frees manufacturers from regulation. The House and Senate bills would explicitly remove \u201cclinical software and health software\u201d from the realm of medical devices subject to federal regulation.Thompson, however, isn't buying it. \u201cI'm not sure that's true, although I suspect some people think it is.\u201d He explained that the regulation referring to data systems as medical devices remains in effect, meaning that they could still be taxed. That uncertainty is one weakness of the FDA's use of guidance rather than rulemaking, Thompson said.Follow Darius Tahir on Twitter: @dariustahir", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "As recently as January 2011, the Food and Drug Administration judged medical-device data systems\u2014medical devices and software intended to facilitate the flow and storage of data\u2014to be among the highest-risk technologies in healthcare.
