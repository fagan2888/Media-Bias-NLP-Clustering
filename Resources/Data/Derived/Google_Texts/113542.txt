Sports Authority Field at Mile High is 1,101 miles from Lambeau Field, but Denver felt like the frozen tundra late Sunday afternoon, as only the hardiest fans with the warmest feelings for the Broncos braved the 23-degree temperature and face-chapping 79-percent humidity.

“Ice-cold water,” called out Alma Bravo, with a smile on her face a block from the stadium.

Surprisingly, there were takers, passing her $2 for a bottle that she plucked from and an ice-filled cooler.

“Thirsty’s thirsty no matter how cold it gets,” said customer Jeff Allen of Lakewood, bundled up in so many layers he looked like the Michelin Man.

But thirsty is about all that felt normal Sunday night, as people tailgated huddled near propane heaters and speaking through scarves.

“This would kill a Tampa Bay fan,” said Alberto Rogers, a New England Patriots fan who flew in for the game. “For guys like us in Denver and Boston, it’s a day at the park.”

With world events being what they’ve been lately, security was tight Sunday night. Fans pawed with numb fingers to pull out phones and car keys before passing through metal detectors.

The Broncos allowed in blankets, but advised that people drape them over their shoulders to keep the security lines moving.

“I wish it wasn’t this way; I mean it’s bitterly awful standing out here,” said Ellen Buckner of Greenwood Village, who rarely misses a game, rain, shine or risk of frostbite. “But people have to understand this is the world we live in, a world with Paris (terrorist attacks) and Colorado (Planned Parenthood clinic shooting). You just don’t know who’s coming in behind you and what they have in mind.”

By 10 p.m. Sunday, when fans will be returning to their vehicles to go home, weather forecasters expect a 20-degree chill, 92 percent humidity, light snow and a 4 mph breeze.

It might not be Green Bay, but it sure won’t be Tampa Bay.
