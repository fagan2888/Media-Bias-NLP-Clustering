In the final game, North got within a point at 20-19 but ended up falling 25-21.\n\n\"We're just really young, and we're probably going to have to take our lumps early on,\" Lady Knight veteran coach Sue Moon said. \"They just have a few more weapons than we do.\"\n\nNorth's main weapon was junior power hitter Caroline Marsh, who finished the night with 24 kills and six blocks. The reigning Times-News Volleyball Player of the Year led Western North Carolina in kills last season with 586 kills.\n\nEvery time Marsh put down a kill against Enka, Sugar Jet senior Sallyanne Johnson answered back with a kill of her own. Kloyee Anderson, Abbie Trantham and Bailee Trantham were her supporting cast and had tips and dump kills that kept North's defense off balance.\n\nSenior Alex Oates had a double double with 14 assists and 12 digs, and senior Megan Edwards had 12 digs to lead the defense.\n\nThe Lady Knights will have an eight-day break before returning to action on Aug. 27 at home against A.C. Reynolds.\n\nIn Tuesday's JV opener, North won 2-1 over Enka.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tuesday's volleyball season opener between Enka and North Henderson was close throughout even though the Sugar Jets won the match in straight sets, 3-0.", "vf": {"unique_id": "art-01726B1F-F2D4-428D-A86F-AD99ACE5243F-pubHT"}, "og": {"site_name": "BlueRidgeNow.com", "description": "Tuesday's volleyball season opener between Enka and North Henderson was close throughout even though the Sugar Jets won the match in straight sets, 3-0.", "title": "North Henderson falls 3-0 to Enka", "url": "http://www.blueridgenow.com/article/20150818/PREPS/150819898", "image": "http://G52-HTweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=HT&Date=20150818&Category=PREPS&ArtNo=150819898&Ref=AR&imageVersion=Teaser", "type": "article"}, "publishdate": 20150818, "fb": {"app_id": 123380601066653}, "tout": {"article": {"id": "art-150819898-pubHT"}}, "keywords": "HENDERSONVILLE (NC),  Volleyball,  Yahoo!,  Article,  Update,  North Henderson High School,  HENDERSONVILLE (NC),  Volleyball,  Yahoo!,  Article,  Update,  North Henderson High School", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdad0a\"", "article_summary": "Tuesday's volleyball season opener between Enka and North Henderson was close throughout even though the Sugar Jets won the match in straight sets, 3-0.\nIn Tuesday's JV opener, North won 2-1 over Enka.\nEvery time Marsh put down a kill against Enka, Sugar Jet senior Sallyanne Johnson answered back with a kill of her own.\nThe reigning Times-News Volleyball Player of the Year led Western North Carolina in kills last season with 586 kills.\nEnka took the first game 25-21 and scored the final three points of the second to win it 25-22."}
