He was, you know, raised white,\u201d said the world-renowned neurosurgeon, whose single mother worked three jobs \u2013 and occasionally relied on government aid \u2013 to elevate Carson and his older brother from the grinding poverty of ghetto life.\n\n\u201cI mean, like most Americans, I was proud that we broke the color barrier when he was elected, but \u2026 he didn\u2019t grow up like I grew up \u2026 Many of his formative years were spent in Indonesia. So, for him to, you know, claim that, you know, he identifies with the experience of black Americans, I think, is a bit of a stretch.\u201d\n\nCarson also suggested that what passes for racism now \u2013 in the age of Ferguson and Freddie Gray \u2013 isn\u2019t comparable to the overt discrimination he encountered a half-century ago as a young man.\n\n\u201cRemember now, I\u2019ve been around for 64 years, you know,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve had a chance to see what real racism is.\u201d\n\nCarson has largely, if not entirely, downplayed the role of race in his brief rise. But as he fades (and many Republicans are calling for him to drop out for the sake of stopping Donald Trump if he flops, as expected, tonight in Nevada), he\u2019s begun to expound more on his views on the role of race in the country. Touring through South Carolina, the sword-tip of the segregation movement and one of the most racially polarized states in the country, put him in a reflective mood \u2013 and he made a point of campaigning in black neighborhoods and African-American college campuses last week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I pressed Carson on whether he\u2019d experienced any racism in today\u2019s Republican Party, though, he flatly denied it \u2013 and said the real issue was progressives who couldn\u2019t accept the existence of a truly conservative black man. \u201cThey assume because you\u2019re black, you have to think a certain way,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t think that way, you\u2019re \u2018Uncle Tom,\u2019 you\u2019re worthy of every horrible epithet they can come up with; whereas, if I weren\u2019t black, then I would just be a Republican.\u201d\n\nYet, for a nanosecond, he admitted that he\u2019s not exactly on the lookout for racists lurking in a party that is, by most estimates, about 90 percent white \u2013 with blacks like Carson making up just two percent of the total. \u201cI don\u2019t find any particular problem being an African American in the Republican Party,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he quickly added: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just very nonobservant. You know, I don\u2019t go around looking for things, and you have to understand that whatever you think is going on is probably what you\u2019re going to see. So, if somebody told you that you\u2019re about to meet somebody and they\u2019re really a mass murderer and they\u2019re just looking for an opportunity to kill you, everything they say, you\u2019re going to say, 'Uh\u2011huh, I see what he\u2019s trying to do.' Whereas, if they told you the very same person really loves everybody and is looking for a way to enhance them and the very same thing,you say, \u2018Oh, wow, yeah, that\u2019s really good.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt that point, I admitted to being a little befuddled. I\u2019ve personally witnessed racist comments at events staged for candidates in both parties \u2013 the most recent being at a Trump rally in Lowell, Massachusetts earlier this year when I witnessed two young men calling a pro-immigrant protester a \u201cnigger.\u201d Back in 2008, I heard a Clinton supporter in Toledo, Ohio use the same epithet to describe then-Sen. Obama.\n\nCarson was steadfast in defending his party (this is a candidate who has said a Muslim shouldn\u2019t run for president unless he or she renounces sharia law) and when I asked him if Trump was a racist, he replied, \u201cI have not witnessed anything that would make me say that about him.\u201d\n\nBut when I followed up with a question about Trump\u2019s general tone on racial issues, he shook his head: \u201cNo, it\u2019s not the tone that I would use. Absolutely not.\u201d\n\nOne of the great ironies of 2016 is that Carson, a free-market conservative who rose by railing against big-government Obamacare, views race through the larger prism of class \u2013 putting him (very) roughly more on the Bernie Sanders side of the race-vs.-class argument.\n\nWhen I ask him if racism played a role in the contaminated water crisis in Flint, Michigan, he says, \u201cLet me put it this way: If that were going on in an affluent black community, it would have not gone on,\u201d adding: \u201cA lot of things that people classify as racism is classism, and, believe me, there's a lot of classism in our society, and if people of a certain race happen to fall into a lower class, then they get the brunt of it.\u201d\n\nThere was a time, at the end of 2015, when Carson seemed poised to challenge Trump \u2013 but a series of setbacks, languid debate performances and the near-collapse of his campaign from mismanagement scuttled the effort. At the Embassy Suites here on election night, several of his staff and volunteers could be heard musing about what they planned to do when \u2013 not if \u2013 he dropped out. Still, Carson has a substantial war-chest and a still-functional online fundraising operation and professed to be in for the long haul, without a lot of force behind the statement.\n\n\u201cWell, I don't have any immediate plans of cessation,\u201d he says.\n\nOutside observers have suggested Carson is soldiering on through Nevada to thumb his nose at Ted Cruz, whose campaign floated the rumor that he was about to drop out of the race during the Iowa caucuses. Cruz has repeatedly apologized \u2013 and blamed his staff\u2019s actions, dubiously, on a CNN report \u2013 and he tried his luck again in a private meeting here; Carson \u201cwasn\u2019t impressed,\u201d a staffer later told me. And the candidate himself cast doubt on the Texas senator\u2019s contrition tour.\n\n\u201cAs a Christian, I do accept his apology, but, you know, God forgives us when we sin, but he doesn\u2019t remove the consequences,\u201d he says \u2013 and sure enough, a couple of days later, Cruz sacked a top aide for playing a dirty trick on Marco Rubio.\n\nThe central theme of Carson\u2019s inspiring personal story is his triumph over a self-destructive, volcanic temper though the salvation of his Christian faith. This makes him an unusual candidate and an unusual person \u2013 with a clerical, un-Trump-like tendency towards self-reflection and admitting his own shortcomings (he says he\u2019s stopped providing so much \u201clip service\u201d \u2013 controversial comments \u2013 to reporters like me who obscure his compassionate conservative message). In person, he projects an unnerving calm, and when you sit with him a while you can see the mechanism of this reflexive self-soothing: Ask a tough or annoying question and he closes his eyelids \u2013 full stop \u2013 and opens them slowly, with a Gautama smile, rolling out an answer with deliberation and care.\n\n\u201cAs a pediatric neurosurgeon, when you\u2019re deep in somebody's brain and a blood vessel pops, if you panic, the patient is dead,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou have to be very calm. You have to keep everybody else very calm, and you will generally find that neurosurgeons are calm people.\u201d\n\nC\u2019mon, Dr. Carson, I want to know, don\u2019t you ever get angry?\n\n\u201cI generally don\u2019t, you know,\u201d he replies. \u201cIf I\u2019m, you know, working with a very obnoxious person, you know, I just say, \u2018That used to be a cute little baby. I wonder what happened to them.\u2019\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "&quot;I\u2019ve had a chance to see what real racism is,&quot; he says.", "title": "Ben Carson: Obama was \u2018raised white\u2019", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/ben-carson-obama-was-raised-white-219657", "image": "http://static.politico.com/c7/92/f87b44014f1699d0a9c28d739f10/160223-ben-carson-bm-1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "&quot;I\u2019ve had a chance to see what real racism is,&quot; he says.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "GREENVILLE, S.C. \u2013 Ben Carson is the only person in the 2016 presidential field who is vying to become the country\u2019s second African-American president.\nYou have to keep everybody else very calm, and you will generally find that neurosurgeons are calm people.\u201dC\u2019mon, Dr. Carson, I want to know, don\u2019t you ever get angry?\n\u201cThey assume because you\u2019re black, you have to think a certain way,\u201d he said.\nHe was, you know, raised white,\u201d said the world-renowned neurosurgeon, whose single mother worked three jobs \u2013 and occasionally relied on government aid \u2013 to elevate Carson and his older brother from the grinding poverty of ghetto life.\n\u201cIf I\u2019m, you know, working with a very obnoxious person, you know, I just say, \u2018That used to be a cute little baby."}
