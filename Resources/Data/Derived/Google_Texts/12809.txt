SCOTTSDALE, ariz. —

With the Rockies about halfway through spring training, it’s a good time to share some opinions and impressions:

• A close friend of Troy Tulowitzki’s insists Tulo wasn’t taking a premeditated shot at the Rockies last week when he told USA Today that the Rockies’ complex at Salt River Fields “was like a country club.” Tulo, his friend told me, was mostly trying to express how comfortable he feels at the Toronto Blue Jays’ complex, as outdated as it is.

Maybe so, but Tulo’s words — meant mostly for general manager Jeff Bridich and owner Dick Monfort — still stung. It was a dumb thing to say. What really ticked off Rockies players was Tulowitzki’s comment, “Guys got comfortable because it was so nice.”

The most common refrain around Salt River Fields? It’s past time for Tulo to get over last summer’s trade.

• Carlos Gonzalez is not only in terrific shape, he seems happier and more relaxed in camp than he has been in years. Not having to endure rehab all winter is a big reason for that. If he’s worried about trade rumors catching fire again this summer, he’s sure not showing it.

• I tweeted out a photo of Gonzalez the first week of camp, and a lot of fans noticed how huge his biceps are. For a major-league outfielder, it’s not always wise to build up big guns, the theory being that big biceps can negatively affect the throwing motion.

CarGo says he’s not worried.

“What’s important for me when I’m lifting hard is I want to be flexible, so I stretched a lot with my upper body and my lower body,” Gonzalez told Thomas Harding of MLB.com. “After working out, I was sure that I’d run and I always played catch. It was part of my routine.

“It can affect you if you don’t throw. I’d lift in the mornings, work pretty hard, then run. And in the afternoon, I’d do my whole baseball program so that it doesn’t affect me.”

• Looking for a dark-horse candidate to make the roster? Try right-handed relief prospect Carlos Estevez. In his first two Cactus League outings, the 23-year-old stuck out five, showing a blazing fastball. He’s also beginning to master a nasty slider. He struck out 68 in 55 ⅔ combined relief innings at Single-A Advanced Modesto and Double-A New Britain last season.

“Power arm with very good secondary stuff, too. He’s got a great changeup,” manager Walt Weiss said. “There’s some deception there, too, with his delivery. It’s a little funky. He’s looked good so far.”

• If I were Bridich, I would be thinking very hard about making Trevor Story my starting shortstop. If I’m Weiss, I push for it to happen.

I think Story, 23, is ready for the majors right now — and not just because he hit a 442-foot homer last week.

Story impresses me with his work ethic, athleticism and passion. Still, history tells us the Rockies could make Story wait a bit longer. In 2013, Nolan Arenado played 18 games at Triple-A Colorado Springs, where he batted .364 with 14 extra-base hits, before he got the call.

• Raimel Tapia, the 6-foot-2, 165-pound outfielder, has caught a lot of attention early in spring. He flags down balls in the gap with great speed and an excellent jump. He has an unorthodox approach at the plate, but, as Clint Hurdle likes to say, “The kid puts the barrel to the baseball.”

Tapia, 22, probably will begin the season at Double-A Hartford, but he’s an exciting player and worth keeping an eye on.
