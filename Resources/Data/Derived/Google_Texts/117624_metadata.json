Ted Cruz, R-Texas, delivered a speech Tuesday on the Senate floor in support of the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act, legislation he co-sponsored that would deny some federal funds to \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d or jurisdictions that don\u2019t uphold federal immigration law.\n\nThe legislation was later defeated in a 54-45 vote; it needed 60 votes to advance. The White House has indicated that the president would veto the legislation.\n\n\u201cAmericans are tired of seeing their laws flouted and their communities plagued by the horrible crime that typically accompanies illegal immigration,\u201d said Cruz. \u201cBut for too long, the pleas of the American people on this issue have gone unheeded here in Washington.\u201d\n\nCruz accused \u201cthe political class and the business class\u2014our nation\u2019s elites\u201d of promising \u201cenforcement at some point in the future but only on the condition that the American people accept a pathway to citizenship now for the millions of illegal immigrants who are already in this country.\u201d\n\nCruz said the Obama administration\u2019s \u201crefusal to enforce the laws\u201d isn\u2019t the only problem, but also the \u201cscandalously poor enforcement of our immigration laws,\u201d and that the legislation would rein in the \u201clawlessness\u201d of the jurisdictions.\n\n\u201cAlthough these jurisdictions are more than happy\u2014eager, even\u2014to take federal dollars, they go out of their way to impede federal immigration enforcement by adopting policies that prohibit their law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal officers. Some of the jurisdictions even refuse to honor requests from the federal government to temporarily hold a criminal alien until federal officers can take custody of the individual.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only are these sanctuary policies an affront to rule of law; they are extremely dangerous,\u201d Cruz added.\n\nCruz said that in 2013, the Obama administration \u201creleased from detention roughly 36,000 convicted criminal aliens who were actually awaiting the outcome of deportation proceedings.\u201d\n\nAccording to Cruz, these \u201ccriminal illegal aliens\u201d accounted for 193 homicide convictions, 426 sexual assault convictions, 303 kidnapping convictions, 1,075 aggravated assault convictions, and 16,070 convictions of driving under the influence of alcohol.\n\n\u201cAll of this was on top of the additional 68,000 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions that the federal government encountered in 2013 but never took into custody for deportation.\u201d\n\nHe called the legislation \u201cjust a small step, but at least it is a step in the right direction.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must send the message that defiance of our laws will no longer be tolerated\u2014whether it is by the sanctuary cities themselves or the illegal re-entry offenders that they harbor,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThe problem of illegal immigration in this country will never be solved until we demonstrate to the American people that we are serious about securing the border and enforcing our immigration laws\u2014until we have a president willing to, and in fact committed to actually enforcing the laws and securing the borders.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Signal recently reported that there are currently 340 sanctuary cities in the United States.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Watch his fiery speech on the senate floor.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Watch his fiery speech on the senate floor.", "title": "Cruz on Sanctuary Cities: \u2018Defiance of Our Laws Will No Longer be Tolerated\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151020_CruzSpeech_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-20T16:50:15+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1jS1QB1"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Watch his fiery speech on the senate floor.", "title": "Cruz on Sanctuary Cities: \u2018Defiance of Our Laws Will No Longer be Tolerated\u2019", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151020_CruzSpeech_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-10-20T15:37:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-20T16:50:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Sanctuary cities, illegal immigration, Ted Cruz, immigration, secure borders, amnesty"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f3f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAmericans are tired of seeing their laws flouted and their communities plagued by the horrible crime that typically accompanies illegal immigration,\u201d said Cruz.\n\u201cAlthough these jurisdictions are more than happy\u2014eager, even\u2014to take federal dollars, they go out of their way to impede federal immigration enforcement by adopting policies that prohibit their law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal officers.\nThe legislation was later defeated in a 54-45 vote; it needed 60 votes to advance.\nThe White House has indicated that the president would veto the legislation.\nSen.
