Instead, in a remarkable turnaround, he embraced his original love of reading, got a college degree and now is in his first year of studies at Yale Law School.\n\nBetts, 32, has become a national spokesman for a program called the Campaign for Youth Justice, which is fighting the practice of trying troubled youth in adult courts instead of in juvenile justice systems.\n\nBetts has succeeded after incarceration, but he insists that sending kids to do hard time in grown-up prisons exposes them to violence, abuse and even encourages some to try suicide.\n\nIf you want a kid to become productive upon leaving jail, \u201cwhy send him to the place where he\u2019s most likely to be damaged?\u201d Betts said.\n\nBetts visited the Center for Manifestation church in East Tampa on Saturday for a forum on juvenile justice, organized by the Tampa Interfaith Coalition for Juvenile Justice, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Campaign for Youth Justice.\n\nSpeakers blasted the \u201cprison industrial complex\u201d that is driven by profit and leaves children with the lifelong scar of a felony conviction, making it hard to find work and an apartment.\n\nBetts somehow made it over those hurdles, and he now lives in Connecticut with his wife and two young sons.\n\nHe was a smart kid as a teenager, a voracious reader who made the honor roll in a Maryland suburb of Washington, D.C. He grew up with a single mother who had a good job with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and he didn\u2019t consider his family poor.\n\nBetts\u2019 good grades masked troubling signs beneath the surface, he said. He never had been in trouble with the law, but began skipping school and smoking marijuana. He didn\u2019t rob people or get violent, but he hung around kids who did.\n\nAssociating with the wrong people caught up with him when he was 16. According to a 2006 account in the Washington Post, Betts and some friends drove to a suburban Virginia shopping mall and found a man sleeping in his car. Betts pointed a gun at the man, they stole his wallet and drove off with his car. Police caught up with him shortly after when they tried to use the man\u2019s stolen credit card to buy clothes, the article said.\n\nToday, Betts said he wasn\u2019t a bad kid, but got caught up in the moment. He didn\u2019t even know the man whose gun he borrowed that day. He\u2019s not sure who came up with the idea to car-jack someone.\n\n\u201cYou know how groupthink works,\u201d he said. \u201cYou start untangling threads and you don\u2019t know whose idea it was.\u201d\n\nBetts was tried as an adult and spent eight years incarcerated, including long stretches in solitary confinement. His life might have gone downhill from there, but instead he embraced his love of reading and usually got through six books a month.\n\nHe also got breaks along the way that others often don\u2019t get, including help from a bookstore owner who gave him a job and let him start a book club for young people.\n\n\u201cHe not only gave me a chance, he gave me the keys to the store,\u201d Betts said of the store owner.\n\nEventually, Betts won a scholarship to the University of Maryland, landed adjunct professor positions at various colleges and most recently started at Yale.\n\nToday he speaks about the horrors of life as a 120-pound kid in a grown man\u2019s prison. Beatings were commonplace, stabbings happened occasionally and he would hear of young people trying to kill themselves.\n\nAround Florida activists are tackling what they call an overly aggressive juvenile justice system. David Utter, policy and legislative director for the SPLC in Florida, said his group is pushing an alternative to arresting youth accused of first-time misdemeanors.\n\nInstead of arresting them, give them something called a civil citation that punishes them but doesn\u2019t give them a criminal record, he said.\n\nIn Miami, 85 percent of kids accused of a first-time misdemeanor get a citation instead of an arrest, but in Hillsborough County, that figure is just 37 percent, Utter said, citing Florida Department of Juvenile Justice reports.\n\nCritics say a civil citation is nothing more than a slap on the wrist, Utter acknowledges. But, he insists the alternative isn\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cFor years, we in Florida have been addicted to criminalizing adolescent misbehavior through arrests, putting kids in detention,\u201d he said.\n\nmsasso@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7865\n\nTwitter: @msasso", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 19 Oct 2013 17:01:22 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 If the TV studios ever make an \u201cExtreme Makeover: Life Edition,\u201d they might start with Reginald \u201cDwayne\u201d Betts.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 If the TV studios ever make an \u201cExtreme Makeover: Life Edition,\u201d they might start with Reginald \u201cDwayne\u201d Betts.", "title": "Criminal turned law student says prison no place for some young offenders", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/news/breaking-news/all/criminal-turned-law-student-says-prison-no-place-for-some-young-offenders-20131019/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2013-10-19T17:01:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Criminal turned law student says prison no place for some young offenders"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-10-19T17:01:22Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-10-19T17:01:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd28b3\"", "article_summary": "Betts visited the Center for Manifestation church in East Tampa on Saturday for a forum on juvenile justice, organized by the Tampa Interfaith Coalition for Juvenile Justice, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Campaign for Youth Justice.\nAround Florida activists are tackling what they call an overly aggressive juvenile justice system.\nBetts somehow made it over those hurdles, and he now lives in Connecticut with his wife and two young sons.\nBetts, 32, has become a national spokesman for a program called the Campaign for Youth Justice, which is fighting the practice of trying troubled youth in adult courts instead of in juvenile justice systems.\n\u201cFor years, we in Florida have been addicted to criminalizing adolescent misbehavior through arrests, putting kids in detention,\u201d he said."}
