Why is that?\n\nThe reason points to a little wrinkle in the public domain, one that commonly plagues classical works: While the music is technically in the public domain (and you are free to play it, perform it, record it however you like), recordings of these public-domain works tend to be copyrighted. (You can thank this little wrinkle for all the terrible \"hold\" music you've been subjected to over the years.)\n\nA Kickstarter project, \"Set Chopin Free,\" aims to do exactly what its name suggests: Release Chopin recordings from their copyright cell.\n\nHere's how it works: If the project successfully meets its fundraising goal ($75,000 by Sunday, October 20), it will hire musicians (some of the best Chopin pianists in the world) to record and release to the public under a CC0 license the entirety of Chopin's life's work, some 245 pieces. Then, if you're making a movie (or writing a Wikipedia page, or a blog post, or whatever else you might be doing) and looking for that particular Nocturne, you'll have a place to turn to.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new Kickstarter project aims to liberate the composer&#39;s music from its copyright confines.", "author": "Rebecca J.
