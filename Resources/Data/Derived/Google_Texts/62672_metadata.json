If front-runner Donald Trump shows up, it will be the first time all the major GOP candidates will meet in one place since the Iowa caucuses, which saw Texas Sen. Ted Cruz emerge victorious and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson head home to change clothes. Trump, who skipped the last debate in Iowa, has asked for a redo there.\n\nSaturday night promises to be as crazy as ever for the Republicans, especially since the field has narrowed to 10 candidates, and only seven of them are being allowed on stage. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee dropped out after Iowa. ABC News also announced there'll be no undercard debate this time around, upping the stakes for candidates hoping to make it to the next round.\n\nIf that Hunger Games-like description didn't excite you, this drinking game will. We won't judge \u2014 it's Saturday night and you're watching politicians yell at each other on a stage \u2014 but make sure you imbibe responsibly. Pick a candidate or two and follow these rules collected from Debate Drinking, Lions of Liberty and the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images\n\nDrink whenever your candidate...\n\n...keeps speaking after the buzzer sounds.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\n...talks over someone else (moderators included).\n\n...attacks Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.\n\n...says \"ISIS,\" \"ISIL\" or \"terrorists.\"\n\n...references his poll numbers as evidence of success (ahem, Trump).\n\n...vows to bring back jobs for \"American families.\"\n\n...denounces the Iran deal or Affordable Care Act.\n\n...alludes to \"when I'm president.\"\n\n...interrupts by arguing that \"my name was mentioned.\"\n\n...tells you the URL to his or her campaign website (as if we don't know who they are by now).\n\nGOP debate drinking game: take a shot every time someone mentions Reagan \u2014 Jackie Schlag (@_jSchlag) January 29, 2016\n\nAnd drink whenever any candidate...\n\n...looks sleepy on stage.\n\n...says the word \"emails.\"\n\n...mentions Clinton's rival, Vermont Sen.
