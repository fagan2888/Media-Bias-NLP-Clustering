Searchers reached aircraft wreckage Sunday night on a mountainside west of Silverton in southwestern Colorado and confirmed a plane crash.

The Civil Air Patrol had been searching for a Texas-bound small plane that went missing Sunday afternoon.

San Juan County authorities could not speak directly about the wreckage but relayed a message from the scene: “Ground teams have reached the wreckage and are securing the site for a morning investigation. No identification of aircraft or occupants.”

It was unclear whether anybody survived the crash.

CAP officials said a plane, apparently carrying two people who haven’t been identified, went missing.

Radar and cellphone forensics indicated the plane left California on Sunday morning and lost radio contact near Grizzly Peak (elevation 13,736 feet), south of Telluride, CAP Col. Mike Daniels said.

An Air Care helicopter from Dolores County happened to be in the area. The pilot spotted wreckage, then notified authorities in Dolores County. They contacted San Juan County authorities, who dispatched a ground crew.

A CAP search aircraft, taking off from Grand Junction around 3:30 p.m. did not find wreckage and returned Sunday as the sun went down.

The missing plane, a Cessna 310-H, departed Barstow, Calif., Daniels said, and was headed to Amarillo, Texas.
