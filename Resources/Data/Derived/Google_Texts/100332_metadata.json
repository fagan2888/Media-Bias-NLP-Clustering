Four trends indicate cost and relative value will become major issues in cancer care management down the road:\n\nRise in demand and prevalence. Cancer, already the cause of 25 percent of deaths in the United States, is projected to be the leading cause of death nationwide by 2030. Breast, lung, prostate and colon cancers are the most common, but liver, pancreatic and kidney cancer diagnoses have ramped up in the last 15 years. This hhas significantly expanding the market for cancer care and spurring similar expansions of programs at providers such as Cleveland Clinic, as well as triggering cancer center construction.\n\nHigher survival rates. Since reaching an all-time high in 1991, cancer mortality rates are down 22 percent, Keckley writes. As the population ages, increasing their risk of cancer, the number of survivors will increase. That means cancer is an increasingly larger piece of the population health management puzzle for providers.\n\nPublic attention. The general public knows cancer survival rates are improving, but this remains a major anxiety, according to Keckley. Providers such as Huntsman Cancer Institute and drug manufacturers increasingly advertise directly to consumers. Cancer in general has gone from a death sentence for patients to a chronic condition--albeit one with a particularly stressful management process.\n\nRising costs. Cancer care costs will increase to more than $173 billion a year by 2020, about $70 billion more than 2006. Cancer medication costs, for example, rose 20 times faster than the Consumer Price Index since 2000.\n\nCancer care outcomes, Keckley writes, are \"not guaranteed by our rich legacy--until and unless the relative value question about cancer care management is addressed forthrightly in a meaningful public discussion, its future is uncertain, reserved for fewer and fewer who can afford it.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the column\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nCancer patients more likely to file for bankruptcy\n\nHospitals in midst of cancer center building boom\n\nHospitals compete for cancer patients\n\nTreat patients who can't pay?
