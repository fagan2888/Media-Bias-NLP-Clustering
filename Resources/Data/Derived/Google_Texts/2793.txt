Unknown hackers have crippled multiple Thai police websites to protest the trial of two Myanmar migrant workers who were sentenced to death last month for murdering a pair of British tourists, Reuters reports.

A 37-minute video posted to the Facebook page of the hacking group Anonymous on Sunday questioned how the case was handled and cast doubt on the competency of the Thai police force.

The group claimed 14 sites were disabled. Nine were still unavailable on Tuesday, according to Reuters.

Some of the hacked sites contained displays of the words “Failed Law,” “We Want Justice” and the hashtag #BoycottThailand, as well as the name of a Myanmar-based hacking group known as “Blink Hacker Group.”

Police have confirmed the attacks, but say that none of the targeted sites contained confidential information.

"They're not good enough to hack into our system and steal any of our data," a spokesman said.

A Thai court sentenced Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun to death on Dec. 24, in a case that has drawn allegations of police incompetence, mishandling of evidence and torture of the two suspects.

The workers have been convicted of the murder of two backpackers, Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, whose battered bodies were found on an island beach in September 2014.

In Thailand, trials have no jury and the sentence is delivered by a judge. The verdict has sparked protests in Myanmar that forced the Thai embassy in Yangon to close, as well as outcry on social media.

Protesters believe the two defendants are being used as scapegoats.
