Faces on the screen mumbled words that, let\u2019s be honest, couldn\u2019t be heard well over the stadium\u2019s shoddy sound system, yet \u201cit\u2019s on us\u201d was repeated again and again.\n\nNear the end, the faces and voices unified to say, \u201cIt\u2019s on us to stop sexual assault.\u201d There was a pause, and President Obama appeared on the screen.\n\nBut before he opened his mouth, the student section booed \u2014 arguably louder than they booed the Nebraska band.\n\nI was stunned. Not stunned that the stadium booed Obama, but that they booed the message Obama\u2019s face was attached to.\n\nBetween this and students leaving at, or well before, halftime, our student section this year has been absolutely awful.\n\nMark Hollis and Mark Dantonio have both expressed their disappointment in the student section. But the issue is not only with the dwindling numbers. This was the cherry on top.\n\n\u201cStop sexual assault.\u201d That\u2019s what the message said. Not \u201cWe\u2019re giving aid to Syrian troops to fight against ISIS,\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nNo. The message the White House sent in that 30-second block was a universal one. It wasn\u2019t partisan. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re liberal, conservative, moderate, white, black, green, old, young, male, female, scrambled or sunny-side up. I don\u2019t care if you like Obama or not, because everybody is entitled to their own opinions, but sexual assault needs to stop because it is wrong.\n\nAnd yes, it is on us \u00ad\u2014 all of us \u2014 to take steps toward ending it.\n\nThe White House is saying we need to change the culture that has made the discussion of sexual assault taboo, the culture that blames victims and excuses unacceptable behavior because \u201cboys will be boys\u201d or \u201cshe asked for it.\u201d\n\nThe student section booed that incredibly important message just because they saw Obama\u2019s face.\n\nNow, I do believe that students should take issue with the president. The U.S. government needs to be challenged and questioned on many issues.\n\nBut as an MSU student and a citizen of this country, I\u2019m disgusted. Not only that our student section can\u2019t be bothered to figure out what the hell they\u2019re actually booing, but that sexual assault is taken as such a joke that it\u2019s considered cool or funny to boo at an ad campaign for ending it. It is nothing short of childish.\n\nI understand that a football game was perhaps not the right time to air that ad. Sure, it would reach a wide audience, but that audience was in the middle of cheering on a team winning (at the time) by a landslide. I know that football games are supposed to be fun and have a healthy, competitive rivalry. I\u2019ve joined my voice countless times with the thousands of others shouting the vulgar, offensive chants directed toward another team, because it\u2019s all in good fun.\n\nBut ending sexual assault is never, ever a joke. It is something that should always be taken seriously, even at a football game.\n\nIn this case, silence would have been better than boos. But students, please speak out against sexual assault. We are better than our collective behavior at that game. We\u2019re Spartans and we need to stand up for what\u2019s right \u2014 not boo our president for taking initiative against an important issue.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://cdn.thesn.net/2016052471eeLX2LpW/dist/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "description": "At the Nebraska game this Saturday at Spartan Stadium, an ad came on the big screens for The White House\u2019s It\u2019s On Us campaign, which is a call to arms for everyone ? yes, everyone, \u201cnot just men\u201d ? to stop perpetuating the culture that generates sexual assault.The stadium watched quietly as the commercial played.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160208900 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"site_name": "The State News", "description": "At the Nebraska game this Saturday at Spartan Stadium, an ad came on the big screens for The White House\u2019s It\u2019s On Us campaign, which is a call to arms for everyone ? yes, everyone, \u201cnot just men\u201d ? to stop perpetuating the culture that generates sexual assault.The stadium watched quietly as the commercial played.", "title": "Student section booing \"It's On Us\" campaign ad is disrespectful", "url": "http://statenews.com/article/2014/10/student-section-booing-its-on-us", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.tsn/67910_mug_jenks_emilyf.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.tsn/67910_mug_jenks_emilyf.jpg", "site": "@thesnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "TheStateNews", "fb": {"pages": 62758758853}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.thesn.net/2016052471eeLX2LpW/dist/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "TheStateNews", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd241f\"", "article_summary": "Not stunned that the stadium booed Obama, but that they booed the message Obama\u2019s face was attached to.\nBut before he opened his mouth, the student section booed \u2014 arguably louder than they booed the Nebraska band.\nNot only that our student section can\u2019t be bothered to figure out what the hell they\u2019re actually booing, but that sexual assault is taken as such a joke that it\u2019s considered cool or funny to boo at an ad campaign for ending it.\n\u201cStop sexual assault.\u201d That\u2019s what the message said.\nNear the end, the faces and voices unified to say, \u201cIt\u2019s on us to stop sexual assault.\u201d There was a pause, and President Obama appeared on the screen."}
