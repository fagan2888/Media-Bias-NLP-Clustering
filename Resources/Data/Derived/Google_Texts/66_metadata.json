More than half of all pregnant women, surgical patients and cancer patients experience nausea and vomiting, and up to a quarter of all people struggle with chronic nausea.\n\nAnd, of course, millions are affected every year by the nausea that comes with nasty stomach bugs such as the norovirus.\n\nYet we still have few effective treatments for nausea. Over-the-counter medications such as Dramamine cause sedation, and the most effective prescription drugs, such as Zofran, diminish nausea in fewer than half of patients, experts say.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we have more drugs to help this?\u201d asks Kenneth L. Koch, a professor of gastroenterology at Wake Forest School of Medicine. \u201cA cold washcloth is about what we have. Nausea doesn\u2019t get the respect it should. People say, 'If you don\u2019t like the nausea, then get off the merry-go-round.' \u201d\n\nBut this isn\u2019t an option for people with the chronic and severe nausea that comes with conditions such as hyperemesis gravidarum \u2014 or HG \u2014 a brutal form of nausea that affects nearly 10 percent of pregnant women (including the Duchess of Cambridge, formerly Kate Middleton) and can lead to dehydration, malnutrition and hospitalization.\n\nKoch is working to understand nausea and develop more effective treatments by tracking the electrical activity of the stomachs of nauseated volunteers.\n\nThe stomach has an electrical rhythm to control its churning action, which runs at three cycles per minute. In his tests, Koch found that these rhythms were disrupted, running either too fast or too slow. He\u2019d like to find a way to use electrical stimulation or drugs to restore proper rhythms to upset stomachs.\n\nNeurogastroenterologist Braden Kuo and neuroscientist Vitaly Napadow, both at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, are taking another approach to the mystery of nausea by investigating motion-induced nausea. With some fancy engineering and a movie projection of fast-moving vertical lines, they built an MRI scanner that simulates a spinning room.\n\nAs volunteers lie inside the machine, the team tracks which areas of their brain grow active as their nausea ratchets up. The participants push a button that records their rating of the nausea\u2019s intensity and allows them to cry \u201cUncle!\u201d before puking. Kuo and Napadow found that nausea activates brain areas involved in pain and fear and areas that deal with emotions and decision-making.\n\nThose last areas might represent a cognitive evaluation of the sensation, Napadow says, \u201cas in 'How long can I take it?' \u201d Also, Kuo says the lit-up brain areas suggest that certain non-narcotic pain medications or antidepressants might help control nausea.\n\nIt\u2019s an important first peek into the brain during nausea, and the MRI setup might help test new drugs.\n\nCharles Horn, a neuroscientist at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, is studying the musk shrew, which, unlike lab rats and mice, does vomit. Horn exposes the shrews to chemotherapy drugs or anesthesia medications that cause severe nausea in humans.\n\nBut since Horn cannot ask the shrews to rate their nausea, he has found others ways to track it. When nauseated, the shrews avoid a saccharin treat associated with the nausea and stop rearing up on their hind legs. It\u2019s a movement akin to curling up on the sofa, he says. By tracking molecular markers in the shrew\u2019s brain, Horn has identified signals that travel from a nauseated shrew\u2019s gut to activate areas in its brain stem and cause vomiting.\n\nSorting out which molecules control that gut-to-brain signaling is the first step in designing new drugs to block them, he says. But such drugs are probably more than a decade away.\n\nMarlena Fejzo, a geneticist at UCLA, is focusing on the role of genetics in HG. She thinks some women may have more trouble than others in breaking down so-called pregnancy hormones (hCG and estrogen) and clearing them from the bloodstream, so that the circulating byproducts become toxic.\n\nFejzo has shown that HG tracks with a woman\u2019s genetics: Having a sister who had HG means that a woman has 17 times more risk of having HG herself.\n\nAlthough vomiting serves to quickly rid the stomach of toxins caused by food poisoning and stomach bugs, Fejzo, Koch and other researchers would like to erase the debilitating nausea and vomiting that apparently serve no good purpose in most other people.\n\n\u201cIf we could understand and treat nausea,\u201d says Koch, \u201cthen there would be no vomiting.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Millions suffer each year from nausea, but little headway to solving it has been made"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c05\"", "article_summary": "Kuo and Napadow found that nausea activates brain areas involved in pain and fear and areas that deal with emotions and decision-making.\n\u201d Also, Kuo says the lit-up brain areas suggest that certain non-narcotic pain medications or antidepressants might help control nausea.\nBy tracking molecular markers in the shrew\u2019s brain, Horn has identified signals that travel from a nauseated shrew\u2019s gut to activate areas in its brain stem and cause vomiting.\nIt\u2019s an important first peek into the brain during nausea, and the MRI setup might help test new drugs.\nAnd, of course, millions are affected every year by the nausea that comes with nasty stomach bugs such as the norovirus."}
