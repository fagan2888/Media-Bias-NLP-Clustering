Elmo \u201cBud\u201d Zumwalt, the newest destroyer\u2019s massive size and angular profile make it stand apart from other U.S. warships. And like its namesake, a reformer who spearheaded changes that helped shape the Navy by offering new opportunities to women and minorities, the Zumwalt will shepherd the fleet into a new era, officials said.\n\n\u201cThis ship is a modern marvel, and it\u2019s going to take smart and creative and hardworking sailors like Bud Zumwalt to operate it,\u201d Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus told the crowd of thousands at Bath Iron Works, where the ship has been under construction since 2009.\n\nMouzetta Zumwalt-Weathers and Ann Zumwalt, the former admiral\u2019s daughters, each christened the ship by smashing a bottle of Champagne near its bow, followed by cheers and bursts of red, white and blue streamers. They were joined at the ceremony by Zumwalt\u2019s son, retired Marine Lt. Col. Jim Zumwalt, who recalled 55 years ago, as a young boy, attending the christening of the USS Dewey, which his father commanded.\n\nBud Zumwalt, who became the youngest chief of naval operations in 1970, promoted the first female and African-American officers to admirals and opened the door for women to become naval aviators and serve on warships.\n\n\u201cHe strove for a Navy that was supportive, encouraging and compassionate toward all sailors, especially minorities and women,\u201d his daughter Ann said. \u201cA Navy that not only fought wars but also fought discrimination in its ranks. He dreamt of a Navy that allowed its sailors a better quality of life.\u201d\n\nAmong the 15,000-ton warship\u2019s cutting-edge features are a composite deckhouse with hidden radar and sensors and an angular shape that officials say will allow it to be confused for a small fishing boat on radars. It also sports wave-piercing hull designed to reduce the ship\u2019s wake. It\u2019s the first U.S. ship to use electric propulsion and produces enough power to one day support the futuristic electromagnetic rail gun, which will be tested at sea in 2016.\n\nInside, sailors will have more space to work and live because the Zumwalt will only require about half the crew of the current generation of destroyers. Meanwhile, fewer sailors will need to stand watch because of cameras and video monitors that show what\u2019s going on outside.\n\nThat will allow the Navy to \u201ccarry out its crucial mission at a time of budget constraints,\u201d said Maine U.S. Sen. Susan Collins.\n\nThe Zumwalt was originally supposed to be christened in October, but the ceremony was rescheduled because of the federal government shutdown. The ship is expected to be delivered to the Navy late this year and to enter service in 2016. It will be joined by two other destroyers in its class, which are also being built in Bath.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. Navy on Saturday christened the first ship of its newest class of destroyers, a more than $3 billion, 610-foot-long warship sporting advanced technology and a stealthy shape designed to minimize its visibility on enemy radar and reduce the size of its crew.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The U.S. Navy on Saturday christened the first ship of its newest class of destroyers, a more than $3 billion, 610-foot-long warship sporting advanced technology and a stealthy shape designed to minimize its visibility on enemy radar and reduce the size of its crew.", "title": "\u2018Modern marvel\u2019: New U.S. Navy destroyer Zumwalt christened in Maine", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/12/navys-new-destroyer-to-be-christened-in-maine/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/11/939f83973a85070e510f6a706700d5d9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/04/11/939f83973a85070e510f6a706700d5d9.jpg", "description": "The U.S. Navy on Saturday christened the first ship of its newest class of destroyers, a more than $3 billion, 610-foot-long warship sporting advanced technology and a stealthy shape designed to minim", "card": "summary", "title": "\u2018Modern marvel\u2019: New U.S. Navy destroyer Zumwalt christene"}, "Author": "Alanna Durkin", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Navy, Bath, Elmo  Bud  Zumwalt, Navy Ray Mabus"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c53\"", "article_summary": "The Zumwalt was originally supposed to be christened in October, but the ceremony was rescheduled because of the federal government shutdown.\nThe ship is expected to be delivered to the Navy late this year and to enter service in 2016.\nNamed after the late Adm.
