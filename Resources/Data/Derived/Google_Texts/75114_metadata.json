At that time, shortly before the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, Americans were about as critical of government as they are today. Just 22% said they could trust the government almost always or most of the time; 26% expressed that view in January of this year.\n\nYet in that 2010 survey, clear majorities expressed favorable opinions of many of the government departments and agencies tested. Only one \u2013 the Department of Education \u2013 was viewed more unfavorably than favorably.\n\nAs the 2010 report on opinions about government noted, favorable ratings for several departments had declined since the late 1990s. The most striking shift was in views of the education department: In 1997, 61% had a favorable impression of the Department of Education, but that fell to 40% in 2010.\n\nHowever, favorable ratings for Congress continue to be far lower than for any of the federal departments or agencies tested in the 2010 survey. In July of this year, just 21% had a favorable impression of Congress, while 70% viewed the institution unfavorably \u2013 among the most negative measures in nearly three decades of polling.\n\nTopics: Federal Government", "article_metadata": {"description": "The public has long expressed a more negative opinion of \u201cthe government\u201d than of the departments and agencies that actually carry out the work of government.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5", "og": {"url": "http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/10/03/most-federal-agencies-viewed-positively-despite-frustration-and-anger-with-government/", "site_name": "Pew Research Center", "type": "article", "description": "The public has long expressed a more negative opinion of \u201cthe government\u201d than of the departments and agencies that actually carry out the work of government.", "title": "Most federal agencies viewed positively, despite frustration and anger with government"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/10/03/most-federal-agencies-viewed-positively-despite-frustration-and-anger-with-government/", "site": "@pewresearch", "description": "The public has long expressed a more negative opinion of \u201cthe government\u201d than of the departments and agencies that actually carry out the work of government.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Most federal agencies viewed positively, despite frustration and anger with government"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"project\": \"U.S. Politics\"}", "theme-color": "#231f20", "projects": "U.S. Politics", "date": 20131003, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pewresearch", "published_time": "2013-10-03T13:16:08+00:00"}, "topics": "Federal Government", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Yet in that 2010 survey, clear majorities expressed favorable opinions of many of the government departments and agencies tested.\nHowever, favorable ratings for Congress continue to be far lower than for any of the federal departments or agencies tested in the 2010 survey.\nAs the government shutdown enters its third day, anger at the federal government is as high as it has been in many years.\nOnly one \u2013 the Department of Education \u2013 was viewed more unfavorably than favorably.\nBut the public has long expressed a more negative opinion of \u201cthe government\u201d than of the departments and agencies that actually carry out the work of government."}
