We\u2019re not getting rid of anything,\u201d Brickley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a fair amount more event space (at the new location) than what we do here, so we\u2019ll definitely be able to more conveniently run some board game and card game tournaments.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Den", "description": "Beloved costume/game/general geek castle The Wizard\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds Chest has told customers in an email newsletter that it will move to a new location later this year.", "title": "The Wizard's Chest's new location will be on Broadway", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/theden/2015/04/23/the-wizards-chests-new-location-will-be-on-broadway/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/theden/files/2015/04/1609135-495x324.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Beloved costume/game/general geek castle The Wizard\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds Chest has told customers in an email newsletter that it will move to a new location later this year.", "creator": "@daveburdick", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/theden/2015/04/23/the-wizards-chests-new-location-will-be-on-broadway/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/theden/files/2015/04/1609135-495x324.jpg", "title": "The Wizard\u2019s Chest\u2019s new location will be on Broadway", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "news_keywords": "games,wizard's chest", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Beloved costume/game/general geek castle The Wizard\u2019s Chest has told customers in an email newsletter that it will move to a new location later this year."}, "article_summary": "The Cherry Creek location, immediately recognizable by its fantastical castle features against the sleek, upscale backdrop of Cherry Creek North, opened in 1982.\nBrickley said that space was the motivating factor, not rent, but that the rent per square foot is sufficiently different that the rent at the Cherry Creek North location and the new Broadway location will be similar.\nBeloved costume /game/general geek castle The Wizard\u2019s Chest has told customers on Facebook and in an email newsletter that it will open a new location in September at 451 Broadway , next to Meininger Art Materials.\n\u201cBut then once October is over, in November, we\u2019ll move more and more of our products over.\u201dThe current location at 230 Fillmore in Cherry Creek will close in January 2016.\nThe new location moves The Wizard\u2019s Chest from a building with an overall square footage of about 8,500 to a building with about 18,000 square feet, some 12,000 of which will be retail space, Brickley said."}
