Brawley-based Clinicas de Salud del Pueblo will receive almost $700,000 for a new clinic in the Coachella Valley.

Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell announced about $101 million in Affordable Care Act funding earlier this week for 164 new health center sites in 33 states. Of the 23 clinics in California, Clinicas de Salud was the only Imperial Valley-based program to receive funding, a total of $691,667 for the local nonprofit.

“The Affordable Care Act has led to unprecedented increases in access to health insurance. Part of building on that progress is connecting people to the care they need,” said Burwell said in a statement. “Health centers are keystones of the communities they serve.

“Today’s awards will enable more individuals and families to have access to the affordable, quality health care that health centers provide,” she added. “That includes the preventive and primary care services that will keep them healthy.”

In total, the 164 nationwide new health centers are projected to increase access to health care services for nearly 650,000 patients, according to a press release from the Health and Human Services Department.

The new Hemet clinic will include medical and dental service and target the low-income, homeless and seasonal farmworker population of central Hemet. The area has seen a 39 percent increase in population since 2000, most of that growth attributed to migrants from Mexico that work low-wage jobs in agriculture and tourism, according to information from Clinicas de Salud.

Rep. Juan Vargas announced the local award in a press statement on Tuesday.

“I was very pleased that Clinicas de Salud del Pueblo will receive this funding to continue providing comprehensive primary care services to residents throughout Imperial County,” said Vargas. “This award recognizes the positive impact of their work in the Imperial Valley and will enable them to continue their mission to serve countless families and individuals.”
