It\u2019s much more like a Calder mobile which he called a kinetic sculpture. If you touch something over here, things jiggle all the way over here. It\u2019s very hard to change this piecemeal and I think that\u2019s about what they\u2019re about to find out. And this is why you can probably only have this created by a president who had never run anything larger than a Senate office. And that is why we generally prefer governors as presidents. They have at least run something.\u201d\n\nPowers had a different reaction to the White House\u2019s explanations for the less-than-desirable rollout of Obamacare. She explained how she had been personally affected by the law and said the explanation from Obama and his press secretary Jay Carney is not based in truth. Powers said customers like her are seeing their premiums increase in order to subsidize others.\n\n\u201cMy blood pressure goes up every time they say that they\u2019re protecting us from substandard health insurance plans because there is nothing to support what they\u2019re saying,\u201d Powers said. \u201cI have talked about how I am losing my health insurance. If I want to keep the same health insurance, it\u2019s going to cost twice is as much. There\u2019s nothing substandard about my plan. All of the things they say that are not in my plan are in my plan. All of the things they have listed \u2014 there\u2019s no explanation for the doubling of my premiums other than the fact it\u2019s subsidizing other people.\n\n\u201cThey need to be honest about that \u2014 that that\u2019s the reason they don\u2019t want to change it,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re basically taking the people who are responsible enough to get health insurance in the individual market and asking them to subsidize other people. So they\u2019re taking young healthy people and asking them to subsidize other people. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to last, frankly. I think they\u2019re trying to buy time until they think they\u2019re going to reach this next deadline. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to reach it and when they don\u2019t reach it \u2026 I think there is going to be an absolute \u2014 now, not just senators who are up for reelection, you know, calling for this to be fixed \u2014 so, I think they\u2019re going to have to respond to that.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Poor", "description": "'Special Report' panelists discuss the fallout from White House's unpopular Obamacare launch", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Left-leaning Daily Beast columnist Kirsten Powers, who recently revealed how she lost her health coverage under Obamacare, slammed the Obama administration's efforts to deal with the metastasizing Aff", "title": "Kirsten Powers slams White House Obamacare excuses: \u2018My blood pressure goes up\u2019", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/12/kirsten-powers-slams-white-house-obamacare-excuses-my-blood-pressure-goes-up/", "image": {"width": 649, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SR1112-e1384311892559.jpg", "height": 279}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Special Report' panelists discuss the fallout from White House's unpopular Obamacare launch", "title": "Kirsten Powers slams White House Obamacare excuses: \u2018My blood pressure goes up\u2019 Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/12/kirsten-powers-slams-white-house-obamacare-excuses-my-blood-pressure-goes-up/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SR1112-e1384311892559.jpg"}, "creator": "@jeff_poor", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-12 23:08:17", "sailthru.title": "Kirsten Powers slams White House Obamacare excuses: 'My blood pressure goes up'", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "george-will,kirsten-powers,obamacare,jeff-poor", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "george will,kirsten powers,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "Left-leaning Daily Beast columnist Kirsten Powers, who recently revealed how she lost her health coverage under Obamacare, slammed the Obama administration's efforts to deal with the metastasizing Aff", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SR1112-e1384311892559.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4472\"", "article_summary": "I think they\u2019re trying to buy time until they think they\u2019re going to reach this next deadline.\n\u201cMy blood pressure goes up every time they say that they\u2019re protecting us from substandard health insurance plans because there is nothing to support what they\u2019re saying,\u201d Powers said.\nI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to last, frankly.\nIf I want to keep the same health insurance, it\u2019s going to cost twice is as much.\nIt\u2019s very hard to change this piecemeal and I think that\u2019s about what they\u2019re about to find out."}
