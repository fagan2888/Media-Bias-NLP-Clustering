His yardage total (which also included 67 passing yards) topped his next nearest teammate by more than 300 yards as receiver Daquon Green rushed for 20 yards and caught a 16-yard pass in the win.\n\nCain admitted to a little chip on his shoulder against Durant, not just for the Week 2 loss TBT suffered to the Cougars this season, but dating to his sophomore year when the Titans\u2019 season came to a close in the same round with a 34-7 loss at Ron Frost Field.\n\nBut on Friday, Cain\u2019s celebration was short-lived. In the postgame circle, the senior and Clemson commit addressed his team saying, \u201cThis win is over, now we get to work again.\u201d\n\nThe Titans take on Sickles next week, another team that defeated TBT (21-14) and held Cain in check (103 yards passing and 52 rushing).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s Sickles,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cJust like we were happy to have a second opportunity at Durant, we\u2019ll be fired up for our second opportunity against Sickles.\u201d\n\nMcCloud moves to top of county\u2019s rushing list\n\nIt took four years and a playoff game on Friday night, but Sickles running back Ray Ray McCloud III finally passed all the great Hillsborough County running backs before him, including Carrollwood Day\u2019s Robert Davis, Riverview\u2019s Avious Steadman, Gaither\u2019s Lydell Ross, Armwood\u2019s Kalvin Bailey and \u2026\n\nWithout question, there is no one left for McCloud to pass.\n\nMcCloud clinched the top spot after rushing 31 times for 141 yards in a 9-7 victory over Plant City. The effort gave him 5,579 career rushing yards, just three ahead of the mark set in 2012 by Davis.\n\nBrooks questionable\n\nPlant starting running back Patrick Brooks sprained his achilles tendon in the second quarter and didn\u2019t return during the Panthers\u2019 29-7 victory over Orlando Boone.\n\nBrooks, who rushed for 1,293 yards in the regular season, will be assessed on a daily basis and may still play in Friday\u2019s second-round Class 8A playoff game against Dr. Phillips, Plant coach Robert Weiner said.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t tear (the tendon) but he was wearing a (protective boot) Friday night,\u201d Weiner said. \u201cIf he plays or notw depends on how he recovers the next few days.\u201d\n\nTop performers\n\nSpoto\u2019s Kevin Hobley and Todd Sims \u2014 Hobley threw two touchdown passes and Sims rushed for three in the Spartans\u2019 42-6 blowout of Lake Wales, the first playoff victory in Spoto\u2019s football history.\n\nTampa Bay Tech\u2019s Deon Cain \u2014 Cain\u2019s performance from Friday night\u2019s 42-25 victory over Durant is worth repeating: 26 carries, 352 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nArmwood\u2019s defense \u2014 The Hawks shut out Largo, 38-0, giving them eight shutouts on the season. Armwood also has allowed only three points in their last eight games and 23 total for the season.\n\nJesuit quarterback Trent Wessel \u2014 The senior rushed for three touchdowns and passed for another in the Tigers\u2019 35-28 victory over Auburndale.\n\nPlant quarterback Rex Culpepper \u2014 The junior rushed for a touchdown and threw two more in the Panthers\u2019 29-7 victory over Orlando Boone.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 15 Nov 2014 21:18:46 -0400", "Description": "Coaches love to talk about big time players shining in the biggest moments, so it was no wonder that Tampa Bay Tech coach Jayson Roberts couldn\u2019t wipe the smile from his face as he talked abou", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "Coaches love to talk about big time players shining in the biggest moments, so it was no wonder that Tampa Bay Tech coach Jayson Roberts couldn\u2019t wipe the smile from his face as he talked abou", "title": "Titans\u2019 Cain comes up big", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/sports/preps/titans-cain-comes-up-big-20141115/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141115/ARTICLE/141119386/AR/0/AR-141119386.jpg", "height": 2441}, "updated_time": "2014-11-15T21:18:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "Coaches love to talk about big time players shining in the biggest moments, so it was no wonder that Tampa Bay Tech coach Jayson Roberts couldn\u2019t wipe the smile from his face as he talked ab", "title": "Titans\u2019 Cain comes up big", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20141115/ARTICLE/141119386/AR/0/AR-141119386.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "googlebot-news": "noindex", "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-11-15T21:18:46Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-11-15T21:18:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The effort gave him 5,579 career rushing yards, just three ahead of the mark set in 2012 by Davis.\n\u201cI had a feeling he was going to have a big night,\u201d Roberts said of Cain.\nJesuit quarterback Trent Wessel \u2014 The senior rushed for three touchdowns and passed for another in the Tigers\u2019 35-28 victory over Auburndale.\nTampa Bay Tech\u2019s Deon Cain \u2014 Cain\u2019s performance from Friday night\u2019s 42-25 victory over Durant is worth repeating: 26 carries, 352 yards and five touchdowns.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think they were going to be prepared for what we were going to do with him.\u201dOn top of Friday\u2019s touchdown rushes of 50, 3, 45, 48 and 50 yards, Cain had nine rushes for first downs."}
