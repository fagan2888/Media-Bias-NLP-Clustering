But some insurers are still charging certain patients more by passing the extra costs on in the form of higher drug prices.\n\nRelated: Get Ready for a Surge in Costly Drug Prices\n\nBy structuring their health plans a certain way, patient advocates say insurers are discriminating against some patients by forcing them to pay the highest tier drug costs for certain prescriptions\u2014or by discouraging them from signing up from the plans, leaving insurers with only healthy patients.\n\nIn Florida, for example, four insurers \u2013 Cigna, CoventryOne, Humana and Preferred Medical \u2013 have been accused of discriminating against people with HIV/AIDS. A recent complaint filed with the Health and Human Services Department alleges that the insurers placed all covered HIV/AIDS prescriptions in the highest drug tiers requiring patients to pay significant out of pocket costs---sometimes an upwards of $1,000 each month.\n\n\u201cBy placing all HIV/AIDS medications, including generics, on the highest cost-sharing tier, CoventryOne, Cigna, Humana, and Preferred Medical discourage people living with HIV and AIDS from enrolling in the health plan \u2013 a practice which unlawfully discriminates on the basis of disability,\u201d the complaint says.\n\nThe complaint says CoventryOne, Cigna, and Preferred Medical\u2014require patients to cover 40 percent of the medication costs out of pocket, and Humana requires patients to cover 50 percent out of pocket. Meanwhile the groups point to insurers like Florida Blue, which offers plans that place the same drugs on lower tiers with co-pays costing between of $10 to $70 based on whether its tier 1 or 2 medication.\n\nRelated: Obama Administration to Drop Medicare Drug Changes\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re passing the cost along through drug prices, and it\u2019s hard for the patients to know what the costs will equate to. There\u2019s no transparency,\u201d said Carl Schmid, deputy executive director of the AIDS Institute, which along with the National Health Law Program, filed the complaint.\n\nAlthough insurers are allowed to set their own cost-sharing levels, the new law strictly prohibits them from discouraging people with specific health conditions or creating plans that target certain patients.\n\nRepresentatives from the accused insurers, for their part, maintain that their prices are in line with industry standards.\n\nKaren Eldred, a spokeswoman for Cigna, told The New York Times that \u201cthe company, like many other insurers, offers an array of plans in the federal marketplaces, including some that offer more comprehensive coverage.\u201d\n\nAnd as the National Journal\u2019s Sophie Novack notes, insurers are charging higher prices for specialty drugs\u2014since they are, for the first time ever, required to cover more expensive individuals with pre-existing conditions. The problem is, as patient advocates point out, it\u2019s not just specialty drugs that have become so costly\u2014it\u2019s generics as well.\n\nSchmid said that discrimination isn\u2019t happening exclusively among HIV/AIDS patients, adding that similar practices are affecting other groups with serious illnesses like cancer patients. He added that although his group is based in Florida, where the complaint is filed, there are likely similar situations happening around the country.\n\nRelated: Why Obamacare As We Know It May Not Survive\n\nAn analysis released in June by Avalere Health (and commissioned by PhRMA) found that the majority of plans sold on the health exchanges placed a significant out of pocket burden on patients with serious illnesses like cancer by requiring high cost-sharing for all medicines used to treat certain conditions. The report found that in seven of 19 classes of medicines for serious illnesses, such as cancer and HIV/AIDS, more than 20 percent of Silver plans\u2014the standard plan on the exchanges-- require patients to pay 40 percent or more out of pocket costs.\n\nSimilarly, in 10 of the 19 selected classes, at least 20 percent of Silver plans require coinsurance of 30 percent or greater for drugs in the classes.\n\nThe study also finds that more than 60 percent of Silver plans place all covered medications for multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn\u2019s disease and certain cancers in the plan\u2019s highest formulary tier.\n\n\u201cThe Exchanges were meant to provide patients access to the medicines they need, especially for the sickest among us. Yet this report paints a very different picture, one in which many Americans still find themselves unable to access the care they desperately need due to high out of pocket costs,\u201d John J. Castellani, President and CEO of PhRMA, said in a statement.\n\nRelated: Court Challenges to Subsidies Threaten Obamacare\n\nAnother issue is transparency. Schmid said right now, it\u2019s difficult to find out if drugs are covered under certain plans. \u201cWe had an awful time figuring out which drugs were being offered on the plans as well as what the costs of the drugs were.\u201d\n\nThe groups say they want their complaint to prompt HHS to more closely scrutinize all insurers plans submitted for next year.\n\nInsurers have already been submitting their plans for next year, though they won\u2019t be finalized until the fall. \u201cWe want it to influence the review of the 2015 plans,\u201d Schmid said. \u201cWe hope there will be greater scrutiny when these plans come in about how insurers designed their plans.\u201d\n\nThe Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight has also indicated that it will perform an analysis on patient cost sharing before plans are finalized for next year.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Some insurance companies are finding ways to get around one of Obamacare\u2019s most popula", "title": "Obamacare Insurers Hit High-Cost Patients with High Drug Prices", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/10/Obamacare-Insurers-Hit-High-Cost-Patients-High-Drug-Prices", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/pill_drone_flickr_Javorac.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/10/Obamacare-Insurers-Hit-High-Cost-Patients-High-Drug-Prices", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/pill_drone_flickr_Javorac.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Some insurance companies are finding ways to get around one of Obamacare\u2019s most popula", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "But some insurers are still charging certain patients more by passing the extra costs on in the form of higher drug prices.\nSchmid said that discrimination isn\u2019t happening exclusively among HIV/AIDS patients, adding that similar practices are affecting other groups with serious illnesses like cancer patients.\nSchmid said right now, it\u2019s difficult to find out if drugs are covered under certain plans.\nRelated: Obama Administration to Drop Medicare Drug Changes\u201cThey\u2019re passing the cost along through drug prices, and it\u2019s hard for the patients to know what the costs will equate to.\nIn Florida, for example, four insurers \u2013 Cigna, CoventryOne, Humana and Preferred Medical \u2013 have been accused of discriminating against people with HIV/AIDS."}
