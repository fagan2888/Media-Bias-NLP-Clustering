Multiple trips to Goldman Sachs. Morgan Stanley. Deutsche Bank. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. UBS Wealth Management.\u201d\n\nIn other words when the next recession hits, expect Clinton to show Wall Street the same preferential treatment it received from George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cBig Pharma and health-care companies also make the list; they want to keep on the good side of the woman who tried to force HillaryCare down our throats in 1993 and who\u2019s sure to morph ObamaCare into the \u2018single-payer\u2019 socialized-medicine model so beloved of \u2018progressives,'\u201d Walsh added.\n\nIndeed. If the Sanders revolution has proved anything, it\u2019s that Clinton is going to have to run a lot further to the left than she originally anticipated.\n\nWant the full list of Clinton\u2019s paymasters?
