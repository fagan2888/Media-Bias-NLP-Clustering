Lou Barletta (R-Penn.) claimed that the House could \"probably\" impeach Obama if the matter was brought to the floor.\n\n\"You know, the problem is, you know, what do you do for those that say, 'Impeach him for breaking the laws or bypassing the laws'?\" Barletta said in a June 16 interview. \"You know, could that pass in the House? It probably could. Is the majority of the American people in favor of impeaching the president? I'm not sure.\"\n\n\n\nAlso on HuffPost: The Second-Term Curse The Second-Term Curse\n\n1 of 9 President Barack Obama Obama's second-term agenda had to take a backseat after several scandals caught the media's attention in May.
