But all indications are the savings target for reconciliation won\u2019t come close to the trillions needed to reach balance by 2025.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPart of this is practical politics given President Barack Obama\u2019s veto. But in a surprising twist, a lot also has to do with new, lower cost estimates for the law the GOP loves to hate: the Affordable Care Act.\n\nJust this past Monday, the Congressional Budget Office trimmed $209 billion from its prior January estimate for the 10-year cost of subsidies and related spending and revenues for the health exchanges. That\u2019s a 20 percent drop in the space of two months, and those are the same exchange subsidies threatened by a Republican-backed lawsuit before the Supreme Court.\n\nIf the justices were to strike down the subsidies this summer, Republicans would be under pressure to come up with some relief for the millions who would find it harder to keep their health coverage.\n\nThe filibuster-proof reconciliation process is one legislative tool to employ. The budget resolution is expected to lay the groundwork by instructing relevant committees to come up with savings from other benefit programs. But the reporting date will be late enough so that the impact of the court decision can be addressed.\n\nCBO\u2019s new scores are relevant here in setting the deficit reduction target. Since the exchange subsidies are said to be costing that much less, it means a narrower window for the GOP if the party is to use reconciliation to both respond to the healthcare crisis and achieve budget savings.\n\nHaving a lower deficit reduction target makes this more doable. And as a rule, the lower the target, the more room for the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees to add healthcare provisions to the package.\n\nIndeed, in the Senate at least, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is telling his members that one big reason to vote for the budget resolution is to give Republicans an outlet for dealing with the aftermath of the court decision.\n\nMcConnell couples this with a message to play it safe. As briefings began this week with individual members, it appears a decision has been made to keep Medicare spending in the resolution close to what President Barack Obama has proposed, for example. And while the Senate budget is expected to have a reserve fund for potential defense increases in the future, the current appropriations caps are left intact\u2014without big new cuts in discretionary spending for domestic programs.\n\nThe down side of this strategy is that too small a reconciliation package also invites ridicule.\n\nThe Senate Budget panel heard testimony Wednesday that it would take $5.5 trillion in deficit reduction to get to balance by 2025. Without big savings from entitlements to fill this gap, the balanced budget plan can seem more bluster than bite.\n\nRight now, that\u2019s a risk many in the GOP seem willing to take. McConnell and Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) are both veterans of the 1990s and the Republican battles then with another Democratic president, Bill Clinton.\n\nCertainly, the GOP paid a political price in 1995 when it sought to enact major savings at the expense of Medicare and other domestic programs\u2014only to run into a veto fight with Clinton and a damaging government shutdown. In fact, all three vetoes of reconciliation bills were in that period of Republican dominance in Congress and the Clinton in the White House.\n\nReconciliation gets its name from a time long ago when Congress actually passed two budget resolutions each year: one setting goals, the second more binding.\n\nIn this context, reconciliation was a tool to \u201creconcile\u201d the two by making the necessary spending and tax changes needed to meet deficit targets. It gives considerable leeway to the two budget committees to manage a two-step process: first assigning targets to individual authorizing committees and then assembling each committee\u2019s piece into a single package that is subject to limited debate.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, it was an effective budget tool used by presidents of both parties. But in the years since, each party has accused the other of abusing the process as a way to advance their agenda \u2013not true deficit reduction.\n\nMcConnell bitterly complained that Democrats overstepped by using reconciliation in 2010 to complete healthcare reform. Now he and the Senate GOP are preparing to use it themselves if needed\u2014 depending on how the justices rule.\n\nUntil the court makes its decision, the full impact of the GOP strategy will not be clear. But it could end up confronting Obama and Democrats with a set of Hobson choices next fall if the ACA subsidy structure is struck down.\n\nFor example, right now the Senate is working with a late July date for committees to report back with savings under reconciliation. Medicaid and food stamps for the poor are likely targets even if Medicare is largely spared. The president\u2019s first instinct might be to veto the package, but if the same reconciliation bill offers some relief for those who have lost their health coverage, the White House and Democrats would have to take that into account as well.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The savings target for budget reconciliation likely won\u2019t come close to the trillions needed to reach balance by 2025.", "title": "Hill Republicans playing it safe on deficit reduction", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/hill-republicans-playing-it-safe-on-deficit-reduction-116037.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/03/12/150312_mcconnell_boehner_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Senate,Republicans,Democrats,House Of Representatives,Federal Budget,Budget", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The savings target for budget reconciliation likely won\u2019t come close to the trillions needed to reach balance by 2025.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ba2\"", "article_summary": "Hill Republicans playing it safe on deficit reductionFor all the bold talk of balancing the budget, Republicans in Congress are playing it safe on how much deficit reduction can be accomplished this year under the expedited reconciliation process afforded to the majority.\nThe Senate Budget panel heard testimony Wednesday that it would take $5.5 trillion in deficit reduction to get to balance by 2025.\nNow he and the Senate GOP are preparing to use it themselves if needed\u2014 depending on how the justices rule.\nThe House and Senate Budget Committees won\u2019t roll out their tax and spending plans until next week.\nBut all indications are the savings target for reconciliation won\u2019t come close to the trillions needed to reach balance by 2025."}
