You need transparency if you have people going into the administration,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough the center has begun to reveal more about its funding, it\u2019s still impossible to tell whether donors include those seeking to influence health policy.\n\nDoctors for America declined to provide a list of its donors in response a request by The Washington Times. The group says it raises its own money, though donors are told on the website disclosure that the contributions are tax-deductible because Doctors is a project of the Center for American Progress.\n\nWith the Center for American Progress acting as its fiscal sponsor, the physicians organization said it doesn\u2019t take direction from the think tank and conducts its own fundraising.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of our funding comes from individual donors and foundations,\u201d said Brannon Jordan, a spokeswoman for the organization. \u201cIn fact, in 2013, over 95 percent of our funds came from 501(c)(3) foundation grants and individual donations.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the surgeon general\u2019s office, declined to comment on whether ethics officials had reviewed the nonprofit funding sources to vet any potential conflicts of interest.\n\nFormer Obama Medicare chief Donald Berwick faced similar questions during his confirmation battle. He ran a nonprofit think tank, but he declined to release information about its donors in response to requests from Republicans who questioned whether he could have a conflict of interest.\n\nDr. Murthy\u2019s work with Doctors for America is likely to surface as an area of inquiry as lawmakers vet his nomination, according to a Senate aide who was not authorized to discuss the nomination publicly because it is pending.\n\n\u201cFor example, both Doctors for America and the Center for American Progress benefit from favorable tax status under federal law as an allegedly nonpartisan nonprofit,\u201d the aide said. \u201cYet this arrangement raises legitimate questions about Murthy\u2019s role with Doctors for America, its donors, and possibly inappropriate coordination with the White House and HHS officials.\u201d\n\nAs surgeon general, Dr. Murthy would become the nation\u2019s most recognizable doctor, overseeing 6,700 public health care professionals and 200,000 volunteers.\n\nDr. Murthy has pledged to recuse himself from any specific matters involving the Center for American Progress for a year after his resignation from Doctors for America, according to ethics forms he signed last month.\n\nA big supporter of Obamacare, he is the latest nominee with ties to the Center for American Progress to join the Obama administration.\n\nThe organization\u2019s founder, John Podesta, is taking a job as counselor to Mr. Obama. Other alumni include Brian Deese, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Denis McDonough, White House chief of staff.\n\nAfter mounting scrutiny, the Center for American Progress recently disclosed a list of more than 50 corporate funding sources, including several with health care interests. It\u2019s unclear based on the list whether those funders donated to the center or to Doctors for American or both.\n\nThe corporate donors include Quest Diagnostics, Health Care Service Corp., Eli Lilly and Co., and CVS Caremark, all of which lobby HHS.\n\nThe White House made no mention of Dr. Murthy\u2019s ties to the Center for American Progress in announcing his nomination in November. It described him first and foremost as co-founder and president of Doctors for America, even though his financial disclosure forms list no income from that position.\n\nSince last year, Dr. Murthy reported earning $173,900 in salary from the Brigham and Women\u2019s Physician Organization in Boston and $220,000 from privately held Epernicus LLC, a software firm he helped found now known as TrialNetworks.\n\nAn early backer of Obamacare, he appeared at a White House event in 2009 along with other doctors to tout Mr. Obama\u2019s health care initiative. He also hasn\u2019t been shy about wading into other contentious debates.\n\nLast fall, as lawmakers debated gun control legislation, Dr. Murthy shared his thoughts on Twitter: \u201cTired of politicians playing politics w/ guns b/c they\u2019re scared of NRA. Guns are a health care issue.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The White House has trumpeted President Obama's surgeon general nominee as president of a grass-roots doctors group, but Doctors for America, founded by Dr. Vivek Murthy, is actually a well-connected liberal-leaning operation.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The White House has trumpeted President Obama\u2019s surgeon general nominee as president of a grass-roots doctors group, but Doctors for America, founded by Dr. Vivek Murthy, is actually a well-connected liberal-leaning operation.", "title": "Obama\u2019s surgeon general nominee connected to left-leaning think tank", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/dec/23/obamas-surgeon-general-nominee-connected-to-left-l/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/23/12232013_doctor8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/12/23/12232013_doctor8201.jpg", "description": "The White House has trumpeted President Obama's surgeon general nominee as president of a grass-roots doctors group, but Doctors for America, founded by Dr. Vivek Murthy, is actually a well-connected", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama\u2019s surgeon general nominee connected to left-leaning think"}, "Author": "Jim McElhatton", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Health Medical Pharma, Vivek Murthy, Center For American Progress, White House"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc8ee\"", "article_summary": "A big supporter of Obamacare, he is the latest nominee with ties to the Center for American Progress to join the Obama administration.\nWith the Center for American Progress acting as its fiscal sponsor, the physicians organization said it doesn\u2019t take direction from the think tank and conducts its own fundraising.\nMs. McGehee said that\u2019s true for the Center for American Progress more broadly because the think tank has become a \u201cholding place for policy experts in waiting\u201d to join the administration.\nThe White House has trumpeted President Obama\u2019s surgeon general nominee as president of a grass-roots doctors group, but Doctors for America, founded by Dr. Vivek Murthy, is actually a well-connected liberal-leaning operation.\nThe White House made no mention of Dr. Murthy\u2019s ties to the Center for American Progress in announcing his nomination in November."}
