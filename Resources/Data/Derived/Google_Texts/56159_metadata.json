Tristan Stetson took second at 120. Eli August (160) and Jacob Lowe (113) came in third, and Zach Judan (126) and Scott Rathbun (132) came in fourth.\n\nThe day included five fall-from-ahead losses for the still-lots-to-learn Blackbirds.\n\n\u201cWith being a young team,\u201d Keene assistant Nick Wheelock said, \u201ca lot of our kids lack the composure, discipline and mental awareness to have effective match management in close and intense contests.\u201d\n\nBut, they\u2019re getting there.\n\nWatson, a lanky 138-pounder who likes to play music in addition to studying physics, took up wrestling without really knowing why. His older brother, Dan, wrestled at Keene, so he joined too.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t even sure why I was wrestling the first year or two,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI was just doing it.\u201d\n\nWatson finished third at the jayvee state tournament, \u201cbut I should have won it,\u201d he said, noting he was older than most. He added a fourth in the Bow tournament, \u201cbut it\u2019s not a big tournament.\u201d\n\nThe tumblers, though, eventually clicked into place.\n\n\u201cAfter my sophomore year, I realized I hadn\u2019t improved much since my first year,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI knew I could do better. I wanted more. I started working out, lifting weights, preparing myself.\u201d\n\nKeene assistant Nick Wheelock, who won a state title as a senior at Goffstown, said Watson has the overall technique to compete at the state level.\n\n\u201cQuinn can do it,\u201d Wheelock said. \u201cHe\u2019s got the basic abilities. He knows the techniques. He just needs to work on his composure and fitness, and that\u2019ll come with the more he competes.\u201d\n\nWatson took the lead into the final 30 seconds of an early match against Winnacunnet\u2019s Kyle Bolduc, but got in a bind and got pinned.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so frustrating,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI know I can do it, but I have to keep working.\u201d\n\nStetson, one of Keene\u2019s co-captains, is certain Watson will figure it out \u2014 just like physicists Galileo, Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein figured out astronomy, gravity and relativity.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s wicked smart,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s taking advanced placement classes (in several subjects), and he\u2019s a good wrestler.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a young team. Quinn\u2019s one of the older guys now and he\u2019s getting his chance.\u201d\n\nIn other years, Watson always seemed to be a step behind teammates at the same weight, limiting his varsity mat time. He\u2019s also been sidelined with skin issues like ringworm.\n\nWatson said the wrestling mats and in-close nature of the sport irritate the condition, which he combats with medicine and creams.\n\nThis season, though, the future theoretical physicist predicts success. Maybe not a state title, and maybe not even a winning record. But, at the very least, an all-out effort, and that\u2019s a winning formula.\n\nNotes\n\nThe tournament featured 13 teams competing on three mats at the Conval gym. ...
