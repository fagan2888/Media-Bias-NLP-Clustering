But freestanding centers don\u2019t treat as many of those patients as hospitals, so patients with less severe emergencies can get more immediate assistance.\n\nSince 1990, the number of hospital-based emergency departments has declined by 27 percent, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2011. Meanwhile, the number of visits to hospital EDs has been on the rise, increasing 30 percent \u2014 to 123 million \u2014 between 1998 and 2008 alone, the study found.\n\nThe use of hospital EDs is growing faster than the use of any other part of the U.S. medical system, according to the American Hospital Association, and EDs are now responsible for about half of all hospital admissions in the United States.\n\nIn Butler County, Cincinnati-based TriHealth opened a $3 million emergency department in February 2013 on the Bethesda Butler Hospital campus on Hamilton-Mason Road in Hamilton after purchasing the former Butler County Medical Center in 2012.\n\nThe new ED has 17 patient bays within about 11,000 square feet.\n\nThe Mercy Health network in June 2013 expanded its emergency department at Fairfield Hospital to include an extra six patient bays. The hospital spent about $400,000 on the expansion for a total of 38 patient bays in the ED, which recorded over 61,000 visits in 2012.\n\nIn Hamilton, the Kettering-owned Fort Hamilton Hospital underwent $5 million in construction to expand its emergency department to 35 patient beds.\n\nThe project was ongoing from August 2012 until completion in January 2014.\n\nThe Hamilton hospital has averaged about 40,000 annual visits to its ED in the past three years, but now has the capacity for as many as 60,000 patients per year, said Dr. Marcus Romanello, chief medical officer at Fort Hamilton Hospital.\n\nButler County\u2019s youngest hospital, West Chester Hospital, hasn\u2019t had the need yet to update its emergency services because it\u2019s still modern in its design and technology, said spokeswoman Debra Titlebaum.\n\nHowever, she said the hospital\u2019s patient volumes and breadth of services in the ED have been on the rise.\n\nThere\u2019s been a 20 percent increase in patient volumes in the past two years, with over 37,000 patients treated in the ED last year. Titlebaum said the hospital can also handle more complex cases after earning provisional status as a Level III Trauma Center from the state of Ohio last year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Expanded health coverage under the Affordable Care Act and hospital initiatives to provide faster, more convenient emergency services in rural and suburban communities have spurred a new wave of emergency department construction.", "og": {"url": "http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/health-reform-convenience-drive-emergency-departme/nf6bL/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/05/23/6a/9e/062113-mercy-ed2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Expanded health coverage under the Affordable Care Act and hospital initiatives to provide faster, more convenient emergency services in rural and suburban communities have spurred a new wave of emergency department construction.", "title": "Health reform, convenience drive emergency department..."}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalnews", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2014/05/23/5a/0c/021214-fort-ham-ed6.jpg", "description": "Expanded health coverage under the Affordable Care Act and hospital initiatives to provide faster, more convenient emergency services in rural and suburban communities have spurred a new wave of emergency department construction.", "card": "summary", "title": "Health reform, convenience drive emergency department construction"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "journal-news", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/health-reform-convenience-drive-emergency-departme/nf6bL/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2483864/news/news/health-reform-convenience-drive-emergency-departme/nf6bL/", "keywords": "Butler County,HJNhptop,HJNhomepage", "google-site-verification": "4Q9_13tOch6eLcVYCHatUepAlnmJQbgHMCB16qdjcy0", "news_keywords": "Butler County,HJNhptop,HJNhomepage"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3379\"", "article_summary": "In Butler County alone, more than $8.4 million in emergency department (ED) upgrades or construction have occurred in the past two years.\nThe Mercy Health network in June 2013 expanded its emergency department at Fairfield Hospital to include an extra six patient bays.\nIn Hamilton, the Kettering-owned Fort Hamilton Hospital underwent $5 million in construction to expand its emergency department to 35 patient beds.\nLike hospital EDs, freestanding centers are fully equipped to diagnose and treat acute conditions and severe trauma.\nBy Hannah Poturalski and Randy TuckerStaff WritersExpanded health coverage under the Affordable Care Act and hospital initiatives to provide faster, more convenient emergency services in rural and suburban communities have spurred a new wave of emergency department construction."}
