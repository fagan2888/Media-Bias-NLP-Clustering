In an interview with The Washington Post\u2019s David Ignatius on Wednesday, the Director of National Intelligence admitted that he had completely underestimated ISIS. He didn't anticipate how fast the Iraqi Army would fall apart, nor the \u201cwill to fight\u201d among Islamic State troops. \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he somewhat lamely added, \u201csee that.\u201d\n\nBy now, most Americans realize ISIS caught the intelligence community by surprise. Clapper and his spies also thought that the Russians wouldn\u2019t openly invade Ukraine, which maybe they actually got right, depending on how \u201copenly\u201d we would say the Russians invaded.\n\nRelated: New ISIS Audio Urges U.S. Muslims to Kill Americans\n\nTo be fair, it\u2019s easy to nitpick the intelligence community and demand it to be omniscient. It is not. But for a nation that spends as much as the US on intelligence (over $50 billion a year, according to The Washington Post), we seem to have somehow missed the two biggest geopolitical events of the Obama presidency.\n\nMore damningly, Clapper\u2019s admission comes on the heels of several instances of active malfeasance by the CIA, including its spying on the Senate Intelligence Committee as its staff members read the CIA's report on its detention and interrogation program. John Brennan, the CIA director, stoutly and wrongly denied anything had happened.\n\nThat followed Clapper lying under oath the previous year, when he told Sen. Ron Wyden that the intelligence community was definitely not collecting \u201cany kind of data at all\u201d on the American public. To be fair, that was basically true, if by \u201cAmerican public\u201d he meant \u201cGerman public\u201d and by \u201cany kind of data at all\u201d he meant \u201cdata other than Angela Merkel\u2019s cell phone records.\u201d But otherwise it\u2019s a bald-faced lie, though it might have been true for all it bothered the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nSure, Darryl Issa and several others called for James Clapper\u2019s head, but without success. Your Chicago-school economists, of course, would say, obviously, the more efficient, market-based solution would be to take Congress out of the equation entirely so Americans could themselves spy on the CIA and thus reduce market distortion. But in the real world, we expect more effectiveness and integrity out of the intelligence community. So why haven't Clapper and Brennan been fired?\n\nRelated: French National Kidnapped in Algeria by Terror Group\n\nWell, essentially for two reasons. First, getting the Senate to confirm another senior intelligence official would be hell. Congress is in a surly mood on intelligence issues. It\u2019s in a surly mood on most issues, frankly, but especially with the spies. The accumulating presumption of the intelligence community\u2019s spying on both the demos and their representatives has embarrassed them.\n\nOrdinarily, the executive branch\u2019s upstaging the legislature wouldn\u2019t be a problem; the disparity between the million-man federal government and the handful of legislative staffers monitoring it means that the executive can mostly operate in secrecy. Congress doesn't have the ability to oversee even a tiny percentage of federal programs; even on those it does, it mostly takes the federal government\u2019s word for it.\n\nIt\u2019s really only when that power imbalance gets rubbed in Congress\u2019s face that the Members get cranky \u2013 for example, spying on their staff while they monitor the spying. Plus, a confirmation hearing would include unpleasant questions about ISIS, the Russian reset, START, Assad, Benghazi, and Iran blowing through another nuclear deadline. Obama and Harry Reid do not want to risk nasty sound bites on a lengthy and embarrassing confirmation process for new intelligence chiefs, and certainly not forty days before the midterms.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s ISIS Strategy Will Be His Jimmy Carter Moment\n\nThe second reason Brennan and Clapper still have jobs is that Obama likes them. Brennan in particular was the President's personal counterterrorism advisor before Brennan became CIA director and had a direct role in shaping the administration's conception of the War on Terror as a counterterrorism problem.\n\nIt has been well reported by now that drone strikes have gone up under Obama; that Obama spends his weekly counterterrorism hour leafing through binders of aspiring targets to select the ones for culling; that Obama is whacking targets all over Pakistan and the Middle East, reportedly with great daring.\n\nGlobal counterterrorism \u2013 unmanned robots and ninjas killing jihadis, sans warning, sans risk, based on Obama's personal Book of the Dead \u2013 is a crisp distillation of the Obama Weltanschauung. It was bloodless, and certainly not \u201cstupid s***,\u201d and intended to take the place of George Bush\u2019s Long War.\n\nRelated: The U.S. Is Fumbling the War of Ideas Against ISIS\n\nIt would eclipse Bush\u2019s big thoughts about WHY terrorists were crazy, where they came from, and why they came from there. Bush, the deep thinker, had been overly intellectualizing a fight that was to the Alpha Betas in the Obama Administration, a simple muscle movement. Who needs this democracy crusade when we have drones?\n\nBrennan and Clapper brought the President \u201ccounterterrorism,\u201d and counterterrorism brought us Osama bin Laden. But it also brought us the collapse of Iraq and the unshackling of Russia from any basic strategic constraint. It brought us a host of unexpected and ill-reacted geopolitical upheavals, from the Iranian pro-democracy riots in 2009 to the Arab Spring to the implosion of Syria, ignored until it was a disaster, further ignored until it was a crisis. Redefining the world as a counterterrorism matrix blinded us to the macro shifts; it overlaid a falsely individual heuristic of victory \u2013 is X dead? \u2013 onto a world that shifts en masse. And despite all the dead bodies in Pakistan, ISIS was one such masse.\n\nSo in one sense Clapper and Brennan should not be fired. They\u2019ve given us nothing the President did not want, and have lost none of his confidence. But by now, they should have lost some of ours.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It is baffling how James Clapper still has a job.", "title": "Our Intelligence Director Dismissed ISIS: Why Does He Still Have a Job?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/09/23/Our-Intelligence-Director-Dismissed-ISIS-Why-Does-He-Still-Have-Job", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07252014_ISIS.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2014/09/23/Our-Intelligence-Director-Dismissed-ISIS-Why-Does-He-Still-Have-Job", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07252014_ISIS.jpg", "creator": "@AndrewLPeek", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It is baffling how James Clapper still has a job.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce2f7\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he somewhat lamely added, \u201csee that.\u201dBy now, most Americans realize ISIS caught the intelligence community by surprise.\nRelated: New ISIS Audio Urges U.S. Muslims to Kill AmericansTo be fair, it\u2019s easy to nitpick the intelligence community and demand it to be omniscient.\nBut in the real world, we expect more effectiveness and integrity out of the intelligence community.\nBrennan and Clapper brought the President \u201ccounterterrorism,\u201d and counterterrorism brought us Osama bin Laden.\nIn an interview with The Washington Post\u2019s David Ignatius on Wednesday, the Director of National Intelligence admitted that he had completely underestimated ISIS."}
