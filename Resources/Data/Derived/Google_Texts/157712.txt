Hey, Boulderites! I’ll be giving a talk about Mars and the Curiosity rover at the Chautauqua Community House on March 2, 2015, at 7 p.m. The talk, “Where Has Our Curiosity Taken Us,” is an overview of the mission loaded with cool imagery and fun science.

I’ve given this talk here and there, and I really have fun going over the amazing things we’ve learned since the rover touched down in 2012. I’ll talk about the launch and landing, the roving, the photos, and the science Curiosity has undertaken.
