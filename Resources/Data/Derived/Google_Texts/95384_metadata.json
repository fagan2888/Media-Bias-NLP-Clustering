Col. Ralph Peters (Ret.) was very blunt in his assessment of the incident in the Baltic Sea on Monday, when a Russian warplane buzzed awfully close to a U.S. Navy destroyer.\n\n\"I'm very, very worried that in the closing months of Obama's presidency we're gonna see American blood,\u201d Peters said in an interview with Fox News.\n\nIt was a bold prediction, but one that former Ambassador John Bolton agrees with. During his own conversation on Fox Friday morning, Bolton predicted \u201cthere\u2019s more\u201d Russian aggression to come.\n\n\u201cIf that airplane had caught a gust of wind, it could have been right up against that destroyer,\u201d the ambassador explained.\n\nRussia\u2019s latest stint in the Baltic Sea signals to our NATO allies that the U.S. can\u2019t take care of itself, he continued.\n\n\u201cI just hope Obama doesn\u2019t apologize for destroyer getting in the way of that airplane.\u201d\n\nBased on the White House's typical response to foreign intimidation, Bolton\u2019s question is a fair one. Before the Russian airplane flew near our destroyer, Iran captured 10 of our American sailors and celebrated it. Secretary of State John Kerry actually thanked Iran for their compassion during the ordeal. President Obama, meanwhile, continues to defend his nuclear deal with the nation, which has basically given Iran a pass for its bad behavior. A Middle East expert who is very critical of that agreement argues it has severely damaged America\u2019s image as a superpower.\n\nObama is also no stranger to apologies. He has asked for forgiveness on America\u2019s behalf in about every corner of the globe, it seems. In Argentina last month, he noted the \u201cearly dark days\u201d of the CIA and our country\u2019s human rights violations. He continued to express regret over America\u2019s human rights record in Cuba. Yes, Castros\u2019 Cuba, where free speech is suppressed and punished.\n\nOur adversaries are taking advantage of our president\u2019s shows of weakness.\n\nIran will continue to intimidate us \u201cindefinitely,\u201d Bolton argued, for they know that under Obama, \u201cthey will face no consequences.\u201d\n\nA new report indicates that an Iranian general is in Moscow this week to discuss military options with President Putin.\n\nIran is \u201cgoing to push the envelope\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019ll succeed,\u201d Bolton warned.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A fair question..05/27/2016 8:47:15AM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "A fair question.", "title": "Ambassador Bolton Wonders if Obama Will Apologize for US Destroyer \u2018Getting in Way\u2019 of Russian Airplane", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/04/15/bolton-will-obama-apologize-for-us-destroyer-getting-in-way-of-russian-airplane-n2148834", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2011/265/2011-09-22T225311Z_01_EMZ219_RTRIDSP_0_UN-ASSEMBLY.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "A fair question.", "title": "Ambassador Bolton Wonders if Obama Will Apologize for US Destroyer \u2018Getting in Way\u2019 of Russian Airplane", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/04/15/bolton-will-obama-apologize-for-us-destroyer-getting-in-way-of-russian-airplane-n2148834", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2011/265/2011-09-22T225311Z_01_EMZ219_RTRIDSP_0_UN-ASSEMBLY.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Bolton: Will Obama Apologize For US Destroyer \u2018Getting in Way\u2019 of Russian Airplane?, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Before the Russian airplane flew near our destroyer, Iran captured 10 of our American sailors and celebrated it.\nPresident Obama, meanwhile, continues to defend his nuclear deal with the nation, which has basically given Iran a pass for its bad behavior.\n\u201cI just hope Obama doesn\u2019t apologize for destroyer getting in the way of that airplane.\u201dBased on the White House's typical response to foreign intimidation, Bolton\u2019s question is a fair one.\n\u201cIf that airplane had caught a gust of wind, it could have been right up against that destroyer,\u201d the ambassador explained.\nDuring his own conversation on Fox Friday morning, Bolton predicted \u201cthere\u2019s more\u201d Russian aggression to come."}
