Cynthia Black, lead pastor at the Church of the Redeemer in Morristown, said she had to quickly rewrite her sermon after the court ruled Friday not to overturn a Mercer County judge\u2019s declaration that same-sex couples in the state could be legally married.\n\n\u201cMy sermon was pre-planned, all about the earth, then along comes this ruling. As a lesbian I\u2019m not going to ignore it,\u201d Black said this morning. \u201cSo trying to transform a sermon about the earth to a sermon about the Supreme Court was a little bit of a challenge.\u201d\n\nThe Episcopal Morristown church is in their \u201ccreation season,\u201d Black said, in which they focus on a different element of creation each week. During today\u2019s service, a bowl of dirt was brought forward during the offertory, a symbol that Black equates to moral justice.\n\n\u201cIn gardeners terms it gets under our fingernails, and this is really the justice that needs to get under our fingernails, and get so far under our fingernails that we can\u2019t scrub it out. And I think that\u2019s happening,\u201d she said.\n\nAt least half the congregation at Redeemer in Morristown is LGBT, according to Black.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a wonderful thing that has happened, it\u2019s a sign that the moral arc of the universe is long, and it really does bend toward justice,\u201d Black said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of bigger things, not only justice for LGBT people, but justice for any person who is different, justice for any person trampled on for being \u2018less than.\u2019 \u201c\n\nBlack understands the distinction between civil unions and marriages \u2014 though \u201cmarried\u201d to her partner in 1988 in a commitment ceremony, a boating accident in 2010 left her with a broken back and a newfound understanding of the challenges that come with the limited legal rights offered to couples who don\u2019t possess a marriage license.\n\nOne year later, the church pension fund changed its rules, requiring a couple to be legally married to receive benefits.\n\n\u201cIf I had died in that boating accident, (my wife) Becky would not have received spouse benefits. So we went off to Massachusetts,\u201d Black said. \u201cWe would have much rather done it here, but we couldn\u2019t wait. We needed the protection for her.\u201d\n\nChurch of the Redeemer in Morristown was planning to perform a marriage at 12:01 a.m. Monday, Black said, but the town in which the couple lives was slow to get the paperwork done, so the ceremony will be held later this week.\n\nIn Montclair, the Rev. Ann Ralosky of First Congregational Church in Montclair said she didn\u2019t feel it necessary to re-work today\u2019s sermon, she talked about the court's ruling during today's services.\n\n\u201cThis has been an integral part of our community,\u201d Ralosky said. \u201cI\u2019m literally preaching to the choir.\u201d\n\nRalosky will open today\u2019s service with a celebratory prayer, and she said the mood around the church, which is about one-third LGBT, is very joyous today.\n\nShe said Friday\u2019s ruling was crucial because it added legal security to relationships that had been strong for years already.\n\n\u201cThe love was there, the commitment was there, but the protection wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Ralosky said. \u201cReally what this means is that the state has caught up with what we\u2019ve known all along \u2014 that marriage strengthens communities.\u201d\n\nIn her Morristown church this morning, Black touched on the universal justice she had spoken about earlier, and she pushed congregants to keep fighting until every underrepresented person was treated as an equal.\n\n\u201cStand with me and promise to share the earth of justice, rising and unscrubbable,\u201d Black said at the end the sermon. \u201cThe earth and all that is in it is not ours to exploit. We and every living thing are precious and holy, lovable and loving.\n\n\u201cBe a gardener,\u201d said said. \u201cDig a ditch, toil and sweat. And turn the earth upside down.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@river','gay-marriage','montclair','morristown'", "title": "N.J. ministers rework Sunday services after ruling on gay marriage", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"N.J. ministers rework Sunday services after ruling on gay marriage\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/10/ministers_scramble_to_rework_sunday_services_after_supreme_court_ruling_on_gay_marriage.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/10/13615801-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11469692\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-20T16:40:45Z\", \"author\": \"Tom Wright-Piersanti/The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"gay-marriage\",\"montclair\",\"morristown\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/10/13615801-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@LedgerTWP", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "The court ruled Friday not to overturn a Mercer County judge's declaration that same-sex couples in the state could be legally married."}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, October 20, 2013, 12:40 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/10/montclair-churchjpg-2c5e540844a7070c.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"twrightpiersanti\", \"author_nickname\": \"Tom Wright-Piersanti/The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"8744221\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The court ruled Friday not to overturn a Mercer County judge's declaration that same-sex couples in the state could be legally married.", "title": "N.J. ministers rework Sunday services after ruling on gay marriage", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/10/ministers_scramble_to_rework_sunday_services_after_supreme_court_ruling_on_gay_marriage.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, October 20, 2013, 12:41 PM", "article_author": "Tom Wright-Piersanti/The Star-Ledger", "Description": "The court ruled Friday not to overturn a Mercer County judge's declaration that same-sex couples in the state could be legally married."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcdc3\"", "article_summary": "Ann Ralosky of First Congregational Church in Montclair said she didn\u2019t feel it necessary to re-work today\u2019s sermon, she talked about the court's ruling during today's services.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a wonderful thing that has happened, it\u2019s a sign that the moral arc of the universe is long, and it really does bend toward justice,\u201d Black said.\n\u201cMy sermon was pre-planned, all about the earth, then along comes this ruling.\nShe said Friday\u2019s ruling was crucial because it added legal security to relationships that had been strong for years already.\n\u201cStand with me and promise to share the earth of justice, rising and unscrubbable,\u201d Black said at the end the sermon."}
