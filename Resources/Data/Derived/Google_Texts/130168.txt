A wreck in Beckham County killed an 11-year-old girl and injured another child and a woman Friday afternoon.

The Oklahoma Highway Patrol said the wreck occurred around 4:23 p.m. Friday, about seven miles south of Elk City where State Highway 6 and State Highway 152 meet.

According to OHP, 29-year-old Cathy Michelle Baker of Tishomingo was heading southbound on State Highway 6 in a 2006 Chevrolet Trail Blazer, while 44-year-old Steven Phillip Lay of Altus was traveling northbound on State Highway 6 in a 2013 Freightliner. OHP said Lay struck Baker's vehicle when she made a left-hand turn onto State Highway 152.

Baker was traveling with two girls, ages 11 and 12, according to the collision report.

The reporting trooper said the 11-year-old girl was pronounced dead at the scene due to massive injuries sustained in the collision. The 12-year-old girl was transported to OU Medical Center with head injuries, and Baker was treated and released from Great Plains Regional Medical Center. Lay was not injured in the wreck.

The collision report states everyone was wearing seatbelts, except for the 11-year-old girl who was ejected from the vehicle.

According to OHP, the cause of the collision was "failure to yield at intersection."
