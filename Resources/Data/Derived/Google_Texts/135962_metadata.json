The burly Mr Ballmer brought high-decibel bumptiousness; the svelte Mr Nadella (pictured) speaks in measured tones and quotes Eliot, Nietzsche and Rilke in his news conferences and memos. The new style may in time grate as much as the old, but so far investors like what they see. Since Mr Nadella took over in February, the technology giant\u2019s share price has climbed by 23%, to nearly $45\u2014the highest since April 2000, shortly after Mr Ballmer\u2019s tenure began.\n\nOn his first day in the job Mr Nadella said he planned to make Microsoft fit for a \u201cmobile-first and cloud-first world\u201d. Microsoft, the king of the desktop age, has been dethroned by the smartphone revolution. But Mr Nadella thinks the ubiquity of its software, in both homes and businesses, still lends it power. On July 22nd he gave his first proper progress report, in the shape of Microsoft\u2019s fourth-quarter results.\n\nThose numbers showed that the cloud part of Mr Nadella\u2019s plan is starting to lift Microsoft up, but that the mobile side is weighing it down. The purchase of Nokia\u2019s mobile-phone division, agreed upon last year but completed only in April, has worsened the drag. Two months\u2019 worth of the formerly Finnish phonemaker\u2019s figures added $2 billion to revenue but subtracted $692m from operating profit. Total revenue in the three months to June, at $23.4 billion, beat analysts\u2019 forecasts; but thanks to Nokia, net income, at $4.6 billion, fell short\u2014and was less than it was a year before.\n\nMr Nadella already has plans for the ex-Nokians. On July 17th he said that Microsoft would shed 18,000 of its 127,000 staff, and that 12,500 would go from their ranks. Microsoft will focus more on cheaper smartphones, the fastest-growing bit of the market, and exclusively on Windows Phone, its own operating system\u2014which lags far behind Apple\u2019s iOS and Google\u2019s Android. An inexpensive range running on Android, which Nokia unveiled only in February, will be switched to Windows. An internal e-mail leaked to tech websites implied that Nokia\u2019s more basic mobile phones would be phased out.\n\nOn the cloud side, Mr Nadella had cheerier news. Companies and consumers are buying more software and services by online subscription; businesses are doing more computing in Microsoft\u2019s data centres (or in their own with Microsoft\u2019s help). Companies\u2019 spending on cloud services in the quarter was 147% more than a year before and is running at an annual rate of $4.4 billion. Some other things have also gone Mr Nadella\u2019s way. Demand for personal computers (PCs) has bottomed out, as companies at last replace old machines.\n\nLooking ahead, Mr Nadella is placing a good deal of faith in what he calls \u201cdual users\u201d: people who use technology both at work and in their private lives. He believes that Microsoft can give them the software they need for both, and has reorganised some engineers at the company, previously split between consumer and business-to-business units, into single teams.\n\nIt matters less to Microsoft than it did whether that software runs on Windows, the operating system on which it grew rich and fat. To be sure, the firm is still pushing Windows hard, and not only in PCs and its own phones. It has scrapped royalties for devices with screens of less than nine inches, to lure other manufacturers. Its executives purr about the Surface Pro 3, the latest version of its hitherto unsuccessful Windows tablet. But Mr Nadella\u2019s first public act as boss, in March, was to release its Office software suite for Apple\u2019s iPad. Microsoft can no longer afford to be fussy.\n\nAlthough Mr Nadella promises a leaner Microsoft (layers of management will go, as well as those ex-Nokians), he is not promising a narrower one. He is sticking with Xbox, its home-entertainment system, although he says it is not \u201ccore\u201d. In fact, having added phones, Microsoft is doing more rather than less. Some think that unwise. But the shareholders are happy\u2014including, presumably, Mr Ballmer, who owns more shares than anyone else.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/50_by_50/images/print-edition/20140726_WBP003_0.jpg", "sailthru.flytitle": "Microsoft", "description": "The newish chief executive offers good intentions but mixed news", "pubdate": 20140726, "og": {"site_name": "The Economist", "description": "The newish chief executive offers good intentions but mixed news", "title": "Cloud lifting", "url": "http://www.economist.com/news/business/21608756-newish-chief-executive-offers-good-intentions-mixed-news-cloud-lifting", "image": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140726_WBP003_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.rubric": "The newish chief executive offers good intentions but mixed news", "sailthru.date": "1970-01-01 00:00:00", "twitter": {"image": "https://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140726_WBP003_0.jpg", "site": "@TheEconomist", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20140726_WBP003_0.jpg", "revisit-after": "1 day", "sailthru.web_section": "Business", "fb": {"pages": 6013004059, "app_id": 173277756049645}, "sailthru.imagepath": "images/print-edition/20140726_WBP003_0.jpg", "articleid": 21608756, "sailthru.image.thumb_mfte": "http://cdn.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/ec_related_article_image/images/print-edition/20140726_WBP003_0.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "Microsoft", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theeconomist"}, "sailthru.printdate": "2014-07-26 00:00:00", "news_keywords": "Microsoft"}, "article_summary": "On the cloud side, Mr Nadella had cheerier news.\nThose numbers showed that the cloud part of Mr Nadella\u2019s plan is starting to lift Microsoft up, but that the mobile side is weighing it down.\nBut Mr Nadella thinks the ubiquity of its software, in both homes and businesses, still lends it power.\nOn his first day in the job Mr Nadella said he planned to make Microsoft fit for a \u201cmobile-first and cloud-first world\u201d.\nIn fact, having added phones, Microsoft is doing more rather than less."}
