An early morning altercation in Old Town leaves a woman recovering from a punch to the face and a possible concussion and the man who hit her in jail on multiple charges.

It happened at about 1:35 a.m. Sunday morning near 150 N Mosley. That's near the Wichita Brewing Co.

Wichita Police say a 25-year-old man was seen striking the woman once, knocking her unconscious then going after another woman and a man before being taken into custody.

While being placed in a police transport vehicle the suspect continued his violent tirade, kicking an officer in the arm.

He was booked into Sedgwick County jail on aggravated battery, two counts of simple battery and battery of a law enforcement officer.

The woman he knocked unconscious was taken to St. Francis hospital for treatment. No other injuries were reported.
