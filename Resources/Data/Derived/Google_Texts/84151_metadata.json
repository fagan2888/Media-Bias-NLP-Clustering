While it\u2019s easy to support using eminent domain for the ACP when it\u2019s not on your land, there are reasonable alternatives to build the pipeline without eminent domain; however, if Dominion continues as planned your neighbors will be seriously exploited.\n\nExisting easements offer one alternative. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission mandates, \u201cThe use, widening, or extension of existing rights-of-way must be considered in locating proposed facilities.\u201d A web of existing rights-of-way covers Virginia, providing multiple routes on which Dominion could co-locate almost the entire ACP without significantly lengthening it. Dominion itself owns the most promising route. Yet, because this law has no teeth, Dominion has no incentive to avoid taking more private property.\n\nIn addition to more responsible routes, Dominion could also acquire land using more responsible methods, such as royalties instead of eminent domain. Negotiated royalties would entice willingly landowners by more fairly compensating them for their indefinite loss of rights while removing the threat of eminent domain. Because pipelines don\u2019t need to go straight like highways, Dominion could easily route the ACP by negotiating agreements with willing landowners instead of forcing it over 2,500 helpless victims.\n\nIf Dominion paid landowners $0.00000002 per cubic foot of gas shipped, the average landowner would receive $10,950 annually ($547,500 over 50 years). Based on numbers from the American Gas Association, a royalty this large for all impacted landowners would raise the average household\u2019s gas costs by only $2.54 annually.\n\nUsing eminent domain doesn\u2019t change the project\u2019s overall cost; it simply forces landowners to bear that cost for Dominion. Some contend Dominion will \u201ctake care\u201d of landowners, but only the uninformed and unaffected have the luxury of such naivet\u00e9. Here are a handful of the abuses your neighbors will face:\n\n\u2022Property devaluation: Local realtors I\u2019ve spoken with already see depressed prices and buyers cancelling contracts due to the pipeline.\n\n\u2022\u00b7Low-ball offers: Condemning authorities normally offer a fraction of \u201cjust compensation\u201d outside of court.\n\n\u2022Taxation without rights: Owners will lose their property rights indefinitely, but still must pay property taxes on the easement.\n\n\u2022Utility corridor: Almost without exception, pipeline companies seek rights to install an unlimited number of pipelines on easements they take.\n\n\u2022 \u201cQuick take\u201d power: Land can be taken before landowners receive payment or trial is held.\n\n\u2022No jury trial: While Virginia\u2019s constitution guarantees jury trials for eminent domain cases, Dominion filing in federal courts skirts this protection, making it almost impossible to obtain \u201cjust compensation.\u201d\n\n\u2022Business losses: If a farm or business loses future income the landowner will not be paid.\n\n\u2022Restrictions after construction: Not only will Dominion take almost all rights to land it confiscates for the easement, it will also attempt to control landowners\u2019 remaining, surrounding property. For example:\n\nBefore any construction \u201cin the vicinity\u201d of the easement\u2013as much as 100 feet on either side\u2013landowners must obtain Dominion\u2019s permission and pay Dominion for any studies or fieldwork it mandates.\n\nDominion can require landowners to purchase a $1 million liability policy, minimum, for construction on their own land.\n\nDominion can destroy paved driveways and \u201cwill have no responsibility for the restoration of the pavement [\u2026] or any other associated costs.\u201d\n\nAny road crossing built after installation will require very costly reinforced concrete slabs and other protection \u201cat no expense to [Dominion].\u201d This is especially important for farmers who require reinforced crossings for heavy equipment due to weight restrictions.\n\nBig business can be just as coercive and abusive as big government. Our founding fathers built America upon the right to be secure in our property. As Samuel Adams said, \u201cNow what liberty can there be where property is taken without consent?\u201d\n\nSmart and fair ways of pursuing energy development\u2013including natural gas\u2013do exist, but Dominion\u2019s current route and methods are neither smart nor fair. Dominion must do what is right for all Virginian\u2019s not just what is good for Dominion.\n\nAs a conservative myself, I daresay that subsidizing our heating bills by taking our neighbors\u2019 land is no more legitimate than subsidizing Obamacare by taking our health insurance. Both provide for the wants of the masses by trampling on the rights of the individual.\n\nRegarding the ACP, people have told me we all must make \u201csmall sacrifices\u201d for the good of the country. I agree, perhaps we should all \u201csacrifice\u201d one $2.54 cup of coffee next year and let our neighbors keep their land.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.newsleader.com/story/opinion/columnists/2014/12/12/eminent-domain-easy-say/20320383/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Do you think you own your home because you bought the land and built the house?", "og": {"site_name": "The News Leader", "description": "Do you think you own your home because you bought the land and built the house?", "title": "Eminent domain: Easy for you to say", "url": "http://www.newsleader.com/story/opinion/columnists/2014/12/12/eminent-domain-easy-say/20320383/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/newsleader.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Do you think you own your home because you bought the land and built the house?", "creator": "@newsleadernow", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/18d326dd155122617996573d5c043b0ad85be44c/c=0-47-200-247&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Staunton/2014/12/12/B9315457799Z.1_20141212164400_000_GG39CKPVA.1-0.jpg", "title": "Eminent domain: Easy for you to say", "site": "@newsleadernow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=858239247", "fb": {"app_id": 169868743049940}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd00ff\"", "article_summary": "\u2022Taxation without rights: Owners will lose their property rights indefinitely, but still must pay property taxes on the easement.\nIn addition to more responsible routes, Dominion could also acquire land using more responsible methods, such as royalties instead of eminent domain.\nUsing eminent domain doesn\u2019t change the project\u2019s overall cost; it simply forces landowners to bear that cost for Dominion.\nWhile it\u2019s easy to support using eminent domain for the ACP when it\u2019s not on your land, there are reasonable alternatives to build the pipeline without eminent domain; however, if Dominion continues as planned your neighbors will be seriously exploited.\nAs a conservative myself, I daresay that subsidizing our heating bills by taking our neighbors\u2019 land is no more legitimate than subsidizing Obamacare by taking our health insurance."}
