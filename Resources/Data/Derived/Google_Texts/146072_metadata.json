Polanski then fled to France.\n\nPolanski sought a dismissal of the case in 2008, but his motion was denied in a ruling that was upheld by an appellate court.\n\nSeveral efforts to extradite Polanski to California have failed.\n\nPolanski was accepting an award in 2009 in Switzerland, where he has a home, when he was arrested and served 290 days - first in jail and then under house arrest - before Swiss authorities rejected a U.S. request to extradite him and declared he could travel to Switzerland anytime he wanted.\n\nIn October of this year, Polanski, 81, attended the opening of the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw before traveling to Krakow, his childhood city. Polish authorities questioned him there in response to a U.S. request but refused to arrest him.\n\nPolanski\u2019s attorneys have said the latest extradition request neglected to say the director had served 42 days of court-ordered prison time in 1977.\n\n\u201cThe DA\u2019s deliberate omission in its letter was plainly calculated to deceive the Polish government into believing that Polanski is \u2018extraditable\u2019 under the extradition treaty between the United States and Poland, when, in fact, he is not,\u201d the filing said.\n\nPolanski won an Academy Award for best director for his 2002 film \u201cThe Pianist\u201d and was nominated for 1974\u2019s \u201cChinatown\u201d and 1979\u2019s \u201cTess.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Roman Polanski lost his latest bid to have a California court dismiss his 1977 sex case when a judge rejected a motion for a new hearing.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Roman Polanski lost his latest bid to have a California court dismiss his 1977 sex case when a judge rejected a motion for a new hearing.", "title": "Court denies Roman Polanski\u2019s motion to dismiss 1977 sex case", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/24/court-denies-polanskis-motion-to-dismiss-1977-sex-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/30/68d187f5adb6fd2a630f6a7067004d83.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/30/68d187f5adb6fd2a630f6a7067004d83.jpg", "description": "Roman Polanski lost his latest bid to have a California court dismiss his 1977 sex case when a judge rejected a motion for a new hearing.", "card": "summary", "title": "Court denies Roman Polanski\u2019s motion to dismiss 1977 sex case"}, "Author": "Anthony McCartney", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Roman Pola\u0144ski"}, "article_summary": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Roman Polanski lost his latest bid to have a California court dismiss his 1977 sex case when a judge rejected a motion for a new hearing.\nBrandlin\u2019s order states Polanski has other options in his latest push to dismiss the case, including returning to California to address his claims.\nPolanski\u2019s attorneys have said the latest extradition request neglected to say the director had served 42 days of court-ordered prison time in 1977.\nPolanski sought a dismissal of the case in 2008, but his motion was denied in a ruling that was upheld by an appellate court.\nThe prosecutor and Polanski\u2019s attorney have said they understood from a private conversation with the judge handling the case that the time in the prison would serve as Polanski\u2019s punishment."}
