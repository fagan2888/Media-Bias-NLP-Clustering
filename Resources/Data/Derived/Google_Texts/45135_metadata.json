Adam Smith, to implore the president to push even harder to reform a broken immigration system.\n\nRelated Content\n\nThe package of reforms Obama is expected to put into force by executive action would positively impact about 80,000 undocumented people living in Washington State.\n\nThe emotional highpoint of the OneAmerica rally came when Lisette Llerena stepped to the microphone to tell her story of having \u201clived too long in the shadows.\u201d\n\nIn the afternoon chill, Llerena began, \u201cFourteen years ago, I was living in Peru with my husband and daughter.\u201d Seeking a better life, he moved to North Carolina. Llerena and their child joined him three months later. None of them knew a word of English and they struggled financially from the income of his low-paying job. \u201cWe paid taxes,\u201d said the 40-year-old woman. \u201cWe contributed to our community. I volunteered at the school library.\u201d\n\nThree more children were born in North Carolina. She knew that at any moment their immigration status would be discovered, and their lives torn apart. \u201cWhen my oldest daughter turned fourteen, I had to confess our status to her.\u201d This week, at their home in Federal Way, where they relocated to in the summer of 2011, she told all her children.\n\n\u201cWe are here. We are your friends. We are your neighbors, your co-workers,\u201d said Llerena. \u201cWe dream of a life without fear.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s action calls for up to four million undocumented immigrants who have lived in the United States for at least five years to be able to apply for a program that protects them from deportation. And additional one million people will also gain protection, mainly by expanding the existing program for \u201cDreamers,\u201d young immigrants who came to this country as children.\n\nMayor Murray praised the president\u2019s reforms, though, he added, \u201cthere is much work ahead of us still to do.\u201d In the interim, though, \u201cmillions \u2026 will not have to live in fear.\u201d The crowd, many of them holdings signs that read: \u201cPresident Obama: Leave No Family Behind!\u201d cheered loudly. Murray, however, added that future reforms must ensure that all five million immigrants, under Obama\u2019s plan, will receive government subsidies for health care under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs the New York Times reported today, \u201cThe White House decision to deny health benefits also underscores how far the president\u2019s expected actions will fall short of providing the kind of full membership in American society that activists have spent decades fighting for.\u201d\n\nStanding on crutches as he recovers from hip surgery, Rep. Adam Smith said, \u201cThere is only one permanent solution and that is comprehensive immigration reform.. The Democrat who has presented the state 9th Congressional District since 1997 added that it is \u201cshameful\u201d that Republicans in Congress have done nothing to improve the nation\u2019s dysfunctional immigration enforcement system. \u201cPlease keep the pressure on.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hours before President Obama was to reveal plans Thursday evening to shield", "og": {"site_name": "Seattle Weekly", "description": "Hours before President Obama was to reveal plans Thursday evening to shield up to five million undocumented workers from deportation, dozens of people gathered outside", "title": "Immigration Rally in Seattle: \u2018We Dream of a Life Without Fear\u2019", "url": "http://", "image": "http://archive.seattleweekly.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=5Wp_ErjEw1WMNT945j4IVc$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYt1JIExin8jezgKUcwHls9wWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "IMMIGRATION, OBAMA, PRESIDENT, LLERENA, MILLION, ADDED, FEAR, IMMIGRANTS, MURRAY, REFORMS,", "fb": {"app_id": 500578586675733}, "msvalidate.01": "3443F17DFB93961891E95B1452B50579", "google-site-verification": "HB1ruhwjr9G2iMWnFITxFS9YXCHqRDvxfYM7NFy7KA0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce51\"", "article_summary": "Related ContentThe package of reforms Obama is expected to put into force by executive action would positively impact about 80,000 undocumented people living in Washington State.\n\u201cWe dream of a life without fear.\u201dObama\u2019s action calls for up to four million undocumented immigrants who have lived in the United States for at least five years to be able to apply for a program that protects them from deportation.\nShe knew that at any moment their immigration status would be discovered, and their lives torn apart.\nMurray, however, added that future reforms must ensure that all five million immigrants, under Obama\u2019s plan, will receive government subsidies for health care under the Affordable Care Act.\nNone of them knew a word of English and they struggled financially from the income of his low-paying job."}
