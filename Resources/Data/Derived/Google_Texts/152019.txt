Patton Oswalt, a comedian and self-professed nerd who spends a lot of time shouting at people on the Internet (including Salon), confronted his Internet haters in a promo video for Monday night’s Webby Awards.

In the video, Oswalt meets the “cowards” who hurl insults from behind their computers. They (like Salon journalists) turn out to be pretty nice people who have full lives and a host of accomplishments. “Fine, I get it, okay! I came here because I thought you guys would be a bunch of losers. Clearly, I was wrong,” Oswalt declares, in defeat.
