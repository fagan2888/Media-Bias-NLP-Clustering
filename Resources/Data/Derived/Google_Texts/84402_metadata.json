While those with less than two years of experience make $62,780 on average, those with more than 10 years of experience can expect to make well over $100,000. That means as you progress and your career grows, so will your salary.\n\nTop Benefits\n\nIn addition to high salaries, health IT jobs also offer top perks and benefits.
