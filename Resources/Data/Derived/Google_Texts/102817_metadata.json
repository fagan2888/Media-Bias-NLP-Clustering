Patel\n\nHowever, concerns related to biosimilars\u2019 safety and efficacy profiles remain, and the establishment of a regulatory pathway that allows for their development has been followed by calls for intense postmarketing pharmacovigilance.\n\nLicensure pathway\n\nThe Affordable Care Act created an abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be \u201cbiosimilar\u201d to or \u201cinterchangeable\u201d with an FDA-licensed biological product.\n\nA biological product is considered to be \u201cbiosimilar\u201d if data demonstrate that the product is highly similar to an already-approved biological product \u2014 notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components \u2014 and there are no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety, purity and potency.\n\nAlthough an abbreviated new drug application for small molecule generic compounds simplifies the requirement for proof of safety and efficacy through demonstration of bioequivalence, a biosimilar also must demonstrate safety and efficacy in one of the primary indications of the reference product.\n\nBased on the totality of evidence, a biosimilar still can be approved for the reference products\u2019 other indications; thus, it is critical to consider the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics/biodistribution and safety differences in each indication for different patient populations.\n\nTo meet the additional standard of interchangeability, an applicant also must demonstrate that the biosimilar can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient, and that the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating between the use of the biosimilar and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product alone.\n\nInterchangeable products may be automatically substituted for the reference product by a pharmacist without the intervention of the prescribing health care provider; however, policies regarding automatic drug substitution are governed by state laws, which can vary significantly. Further, institutional pharmacy and therapeutics committees may conduct their own analyses based on safety and efficacy data, as well as cost considerations, to develop their own internal guidelines.\n\nIn March, filgrastim-sndz (Zarxio, Sandoz) became the first biosimilar approved in the United States.\n\nFilgrastim-sndz is a leukocyte growth factor used primarily to decrease the incidence of infection \u2014 manifested by febrile neutropenia \u2014 in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies who also receive myelosuppressive anticancer drugs. It is approved for the same five indications as its reference product, filgrastim (Neupogen, Amgen).\n\nOf note, filgrastim-sndz is approved only as a biosimilar, not as an interchangeable product.\n\nEffects on access, costs\n\nCMS recently published the final rule for the 2016 Physician Fee Schedule, in which biosimilars will be paid under Medicare Part B the same way it pays for generic drugs.\n\nCMS hopes that the payment policy will encourage greater competition and improve the quality, price and access to biologic medicines.\n\nAlthough traditional generics are 80% to 90% cheaper than the brand, biosimilars are expected to be only 20% to 25% cheaper given the complexity of developing these compounds.\n\nWholesale acquisition costs for a 300-\u00b5g syringe are $275.66 for filgrastim-sndz vs. $324.30 for filgrastim. For a 480-\u00b5g syringe, the cost is $438.98 for the biosimilar and $516.40 for the reference product.\n\nIt is unlikely that biosimilars will have the same economic impact on drug costs compared to small molecule generic drugs. The relative cost differential between a biosimilar and its reference product, coupled with general lack of large comparative trials, may dampen clinicians\u2019 enthusiasm to utilize biosimilars.", "article_metadata": {"site_name": "healiotwo", "description": "Hemonc Today | Cancer is the major indication for six of the 10 best-selling biological products.Meanwhile, the cost of cancer biologics in the United States has doubled from 2006 to 2012, increasing about 10% to 15% per year.
