TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — One of New Jersey’s “Real Housewives” is set to be freed from the big house just days before Christmas.

Teresa Giudice (JOO’-dys) will be released Wednesday from the Danbury Federal Correctional Institution in Connecticut, her lawyer said. She will then head home to her husband, Joe, and their four daughters in Montville, where she will be on home confinement until Feb. 5.

Her attorney, James Leonard Jr., said his client is upbeat and looking forward to coming home. Leonard said he plans to drive Giudice home from prison, but he declined to provide more specific details about her release.

Giudice has been at the prison since January. She and her husband pleaded guilty last year to bankruptcy fraud.

They admitted hiding assets from bankruptcy creditors and submitting phony loan applications to get some $5 million in mortgages and construction loans.

Joe Giudice also pleaded guilty to failing to pay taxes. He’s expected to start his 41-month sentence in March and has said he will serve his term at the Federal Correctional Institution at Fort Dix in southern Jersey.

A federal judge staggered the couple’s sentences in deference to their children.

Joe Giudice is not an American citizen and could be deported to Italy when he’s released.
