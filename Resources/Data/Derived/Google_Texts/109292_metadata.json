That\u2019s compared with 44 percent of Californians overall.\n\n\u201cWe know California is a diverse state ethnically and linguistically,\u201d said Jordan Medina, a health policy fellow with Greenlining and lead author of the study. \u201cMoving forward, if the Affordable Care Act is going to work in California, we have to make sure those populations are represented in the health insurance marketplace.\u201d\n\nAs part of its analysis, Greenlining interviewed certified enrollment counselors working to help people sign up for insurance through Covered California. While online sign-up was available in English and Spanish, people who spoke other languages had only printed material available. Counselors reported that they ran out of materials in at least some languages.\n\nCounselors said they preferred helping people sign up by using the online portal, but since it was available only in English and Spanish, it slowed them down. A counselor with an agency that worked with Japanese-Americans told Greenlining, \u201cWe tried to use the website, because that\u2019s what Covered California suggested we do, but the line-by-line translation with elderly Japanese-Americans made the process extremely tedious.\u201d\n\nGreenlining called on Covered California to make the online sign-up available in the 13 most common languages spoken in California.\n\nCovered California spokeswoman Anne Gonzales said the agency is looking into this, \u201cbut there is no firm date on when that functionality will be added, or which languages will be added.\u201d\n\nProblems with both the Spanish-language marketing campaign and the Spanish-language website were widely reported earlier this year, and Greenlining mentioned these issues. Gonzales pointed to a Spanish-language working group at Covered California that \u201crecalibrated and focused resources\u201d on making improvements in these areas. She said Covered California is currently reviewing its resources for Asian-language translations as well, including Mandarin, Korean, Vietnamese and Hmong.\n\nCuriously, one of the major issues Greenlining pointed out has already been addressed by the Covered California board. In the first open enrollment period, certified enrollment counselors were paid $58 for every person they enrolled in a plan. But counselors told Greenlining that the fee did not compensate them for the level of work required.\n\nGonzales said that Covered California is \u201cmoving away from that business model.\u201d During the first open enrollment, there was a division between outreach/education and enrollment. Covered California grantees doing educational events could not also sign people up for insurance.\n\nThat\u2019s changing now. Covered California is instituting a \u201cnavigator\u201d model and will award a total of $16.9 million in grants to organizations that will handle \u201coutreach, education and enrollment.\u201d\n\nGreenlining also called on Covered California to move forward on hiring a diversity officer.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, this helps with accountability,\u201d Medina said. \u201cIf you have someone whose sole responsibility it is to make sure that all materials \u2014 whether that be on the Web or printed materials \u2014 if there\u2019s one person in charge of that, it makes it really easy for community groups to partner with Covered California to make sure it\u2019s done in an equitable way.\u201d\n\nGreenlining credited Covered California, saying that the state \u201cled the nation in implementing the Affordable Care Act,\u201d but Medina also observed that the rollout was always expected to be a multi-year effort. \u201cAs we move farther into implementation, Covered California is going to have to really pay attention to hard-to-reach groups,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s particularly crucial to outreach to Californians who don\u2019t speak English well.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "For starters, advocates recommended more -- and better translated -- materials in many languages.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Covered California Needs Better Outreach to Limited-English Speakers, Advocates Say\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/06\\/26\\/covered-california-needs-better-outreach-to-limited-english-speakers-advocates-say\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-26 12:44:46\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-06-26 16:00:46\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":19741,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[\"Covered California\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Obamacare\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/01\\/CoveredCA_Spanish-e1388775098705.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "For starters, advocates recommended more -- and better translated -- materials in many languages.", "title": "Covered California Needs Better Outreach to Limited-English Speakers, Advocates Say", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/06/26/covered-california-needs-better-outreach-to-limited-english-speakers-advocates-say/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/01/CoveredCA_Spanish-640x480.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "covered california", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc95af\"", "article_summary": "Covered California is instituting a \u201cnavigator\u201d model and will award a total of $16.9 million in grants to organizations that will handle \u201coutreach, education and enrollment.\u201dGreenlining also called on Covered California to move forward on hiring a diversity officer.\n\u201cAs we move farther into implementation, Covered California is going to have to really pay attention to hard-to-reach groups,\u201d he said.\nShe said Covered California is currently reviewing its resources for Asian-language translations as well, including Mandarin, Korean, Vietnamese and Hmong.\nGonzales pointed to a Spanish-language working group at Covered California that \u201crecalibrated and focused resources\u201d on making improvements in these areas.\nThe report relied on Covered California data, which showed that 20 percent of enrollees do not speak English as a primary language."}
