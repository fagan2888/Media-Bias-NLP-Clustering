STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer announced that the Community Health Center of Richmond in Port Richmond has officially been designated as a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) New Access Point.

By becoming an FQHC, the facility is slated to receive over $500,000 in funding to help increase access to additional critical health care services.

"Public community health centers provide critical primary healthcare services to some of our most vulnerable populations," said Schumer (D-N.Y.) in a statement. "... those on Staten Island [now] will have increased access to comprehensive, quality primary care."

Schumer recognized the Department of Health and Human Services for approving the application previously submitted by the Staten Island health center.

"I applaud the Department of Health and Human Services for understanding the importance of quality health care and approving the Community Health Center of Richmond's application for this critically-needed designation," added Schumer.

On top of the $566,667 in initial grants, the Community Health Center of Richmond will now be eligible to apply for additional, annual Federal funding under the guidelines of the Affordable Care Act to further expand their services for the surrounding community.

The Community Health Center of Richmond is a nonprofit, family health center that provides quality health care, preventive care and disease management throughout New York City.
