As health systems join together and insurance payers consolidate, size must answer size, Davis said, a kind of Wal-Mart-ization of health care that could also lead to less local control.\n\nTwo of the biggest impacts on University\u2019s finances are coming from two sweeping federal laws \u2013 the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nHITECH requires hospitals to use electronic medical records to share data between facilities, or face penalties. But implementing its electronic medical record, mainly through the Epic system, has so far cost University more than $50 million, Davis said. And it is looking at potentially $30 million in additional upgrades, which drove University to begin exploring a shared services contract with Novant Health Inc., of Charlotte, N.C.\n\nWith $3.4 billion in net patient revenues and relationships with 20 facilities, they can take advantage of economies of scale, Davis said.\n\n\u201cWhen Novant, which has 20 hospitals, does an upgrade on their Epic system, which takes a lot of work, they spread that cost over 20 hospitals,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I do that same upgrade, I spread it over one. If I can be the 21st hospital that (cost) gets spread over, then everybody\u2019s costs goes down. That\u2019s the kind of thinking we are going to have to do if we are going to survive in the future.\u201d\n\nThat becomes increasingly important in light of funding reductions.\n\nWhat at first appeared to be a $17 million cut in Medicare funding is now looking like $27 million, Davis said. Hospitals agreed to $155 billion in cuts to help fund the Affordable Care Act, with the expectation that many more people would be covered by insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplaces and through an expansion of Medicaid. But the U.S. Supreme Court decision made Medicaid expansion optional for states, and Georgia refused.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get that upside we were supposed to get by having everybody insured,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a bad position to be in.\u201d\n\nThe Georgia Budget and Policy Institute estimated that Medicaid expansion would provide an additional $33.2 billion in federal funding over 10 years at a cost of $2.1 billion to the state. But a Georgia State University study said when economic impact and additional tax revenue is factored in, expansion would cost much less at a little more than $350 million.\n\nIt would also cover 400,000 Georgians who will not be eligible for subsidies in the federal exchanges, the institute said, because they are below the federal poverty level. The act barred them for fear states would simply dump their Medicaid population on the exchanges. They, in turn, are exempted from the individual mandate to have health insurance.\n\nEven when people do get insurance through the Affordable Care Act, it will likely be the cheapest monthly plans \u2013 those with high deductibles and reduced reimbursement for providers, he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re still going to absorb a substantial part of the bill from those plans,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s a far cry from traditional commercial insurance reimbursement, let\u2019s put it that way.\u201d\n\nAll of this will put additional pressure on hospitals to cut costs, and most have already found what savings they could in supplies and personnel while still trying to maintain good care, Davis said.\n\n\u201cThat low-hanging fruit has been pretty well harvested,\u201d he said.\n\nThat means turning to what Davis called the \u201cfixed cost\u201d side of the business, in Information Technology, human resources and other infrastructure costs. Teaming up with larger organizations allows those costs to be spread out.\n\nUniversity recently did just that with McDuffie Regional Medical Center, which transferred a lot of \u201coverhead\u201d services (like billing) to University, allowing it to break even, Davis said. Exploring a shared services contract with Novant allows University to dosomething similar.\n\n\u201cThat was a way for us to remain independent, but hopefully leverage some of their scale to reduce fixed costs for the most part,\u201d Davis said.\n\nMany recent hospital mergers have been in the $3 billion to $4 billion range and it might take being part of an organization that large to compete, he said.\n\nInsurers may demand it.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield, when it was putting together its new insurance products for the Augusta area, didn\u2019t even talk to University, Davis said. But Novant negotiated with them market by market, he said. Size will matter, Davis added.\n\n\u201cI think you almost have to have a multistate regional kind of presence to get that seat at the table,\u201d he said. There are only about five insurance companies that matter in the Augusta market and those may be consolidating as well, Davis said.\n\n\u201cAs they consolidate, the folks that are contracting with them better be consolidating as well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take that to make the playing field fair. If they\u2019re big, they don\u2019t really want to go market by market and make all of these little negotiations when they can get a single-signature contract for a multistate deal. That\u2019s a different world than we are used to.\u201d\n\nAnd that might move decision making farther away, Davis said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure people in Augusta are going to be making those network decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe people in Georgia aren\u2019t making those decisions. It could be someone as far away as California is going to decide who is going to serve the patients in Augusta.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Health, Metro, Latest News, Tom Corwin", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "Many of the recent hospital mergers have been in the $3 billion to $4 billion range and it might take being part of an organization that large to compete, said Jim Davis, the CEO of University Hospital.", "title": "University Hospital sees banding together for survival", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/health/2013-11-09/university-hospital-sees-banding-together-survival", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda59a\"", "article_summary": "But implementing its electronic medical record, mainly through the Epic system, has so far cost University more than $50 million, Davis said.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield, when it was putting together its new insurance products for the Augusta area, didn\u2019t even talk to University, Davis said.\nThey, in turn, are exempted from the individual mandate to have health insurance.\nIf I can be the 21st hospital that (cost) gets spread over, then everybody\u2019s costs goes down.\nUniversity recently did just that with McDuffie Regional Medical Center, which transferred a lot of \u201coverhead\u201d services (like billing) to University, allowing it to break even, Davis said."}
