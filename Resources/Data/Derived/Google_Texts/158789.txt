“It’s not as Fifty Shades of Grey as people want it to be,” Jenna Bush Hager said in a phone interview on NBC’s “Today” show on Friday. “My husband and I did have our first kiss on the White House roof,” she said, calling the moment, “pretty innocent but really lovely.” She added later to laughs, “There was not heavy petting.”

The 33-year-old mom and “Today” special correspondent was asked by a viewer on Bravo’s “Watch What Happens Live” earlier this week, if she had ever “fooled around” at the White House. Bush Hager replied, “Maybe there was a little hanky-panky. There was maybe a kiss on the roof.”

On Friday, Bush Hager declared that she “single-handedly brought back the word ‘hanky-panky.’ ” When asked by “Today” co-host Carson Daly if the sniper-bearing Secret Service agents on the roof interfered with the kissing session, Bush Hager said, “There was probably no privacy — but in our minds, we were the only two people there.”
