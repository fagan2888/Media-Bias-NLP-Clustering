The fear of boycotts, protests and bad word of mouth that surrounded films such as \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d and \u201cThe Passion\u201d made studios wary of devoting time and money to projects that might offend the faithful and result in scandal.\n\nThat fear extended to network television, where direct revenue from advertisement is easily threatened by controversy, and only syrupy shows with the gentlest of touches (\u201cTouched by an Angel\u201d, \u201cHighway to Heaven\u201d) survived for long runs.\n\nPHOTOS: TOP TEN MOVIE PORTRAYALS OF JESUS\n\nYet, as magazine editors and TV programmers well know, the truth is that Jesus, though he may not have been a capitalist, really sells. The ultimate financial success of \u201cThe Passion\u201d and the ratings bonanza that greeted The History Channel\u2019s ten-hour \u201cThe Bible\u201d miniseries made it clear that there is a way to tap into religious stories that can both appeal to the masses and minimize the risk of offending the faithful. It\u2019s even given a few studios the courage to flirt with sacrilege.\n\nHollywood and TV producers have a slew of religious-themed projects in development. It was reported this week that Reza Aslan\u2019s controversial novel \u201cZealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\u201d has been optioned by Lionsgate productions. Given the firestorm that greeted the novel\u2019s release early this year, it\u2019s likely that any resulting movie will be the most controversial of the bunch.\n\nSome of the other productions about Jesus include a look at the missing years of Jesus\u2019s life. The History Channel, following on its miniseries success from earlier this year, is planning a series called Jesus: \u201cThe Lost Years\u201d that will tell the story of a young Jesus beginning his career as an exorcist in the Roman occupied Holy Land. (None of the four Christian Gospels give any indication of what Jesus did between the ages of 12 and 30). The show will be based on the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas (an early Christian text that was rejected by the church for being\u2026well mostly just silly.)\n\nThis joins October\u2019s announcement that \u201cWaterworld\u201d director Kevin Reynolds would be producing a film called \u201cThe Resurrection,\u201d centered on a Roman centurion given the task of investigating rumors of a risen Christ in 1st Century Judea. The \u201cCSI: Holy Land\u201d jokes have already started pouring in.\n\nAlso coming down the line are the Ridley Scott directed \u201cExodus,\u201d with Christian Bale and Aaron Paul cast as Moses and Joshua respectively; Darren Aronofsky\u2019s \u201cNoah\u201d; Paul Verhoeven\u2019s \u201cJesus of Nazareth\u201d (which will be explicitly non-faith based); a remake of \u201cBen-Hur\u201d (in which Jesus has a small but pivotal role); a Warner Bros. film centered on Pontius Pilate; and, of course, the inevitable follow up to \u201cThe Bible\u201d focusing exclusively on the life of Christ.\n\nIn many ways these new projects fit the mold of the current Hollywood insistence of only developing projects from properties with existing fan bases, leading to the glut of superhero movies, Sherlock Holmes reboots and odd marginalia like \u201cAbraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\u201d or television\u2019s \u201cDa Vinci\u2019s Demons.\u201d But by using religious figures they do risk walking into a minefield. Certainly, any portrayal of Jesus that flirts with self-doubt or (gasp) sexual tension will be met by a vocal outcry from those that consider this blasphemous.\n\nThe Superman comparison may be more than obvious, but heaven help the poor soul who tries to make Mary Magdalene into Lois Lane. And let\u2019s just hope no one in Hollywood gets the bright idea to produce \u201cThe Prophet Mohammed: Werewolf Slayer.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Jesus may not have been a capitalist, but Hollywood is betting that Jesus will sell.", "title": "Jesus Is Coming Back...to Your Screen", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/15/Jesus-Coming-Backto-Your-Screen", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12142013_Jesus.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/15/Jesus-Coming-Backto-Your-Screen", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12142013_Jesus.jpeg", "creator": "@DrMonkeyPHD", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Jesus may not have been a capitalist, but Hollywood is betting that Jesus will sell.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd59c5\"", "article_summary": "It was reported this week that Reza Aslan\u2019s controversial novel \u201cZealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\u201d has been optioned by Lionsgate productions.\n(None of the four Christian Gospels give any indication of what Jesus did between the ages of 12 and 30).\nSome of the other productions about Jesus include a look at the missing years of Jesus\u2019s life.\nPHOTOS: TOP TEN MOVIE PORTRAYALS OF JESUSYet, as magazine editors and TV programmers well know, the truth is that Jesus, though he may not have been a capitalist, really sells.\nCertainly, any portrayal of Jesus that flirts with self-doubt or (gasp) sexual tension will be met by a vocal outcry from those that consider this blasphemous."}
