She did not just write a blog post and leave it at that: She sent it to friends and family, asking them to forward it to others and to take action.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that she\u2019s so angelic,\u201d Ms. Day said. \u201cShe saw things and did what she could, whatever she could, however she could.\u201d\n\nMost news accounts focused on Mueller's humanitarian \"calling.\"\n\nCNN reported:\n\nMueller made it her life's work to help others. She graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2009, and worked with humanitarian groups in northern India, Israel and Palestinian territories, a family spokeswoman said.\n\n\"She had a quiet, calming presence. She was a free spirit, always standing up for those who were suffering and wanting to be their voice. ... Kayla's calling was to help those who were suffering, whether in her home in Prescott, or on the other side of the world,\" her aunts, Lori Lyon and Terri Crippes, said Tuesday.\n\nIn general, media reports on Mueller's faith \u2014 if that aspect of her life was explored at all \u2014 could be described as vague.\n\n\"Her letter feels almost spiritual but not religious to me, no mention of Jesus,\" said one Godbeat pro who was frustrated in attempts to track down information on Mueller's religion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is there a\u00a0holy ghost\u00a0in\u00a0media coverage of Kayla Mueller's life?\r\n\r\nThe 26-year-old American was killed while being held hostage by Islamic \r\nState extremists, her family and the White House confirmed Tuesday.\r\n\r\nIn a\u00a0letter released by her family\u00a0and\u00a0cited frequently in news reports,\r\n\u00a0Mueller referred to \"our creator\" and mentioned God five times.\r\n\r\nThe\u00a0Los Angeles Times\u00a0highlighted a portion of the letter:\r\n\r\n    \u201cBy God and by your prayers I have felt tenderly cradled in freefall.
