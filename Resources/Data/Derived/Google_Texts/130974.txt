In what could be termed as the positive benefits of medical awareness programs, more kids are getting insurance coverage through public programs in Utah.

According to a report of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the uninsured rate for children fell to 9.8 percent in 2012 from 12.4 percent in 2008.

As per the 22-page analysis of census data, about 1 in 10 children in the state remain uninsured, but more kids are getting coverage through public programs.

Experts believe the new Affordable Care Act or Obamacare, which took full effect in January, will accelerate this trend.

The health law applies more to adults than children. But the research shows that adults are more likely to sign up their kids for government-subsidized coverage. Nearly 73 percent of insured kids in Utah have private coverage that are mainly offered through a parent’s employer or insurance purchased by the family. This reflects a small number of kids, i.e.about 17.4 percent, are taking advantage of public options.

“This report provides an important baseline for measuring the effects of the Affordable Care Act on uninsured children over time and across states,” said Lynn Blewett, director of the State Health Access Data Assistance Center (SHADAC), which compiled the report.
