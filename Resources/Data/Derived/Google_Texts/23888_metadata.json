We appreciate everyone respecting our privacy at this time. We ask for your continued prayers.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Odom was found unconscious by brothel workers from an apparent drug overdose in Crystal, Nev. He was transferred to a Las Vegas hospital where members of the Kardashian-Jenner family and others like former teammate Kobe Bryant have met to be at his side.\n\nAccording to reports, estranged wife Khloe Kardashian is making medical decisions for Odom as they are still legally married.
