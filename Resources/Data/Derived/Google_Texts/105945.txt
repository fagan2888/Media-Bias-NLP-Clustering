Second District Congressman Brad Wenstrup toured Highland District Hospital Monday, Oct. 20.The congressman met with HDH CEO Jim Baer and other administrative executives regarding Ebola preparedness, the impact that Obamacare is having on the health-care profession and other legislative issues.

As a practicing physician, Wenstrup serves on the U.S. House Subcommittee on Health.

Wenstrup said he believes the administration needs to consider certain travel restrictions and implement a policy that safeguards U.S. citizens from those re-entering the country from areas affected by Ebola.

Wenstrup also joined Ohio’s congressional delegation in a letter to Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Thomas Frieden asking the CDC to provide “any and all necessary support to the state of Ohio in determining any potential exposure, identifying those most at risk and, if necessary, containing and treating anyone that may have come in contact with the Ebola virus.”

“As elected representatives of the people of Ohio, our primary concern is the health and safety of those we represent,” the congressional delegation said.
