President Barack Obama volunteered an executive order. Denis Leary offered to just co-write the whole damn thing with Colin Quinn and Chris Rock for the bargain price of $25 million if Stewart would stay put.\n\nBut alas, the day that we've been dreading since he announced his intention to leave back in February is here. Tonight is the final episode of The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.\n\nThe Emmy-winning Comedy Central institution will of course go on under the guidance of incoming host Trevor Noah, who is charming and brilliant and seems pretty funny. Meh. He'll be great. Whatever. We'll probably even watch and enjoy it.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "sailthru.contenttype": "news", "description": "Much as they did with David Letterman before he bid farewell to late-night TV, the guests have tr...", "title": "Jon Stewart Signs Off From The Daily Show Tonight: 10 Things We'll Miss the Most, Besides Everything", "og": {"site_name": "E!
