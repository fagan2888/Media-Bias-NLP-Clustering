Some customers notice it, point it out, have a laugh. Others don\u2019t. Still, it\u2019s as good a declaration of this particular bar\u2019s ethos as any\u2014and once in a while, when I sense intimations of aggression, if someone starts getting out of line, I point to it, smile, and repeat aloud what it says. It usually breaks the tension in the room. This is a good-natured, friendly place, this little neighborhood bar in a gentrifying but still relatively modest part of Brooklyn, in the fuzzy borderlands between Park Slope and Sunset Park near Green-Wood Cemetery. We don\u2019t want any trouble here. We want everyone\u2014and that includes you\u2014to make nice, to make friends, and have an easygoing, no-pressure $3 Miller High Life, $3 shot of Evan Williams good time.\n\nAnd the happy truth is: Most people here are nice. I love my job. In my four years behind this bar, only a few incidents have given me real grief, and those have been extreme, anomalous cases. Once, a raving madman, jacked up to his eyeballs on speed, sweating through his T-shirt, came in, ordered a shot of whiskey, didn\u2019t drink it, and proceeded to pace the length of the almost-empty bar enumerating, in a loosely coherent monologue, the many conspirators arrayed against him: The Bloods. The Crips. The Hollywood establishment. Old friends who\u2019d betrayed him. The Brooklyn Academy of Music. Then he became eerily still for a moment, as if finding the quiet center of his self-made storm, looked me right in the eye, and told me that he was the Angel of Death. \u201cYou were kind to me when I walked in,\u201d he said, \u201cand you will come to regret that kindness.\u201d Suddenly, it felt like a siege. It took a long, tense time to get him out of the bar. But he was wrong: I don\u2019t regret whatever kindness I showed him. That\u2019s what I expect of all bartenders, and what I wish for from all customers.\n\nLike many bartenders, I\u2019ve been propositioned from time to time in uncomfortable ways. I\u2019ve had to intervene more than once when male customers have bothered uninterested women customers. And, sure, sometimes I\u2019ve had to cut people off and give them the boot\u2014but nicely.\n\nThere are innumerable ways to be not nice in a bar, and mostly they\u2019re not extreme. They\u2019re about manners, assumptions, and ways of asserting power and control. It\u2019s everyday stuff: seemingly small, constant reminders that there are two kinds of New Yorkers: those who work in service, and those who do not.\n\nSO, WHAT ELSE DO YOU DO?\n\nI had a friend in college whose dad, an Italian immigrant, tended bar at a beloved old-school Italian restaurant on Manhattan\u2019s East Side for decades. Many of his regulars were character actors, some regularly seen in the films of John Cassavetes. (Maybe that\u2019s irrelevant, but I just like Falk and Gazzara and Cassavetes.) Anyway, the man, my friend\u2019s father, made a good enough living behind that bar to buy a nice house in a nice New Jersey suburb, and put two children through college.\n\nI like to think those actors tipped well. Something makes me suspect they did. But good tips alone don\u2019t pay mortgages and tuition. It may seem as though bartending is now a more respected office than ever before, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. As taste in drinks has become generally more sophisticated, tending bar may require special skills, and it may have acquired some cultural cachet, but my sense is, for all that, it used to be more professionalized, and pre-tip wages reflected that. Tending bar was once regarded as a real job, a way to make a living without having to make a living many different ways, as so many bartenders do now.\n\nI doubt that anyone ever asked my college friend\u2019s father what else he did, or what his real job is, but I\u2019ve come across very few bartenders now who haven\u2019t been interrogated in this way. Most weeks, I\u2019m asked at least once what else it is that I do. In the years since I returned to bartending after a long absence, I\u2019ve had some good luck as a writer. My memoir was published. I write a column for a newspaper. But I still bristle at the question, and hesitate before answering. Partly because I think \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d is never the most interesting question one might ask someone they\u2019ve only just met. Partly because I\u2019m as surprised as anybody that I wound up with another career that\u2019s working out OK, and that wasn\u2019t always true for me, and it hasn\u2019t been true for many other bartenders I know, irrespective of their talent and ambition, so it\u2019s a matter of solidarity. Partly because I think bartending is an excellent occupation in itself, and I\u2019m uneasy with the assumption that it can\u2019t possibly be enough. (Sometimes I do tell them that I\u2019m a minister, which is also true\u2014I was ordained as an Interfaith minister in 2002, and have served as a Red Cross chaplain\u2014even though I hardly consider it my job, because it generates pretty spectacular reactions, and because it pleases me to consider the ways in which bartending so often feels like a kind of ministry.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are two kinds of New Yorkers: Those who work in service, and those who do not.
