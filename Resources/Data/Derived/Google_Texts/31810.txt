When your dad is John Force, one of the best racers in the National Hot Rod Association, it’s pretty likely that you’re going to race. That was the case for all three of Force’s daughters.

On Saturday, his daughters Courtney and Brittany continue to race. Courtney faces off against her father in the Funny Car class and Brittany races in the Top Fuel Dragster category.

Courtney said she enjoys coming to Bandimere Speedway because of the unique challenge the elevation presents to the drivers and crew chiefs.

She’s visited the track as a competitor and a racer. But her favorite memory is hanging out in the grandstands with her animal crackers and lemonade watching her dad compete. It kicked off the start of her summer and was the first NHRA race out West.

Currently, Courtney sits sixth in the Funny Car standings.

“It’s been good for our Traxxas team,” Courtney said. “We’re staying in the top 10 in points. It’s definitely tough making it in the top 10 right now.”

On May 25, Courtney became the 100th woman to win an NHRA event. Courtney is among the many women thriving this year in the NHRA.
