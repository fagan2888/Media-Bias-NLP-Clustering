In response to the failures of Healthcare.gov, the Obama administration has called in a tech surge to fix the problems — in the form of Marge the crazy cat lady.

Timed to correspond with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius’ testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, YG Network has once again released a video poking fun at the failure of Healthcare.gov, this time comparing the website’s operators to a crazy cat lady named Marge.

“We may have gotten a little too technical with all the coding, so we decided to bring in a fresh, new, non-technical perspective,” the Healthcare.gov boss tells his employees.

Marge immediately tries to bond with her co-workers by telling them how much she likes memes and playing Candy Crush.

YG Network also released another video, called “Fired,” which shows the stress that the Healthcare.gov employees are experiencing while trying to fix the website.

The video series was started toward the end of October, along with a similar YouTube campaign by the Republican National Committee.
