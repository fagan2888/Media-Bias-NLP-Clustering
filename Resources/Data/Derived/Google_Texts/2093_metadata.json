Instead, costs have risen.\n\nThe price tag for housing, feeding and caring for a prisoner in California has climbed to almost $64,000 annually, up from $49,000 five years ago. Per prisoner, the state spends more than three times the amount it did 20 years ago when the population was a similar size.\n\nThis fiscal year, despite the recent decline in inmate numbers, California\u2019s corrections budget is one of the largest ever at $10.1 billion.\n\nThe state also spends an additional $1 billion annually outside the corrections budget to help counties implement sentencing alternatives and handle higher numbers of offenders serving time in local jails. Another $2.2 billion of state money is slated for county jail construction.\n\nThe cost per prisoner has swelled for a range of reasons. Some money-saving moves haven\u2019t happened, including shuttering the state\u2019s most dilapidated facility and ending out-of-state private prison contracts. Additionally, court rulings have required the state to spend billions improving medical care.\n\nThe biggest driver of higher costs, however, has been personnel. The state budgets for about the same number of positions as it did five years ago, when the state system housed nearly 30,000 more inmates.\n\n\u201cTheir numbers go up, not down. There is no way that could be justified,\u201d state Sen. Jim Nielsen (R-Gerber). \u201cIt was a deceit and a fraud to everybody that we were going to save money in corrections. We have not.\u201d\n\nCOURT-ORDERED REDUCTIONS\n\nCalifornia\u2019s reforms are rooted in a 2011 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which found that the state\u2019s overcrowded prisons violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nAt the time, 20,000 inmates were sleeping on makeshift triple bunk beds set up in prison gymnasiums and day rooms. The court ordered California to reduce crowding from 200 percent of capacity to a more manageable 137.5 percent.\n\nTo comply with the mandate, Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown transferred responsibility for thousands of felons from the state to counties. Under the new initiative, known as realignment, certain kinds of felons would no longer be sentenced to state prisons but rather would serve their time in local jails or alternative programs. In turn, jails released - or didn\u2019t take in - thousands of inmates with less serious convictions.\n\nThe idea was part of a broadly embraced approach to reform aimed at keeping low-level criminals out of jails and prisons and addressing mental illness or addiction issues in less expensive and restrictive settings. Social reformers saw the shift as more effective and humane, while budget hawks approved of its potential for reducing costs, which Brown promised would drop by about $1.5 billion by 2015-16.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is finally getting its prison costs under control,\u201d Brown said in 2012, when he laid out the state's blueprint for change in a document titled, \u201cThe Future of California Corrections.\u201d\n\nInitially, the state seemed to deliver on its promise to reduce both the prison population and costs. The department eliminated triple bunk-beds and closed 15 contract facilities. Six months after realignment, the number of prisoners had dropped by 22,000.\n\nDuring those early months, the department froze hiring, reduced staff through attrition and cut programming, each initiative achieving savings. By late 2012, the budget had dropped by about $1 billion from two years earlier to $8.7 billion.\n\nBut the savings were short-lived. In years that followed, the economy improved, staff was added, the legislature voted to spend more on rehabilitation, and the courts required additional spending, said Matt Cate, who headed the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation from 2008 to 2012.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting phenomenon,\u201d said James Austin, president of JFA Institute, a criminal justice research group. \u201cThe prison population declined, but the budget continues to rise.\u201d\n\nRISING COSTS\n\nWhen asked why the corrections budget hasn\u2019t decreased, California officials often point to a court order to improve inmate medical care.\n\nIn 2013, responding to the mandate, the state opened a new medical facility in Stockton, called the California Healthcare Facility, designed for inmates needing long-term inpatient medical care and intensive mental health services. The facility costs approximately $295 million annually. The state has also faced increased costs for prescription medications, including $60.6 million this year for new Hepatitis C treatments.\n\nThe overall rise in the cost per prisoner, however, has been driven far more by the salaries and benefits of employees.\n\nOne reason that personnel costs haven\u2019t fallen in step with the declining inmate population has been a change in the staffing formula. Prior to realignment, during more than two decades of swelling inmate numbers, the state staffed facilities using a simple formula: For every six new inmates, the department hired one new staff member.\n\nThe formula meant a huge increase in prison personnel during the 1980s and 1990s, especially in the ranks of correctional officers. If the same ratio had remained in place as the inmate population fell under realignment, some 4,000 jobs could have been eliminated. But the state worried that a sharp reduction in personnel could leave facilities understaffed.\n\nAs an alternative, the blueprint introduced a model that standardized staffing according to a facility\u2019s physical layout, with guards and other personnel assigned at a level deemed necessary to secure and operate facilities.\n\nSome saw the move to standardized staffing as a thinly disguised way to protect the jobs of unionized prison guards, who otherwise might have opposed the reforms.\n\n\u201cIf they got that, they wouldn\u2019t mount a campaign of opposition,\u201d said Dan Macallair, executive director of the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice. \u201cIt\u2019s what allowed Brown to move ahead with realignment.\u201d\n\nBut those who were at the table during the discussions, including current and former department officials and the guards\u2019 union, all insist that appeasing prison workers was not the reason for the shift away from the old, ratio-driven staffing model.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, we weren\u2019t carrying [the union\u2019s] water,\u201d said then-corrections secretary Cate. \u201cWe were trying to run an appropriate system under federal court oversight, which means you\u2019ve got a lot of things that you have to accomplish with those people.\u201d\n\nThe JFA Institute\u2019s Austin notes that any promise of savings was overstated from the start. A correctional facility, he notes, is \u201clike an airplane. If that plane is full or empty, the cost is basically the same. It\u2019s the same thing with a prison.\u201d\n\nOTHER BENEFITS\n\nCalifornia prison reform advocates say that saving money was never the sole point of realignment, even if that was what helped sell Brown\u2019s plan.\n\nIn shifting responsibility for more convicts to counties and providing money to ease the transition, the state also hoped to spur new approaches to sentencing, reformers note, including flash incarcerations, probation supervision, jail programs, supportive housing and job training.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about realignment, in some ways it was to save money. But all of us working on the bill itself \u2026 knew it couldn\u2019t possibly save money,\u201d said Joan Petersilia, a Stanford criminologist and strong supporter of prison reform.\n\nPrograms such as those aimed at reducing recidivism are expensive, Petersilia noted, but they have the potential to both save money and serve society in the long run. Initially, however, \u201cgood on-the-ground policies usually incur more costs,\u201d she said.\n\nBrown's office declined to comment for this story, referring questions to the corrections department.\n\nRecent CDC Secretary Jeffrey Beard, who retired last week, acknowledged that the savings haven't been exactly as promised in the blueprint. But he said that without the reforms the state might have had to spend billions building more prisons.\n\n\u201cHave we achieved the savings?\u201d asked Beard. \u201cIf we look at cost-avoidance, yes, we have achieved it.\u201d\n\n(Corrects paragraphs 32 and 33 spelling of Stanford criminologist's last name to Petersilia instead of Petrels, corrects paragraphs 17 and 28 spelling to Cate instead of Cater, corrects paragraph 26 to Macallair instead of Mac all air)\n\n(Reporting by Robin Respaut; Editing by Sue Horton)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - In 2012, under court order to reduce prison overcrowding, Ca", "title": "California prison reforms have reduced inmate numbers, not costs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/06/California-prison-reforms-have-reduced-inmate-numbers-not-costs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/california-prison-budget_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/06/California-prison-reforms-have-reduced-inmate-numbers-not-costs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/california-prison-budget_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - In 2012, under court order to reduce prison overcrowding, Ca", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Another $2.2 billion of state money is slated for county jail construction.\n\u201cCalifornia is finally getting its prison costs under control,\u201d Brown said in 2012, when he laid out the state's blueprint for change in a document titled, \u201cThe Future of California Corrections.\u201dInitially, the state seemed to deliver on its promise to reduce both the prison population and costs.\n\u201cThe prison population declined, but the budget continues to rise.\u201dRISING COSTSWhen asked why the corrections budget hasn\u2019t decreased, California officials often point to a court order to improve inmate medical care.\nThis fiscal year, despite the recent decline in inmate numbers, California\u2019s corrections budget is one of the largest ever at $10.1 billion.\nThe court ordered California to reduce crowding from 200 percent of capacity to a more manageable 137.5 percent."}
