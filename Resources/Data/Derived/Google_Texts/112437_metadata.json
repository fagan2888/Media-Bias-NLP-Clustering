In a blog post Tuesday, the company announced two changes: a \u201cLaunch Now\u201d feature and \u201cdramatically simplified rules.\u201d\n\n\u201cGosnell\u201d filmmakers say it\u2019s a big win for diversity of opinion.\n\nEarlier this year, filmmakers Phelim McAleer and Ann McElhinney pulled their project from Kickstarter after a dispute over language describing convicted killer Kermit Gosnell.\n\nIn May 2013, Gosnell was found guilty of murder for the deaths of babies at his Philadelphia clinic. The producers said their film will document his 40-year career in the abortion business, a period when thousands of babies likely died on his watch. Gosnell is now serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.\n\nTo launch their fundraising campaign, Kickstarter insisted McAleer and McElhinney modify or remove language such as \u201c1000s of babies stabbed to death\u201d and \u201c1000s of babies murdered,\u201d which was not in line with \u201cthe spirit\u201d of their community guidelines.\n\nThe filmmakers rejected this request, telling The Daily Signal it was an attempt to \u201ccensor\u201d their project. Instead, McAleer and McElhinney turned to Indiegogo, a similar crowdsourcing website, to raise the necessary funds. There, they set a record for the largest non-celebrity film on any crowdfunding website.\n\nShortly after, Kickstarter was accused of interfering with the pro-life film \u201cStolen Moments\u201d by activist Jason Vaughn. Kickstarter approved a pro-abortion documentary by Martha Shane and Lana Wilson called \u201cAfter Tiller,\u201d which goes inside the lives of the last four late-term abortion doctors in America.\n\nKickstarter\u2019s updated rules and regulations include a \u201cLaunch Now\u201d feature, granting creators the option to \u201claunch your project whenever you\u2019re ready, or get feedback from one of our Community Managers first.\u201d McAleer said he\u2019s \u201cglad that they got the message that people won\u2019t stand for censorship.\u201d\n\nWhile Kickstarter told The Daily Signal the changes \u201cwere in discussion many months prior\u201d to the Gosnell project, McAleer argued, \u201cthis is a direct response to the Gosnell controversy and I wish they had acknowledged that in their public statements. I wish they said, \u2018We messed up and we had a look at our procedures.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs for whether or not he\u2019ll tap Kickstarter for future campaigns, McAleer said, \u201cI won\u2019t be using Kickstarter again because of their instinctive urge to censor and their unwillingness to admit mistakes. That\u2019s not the kind of company I want to work with.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After stirring controversy over its handling of the movie \u201cGosnell,\u201d crowdsourcing website Kickstarter is altering its policies.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "After stirring controversy over its handling of the movie \u201cGosnell,\u201d crowdsourcing website Kickstarter is altering its policies.", "title": "'Gosnell' Filmmaker Glad Kickstarter 'Got the Message'", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014-06-05-GosnellKickstarter_Harkness1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1unv9f4"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "After stirring controversy over its handling of the movie \u201cGosnell,\u201d crowdsourcing website Kickstarter is altering its policies.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014-06-05-GosnellKickstarter_Harkness1.jpg"}, "title": "'Gosnell' Filmmaker Glad Kickstarter 'Got the Message'", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2014-06-05T17:56:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcabe0\"", "article_summary": "Earlier this year, filmmakers Phelim McAleer and Ann McElhinney pulled their project from Kickstarter after a dispute over language describing convicted killer Kermit Gosnell.\nAfter stirring controversy over its handling of the movie \u201cGosnell,\u201d crowdsourcing website Kickstarter is altering its policies.\nIn May 2013, Gosnell was found guilty of murder for the deaths of babies at his Philadelphia clinic.\nShortly after, Kickstarter was accused of interfering with the pro-life film \u201cStolen Moments\u201d by activist Jason Vaughn.\nInstead, McAleer and McElhinney turned to Indiegogo, a similar crowdsourcing website, to raise the necessary funds."}
