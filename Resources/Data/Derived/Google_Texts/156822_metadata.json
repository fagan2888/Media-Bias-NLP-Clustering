Scott Walker has rejected a labor group\u2019s effort to increase the state\u2019s $7.25 an hour minimum wage.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reports that a coalition led by the group Wisconsin Jobs Now had seized on a provision in Wisconsin law which states that the minimum wage must be a \u201cliving wage\u201d \u2013 defined as \u201creasonable comfort, reasonable physical well-being, decency and moral well-being.\u201d However, the Journal-Sentinel noted, state law also allows governors to weigh such factors as the wage\u2019s impact on the labor market. (Studies show that state increases in the minimum wage don\u2019t harm job growth.)\n\nCiting the living wage provision, the coalition last month urged the Walker administration\u2019s labor department to raise the state\u2019s minimum wage. In rebuffing the effort, the Walker administration isn\u2019t just citing the other factors a governor is allowed to consider \u2013 it\u2019s actually asserting that $7.25 an hour is a living wage.\n\nResponding to the coalition\u2019s effort in a letter Monday, Robert Rodriguez of the Department of Workforce Development wrote, \u201cThe department has determined that there is no reasonable cause to believe that the wages paid to the complainants are not a living wage.\u201d\n\nAs ThinkProgress\u2019 Bryce Covert notes, an MIT study has found that a living wage for a single parent in Madison, Wisconsin would be $21.17 per hour.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The governor's administration rejects effort to raise the minimum wage, saying $7.25 is enough", "title": "\u201cVoters will remember this\u201d: Scott Walker administration says $7.25 an hour is a \u201cliving wage\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The governor's administration rejects effort to raise the minimum wage, saying $7.25 is enough", "title": "\u201cVoters will remember this\u201d: Scott Walker administration says $7.25 an hour is a \u201cliving wage\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/08/voters_will_remember_this_walker_administration_says_7_25_an_hour_is_a_living_wage/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/scott_walker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The governor's administration rejects effort to raise the minimum wage, saying $7.25 is enough", "title": "\u201cVoters will remember this\u201d: Scott Walker administration says $7.25 an hour is a \u201cliving wage\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/scott_walker.jpg", "creator": "@LukeBrinker", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Luke Brinker", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Dan Cantor, Labor, Labor movement, living wage, Mary Burke, Minimum wage, Scott Walker, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Wisconsin, Working Families Party", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Dan Cantor, Labor, Labor movement, living wage, Mary Burke, Minimum wage, Scott Walker, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Wisconsin, Working Families Party, Politics NewsWisconsin Gov.\nCiting the living wage provision, the coalition last month urged the Walker administration\u2019s labor department to raise the state\u2019s minimum wage.\nScott Walker has rejected a labor group\u2019s effort to increase the state\u2019s $7.25 an hour minimum wage.\nIn rebuffing the effort, the Walker administration isn\u2019t just citing the other factors a governor is allowed to consider \u2013 it\u2019s actually asserting that $7.25 an hour is a living wage.\n(Studies show that state increases in the minimum wage don\u2019t harm job growth.)"}
