The added coverage is for gender affirmation surgery (GAS), also known as gender reassignment surgery, in which some transgender individuals undergo procedures to modify their physical sex characteristics to match those traditionally associated with their transitioning identity.\n\nMIT previously extended this coverage to its employees under the MIT Traditional Health Plan and MIT Choice Plan in a change announced July 30, 2013. At that time, the change did not apply to MIT\u2019s coverage for students.\n\nBoth employee and student plans continue to cover visits with MIT providers, blood tests, and hormone therapy as part of transgender health care according to the website.\n\nAccording to Abigail Francis, director of LGBT services at MIT, and Lucy Walsh, director of finance for MIT Medical, this change is the result of extended advocacy by several groups, including LBGT@MIT, a program under MIT\u2019s Division of Student Life and part of the Student Activities Office according to its website.\n\n\u201c[LBGT@MIT] has worked with students and with MIT Medical staff for several years to identify gender-affirming, gender-inclusive, and trans*-friendly resources, professional development, and campus-wide education and awareness-raising opportunities,\u201d Walsh and Francis wrote in an email to The Tech.\n\nThey said that LBGT@MIT collaborated with the MIT Trans Care team and student advocates to push for expanded coverage.\n\nWalsh and Francis said that while the Employee Benefits Oversight Committee was able to extend the coverage to MIT employees last summer, a Student and Affiliate Health Insurance Advisory Committee was still being formed to investigate the effects of the Affordable Care Act on student insurance plans at the time, causing the delay in the availability of the benefit for students.\n\n\u201cSince there is a cost associated with adding any new coverage, it was appropriate for this decision to be considered in context with the other benefit changes that need to be made to be in compliance with the Affordable Care Act. The first meeting of the new Committee was in November 2013,\u201d they wrote. The recommendation to add the benefit came in January and was approved by top administrators, effective Feb. 1.\n\nAccording to Walsh and Francis, \u201cThe Student Extended Insurance Plan is a Blue Cross Blue Shield Preferred Provider Organization, or PPO. Benefits will be determined based on the Blue Cross Blue Shield of MA established medical policy.\u201d Service providers contracted under Blue Cross will submit claims directly, whereas students may need to pay for services at non-contracted providers themselves and later seek reimbursement. Walsh and Francis said Claims and Members Services on the first floor of E23 could provide more information.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The MIT Medical Transgender Health FAQ website now lists a \u201cSurgery\u201d benefit of up to $50,000 per year as part of coverage available to transgender patients under the MIT Student Extended Insurance Plan.
