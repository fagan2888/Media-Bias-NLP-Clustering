For one, it\u2019s dehumanizing to be forced to wear a standard-issue hospital gown when what you\u2019d love to put on is your favorite pair of pajamas. The gowns are also demeaning (that open-back thing that leaves you exposed comes to mind) and let\u2019s face it, they\u2019re unfashionable, which is not what you want when you\u2019re probably not looking your best and a surprising number of people are swinging by to bring you flowers and wish you well. It\u2019s just the cherry on top of the \u201cthis sucks\u201d sundae.\n\nRELATED: Should You Go to the ER?\n\nUntil, maybe now: More and more hospitals are starting to take comfort into consideration by dressing patients in (slightly) more dignified gowns, according to a report from Kaiser Health News. Hospitals are re-evaluating the gowns in an effort to boost patient reviews and therefore pad the bottom line. (Happy patients can mean more money because The Affordable Care Act is putting more pressure on The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to take patient satisfaction into account when deciding the size of Medicare payments hospitals get.)\n\nIn fact, the makeover has been in the works for years. The Cleveland Clinic\u2019s CEO met Diane von Furstenberg, creator of the iconic wrap dress, at a networking conference in 2007, leading to the reveal of designer patient gowns at the hospital\u2019s Patient Experience Summit in 2010.\n\nRELATED: 22 Ways to Help a Friend With Breast Cancer\n\nThe Von Furstenberg creation, which debuted at the clinic in 2013, is reversible with a front and back V-neck and pockets. The fabric was softer and featured a bold print pattern featuring the Cleveland Clinic logo, and, yes, there\u2019s butt coverage! \u201cPeople felt much more comfortable in the new design, not just physically but emotionally,\u201d Adrienne Boissy, chief experience officer at the Cleveland Clinic, told Kaiser Health News.\n\nNow other hospitals are taking a crack at it. The Detroit-based Henry Ford Health System gave hospital gowns the Project Runway treatment last fall, after asking students at the city\u2019s College for Creative Studies to come up with solutions. In November, the institute unveiled the new gowns, made of a warm cotton blend that wrap around the body like a robe. When the institute tested the designs, they reportedly discovered that patient satisfaction scores had increased.\n\nBut giving a do-over to the original design can be challenging, to say the least. While patients need to be comfortable, health care workers need to have easy access during exams (translation: the gown needs to open and close easily).\n\nRELATED: 10 Surprising Health Benefits of Being a Woman\n\nWhat\u2019s more, gowns need to be easily mass-manufactured, as well as laundered. When Valley Hospital of Ridgewood, New Jersey, switched to pajamas and gowns that offered more coverage, they saw their operating costs go up by $70,000 per year because the new garments cost more to purchase and to clean, Kaiser Health News reported.\n\nAnd money isn\u2019t the only thing that matters: Patients and MDs seem to have very different ideas on what a patient should wear, according to Todd Lee, MD, an assistant professor of medicine at McGill University. Dr. Lee co-authored a 2014 study in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine that examined the importance of the gowns and whether patients might be happier wearing pants, instead of (or along with) gowns.\n\n\u201cThere are some [physicians] who say, \u2018Of course we should be doing this, and I never really thought about it, and I can see how it\u2019s important,'\u201d Dr. Lee said in a recent interview with ACP Hospitalist. \u201cAnd then there\u2019s another subgroup of physicians who are concerned that potentially important clinical findings could be missed, or that in more significantly ill patients, there could be barriers to managing them during critical illness if they were wearing more substantial attire.\u201d\n\nWhile the experts are still hashing that out, may we suggest some tweaks the hospital menu, as well?\n\nRELATED: Best and Worst Foods To Eat When You\u2019re Sick", "article_metadata": {"Content-Source": "healthcom", "description": "This may seem like a small complaint for patients to hate on, all things considered, but there's no wonder hospital gowns seem to be universally reviled.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Health News / Tips & Trends / Celebrity Health", "description": "This may seem like a small complaint for patients to hate on, all things considered, but there\u2019s no wonder hospital gowns seem to be universally reviled.", "title": "Why More Hospitals Are Saying Goodbye to Old-School Gowns", "url": "http://news.health.com/2015/04/09/are-designer-gowns-coming-to-a-hospital-near-you-maybe/", "image": {"width": 599, "identifier": "https://healthnewsandviews.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/dvf-hospital-gown.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://healthnewsandviews.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/dvf-hospital-gown.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@goodhealth", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "search_title": "Why More Hospitals Are Saying Goodbye to Old-School Gowns", "msapplication-tooltip": "Health's blog features breaking news, celebrity tips, exercise videos, and more!
