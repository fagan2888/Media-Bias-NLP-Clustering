We've been watching for several years the new terminal being built at the now Eisenhower National Airport. An open house Saturday afternoon gave the general public their first opportunity to look inside.

Thousands of visitors were bussed from outlying parking lots to the new terminal. Even as they first stepped inside the spacious ticketing area their comments reflected how impressed they are with the building.

"Very modern," says Sharon Parry. "Big and beautiful," says Richard Wells.

Brad Goetz says, "This is fantastic. It's so bright and open and just, you know, modern. Really cool."

Director of Airports for the Wichita Airport Authority, Victor White, says, "The exciting thing about this new building is there's not just one thing that is different and great. Every person who comes in has a different thing that they focus on as their favorite thing, their favorite feature."

So what impresses the guests depends on who you ask. For some it's the it's the glass jet-ways connecting the building with the planes. Others focused on the wing-like art. Others still like the high ceilings, glass fa√ßade or more concessions.

Kim Clawson says, "This looks like a real airport, one of the ones we travel to in New York, in Dallas. Looks really nice. Very impressed, proud."

Gayle Garrett says, "Very spacious, very up to date. Looks nice just like some of the other cities. Now we can be very proud of our airport. I think it looks very comfortable. It looks very spacious. It shows that we do have class. And we are the Air Capital and it's reflected in some of the art work and structures we have here."

It was evident to everyone there's still work to be done to get the building ready for departures and arrivals. But Airport Director White believes it'll be ready for the first passengers in late May. He's not ready to give an exact date yet.
