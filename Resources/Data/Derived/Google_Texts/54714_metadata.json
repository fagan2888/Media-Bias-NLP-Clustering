That doesn't mean we shouldn't do our business in the legislative branch,\u201d said Rep. Adrian Smith, a Nebraska Republican who introduced the House version of the resolution.\n\nDespite the certain veto, next week's debate on the resolution \u201chelps establish the record and bring the issue to the forefront,\u201d said Smith.\n\nThe WOTUS measure, which is expected on the House floor on Wednesday, is one of a series of anti-regulation bills that House Republicans are forcing votes on this month.\n\nThis week, the House voted to repeal Obamacare and passed a bill that would set up a commission to make recommendations on what it considers obsolete or unnecessary regulations that should be eliminated. Another bill the House passed is aimed at curbing the development of consent decrees and settlement agreements that lead to new regulations.\n\n\u201c2016 is about going on offense on ideas,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said as he opened his weekly news conference on Thursday.\n\nWatching for news on the Clean Water Act?

That legislation stalled in the Senate when supporters failed to get the 60 votes necessary to overcome a Democratic filibuster.\n\nThe disapproval resolution, which would simply kill the WOTUS rule, required only a simple majority to pass the Senate.\n\nThe WOTUS rule, which took effect in August, is supposed to clarify what streams, ponds, wetlands, ditches and other features are regulated under the Clean Water Act. But courts have blocked the rule's enforcement nationwide while legal challenges to it are considered.\n\n#30", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "agri-pulse.com,agriculture,farming,farmpolicy, WOTUS, waters of the United States, Clean Water Act, EPA, Army Corps of Engineers, Adrian Smith", "google-site-verification": "B3B-XLA-wsSPpTBjSFlO17UaogaI_3Kz3jFi0wvRW_8", "description": "The House will vote next week to kill the Obama administration s  waters of the United States  rule, as Republican leaders seek to make a case to voters for electing a Republican presidency.", "pubdate": 20160107}, "article_summary": "The disapproval resolution, which would simply kill the WOTUS rule, required only a simple majority to pass the Senate.\nHouse to vote to kill WOTUS ruleBy Philip Brasher\u00a9 Copyright Agri-Pulse Communications, Inc.WASHINGTON, Jan. 7, 2016 - The House will vote next week on whether to kill the Obama administration's \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d rule, as GOP leaders seek to make a case to voters for electing a Republican president.\nThe WOTUS rule, which took effect in August, is supposed to clarify what streams, ponds, wetlands, ditches and other features are regulated under the Clean Water Act.\nThe disapproval resolution passed the Senate in November, 53-44, well short of the two-thirds majority necessary to overturn a certain presidential veto.\nAnother bill the House passed is aimed at curbing the development of consent decrees and settlement agreements that lead to new regulations."}
