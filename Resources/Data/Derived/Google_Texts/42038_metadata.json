And they want to take advantage of new marketing opportunities that come with being GMO-free. That\u2019s why they\u2019re backing Measure P, a local measure that would prohibit growing genetically modified crops in Humboldt County.\n\n\u201cThis is a growing economy. And we think we should go with it and get behind that movement as much as possible,\u201d says Schaser, spokesman for the Yes on Measure P campaign.\n\nTwo years ago, statewide Proposition 37 would have required labeling of foods containing genetically modified organisms \u2013 but it failed by a slim margin. That measure had wide support in Humboldt County, though, and on Nov. 4 residents will vote on whether to ban the production of GMO crops in their region.\n\nA scientific debate over the safety of GMOs hasn\u2019t really come up here. Disputes have centered on farmers\u2019 rights. Organic farmers are concerned about cross-pollination from neighboring farms that grow genetically modified crops. They want to prevent contamination.\n\n\u201cIf someone within 2 miles of me plants a GMO variety of apples, the way the bees fly, it\u2019s beyond my control. It\u2019d get GMO pollen in my apple flowers,\u201d says Clif Clendenen, owner of Clendenen\u2019s Cider Works, an organic apple farm in Fortuna.\n\n\u201cSecondarily, many of my customers don\u2019t want GMOs in their food,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo there\u2019s a marketing reason.\u201d\n\nBordering counties Mendocino and Trinity are already GMO-free. Supporters of Measure P say adding Humboldt could create an economic corridor that can be used to market products from the region to the Bay Area and other parts of California.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking from an economic perspective, we can compete with the inland valley,\u201d says Schaser.\n\nThe Yes on P campaign raised just $40,000, enough to make a radio ad and a bunch of posters. Schaser says they were expecting to get crushed by a No campaign sponsored by GMO seed companies like Monsanto and Syngenta. But those corporations ignored Measure P and instead invested in blocking statewide GMO labeling propositions in Colorado and Oregon.\n\nBut even though there\u2019s no official campaign against Measure P, there are still farmers that plan to vote no, even organic farmers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tool they\u2019re taking out of our toolbox that we can\u2019t use anymore,\u201d says John Vovoda, a dairy farmer in Ferndale.\n\nHis farm is organic now \u2014 he ships 6,000 gallons of organic milk every day that shows up on store shelves throughout California. But his operation used to be conventional. He used to grow acres of GMO corn to feed his cows.\n\n\u201cThe point is, if my children want to go back to conventional, now they won\u2019t be able to do it,\u201d he says, nodding toward his son, Robert, who lives and works with him on the dairy farm.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a small family farm, you want to spend more of your time with your animals,\u201d says Robert, as a herd of cows grazes in the pasture behind him. \u201cNow we spend more of our time making sure we\u2019re in the office, doing paperwork to make sure we\u2019re in compliance with all the regulations. Measure P is just another regulation.\u201d\n\nThe senior Vovoda says, when it comes down to it, it\u2019s just not right telling farmers what they can and can\u2019t plant.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to stand here and look at my neighbors that are conventional and say, \u2018Hey, it\u2019s illegal, and I\u2019m going to turn you in for what you\u2019re doing,\u2019 \u201d Vovoda says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Organic farmers worry about cross-pollination from neighbors that grow genetically modified crops.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Humboldt County to Vote on Banning GMO Production\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/2014\\/11\\/03\\/humboldt-county-to-vote-on-banning-gmo-production\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-03 07:00:25\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-11-03 14:29:31\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":10346333,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Humboldt County\"],\"categories\":[\"Environment\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/10\\/2014\\/11\\/vovoda1440.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "KQED News", "description": "Organic farmers worry about cross-pollination from neighbors that grow genetically modified crops.", "title": "Humboldt County to Vote on Banning GMO Production", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2014/11/03/humboldt-county-to-vote-on-banning-gmo-production/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2014/11/yesonp-400x300.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqednews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "humboldt county", "google-site-verification": "Oam-TnlJjUP-cg8UEyR3-KcLp8_-WTy6_dBaSws1ADA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb27d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOrganic, organic, organic,\u201d says Bill Schaser, a retired teacher and loyal customer.\nThat\u2019s why they\u2019re backing Measure P, a local measure that would prohibit growing genetically modified crops in Humboldt County.\nBut even though there\u2019s no official campaign against Measure P, there are still farmers that plan to vote no, even organic farmers.\nThat measure had wide support in Humboldt County, though, and on Nov. 4 residents will vote on whether to ban the production of GMO crops in their region.\nBut those corporations ignored Measure P and instead invested in blocking statewide GMO labeling propositions in Colorado and Oregon."}
