Rhodes admitted (really it was more of a boast) to having sold the nuclear deal with Iran by the expedient of lying.\n\nThe unintentionally damning profile--the author doesn't seem to have an inkling that the thirtysomething former fiction writer who has a \"mind meld\" with the president, is a jerk-- evoked this highly unusual headline on a quick comment from Tom Ricks, the former Washington Post reporter and respected authority on military affairs:\n\nA Stunning Profile of Ben Rhodes, the A--hole Who Is the President's Foreign Policy Guru\n\nA two-time Obama voter, Ricks offered these key insights:\n\nPerhaps the key sentence is this: \u201cHis lack of conventional real-world experience of the kind that normally precedes responsibility for the fate of nations \u2014 like military or diplomatic service, or even a master\u2019s degree in international relations, rather than creative writing \u2014 is still startling.\u201d\n\n. . .\n\nI expect cynicism in Washington. But it usually is combined with a lot of knowledge \u2014 as with, say, Henry Kissinger. To be cynical and ignorant and to spin those two things into a virtue? That\u2019s industrial-strength hubris. Kind of like what got us into Iraq, in fact.\n\nRhodes and others around Obama keep on talking about doing all this novel thinking, playing from a new playbook, bucking the establishment thinking. But if that is the case, why have they given so much foreign policy power to two career hacks who never have had an original thought? I mean, of course, Joe Biden and John Kerry. I guess the answer can only be that those two are puppets, and (as in Biden\u2019s case) are given losing propositions like Iraq to handle.\n\nIn an item headlined \"The Runt of Rhodes,\" Scott Johnson at Powerline points out that the two legacy items of the Obama years, ObamaCare and the Iran nuclear deal, were sold on lies:\n\nObamacare was built on an edifice of calculated lies. Some of us could see the propositions on which President Obama sold Obamacare as falsehoods at the time of the selling. Others have learned from bitter experience after the buying. President Obama and his team hold a low opinion of the intelligence of the American people. See, for example, the case of Jonathan Gruber. Having elected him president twice, we have done much to earn Obama\u2019s contempt.\n\n. . .\n\nWhat does Ben Rhodes know? He knows he\u2019s selling a bill of goods to fools and he knows how to sell to fools. Congratulations.\n\nOn this point, Rhodes\u2019s \u201cmind meld\u201d with Obama (discussed by the Obama officials interviewed by Samuels) is complete. Rhodes\u2019s knowledge and Obama\u2019s overlap perfectly.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t think for the president,\u201d Samuels observes, \u201cbut he knows what the president is thinking, which is a source of tremendous power.\u201d Samuels quotes Rhodes saying with a touch of bafflement, \u201cI don\u2019t know anymore where I begin and Obama ends.\u201d\n\nReferring to his brother, David Rhodes, the head of CBS News, Rhodes tells Samuels: \u201c[David] was like the kid who carried the briefcase to school. I actually didn\u2019t do that great in high school because I was drinking and smoking pot and hanging out in Central Park.\u201d So he\u2019s got that in common with Obama as well.\n\nIn addition to the \u201cknowledge\u201d he shares with Obama, Rhodes shares a set of attitudes. We know them well. Many of us had figured them out without undue difficulty during the 2008 campaign.\n\nAs Gordon Crovitz observes in the Wall Street Journal, Rhodes and Obama duped not only a willing media and the public but members on Obama's early foreign policy team:\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s serious foreign-policy advisers seem taken aback by what happened under their watch. Leon Panetta, Mr. Obama\u2019s former CIA chief and defense secretary, assured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Mr. Obama would never let the Iranians get the bomb. Mr. Samuels asked Mr. Panetta if he still thinks Mr. Obama would block Iran from going nuclear. \u201cWould I make that same assessment now?\u201d Mr. Panetta said. \u201cProbably not.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ambassador and Middle East negotiator Dennis Ross, a former Obama adviser, writes in Politico that shifts in U.S. foreign policy are driving former allies in the Middle East to embrace Vladimir Putin.\n\nAs the Middle East implodes and the world is less safe now than it was when Obama came to office, Hillary Clinton will run party on her foreign policy chops as a member of the Obama team. And she might win.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two-time Obama voter and military expert Tom Ricks: I expect cynnicism in Washington, but . . .", "author": "Charlotte Hays", "og": {"url": "http://iwf.org/blog/2800150/More-on-the-Colossal-Lies-of-Rhodes", "image": "http://i1202.photobucket.com/albums/bb366/IWF11/Blog%20photos/iStock_000056182020_Large_zps9hduivzt.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Two-time Obama voter and military expert Tom Ricks: I expect cynnicism in Washington, but . . .", "title": "More on the Colossal Lies of Rhodes"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://iwf.org", "description": "Two-time Obama voter and military expert Tom Ricks: I expect cynnicism in Washington, but . . .", "title": "More on the Colossal Lies of Rhodes", "image": {"src": "http://i1202.photobucket.com/albums/bb366/IWF11/Blog%20photos/iStock_000056182020_Large_zps9hduivzt.jpg"}, "creator": "@iwf", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "More on the Colossal Lies of Rhodes", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Home / Blog / ArticleMore on the Colossal Lies of RhodesCharlotte HaysWe've already taken note of the astonishing New York Times magazine profile of Obama foreign policy guru Ben Rhodes.\nMr. Samuels asked Mr. Panetta if he still thinks Mr. Obama would block Iran from going nuclear.\nIn addition to the \u201cknowledge\u201d he shares with Obama, Rhodes shares a set of attitudes.\nSome of us could see the propositions on which President Obama sold Obamacare as falsehoods at the time of the selling.\nLeon Panetta, Mr. Obama\u2019s former CIA chief and defense secretary, assured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Mr. Obama would never let the Iranians get the bomb."}
