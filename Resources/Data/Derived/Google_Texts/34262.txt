As has become a post-holiday tradition, the Obama family visited a local bookstore in Washington to celebrate Small Business Saturday, an American shopping holiday held the day after Black Friday to celebrate and support local businesses.

President Barack Obama visited Upshur Street Books Saturday afternoon with his daughters Malia and Sasha, picking up nine books.

On the list:

"Purity: A Novel" by Jonathan Franzen "Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights: A Novel" by Salman Rushdie "Elske: A Novel of the Kingdom" by Cynthia Voigt "On Fortune's Wheel" by Cynthia Voigt "Jackaroo: A Novel of the Kingdom" by Cynthia Voigt "A Snicker of Magic" by Natalie Lloyd "Stargirl" by Jerry Spinelli "Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck, Book 8" by Jeff Kinney "Dork Diaries 1: Tales from a Not-So-Fabulous Life" by Rachel Renée Russell

After their book stop, they stopped for ice cream in a nearby D.C. neighborhood, visiting the popsicle shop Pleasant Pops.

This is the first time the Obamas have visited Upshur Street Books for their annual shopping trip. The last three years, the president and assorted family members have stopped by another D.C. bookstore, Politics and Prose.
