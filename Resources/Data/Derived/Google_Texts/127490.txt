Raptors junior also places fourth in 100 butterfly

FORT COLLINS — You know what happens when you assume.

Many in the state did just that, assuming Silver Creek's Tyler Lis would try and defend his 200-yard individual medley title at the Class 4A state meet.

Something told him otherwise.

The Raptors junior wanted to prove something to himself by swimming the 200 freestyle. He got the internal memo.

Lis, in his so-called "off event," finished in 1 minute, 42.13 seconds to earn a spot at the top of the podium and was nearly a second better than D'Evelyn senior Jake Sbarbaro.

"It was a hard choice between the 200 free and the 200 IM and ultimately I chose the free because I was just more excited about it," Lis said. "It is an event I don't swim as often and I was just excited to go out and see what I could do."

One day after getting touched at the wall by Thompson Valley freshman Liam Gately in the prelims, Lis used that moment as motivation Saturday at the Edora Pool Ice Center. He went out quick and 150 meters in had opened up a full body length on the field.

"I wanted to go a little faster and there was great competition, and I'll admit I was a little scared of the freshman (Gately) in Lane 5," said Lis, who finished fourth in the 100 butterfly final. "It feels awesome. It's a nice reward and all that hard work, that I've put in on all those days, paid off."

Moments after he cleared the awards stand, Lis watched his childhood friend Sam Willett try and keep the 200 IM title at Silver Creek.

The Raptors sophomore fell behind D'Evelyn's Daniel Graber early and was unable to reel him in during the breaststroke portion of the race and ended up finishing third in 1:55.35.

It was a disappointing Friday for Willett in his other race, the 100 breaststroke, but he came back strong on Saturday. Swimming in the consolation heat, Willett's winning time of 59.48 would have placed him third overall.

"I kind of didn't follow my own advice yesterday, I said you can't hold anything back at prelims in state, and something didn't click yesterday and it just didn't happen, it didn't work," Willett said. "Luckily I was able to come back today and swim that time (59.48) and I'm happy with it even though I'm not on the podium.

"It was a great race and I learned a lot from it."

Willett and Lis teamed with Noah Jepson and Morgan DuBois on both the 200 medley and 400 free relay teams that swam in the final, finishing sixth and fourth respectively.

"I think that we had a great state meet, we had a huge team coming into it and we were really close as a team," said Lis of his team's seventh place finish. "Broomfield's Alex Prins is one of the most inspirational and loving kids you will ever meet and him bringing our teams together brought so much to our team and set everyone up for a great meet."

Longmont diver Nick Vaughan knew it was going to take something special to win the 1M diving event, what with two nationally ranked divers — Mullen's David Hoffer and Pueblo East's Vitalii Shestakov — in the field.

The Trojans junior vastly improved on last year's ninth place finish, vaulting to third with a score of 395.75 points.

"I'm totally happy with that," Vaughan said. "I was pretty much settling for third. All in all, they were solid dives and I'm glad I didn't fail."

All Broomfield coach Emily Austin wanted her team to do was to have a short memory.

"They turned things around from yesterday and they did what they could today," said the veteran Eagles coach. "There were time improvements, a couple of place improvements and ultimately, I am proud of these guys.

The one chance Broomfield had to continue its three-year run of winning at least one gold medal at the state meet was senior Blake Logan in the 100 backstroke.

He would have to overcome the defending champion and state record holder, Thompson Valley's John Thorne, in the process. In the end, Thorne's underwater prowess was too much for Logan and the rest of the field to overcome, and he settled for second in 52.49 seconds. Thorne beat his own state mark, winning in 4A record time 48.24.

"That's the fastest time I've ever gone, even in club, so I'm going to take it," said Logan, who began his meet with a sixth-place finish in the 500 free. "It's been a quite successful meet.

"The 500 hurt more than I was expecting it to be, but once I saw that I was going to get sixth, and with the pain, I didn't want to push it so I could save it up for the (backstroke)."

The only other Broomfield individual swimmer in the championship finals on Saturday was freshman Austin Crump in the 100 freestyle.

Despite his eighth place finish, Crump was thrilled with his 47.98 time, a mark he had been waiting a long time to break.

"I'm elated, I wanted to go 47, so it was a great race," Crump said. "I'm happy with my freshman year, I'm happy with my whole team and we had a really good run."

Broomfield made the finals in all three of the relay events. Seniors Logan, Kris Kerr, Sam Henehan and Andy Hahn finished fifth in the opening 200 medley relay.

Having to reshuffle the deck after a minor incident forced Kerr out of the rest of the meet, Crump, Colin Peterson, Alex Prins and Hahn went 1:31.44 in the 200 free relay to finish sixth in that event.
