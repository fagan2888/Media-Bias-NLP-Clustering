Sharpton\u2019s TV show ratings the numbers are clear. Rev. Sharpton\u2019s show has the highest ratings of any 6 p.m. show in the history of the network.\u201d\n\nMr. Sharpton said he \u201cwelcomes the opportunity to answer the frivolous allegations\u201d and says he will be bringing counterclaims for defamation, THR reported.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A black media group has filed a $20 billion lawsuit against Comcast and Time Warner for alleged racial discrimination, as well as MSNBC host Al Sharpton, the NAACP and other black advocacy groups for allegedly being paid to facilitate such discrimination.", "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A black media group has filed a $20 billion lawsuit against Comcast and Time Warner for alleged racial discrimination, as well as MSNBC host Al Sharpton, the NAACP and other black advocacy groups for allegedly being paid to facilitate such discrimination.", "title": "Al Sharpton, Comcast sued for racial discrimination", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/24/al-sharpton-comcast-sued-for-racial-discrimination/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/13/58225fffbd850d30680f6a7067001154.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/13/58225fffbd850d30680f6a7067001154.jpg", "title": "Al Sharpton, Comcast sued for racial discrimination", "description": "A black media group has filed a $20 billion lawsuit against Comcast and Time Warner for alleged racial discrimination, as well as MSNBC host Al Sharpton, the NAACP and other black advocacy groups for", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Al Sharpton, Comcast, Time Warner"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf821\"", "article_summary": "A black media group has filed a $20 billion racial-discrimination lawsuit against Comcast and Time Warner, as well as MSNBC host Al Sharpton, the NAACP and other black advocacy groups, for allegedly being paid to facilitate such discrimination.\nThe National Association of African-American Owned Media and Entertainment Studios Networks filed the complaint in California on Friday ahead of Comcast and Time Warner\u2019s proposed merger.\nSharpton\u2019s TV show ratings the numbers are clear.\nSharpton\u2019s show has the highest ratings of any 6 p.m. show in the history of the network.\u201dMr. Sharpton said he \u201cwelcomes the opportunity to answer the frivolous allegations\u201d and says he will be bringing counterclaims for defamation, THR reported.\n\u201cAs for Rev."}
