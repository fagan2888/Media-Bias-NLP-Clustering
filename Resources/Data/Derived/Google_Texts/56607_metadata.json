That income group represents the low end for qualifying for Obamacare subsidies, and as a rule those people would receive the largest amount of financial aid.\n\nBut there were steep declines in the next two income groups, even though those people receive not only help paying their monthly premiums, but as with the lower earners remain eligible for financial assistance to cover out-of-pocket medical expenses.\n\nJust 41 percent of eligible people earning between 151 and 200 percent of the federal poverty level bought HealthCare.gov plans. And just 30 percent of eligible people in the next income group, earning up to 250 percent of the poverty level, bought such a plan.\n\nOnly 16 percent of eligible people who earned between $35,427 and $47,080\u2014the high-end Obamacare subsidy recipients\u2014bought a HealthCare.gov plan.\n\nAnd when the subsidies weren't available, because a person earned more than $47,080, the participation was far lower.\n\nJust 2 percent of eligible people above that income enrolled in a HealthCare.gov plan, the Avalere analysis found.\n\nRead MoreObamacare windfall: Big drop in uncompensated care\n\n\n\n\"Virtually all of the people signing up for this are people who receive subsidies from the federal government,\" said Avalere Health CEO Dan Mendelson.\n\n\"A lot of the higher-income people are not participating in this,\" he said. \"The exchanges are primarily a low-income benefit. ... The people signing up for these benefits are the ones that are heavily subsidized.\"\n\nMendelson said the findings are significant, because \"it shows sort of a lukewarm embrace\" of Obamacare among the people its meant to benefit.\n\nThe findings also suggest that the penalties for not having health coverage are less of an incentive for people buy Obamacare than the subsidies are.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Lower-income earners were much more likely to sign up for HealthCare.gov plans, higher earners were cooler to the Obamacare marketplace.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Lower-income earners were much more likely to sign up for HealthCare.gov plans, higher earners were cooler to the Obamacare marketplace.", "title": "Surprise: Obamacare's high/low income results", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/25/low-income-people-loved-obamacare-but-the-rest-of-us.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/03/25/102535258-82149358.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lower-income earners were much more likely to sign up for HealthCare.gov plans, higher earners were cooler to the Obamacare marketplace.", "title": "Low-income people loved Obamacare, but the rest of us...", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/25/low-income-people-loved-obamacare-but-the-rest-of-us.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/03/25/102535258-82149358.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, Obamacare, US: News, Politics, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-03-25T14:37:51-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2015-03-25T15:46:08-0400", "tag": "Politics"}, "pageNodeId": 102534125, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, HealthCare.gov, Avalere Health, health insurance, surprise"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2045\"", "article_summary": "That income group represents the low end for qualifying for Obamacare subsidies, and as a rule those people would receive the largest amount of financial aid.\nOnly 16 percent of eligible people who earned between $35,427 and $47,080\u2014the high-end Obamacare subsidy recipients\u2014bought a HealthCare.gov plan.\nThe findings also suggest that the penalties for not having health coverage are less of an incentive for people buy Obamacare than the subsidies are.\nMendelson said the findings are significant, because \"it shows sort of a lukewarm embrace\" of Obamacare among the people its meant to benefit.\nJust 41 percent of eligible people earning between 151 and 200 percent of the federal poverty level bought HealthCare.gov plans."}
