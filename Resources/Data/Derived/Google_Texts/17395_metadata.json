Paul LePage came to Central Maine Medical Center on Wednesday to present a $43 million check to the hospital from the state of Maine.\n\n\u201cUncle Sam\u201d showed up to present a $1.05 billion check to LePage.\n\nAdditional Photos Gov.

On Wednesday, the governor went about the business of making good on his word.\n\nHowever, the governor\u2019s victory tour was disrupted by a political and policy priority of Democrats: the expansion of Medicaid, the public health insurance program for the poor, through the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nAs LePage presented the oversized check to officials at Central Maine Medical Center, Nickerson, an activist from the Maine People\u2019s Alliance, brought the check to LePage. The fake check was from the federal government \u2013 a reference to the \u201cfederal dollars\u201d that Democratic lawmakers and activists say LePage is forgoing through his resistance to expanding Medicaid to more than 60,000 Mainers.\n\nAs the hospital event began, Nickerson entered the lobby wearing his costume. He didn\u2019t speak, but struck a wide stance off to LePage\u2019s right. He stood silently, holding the check and pointing to the crowd \u2013 the iconic gesture made by Uncle Sam. LePage laughed initially, as did the crowd of doctors and nurses who lined the hospital entrance on an exposed balcony.\n\nThe governor continued with his prepared remarks, saying repaying the hospital debt was one of his proudest accomplishments.\n\nNickerson, however, was the focus of the crowd. Eventually, Peter Steele, the governor\u2019s spokesman, gestured to a member of LePage\u2019s security detail. Nickerson was escorted out of the hospital without incident. As he left, a man in the crowd muttered to him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a job?\u201d\n\nThe fight over Medicaid dominated the last legislative session. It promises to continue through 2014, a gubernatorial and legislative election year. LePage launched the first salvo this week, selecting findings in a University of Michigan study to argue that Medicaid expansion would benefit younger men, smokers and those who are likely to consume alcohol.\n\nAlthough the study was supportive of expansion, the governor\u2019s message was clear: The able-bodied, smokers and drinkers will receive taxpayer-funded health care.\n\nThe next day Democratic legislative leaders announced that they would introduce Medicaid expansion legislation in January. It will be their third attempt after failing to convince enough Republicans to support a bill that combined the governor\u2019s hospital payback plan with expansion, and another amended version co-authored by Senate minority leader Sen. Roger Katz, R-Augusta.\n\n\u201cWe will never stop fighting for health care for thousands of Maine people,\u201d Democratic House Speaker Mark Eves said during a news conference Tuesday.\n\nAssistant Senate majority leader Anne Haskell, D-Portland, added, \u201cGov. LePage should join all the other Republican governors who have put aside partisanship and political games to expand health care for the people in their state. Instead, our governor has doubled down his \u2018deny and delay\u2019 of expanding health care and he is spreading misinformation and fear, pitting Mainers against each other.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s stunt by the Maine People\u2019s Alliance was a continuation of the political battle. The nonprofit group supports state Democratic candidates and causes, through voter-registration and get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\nLePage on Wednesday took a few questions from reporters. He initially declined to talk about Medicaid but relented after being pressed on the issue. He said Democrats hadn\u2019t come forward with any meaningful compromise plan and were using the issue for political gain. He said he wouldn\u2019t expand Medicaid until the Legislature funded existed Medicaid services for several thousand disabled residents on a waiting list.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t pick and choose who you cover for votes,\u201d LePage said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to put people over politics.\u201d\n\nThe disabled Mainers referenced by LePage receive some Medicaid coverage but are waiting for additional services for which they qualify.\n\nThe waiting list is the subject of a court action filed May 28 that effectively compelled the LePage administration to cover qualified recipients. Lawmakers authorized $10.4 million in the state budget to draw down the waiting list, but more funds are needed.\n\nLater during the event, MPA activist Marie Pineo of Yarmouth told LePage that she was going to lose her health care coverage if LePage didn\u2019t go along with expansion. Pineo held a letter from the state saying her coverage would expire Jan. 1, 2014.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t health care a basic human right?\u201d Pineo said. \u201cWhy should people die because of your politics?\u201d\n\nThe governor asked Pineo if she had a job. She said she did. He told Pineo that she could still qualify for coverage through subsidies in the Affordable Care Act, that most of her insurance costs would be paid for.\n\nPineo, surrounded by reporters after the event, later said that she wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d qualify for the subsidies.\n\nExpansion would broaden MaineCare, the state\u2019s Medicaid program, to cover adults without children who earn under $15,856 a year. Eligibility would expire after three years, when federal reimbursements for the program are scheduled to decline from 100 percent to 90 percent, unless the Legislature takes additional action.\n\nMore than 15,000 low-income parents are expected to lose coverage in January, when changes to MaineCare take effect. An additional 10,500 adults with no dependent children and incomes less than $11,500 will lose coverage.\n\nThe 10,500 childless adults fall into a loophole in the Affordable Care Act that makes them ineligible for federal subsidies for private insurance even if they\u2019re not covered by Medicaid.\n\nDemocrats are hoping that the pending loss of MaineCare coverage for some Mainers will convince some Republican lawmakers to support the new proposal.\n\nThe event, although upstaged by the Medicaid debate, brought LePage full circle on the hospital debt issue. In 2010 he campaigned in front of Central Maine Medical Center, saying that repaying the debt would be a priority if he were elected.\n\nThe debt stemmed from unpaid Medicaid reimbursement payments from the state to the hospitals.\n\nThe Medicaid debt began accumulating years before Gov. John Baldacci took office in 2003. It has been attributed to a payment system that didn\u2019t keep pace with hospitals\u2019 Medicaid claims to the state.\n\nBaldacci and the Legislature made payments that sent $3.7 billion to hospitals over the last decade, but not enough to erase the debt.\n\nThe Legislature approved LePage\u2019s debt payback plan this year. Since then the governor has linked the hospital debt to the Medicaid debate. During prepared remarks he called the hospital debt \u201cwelfare debt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese payments to hospitals are not a windfall,\u201d he said in prepared remarks. \u201cIt is welfare debt owed for over a decade that the state of Maine is finally making good on.\u201d\n\nRepublicans had varying reactions to MPA\u2019s stunt. David Sorensen, the communications director for House minority leader Rep. Kenneth Fredette, R-Newport, tweeted, \u201cTypical. GOP pays off welfare debt despite D obstruction; shameless (MPA) jack*** makes scene for more welfare spending.\u201d\n\nThe wrinkle in Wednesday\u2019s staged event marked another chapter in the ongoing public clash between LePage and Democrats \u2014 and another involving a big check. In May, moments after the Democratic-controlled Legislature passed the bill linking LePage\u2019s hospital payback plan to Medicaid expansion, LePage and several Republican lawmakers quickly gathered in the State House Hall of Flags in front of the media to veto the bill. Democrats had reserved the Hall of Flags for a ceremonial bill signing that included a check made out to Maine\u2019s hospitals, but LePage\u2019s veto upstaged the event.\n\nS.
