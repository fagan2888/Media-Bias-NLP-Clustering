This month, he might say that a Tennessee curriculum has an Islam-shaped hole -- and so do most mainstream media covering the controversy over it.\n\nGround Zero is Maury County, where parents of seventh-graders have complained that their children were being forced to learn the basics of Islam in seventh-grade social studies classes.\n\nAs part of curricula in history, geography and government, middle school children are required to learn about several religions, including Buddhism and Hinduism. But parents were startled this year when a unit on Christianity was skipped in favor of teachings like the Five Pillars of Islam.\n\nBrandee Porterfield, who has a daughter at Spring Hill Middle School, complained to the Columbia Daily Herald:\n\nThe mother said she was concerned about her child being taught the \u201cShahada,\u201d the Muslim profession of faith which was contained in a foldable teaching material.\n\nOne of the translations of the creed reads, \u201cThere is no god but Allah; Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no problem with the teacher at all. It\u2019s just that yellow foldable seems to be teaching our children religion in schools, and only that religion,\u201d Porterfield said. \u201cFrom a religion point of view, if the schools are going to be teaching religion in history, they need to teach them all equally.\u201d\n\nOther parents complained that children were told to write and recite the Shahada, which they said amounts to teaching Islam. Parent Brandee Porterfield told the Spring Hill Home Page:\n\n\"The teacher approached my daughter before class and was very understanding. My daughter told her she would not recite or write the Shahada or anything saying 'Allah is the only God.' The teacher said she wouldn't have to.\"\n\nDuring class time on Tuesday, Porterfield said the teacher verbally asked students about the five pillars, \"And the students were reciting the Shahada.\"\n\nIn the Daily Herald, another parent, Joy Ellis, says that her child was \"required to write 'Allah is the only God.' ... I didn't have a problem with the history of Islam being taught, but to go so far as to make my child write the Shahada, is unacceptable.\"\n\nIf Ellis is right, that's a serious breach of the First Amendment -- not to mention school ethics. Can you imagine children in public school being told to recite \"I believe in Jesus as my personal Savior,\" as a means of understanding evangelical Christianity?\n\nBut were the kids, in fact, so required? If reporters asked school officials, they didn\u2019t tell us. Instead, they report more general statements.\n\nThe longest was from Chris Marczak, director of Maury County Schools. His 315-word response says in part:\n\nThe assignment covered some sensitive topics that are of importance to Islamic religion and caused some confusion around whether we are asking students to believe in or simply understand the religion. It is our job as a public school system to educate our students on world history in order to be ready to compete in a global society, not to endorse one religion over another or indoctrinate.\n\nBut then, Marczak then made it worse: \"I encourage you to talk with your children, talk with your teachers, and talk with your principals.\" That prompted one parent to accuse him of a \"political shell game\" for setting curriculum at the school board level, then passing on responsibility to principals.\n\nThe Columbia Daily Herald helpfully explains that the state sets academic standards and that local districts determine curricula. It also quotes Jan Hanvey, Maury County's middle school supervisor, on when and how Christianity comes up:\n\nThe state\u2019s pacing guide says seventh grade social studies begins with the Islamic world, then moves on to studies in ancient Africa. The year ends with the \u201cAge of Exploration,\u201d which is continued in eighth grade.\n\nChristianity is studied during the Age of Exploration section partly because religious persecution is one of the main reasons pilgrims left in search of a new world, Hanvey said.\n\nHmmm, but that sounds like Christianity will be treated differently than Islam in Maury County. Sounds like Eric Owens of the Daily Caller got it right: \"Students will hear about Christians persecuting other Christians in some countries in Western Europe.\" But Owens may have been the only one who raised that issue -- and if he asked for a response from educators, he doesn\u2019t say.\n\nThere\u2019s at least one other hole in the Daily Herald story. It has Hanvey saying that \"the curriculum and topics have been covered for at least 31 years.\" But in his statement, Chris Marczak of Maury County Schools said the standards were just implemented last school year. No media resolved this discrepancy.\n\nAnd those covering this story don't show much knowledge of the topic. The Spring Hill Home Page mentions \"the Shahada, or Five Pillars of Faith in Islam: prayer, almsgiving, fasting, pilgrimage and creed.\" Then it seems to self-contradict in saying Shahada is the \"creed pillar.\" Someone at the Home Page should have flagged that.\n\nBut what looms largest here is the significance of assigning public school children to recite the Shahada. While it's not unanimous, you can find lots of examples that say you convert to Islam by reciting the Shahada. This one, by the Office for Dawah in Rawdah, Saudi Arabia, will suffice:\n\nBecoming a Muslim is a simple and easy process. All that a person has to do is to say a sentence called the Testimony of Faith (Shahada), which is pronounced as:\n\nI testify \u201cLa ilaha illa Allah, Muhammad rasoolu Allah.\u201d\n\nThese Arabic words mean, \u201cThere is no true god (deity) but God (Allah), and Muhammad is the Messenger (Prophet) of God.\u201d Once a person says the Testimony of Faith (Shahada) with conviction and understanding its meaning, then he/she has become a Muslim.\n\nIf Tennessee's newspeople and educators were unaware of this, they need some education themselves. And they wouldn\u2019t have to go far for it. This website counts at least 19 mosques in Tennessee -- seven just in Nashville, about 30 miles from Spring Hill.\n\nThumb: Calligraphic representation of the Kalima, the content of the statement of faith known as Shahada.
