That beat the estimate from CNNMoney\u2019s survey of economists, who predicted 235,000 job gains.\n\nFebruary\u2019s job growth shows how far the economy has come in a year. It\u2019s the 12th straight month that the economy has gained over 200,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate fell to 5.5%.\n\nThat\u2019s the lowest unemployment rate since May 2008 \u2014 before the financial crisis. Unemployment has come a long way from a year ago when it was 6.7%.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. labor market is still a bright spot in this economic recovery,\u201d says Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities. \u201cIt\u2019s strengthening and improving.\u201d\n\nWhat about wages? As more Americans return to work, the question now is when will wages pick up. Average weekly wages only rose 2% in February compared to a year ago. In a healthy economy, wages gains are between 3.5% and 4%.\n\nThe snail-pace wage gains are a key reason why many folks still aren\u2019t feeling off better during this recovery.\n\nWages are quickly becoming the focal point for the economy\u2019s health. The Federal Reserve wants to see better wage growth before it raises its key interest rate, which will have a big impact on the economy and markets. Friday\u2019s report is the last look at the job market before the Fed\u2019s policy making committee meets this month.\n\nIf job growth continues, wages should speed up too, many economists argue. But February\u2019s jobs report told the same tale: excellent job gains in recent months with lackluster wage growth.\n\nWages should pick up if the unemployment stays at or below 5.5%, says Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, a research firm.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s still the weak part of the report,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan says, but \u201cit\u2019s not unreasonable to think at some point in the next year, we\u2019re going to get more clear cut wage acceleration.\u201d\n\nWhere the jobs are: Job gains were across the board in many businesses, including retail, health care, and business services.\n\nRetail businesses added 32,000 jobs last month, continuing their role as leaders in the jobs recovery. On the downside, retail tends to have a higher concentration of low-wage jobs than other sectors.\n\nOne warning sign is that energy companies are starting to scale back employment because of low oil prices. Energy jobs fell for a second straight month in February, although the drop was modest. The energy sector has high-paying jobs, and it played a big role in job growth during the recovery.\n\nMany economists say falling oil and gas prices are positive the economy. The national gas average was as low as $2 a gallon at the start of the year, leading the government to predict American households will save $750 this year on fuel. But it\u2019s unclear whether the energy sector will carry the job growth baton if energy prices don\u2019t rebound a bit more.\n\nOne solution could be health care. It had another strong month, gaining 24,000 jobs. Obamacare has undoubtedly driven some of that job progress. But there\u2019s a jobs caveat to Obamacare: many employers are trying to cut back hours on part-time employees so they don\u2019t have to offer them health insurance.\n\nStill, the overall takeaway is that February showed strong signs of America\u2019s economy heading in the right direction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s come a long way, and it\u2019s continuing to improve fairly rapidly,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan says.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "40.712784;-74.005941", "description": "The winter weather didn't cool the job market in February.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "fc2caefd8163039c48c3b35b178e0993"}, "og": {"site_name": "WTVR.com", "description": "The winter weather didn\u2019t cool the job market in February.", "title": "Jobs Report: Unemployment dips to lowest in 7 years", "url": "http://wtvr.com/2015/03/06/february-jobs-report-unemployment-dips/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/s002585252.jpg?w=1200", "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@cbs6", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 572089813, "iphone": 572089813}}, "image": {"src": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/s002585252.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@cbs6"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=572089813", "fb": {"pages": 6860957425}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wtvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1e5f8555355860d96f4528b85609455b?s=16", "application-name": "WTVR.com", "ICBM": "40.712784, -74.005941", "keywords": "national, news, business economy and money", "google-site-verification": "xp-vKfdwBt7bllcG4eSrgb2mL-O45aD7dIeyF4EmMF8", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr", "published_time": "2015-03-06T15:37:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-06T15:37:03+00:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s the 12th straight month that the economy has gained over 200,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate fell to 5.5%.\nBut February\u2019s jobs report told the same tale: excellent job gains in recent months with lackluster wage growth.\nRetail businesses added 32,000 jobs last month, continuing their role as leaders in the jobs recovery.\nThe energy sector has high-paying jobs, and it played a big role in job growth during the recovery.\nEnergy jobs fell for a second straight month in February, although the drop was modest."}
