Moore made four 3-pointers and scored 20 or more points for a franchise-record ninth straight game.\n\n\u201cI was a little bit anxious and nervous at the same time,\u201d Fowles said. \u201cI think the first quarter, I got a lot of the jitters out. The second quarter, I started getting more into a groove and then it was just downhill from there. I\u2019m excited to play with this group of young women and it was fun tonight, so I really can\u2019t complain.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles\u2019 Jantel Lavender had 15 points and 10 rebounds for her 10th double-double. Parker, who rested during the first half of the season, had 12 points, seven rebounds, and nine assists.\n\n\u201cI just treated it like I treated any other game,\u201d Parker said. \u201cObviously a little bit more excited, it was a little bit tougher to take a pregame nap, but I\u2019m excited to be back. It wasn\u2019t the outcome we expected, but we can build off this.\u201d\n\nAlana Beard made her first appearance for Los Angeles since June 14, missing 14 games with a foot injury. She made her first two shots during Los Angeles\u2019 6-0 run to start the game and finished with eight points in 20 minutes. Parker scored her first points on a fastbreak layup with 5:05 left in the second quarter to cut Los Angeles\u2019 deficit to 31-25.\n\nFowles and Whalen combined to score Minnesota\u2019s first nine points of the second quarter to take a 31-18 lead. The Lynx held a 43-35 lead at halftime behind Whalen\u2019s 13 points and Moore\u2019s 11. Whalen returned after missing a game because of an eye injury. She was sporting goggles to protect the injury.\n\n\u201cI played with them overseas for a whole year and then they said chances are great to get hit again with the percentages,\u201d Whalen said. \u201cWell, I got hit again, so I\u2019m probably just going to wear them.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles went on an 8-1 third-quarter run, all scored by Lavender and Parker, to get within 53-49. Moments later, Nneka Ogwumike\u2019s layup made it a one possession game, 56-54, for the first time since it was 14-13. But the Lynx closed on an 8-2 run, capped by Devereaux Peters\u2019 baseline jumper with 2 seconds left, for a 64-56 advantage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maya Moore scored 27 points and Lindsay Whalen had 24 to help the Minnesota Lynx hold off the Los Angeles Sparks 82-76 on Wednesday night, spoiling the season debut of two-time MVP Candace Parker.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Maya Moore scored 27 points and Lindsay Whalen had 24 to help the Minnesota Lynx hold off the Los Angeles Sparks 82-76 on Wednesday night, spoiling the season debut of two-time MVP Candace Parker.", "title": "Moore, Lynx spoil Candace Parker\u2019s season debut", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/29/moore-lynx-spoil-candace-parkers-season-debut/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/29/2c3e9205f52ea1217d0f6a7067003a46.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/29/2c3e9205f52ea1217d0f6a7067003a46.jpg", "description": "Maya Moore scored 27 points and Lindsay Whalen had 24 to help the Minnesota Lynx hold off the Los Angeles Sparks 82-76 on Wednesday night, spoiling the season debut of two-time MVP Candace Parker.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Moore, Lynx spoil Candace Parker\u2019s season debut"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd3d0\"", "article_summary": "Moore and Whalen scored Minnesota\u2019s final 12 points, including a 6-0 run after Los Angeles had pulled within 76-73 with 2:31 left.\nMinnesota (13-4) avoided losing back-to-back home games for the first time since 2013, while Los Angeles (3-14) lost its eighth straight on the road.\nThe second quarter, I started getting more into a groove and then it was just downhill from there.\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Maya Moore scored 27 points and Lindsay Whalen had 24 to help the Minnesota Lynx hold off the Los Angeles Sparks 82-76 on Wednesday night, spoiling the season debut of two-time MVP Candace Parker.\nParker scored her first points on a fastbreak layup with 5:05 left in the second quarter to cut Los Angeles\u2019 deficit to 31-25."}
