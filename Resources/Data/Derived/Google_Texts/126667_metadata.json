On Friday morning, Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush plans on hailing an Uber in San Francisco to show his support for the ride-sharing company and others like it.\n\nFor some Republicans, the contrast made Clinton an easy target.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, argued the former Secretary of State was out of touch with the younger generation. \u201cIf you look at millenials, we love those companies [like Uber], we love consumer choices,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big mistake, I think, that Secretary Clinton chose to go after those companies that are really disrupting those industries for the better.\u201d\n\nBut the politics of Uber aren\u2019t so clear cut for either side.\n\nWhile Republicans love the idea of breaking taxi unions, GOP support for the sharing economy isn\u2019t so clear-cut. Most of the sharing economy vanguard\u2014companies like Uber, AirBnB and Lyft\u2014were born in California, a big blue state, and their corporate blueprints assume the kind of large social safety net favored by Democrats.\n\nSign up for and more view example\n\nAs Uber CEO Travis Kalanick told reporters in Washington in November, the Affordable Care Act was \u201chuge\u201d for his company because the \u201cdemocratization of those types of benefits allow people to have more flexible ways to make a living.\u201d In other words, his company didn\u2019t have to provide health insurance because drivers could buy it on their own through Obamacare. (That was eight months before a California court ruled that Uber drivers are, in fact, employees and thus were owed typical benefits, a decision the company is appealing.)\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, who built a fortune in cell phone technology, calls it \u201cthe gig economy.\u201d Part-time or temporary workers already account for 40.4% of the workforce, up from 35.3% in 2006. Many of these workers have several jobs doing things like driving for Uber, renting out their couch through Airbnb or doing freelance journalism, software coding or videography. These jobs provide workers with flexibility and give them an alternative to unemployment, but the drawback is that they don\u2019t come with the standard package of benefits most full-time workers have long enjoyed.\n\nUnderlining Clinton\u2019s concerns about the gig economy, Jake Sullivan, one of her top policy advisors, told a group of Washington journalists at a breakfast Tuesday organized by the Christian Science Monitor that there\u2019s no easy answer. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge question and a very hard one,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Clinton faces the risk of looking uncool by criticizing companies like Uber, Bush faces an even tougher question. After all, repealing Obamacare is at the top of every 2016 Republican candidates\u2019 list. It\u2019s one thing to ride in an Uber, but quite another to figure out how to fix its business model if the safety net shrinks.\n\nBut if the 2016 candidates are just skirting around the edges of the issue, Congress has barely touched it.\n\nA self-described pro-business moderate, Warner is just about the only one on Capitol Hill thinking about these issues. He\u2019s exploring legislation that would help freelancers, such as creating an Obamacare-type program for retirement benefits or building off the model that some trade unions have for contract workers to receive benefits. He also is looking to revamp the tax code to create a category for \u201cdependent workers,\u201d a hybrid between a contractor and a full-time employee that would end the debates, if not the legal challenges, on exactly what kind of an employee gig economy workers are.\n\nBut Warner is months, if not years, away from legislation and little is likely to pass before the election, regardless. Which leaves the issue open for debate among the 2016 field. Where should workers in the gig economy get benefits: from their employers or the government?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Both Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton are trying to make Uber a campaign issue, but it won't play out along the usual lines.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The ride-sharing company hit the 2016 campaign trail.", "title": "Jeb Bush Hails Uber, While Hillary Clinton Criticizes", "url": "http://time.com/3960082/uber-jeb-bush-hillary-clinton/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-basta.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=594", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-basta.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=594"}, "description": "The ride-sharing company hit the 2016 campaign trail.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jeb Bush Hails Uber, While Hillary Clinton Criticizes"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "jeb bush, hillary clinton, uber, hillary clinton uber, jeb bush uber, sharing economy", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton, Uber, Hillary Clinton Uber, Jeb Bush Uber, sharing economy"}, "article_summary": "While Clinton faces the risk of looking uncool by criticizing companies like Uber, Bush faces an even tougher question.\nWhere should workers in the gig economy get benefits: from their employers or the government?\nDuring a rollout of her economic plan Monday, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton took companies like Uber to task for not giving drivers benefits.\n\u201cIf you look at millenials, we love those companies [like Uber], we love consumer choices,\u201d she said.\nBut Warner is months, if not years, away from legislation and little is likely to pass before the election, regardless."}
