If you think Obamacare has changed the face of healthcare, you haven’t seen anything yet.

The seven top-rated healthcare stocks here — UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM), Eli Lilly (LLY), Regeneron (REGN), Stryker (SYK) and Incyte (INCY) — are already dominating their sectors, and they will continue their leadership well into the next decade.

This is the kind of trend that real long-term growth investors want to see.

With roughly 76 million baby boomers in the U.S. today, healthcare customers are getting collectively older. And by 2029 the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 61 million will be around when the youngest boomers hit 65. In other words, about 20% of the U.S. population will be over the age of 65.

The aging demographic completely changes the dynamic of how healthcare will be delivered, paid for and accessed. That means massive changes between now and then for those paying for services, developing treatments and providing care.

Below are some of the top companies that are leading the way.
