(AP) - Winter in Garnet ghost town is a stark contrast to summer in the old mining town.\n\nWith hardly anyone wandering through main street, Garnet feels like a true ghost town.\n\nEach winter, the Bureau of Land Management, which manages Garnet, offers a unique way to experience the ghost town.\n\nThe BLM rents out two cabins in Garnet from Dec. 1 through the end of April. A larger cabin that can sleep up to six people is $40 a night and a smaller one-room cabin large enough for four people is $30 a night.\n\nThe BLM holds a lottery each fall for reservations in the cabin. Reservation applications were due earlier this month.\n\nHowever, if you missed the lottery deadline, don\u2019t worry. There are typically still plenty of nights available in the cabins, said Maria Craig, outdoor recreation planner for the BLM in Missoula.\n\nFull moon nights and three-day weekends are the most coveted in the lottery. The most popular months for reservations are January and February. December can be tricky because sometimes there isn\u2019t enough snow on the ground to be able to ski or snowmobile. The same can be true in April.\n\nThe two cabins are rustic. They don\u2019t have water or electricity. However, they do have propane lights and a propane stove, along with a wood stove for heat.\n\nWater is usually available at an outdoor spigot. Last winter, the water system wasn\u2019t working, but Craig hopes that problem has been fixed.\n\n\u201cSo far we do have water,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the winter, Garnet can only be accessed by snowmobile, cross-country skis or snowshoes.\n\nTwo routes lead into Garnet - one from Highway 200 and the other from Interstate 90. The route from Highway 200 is about 11 miles with about 2,300 feet of elevation gain. The route from Interstate 90 is shorter, about five miles, but steeper, gaining about 2,000 feet in those five miles.\n\nBoth options are long and challenging, Craig said. Visitors should be prepared with safety equipment, warm clothes and extra food and water.\n\nLottery applicants will be notified of results by Nov. 21. They\u2019ll also receive the combination to get into their cabin. They should be sure to bring that, along with the map of the town they\u2019ll receive showing the location of the cabins.\n\nAfter the lottery, reservations for remaining dates can be made by calling the BLM in Missoula at 406-329-3914.\n\n___\n\nThe original story can be found on the Great Falls Tribune\u2019s website: http://gftrib.com/1stcWcm\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Great Falls Tribune, http://www.greatfallstribune.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Winter in Garnet ghost town is a stark contrast to summer in the old mining town.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Winter in Garnet ghost town is a stark contrast to summer in the old mining town.", "title": "Winter makes a Montana ghost town even spookier", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/15/winter-makes-a-montana-ghost-town-even-spookier/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/13/0278a43583603a2c650f6a70670008a3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/13/0278a43583603a2c650f6a70670008a3.jpg", "description": "Winter in Garnet ghost town is a stark contrast to summer in the old mining town.", "card": "summary", "title": "Winter makes a Montana ghost town even spookier"}, "Author": "ERIN MADISON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "(AP) - Winter in Garnet ghost town is a stark contrast to summer in the old mining town.\nEach winter, the Bureau of Land Management, which manages Garnet, offers a unique way to experience the ghost town.\nIn the winter, Garnet can only be accessed by snowmobile, cross-country skis or snowshoes.\nAfter the lottery, reservations for remaining dates can be made by calling the BLM in Missoula at 406-329-3914.\nWith hardly anyone wandering through main street, Garnet feels like a true ghost town."}
