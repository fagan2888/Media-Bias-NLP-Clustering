Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Republican presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul (R-Y) said front-runner Donald Trump had “no clue” what nuclear triad was and that it “worries me to have someone like Donald Trump or Chris Christie in charge of the nuclear arsenal.”

Paul said, “You know, I think that we’ve all let the polls consume us too much. I don’t think the polls are very accurate. In Kentucky a week before the governor’s race the polls were off by 13 points. That’s where they’re supposed to be accurate. I think we have an American Idol type of polls now. One candidate is getting an enormous amount of time on TV and people are saying, ‘yeah, yeah, I might vote for him.’ Those people don’t get out and vote. About 10 percent of Republicans will vote in Iowa. You can be wildly off and disappoint some of us who aren’t as high in the polls. If we skew the coverage forward the polls, it’s a self-fulfilling prophesy. I think we need to examine over things and distribute the coverage better so we have a chance of getting a better president.”

When asked if Trump understands what the nuclear triad is Paul said, “This is the worrisome thing. During the debate absolutely Trump had no clue what the nuclear triad is and he’d been asked the question previously on the radio and had no idea what it was. Now they’ve discovered what it is, they’re ready to use it? I think this is worrisome not only trump but Christie and others on the stage who are really eager to have war. Really eager to show how strong they are and that gets away from the tradition we have of trying to limit power and reluctant to go to war. It gets to temperament. That’s why it worries me to have someone like Donald Trump or Chris Christie in charge of the nuclear arsenal.”
