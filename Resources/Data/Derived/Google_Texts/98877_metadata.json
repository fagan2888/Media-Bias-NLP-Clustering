Local insurance agents, however, say they are still more qualified to make sure residents get the best policy to fit their specific needs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so complex and complicated that you\u2019ve got to deal with an agent or a person who really understands all the little dos and don\u2019ts in the program,\u201d said Floyd Rogers with Haywood Insurance in Waynesville.\n\nAgent vs. navigator\n\nCertified navigators offer free services to Western North Carolina residents to help them sign up for a health plan through the ACA online marketplace website. They are available through Mountain Projects or through hospitals.\n\nInsurance agents can also help sign people up through the online exchange while explaining the details of specific health insurance policies.\n\nAgents do rely on earning a commission for signing people up for insurance. They can still earn a commission when signing someone up through the marketplace, but clients don\u2019t pay that fee \u2014 the insurance companies do.\n\nDawn Hartis, an agent with Stanberry Insurance in Waynesville and Sylva, said an agent could better explain how subsidies work and the differences in copays, deductibles, HMO plans and PPO plans.\n\n\u201cNavigators are there to walk you through the process of signing up, but they are not there to recommend a specific health plan,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve found there is a lot of confusion regarding subsidies and how to determine whether you\u2019re eligible for a subsidy.\u201d\n\nWithout someone knowledgeable enough to make sure clients get the correct subsidy, Hartis said people could end up owing a lot of money back to the government when taxes are due. People who have signed up on the marketplace should receive a form to fill out and submit when they file their taxes.\n\nRogers has been in the business for 44 years and said the process isn\u2019t as simple as some people think.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just sit down and do it on the phone with navigators who have a couple of months of training,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they are helpful, but I don\u2019t know that they have the proper training to select a company and a plan.\u201d\n\nDemand of services\n\nDespite the push toward seeing a navigator, insurance agents are still signing plenty of people up for health insurance. During the first year of open enrollment, Blue Cross Blue Shield was the only marketplace provider in North Carolina.\n\nHartis said Stanberry was busy with new clients thanks to referrals, advertising and health insurance seminars.\n\nThe 2015 open enrollment deadline is Feb. 15 to have coverage begin March 1, but Hartis recommends getting signed up as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t wait till Feb. 15,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had people coming in Dec. 14 for last deadline (Dec. 15) and the volume just can\u2019t be handled, so the earlier the better.\u201d\n\nCarroll Smith with Smith Insurance Services in Sylva said he hadn\u2019t received the calls he thought he would during the current open enrollment period despite placing advertising in local newspapers.\n\nCurrent clients have called to update their policies for 2015, but Smith said he had very few new policies through the marketplace. With the Feb. 15 deadline looming, Smith said he hopes to sign more people up for health care. The penalty for not having insurance in 2014 was $90, and that penalty increases to $325 in 2015.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have the number of calls I thought I would and I don\u2019t understand that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe penalties are going to get steeper every year.\u201d\n\nRogers said having navigators taking over the role of the agent has hurt his industry over the last couple of years. However, the navigators, who are funded through a federal grant program, will be gone after this year\u2019s enrollment period.\n\n\u201cSo what will people do when they have a billing question or a claim problem?\u201d he said. \u201cBuying a policy is one thing but the service goes along with it \u2014 that\u2019s the total package.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Rogers said his business has done well with sign-ups through word of mouth advertising and developing relationships over 40 years. He added that he has helped many people who signed up using a navigator and then felt like they got the wrong plan.\n\nWords of wisdom\n\nNorth Carolina now has three insurance carrier options \u2014 BCBS, CoventryOne and United Healthcare \u2014 but agents warn that not all carriers can offer the same services in this region.\n\nRogers said residents might be eligible for cheaper plans through the other companies, but they should also take into consideration that many of the health care providers in Western North Carolina are in the BCBS network. It\u2019s important to know which physicians are in the network.\n\nRogers said there are many aspects of ACA that can be better explained by insurance agents. He said it\u2019s more than just signing up for insurance now \u2014 the plan chosen and the subsidy given will affect everyone\u2019s tax returns.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge with this issue is now the IRS is in charge of your health insurance because it\u2019s based on subsidies, which is based on payrolls and income,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they file their taxes, people are going to be surprised with the penalties.\u201d\n\nRogers said many people might have underreported their income or might have received a subsidy when they actually weren\u2019t supposed to qualify for one. Those people will end up owing the government money come tax time.\n\nHartis said people are eligible for a subsidy only if they meet the financial hardship requirements and are not eligible through an employer\u2019s group policy. She also said people who didn\u2019t sign up by the Dec. 15 deadline for their policy to go into effect Jan. 1 will receive a pro-rated penalty.\n\nKeeping up with the new rules and regulations under ACA means additional training for insurance agents, but it\u2019s something they\u2019ve become accustomed to in a changing industry.\n\nHartis, who has been an agent for 20 years, said she goes through 12 hours of training a year for ACA on top of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and Blue Cross Blue Shield training each year.\n\n\u201cYou just got to roll with the punches,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "News, issues, and events from Haywood, Jackson, Macon and Swain counties in western North Carolina.", "generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "title": "Insurance agents adjust to industry under ACA", "og": {"url": "http://smokymountainnews.com/news/item/14902-insurance-agents-adjust-to-industry-under-aca", "type": "article", "description": "News, issues, and events from Haywood, Jackson, Macon and Swain counties in western North Carolina.", "title": "Insurance agents adjust to industry under ACA"}, "author": "Jessi Stone", "robots": "index, follow", "keywords": "affordable care act,healthcare,insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd150d\"", "article_summary": "Insurance agents can also help sign people up through the online exchange while explaining the details of specific health insurance policies.\nKeeping up with the new rules and regulations under ACA means additional training for insurance agents, but it\u2019s something they\u2019ve become accustomed to in a changing industry.\nRogers said there are many aspects of ACA that can be better explained by insurance agents.\nLocal insurance agents, however, say they are still more qualified to make sure residents get the best policy to fit their specific needs.\nHartis said Stanberry was busy with new clients thanks to referrals, advertising and health insurance seminars."}
