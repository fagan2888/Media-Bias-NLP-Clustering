Caleb Rowden, R-Columbia, blamed the Affordable Care Act for MU\u2019s decision.\n\n\"#GradInsurance debacle is a DIRECT result of #ObamaCare. #MIZZOU has to break the law to do the right thing,\" Rowden tweeted Aug. 21.\n\nMU cited an IRS decision based on the Affordable Care Act as the reason for pulling insurance subsidies for graduate students, who are considered university employees.\n\nThe university said it would be subject to an excise tax of $36,500 per year per student employee if it continued its subsidies program, which was specifically designed to help graduate students pay for health insurance.\n\nTo make up for the subsidies, MU announced it would give a one-time fellowship to all eligible graduate students. By law, the university couldn\u2019t tell students the fellowships funds had to be used to purchase health insurance.\n\nOn Aug. 21, after significant student pressure, MU announced it would \"defer implementation of its decision regarding graduate student health insurance,\" according to a letter by MU Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin. In other words, the university reinstated graduate student health insurance subsidies \u2014 at least for the time being.\n\nEven after the university restored the subsidies, it wasn\u2019t clear if MU\u2019s initial withdrawal of the funds could be blamed on the Affordable Care Act, or if MU had actually broken the law by reinstating the benefits. We decided to take a look.\n\n\u2018#GradInsurance debacle is a DIRECT result of #ObamaCare\u2019\n\nMU student employees aren\u2019t eligible for the group health plan the university offers to other workers. And, unlike other universities, MU doesn\u2019t provide a student group health insurance plan.\n\nInstead, students \u2014 graduate and undergraduate \u2014 can opt to sign up for an individual health plan offered through Aetna Health.\n\nSome graduate students are eligible to receive subsidies from MU to pay for their insurance, according to the MU Office of Graduate Studies website. To get the money, graduate students have to sign up for a student individual health plan provided by Aetna.\n\nThen, students must email the Office of Graduate Studies, which verifies enrollment in the plan and eligibility for subsidies. Students then receive a reimbursement for the insurance plan\u2019s partial or total cost. Subsidy levels depend on, among other factors, the number of hours students work per week.\n\nBy asking students to enroll in an individual health plan to receive money, MU requires its student employees to use the subsidies to purchase insurance, said Sidney Watson, a health law professor at St. Louis University School of Law.\n\nThat\u2019s a big no-no, according to IRS regulations created to enforce the Affordable Care Act. According to the IRS, employers are allowed to give money to their employees that could go toward purchasing individual health insurance. But employers can\u2019t require workers to use the cash specifically for that purpose, Watson said.\n\nTo comply with the health care law, employers can provide subsidies \u2014 and require that the money be used to purchase health insurance \u2014 only to employees enrolled in a group plans.\n\nAnd as we said, MU graduate students aren\u2019t part of a group health plan.\n\nHence the problem.\n\nIn July, MU realized the potential implications of not complying with the law. The university pulled the subsidies to avoid penalties and legal trouble.\n\nTechnically speaking, MU\u2019s withdrawal of health insurance subsidies for graduate students is \"the result of the interpretation of the Affordable Care Act by the Treasury Department, because the Affordable Care Act itself doesn\u2019t address this question,\" said Timothy Jost, a professor of health care law at Washington and Lee University.\n\nSo, it\u2019s not just the Affordable Care Act that caused the problem. But, the idea that the removal of benefits is a \"direct result of\" the Affordable Care Act isn\u2019t too far from reality.\n\nAbsent the Affordable Care Act, Jost said, it\u2019s likely MU would still be able to legally provide subsidies for graduate students to purchase individual health plans.\n\n\"The basic problem with the statement is that it greatly oversimplifies a very complicated situation,\" Jost said.\n\n\u2018#MIZZOU has to break the law to do the right thing\u2019\n\nBy \"the right thing,\" Rowden meant \"give graduate students health insurance,\" Rowden\u2019s legislative assistant Stuart Murray told PolitiFact Missouri.\n\nBy that measure it\u2019s not correct to say MU broke the law, several experts who spoke to PolitiFact Missouri said.\n\n\"The university has other options; they do NOT have to break the law,\" said Gerald Kominski, a professor of health policy and management at University of California Los Angeles, in an email interview.\n\nMU could dodge legal trouble by adopting UCLA\u2019s model, Kominski said. Health insurance is a mandatory for all UCLA students and it\u2019s a condition of enrollment, according to the university\u2019s website. UCLA automatically signs up all students in a student group health plan, which they\u2019re all then billed for. This effectively requires all graduate students who\u2019ve received increased stipends to use the money to pay for insurance unless they can prove they have insurance from another source, Kominski said.\n\nJost, the Washington and Lee law professor, came up with another alternative.\n\n\"(MU) could simply add (graduate students) to its employer plan as employees and give them employee coverage,\" he said.\n\nA comprehensive student group health plan would also solve the issue, said Philip G. Peters, Jr., MU health law professor emeritus. He also said this solution would be expensive for MU.\n\nThe university\u2019s original solution \u2014 providing stipends to all students that weren\u2019t specifically earmarked for health insurance \u2014 was also within the framework of the law, said Watson, the SLU law professor.\n\nOverall, the experts we spoke to offered at least five alternatives to the graduate health insurance ordeal.\n\nOn balance, \"Rep. Rowden is partially correct and partially very wrong,\" Peters said.\n\nOur ruling\n\nRowden tweeted: \"#GradInsurance debacle is a DIRECT result of #ObamaCare. #MIZZOU has to break the law to do the right thing.\"\n\nWithout the Affordable Care Act, MU wouldn\u2019t have had to remove subsidies for graduate students. But MU can still provide health insurance for its student employees \u2014 all without breaking the law. The university could, for example, create a student group health plan for graduate its graduate student employees.\n\nThe first part of Rowden\u2019s tweet is accurate but takes things out context. The second part of the statement isn\u2019t accurate.
