As a special education teacher at Washington Township High School, she works with students with needs so severe that verbal communication is often difficult, and frustrations can lead to self-injury.\n\nNow, as the Affordable Care Act has pushed the school district to change the way it approaches some of its staffing procedures, she said her job is only going to get harder.\n\n---\n\nConsistency is key for special needs students, said Renzetti, who spoke on the issue at the board of education\u2019s work session Tuesday night. One student in particular, who is nonverbal and prone to self injury, was making significant strides through daily, one-on-one work with her full-time aide, she said.\n\nOnly the aide wasn\u2019t technically a full-time employee of the district. In the morning, she worked part-time as a district employee, and in the afternoon as an employee of Source4Teachers, the company the district uses to outsource its substitute services.\n\nUnder Affordable Care Act provisions \u2014 which include hefty fines for employers who don\u2019t offer health care to employees working beyond a set amount of hours a week \u2014 the technical separation of her employers didn\u2019t matter. According to Board of Education Solicitor Joseph Betley, the Affordable Care Act goes by the \u201cjoint employer\u201d legal theory and would view the one-on-one aide as a full-time employee of the district. In order to prevent serious financial risks, the district administration made the call that all part-time employees who fall in that category \u2014 originally thought to be 16, but Superintendent Robert Goldschmidt said it could be more \u2014 can no longer sub in the district as well.\n\nRenzetti\u2019s student\u2019s aide, unable to work just half-a-day in the schools, left to find full-time work.\n\n\u201cThis student is going to get a new person every day to walk the hallways, to take her to lunch. She\u2019s not going to be responsive because she doesn\u2019t know this person,\u201d said Renzetti. She told the board her student\u2019s progress will likely go back to square one.\n\n\u201cI guarantee she\u2019s going to have setback after setback,\u201d she said.\n\n---\n\nGoldschmidt said it\u2019s a situation that pits the educator in him against the administrator he\u2019s charged with being. He sees the difficulties it\u2019s posing in the classroom, but he also has to pull back and look at the overall impact ACA fines will have on the district\u2019s mission.\n\n\u201cThis is an extremely complicated issue that pits the economic well-being of the district against some educational issues in ways that are hard to resolve,\u201d said Goldschmidt. \u201cIf we have to pay stiff fines down the line, because we didn\u2019t comply appropriately with the Affordable Care Act, that\u2019s money that won\u2019t go into the classroom ... when we protect the district\u2019s financial interest, we protect programs we provide for kids. People lose sight of that.\u201d\n\nKevin Bush, president and chief operating officer at Source4Teachers, said Washington Township is the only district he\u2019s seen run into the joint-employer issue.\n\nThe Cherry Hill-based company had no role in the district\u2019s decision, but took action to notify the affected employees about the issue as part of its partnership with the district. If the move pushes the employees to seek full-time work, Bush said the company will work to find them daily assignments.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really not an issue for us, we\u2019re just trying to be a good partner through the district and help them however we can,\u201d said Bush.\n\nThe most obvious solution \u2014 make all of the one-on-one aides full-time \u2014 isn\u2019t as simple as it seems, said Goldschmidt.\n\n\u201cOne of the ways we and many other districts have tried to save money in recent years is, where it\u2019s appropriate, to make the aides part-time,\u201d said Goldschmidt, adding the estimated $1 million in savings from the staffing switch has been significant, especially in recent years that have seen state aid cut by the millions and the bills to implement state mandates pile up quickly.\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we care more about $1 million than our kids, it\u2019s about finding that balance,\u201d said Goldschmidt. \u201cThat\u2019s the fight. That\u2019s the challenge.\u201d\n\n---\n\nThe district has made exceptions from their decision for its job coaches, a highly-specialized position that works with special education students who need job skill training in the field. They develop relationships with the students, as well as local businesses who employ the students, and spend most days outside of the school.\n\nHe said they\u2019re looking at every specific situation in the district this impacts to see if they can make exceptions there as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do this one case at a time to avoid trying to make any blanket exceptions,\u201d said Goldschmidt.\n\nRenzetti is hopeful she\u2019ll soon see her neediest students with one, consistent aide as the district works to resolve the situation, but she\u2019s going to have some difficult days in her classroom in the meantime.\n\n\u201cUntil that happens, we\u2019ll have any Joe Schmo who takes the job for the day,\u201d she said.\n\n---\n\nContact staff writer Michelle Caffrey at 856-686-3686 or mcaffrey@southjerseymedia.com\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "washington-township-gloucester-county", "title": "Affordable Care Act forces Washington Township schools to make tough call", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Affordable Care Act forces Washington Township schools to make tough call\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/washington-township-times/index.ssf/2014/02/affordable_care_act_forces_was.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/washington-township-times/photo/10697034-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12262038\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-23T11:19:16Z\", \"author\": \"Michelle Caffrey | South Jersey Times\", \"tags\": [\"washington-township-gloucester-county\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/washington-township-times/photo/10697034-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@shellycaffrey", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Every day is a challenge in April Renzetti&#8217;s classroom.
