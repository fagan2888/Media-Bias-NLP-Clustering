In May 1975, then Broncos coach John Ralston and Cardinals coach Don Coryell shared some of their coaching techniques in an \u201cinformation exchange\u201d at Bronco headquarters. Both coaches and their staffs participated in the clinic, in which they exchanged coaching philosophies and plays.\n\nThe session didn\u2019t do much for the Broncos that season, however. They finished second in the AFC West with a 6-8 record and failed to make the playoffs once again.\n\nCoryell, who arrived in St. Louis in 1973 and quickly turned around a struggling franchise, led the Cardinals to its second consecutive NFC East title in 1975, while finishing with the second-best record in the league (11-3).
