Tax collectors in Russia use seizure of beloved pets to prompt payments

Just when you thought Putin’s policies couldn’t get any worse…

Tax collectors in Russia have discovered that the best way to get people to pay off their debts is to take up their cat or beloved pet as collateral, the BBC reported.

State collectors in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk got a resident to pay 12,000 roubles, about $198, in unpaid taxes after they threatened to take his British Shorthair cat.

Interfax news agency said that when the bailiffs arrived at the student’s flat, they initially found nothing of value worth seizing except the cat and it worked as a better motivator for the student.

This was not an isolated incident.

Bailiffs in the Siberian region of Tomsk placed four pedigree Scottish Fold kittens “under arrest” after their ownerfailed to make payments into a company pension fund and a man who owed 20,000 roubles in unpaid utility bills had his “British Shorthair cat named Yasmin and his fluffy pet rabbit” seized, BBC reported.

Despite Putin’s reputation as an animal lover, I guess we shouldn’t be surprised at the lengths he will go to get his money.
