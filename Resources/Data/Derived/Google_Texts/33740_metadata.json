But one undercover inspection of those groups in 2013 revealed a 49 percent error rate.\n\nEnjoying bipartisan support, the tax centers had provided service to low-income and disabled citizens, rural dwellers and citizens not proficient in English. Workers earning $49,000 or less got free face-to-face help from IRS employees.\n\nFunding was not an issue for the program. Unlike other parts of the IRS that faced cutbacks, the taxpayer assistance program was left untouched by Congress.\n\n\u201cIn enacting the IRS\u2019s budget for FY 2015, Congress spared the Taxpayer Services account from the reductions it made to other IRS accounts,\u201d according to a 2014 annual report by the Taxpayer Advocate Service, a federal agency that represents taxpayers.\n\nThe report to Congress was titled, \u201cTaxpayer Service Has Reached Unacceptably Low Levels and Is Getting Worse.\u201d\n\nEven so, according to the IRS, the administration abruptly ended the service in January 2014 without hearings, legislation or a public comment period.\n\nDiscontinuing the program has generated a storm of protest from taxpayer advocates who say the poor and disadvantaged are facing increasingly complicated tax burdens, but are getting less help from the Obama administration.\n\nMany tax advocates say ending the service for the poor is the height of hypocrisy for an administration that claims to support the little guy.\n\n\u201cThe thing is that this is an administration that pledges itself as trying to help out ordinary Americans, to help out the little guy,\u201d observed Ryan Ellis, the tax policy director at the conservative Americans for Tax Reform.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t think they would be shutting down an office whose very focus is to help those very people,\u201d he said.\n\nDaniel J. Pilla, a tax litigation consultant, says he considers the elimination of the program \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got these people who make every effort to comply with the code. They look to the IRS for help and they\u2019re not getting it,\u201d he argued in an interview with TheDC.\n\n\u201cThe decision to not provide the service was a deliberate decision that to me is outrageous,\u201d he told TheDC.\n\nNotably, the taxpayer advocate service of the IRS has condemned the elimination of the tax assistance program.\n\n\u201c[T]he government is largely turning its back on a significant number of taxpayers who require face-to-face assistance to comply with their tax obligations,\u201d the advocate service stated in its 2014 annual report.\n\nThe agency added in the annual report that the Obama administration cancelled the program without a proper evaluation of its impact on low-income and disadvantaged people.\n\n\u201cThe IRS discontinued tax preparation services at TACs without properly evaluating the limitations of the most vulnerable taxpayer populations \u2013 the elderly, low income, rural and those not proficient in English.\u201d\n\nAlthough they earn low wages, today\u2019s low-income earners face a barrage of complex tax filings because they receive entitlement programs like the earned income tax credit that must be reported to the IRS.\n\nAnd for the first time, low-income earners now face extra tax filing requirements if they received health-care subsidies under Obamacare. About 7 million tax filers are affected.\n\n\u201cTaxes are intimidating for everyone. I suspect they are especially intimidating for people with lower education levels or lower-income families,\u201d said Elaine Maag, a senior research associate at the liberal Urban Institute, in an interview with TheDC.\n\nThe complexity demanded by Obamacare this year was so overwhelming, it caused IRS Commissioner John Koskinen to briefly consider the idea of delaying the tax season.\n\nHe lamented last October that this tax year was \u201cthe most complicated filing season before us in a long time, if ever.\u201d\n\nAs a replacement for the taxpayer assistance centers, the Obama administration has funded community service groups with $12 million in matching grants.\n\nThe administration has asked the volunteer groups to perform the same service as those offered by the Tax Assistance Centers. But the staffers are volunteers, not tax professionals.\n\nAs it happens, some of the largest grants issued under this program \u2014 called the IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program \u2014 have been awarded to groups that have political ties to the administration.\n\nSince early in the administration\u2019s first term, Obama officials sought to degrade the capabilities of the taxpayer assistance centers.\n\nThe U.S. Government Accountability Officer reported in December 2014 that between 2010 and 2013, the IRS continually reduced its field assistance staff to tax centers from 2,222 to 1,938.\n\n\u201cAt the same time IRS eliminated return preparation at TACs, taxpayers increased their use of volunteer sites,\u201d the GAO reported in the same report.\n\nThe IRS has attempted to makeup for the reduced service with an online program called \u201cFree File.\u201d But advocates retort that many low-income earners don\u2019t even have access to the Internet.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "rpollock", "description": "Business is good", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The Obama administration has quietly killed an IRS tax preparation program designed to help low-income and disadvantaged citizens, choosing instead to give millions of dollars to liberal groups for th", "title": "Exclusive: Obama Admin Kills Program That Helped Poor File Taxes, Sends Funding To Liberal Groups", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/03/15/exclusive-obama-admin-kills-program-that-helped-poor-file-taxes-sends-funding-to-liberal-groups/", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ObamaAdminIRSGetty.jpg", "height": 857}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Business is good", "title": "Exclusive: Obama Admin Kills Program That Helped Poor File Taxes, Sends Funding To Liberal Groups Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/03/15/exclusive-obama-admin-kills-program-that-helped-poor-file-taxes-sends-funding-to-liberal-groups/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ObamaAdminIRSGetty.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-03-15 22:01:21", "sailthru.title": "Exclusive: Obama Admin Kills Program That Helped Poor File Taxes, Sends Funding To Liberal Groups", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "rpollock", "sailthru.description": "The Obama administration has quietly killed an IRS tax preparation program designed to help low-income and disadvantaged citizens, choosing instead to give millions of dollars to liberal groups for th", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ObamaAdminIRSGetty.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda641\"", "article_summary": "Since early in the administration\u2019s first term, Obama officials sought to degrade the capabilities of the taxpayer assistance centers.\nUnlike other parts of the IRS that faced cutbacks, the taxpayer assistance program was left untouched by Congress.\nWithout fanfare, the administration has closed down the free walk-in services at hundreds of taxpayer assistance centers around the country.\nNotably, the taxpayer advocate service of the IRS has condemned the elimination of the tax assistance program.\nThe administration has asked the volunteer groups to perform the same service as those offered by the Tax Assistance Centers."}
