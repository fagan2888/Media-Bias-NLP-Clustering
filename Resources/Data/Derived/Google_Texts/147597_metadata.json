(NYSE:HNT) (\u201cHealth Net\u201d) announced today that it has received the consents necessary to effect certain amendments (the \u201cAmendments\u201d) to its 6.375% Senior Notes due 2017 (CUSIP No. 422248 AA2) (the \u201cNotes\u201d).\n\nThe Amendments (a) amend the defined term \u201cChange of Control\u201d in the Notes to provide that Health Net\u2019s merger (the \u201cMerger\u201d) with subsidiaries of Centene Corporation (\u201cCentene\u201d) as contemplated by the previously announced Agreement and Plan of Merger dated July 2, 2015, (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) will not constitute a Change of Control and (b) add to, amend, supplement or change certain other defined terms contained in the Notes related to the foregoing. The effectiveness of the Amendments is not a condition to the completion of the Merger, although the Merger remains subject to stockholder and regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\n\nHealth Net received the consents of holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes prior to the expiration time of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on August 12, 2015. As a result, Health Net and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. (the \u201cTrustee\u201d) have entered into the First Supplemental Indenture to the Indenture, dated as of May 18, 2007, by and among Health Net and the Trustee, which effects the Amendments (the \u201cSupplemental Indenture\u201d). The Supplemental Indenture became effective on August 12, 2015, and its provisions will become operative upon payment of the consent consideration described in the succeeding paragraph.\n\nHealth Net will make or cause to be made cash payments of $2.50 for each $1,000 in aggregate principal amount of Notes for which a consent was validly delivered prior to the expiration date.\n\nThese cash payments are expected to be paid on August 14, 2015. Health Net conducted the consent solicitation at the request of Centene pursuant to a covenant contained in the Merger Agreement. Centene has agreed that it will be responsible for all liabilities incurred by Health Net in connection with the consent solicitation, including all consent fees payable to holders of the Notes.\n\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC acted as solicitation agent, and D.F. King & Co., Inc. acted as the information and tabulation agent in connection with the consent solicitation.\n\nThis announcement is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any Notes or any other securities. This announcement is also not a solicitation of consents with respect to the Amendments or any securities.\n\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release and other public pronouncements contain certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of Health Net, Centene, and the combined businesses of Health Net and Centene and certain plans and objectives of Health Net and Centene with respect thereto, including the expected benefits of the consent solicitation and the Merger. These statements may include forward-looking statements for the period after completion of the consent solicitation and the Merger. Such forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward-looking statements often use words such as \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201chope,\u201d \u201caim,\u201d \u201ccontinue,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201ccould\u201d or \u201cshould\u201d or other words of similar meaning or the negative thereof. There are several factors that may cause actual plans and results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\nHealth Net\u2019s or Centene\u2019s ability to accurately predict and effectively manage health benefits and other operating expenses and reserves;\n\ncompetition;\n\nmembership and revenue projections;\n\ntiming of regulatory contract approval;\n\nchanges in health care practices;\n\nchanges in expected contract start dates;\n\nchanges in expected closing dates, estimated purchase price and accretion for acquisitions;\n\ninflation;\n\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\nprovider and state contract changes;\n\nnew technologies;\n\nadvances in medicine;\n\nreduction in provider payments by governmental payors;\n\nmajor epidemics;\n\ndisasters and numerous other factors affecting the delivery and cost of health care;\n\nthe expiration, cancellation or suspension of Health Net\u2019s or Centene\u2019s Medicare or Medicaid managed care contracts by federal or state governments;\n\nthe outcome of pending legal or regulatory proceedings;\n\navailability of debt and equity financing on favorable terms;\n\nthe expected closing date of the Merger;\n\nthe possibility that the expected synergies and value creation from the Merger will not be realized, or will not be realized within the expected time period;\n\nthe risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully;\n\ndisruption from the Merger making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships;\n\nthe risk that unexpected costs will be incurred;\n\nchanges in economic conditions, political conditions, and federal or state laws or regulations, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act and any regulations enacted thereunder;\n\nthe possibility that the Merger does not close, including, but not limited to, due to the failure to satisfy the closing conditions, including the receipt of approval of Health Net\u2019s stockholders and Centene\u2019s stockholders;\n\nthe risk that financing for the Merger may not be available on favorable terms;\n\nrisks and uncertainties discussed in the reports that Health Net and Centene have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d); and\n\nrisks and uncertainties set forth in the Consent Solicitation Statement.\n\nThese forward-looking statements reflect Health Net\u2019s and Centene\u2019s current views with respect to future events and are based on numerous assumptions and assessments made by Health Net and Centene in light of their experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, business strategies, operating environments, future developments and other factors they believe appropriate. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. The factors described in the context of such forward-looking statements in this press release could cause Health Net\u2019s and Centene\u2019s plans with respect to the consent solicitation and the Merger, actual results, performance or achievements, industry results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. Although it is believed that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct and persons reading this press release are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date of this press release.
