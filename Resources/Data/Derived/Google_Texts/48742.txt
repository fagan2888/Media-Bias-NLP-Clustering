A Kansas man is dead following a head-on crash over the weekend in southwest Kansas.

The crash happened around 6:45 a.m. Sunday on U54 just west of the town of Kismet in Seward County. The Kansas Highway Patrol reports a semi was eastbound when a westbound Ford SUV crossed the center line.

The semi tried to avoid the SUV and steer toward the should, but they collided.

The driver of the SUV, identified as 27-year-old Jon S. Wiggins of Dodge City, was pronounced dead at the scene. A 29-year-old passenger, 29-year-old Christopher Borges of Magnolia, Texas, was transported to a Wichita hospital for treatment.

There were two people in the semi, but neither was hurt.
