It\u2019s a real growth area.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cheaper and quicker to train a PA\u2019\u2019 than a doctor, said Chambers, a past president of the PA association.\n\nThe program at PCOM will be operated as a distant campus location of the organization\u2019s main physician assistant program in Philadelphia. The Georgia campus is in Suwanee, a northeastern suburb of Atlanta.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an exceptional opportunity for PCOM to expand its reach and provision of services to Georgia and the Southeast,\u201d Bryan Ginn, chief campus officer, said in a statement.\n\nThe campus is already helping to fill in the medical professional shortage, and is set to graduate 73 students with Doctor of Osteopathy (D.O.) degrees in May.\n\nUnlike a D.O. or an M.D., a PA is not a physician. But a PA has the training to perform many of the duties that doctors routinely handle.\n\nThe school\u2019s PA program will be developed in phases, and will ultimately enroll 30 to 50 students each year, officials said.\n\nThe state currently has four PA training programs, Chambers said. There are about 3,000 PAs now practicing in Georgia, he said.\n\nBarbara Myers, a spokeswoman for GA-PCOM, said the state has about 150 annual job openings for PAs, but current Georgia programs are only graduating 105 annually.\n\nA Rand Corp. study published this month said new roles for PAs and nurse practitioners may cut a predicted shortage of physicians by about 50 percent.\n\nThe number of new patients covered by health insurance is expected to surge due to the Affordable Care Act, which has led to dire predictions about a doctor shortage.\n\nBut using PAs and nurse practitioners in \u201cmedical homes\u201d \u2013 teams of professionals working together to coordinate care \u2013 can relieve the shortage of doctors by serving larger numbers of patients than a single physician can treat.\n\nPAs and nurse practitioners are key components of the medical home model, said Dr. Harry Heiman, a health policy expert at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta.\n\nGA-PCOM\u2019s plans call for approval of distant campus accreditation status by September 2015, which would allow the transition to a completely Georgia-based 26-month program in the fall of 2016.\n\nAccording to the American Academy of Physician Assistants, 60 new physician assistant programs were waiting for accreditation as of May, and they expect 10,000 new PAs by 2020, USA Today reported recently.\n\nSee more at: http://www.georgiahealthnews.com/2013/11/georgia-pas/#sthash.AtGvkbcr.dpuf", "article_metadata": {"meta_title": "New Program Will Train More Georgia Physician Assistants", "medium": "News", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Georgia Public Broadcasting", "description": "Physician assistants can help ease the shortage of primary care physicians, according to a study released earlier this month.
