The folks at The New York Times\u2019 The Upshot are saying it could be a tie. But Sam Wang of Princeton stands almost alone in forecasting that the Democrats will just barely hold their Senate majority.\n\nWang says he thinks the Democrats have a 70 percent chance of holding control of the Senate. As of Monday afternoon, Nate Silver thinks the Republicans have a 58 percent chance of winning, and The Upshot gives Republicans a 52 percent chance now calling it a tossup.\n\n\n\nWang is a 47-year-old professor of neuroscience and molecular biology at Princeton who uses advanced statistical methods to study how brain circuits work. He is the author of two books on the brain and his recent work focuses on autism. Politics, he says, is just kind of a hobby. \u201cIt\u2019s a relatively easy problem compared with the other things I do,\u201d he told me.\n\nHe started dabbling in politics in 2004 when he devised a computer program to aggregate and analyze polling data on the presidential race and in 2008 he founded the Princeton Election Consortium, a webpage featuring his modeling and blogs.\n\nIn 2012, his statistical analysis correctly predicted the presidential vote in 49 of 50 states and all 10 competitive Senate races including Montana and North Dakota\u2014which, he likes to point out, Nate Silver got wrong.\n\nA bit of a rivalry has developed between the two men. Wang refers to Silver as \u201cthe king of the nerds,\u201d and while it may take one to know one, Silver seems a little irritated by Wang encroaching on his turf. He has dissed Wang\u2019s Senate call and in a recent appearance on WNYC said Wang uses \u201carbitrary assumptions,\u201d which Wang calls \u201can out-and-out falsehood.\u201d\n\nSilver also said he \u201cwould like to place a large wager against that guy,\u201d not even bothering to mention Wang by name\u2014reminiscent of the \u201cI did not have sex with that woman\u201d sort of dismissal.\n\nWang\u2019s response: he was more accurate than Silver in 2012 and wants to \u201clet the math do the talking.\u201d If Silver turns out to be wrong about this election Wang told me Silver \u201ccan eat a bug.\u201d\n\nAs Brian Lehrer of WNYC said on his show Friday\u2014\u201cMath Fight!!!\u201d\n\nWhat Wang does differently than Silver and other prognosticators is base his analysis only on the polling data for each Senate race. Everyone else uses other factors including their own judgment to try to enhance the accuracy of their predictions including things like Barack Obama\u2019s popularity in different states, economic indicators, Democratic and Republican favorability, and turnout predictions.\n\nWang\u2019s model uses an 80-line meta-analysis program he designed that takes all of the available polls and aggregates them to get a statistical snapshot of what is happening.\n\nAlthough not every poll is reliable, Wang says even though individual pollsters can have biases and make mistakes, if you add all of the polls together they are very good at predicting outcomes.\n\n\u201cLet the statistics do their job and get out of their way and don\u2019t put a finger on the scale,\u201d says Wang in describing his method.\n\nAnd this year, says Wang, those polls right now are telling him that the Democrats are going to emerge from the election with a 50-seat majority, for a net loss of five. Since Vice President Joe Biden is the Senate\u2019s presiding officer and tie-breaking vote, the Democrats only have to win 50 seats to retain control while the Republicans have to win 51.\n\nThe top seven races\u2014North Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, Iowa, Arkansas, Alaska, and Kansas are all within two points right now, Wang says. He predicts Republicans will win four of those: Dan Sullivan defeating Sen. Mark Begich in Alaska; Tom Cotton beating Sen. Mark Pryor in Arkansas; Sen. Mary Landrieu losing to Bill Cassidy in Louisiana, and David Perdue beating Michelle Nunn in the open Georgia seat.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Kay Hagan will beat Thom Tillis in North Carolina.\n\nThere is also unanimity so far among Wang and his fellow handicappers about what is happening in the Colorado, New Hampshire, Kentucky, and Michigan races. Incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall in Colorado is expected to hold his seat. And despite all of the national media attention former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown has gotten by moving to New Hampshire and winning the Republican nomination there, Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen currently leads that race.\n\nWang and the others believe Democrat Gary Peters will win in Michigan, keeping that seat in the Democratic column, and that Republican Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who wants to change his title from minority to majority leader, is safe for reelection.\n\n\n\nThe other two states that aren\u2019t really in play but involve Republican gains are South Dakota and Montana.\n\nKansas is the race where Wang differs in his prediction from Five Thirty Eight, The Upshot and others and on which his call about control of the Senate depends. Wang was onto this one before most others. He\u2019s been doing political analysis for The New Yorker online this year, and in late August, he wrote that he thought control of the Senate could hinge on the candidacy of Kansas Independent Greg Orman, who is running against longtime GOP Senator Pat Roberts.\n\nThat assessment was based on a Public Policy Polling report that showed Orman leading Roberts by 10 points in a head-to-head matchup. Wang pointed out that Roberts\u2019 approval rating was lower than Barack Obama\u2019s in Kansas and suggested if Democrat Chad Taylor dropped out of the race, which he subsequently did on Sept 3, Orman had a good chance of defeating Roberts.\n\nThe latest Kansas poll shows Orman with a one point lead over Roberts\u2014a virtual tie\u2014with Taylor drawing as much as 10 percent of the vote (the state\u2019s Republican secretary of state ruled that Roberts\u2019 name must stay on the ballot a decision Taylor has appealed to the Kansas Supreme Court).\n\nWang predicts an Orman win, while most other analysts all have Kansas at least leaning Republican.\n\nAdd all the above up, and you get to a 50-50 Democratic advantage. But there\u2019s a catch: The 50 would include those seats held by independent senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, who currently caucus with the Democrats.King said several months ago he would decide after the election whether to switch sides. It would also include Orman, who has declined to say which party he would support if he wins but who has indicated he would join whichever side has the majority. If Republicans only manage to pick up four or five seats, King and Orman could become independent kingmakers and have the power to determine which party controls the Senate.\n\nIt should be noted that Wang has incorrectly forecast Democratic victories before. In 2004, an extremely close presidential race, the polls Wang analyzed showed that George W. Bush would win, but Wang said he second guessed the analysis and tried to factor in the undecided votes, flipping his prediction to a John Kerry victory.\n\nHe vividly remembers Shirley Tilghman, then the president of Princeton, asking for his prediction. Wang told her it would be Kerry. Wang calls the flub \u201ca humbling mistake\u2026Now I don\u2019t shoot off my mouth unless there are numbers involved.\u201d\n\nHe also revealed that he was up for tenure that year and was extremely relieved it didn\u2019t depend on his political forecasting.\n\nAnother prediction he got wrong involved the 2012 congressional election. In September of that year, Wang said he thought Democrats could win back control of the House of Representatives. Wang explains he made the mistake because at first he didn\u2019t realize how significant Republican structural advantages were after redistricting. \u201cI backtracked on that pretty soon thereafter. This is better than sticking with a wrong analysis,\u201d he says.\n\nDespite his intellectual firepower, Wang, who uses phrases like topsy-turvy and describes himself as a \u201cpolitically inclined quantitative nerd,\u201d is modest, self-effacing, and unfailingly polite. When sending a message from his phone the signature reads \u201cSent by handheld. Excuse brevity please!\u201d\n\nThe son of Taiwanese immigrants, he grew up in California and earned his PhD in neuroscience at Stanford. He is the co-author of two best-selling books\u2014\u201cWelcome To Your Brain: Why You Lose Your Car Keys But Never Forget How To Drive\u201d and \u201cWelcome To Your Child\u2019s Brain: How The Mind Develops From Conception To College.\u201d\n\nFor this election cycle, Wang has also taken a look at gubernatorial races and has come up with a model to explain why some Republican governors in swing states could have trouble getting reelected. Those governors who stalled or blocked implementation of the Affordable Care Act are the ones Wang thinks are in the most trouble, including Scott Walker in Wisconsin, Sam Brownback in Kansas, Tom Corbett in Pennsylvania, and Paul LePage in Maine.\n\nWang thinks Medicaid expansion is a \u201cproxy variable\u201d that is predictive of extreme conservative stands on other issues as well that have hurt those governors. He points out that Republican governors in Michigan, Ohio, and New Mexico who accepted Obamacare and Medicaid expansion look to be in pretty good shape for reelection, although Michigan is close.\n\n\u201cI think no statistical model is perfect,\u201d says Jennifer Duffy who follows Senate and governor\u2019s races for the Cook Political Report. \u201cThere are subjective factors that can\u2019t be factored in.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Princeton University, Republican Party, u.s. poli, United States Senate, Democratic Party", "publicationDate": 201409160945, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "Princeton University, Republican Party, US Politics, United States Senate, Democratic Party", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Meet the One Numbers-Cruncher Who Foresees Democrats Holding the Senate", "tags": "entity:facility/princeton_university,entity:organization/republican_party,topic:politics,entity:organization/united_states_senate,entity:organization/democratic_party", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "He\u2019s not as well-known as Nate Silver, but Princeton\u2019s Sam Wang has a method, too, and he sees Democrats holding (barely) the upper chamber.", "title": "Meet the One Numbers-Cruncher Who Foresees Democrats Holding the Senate", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/16/meet-the-one-numbers-cruncher-who-foresees-democrats-holding-the-senate.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/09/16/meet-the-one-numbers-cruncher-who-foresees-democrats-holding-the-senate/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1410894245229.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "He\u2019s not as well-known as Nate Silver, but Princeton\u2019s Sam Wang has a method, too, and he sees Democrats holding (barely) the upper chamber.", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Linda Killian", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2014-09-16T09:45:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/linda-killianhtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/09/16/meet-the-one-numbers-cruncher-who-foresees-democrats-holding-the-senate", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Meet the One Numbers-Cruncher Who Foresees Democrats Holding the Senate\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/09/16/meet-the-one-numbers-cruncher-who-foresees-democrats-holding-the-senate.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/09/16/meet-the-one-numbers-cruncher-who-foresees-democrats-holding-the-senate/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47029808.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/09/16/meet-the-one-numbers-cruncher-who-foresees-democrats-holding-the-senate\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-16T09:45:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Linda Killian\",\"tags\":[\"princeton_university\",\"republican_party\",\"politics\",\"united_states_senate\",\"democratic_party\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/l/linda-killian", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee85\"", "article_summary": "Wang says he thinks the Democrats have a 70 percent chance of holding control of the Senate.\nBut Sam Wang of Princeton stands almost alone in forecasting that the Democrats will just barely hold their Senate majority.\nIn September of that year, Wang said he thought Democrats could win back control of the House of Representatives.\nAgainst the GrainHe\u2019s not as well-known as Nate Silver, but Princeton\u2019s Sam Wang has a method, too, and he sees Democrats holding (barely) the upper chamber.\nWang predicts an Orman win, while most other analysts all have Kansas at least leaning Republican."}
