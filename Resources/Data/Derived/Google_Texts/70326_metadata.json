Yet it delighted the project's backers who include congressional Republicans as well as some of Obama's Democrats up for reelection this November.\n\nMcDonough called the State Department review \"one of many important inputs into the process.\"\n\n\"What the president's role is now is to protect this process from politics, let the experts, the expert agencies and the cabinet secretaries make their assessments both of the study that was put in on Friday as well as its impact on the national interest,\" McDonough said.\n\n\"So we'll resolve that over the coming period of time,\" McDonough said.\n\nLouisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, a Republican and an outspoken proponent of the project, told CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday there was no reason for Obama to oppose the project \"unless it's just purely ideological.\"\n\n\"This goes to an absolutely critical issue, cheap, affordable domestic energy (which) is an absolute critical component for us reviving our manufacturing-based economy,\" Jindal said.\n\n\"This is a no-brainer,\" the governor said.\n\nAlso on HuffPost: State of the Union 2014 State of the Union 2014\n\n1 of 35 President Barack Obama US President Barack Obama greets members of the military top brass as he arrives to deliver his State of the Union address before a joint session of Congress on January 28, 2014 at the Capitol in Washington, DC.
