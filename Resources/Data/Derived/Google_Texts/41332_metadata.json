People don\u2019t really know how to go about signing up and getting the best policy for them, so this RV came out of that realization that many people cannot or don\u2019t know how to surf the Internet and do what\u2019s best for them.\u201d\n\nWhen people come to the RV, they can have their questions answered and can also present their health situations so agents can help identify plans that fit their life best, as well as sign up for BlueCross BlueShield or BlueChoice policies at the site, Scoles said.\n\nThe company offers 53 health plans to choose from either through the federally facilitated Marketplace at healthcare.gov or through private insurance.\n\nOpen enrollment for individual health insurance began Nov. 1, and Thursday is the last day for payment to ensure coverage for plans effective Jan. 1. Those who purchased a health insurance plan with a Jan. 1 effective date have until 11:59 p.m. on Thursday to submit payment for their first month\u2019s premium if they are paying online, Scoles said.\n\nThis payment deadline applies to all individual and family ACA plans bought either on or off the Marketplace. The second enrollment deadline is Jan. 15.\n\nScoles said one of the things that is most important to remember for next year is that fines for those who are uninsured double and can be as high as $695 per household adult and $347 per household minor, or 2.5 percent of combined household income. Additionally, he recommends subsidy recipients revalidate their subsidy for next year, and he does not encourage those who are insured to simply auto renew.\n\n\u201cTheir health care needs may have changed for 2016,\u201d he said.\n\nThose who stop by the RV should bring their driver\u2019s license or some form of ID and Social Security numbers for each members of the household they want covered.\n\nPlanet Fitness is located at 2531 Whiskey Road, and RV manager Steve Berzins said the RV could close as early as 4:30 p.m. on Thursday.\n\nFor more information about BlueCross BlueShield, visit www.southcarolinablues.com and www.blueoptionsc.com or find an SC Blue retail store at www.scblueretailcenters.com.
