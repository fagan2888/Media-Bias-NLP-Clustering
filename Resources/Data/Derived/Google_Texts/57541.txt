SAN FRANCISCO (KRON) — Smartphone thefts have reached epidemic levels around the Bay Area to the point where people are warned to always be aware of their surroundings.

On Wednesday night, KRON obtained exclusive video of a brutal attack caught on camera in San Francisco’s Union Square. And KRON’s Stanley Roberts went along with police, as they raided the home of the suspected thieves.

In this edition of People Behaving Badly, and a story you will only see on KRON, Stanley shows a brutal mugging, an eventual arrest, and why you should always be aware of your surroundings.
