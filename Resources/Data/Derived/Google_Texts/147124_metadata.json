But, addiction specialists say the crackdown has had some unintended consequences.\n\n\n\nSherry Benjamin\u2019s story is a pretty good snapshot of what life has been like for a lot of the state\u2019s prescription pill addicts.\n\nBenjamin moved to Fort Myers from Ohio a couple years ago. Before a rash of surgeries, she said she had never abused drugs of any kind.\n\n\u201cI was a soccer mom,\u201d she explained. \u201cI did everything for my kids. I was involved in church-- everything. And then I had surgery on my stomach and then 12 surgeries later, I was highly addicted to many different pain medications.\u201d\n\nBut, Benjamin said her doctors kept prescribing her a slew of addictive pain killers.\n\n\u201cIt started off that they were giving me Vicodin,\u201d she said. \u201cThen it went up to Percocet and then I had foot surgery and they gave me Oxycodone, OxyContin.\u201d\n\nShe said she eventually had more surgeries to address stomach problems. That led to morphine and Fentanyl patches\u2014on top of what she was already taking.\n\n\u201cTo me, it was like they were giving me more pills than I really needed to have,\u201d Benjamin said. \u201cI was in serious pain all the time. I had to have it. You know, I felt like I was dying if I didn\u2019t have them.\u201d\n\nFor two and half years Benjamin said her life was out of control. She said her pill addiction took a toll on her marriage and her family.\n\n\u201cIt was hell,\u201d Benjamin said. \u201cI mean, it was a hard life. It was just a struggle when you don\u2019t have them and you wake up in the morning and you are sick and you are in pain. And it\u2019s not even so much your body being in pain from pain, it\u2019s pain from the pills, you know, not having them \u2013 the withdrawals and all that.\u201d\n\nAnd for a while, there was a culture in Florida that was helping her keep up that addiction. The state had lax regulations for prescription pain killers. So-called \u201cpill mills,\u201d usually known as pain management clinics, covered the state. According to a CDC report, by 2010, Florida was home to 98 of 100 doctors prescribing the highest quantities of Oxycodone in the U.S., which was the most widely prescribed pain killer in the country.\n\nThe CDC also reported that from 2003 to 2009, drug overdose deaths in Florida increased 61 percent. Experts said the increases were caused by opioid painkillers like Oxycodone.\n\nKevin Lewis, the President and CEO of SalusCare in Fort Myers\u2014the largest substance abuse counseling provider in the area, said he had a front row seat to Florida\u2019s prescription pill crisis. Lewis explained that a situation like Benjamin\u2019s was all too common during those years.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty clear that it was capitalism run amok where people saw the opportunity to make money and were prescribing ungodly amounts of prescription medication,\u201d he said. \u201cYou had people who were early exposures\u2014who had not historically struggled with addiction issues. But their brain chemistry is such that when they are exposed to these very powerful prescription opiates, they become dependent and addicted.\u201d\n\nBut in 2011, state officials identified prescription pill abuse as the leading public health problem in Florida. State lawmakers cracked down on the state\u2019s high-quantity prescribers. Law enforcement shuttered pill mills all over the state.\n\nBenjamin said for her it was a dramatic shift.\n\n\u201cIt was very hard to get my prescriptions filled,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would give me a hard time. It\u2019s kind of like someone feeding you a huge buffet and then cutting you off from food altogether.\u201d\n\nAnd this crackdown really worked. According to the latest CDC report, prescription pill overdose deaths fell by 23 percent in Florida from 2010 to 2012. In the same period, Oxycodone deaths fell by more than half.\n\nLewis said it\u2019s a good thing prescription pills aren\u2019t as easy to get anymore.\n\n\u201cOn the flip side of that, we can\u2019t lose sight of the fact that addiction is a disease and individuals that have now become dependent on opiates are going to seek out other opiates which will include things like heroin in order to meet that physiological dependence they have,\u201d he said.\n\nThat is exactly what happened to Benjamin. When she couldn\u2019t find pills anymore, she turned to crack cocaine and heroin. And this trend is something the CDC reported, too. Its statistics show while pill deaths went down in Florida, heroin related-deaths went up.\n\nFor Benjamin, things got a lot worse before they got better. Her drug-seeking landed her in jail. But, she said, that actually ended up saving her life. She was put in a program called drug court, which provided rehabilitation services. Benjamin said she and her husband tried to get her into rehab several times during those years, but they couldn\u2019t afford it.\n\nNow, she\u2019s working hard on her recovery and she is doing really well.\n\n\u201cSince December when I got home my life has changed so much,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a great job. My kids respect me.\u201d\n\nBenjamin said she hopes her story will serve as a warning to others about the dangers of prescription pain killers. And Lewis warns more people will abuse heroin in the state if officials don't get serious about tackling all kinds of substance addiction.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/floridas-pain-killer-crackdown-has-results-and-unintended-consequences", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201411/331738710.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Florida's Pain Killer Crackdown Has Results And Unintended Consequences"}, "story_id": 331734496, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Ashley Lopez", "org_id": 399, "dc": {"title": "Florida&#039;s Pain Killer Crackdown Has Results And Unintended Consequences"}, "nid": 7135, "datePublished": "2014-07-16", "keywords": "pain pills, pain pill, oxycodone, CDC, addiction", "wordCount": 1177, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd672d\"", "article_summary": "My kids respect me.\u201dBenjamin said she hopes her story will serve as a warning to others about the dangers of prescription pain killers.\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports prescription pill related deaths in Florida fell sharply in the past few years.\nShe said her pill addiction took a toll on her marriage and her family.\nAccording to the latest CDC report, prescription pill overdose deaths fell by 23 percent in Florida from 2010 to 2012.\nSherry Benjamin\u2019s story is a pretty good snapshot of what life has been like for a lot of the state\u2019s prescription pill addicts."}
