A leading national pro-life group has lined up to support pro-life Senate candidate David Perdue as he takes on pro-abortion Michelle Nunn in Georgia’s competitive Senate race.

The National Right to Life Committee today endorsed David Perdue for election to the U.S. Senate for the general election.

“David Perdue has been a strong defender of human life on the campaign trail,” said Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life. “David Perdue will be a strong pro-life voice in the U.S. Senate.”

Perdue has pledged his support for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act – groundbreaking legislation to protect unborn children at 20 weeks, a point by which the unborn child is capable of experiencing great pain when being killed by dismemberment or other late abortion methods. He has also stated his opposition to, and called for the repeal of, Obamacare – a law that created a national program of massive federal subsidies for insurance plans that cover abortion, and imposes rationing of lifesaving medical care. He has stated, “We should promote a culture that values life and protects the innocent, especially the unborn.”

Perdue’s strong pro-life position stands in sharp contrast with his pro-abortion Democrat opponent Michelle Nunn. Nunn supports the current policy of abortion on demand, which allows abortion for any reason, and has expressed her support for Obamacare. Nunn has also received the endorsement and support of the pro-abortion political committee EMILY’S List.

“For Georgians concerned with the right to life and the protection of the most vulnerable members of our human family, David Perdue is the only candidate for U.S. Senate who will represent their pro-life views,” said Tobias.
