Patrick McHenry said during a visit to a local manufacturing plant Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t vote for it originally. I think there\u2019s a better way forward and hopefully this fall we\u2019ll be able to push for that better way forward,\u201d McHenry told more than 60 employees of Thermo Fisher Scientific, which makes scientific instruments.\n\nThe court is considering whether to end payment of subsidies to purchase insurance to people who live in states, like North Carolina, that did not set up their own exchanges where people can shop for health insurance. A decision is expected no later than June.\n\nMcHenry said a rewrite of the ACA would return \u201cto the basic principle of if you like your health care plan you can keep it,\u201d allow consumers to buy health insurance plans offered in other states, enhance competition and lift restrictions on the types of plans that are offered through the law.\n\nAny new legislation should retain the ACA\u2019s protections for those who have pre-existing conditions and are seeking health care, said McHenry, a Lincoln County Republican who is House chief deputy whip.\n\n\u201cBut there are better, more efficient ways to achieve it and legislation we address in the fall will have components that will do that,\u201d McHenry said after a plant tour and meeting with workers.\n\nMcHenry noted in his remarks to employees that he had voted multiple times to repeal the law, but he did not advocate Tuesday a return to the status quo before the ACA was approved in 2010.\n\n\u201cCongress will have to rewrite the law and address this in a pretty wide-scale way,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said legislation Republicans pushed in 2009 and 2010 would likely be a basis for whatever GOP plan emerges. It would have allowed buying insurance plans across state lines, encouraged small businesses to band together to buy insurance and enhanced state \u201chigh-risk pools\u201d that would provide insurance for people with pre-existing conditions or chronic illnesses, he said.\n\nThe fact that the court has yet to rule means there are some unknowns, McHenry said, but, \u201cWe\u2019re working diligently to be sure we have a package\u201d to deal with issues a decision against the ACA would present.\n\nOn other issues, McHenry:\n\n\u2022Said that while President Barack Obama is \u201con to something very interesting\u201d with his call to make it free to attend community college, \u201cIt\u2019s not the most important thing we should be doing right now,\u201d partly because it is \u201cvery affordable\u201d in North Carolina already.\n\n\u2022Backed funding for scientific research through the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\u201cThat is a high priority. It\u2019s basic, sound science that may not lead to the market return that you need for a big pharmaceutical company to invest in that type of research,\u201d he said.\n\nNIH-backed projects are a significant market for Massachusetts-based Thermo Fisher, which makes scientific instruments at its plant on Aiken Road and has a major back office and technical support operation in Biltmore Park. The two together employ about 1,000.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://avlne.ws/1C2IKOL", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "\u201cI think there\u2019s a better way forward\u201d on health care, U.S. Rep.
