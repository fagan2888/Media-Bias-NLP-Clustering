For people to be able to buy and own tanks?!\"\n\nThat argument and question are red herrings. The average citizen is not trying to own or buy tanks (even though there are legal ways to do it), but an anti-gun billionaire dedicated to taking away your Second Amendment rights, just bought one.\n\nCo-founder of Microsoft Paul Allen has dumped hundreds-of-thousands of dollars into anti-gun campaigns and now, he's the proud owner of a WWII Nazi tank. Chris Egar over at Guns.com has more:\n\nThe tank in question, a Panzerkampfwagen IV Ausf. H, commonly referred to as a Panzer IV, was allegedly sold in July for $2.5 million to a foundation tied to Allen. However, attention over the deal, which is now tied up in a lawsuit over non-delivery, has now earned Allen the scorn of gun rights groups when compared to the tech pioneer\u2019s half-million dollar donation to help push gun control ballot initiative I-594.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile Paul Allen is eager to get his hands on a genuine weapon of war \u2026 he is all-too-willing to support a measure that throws obstacles in the way of law-abiding citizens who may just want to borrow or buy a firearm from a friend or in-law,\u201d said Alan Gottlieb, chairman of the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, in a statement Friday. \u201cHow silly is that?\u201d\n\nI thought \"weapons of war\" belonged on the battlefield, Mr. Allen?\n\nYou just can't make this stuff up.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hypocrisy. .05/26/2016 5:16:27AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Hypocrisy.", "title": "- Huh: Anti-Gun Billionaire Buys a Nazi Tank", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2014/09/15/huh-antigun-billionaire-buys-a-nazi-tank-n1892000", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/120/2013-04-30T112506Z_1_CBRE93T0VT900_RTROPTP_3_ALLEN-INVESTMENTS.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Hypocrisy.", "title": "- Huh: Anti-Gun Billionaire Buys a Nazi Tank", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2014/09/15/huh-antigun-billionaire-buys-a-nazi-tank-n1892000", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/120/2013-04-30T112506Z_1_CBRE93T0VT900_RTROPTP_3_ALLEN-INVESTMENTS.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Huh: Anti-Gun Billionaire Buys a Nazi Tank, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda775\"", "article_summary": "If you've paid attention at all to the gun control debate over the past two decades, you've certainly heard the argument from gun control activists, \"What do you want?\nCo-founder of Microsoft Paul Allen has dumped hundreds-of-thousands of dollars into anti-gun campaigns and now, he's the proud owner of a WWII Nazi tank.\nChris Egar over at Guns.com has more:The tank in question, a Panzerkampfwagen IV Ausf.\nH, commonly referred to as a Panzer IV, was allegedly sold in July for $2.5 million to a foundation tied to Allen.\n\u201cHow silly is that?\u201dI thought \"weapons of war\" belonged on the battlefield, Mr. Allen?"}
