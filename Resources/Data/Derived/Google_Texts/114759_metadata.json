It was packed with upscale professionals of diverse generations, including lobbyists and a senator.\n\nI told Dean, who is forever associated with our greatest political scandal, Watergate, how I\u2019d seen Kathleen Sebelius ambling to a Union Station taxi line all by her lonesome that morning.\n\nA few hours later, in a congressman\u2019s waiting room, I\u2019d seen an otherwise unrecognized James Woolsey all by his lonesome.\n\nThey are, like Dean, all part of the city\u2019s Army of Formers.\n\nShe may now always be the maligned \u201cformer secretary of Health and Human Services\u201d during the Obamacare website debacle. Woolsey will be a \u201cformer CIA director,\u201d which is how my congressman friend referred to him.\n\nOnce they traveled with large retinues of security and others. They were on the \u201cA\u201d social list in a town that, perhaps more than any other, equates status with title.\n\nNow they\u2019ve entered a certain hazy, undefined twilight zone between the past and present.\n\nIn most cases, it almost doesn\u2019t matter what one does after government service \u2014 how much money they make or what achievements or troubles they experience. They\u2019re often locked in time as what they were.\n\nFor a former senator I had lunch with recently, the onetime high rank had become an avenue to improbable riches. You trade on your past and market your wisdom about the town\u2019s supposedly mysterious inner workings.\n\nSome can\u2019t manage to leave; the economic incentives are too alluring, especially as the law-lobbying-consulting world has exploded. One firm just reported earning $8.6 million in lobbying revenue in the year\u2019s second quarter. It\u2019s a world of hefty six-figure and even seven-figure annual retainers, often paid by companies (or even foreign dictators) merely seeking to maintain a legislative or regulatory status quo.\n\nSome won\u2019t leave; an incestuous elite culture has sucked them in, and the district or state they represented now seems such distant, small potatoes. They might keep a summer place back there.\n\nThen there\u2019s Dean, who had to leave and is now 75, though he\u2019s testament to the potential of charting a new, even rehabilitative, course after exiting.\n\nThe history of Dean might have been known to a few geezers at Joe\u2019s, whose marble columns, Palladian windows and clientele would, suggested the Washington Post dining review, suit the opening montage of \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d\n\nHe was the young and dashing White House counsel with a knockout wife (they\u2019re still married) who testified against Nixon and others in congressional hearings that riveted the nation. He was convicted of obstruction of justice and sentenced to the four months already spent in the witness protection program. A felony conviction meant losing his law license.\n\nHe moved to Los Angeles and morphed into a best-selling author, respected commentator and teacher of ethics courses nationwide that lawyers attend to maintain their state license as part of continuing legal education mandates.\n\nHis soon-to-be-published tenth book, \u201cThe Nixon Defense,\u201d is a prodigious effort that required transcribing hundreds of hours of Watergate-related Nixon White House recordings.\n\nAs we discussed Washington\u2019s cultural anthropology, he recalled how John Ehrlichman, a key Nixon aide who served time for the Watergate cover-up, plaintively asked Nixon if he could still use the presidential retreat at Camp David after his forced resignation.\n\n\u201cThe perk was important,\u201d said Dean.\n\nDean acknowledges vast change in the city: its demographics, its look, its unprecedented political polarization and its ever-more-entrenched lobbying-consulting sector.\n\nBut he finds that a certain essence remains. There\u2019s a lack of genuine friendships. Pragmatism and utility rule. It\u2019s not who you are as a person, he says, \u201cit\u2019s what you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat hasn\u2019t changed a bit.\u201d\n\nWhen Ehrlichman and H.R. Haldeman, the other key Nixon aide and co-conspirator, were booted, \u201cthey didn\u2019t have a friend in town.\u201d\n\nOf course, they were total jerks, unlike Kathleen Sebelius, whose sin was not criminality.\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d said Dean, \u201cI bet if she goes to a party tonight and stands in a corner, there\u2019ll be maybe two people who go up to her.\u201d\n\njwarren@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "James Warren", "twitter": {"description": "Warren: John Dean wasn\u2019t recognized as we sat in Washington\u2019s new power restaurant Thursday night and contemplated the vagaries and transient essence of clout in the capital.", "title": "Where the has-beens roam", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/has-beens-roam-article-1.1880556", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1880555.1406326033!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/dn02389.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "James Warren", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-07-27T08:30:00", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/has-beens-roam-article-1.1880556", "parsely-title": "Where the has-beens roam", "sailthru.date": "2014-07-27T04:30:00-0400", "sailthru.title": "Where the has-beens roam", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1880555.1406326033!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/dn02389.jpg", "description": "Warren: John Dean wasn\u2019t recognized as we sat in Washington\u2019s new power restaurant Thursday night and contemplated the vagaries and transient essence of clout in the capital.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "Warren: John Dean wasn\u2019t recognized as we sat in Washington\u2019s new power restaurant Thursday night and contemplated the vagaries and transient essence of clout in the capital.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "Warren: John Dean wasn\u2019t recognized as we sat in Washington\u2019s new power restaurant Thursday night and contemplated the vagaries and transient essence of clout in the capital.", "title": "Where the has-beens roam", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/has-beens-roam-article-1.1880556", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1880555.1406326033!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/dn02389.jpg", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "James Warren", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1880555.1406326033!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/dn02389.jpg"}, "article_summary": "His soon-to-be-published tenth book, \u201cThe Nixon Defense,\u201d is a prodigious effort that required transcribing hundreds of hours of Watergate-related Nixon White House recordings.\n\u201cThis place represents money power, not so much governmental power,\u201d Dean surmised as he scanned the 12,000-square-foot main room at Joe\u2019s Stone Crab.\nA few hours later, in a congressman\u2019s waiting room, I\u2019d seen an otherwise unrecognized James Woolsey all by his lonesome.\nShe may now always be the maligned \u201cformer secretary of Health and Human Services\u201d during the Obamacare website debacle.\nThey were on the \u201cA\u201d social list in a town that, perhaps more than any other, equates status with title."}
