The birds of prey swooped down after the \"peace\" doves flew from the open window in the Apostolic Palace.\n\nOne dove broke free from the gull, after losing a few feathers in the fray. A crow pecked the other before both doves escaped and flew away. Their ultimate fate is unknown.\n\nThankfully, the Pope and children had walked away before the fly-by birding.\n\nDoves as Judeo-Christian symbols of peace date back to biblical times. In the Book of Genesis, a dove returns to the ark-maker Noah with an olive branch, letting him know that the flood had receded.\n\nIn the New Testament, the Holy Spirit descends \"like a dove\" on Jesus after his baptism, according to the Gospel of Matthew. Centuries of Christian art thereafter have use doves to symbolize the third member of the Holy Trinity, along with God and Jesus.\n\nJust before releasing the doves, the Pope had offered prayers for Ukraine, the site of pitched civil strife, and some say the dove-attack portends poorly for Eastern European nation.\n\nBad omen? @DavidKenner Pope Francis's peace doves being attacked by crows,in the world's least hopeful symbolism ever pic.twitter.com/Nki2JbJMV6 \u2014 notanna1AnnaNotaro (@notanna1) January 26, 2014\n\nOthers took a more humorous approach.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By\u00a0Daniel Burke, Belief Blog Co-editor (CNN) Talk about your angry birds.
