Mr. Valde said he had begun to wonder how Mr. Cruz would replace the Affordable Care Act \u2013 and how it would impact people like Mr. Gaffney.\n\n\u201cAfter I saw him there, I didn\u2019t say a word. I wished I had asked him something,\u201d Mr. Valde, a supporter of Hillary Clinton, recalled in a phone interview Sunday. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I speak up and say, \u2018How do you take care of the Mark Gaffneys of the world?\u2019\u201d\n\nSo, on Saturday, Mr. Valde got his chance \u2013 and took it \u2013 during an intense exchange with Mr. Cruz in a middle school cafeteria in Hubbard, Iowa. Mr. Valde described how Mr. Gaffney, a barber in Arizona, worked for himself and never had a paid vacation day, and used the health care law, at last, to buy insurance. He began feeling ill and went to a doctor, and soon learned he had terminal cancer, Mr. Valde told Mr. Cruz. The room went silent.\n\n\u201cMark never had health care until Obamacare,\u201d Mr. Valde told Mr. Cruz, \u201cWhat are you going to replace it with?\u201d\n\nMr. Cruz, during a back-and-forth, expressed condolences, while also deriding the law as a job-killer that has made insurance premiums \u201cskyrocket.\u201d\n\nThe exchange became a highly discussed moment on the campaign trail during the final days before the Iowa caucuses. Later Saturday, Mrs. Clinton mentioned it during a rally at a high school, criticizing how Mr. Cruz does not offer an alternative to the health care law.\n\nMr. Valde and his wife, Jill, Mr. Gaffney\u2019s sister, attended a Bill Clinton rally on Sunday and chatted with Mr. Clinton in the rope line, with the former president telling them that he had heard about the question posed to Mr. Cruz.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe Valdes said they were surprised by the attention, with word of the exchange getting back to Mr. Gaffney\u2019s friends hundreds of miles away. \u201cWhen Mark\u2019s friends saw it in Arizona, they said, \u2018Thanks for bringing it up,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Valde said.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have repeatedly tried to repeal the health care law, which they see as an expensive government program, but President Obama has vetoed their attempts. The law is unpopular in public opinion polls, and Mr. Cruz and virtually all the other Republican candidates have vowed to get rid of it if elected.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Valde said in the interview that before the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Gaffney had been either uninsured or lightly insured, making it prohibitively expensive for him to see doctors.\n\n\u201cHe was having financial problems and the last thing he could do was pay to take care of himself,\u201d Mrs. Valde said. \u201cHe\u2019d say: \u2018It\u2019s just too expensive. I can\u2019t afford to go.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen coverage under the health care law went into effect in 2014, Mrs. Valde said, she suggested to her brother that he should sign up, and he eventually did, though she did not know precisely when.\n\nIt was last spring when they visited him that they noticed that he appeared unwell, and they encouraged him to see a doctor. By summer, he told them that he had terminal cancer, and he died on Aug. 16 at age 58.\n\nThe Valdes said that they did not believe that earlier access to the health insurance necessarily would have saved Mr. Gaffney\u2019s life, but that his plight convinced them that the access to coverage he ultimately obtained would be important for others. They were grateful, they said, that Mr. Gaffney was eventually able to see a doctor.\n\n\u201cWhat about people like him? Mr. Valde said. \u201cPeople could be saved.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThere are a lot of Mark Gaffneys out there.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "Political News, Now.", "title": "First Draft", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/01/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytdesign/2014/politics/logo-flag-150.png", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/2016/02/01", "PT": "Blogs", "BN": "first-draft", "CG": "Politics", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "robots": "noodp", "sourceApp": "blogs", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-02012016.jsonp", "keywords": "politics, congress, midterms, elections, 2014, 2016, house, senate, advertising, political advertising, campaign finance, senator, Obama, Boehner, Clinton, Hillary, Hillary Clinton, Reid, McConnell, Christie, Paul, Washington, capitol", "ad_sensitivity": "noxxl", "article": {"section": "Politics"}, "nyt_active_day": 0, "SCG": "First Draft", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He began feeling ill and went to a doctor, and soon learned he had terminal cancer, Mr. Valde told Mr. Cruz.\nI wished I had asked him something,\u201d Mr. Valde, a supporter of Hillary Clinton, recalled in a phone interview Sunday.\nMr. Valde said he had begun to wonder how Mr. Cruz would replace the Affordable Care Act \u2013 and how it would impact people like Mr. Gaffney.\nMr. Valde said.\n\u201cWhen Mark\u2019s friends saw it in Arizona, they said, \u2018Thanks for bringing it up,\u2019\u201d Mrs. Valde said."}
