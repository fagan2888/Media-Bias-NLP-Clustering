Richard Pan (D-Sacramento), who announced a bill earlier this month to do just that. When he made the announcement, Pan repeatedly spoke of wanting to increase vaccination rates.\n\nIt sounds so good: Just wipe out the option to refuse vaccines, and vaccination rates will improve.\n\nBut is abolishing the personal belief exemption \u2014 a choice that permits parents to lawfully send their children to school unvaccinated \u2014 the best way to accomplish that goal?\n\n\u201cI think focusing on the parental-choice issue risks provoking a counterproductive backlash,\u201d Professor Brendan Nyhan told me in an interview. He\u2019s a political scientist at Dartmouth whose research focuses on misperceptions in politics and health care.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty easy to imagine that people who are ardently opposed to vaccinating their children are also going to be ardently opposed to a law that removes their personal choice.\n\nTightening Rules\n\n\u201cRather than eliminating choice,\u201d Nyhan says, \u201cwe alter the administrative procedures to reflect the cost that going unvaccinated affects the community.\u201d\n\nThose administrative procedures have to do with tightening the rules around how people can obtain an exemption from vaccination.\n\nBacking up for a moment, California is one of 20 states that permits a philosophical exemption from vaccines. In addition, all states, except two, permit a religious exemption. Only West Virginia and Mississippi require all children to be vaccinated, except those who cannot be immunized for a medical reasons.\n\nUntil this school year, it was easier in California to opt out of vaccines than it was to vaccinate your children. While it\u2019s state law that all kindergartners be vaccinated to attend any school statewide \u2014 public, private or religious \u2014 parents could opt out simply by writing a short statement declaring that they opposed vaccines.\n\nWith this school year, parents now must meet first with a health care provider, who must attest that the parents have been provided with information about vaccines and vaccine-preventable illness. Right away, the rate of personal belief exemptions dropped by 19 percent statewide.\n\n\u201cThe educational requirement can be a significant step in getting people to choose to have their children vaccinated,\u201d Ross Silverman, a professor of public health law at Indiana University, told me. \u201cThe decision to have these exemptions at all is a purely political one.\u201d\n\nWhile public health agencies have the power to require vaccination, he said, \u201cyou want to strike the balance with protecting the public\u2019s health against being seen as too forceful.\u201d\n\nHe wrote recently in JAMA about different legislative tools to limit non-medical vaccine exemptions, including options that California has not pursued:\n\nRequiring annual renewal of the personal belief exemption. Right now, parents need only file at kindergarten and seventh grade\n\nRequire notarization to file the personal belief exemption form\n\nFor religious exemptions, require a religious leader within the organization to submit a letter on your behalf\n\nThe state with the best \u201cevidence-driven structure\u201d for a philosophical exemption, Silverman said, is Arkansas, which has all three policies above in place.\n\nArkansas\u2019 exemption rate in the 2013-2014 school year was 1.2 percent, versus California\u2019s 3.3 percent that year.\n\nMeanwhile, Oregon has only a religious exemption, and its rate in 2013-2014 was 7.1 percent. That\u2019s among the highest exemption rates in the country, Silverman says, \u201cand they don\u2019t even have a philosophical exemption.\u201d\n\nIn addition to strict rules about obtaining an exemption, the other opportunity to increase vaccination has to do with messaging around vaccines. Simply spreading straightforward public health information is not effective \u2014 and may even be counterproductive \u2014 for some people already hesitant about vaccines, Nyhan reported in a famous study last year.\n\nBut he recommends other approaches to improving vaccination rates. He cited a campaign in a community in Western Australia that focuses on values, not science, shared by community members. One photo shows a dad, \u201cAndrew,\u201d carrying a baby in a sling, with the message \u201cI use cloth nappies, I eat whole foods, and I immunise.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a powerful message, and it \u201ccommunicate(s) that you share the values and backgrounds of the people exempting,\u201d Nyhan said.\n\nNyhan also worries that the media focus on people who refuse vaccines may create a false impression that those views are mainstream. Even in California, measles outbreak and all, only 2.5 percent of kindergartners this year had a non-medical exemption. Put a different way, more than 97 percent of California parents vaccinate their kids.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Students leaving a vaccine clinic after being vaccinated against whooping cough at a middle school in Los Angeles.
