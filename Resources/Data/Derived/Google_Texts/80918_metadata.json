(Special to the Reporter-Herald)\n\nESTES PARK -- The Rocky Mountain Nature Association has announced a drive to get the Colorado legislature to create a Rocky Mountain National Park license plate.\n\nThe group will be taking signatures from Colorado residents on a petition for the special license plate through Dec. 20.\n\nThe proposed license plate design features a bull elk under a starry sky with alpine tundra flowers and reads, \"Rocky Mountain National Park.\"\n\nOrganizers hope it can be made by 2015 to coincide with Rocky Mountain National Park's centennial celebration.\n\nSignatures of 3,000 Colorado registered vehicle owners are needed to bring a bill to the Colorado legislature in January 2014.\n\nThose signatures also are a pledge to buy a plate if the bill is approved by the legislature. An additional $25 charge will apply and will be donated to the Rocky Mountain Nature Association, which will use the money generated to support education programs in the park.\n\nTo learn more or sign the petition, visit the Rocky Mountain Nature Association's website at rmna.org.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/larimer-county/ci_24544617/new-rocky-mountain-national-park-license-plate-proposed", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2013/1117/20131117_103215_RMNPplate_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Reporter-Herald Staff", "description": "ESTES PARK -- The Rocky Mountain Nature Association has announced a drive to get the Colorado legislature to create a Rocky Mountain National Park license plate.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:24544617:view"}, "startDate": "2013-11-17T22:32:31-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/larimer-county/ci_24544617/new-rocky-mountain-national-park-license-plate-proposed", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2013/1117/20131117_103215_RMNPplate.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "ESTES PARK -- The Rocky Mountain Nature Association has announced a drive to get the Colorado legislature to create a Rocky Mountain National Park license plate.", "title": "New Rocky Mountain National Park license plate proposed"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "ESTES PARK -- The Rocky Mountain Nature Association has announced a drive to get the Colorado legislature to create a Rocky Mountain National Park license plate.", "title": "New Rocky Mountain National Park license plate proposed", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/larimer-county/ci_24544617/new-rocky-mountain-national-park-license-plate-proposed", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2013/1117/20131117_103215_RMNPplate.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-17T22:32:31-0700", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "New Rocky Mountain National Park license plate proposed", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2013/1117/20131117_103215_RMNPplate.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Northern Colorado News", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "modificationDate": "2013-11-17T22:32:46-0700", "endDate": "2023-11-17T22:32:31-0700", "byline": "Reporter-Herald Staff", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "pubDate": "2013-11-17T22:34:24-0700", "news_keywords": "Loveland Reporter Herald news weather information larimer county"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfd38\"", "article_summary": "(Special to the Reporter-Herald)ESTES PARK -- The Rocky Mountain Nature Association has announced a drive to get the Colorado legislature to create a Rocky Mountain National Park license plate.\nThe proposed new Rocky Mountain National Park license plate would look like this.\nThe proposed license plate design features a bull elk under a starry sky with alpine tundra flowers and reads, \"Rocky Mountain National Park.\"\nOrganizers hope it can be made by 2015 to coincide with Rocky Mountain National Park's centennial celebration.\nTo learn more or sign the petition, visit the Rocky Mountain Nature Association's website at rmna.org."}
