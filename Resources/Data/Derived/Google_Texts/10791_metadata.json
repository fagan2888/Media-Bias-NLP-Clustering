Scott Walker after a generating favorable buzz with a reputation-making speech Saturday that drew rowdy cheers and multiple standing ovations, followed by a mobbed press conference and book-signing.\n\nShe finished in second place even though a good number of attendees knew little or nothing about her going into the sixth annual summit, compared with longtime conservative favorites such as Mr. Carson, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.\n\n\u201cFiorina comes in not very well-known, unless you\u2019re a political junkie family like ours that watches Fox all the time,\u201d said Centennial Institute director John Andrews. \u201cA lot of people had just vaguely heard the name Fiorina. In fact, somebody just now was praising her to me and couldn\u2019t pronounce her last name.\n\n\u201cSo she was starting from a low baseline when she stepped onto the stage Saturday morning, but she had a lot of upside to realize,\u201d Mr. Andrews said. \u201cAnd she has the speaking gifts and interview gifts to go ahead and cash in \u2014 which she did.\u201d\n\nMs. Fiorina won over the audience with her no-nonsense views on big government and national security, compassion for those hit hardest by Democratic programs like Obamacare, and an unflinching take on her own struggles, which include a battle with cancer and being fired from Hewlett-Packard.\n\nShe was able to play the \u201cwoman card\u201d \u2014 for instance, recounting how she was asked whether her \u201chormones\u201d would interfere with her serving as commander in chief \u2014 in a way that had men cheering as loudly as women.\n\n\u201cLadies, here\u2019s a little test: Can any of you think of a single instance in which a man\u2019s judgment might have been clouded by his hormones?\u201d she said to raucous applause and laughter. \u201cAny at all? Including in the Oval Office.\u201d\n\nNobody needed reminding that Ms. Fiorina is the only female Republican presidential candidate at a time when Hillary Rodham Clinton, the prohibitive favorite for the Democratic nomination, is casting her candidacy as a historic opportunity to put a woman in the White House.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton must not be president of these United States, but not because she\u2019s a woman,\u201d Ms. Fiorina said. \u201cHillary Clinton must not be president of these United States because she lacks a track record of leadership, because she is not transparent, and because her policies are bad for the people of this nation.\u201d\n\nMr. Carson, a former neurosurgeon, won the straw poll with 224 votes over 201 for Ms. Fiorina, followed by Mr. Walker with 192. All three would-be candidates spoke at the summit, which has proved to be a virtual prerequisite for winning the poll.\n\nIn fact, Ms. Fiorina may have won the poll outright if she had anything approaching Mr. Carson\u2019s grass-roots army and its experienced get-out-the-straw-poll-vote operation. His supporters took advantage of the cheaper $25 ticket for the Friday and Saturday night events to juice voter turnout.\n\nThe summit drew six would-be Republican presidential candidates. The others were former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. Also appearing was a campaign surrogate, Rafael Cruz, father of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.\n\nThe headliners were Mr. Carson and Mr. Walker, who received top billing and spoke Saturday night at the Colorado Convention Center\u2019s Bellco Theatre, while Ms. Fiorina appeared before a smaller crowd Saturday morning.\n\nA former neurosurgeon, Mr. Carson had plenty of comebacks to those who have dismissed him as a political novice because he has never run for public office. He noted that his campaign recently chalked up 200,000 donations, and \u201cno one else even comes close to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though the professional pundits say, \u2018You can\u2019t do it because you\u2019re not a politician,\u2019 I would say, \u2018I can do it because I\u2019m not a politician,\u2019\u201d Mr. Carson said to loud cheers. \u201cNor do I ever want to be one.\u201d\n\nMr. Walker touted Wisconsin\u2019s improving economic and education conditions achieved during his tenure, even though he had to beat back a union-spurred recall election shortly after he took office in 2011, becoming the only governor in history to do so.\n\nAsked how he would defeat Ms. Clinton, Mr. Walker cited three reasons: \u201cIf we\u2019re going to beat a name from the past, we\u2019re going to need a name from the future,\u201d in an apparent jab at former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose brother and father have served as president.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to beat somebody who embodies Washington \u2026 we need someone who is the anti-Washington,\u201d Mr. Walker said. He also said that unlike Mrs. Clinton, \u201cwe\u2019ve actually done something.\u201d\n\nMr. Walker also showed that he can handle a curve ball. After a heckler from the audience shouted at him about his position on immigration, Mr. Walker said, \u201cI\u2019m used to protesters, so this is not uncommon. Probably exported in from Wisconsin.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve had 100,000 protesters and death threats in front of your house, one or two guys shouting \u2014 what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d he said to applause.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ben Carson repeated Sunday as the winner of the Western Conservative Summit's Republican presidential straw poll, but Carly Fiorina stole the show.", "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Ben Carson repeated Sunday as the winner of the Western Conservative Summit\u2019s Republican presidential straw poll, but Carly Fiorina stole the show.", "title": "Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina top Western Conservative Summit\u2019s GOP presidential straw poll", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/28/ben-carson-carly-fiorina-top-western-conservative-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/07/6_7_2015_ap1258867566458201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/07/6_7_2015_ap1258867566458201.jpg", "title": "Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina top Western Conservative Summit\u2019s GOP", "description": "Ben Carson repeated Sunday as the winner of the Western Conservative Summit's Republican presidential straw poll, but Carly Fiorina stole the show.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Scott Walker, Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, John Andrews"}, "article_summary": "DENVER \u2014 Ben Carson repeated Sunday as the winner of the Western Conservative Summit\u2019s Republican presidential straw poll, but Carly Fiorina stole the show.\n\u201cHillary Clinton must not be president of these United States, but not because she\u2019s a woman,\u201d Ms. Fiorina said.\nAfter a heckler from the audience shouted at him about his position on immigration, Mr. Walker said, \u201cI\u2019m used to protesters, so this is not uncommon.\nA former neurosurgeon, Mr. Carson had plenty of comebacks to those who have dismissed him as a political novice because he has never run for public office.\nThe former Hewlett-Packard CEO placed second to Mr. Carson and ahead of Wisconsin Gov."}
