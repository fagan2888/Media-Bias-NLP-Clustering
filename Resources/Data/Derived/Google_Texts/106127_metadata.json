Lee facility from the banks of the Saluda River near Greenville and Anderson, South Carolina, to safer dry, lined storage away from the river.\n\nBased on the agreement Duke Energy has committed to moving 3.2 million tons of ash in pits along the Saluda River to dry, lined storage away from waterway, including the ash in two leaking lagoons and in an ash storage area near the lagoons.\n\nThe W.S. Lee Steam Station, which was retired in November, was Duke Energy\u2019s last remaining coal-fired plant in South Carolina.\n\nIn North Carolina, Duke is required (under the Coal Ash Management Act) to clean-up just four of the 14 coal ash storage sites in the state. The state\u2019s Coal Ash Management Commission will assess the other ten sites and set timetables for their clean-up.\n\nThe Coal Ash Management Commission is scheduled to meet again on January 14th in Raleigh.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2199\"", "article_summary": "In North Carolina, Duke is required (under the Coal Ash Management Act) to clean-up just four of the 14 coal ash storage sites in the state.\nThe Coal Ash Management Commission is scheduled to meet again on January 14th in Raleigh.\nThe state\u2019s Coal Ash Management Commission will assess the other ten sites and set timetables for their clean-up.\nLee Steam Station, which was retired in November, was Duke Energy\u2019s last remaining coal-fired plant in South Carolina.\nLee facility from the banks of the Saluda River near Greenville and Anderson, South Carolina, to safer dry, lined storage away from the river."}
