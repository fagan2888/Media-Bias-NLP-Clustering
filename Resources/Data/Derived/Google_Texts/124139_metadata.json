Hours after he rang the bell to start trading Alibaba stock on the New York stock exchange, the company was valued at $231bn and Ma himself was worth more than $19bn.\n\nMa didn\u2019t grow up privileged. What\u2019s the secret to his success? It\u2019s the one you hear from so many CEOs: hard work and dedication, according to his speech at the Clinton Global Initiative.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a rich father or a powerful uncle. We only have the customers that support us,\u201d Ma told Chelsea Clinton earlier this week, noting that Alibaba is a proof that \u201c80% of the people in China can be successful\u201d.\n\nMa is not the only one to believe that the way out of poverty is through hard work. The self-made success, who pulled himself up by his own bootstraps, is at the heart of the American dream.\n\n\u201cLiberals talk about circumstances; conservatives talk about character,\u201d writes Paul Krugman in a recent column, adding that for conservatives and the rich, \u201cit\u2019s all about not trying hard enough\u201d.\n\nQuestioning the narrative of the bulletproof work ethic is a bit like questioning mom and apple pie.\n\n\n\nBut it is true? Is a will to succeed and work ethic the primary ingredient that separates those who rise economically and those who don\u2019t?\n\n\n\nThere are reasons to be skeptical. Hard work will only get you so far if circumstances aren\u2019t amenable. The US economy is sputtering, barely motoring along. Unemployment is high, and job opportunities are rare. In a recent HuffingtonPost/ YouGov survey, 44% of them said that they believe that low-income Americans are poor due to lack of opportunities. About 47% said that poverty has to do with the fact that good jobs are not available. Just 28% said it\u2019s because poor Americans lack a work ethic.\n\nA recent hoax highlighted the resentment many feel against the perceived condescension of rich CEOs when jobs are unavailable and student debt is high.\n\n\n\nMa\u2019s speech at the Clinton Global Initiative took place around the same time that a fake op-ed, allegedly written by Ma, began circulating on the internet.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re still poor at 35, you deserve it,\u201d the piece declared.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can confirm that the article was not written by Jack,\u201d an Alibaba spokesperson told the Guardian.\n\nThere are, however, a few millionaires who agree that most people should just be working harder and whining less. Herewith, a few instant classics.\n\n\n\n\u2018Woe is me. Woe is us. Woe is this\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bud Konheim to 99%: Enough with the \u2018woe is me\u2019 narrative. Photograph: KeystoneUSA-Zuma/ Rex Features\n\nThat is what Bud Konheim, co-founder and CEO of fashion company Nicole Miller, said in February when he appeared on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a country [where] the poverty level is wealth in 99% of the rest of the world. So we are talking about \u2018Woe is me. Woe is us. Woe is this,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo here we are, incredibly wealthy. Nobody has to suffer. There it is, money is all over the place and the guy that\u2019s making \u2013 \u2018Oh my God, he\u2019s making $35,000 a year.\u2019 Why don\u2019t you try that out in India or some countries we can\u2019t even name? China, anyplace, the guy is wealthy.\u201d\n\nWhile Konheim might be right and globally $34,000 a year would put you into the top 1%, in the US that\u2019s barely enough to get by because it\u2019s more expensive in raw dollars to buy food and consumer products in the US.\n\n\n\n\u2018I succeed because I am driven and I take the risks. Deal with it\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sam Zell walks on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, June 12, 2007, following a meeting with the Senate Democratic leadership. Photograph: Lawrence Jackson/AP\n\nClearly, poor people just need to be motivated. However, instead of providing them with opportunities, the government with the help of things like tax credits and unemployment insurance has contributed to the state of \u201clearned helplessness\u201d among America\u2019s poor, Sam Zell, founder of Equity Group Investments. said when he appeared on CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box in 2012.\n\nThe reality is as follows: the whole focus has been on how the 1%-ers, the 10%-ers \u2013 whatever these top earners [are] \u2013 have moved ahead of everybody. I wonder if there\u2019s any correlation between while they were moving ahead, the rest of the government was subsidizing more and more people and disincentivizing them. Why is it always assumed that somebody doesn\u2019t succeed because he can\u2019t, as opposed to he doesn\u2019t want to, or isn\u2019t incentivized to.\n\n\u201cI think that they are disincentivized by, in effect, if you don\u2019t have to pay for your health care, that\u2019s another thing you don\u2019t have to worry about,\u201d he added. \u201cFor every step contributing to the progress at the top, there\u2019s an additional step on the bottom to increase the earned income [tax credit], to extend unemployment insurance for 28 years.\u201d\n\nHis final words to host Andrew Ross Sorkin: \u201cThe world is not a zero-sum game. If I succeed, it doesn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t. I succeed because I am driven and I take the risks. Deal with it.\u201d\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the last time that Zell made such statements, either.\n\n\u2018The 1% work harder. The 1% are much bigger factors in society\u2019\n\nTom Perkins, who has said that the wealthy should get more votes in elections. Photograph: Eric Risberg/Associated Press\n\nEarlier this year, after Tom Perkins compared the war on the rich to holocaust, Zell jumped to Perkins\u2019 defense.\n\nIn a letter to the Wall Street Journal, Perkins wrote:\n\nI would call attention to the parallels of fascist Nazi Germany to its war on its \u201cone percent,\u201d namely its Jews, to the progressive war on the American 1%, namely the \u201crich.\u201d\n\n\u201cI perceive a rising tide of hatred of the successful 1%,\u201d he added.\n\nFew weeks later, Zell told Bloomberg TV that he agreed with Perkins.\n\n\u201cI guess my feeling is that he\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 1% are being pummeled because it\u2019s politically convenient to do so.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that the world and this country should not talk about envy of the 1%. It should talk about emulating the 1%. The 1% work harder. The 1% are much bigger factors in all forms of our society.\n\nZell is not the only one to think that everyone envies the rich.\n\n\u2018Spend less time drinking or smoking and socialising\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gina Rinehart was the first woman to top Forbes Asia\u2019s list of Australia\u2019s richest people. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThat\u2019s according to Australian billionaire Gina Rinehart. Her advice? Stop socializing and get to work.\n\n\u201cThere is no monopoly on becoming a millionaire,\u201d she wrote in a 2012 column for Australian Resources and Investment magazine.\n\nIf you\u2019re jealous of those with more money, don\u2019t just sit there and complain. Do something to make more money yourself \u2014 spend less time drinking or smoking and socialising, and more time working. Become one of those people who work hard, invest and build, and at the same time create employment and opportunities for others.\n\nWe\u2019re opening the comments section to debate. What do you think is the secret ingredient to climbing out of poverty? Hard work? Luck? Or a little bit of both?", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Jana Kasperkevic: Want to be as successful as Jack Ma, the richest man in China?
