The Cochise County Sheriffâ€™s Office has announced the arrests of four suspects linked to a September 2014 homicide.

A Hereford woman had called 911 after finding her son, Andrew Gasson, dead inside his home. An autopsy found Gasson had been shot in the head. Investigators say there were indications the incident was drug related.

The sheriff's department says Martin Wetstein, Kelly Tarrant, and Christopher Cruz have all been charged with first-degree murder. Investigators say Greg Tarrant, the father of Kelly Tarrant, is charged with destroying and disposing of the gun used in the crime.

In a release, the Cochise County Sheriff's Office says investigators conducted hundreds of interviews in Arizona and in Idaho.
