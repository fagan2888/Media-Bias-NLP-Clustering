However, there are a lot of questions about what these wells are and what they do.\n\nThe Oklahoma Corporation Commission works closely with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Safe Drinking Water Act to make sure disposal wells are safe, but that practice is now in serious question.\n\nInjection wells are used for a lot of things, but right now the focus is on disposal wells. They are a type of injection well and at the center of a lot of attention.\n\n\u201cA disposal well is a well that is used to take oil and gas wastewater and put it into an underground formation that has been deemed safe by federal and state authorities for the storing of that water,\u201d Oklahoma Corporation Commission spokesman Matt Skinner said.\n\nThere are about 4,000 disposal wells in Oklahoma, and about 1,000 of them are known as Arbuckle wells.\n\n\u201cOf those the ones that researchers say we really need to concentrate on when it comes to earthquakes are Arbuckle disposal wells,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cThey dispose into the state\u2019s deepest formation, which is called the Arbuckle.\u201d\n\nThe largest part of wastewater comes from producing wells, but with that comes water from the formation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very high in chloride, many times saltier than the ocean,\u201d Skinner said.\n\nAccording to hydrogeologists, water is injected through tubing and casing several thousand feet into the Oklahoma ground - more than a billion barrels a year. That amount is equivalent to all the water in Lake Thunderbird, two Lake Hefners or five Arcadia Lakes.\n\n\u201cWhile this technique has long been regarded as the Cadillac when it comes to protecting our fresh water, with the onset of earthquakes and the models that show the relationship between deep high water wastewater injection and earthquakes, you have to change what you mean by \u2018safe,\u2019\u201d Skinner said.\n\nThe Corporation Commission says two companies have challenged their well guidelines - Tulsa based company Marjo and SandRidge Energy.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "With all the earthquakes Oklahoma is experiencing, there has been a lot of talk about disposal wells and the correlation between the two.
