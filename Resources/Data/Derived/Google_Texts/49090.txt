Sunday will be sunny with a high temperature close to 50 degrees, but 2 to 4 inches of snow is expected to hit the metro area by Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service.

“We rebound after that for Wednesday and the weekend,” said Kyle Frieden, NWS meteorologist. “It is possible it will be like last weekend, hopefully with less wind.”

Unseasonably warm temperatures broke weather records across Colorado on Thursday, with the mercury hitting 73 degrees. But winds were powerful and gusty throughout the state.

Temperatures this February have averaged 4.9 degrees above the 36.6 degree average for the month. But February is unlikely to top the record average for the month, 43.7 degrees, set in 1954, Frieden said.

Rain turning to snow is expected to begin Monday evening and continue into Tuesday.
