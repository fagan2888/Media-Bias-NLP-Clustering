Beck just couldn\u2019t resist jumping on Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s comments at the University of Hawaii that it is entirely possible that in another time of war the Supreme Court might allow the U.S. government to set up internment camps, like those used for Japanese immigrants during World War II. On his internet radio show on The Blaze, Beck took Scalia\u2019s comments completely out of context to suggest that, because President Obama did not act like Jesus when he was first elected and unite the country\u2014the \u201cbiggest missed opportunity in all of world history\u2014those who disagree with him on issues such as global warming, Obamacare, or abortion rights are bound to be thrown into internment camps.\n\n\n\nBeck\u2019s internment camp caution was not his first infraction against his own promise to be less divisive in the last two weeks. In fact, he\u2019s pretty much carried on with fear mongering as usual since that apparently insignificant interview with Megyn Kelly. At a Texas GOP event earlier this week, Beck chided the Republican party for not taking harsher action and appointing a special prosecutor to investigate the Benghazi scandal, the IRS, and just President Obama himself because \u201che looked at the American people and lied,\u201d about Obamacare. In the same speech, Beck compared Washington, D.C. to Chernobyl\u2014because our political system is \u201ctoxic,\u201d get it?\u2014and suggested Congress solve its problems the same way the Ukraine handled the catastrophic nuclear disaster back in 1986. \u201cYou, you go in. You open the door. Then you get out...You make sure the document is still there. Then you get out,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it should be. We are dealing with Chernobyl. It\u2019s a meltdown of our system.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe week prior (also the week after his apology) was a busy one for Beck. First, he defended venture capitalist Tom Perkins against criticism for his argument, published in a Wall Street Journal letter to the editor, that the \u201cprogressive war on the American one percent\u201d is the modern-day equivalent of the Nazis\u2019 condemnation of Jews during the Holocaust. Beck argued that Perkins\u2019 subsequent apology in the face of major scrutiny was proof that \u201cWe are Germany 1930. You can deny it all you want,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the socialist revolution is here.\u201d\n\nAfter declaring the start of the socialist revolution, Beck tackled some lighter news: the Grammys. Shockingly, it was not the mass gay-and-straight wedding that sent some of his peers into a tailspin that bothered Beck. It was Katy Perry\u2019s performance of her song \u201cDark Horse,\u201d that really upset him. Beck called Perry\u2019s presentation \u201cfull-fledged witchcraft and demonic glorification.\u201d\n\nThen of course, there was the State of the Union address, about which we would have been fools to think Beck wouldn\u2019t have had something to say. And true to form, Beck held nothing back, deeming Obama\u2019s annual speech \u201cthe State of the Union where our president declared he would become America\u2019s first dictator.\u201d To be sure, Obama\u2019s \u201ccontinual pronouncements that he fully intends to trash the constitution of the United States,\u201d were only the worst parts of the address. \u201cThe speech was horrific from start to finish.\u201d\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEInCVdTQIk&feature=youtu.be", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "CEDickson"}, "keywords": "Glenn Beck, U.S. Politics", "publicationDate": 201402061920, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/features/fringe-factor", "description": "Two weeks after apologizing for tearing the nation apart, Glenn Beck is calling Obama a dictator and claiming abortion opponents will be sent to internment camps.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "He's Back!
