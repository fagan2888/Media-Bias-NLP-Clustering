(Photo: Monkey Business Images / TNS)\n\nWhether you\u2019re a woman or a man who wants to turn back the clock on aging, plastic surgery and non-surgical procedures such as injections and fat grafts are becoming a top anti-retirement expense.\n\nMargaret Cipparrone, for one, is not ready to retire. She works as a county assistant prosecutor and spends a lot of time in front of juries.\n\n\u201cWhen I have the \u201811s\u2019 in between my eyebrows, I look too stern,\u201d she says, referring to her least favorite worry lines on her face.\n\n\u201cJuries don\u2019t like that, they want women to look pleasant. If I\u2019m stern or assertive but I look pleasant, they accept what I\u2019m saying,\u201d says Cipparrone, 63, who recognizes that \u201cjuries talk about me, what I\u2019m wearing and how I appear. I have to look the part.\u201d\n\nTo postpone retirement, she went to physician Karen Harkaway for some work. Cipparrone isn\u2019t yet having true plastic surgery \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m still paying for my kids\u2019 college and graduate school educations,\u201d she says \u2014 but Harkaway gave her Juvederm non-surgical injections.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had Botox, as well, but it didn\u2019t last,\u201d Cipparrone says. \u201cAnd I realize I can\u2019t go back in time. But it helped me keep and obtain a job.\u201d She graduated law school at 40 and is one of a team that tries cases.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m financially stable, and I\u2019m going to keep working,\u201d she says. \u201cI like my job, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s time for me to retire. I want my kids\u2019 school loans paid off and to remain in the workforce. You have to fit in.\u201d\n\nBaby boomers are \u201chaving a lot of work done to stay competitive in the workplace,\u201d says Leigh Hope Fountain, spokeswoman for the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. \u201cIt\u2019s very ageist, but it\u2019s the unfortunate reality.\u201d\n\nPrivate lenders are stepping in to finance nips and tucks. Graham Anderson, director of health care marketing at San Francisco-based Prosper Healthcare Lending, says the firm sets up relationships with plastic surgery centers.\n\nThe lender\u2019s data show people in their 80s asking for loans for plastic surgery, including face-lifts, eyelid lifts and tummy tucks.\n\n\u201cHealth care lending has been around 30 years, as costs have grown dramatically. A lot of that is due to deductibles rising under Obamacare and general health costs going up,\u201d Anderson says.\n\n\u201cPeople are spending more out of pocket for primary care than ever before. Because of that, lending is naturally moving into elective space,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have less medical income lying around to spend, and so they finance the procedure through a loan.\u201d\n\nProsper\u2019s rates range from 5.99 percent to 36 percent depending on credit scores, with a term of 36-60 months, Anderson says.\n\nAbout a third of loans it has funded year to date were in plastic surgery, and the dollar amount per plastic-surgery loan in 2015 averages $8,157.\n\nBarry Noone has performed 1,800 face-lifts over a 40-year career, and the plastic surgeon says his practice among men is growing. The patient ratio used to be 20 women for every man, he says. Today, it\u2019s 15 women for every man.\n\nBoomer men \u201ccome in for eyelid and neck lifts quite a bit,\u201d Noone says. (He\u2019s had the eyelid surgery himself.)\n\nFor women, \u201cthey want to get rid of what\u2019s known as \u2018resting b---- face\u2019 \u2014 which is you look angry as the corners of your mouth start to droop.\u201d\n\nPhysician Mark Solomon also says his male patients have to compete against a much younger population.\n\nOne successful businessman \u201cis the face of the company, literally\u201d and attributes his success to his appearance. \u201cHe\u2019s 70 and shows no sign of slowing down, but he looks like he\u2019s in his late 50s. He\u2019s got a lot of bang for his buck.\u201d\n\nOver 20 years, the patient has spent $30,000, Solomon says.\n\nAnother patient \u201chad this feeling they were trying to find someone younger,\u201d Solomon says. \u201cWe did hair restoration on him,\u201d at a cost of $10,000, \u201cbut it allowed him to keep his six-figure job.\u201d\n\nBrannon Claytor, Noone\u2019s partner at the practice, says another patient, a lawyer, was telling all her clients she took an extended vacation when in fact she got a face-lift.\n\n\u201cIt bought her another 10 years in the workforce. She was 64,\u201d Claytor says.\n\nCipparrone acknowledges that she can\u2019t translate her facial injections into hard financial returns.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you that because of this I make more money,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I feel more successful in my job. I get a better verdict and a better result with juries and jurors. It\u2019s tangible. I\u2019ll stay in my position until it\u2019s time to retire from the county prosecutor\u2019s office. I can then go into private practice.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1FtTw4L", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Older women and men spend thousands of dollars on face-lifts, tummy tucks and hair restorations", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "Older women and men spend thousands of dollars on face-lifts, tummy tucks and hair restorations", "title": "Baby boomers stave off retirement with plastic surgery", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/personal-finance/2015/09/27/baby-boomers-stave-retirement-plastic-surgery/72942440/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Older women and men spend thousands of dollars on face-lifts, tummy tucks and hair restorations", "title": "Baby boomers stave off retirement with plastic surgery", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4e06aaba79b63bec3711fedb22a4879f9b3998a2/c=500-0-2500-2000&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/27/DetroitNews/B99307812Z.1_20150927181701_000_GKUJHL6F.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf389\"", "article_summary": "The lender\u2019s data show people in their 80s asking for loans for plastic surgery, including face-lifts, eyelid lifts and tummy tucks.\nGraham Anderson, director of health care marketing at San Francisco-based Prosper Healthcare Lending, says the firm sets up relationships with plastic surgery centers.\nPlastic surgery and non-surgical procedures like injections are becoming a top anti-retirement expense.\nAbout a third of loans it has funded year to date were in plastic surgery, and the dollar amount per plastic-surgery loan in 2015 averages $8,157.\nCipparrone isn\u2019t yet having true plastic surgery \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m still paying for my kids\u2019 college and graduate school educations,\u201d she says \u2014 but Harkaway gave her Juvederm non-surgical injections."}
