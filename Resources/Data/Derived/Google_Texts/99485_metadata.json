The large field of 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls quickly ripped the decision, reiterating vows to repeal and replace the law if elected to the White House.\n\nHere\u2019s what they had to say:\n\nJeb Bush: \u201cAs president of the United States, I would make fixing our broken health-care system one of my top priorities. I will work with Congress to repeal and replace this flawed law with conservative reforms that empower consumers with more choices and control over their health care decisions,\u201d former Florida Gov. Bush said in a statement.\n\nBen Carson: The retired neurosurgeon said the decision represented a \u201cfundamental increase of government control.\u201d\n\nWe must #Repeal and replace #Obamacare with sensible consumer empowering solutions that remove govt from the patient/doctor relationship. \u2014 Dr. Ben Carson (@RealBenCarson) June 25, 2015\n\nTed Cruz: The Texas senator says he\u2019s committed to repealing \u201cevery single word\u201d of Obamacare.\n\nI remain fully committed to a #FullRepeal of Obamacare. And in 2017 we will do exactly that: https://t.co/d95aQNAiI5 pic.twitter.com/QVjEE7Wkxi \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) June 25, 2015\n\nCarly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard also called for repeal.\n\nRepeal Obamacare and let the free market\u2014not more crony capitalism\u2014improve access and care for all Americans. http://t.co/qaAR7pNVQJ \u2014 Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) June 25, 2015\n\nLindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator, said: \u201cToday\u2019s decision only reinforces why we need a president who will bring about real reform that repeals Obamacare and replaces it with a plan that expands consumer choice, increases coverage, delivers better value for the dollar, and gives states more control, without stifling job creation. As president, this is the kind of reform I would put in place.\u201d\n\nMike Huckabee: The decision \u201cis an out-of-control act of judicial tyranny\u2026As president, I will protect Medicare, repeal Obamacare, and pass real reform that will actually lower costs, while focusing on cures and prevention rather than intervention,\u201d said the former Arkansas governor.\n\nBobby Jindal: The Louisiana governor said President Obama \u201cwould like this to be the end of the debate on Obamacare, but it isn\u2019t. The debate will continue because the law has failed to accomplish its prime objective: Containing health-care costs.\u201d He said conservatives must be fearless and demand \u201cthat our leaders in Washington repeal and replace Obamacare with a plan that will lower health-care costs and restore freedom.\u201d\n\nRand Paul: The Kentucky senator said the decision turns the rule of law and common sense \u201con its head.\u201d\n\nAs President I would make it my mission to repeal #Obamacare, and propose real solutions for our healthcare system. http://t.co/9KHFqbBWwS \u2014 Dr. Rand Paul (@RandPaul) June 25, 2015\n\nRick Perry: The former Texas governor called for throwing out and replacing the law, and said in a statement: \u201cWe need leadership in the White House that recognizes the folly of having to pass a bill to know what\u2019s in it. We need leadership that understands a heavy-handed, one-size-fits-all policy does nothing to help health outcomes for Americans.\u201d\n\nMarco Rubio, the Florida senator, also says he\u2019s committed to tossing the law and replacing it.\n\nI remain committed to repealing this bad law and replacing it... \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 25, 2015\n\n...with my consumer-centered plan that puts patients and families back in control of their health care decisions. \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) June 25, 2015\n\nRick Santorum: The former Pennsylvania senator said the ruling is a reminder the U.S. must elect \u201ca conservative president.\u201d\n\nToday's Supreme Court ruling is another reminder that if we want to get rid of #Obamacare, we must elect a conservative President #RICK2016 \u2014 Rick Santorum (@RickSantorum) June 25, 2015\n\nScott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, hasn\u2019t yet declared he\u2019s running but is expected to. He\u2019s in the repeal and replace camp as well.\n\nToday's #SCOTUScare ruling means Republicans must redouble their efforts to repeal and replace this destructive & costly law. -SKW \u2014 Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) June 25, 2015\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "What the Republican presidential hopefuls are saying about the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold subsidies available under Obamacare.", "creator": "@mktwrobs", "image": {"width": 1320, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DB652_bush_j_ZG_20141216104907.jpg", "height": 742}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Robert Schroeder", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Economy & Politics", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "What the Republican presidential hopefuls are saying about the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold subsidies available under Obamacare.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-jeb-bush-and-other-republican-presidential-hopefuls-are-saying-about-the-obamacare-decision-2015-06-25", "author": "Robert Schroeder", "parsely-title": "Here\u2019s what Jeb Bush and other Republican presidential hopefuls are saying about the Obamacare decision", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-06-25T15:14:00-04:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Economy & Politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "What the Republican presidential hopefuls are saying about the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold subsidies available under Obamacare.", "title": "Here\u2019s what Jeb Bush and other Republican presidential hopefuls are saying about the Obamacare decision", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-jeb-bush-and-other-republican-presidential-hopefuls-are-saying-about-the-obamacare-decision-2015-06-25", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DB652_bush_j_ZG_20141216104907.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DB652_bush_j_ZG_20141216104907.jpg"}, "article.id": "A3234D5A-1B4E-11E5-BE55-528AE33840D8", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd160c\"", "article_summary": "Repeal Obamacare and let the free market\u2014not more crony capitalism\u2014improve access and care for all Americans.\nThe large field of 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls quickly ripped the decision, reiterating vows to repeal and replace the law if elected to the White House.\nIn a victory for President Barack Obama, the high court voted to uphold subsidies available under his namesake health-care law.\n\u2014 Dr. Ben Carson (@RealBenCarson) June 25, 2015Ted Cruz: The Texas senator says he\u2019s committed to repealing \u201cevery single word\u201d of Obamacare.\nThe Supreme Court has spoken, but Republicans with their eyes on the White House want the last word on Obamacare."}
