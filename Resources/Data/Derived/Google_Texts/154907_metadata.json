Ted Cruz and former neurosurgeon Ben Carson in the latest CPAC straw poll.\n\nMr. Paul would be the second formally declared candidate, since Mr. Cruz plans to announce his bid Monday. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Mr. Carson have announced exploratory committees, but have not formally declared their candidacy.\n\nMr. Paul has the support of much of the libertarian-mined conservatives who were devoted followers of his father, Ron Paul, also a physician and former U.S. House member from Texas who won a strong following for his allegiance to conservative, free-market principles of individual freedom throughout his career in Congress and in two races for the GOP president nomination.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rand Paul will formally declare his candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination with a five-state, five-day announcement tour next month, Republicans knowledgeable about the Kentucky senator\u2019s plans told The Washington Times.", "Author": "Ralph Z.
