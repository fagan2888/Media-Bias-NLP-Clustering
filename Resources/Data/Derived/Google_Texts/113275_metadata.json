Specifically, the researchers examined the health of nearly a half-million adolescents in 34 countries between 2002 and 2010.\n\nElgar and his colleagues found that even though the health of children improved overall, it has also become increasing unequal based on income. These inequalities were illustrated in factors ranging from body mass to physical activity to mental health, all of which fluctuated widely between affluent and disadvantaged youths.\n\n\u201cHealth inequalities in youths shape future inequities in education, employment, adult health, and life expectancy, and should be a focus of health policy,\u201d said Elgar, who is also an associate professor in the Faculty of Medicine\u2019s Department of Psychiatry and researcher at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "A new report finds that as income inequality grows in Europe and North America, so does the health gap between children from affluent and disadvantaged households", "author": "Laura Kiesel", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "A new report finds that as income inequality grows in Europe and North America, so does the health gap between children from affluent and disadvantaged households", "title": "Increase in Income Inequality Related to Greater Disparities in Adolescent Health", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/increase-in-income-inequality-related-to-greater-disparities-in-adolescent-health", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/lk-wealthgap-ms.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/lk-wealthgap-ms.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Financial Planning", "keywords": "healthcare, adolescents, health insurance, income inequality, social programs, Affordable Care Act", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Financial Planning", "tag": "Affordable Care Act", "published_time": "2015-03-24T11:34Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1320112"}, "date": "2015-03-24T11:34Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13088216, "twitter": {"description": "A new report finds that as income inequality grows in Europe and North America, so does the health gap between children from affluent and disadvantaged households", "title": "Increase in Income Inequality Related to Greater Disparities in Adolescent Health", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/increase-in-income-inequality-related-to-greater-disparities-in-adolescent-health", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/lk-wealthgap-ms.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/lk-wealthgap-ms.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "healthcare, adolescents, health insurance, income inequality, social programs, Affordable Care Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2f42\"", "article_summary": "The research--which was supported by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the Canada Research Chairs Programme--relied on data from the World Health Organization\u2019s Health Behaviour in School-aged Children.\nADVERTISEMENTNEW YORK (MainStreet) \u2014 The recent increases in income inequality in the United States and elsewhere can have many wide-ranging impacts--including on children\u2019s health.\nNamely, a new report published in the Lancet earlier this month, finds that health inequalities have increased in adolescents in many developed nations in tandem with rising socioeconomic disparities.\n\u201cHealth inequalities in youths shape future inequities in education, employment, adult health, and life expectancy, and should be a focus of health policy,\u201d said Elgar, who is also an associate professor in the Faculty of Medicine\u2019s Department of Psychiatry and researcher at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute.\nThese inequalities were illustrated in factors ranging from body mass to physical activity to mental health, all of which fluctuated widely between affluent and disadvantaged youths."}
