This tempest will pass \u2014 a new speaker will emerge \u2014 but the GOP faces bigger challenges that impair its ability to govern.\n\nThe party\u2019s commanding majority in the House owes much to the success of the Tea Party in recent elections. Now organized into the Freedom Caucus, disaffected conservatives are frustrated by their inability to repeal ObamaCare, stop the nuclear deal with Iran and defund Planned Parenthood.\n\nThe Constitution provided the majority in Congress with a trump card: primary authority for taxing and spending, a lever colonial legislatures used to discipline imperious royal governors. These days, however, if the Congress seeks to pressure a president by not passing a budget, the Supreme Court has permitted the chief executive to declare so many government activities essential that a government shutdown becomes his opportunity to merely impose threats \u2014 no Social Security checks \u2014 and inconveniences \u2014 close roads and public spaces \u2014 and then blame his opponents for creating chaos.\n\nArrogating power has become a modern Supreme Court specialty. For example, the issue of gay marriage, whatever its merits, should have been left to Congress and state legislatures to decide. Similarly, if the Constitution provides for Congress to decide what gets spent, then it \u2014 not the high court or the president \u2014 should determine what is essential in a shutdown.\n\nRepublicans need a speaker who can change the terms of the debate \u2014 call out the Supreme Court and president on the extra-constitutional conduct \u2014 and impose discipline on party members. Oddly enough, former Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi is the prototype.\n\nAlong with President Obama\u2019s penchant for unilateral action when he can\u2019t get what he wants from it \u2014 for example, the regulation of CO2 emissions or immigration legislation \u2014 Congress is reduced to a debating society on many issues.\n\nNo speaker can be effective if party members will not accept the outcome of caucus votes. The disloyalty of Freedom Caucus members on the House floor \u2014 for example, a dozen voting against Boehner in the 2013 chamber election for speaker \u2014 severely handicaps their leader in negotiations with the president and Senate leaders.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nNow Republicans are urging Paul Ryan to run for speaker. He is acceptable to moderates and has strong personal relationships with hard right conservatives, but he has demonstrated to be more a technician and skilled negotiator than the kind of charismatic and firm leader Congress so much needs at this moment.\n\nRepublicans need a speaker who can change the terms of the debate \u2014 call out the Supreme Court and president on the extra-constitutional conduct \u2014 and impose discipline on party members. Oddly enough, former Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi is the prototype.\n\nEven more troublesome for Republicans, they do not have a credible economic program. Fanciful ideas like the flat tax, privatizing Social Security and vouchers for health care don\u2019t resonate with voters.\n\nGovernment economists say inflation is near zero, yet health insurance premiums, cable TV, phone bills and college tuition keep rising \u2014 often at an alarming pace.\n\nBanks pay hardly any interest on savings but still charge double-digit rates on credit card debt.\n\nThese are big items, and all increasingly in the grasp of monopolies: consolidating health insurance companies and cable companies, big banks and government-supported universities that revel in big-time sports and shake down students.\n\nHillary Clinton has a new list of give-free stuff \u2014 free doctor\u2019s visits, free tuition and the like \u2014 that merely puts money in taxpayers\u2019 left pocket by snatching it from their right pocket. But these are attractive to voters because congressional Republicans keep tilting at windmills \u2014 pushing bills to repeal ObamaCare that the president can veto \u2014 and their presidential candidates \u2014 including establishment figures like Jeb Bush and outsiders like Donald Trump \u2014 hardly talk about these issues.\n\nModern Republicans should take a cue from Republican President Teddy Roosevelt, who was a trust buster and populist, and go after exploitive big businesses and state-anointed aristocrats at the football franchises that masquerade as universities.\n\nPeter Morici served as Chief Economist at the U.S. International Trade Commission from 1993 to 1995.
