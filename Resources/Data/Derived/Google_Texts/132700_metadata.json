Last week, their firm became the most prominent Wall Street institution since Drexel to cop a felony plea with federal prosecutors. As part of the agreement, SAC will be allowed to manage only the $9 billion in assets of its founder, Steven A. Cohen, and his own staff. As a result, many employees are presumably polishing their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and hoping the stain of last week's plea doesn't affect them.\n\n\n\nThe good news is that for most SAC employees, it probably won't. The towers of Wall Street are chockablock with people who have gotten second chances after working for convicted outfits. They are filled not only with Drexel alumni, but also even a few who once labored for giga-fraudster Bernie Madoff. Given that precedent, it looks as though SAC refugees will likely find many firms eager to bring them aboard, recruiters say.\n\n\n\n\"Only a handful have been found to have done anything illegal at the firm,\" said Richard Lipstein, a managing director at recruiter Gilbert Tweed International. \"There are a lot of talented professionals at SAC who would be very much in demand.\"\n\n\n\nMr. Andersen knows all about that. A pioneer in putting together junk-bond offerings, he quickly found work in a senior capacity at PaineWebber after Drexel collapsed. He later launched his own firm, G.C. Andersen Partners, whose client list includes First Data and Denny's.\n\n'Cool' factor\n\nHe doesn't remember what happened to his tearful colleague, but many of his former Drexel colleagues have done well indeed. Among them are private-equity titan Leon Black, Jefferies Group CEO Richard Handler, corporate dealmaker Ken Moelis and Milwaukee Brewers owner Mark Attanasio.\n\n\n\nEven Michael Milken, the Drexel junk-bond kingpin who pleaded guilty to fraud, served time in prison and is officially barred from the securities business, runs a think tank whose annual conference last year drew such speakers as Rupert Murdoch, Sumner Redstone and Sen. Harry Reid.\n\n\n\nIronically, Drexel today is remembered as least as much for all the Wall Street stars it spawned as it is for all the felonious acts it committed, which ultimately sank the firm into bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n\"It became cool to have worked at Drexel because so many people who worked there became so successful,\" Mr. Andersen said.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the most hopeful sign for SAC employees is that even alumni of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities have landed jobs in finance.\n\n\n\nThe firm had about 170 current or former employees in early 2009, shortly after Mr. Madoff confessed to his massive, long-running swindle, according to a document filed in federal bankruptcy court. Among the first 50 names, 12 have found jobs on Wall Street, according to records filed with securities-industry regulators and those employees' own LinkedIn pages.\n\n\n\nThey include the firm's former director of sales and marketing, who is currently plying his trade at Credit Suisse, and a former equity-trading supervisor who joined Nasdaq last summer as a director of trading services.\n\n\n\nEven those Madoff alumni who were never accused of any wrongdoing are eager to put the experience behind them. The former trader hired at Nasdaq, for instance, does not mention his lengthy tenure at Madoff on his LinkedIn page. His employment history between 1986 and 2009 is left blank. It can only be filled in by checking records filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.\n\nPressing reason\n\nSome SAC alumni have a far more pressing reason to leave their years with the firm a blank in people's minds. Among those is Michael Steinberg, a former SAC portfolio manager about to go on trial for insider trades that he allegedly made at SAC. Last week, his lawyers asked that potential jurors in his trial not be informed that Mr. Steinberg once worked at the disgraced hedge-fund firm.\n\n\n\nNo matter how the judge rules on that request, Mr. Steinberg's trial and that of another former SAC employee could cast a cloud over the near-term employment prospects of many SAC staffers. That is likely true even though many Successful firms might well be interested in hiring them.\n\n\n\nThat is partly a function of the broader taint of the firm's criminal conduct, and it partly relates to fears that others yet unnamed could be exposed during the trials.\n\nGet Crain's Daily Alert Sign up for our FREE daily email newsletter.
