My eyes kept drifting from the alternative minimum tax to the screen \u2014 which felt right, because I like the Los Angeles Lakers about as much as I like the IRS.\n\nThe fact that I could toil on a return in such laid-back circumstances shows how far tax preparation programs have come. The three major companies \u2014 TurboTax, H&R Block and TaxACT \u2014 now offer online products and apps that enable you to bounce back and forth between your computer, your tablet and your smartphone as you work on your return.\n\nAnd this year\u2019s tablet apps represent an important advance: They let you fill out your return by tapping and swiping through interviews about your life circumstances, income and expenses. If you reach a point where you\u2019d rather use an old-fashioned keyboard, you save your work, switch to your desktop or laptop computer and pick up where you left off.\n\nFor this review, I tried TurboTax Home & Business, H&R Block Premium and TaxACT\u2019s Ultimate Bundle. Based on my experiences, all three work fine for a family with a house, an investment portfolio composed mostly of mutual funds and additional income from freelance work.\n\nThe strengths by which each maker has distinguished itself endure.\n\n\u2022 TurboTax was headache-free \u2014 everything I had to do within the program was intuitive and worked without a catch.\n\n\u2022 H&R Block offered the easiest access to tax advisers and, in my nonprofessional opinion, the best advice.\n\n\u2022 TaxACT remains a bargain.\n\nWhen I was using the programs in late January, TurboTax was charging $80 for Home and Business and $37 for each state return. H&R Block was charging $50 for Premium and $37 for each state return. TaxACT was charging $20 for its Ultimate Bundle, which includes a federal and a state return. (These prices can change, and downloadable versions cost more.)\n\nMy guess is that technophiles will prefer TurboTax, worriers will gravitate to H&R Block and the thrifty will opt for TaxACT. My experiences may explain why.\n\nTurboTax\n\nThe biggest time saver offered by all three programs is the ability to import personal and financial information. TurboTax has long excelled here. This year, I imported a PDF of my family\u2019s last return to TurboTax\u2019s cloud without problems. From there, I jumped into the interview questions. Thanks to the import, there was little information to type besides this year\u2019s numbers, and many of those could be pulled in electronically. TurboTax can import information from more than 1 million employers and financial companies, said Colleen A. Gatlin, spokeswoman for Intuit, the company that makes TurboTax.\n\nTurboTax also provided the best smartphone app. Gatlin said the phone app had nearly all the same features as the online program, including the option to file an itemized return. (The phone apps for H&R Block and TaxACT allow only for simpler returns.) I couldn\u2019t test every feature of the TurboTax app, but I used it enough to annoy my wife \u2014 playing with our return in the grocery store and restaurants \u2014 and I was impressed by how easy it was to use. People who don\u2019t itemize can use any of the three to file.\n\nA concern about TurboTax this year might be security, given the news on Feb. 6 about attempts to use the program to file bogus returns. At the time, Intuit temporarily suspended the electronic filing of state returns after seeing an uptick in suspicious filings. Gatlin said that the attempts had not resulted from the breaches of Intuit\u2019s security, but rather from identity thefts elsewhere, and that normal filing had resumed within about a day.\n\nWhen I review tax software, I try to test the company\u2019s customer service by posing a question about the tax consequences of an unusual situation my spouse and I face. This time, it was her sabbatical from her job as a professor. I asked whether we could deduct the travel and lodging expenses from her stints at two universities far from home.\n\nTurboTax offers several kinds of assistance. First is its online community, AnswerXchange, which the website says is composed of \u201cTurboTax support experts and customers just like you.\u201d (Given my near total ignorance of tax law, I\u2019m not sure I want guidance from the likes of me.) The community resembles the comment string at the end of an online article or blog posting: You can pose a question, and registered users can answer. Or you can search previously answered questions.\n\nI dutifully filed my question, and a community member, who called herself TurboTaxNatasha, responded to my inquiry within an hour. She suggested that a sabbatical might count as nondeductible \u201ceducational travel.\u201d I pointed out that my wife\u2019s sabbatical was primarily devoted to research, not sipping sauvignon blanc in the south of France. TurboTaxNatasha waffled: \u201cI recommend that your wife speak with her employer or contact the IRS directly.\u201d\n\nI wondered how \u201chelp\u201d from TurboTax could entail instructions to call the IRS That seemed more akin to punishment \u2014 especially since the tax agency has warned that this year\u2019s telephone wait times could top 30 minutes.\n\nI then tried TurboTax\u2019s phone assistance \u2014 and inadvertently misdialed the software help line. Eventually, I ended up in the right place and reached a TurboTax representative who identified herself as Bonnie P. We chatted for about 15 minutes. She quizzed me and concluded that the sabbatical expenses were probably deductible \u2014 they were work-related and seemed necessary \u2014 but added that she knew of no applicable IRS regulation.\n\nH&R Block\n\nGetting an answer from H&R Block proved easier, which highlighted the company\u2019s strength. H&R Block uses its nationwide staff of tax pros \u2014 it operates a chain of more than 11,000 tax preparation shops \u2014 to backstop its online customer service.\n\nAs with TurboTax, you\u2019re encouraged to start by searching a repository of previously answered questions. If that doesn\u2019t work, you can click on a box taking you to an online chat or a phone number. I opted for the Web chat and soon reached \u201cYoung L.\u201d Young pointed me to a passage in the 2014 IRS Publication 17 tax guide. It explained that a professor\u2019s expenses relating to research and teaching, including travel, often can be deducted, but the wording did offer a little wiggle room for the IRS.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only way H&R Block distinguishes itself.\n\nThe company also offers customers the promise of in-person representation by an H&R Block expert, at no additional cost, in the case of an IRS audit. Audits are rare \u2014 the IRS does in-person examinations of about only 1 percent of returns \u2014 but the guarantee is like an insurance policy: A major relief if needed. TurboTax charges Home and Business customers $60 for this service, and TaxACT charges $40 for all filers. Both require that you buy it before filing your return.\n\nOtherwise, H&R Block\u2019s software worked much like TurboTax, though not as smoothly. For reasons unclear (the fault could have been mine) my browser, Safari, froze as I was importing last year\u2019s return to the H&R Block website. I quit and signed into my online account again, and the pertinent information was there.\n\nTax filing will be different this year because of the Affordable Care Act. For the first time, people must provide their health insurance information on their returns, so all three programs include this topic in their interview questions. If you have employer-provided insurance, you simply answer a few yes-or-no questions, no matter which program you use.\n\nH&R Block also has added an informative feature called Refund Reveal. All three programs keep a running tally of your tax payment or refund as you answer their interview questions. With H&R Block, if you click on that amount, you see a breakdown of what\u2019s contributing to your total. TaxACT gives a less detailed tally.\n\nTaxACT\n\nTaxACT provided the most improved experience this year.\n\nIn the past, I\u2019ve occasionally found it more difficult to use than TurboTax or H&R Block, and once in a while its instructions would confuse me. This year, the online program wouldn\u2019t import the PDF of last year\u2019s return. When I tried, I got a message saying the upload had failed, which meant I had to type everything in. But beyond that, its offering and apps worked just as well as the others.\n\nLike TurboTax and H&R Block, the program asks questions about your circumstances and finances. There is a difference, however. The interview seems to mention farming more often, perhaps reflecting the company\u2019s roots in the Corn Belt. (TaxACT is based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.)\n\nI emailed TaxACT, too, with my question about the sabbatical expenses. One of its helpers, Jeff, emailed back within four hours. He didn\u2019t confirm that we could get a deduction, but he did provide a critical piece of information, explaining the IRS\u2019 definition of ordinary and necessary business expenses.\n\nFinally, TaxACT\u2019s prices continue to impress. For a federal and a state return, it would have cost my family nearly $100 less than TurboTax \u2014 recall that TaxACT\u2019s Ultimate Bundle is only $20. If you fret over the portion of your paycheck that\u2019s given to Uncle Sam \u2014 and who doesn\u2019t? \u2014 it might be worth a try.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The three major companies \u2014 TurboTax, H&R Block and TaxACT \u2014 now offer online products and apps that enable you to bounce back and forth between your computer, your tablet and your smartphone as you work on your return.", "og": {"site_name": "The Seattle Times", "description": "The three major companies \u2014 TurboTax, H&R Block and TaxACT \u2014 now offer online products and apps that enable you to bounce back and forth between your computer, your tablet and your smartphone as you work on your return.", "title": "Better software lets you kick back and do your taxes | Review", "url": "http://www.seattletimes.com/business/better-software-lets-you-kick-back-and-do-your-taxes-review/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-facebook.png", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Better software lets you kick back and do your taxes | Review", "description": "The three major companies \u2014 TurboTax, H&R Block and TaxACT \u2014 now offer online products and apps that enable you to bounce back and forth between your computer, your tablet and your smartphone as you work on your return.", "card": "http://www.seattletimes.com/wp-content/themes/st_refresh/img/st-meta-twitter.png", "site": "@seattletimes"}, "robots": "noarchive", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=329502124", "fb": {"admins": 2737159, "app_id": 1522735777957334, "pages": 38472826214}, "msvalidate.01": "29FBBD36D14799A9FDE7843BF1E1CDD7", "article": {"section": "Business", "published_time": "2015-03-09 12:10:50", "modified_time": "2015-03-09 12:37:37"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Business"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1c20\"", "article_summary": "With H&R Block, if you click on that amount, you see a breakdown of what\u2019s contributing to your total.\nH&R BlockGetting an answer from H&R Block proved easier, which highlighted the company\u2019s strength.\n\u2022 H&R Block offered the easiest access to tax advisers and, in my nonprofessional opinion, the best advice.\nTrying to do a tax return while lying on the couch, iPad balanced on my chest and a basketball game playing in the background, was admittedly distracting.\nFor this review, I tried TurboTax Home & Business, H&R Block Premium and TaxACT\u2019s Ultimate Bundle."}
