However, primary care doctors are apparently already dealing with more patients than they can handle, CNSNews.com\n\n\"Furthermore, physicians are worried that exchange plan patients will be sicker than the average patient because they may have been without insurance for extended periods of time, and therefore will require more of the PCPs time at lower pay,\" the study reported.\n\nThen, there is also concern among health care providers-hospitals and physicians-that patients enrolled in the new exchange plans do not fully understand their benefits and obligations, which might lead for the doctors to not receive payment at all.\n\nAccording to an MGMA study, \"75 percent of ACA patients that had seen doctors had chosen plans with high deductibles. Given that most of the patients are low-income, doctors are concerned that the patients cannot meet the deductibles and they will get stuck with the bill.\"\n\nThe chief reason, however, doctors are opting out of the exchange plan is that the HHS requirement has allowed about a million people to cancel their exchange plans and shy away from paying premiums.\n\nAccording to HHS regulation, a 90-day \"grace period\" is provided for insurers to cover customers after they have stopped paying their premiums. During this grace period, the insurer is required to continue coverage for 30 days, but after that, it is upon the doctor to recover payment for the last 60 days directly from the patient.\n\nThough final numbers are not available yet, current estimates indicate that nearly 1 million individuals enrolled in exchange plans have failed to pay their premiums to date.\n\nSo it would be an obvious question to ask: Why would doctors choose to take on sicker patients for less money under Obamacare, when there is an additional risk of not receiving payment at all?", "article_metadata": {"Description": "Participation under the Affordable Health Care for America Act (ACA) exchange health plans is being declined by over 214,000 American physicians, according to a new survey by Medical Group Management Association, a trade group comprised of multi-physician medical practices.", "Copyright": "2016 Headlines & Global News", "Author": "Headlines & Global News", "og": {"site_name": "Headlines & Global News", "description": "Participation under the Affordable Health Care for America Act (ACA) exchange health plans is being declined by over 214,000 American physicians, according to a new survey by Medical Group Management Association, a trade group comprised of multi-physician medical practices.", "title": "Obamacare: More Than 214,000 Health Care Providers Are Opting Out Of Obamacare Exchange Plans Due To Burdensome Costs", "url": "http://www.hngn.com/articles/47589/20141101/more-214-000-health-care-providers-opting-out-obamacare-exchange.htm", "image": "http://images.hngn.com/data/images/full/35763/obamacare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "hngn.com", "description": "Participation under the Affordable Health Care for America Act (ACA) exchange health plans is being declined by over 214,000 American physicians, according to a new survey by Medical Group Management Association, a trade group comprised of multi-physician medical practices.", "title": "Obamacare: More Than 214,000 Health Care Providers Are Opting Out Of Obamacare Exchange Plans Due To Burdensome Costs", "url": "http://www.hngn.com/articles/47589/20141101/more-214-000-health-care-providers-opting-out-obamacare-exchange.htm", "image": "http://images.hngn.com/data/images/full/35763/obamacare.jpg", "creator": "@HNGNcom", "site": "@HNGNcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.hngn.com/articles/47589/20141101/more-214-000-health-care-providers-opting-out-obamacare-exchange.htm", "robots": "index, follow", "Googlebot-News": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Headlines & Global News", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-01"}, "news_keywords": "more, 214, 000, health, care, providers, opting, out, obamacare, exchange", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0;", "Subject": "hngn.com"}, "article_summary": "Crafted in 2009, \"the Affordable Care Act actually refers to two separate pieces of legislation - the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L.\nObamacare: More Than 214,000 Health Care Providers Are Opting Out Of Obamacare Exchange Plans Due To Burdensome CostsParticipation under the Affordable Health Care for America Act (ACA) exchange health plans is being declined by over 214,000 American physicians, according to a new survey by Medical Group Management Association, a trade group comprised of multi-physician medical practices.\nIn order to make up for the lost revenue from Obamacare, physicians will be expected to increase their patient lists.\nNov 01, 2014 02:41 PM EDTThe number of Obamacare plans nationwide offering on-demand abortion is skyrocketing despite a rule that bars using healthcare subsidies for the procedure.\nThough final numbers are not available yet, current estimates indicate that nearly 1 million individuals enrolled in exchange plans have failed to pay their premiums to date."}
