Thieves stole thousands of dollars worth of belongings from a Wichita family. Police say it happened Sunday morning in south Wichita near 43rd and Gold St.

Billy Siedl tells KAKE News that around 2:30 a.m. burglars broke through his fence and into a shed to steal 4-wheelers and chainsaws. Siedl is most concerned about the loss of the blue Yamaha Blaster and Banshee ATV's together worth around $4,000.

"I got it last night actually, but the Yahama Banshee that I had in there that they took too," said Seidl.

Seidl says whomever did this must have known his set up.

"The camera's right there," Seidl said as he pointed to surveillance cameras pointed toward the shed. "I think they got up on this chair and unplugged the red one, because you can unplug the red one and it will stop the video."

Surveillance video doesn't show the suspects' faces but shows a hand unplugging the camera and then an hour later plugging it back in.

Seidl says the thieves took more than just his property, they took away his favorite hobby.

"It's the only thing I had to my name I worked really hard for it, I ride it everyday back here, I loved it," he said.

Seidl says he reported the thefts to police. He tells KAKE News he's offering a $400 reward for information leading to the return of all the stolen items. If you know where they are you're asked to call Crimestoppers at 267-2111.
