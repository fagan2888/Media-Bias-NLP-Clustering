(WIVB) \u2013 Eastern Niagara Hospital employees in Newfane learned Wednesday morning that half of them will out of a job.\n\nThe restructuring plan at the William Street site will consolidate inpatient care and surgical services at the hospital\u2019s Lockport site on East Avenue. The Newfane site will maintain its 24-hour emergency department, in addition to some outpatient services.\n\nThere are approximately 560 full-time employees at Eastern Niagara Hospital, with 123 at the Newfane site. Janice Dierolf is one of 60 employees at the Newfane site that will soon be searching for a new job.\n\nShe told News 4, \u201cIn two to three months, I\u2019ll be losing my job and I\u2019ve been there for going on three years.\u201d\n\nThe communities surrounding the hospital knew changes were coming and they\u2019ve been fighting against them.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it was going to be this soon,\u201d said Dierolf.\n\nMany residents told News 4 this is all the result of mismanagement. However, CEO Clair Haar said there were unavoidable due to financial issues. She says it\u2019s the result of a decrease in patients, reduced reimbursements and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHaar said, \u201cHealthcare is undergoing a very significant change. Hospitalizations are decreasing and work is shifting to outpatient care, so we are reacting to the shifts that are occurring.\u201d\n\nOutpatient services like dialysis, lab work and rehabilitation will remain. The emergency room will also stay open.\n\nPhil Tenneson, the owner of the Lake Ontario Motel in Newfane, has been supporting the fight to keep the hospital open.\n\nHe said, \u201cAt least they\u2019re keeping the emergency room open and some things like that but still the inpatient thing is a really important part for this area.\u201d\n\nIn March, community members had an emergency meeting on how to save the hospital. It has been in Newfane for more than 50 years, and became Eastern Niagara Hospital about five years ago.\n\nHaar said, \u201cWe have the capacity at the Lockport site to absorb the work.\u201d\n\nHowever, it won\u2019t absorb nearly half of the employees who are now out of work.\n\nTenneson said, \u201cI was there this spring and I got what I thought was really good care and I\u2019m disappointed that to see those people lose their jobs; it just doesn\u2019t seem right.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The restructuring plan at the William Street site will consolidate inpatient care and surgical services at the hospital\u2019s Lockport site on E\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wivb", "og": {"site_name": "wivb.com", "description": "The restructuring plan at the William Street site will consolidate inpatient care and surgical services at the hospital\u2019s Lockport site on East Avenue.", "title": "Eastern Niagara Hospital announces 60 layoffs", "url": "http://wivb.com/2014/07/02/eastern-niagara-hospital-announces-60-layoffs/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "https://lintvwivb.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/eastern-niagara-hospital-newfane-site-2.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The restructuring plan at the William Street site will consolidate inpatient care and surgical services at the hospital\u2019s Lockport site on East Avenue.", "title": "Eastern Niagara Hospital announces 60 layoffs", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwivb.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/eastern-niagara-hospital-newfane-site-2.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@news4buffalo", "site": "news4buffalo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Buffalo News, Buffalo Weather | WIVB-TV News 4 Buffalo, NY | WIVB.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488276218", "fb": {"pages": 83900655504}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "application-name": "wivb.com", "google-site-verification": "rCC8KvhYhxYynxDuL7C_fyWPtSiu1m13vV8Xe8bufDg", "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/news4buffalo", "published_time": "2014-07-02T17:17:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-02T21:56:29+00:00"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wivb.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/f7d9afd22abc1421f3f3acc9bc34faf7?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1de1\"", "article_summary": "Related Coverage Residents plan to fight to keep Newfane hospital operatingNEWFANE, N.Y.
