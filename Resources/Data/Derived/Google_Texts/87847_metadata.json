The Indians, who have the majors\u2019 worst fielding percentage, prolonged both innings with errors in their fourth straight loss overall and seventh in a row in the Bronx.\n\nThe Yankees walked seven times in moving seven games above .500 (61-54) for the first time this season.\n\nPicked up off waivers on July 31 after the Toronto Blue Jays cut him for the second time this season, Rogers (2-0) became the 12th player to make a start for New York.\n\nPitching in place of David Phelps (elbow inflammation), he allowed one run and four hits over five innings in his first start since Sept. 25 for Toronto and threw 88 pitches \u2013 45 was his high this season coming in.\n\nRogers\u2019 outing followed four fine starts by a makeshift rotation against the Detroit Tigers\u2019 heralded staff. Three of those came from pitchers who made their first start for the Yankees in July: Brandon McCarthy, Chris Capuano and Shane Greene.\n\nThe Yankees took advantage of three walks by Bauer in the first inning. Beltran, Stephen Drew and Martin Prado had RBI singles and another run scored on second baseman Jason Kipnis\u2019 throwing error.\n\nBauer was charged with five runs and six hits in 3 1-3 innings.\n\nJohn Axford walked the bases loaded \u2014 one intentional \u2014 before Beltran connected to make it 9-2.\n\nYankees reliever Shawn Kelley walked in a run in Cleveland\u2019s four-run seventh. Carlos Santana had a two-run double in the inning.\n\nMLB all-time hits leaders\n\n1. Pete Rose \u2014 4,256\n\n2. Ty Cobb \u2014 4,191\n\n3. Hank Aaron \u2014 3,771\n\n4.
