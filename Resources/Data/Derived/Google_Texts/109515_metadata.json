You learn such a lot in your debut season, but the second year is when you can really pull all of those new experiences together and show your true potential.\n\nMarussia team principal John Booth said continuity was important due to next year's rule changes in the sport.\n\n\"It is highly beneficial to our technical team that we retain the same driver line-up moving forward,\" he said.\n\n\"Max had an impressive debut season last year and, of course, achieved a new rookie record for finishing all 19 races.\n\n\"After our success in achieving 10th place in the Constructors' Championship, we have set our sights on a bigger and better 2014 campaign,\" Booth added.\n\n(Reporting by Ed Osmond, editing by Clare Lovell)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Briton Max Chilton will stay with Marussia next season and drive alongside Jules Bianchi, the Formula One team said on Saturday.", "title": "Chilton to stay with Marussia in 2014", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140111&t=2&i=828594609&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA0A0ZEU00", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - News", "sailthru.tags": "US, MOTOR, RACING, MARUSSIA, CHILTON", "sailthru.title": "Chilton to stay with Marussia in 2014", "keywords": "US,MOTOR,RACING,MARUSSIA,CHILTON,Euro Zone,Motor Racing,United Kingdom,Western Europe,Europe,Germany,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Central / Eastern Europe", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "news_keywords": "US;MOTOR;RACING;MARUSSIA;CHILTON;Euro Zone;Motor Racing;United Kingdom;Western Europe;Europe;Germany;Sport;Government Borrowing Requirement;Central / Eastern Europe", "WT.cg_n": "Life", "sailthru.description": "Briton Max Chilton will stay with Marussia next season and drive alongside Jules Bianchi, the Formula One team said on Saturday.", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "sportsNews", "sailthru.date": "2014-01-11T12:44:54+0000", "DCSext.ChannelList": "sportsNews;treasuryMarkets;samsung", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "Chilton+to+stay+with+Marussia+in+2014", "DCSext.ContentID": "USBREA0A09G20140111", "WT.cg_s": "Sports", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140111&t=2&i=828594609&w=&fh=50&fw=50&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA0A0ZEU00", "description": "Briton Max Chilton will stay with Marussia next season and drive alongside Jules Bianchi, the Formula One team said on Saturday.", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "DCSext.ContentID_sportsNews": "USBREA0A09G20140111", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "DCSext.rAuthor": "Reuters Editorial", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/sports/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "DCSext.PageTotal": 1, "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-sportsNews", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "Briton Max Chilton will stay with Marussia next season and drive alongside Jules Bianchi, the Formula One team said on Saturday.", "title": "Chilton to stay with Marussia in 2014", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140111&t=2&i=828594609&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA0A0ZEU00", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-motor-racing-marussia-chilton-idUSBREA0A09G20140111", "article": {"section": "Life", "tag": "US,MOTOR,RACING,MARUSSIA,CHILTON,Euro Zone,Motor Racing,United Kingdom,Western Europe,Europe,Germany,Sport,Government Borrowing Requirement,Central / Eastern Europe", "published_time": "2014-01-11T12:44:54+0000", "modified_time": "2014-01-11T12:44:54+0000", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}, "type": "article"}, "REVISION_DATE": "Sat Jan 11 12:44:54 UTC 2014", "DCSext.contentversion": "original", "sailthru.image.full": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140111&t=2&i=828594609&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA0A0ZEU00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2e3e\"", "article_summary": "LONDON Briton Max Chilton will stay with Marussia next season and drive alongside Jules Bianchi, the Formula One team said on Saturday.\n\"I am really happy to be continuing with the Marussia F1 Team into a second season,\" Chilton said in a statement.\nMarussia Formula One driver Max Chilton of Britain poses on the track ahead of the weekend's Belgian F1 Grand Prix in Spa-Francorchamps August 22, 2013.\nMarussia team principal John Booth said continuity was important due to next year's rule changes in the sport.\n\"Max had an impressive debut season last year and, of course, achieved a new rookie record for finishing all 19 races."}
