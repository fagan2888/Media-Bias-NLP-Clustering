True, a Clinton win would carry with it disastrous consequences for the nation, from Supreme Court picks to the setting in concrete of ObamaCare. But let us not concede for a minute that we should hold our nose and vote for Donald Trump just because he is allegedly the proverbial lesser of two evils.\n\nSupporters of Donald Trump are valiantly trying to replace #nevertrump with #getoverit. Many are chanting the mantra that not voting for Trump is a vote for Hillary Clinton. One wonders if the corollary is also true. Since I am not voting for Hillary Clinton, by their logic not voting for Hillary should be a vote for Trump, right?\n\nHillary Clinton is certainly the devil we know. The problem is that Donald Trump is the devil don\u2019t know, a political chameleon who admittedly gets his information from the Sunday talk shows and writes his policies on an Etch-A-Sketch. As Breitbart reported, Trump told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd:\n\nSunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d when host Chuck Todd questioned Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump on his military positions, Trump said he watches television shows for military advice\u2026 Todd asked, \u201cWho do you talk to for military advice right now?\u201d Trump answered, \u201cWell, I watch the shows. I mean, I really see a lot of great -- you know, when you watch your show, and all of the other shows, and you have the generals, and you have certain people --\u201d\n\nMeet Donald Trump -- Presidential Apprentice, whose stream-of-consciousness foreign policy utterances make little sense such as this gem on what we should do about ISIS:\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump stated the US should let ISIS and Bashar al-Assad fight and \u201ctake over the remnants\u201d and \u201clet Russia fight ISIS\u201d in Syria in an interview broadcast on Wednesday\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d on CNN.\n\nRussia is not fighting ISIS and any credible candidate seeking access to the nuclear codes would know that. Russia has been bombing the Syrian resistance with one goal in mind -- keeping the murderous Bashar al-Assad in power. At best, this is an isolationist endorsement of President Obama\u2019s abandonment of America\u2019s leadership in the world.\n\nTrump would create power vacuums all over place which the bad guys would gladly fill, such as President Obama left in Iraq.\n\nTrump considers Iraq a failure by President George W. Bush, yet it was a great victory. Both Shiites and Sunnis learned to work together under an America that had both their backs and acted as referee in disputes. Women proudly held their purple fingers aloft after voting for the first time in a free Iraq. Yes, we were propping up a Baghdad incapable of defending itself, just as we prop up South Korea and Japan seven decades after World War II. And just as we prop up a NATO incapable of defending itself without our help.\n\nWe do it because it is in our national interest to do it. Let France and Germany be \u201cfree-riders\u201d. Let America also be what it used to be -- leader of the Free World. Trump\u2019s view that NATO is \u201cobsolete\u201d and American participation in it questionable is a Putin dream come true, one that would throw away President Ronald Reagan\u2019s Cold War victory. His statements reveal a glaring naivet\u00e9 about the world:\n\nI think NATO is obsolete. NATO was done at a time you had the Soviet Union, which was obviously larger -- much larger than Russia is today. I'm not saying Russia is not a threat. But we have other threats. We have the threat of terrorism. And NATO doesn't discuss terrorism. NATO's not meant for terrorism. NATO doesn't have the right countries in it for terrorism\u2026 And if you look at the Ukraine, we're the ones always fighting on the Ukraine. I never hear any other countries even mentioned and we're fighting constantly. We're talking about Ukraine, get out, do this, do that. And I mean Ukraine is very far away from us. How come the countries near the Ukraine, surrounding the Ukraine, how come they're not opening up and they're not at least protesting?\n\nPerhaps they are intimidated by a rapidly rearming Russia and dismayed by an America that let Russia annex the Crimea and let Russia invade Ukraine to pull it back into a reconstituted Soviet-style empire, an empire Ronald Reagan rightly called \u201cevil\u201d and which Trump seems not to want to do anything about. All we\u2019re doing about Ukraine is talking. Would Trump push for Ukraine\u2019s admission into an \u201cobsolete\u201d NATO? I think not. Terrorism is a threat, but these days it is not the top threat to Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, which are also \u201cvery far away from us\u201d. Trump should know we are no longer protected by two oceans and a the 600-ship navy Reagan built. Russian, and Chinese and, soon enough, Iranian and North Korean ICBMs have made the world a very small place.\n\nTrump\u2019s view of former KGB chief Putin is na\u00efve and dangerous:\n\nAfter Putin praised Trump on Thursday as \"bright and talented\" and \"the absolute leader of the presidential race,\" the billionaire trumpeted Putin's praise as a \"great honor\" and even shrugged off widespread allegations that the Russian president has ordered the killing of journalists and political dissidents.\n\n\"He's running his country and at least he's a leader, unlike what we have in this country,\" Trump said Friday morning on MSNBC. \"I think our country does plenty of killing also.\"\n\nYes, like other expansionist despots before him, Putin is a leader who runs his country. I\u2019m sure the Moscow subway runs on time too. Reagan would have stood up to Putin, just as he stood up to Gorbachev and told him to tear down the Berlin Wall. Somehow I can\u2019t imagine Trump doing that. Nor was there any \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d at Reykjavik in 1986. As Investor\u2019s Business Daily noted:\n\nWhen Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev met Ronald Reagan in Reykjavik, Iceland, in October 1986, he hoped the U.S. president would be willing to trade his Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) away in exchange for arms-control agreements and vague promises of making nice with America. Reagan refused to negotiate the SDI away. He opposed the proposed nuclear freeze and put Pershing missiles in Europe to counter the Soviet SS-20s that were targeted on Western Europe. He put America\u2019s security in the hands of American technology, not the goodwill of its enemies.\n\nWould Trump have countered Soviet expansionism by means of deploying SS-20s, or would he have dealt away the U.S. missile defense in its infancy? Or would he have played \u201cLet\u2019s Make a Deal\u201d with Gorbachev? Trump is a dealmaker unlikely to have a strategy of \u201cwe win, they lose\u201d as Reagan did.\n\nTrump likes to fancy himself as a new Reagan and claims his mantle even as he trashes him, referring to him in his book, Art of the Deal as a \u201cconman\u201d who couldn\u2019t \u201cdeliver the goods\u201d. ThinkProgress noted in 2011, Trump\u2019s professed admiration for Reagan was merely a head fake:\n\n\u2026 in his bestselling book, Art of the Deal, published at the conclusion of the Reagan presidency, Trump cited Reagan as an example of someone who could \u201ccon people\u201d but couldn\u2019t \u201cdeliver the goods.\u201d Trump said Reagan was \u201cso smooth\u201d that he \u201cwon over the American people.\u201d But at the conclusion of his presidency, \u201cpeople are beginning to question whether there is anything beneath that smile,\u201d Trump writes.\n\nI am not #NeverTrump. I am \u201cnone of the above\u201d. Hillary Clinton is dangerous because of what she would do. Donald Trump is dangerous because he doesn\u2019t know what he is doing or saying. I will vote with my feet and stay home. If the Almighty really does look after drunks, children, and the United States of America, I\u2019ll put my faith and my vote there. But I will not sacrifice my core principles and vote for a dealmaker who doesn\u2019t appear to have any.\n\nDaniel John Sobieski is a freelance writer whose pieces have appeared in Investor\u2019s Business Daily, Human Events, Reason Magazine and the Chicago Sun-Times among other publications.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2016/05/sometimes_theres_no_lesser_of_two_evils.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Articles: Sometimes There's no Lesser of Two Evils"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But let us not concede for a minute that we should hold our nose and vote for Donald Trump just because he is allegedly the proverbial lesser of two evils.\nSupporters of Donald Trump are valiantly trying to replace #nevertrump with #getoverit.\nDonald Trump is dangerous because he doesn\u2019t know what he is doing or saying.\nSince I am not voting for Hillary Clinton, by their logic not voting for Hillary should be a vote for Trump, right?\nThe problem is that Donald Trump is the devil don\u2019t know, a political chameleon who admittedly gets his information from the Sunday talk shows and writes his policies on an Etch-A-Sketch."}
