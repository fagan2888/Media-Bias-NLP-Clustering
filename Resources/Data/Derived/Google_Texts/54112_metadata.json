They held their breath every time another block was removed, and screamed whenever the wind gently shook the unstable structure.\n\nMahala Holiday, 8, slurped a flavored ice pop and moved to remove a loose block from the center of the game. The group of spectators clapped when the tower shuddered but remained standing.\n\nMahala\u2019s mother, Gerilyn Holiday, 40, cheered and laughed as her daughter backed away from the game triumphantly. Around the backyard of the library, about 50 children and their parents were slurping ice cream in the shade, blowing bubbles and bowling for bottles of colored, water-filled bottles during Commerce City\u2019s mySummer kickoff party June 2 at 7185 Monaco St.\n\n\u201cThis year\u2019s mySummer program has a STEAM emphasis \u2014 science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics,\u201d said Stacie Ledden, spokesperson for the six Anythink branches in Adams County. \u201cAs always, the programs are hands-on and a whole lot of fun, but the topics this year range from the environment to physics to robotics, and much more.\u201d\n\nThe kickoff parties have been a standing tradition for the annual mySummer programming, which each branch hosts from the end of May through Aug. 31. Aligning with this year\u2019s theme, all library branches are offering creative, science-based activities almost every day Monday through Friday. A complete list of summer activities at each branch can be found on the library website.\n\nDeborah Hogue, branch manager in Commerce City, said this mySummer series is poised to be the best yet with a wide variety of special events and craft activities, including making tie-dyed Japanese scarfs, body scrubs and sun-printed shirts.\n\n\u201cAll branches received four paid programs this year in addition to the kits that our youth guides have put together,\u201d Hogue said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge selection of educational projects and games that will keep families busy all summer.\u201d\n\nSome partner programs include demonstrations from Mad Science, Science Matters and WOW! Children\u2019s Museum, an interactive museum in Lafayette. Ledden said programs are open to people from birth to 100 years old.\n\n\u201cWe have something for all ages and interests,\u201d she said. \u201cFor adults, there are tons of programs that focus on making \u2014 you can learn how to solder, make your own woodburned jewelry or build your own robots.\u201d\n\nAnythink Wright Farms at 5877 E. 120th Ave. in Thornton will also host its second, free summer concert series starting at 6:30 p.m. June 13 at the 1-acre, outdoor park adjacent to the branch. Food from Dickey\u2019s Barbecue Pit in Westminster and drinks from Beer By Design in Northglenn will be for sale.\n\nThere will be one concert a month from June to August. All shows are at the same time, in the same location.\n\n\u201cPeople from all over bring their lawn chairs and blankets to sit on the lawn at Anythink Wright Farms and enjoy some eclectic music,\u201d Ledden said. \u201cAll of the proceeds from food and beverage sales go to the Anythink Foundation and will help us fund our Explore Outdoors outdoor classroom at Anythink Brighton.\u201d\n\nAt the mySummer kickoff party in Commerce City, kids left with their own book totes and pamphlets for the next month\u2019s planned activities.\n\n\u201cWe plan to be here every day next week,\u201d Holiday said. \u201cWe have a calendar at home with stickers placed on all the days where there are (library) activities that we want to attend, and the week is basically full of stickers.\u201d\n\nIf you go\u2026\n\nWhat: Anythink Wright Farms free summer concert series\n\nWhen: 6:30 p.m. June 13\n\nWhere: Anythink Wright Farms, 5877 E. 120th Ave., Thornton\n\nFor more information: Visit\n\nanythinklibraries.org/ location/anythink-wright-farms", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Adams County Anythink libraries launch mySummer series, free concerts", "title": "Adams County Anythink libraries launch mySummer series, free concerts", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/10/adams-county-anythink-libraries-launch-mysummer-series-free-concerts/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-10T14:24:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-10T14:24:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cPeople from all over bring their lawn chairs and blankets to sit on the lawn at Anythink Wright Farms and enjoy some eclectic music,\u201d Ledden said.\nCOMMERCE CITY \u2014A group of seven children kept a safe distance from a giant Jenga game that they had stacked up higher than most of their heads in the backyard of Anythink Library in Commerce City.\nMahala Holiday, 8, slurped a flavored ice pop and moved to remove a loose block from the center of the game.\nThey held their breath every time another block was removed, and screamed whenever the wind gently shook the unstable structure.\nAligning with this year\u2019s theme, all library branches are offering creative, science-based activities almost every day Monday through Friday."}
