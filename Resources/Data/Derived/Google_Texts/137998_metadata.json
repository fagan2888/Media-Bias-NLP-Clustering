He is paid about $8 an hour.\n\nBowles, 45, is uninsured.\n\nMoney is not the reason as he tells it, although he discloses he didn\u2019t file his taxes last year because his income wasn\u2019t high enough. He\u2019s also aware there\u2019s financial assistance for low-income people like him. And he knows about the federal requirement to have coverage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWill he sign up this year before open enrollment ends Jan. 31?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking about it,\u201d Bowles said one afternoon this month.\n\nInside the insurance agency that Bowles is hawking, called Obamacare and more, agent Seif Sidky confesses he\u2019s been too busy helping customers to talk to Bowles about enrolling.\n\n\u201cI do see the irony,\u201d he said, absorbing the incongruity of a worker pitching Obamacare while lacking insurance himself.\n\nBowles\u2019 situation epitomizes the challenge for advocates, brokers and federally-funded navigators in Florida and also nationally in this third Obamacare open enrollment season. Their shared goal: Increase the number of Americans buying health plans. It won\u2019t be easy. About 1.3 million Floridians signed up for individual coverage during the 2015 open enrollment on the online marketplace created by the Affordable Care Act. That was tops in the country \u2013 even higher than in California and Texas, which have more people. Like most states, Florida\u2019s uninsured rate has fallen sharply \u2013 to 15 percent from 22 percent in 2013, according to Gallup.\n\nTo encourage more people to sign up in Florida, Obamacare assisters are handing out flyers at food truck festivals, farmers\u2019 markets and health fairs. They\u2019re giving one-on-one enrollment assistance at libraries, hospitals and community centers. They\u2019re even showing up after church services to sign up people.\n\nTammy Myers, a navigator with the Epilepsy Foundation of Florida, was passing out information about Obamacare on Thursday evening at a Deerfield Beach, Fla. park where 25 food trucks were peddling dinner options from Maine lobster to Cuban sandwiches.\n\nPeople must be reminded about their need for coverage, Myers said, as well as the many new options to help them afford it. On Nov. 1, the first day of enrollment, she helped sign up four uninsured people at a Fort Lauderdale church who were inspired to act by their minister\u2019s suggestion during the service.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take Myers long to find people who needed help in Deerfield Beach.\n\nTravis Long was sitting in a folding chair watching customers walk to his Key West Conch Shack & Grill truck. Long, 44, has been uninsured since he bought the truck two years ago, after leaving his corporate job and the employer-sponsored health coverage that went with it.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s time for me to sign up\u2026I\u2019ve been putting this off long enough and I know it\u2019s sort of like playing Russian roulette,\u201d he said.\n\nHe paid a $395 federal penalty for not having coverage last year when he could have afforded it. With the fine going up to $695 in 2016, he said it\u2019s not a good idea to spend so much money and still be uninsured. He\u2019s worried about buying a plan with a large deductible or one that doesn\u2019t cover all the doctors and hospitals he would like. But he\u2019d also like a plan that includes dental care.\n\nAt a Palm Beach County library on \u2018A\u2019 Thursday afternoon, about a dozen people came to hear a short talk about Obamacare and get help enrolling. Several groups were there to lend assistance, including the nonprofit Enroll America and the Health Council of Southeast Florida, a federally-funded navigator.\n\nOne attendee was Harriet Cohen, 63, who needed insurance because her county-funded health plan will end in December. Working with a navigator, she determined in less than 30 minutes how much federal subsidy she was eligible for, saw dozens of plans, and picked one.\n\nShe signed up for an Ambetter Health Plan that had a $6.98 monthly premium after the subsidy, a zero deductible, free primary care visits and $10-a-visit fee to see a specialist. Her doctor was not in the plan\u2019s provider network, but Cohen said she didn\u2019t care since there were still many to choose from near her house.\n\n\u201cThis is amazing \u2026 I\u2019m going to try it,\u201d she said, a big smile on her face.\n\nPhoto: Flickr user Will O\u2019Neill", "article_metadata": {"description": "The man holding a signing hawking Obamacare does not have health insurance.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "The man holding a signing hawking Obamacare does not have health insurance.", "title": "Here are the crazy, desperate (and depressing) methods to get final holdouts signed up for health insurance", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/obamacare_pros.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-06T11:49:43-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/11/obamacare-sign-up/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/obamacare_pros.jpg", "description": "The man holding a signing hawking Obamacare does not have health insurance.", "card": "summary", "title": "Meet Obamacare's last holdouts (will they get insurance?)"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,OB, obamacare, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-11-16T10:50:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-06T11:49:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "One attendee was Harriet Cohen, 63, who needed insurance because her county-funded health plan will end in December.\nShe signed up for an Ambetter Health Plan that had a $6.98 monthly premium after the subsidy, a zero deductible, free primary care visits and $10-a-visit fee to see a specialist.\n\u201cI do see the irony,\u201d he said, absorbing the incongruity of a worker pitching Obamacare while lacking insurance himself.\nBowles\u2019 situation epitomizes the challenge for advocates, brokers and federally-funded navigators in Florida and also nationally in this third Obamacare open enrollment season.\nLike most states, Florida\u2019s uninsured rate has fallen sharply \u2013 to 15 percent from 22 percent in 2013, according to Gallup."}
