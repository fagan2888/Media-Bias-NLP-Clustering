He\u2019s appealed his termination (a notion that should be ridiculous on its face) to the Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission. Manney was also the first Wisconsin police officer whose shooting fell under a new law that requires outside agents to lead the investigation.\n\nThat investigation has now found Manney was justified in shooting the unarmed Hamilton 14 times after a scuffle began when Manney told Hamilton he couldn\u2019t sleep on a park bench. Two cops had previously responded to the call about Hamilton and determined he was posing no threat. Manney responded to the call without knowing other officers had previously gone there. Because he was not fired for killing Hamilton but for not following departmental procedures in engaging mentally ill individuals, the district attorney\u2019s decision not to press charges against Manney may not help him get his job back.\n\nThere are also issues with the way the more \u201cindependent\u201d investigation mandated by state law actually went down: half the state agents, and the state\u2019s top investigator, were all former members of the Milwaukee Police Department.\n\nHis termination may not end Manney\u2019s financial relationship with Milwaukee\u2019s taxpayers either, as the Milwaukee Sentinel-Journal reports:\n\nManney also has applied for duty disability, saying the Red Arrow Park shooting and its aftermath resulted in severe post-traumatic stress disorder. He joins a growing number of officers suspected of misconduct who have applied for duty disability claiming debilitating stress, sometimes even citing the department's investigation or media coverage as the cause of that stress. If approved, Manney's retirement \u2014 which would include about 75% of his salary, tax-free \u2014 will take precedence over his dismissal because he applied two days before he was fired.\n\nRead the Journal\u2019s whole story on the rise of duty disability claims by cops embroiled in controversy here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "A few months ago, Christopher Manney became the first officer in 45 years in Milwaukee to be fired as a result of a fatal on-duty shooting.
