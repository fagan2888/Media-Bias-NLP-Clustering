Forget ObamaCare and the administration’s push to hype Medicaid expansion this week. It’s two high-profile, non-office-holding Republicans who are getting top Twitter billing.

Apparently, this is real: MITT, a Netflix documentary. pic.twitter.com/oAyCMtN5v4 — Philip Rucker (@PhilipRucker) December 9, 2013

From Variety: “Netflix is ramping up its documentary business, Netflix has acquired theatrical and TV rights to the Mitt Romney documentary “Mitt” with plans to air it exclusively on Jan. 24.

“Greg Whitely’s documentary, which provides a behind-the-scenes look at Romney’s campaign, will debut on Jan. 17 at Sundance.”

New York Times’ Jonathan Martin tweeted that he and Politico’s Glenn Thrush reported in an e-book that the Romneys found the documentary, “too heavy on his faith,” and he “feared Mormon backlash.”

Dan Zak, staff writer at the Washington Post, tried his hand at creating a cut line for the movie.

Rejected subtitles: "MITT: HE AIN'T BEANBAG." "MITT: HAIR BUD." "MITT: THE MUSICAL!" "MITT: WILLARD." "MITT: ROMNEY." — Dan Zak (@MrDanZak) December 9, 2013

Zak should probably stick to newspapering.

Meanwhile Sarah Palin took to Twitter (reaching one million followers) announcing her new reality show deal with the Sportsman Channel:

Excited to launch a new TV series in April on @SPORTSMANchnl highlighting America's Red, Wild & Blue! http://t.co/vhcIkl6hL6 — Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) December 9, 2013

Palin beats Mitt by a mile on the Twitter snark-o-meter, and the name-calling was heavy-handed among those who thought her new deal was underwhelming.

Fox News contributor Michelle Malkin calls the negativity “haterade,” and compiled the worst of the worst tweets on her blog, including one from a tweeter who hoped Palin would get shot in her trek through the nation’s wilderness.

Congrats @SarahPalinUSA on new Sportsman Channel show! Of course, lib haterade overfloweth ==> http://t.co/VWwbEjFhJu — Michelle Malkin (@michellemalkin) December 9, 2013

No matter what your politics, wishing someone dead on Twitter is pretty pathetic. The show debuts April 2014.

This is what a coordinated Twitter roll-out strategy looks like.

This is why all states should join the 26 that have already decided to expand access to Medicaid under #ACA: pic.twitter.com/rPfjGMfKdw — Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) December 9, 2013

Today, more than 300,000 uninsured Ohioans can sign up for health coverage through expanded Medicaid http://t.co/kCe7tiGVUb — Sherrod Brown (@SenSherrodBrown) December 9, 2013

This strategy is exactly what Zeke Emanuel was talking about on "Fox News Sunday" when he lamented the lack of a coordinated PR effort around the ObamaCare rollout.

And Speaker Boehner is getting an early Christmas Twitter card from Dems demanding he see things their way.

Tell @SpeakerBoehner and the GOP we're paying attention. We won't let our economy be held hostage again. ➨ https://t.co/mlHu2CfAng — Brad Schneider (@Schneider4IL10) December 7, 2013

Bet he’d rather just get a lump of coal.
