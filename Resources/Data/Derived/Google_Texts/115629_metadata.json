Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth. \u201cWe did feel like it was coming along very slowly, but I\u2019m glad to see that it seems like the momentum is picking up.\u201d\n\nKrause\u2019s bill to reform so-called judicial bypass \u2014 the legal process that allows some minors to obtain abortions without their parents\u2019 permission if obtaining consent could endanger the minor \u2014 is among a handful of abortion bills that were referred to the House State Affairs Committee but were never scheduled for a hearing.\n\nKrause said he opted instead to work with state Rep. Geanie Morrison, R-Victoria, who also proposed a bill that would drastically reform judicial bypass. On Monday, the State Affairs Committee voted out Morrison\u2019s measure.\n\n\u201cNow that people are kind of coming together and working with each other, now we\u2019re seeing the flow move a little faster,\u201d Krause said.\n\nThe committee has also approved a proposal by state Rep. Marsha Farney, R-Georgetown, that would ban abortion coverage from health insurance plans offered on the federal Affordable Care Act\u2019s marketplace; a measure by Rep. Jodie Laubenberg, R-Parker, that would require abortion facilities to display information on abortion consent, abuse, child support and adoption services; and a bill by Rep. Debbie Riddle, R-Tomball, that would require abortion facility staff to complete training on human trafficking.\n\nIn the upper chamber, where fewer abortion-related bills were filed, the Senate State Affairs Committee endorsed a measure by state Sen. Larry Taylor, R-Friendswood, that would prohibit abortion coverage in both private health insurance plans and those offered through the federal marketplace.\n\nThe full chamber also voted out a bill by Sen. Van Taylor, R-Plano, that would allow health and human services agencies to maintain information about \u201cadverse actions\u201d at abortion facilities.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased with the pro-life bills in the House and the Senate,\u201d said Joe Pojman, executive director of anti-abortion group Texas Alliance for Life. \u201cWe are on a path to have a very successful session from our point of view.\u201d\n\nWith several bills now on the move, Democratic state Rep. Jessica Farrar of Houston said abortion legislation may have been on a slower timeline so that it didn\u2019t \u201ctie up\u201d other legislative priorities, but she added that was only delaying the inevitable.\n\n\u201cI think they will continue to restrict [it] until no woman can access abortion,\u201d said Farrar, who chairs the Texas House Women\u2019s Health Caucus. \u201cWhat good is a right if you can\u2019t access it? And so they\u2019re just shutting any and every door.\u201d\n\nNew abortion restrictions would come two years after the Legislature passed one of the nation's strictest abortion laws, also known as House Bill 2, which has led to the closure of dozens of clinics in the state and could leave Texas with fewer than 10 clinics \u2014 all in major metropolitan areas \u2014 if the abortion law holds up against an ongoing legal challenge.\n\nBut some conservatives say far-reaching abortion measures have not been prioritized this time around.\n\n\u201cI think some of the legislators are frustrated because they felt like they hadn\u2019t been sure that there would be a time and a place to have these discussions on the floor,\u201d said Emily Horne, a lobbyist with Texas Right to Life. \u201cIt\u2019s been a slow session for us.\u201d\n\nAmong the anti-abortion bills that have yet to be considered in committee are two proposals by state Rep. Matt Schaefer, R-Tyler, that would tighten reporting requirements for abortion facilities and remove an exemption to the state\u2019s ban on abortions after 20 weeks of gestation for abortions based on severe fetal abnormalities.\n\nAfter waiting for a committee hearing, Schaefer attached his bills as amendments to legislation meant to streamline services at the state\u2019s public health agency, prompting a heated floor fight Thursday over abortion that eventually knocked the bill off the floor.\n\n\u201cWhen you can\u2019t get a hearing \u2026 then you take what\u2019s available and you use your privilege as a member of the House of Representatives and the rules that are available,\u201d Schaefer said.\n\nOn Friday, Schaefer\u2019s bill to revise reporting requirements for abortion facilities, requiring them to submit monthly reports \u2014 rather than annual reports \u2014 was scheduled for a Wednesday hearing in the House State Affairs Committee, though committee chairman Rep. Byron Cook, R-Corsicana, said he was already planning to take up the bill before Thursday's floor debate.\n\nSchaefer said he received blowback from senior members of the House but plans to continue pushing for the fetal abnormality ban, which has not been scheduled for a hearing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a priority for House leadership, and I think they would rather not have highly controversial issues dealt with,\u201d Schaefer said, adding that abortion legislation was also not part of the governor\u2019s legislative priorities that seemed to be driving the agenda. \u201cWhen the governor doesn\u2019t make it a priority, maybe others don\u2019t either.\u201d\n\nThe governor's office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nResponding to claims that the House was moving slowly on abortion legislation, Cook said the chamber is moving at a \u201cprudent pace.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the bills that are being voted out were bills that we anticipated would be voted out,\u201d Cook said.\n\nJason Embry, a spokesman for House Speaker Joe Straus, echoed that sentiment.\n\n\u201cHouse committees are voting out bills every day on a range of priorities, including education, budget transparency, transportation and pro-life issues,\u201d Embry said. \u201cMay is going to be very busy.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After months of little movement in the Texas Legislature on proposals to further restrict abortion, the pace is picking up as a flurry of bills moves to the House and Senate floors.", "parsely-title": "Abortion Bills Gaining Momentum in Legislature", "twitter": {"description": "After months of little movement in the Texas Legislature on proposals to further restrict abortion, the pace is picking up as a flurry of bills moves to the House and Senate floors.", "title": "Abortion Bills Gaining Momentum in Legislature", "url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2015/04/29/abortion-bills-gaining-momentum-legislature/", "image": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/2013/07/22/Protesters-Split_jpg_407x1000_q100.jpg", "creator": "@alexazura", "site": "@TexasTribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 154122474650943, "pages": 124434790836}, "og": {"site_name": "The Texas Tribune", "description": "After months of little movement in the Texas Legislature on proposals to further restrict abortion, the pace is picking up as a flurry of bills moves to the House and Senate floors.", "title": "Abortion Bills Gaining Momentum in Legislature", "url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2015/04/29/abortion-bills-gaining-momentum-legislature/", "image": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/2013/07/22/Protesters-Split_jpg_800x1000_q100.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "Reproductive Health,Abortion,Health", "parsely-author": "Alexa Ura", "parsely-section": "front-page", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/texastribune/"}, "parsely-pub-date": "April 29, 2015, 6 a.m.", "parsely-image-url": "https://static.texastribune.org/media/images/2013/07/22/Protesters-Split_jpg_407x1000_q100.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "parsely-link": "http://www.texastribune.org/2015/04/29/abortion-bills-gaining-momentum-legislature/"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3206\"", "article_summary": "Krause said he opted instead to work with state Rep.
