She even won praise from Greenpeace during her five years as environment minister.\n\nNow a poll predicts 56-year-old Silva will squeeze into the second round of voting and narrowly beat President Dilma Rousseff. It is the first time that Rousseff, 66, has been behind in the polls.\n\nThis could make Silva the first environmentalist to lead a major world economy. And what happens to the environment in Brazil, home to the planet\u2019s great green lungs, matters on a global scale.\n\nIt would also make her the first Afro-Brazilian president, in a country with a huge black population.\n\nSome believe Silva\u2019s lead won\u2019t last. But David Fleischer, a political science professor emeritus at the University of Brasilia, says that\u2019s \u201cjust a hypothesis.\u201d He points to how strongly she was polling in 2013 \u2014 until a court ruled in October she had insufficient signatures to register as a candidate for her new party. Then she joined Campos\u2019 Brazilian Socialist Party ticket.\n\n\u201cBefore she was ruled out as a candidate in her own right she was receiving 27 or 28 percent, and was looking like she would really rival Dilma. She has a real shot now,\u201d Fleischer says.\n\nWhat would it mean for Brazil\u2019s environmental policies?\n\nStop the dams\n\nGreen groups generally give Dilma Rousseff low scores. But nothing riles them quite like the multibillion-dollar mega-dams that she has pushed in the Amazon, flooding millions of acres of rain forest, displacing indigenous communities, and even causing a spike in carbon emissions.\n\nAs former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva\u2019s environment minister, Marina Silva opposed the dams. But if elected president, with broader responsibilities, freezing the hydroelectric projects would be a huge decision.\n\n\u201cIt would be very difficult, even if she is elected, to reverse that,\u201d Fleischer says. \u201cBrazil needs electricity and you would not want to be blamed, as [former Brazil President Fernando Henrique] Cardoso was, for causing blackouts.\u201d\n\nBut Sergio Abranches, a Rio-based environmental journalist and analyst, disagrees. \u201cYes, it is a very tough decision,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there is a simple way to solve the problem which is to close them. These dams are all in the red and she just needs to stop giving the consortia more money. Remember, there is a huge majority who reject the dams.\u201d\n\nPrioritize the Amazon\n\nAs environment minister, Silva launched several programs that slowed deforestation in the world\u2019s largest tropical rain forest. They included the Sustainable Amazon Plan and the Plan to Prevent and Control Deforestation in the Amazon.\n\nShe also increased resources for enforcement of environmental laws routinely flouted in remote corners of the jungle. The resulting plunge in deforestation rates even outstripped the simultaneous drop in commodity prices, whose highs some analysts had pinpointed as a major driver of the destruction.\n\nBut that changed once Rousseff \u2014 who as energy minister had frequently battled with Silva\u2019s Environment Ministry \u2014 took office as president in 2011. \u201cDuring Dilma\u2019s presidency all that effectively stopped,\u201d Abranches says. The result has been that the deforestation rates have spiked again.\n\nThat may not all be Rousseff\u2019s fault. The president actually fought hard to stop congress from relaxing the forest code. But were Silva to take her place, she could be expected to attempt to roll back those changes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marina Silva could become the first environmentalist to lead a major world economy.
