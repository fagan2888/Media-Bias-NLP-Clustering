Then a large majority of Democrats, eager to kill that negotiating power, joined a majority of Republicans to vote against the aid for workers.\n\nThe White House drew attention to the close passage of the trade negotiation piece and noted that the legislation had overcome similar difficulties in the Senate.\n\n\"I'm tempted to walk out here and say that it's deja vu all over again,\" presidential spokesman Josh Earnest said.\n\nBut Obama's struggles raised fresh questions about his ability to hold sway over members of his own party.\n\nHe made a surprise visit Thursday to watch lawmakers' annual charity baseball game. Obama brought a case of his White House beer for the winners\n\nHe made a rare trip to the Capitol to meet with House Democrats on Friday morning. Asked as he emerged if he had changed any minds, Obama replied, \"It's just a question if I changed votes.\"\n\nHe hadn't.\n\nRep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., a critic of the trade legislation, offered a blistering critique: \"He's ignored Congress and disrespected Congress for years and then he shows up at the baseball game with homemade beer, and then comes to the caucus and lectures us for 40 minutes about his values and whether or not we're being honest by using legislative tactics to try and stop something which we believe is a horrible mistake for the United States of America and questions our integrity.\"\n\nDeFazio added, \"It wasn't the greatest strategy.\"\n\nAt issue in the health care case before the Supreme Court case is whether Congress authorized federal subsidy payments for health care coverage regardless of where people live, or only for residents of states that created their own insurance marketplaces. Nearly 6.4 million low- and moderate-income people could lose coverage if the court rules those enrolled through the federal site aren't eligible for the subsidies.\n\nObama says the 5-year-old law is well established and that the case against it is so flimsy that the court should not even have considered it.\n\n\"This is now part of the fabric of how we care for one another,\" he said this past week.\n\nOn Iran, negotiators from the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China and Iran face a month's end deadline to finalize a deal aimed at curbing Tehran's ability to build a nuclear bomb.\n\nIran denies any nuclear weapon ambitions and says its nuclear program is meant for power and other peaceful purposes.\n\nObama has already come under criticism from some U.S. allies in the Middle East and members of Congress who say the administration has conceded too much.\n\nBut the talks provided the White House with an opportunity Friday to suggest that relations with House Democrats aren't as sour as the trade vote might suggest.\n\nSpokesman Earnest noted that nearly every House Democrat signed a letter last month voicing support for Obama's efforts to complete a deal with Iran.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Together they symbolize the totality of the president's achievements in domestic, economic and national security policies.", "title": "Obama's big trade setback is an ominous sign", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/obamas-legacy-is-on-the-line-this-month-and-its-not-going-well-so-far-2015-6", "image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/557c0d61ecad04a32b4452ac-506-253/obamas-big-trade-setback-is-an-ominous-sign.jpg", "site": "bi_contributors", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "politics-contributor,main-contributor,politics,clusterstock", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Associated Press, Obama, Trans-Pacific Partnership, JIM KUHNHENN", "description": "Together they symbolize the totality of the president's achievements in domestic, economic and national security policies.", "author": "JIM KUHNHENN, Associated Press", "sailthru.date": "2015-06-14", "sailthru.title": "Obama's big trade setback is an ominous sign", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/557c0d6f6da811df6b4b2209-50-50/obamas-big-trade-setback-is-an-ominous-sign.jpg", "news_keywords": "Associated Press, Obama, Trans-Pacific Partnership, JIM KUHNHENN", "tbi-image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/557c0d6f6da811df6b4b2209/obamas-big-trade-setback-is-an-ominous-sign.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-06-14", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "sailthru.description": "Together they symbolize the totality of the president's achievements in domestic, economic and national security policies.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Together they symbolize the totality of the president's achievements in domestic, economic and national security policies.", "title": "Obama's big trade setback is an ominous sign", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/obamas-legacy-is-on-the-line-this-month-and-its-not-going-well-so-far-2015-6", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/557c0d61ecad04a32b4452ac-1190-625/obamas-big-trade-setback-is-an-ominous-sign.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Obama's big trade setback is an ominous sign", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/557c0d6f6da811df6b4b2209/obamas-big-trade-setback-is-an-ominous-sign.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "politics-contributor"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcfad\"", "article_summary": "But the talks provided the White House with an opportunity Friday to suggest that relations with House Democrats aren't as sour as the trade vote might suggest.\nThe trade defeat in Congress was an ominous sign in a month of challenges that could help determine President Barack Obama's standing for the rest of his second term.\nThe White House drew attention to the close passage of the trade negotiation piece and noted that the legislation had overcome similar difficulties in the Senate.\nObama brought a case of his White House beer for the winnersHe made a rare trip to the Capitol to meet with House Democrats on Friday morning.\nFellow Democrats rebuffed last-minute appeals to rescue his global trade agenda, and the House seriously damaged Obama's chances of capping his presidency with a groundbreaking economic pact involving Pacific Rim countries."}
