FORT COLLINS — The word of the day for Colorado State is “contain.”

During Saturday afternoon’s conference game between Colorado State (4-5, 2-2 Mountain West) and Nevada (3-6, 2-4) in Hughes Stadium, the first order of business for the CSU defense will be in containing Wolf Pack quarterback Cody Fajardo and preventing the savvy junior from breaking free from the pocket.

Operating out of Nevada’s signature pistol offense, Fajardo, a 6-foot-2, 210-pounder, is a classic dual-threat quarterback that can put stress on the opposition with his arm and his legs.

Fajardo has thrown only two interceptions all season, and his career completion percentage of 67.7 ranks sixth nationally among current players.

On the ground, Fajardo has netted 411 yards and scored five touchdowns this season , with a long gain of 47 yards.

“He’s a really good quarterback,” CSU safety Trent Matthews said. “You have to keep an eye on a guy like that.”

Colorado State’s secondary may have a different look Saturday. Reserve safeties Jasen Oden and Jake Schlager are expected to get more snaps with two usual starters, safety Kevin Pierre-Louis (ankle) and cornerback Bernard Blake (toe), banged up.

That’s a scary thought, considering that CSU ranks 120th nationally in pass defense. The Rams secondary has particularly been burned when quarterbacks leave the pocket and then pull up and throw.

On the other hand, CSU fans — and perhaps coaches — may be ready to see what the sophomore Oden and true-freshman Schlager can do.

Colorado State, which should move the ball offensively, is a touchdown favorite. But any advantage for the Rams becomes reduced — or eliminated — Fajardo has a big game.
