No one was injured, but the building was hurt pretty badly. Harlan Davis says his great-grandfather opened this building as a store in 1905. Since then, it's operated as a commissary and now as a storage facility. He says it's hard to believe the building survived through many storms and hurricanes only to be taken out 110 years later by a car.\n\n\"I've thought about lightning a lot striking it. And possibly a tornado. It's occurred to me that this could happen, a car could hit it. That has entered my mind, but I didn't really think it would happen,\" Davis says.\n\nDavis says he's not sure yet whether they will try to repair the old store.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A car lost control and hit a building from the early 1900s.", "language": "english", "author": "Candace Barnette", "og": {"description": "A car lost control and hit a building from the early 1900s.", "title": "Car Hits 110-Year-Old Building", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Car-Hits-110-Year-Old-Building-299519071.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/204/6AF/2046AF99C2FA4900BC7EE8609DBD69F4", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/8B8/11A/8B811AAB5220455EA74BA9EE8D9B80AD.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "A car lost control and hit a building from the early 1900s.", "title": "Car Hits 110-Year-Old Building", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Car-Hits-110-Year-Old-Building-299519071.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/car+hit+building.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Car Hits 110-Year-Old Building", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9476\"", "article_summary": "got a call that a driver lost control of his car and crashed into a building on Russell Topton Road.\nA car crashed into a piece of history in Toomsuba.\nThat has entered my mind, but I didn't really think it would happen,\" Davis says.\nHe says it's hard to believe the building survived through many storms and hurricanes only to be taken out 110 years later by a car.\nIt's occurred to me that this could happen, a car could hit it."}
