GORDON\n\nLos Alamos Daily Post\n\nMore than 3,000 New Mexicans felt the Bern Friday during a campaign rally at Santa Fe Community College.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders took time before his speech in the SFCC Fitness Education Center to address some 600 people in the parking lot who could not get into the packed facility.\n\n\u201cNew Mexico is ready for a political revolution,\u201d Sanders told the crowd. \u201cOur job is to build an economy, which works for everybody.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 1.5 hour speech inside the gym was broadcast via loudspeakers to the crowd outside.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to win a lot more states and millions more votes,\u201d Sanders promised his supporters. He urged them to promote a large turnout in New Mexico.\n\n\u201cWe will fight for every last vote between now and June 14,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe establishment indicated who the candidate would be before the process began,\u201d Sanders said, pointing out that more than 400 delegates indicated support for his rival, Hillary Clinton before anyone else was in the race.\n\n\u201cIf this is the process, you might not end up with someone who can beat a candidate like Donald Trump,\u201d he said, pointing to polls that show Sanders has a better chance to beat Trump than Clinton.\n\nSanders attacked the role of money in modern politics, declaring \u201cwhen you have billionaires supporting other billionaires, that isn\u2019t democracy, that\u2019s oligarchy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny objective observer will tell you the energy and excitement is in our campaign, not Secretary Clinton\u2019s,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nSanders hammered home his message that inequities in the American economic system are undermining democracy, noting that 58 percent of newly generated income goes to the richest 1 percent of citizens. Sanders promised the wealthy will start paying their fair share of taxes if he is elected president.\n\nHe noted that at 30 percent, New Mexico has the highest rate of childhood poverty in the country.\n\n\u201cThat should not happen in New Mexico. It must not happen in America. We\u2019re going to change our national priorities,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders said the rate of incarceration, the highest in the world, is an \u201cinternational embarrassment.\n\n\u201cI want this country to have the best educated population in the world \u2013 not the most people in jail,\u201d he said.\n\nHe promised to address the crisis of drug addiction as a health issue, not a criminal issue.\n\n\u201cWe need a revolution in how we do mental health in this country,\u201d he continued. \u201cPeople who are suicidal or homicidal cannot get the treatment they need.\u201d\n\nSanders reached out to his young supporters. Voters under 45 have supported Sanders by large margins during the primary.\n\n\u201cYoung people are the future and they want to be involved in shaping it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe reiterated one of his major campaign planks, that public colleges and universities should be tuition-free.\n\n\u201cNew Mexico has the worst high school graduation rate in the country. I want to tell every student they can get an education no matter what their economic status.\u201d he said.\n\nSanders reached out to the Latino community, promising to work to end the exploitation of the 11 million people living in the country illegally and to create a \u201cfast forward to citizenship.\u201d\n\nHe also promised African Americans that he would provide funds for the inner cities. In a message to Native Americans, Sanders said that Native Americans have given \u201cus and our culture so much that the debt to them is unpayable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will change our relationship to the Native American people. We will respect sovereign rights,\u201d he said.\n\nSanders spent a good portion of his time on health care.\n\n\u201cHow does every major country on earth except the United States guarantee health care to all their people,\u201d Sanders asked. \u201cI believe that health care is a right.\u201d\n\nHe praised the Affordable Healthcare Act, but pointed out there\u2019s a long way to go when 29 million Americans have no insurance and many more have such high deductibles and co-payments that they cannot see a doctor or afford prescription medicine.\n\nIn his blunt spoken manner, Sanders said he \u201cdespises\u201d the pharmaceutical companies the six largest of which pulled in 50 billion in profit while charging huge amounts for their drugs. \u201cWe will tell them they are going to stop ripping off the people of this country,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nSanders put forward the populist message that \u201creal change happens from the bottom up.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the union movement and thanked them for \u201cgiving us the modern middle class.\u201d He also pointed to the gains made by the civil rights movement, the feminist movement and the gay movement through grassroots action.\n\n\u201cThe only way we can bring about change is when we all stand up together,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWhen we do that, there is nothing, nothing, nothing that can stop us.\u201d\n\nFollowing his Santa Fe rally, Sanders visited Albuquerque where more than 7,000 turned out to hear him speak while hundreds more were turned away. He then headed to a gathering in Las Cruces where he completed his New Mexico campaign sweep.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ladailypost.com/content/bernie-sanders-brings-populist-message-santa-fe", "site_name": "Los Alamos Daily Post", "type": "article", "title": "Bernie Sanders Brings Populist Message To Santa Fe"}, "copyright": "(c) 2013 Los Alamos Daily Post.
