That is the best way I believe at this moment for us to express our disapproval.\u201d\n\nUltimately, House leadership worked out a tenuous compromise where members will cast a series of votes related to the Iran compact, including a resolution of approval. The proposal is sure to fail but the move is designed to force Democrats to abandon the White House and deliver another political embarrassment to President Obama.\n\nStill, the intraparty warfare doesn\u2019t bode well for lawmakers to pass a bill to fund the government by October 1 and prevent a shutdown.\n\nRelated: How Congress Deals with This To-Do List Impacts Everything\n\nEarlier Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) dismissed a question about when he would bring up a \u201cclean\u201d continuing resolution to keep the government running.\n\n\u201cI have not made any decisions on when we would move the CR,\u201d he said during a press conference following a meeting of all Republican members, referring to the continuing resolution.\n\nUnlike the bewildering debate over how to proceed on the Iran deal, the GOP split over spending has been building for a while.\n\nConservatives want any funding bill to cut off millions in federal dollars for Planned Parenthood after hidden camera videos showed organization officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue. On Tuesday a sizeable group of rank-and-file members said they wouldn\u2019t back any spending bill that contains money for Planned Parenthood.\n\nRelated: Trump Calls Iran Deal Incompetent as Khamenei Calls for Israel\u2019s Demise\n\nYet GOP leaders and other senior Republicans, like House Appropriations Committee chair Hal Rogers (R-KY), have shown no appetite for forcing another government shutdown.\n\nBoehner\u2019s speakership could be on the line, with members of the sizeable House Freedom Caucus signaling that they are waiting to see how leaders handle their concerns before possibly launching a coup for the gavel.\n\nLeadership hopes to mollify them and others by holding a series of listening sessions for members to air their grievances about the spending impasse and propose solutions.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats contend now is the time for Republicans to finally sit down at the negotiating table and work out a compromise spending bill as well as the other fiscal matters on the horizon.\n\nRelated: White House Takes Aim at Billions in Medicare and Medicaid Fraud\n\n\u201cOn any CR, we have to make sure it\u2019s at the right length. We know we\u2019re going to have to have a short CR, but it should be short enough that we don\u2019t have to keep coming back for debt ceiling, tax extenders. We should do it all at once,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) told reporters. \u201cWe need to make sure that there is something in the way of a negotiation. It\u2019s not going to happen just because they want it to happen.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have long objected to a maneuver contained in the GOP budget blueprint that funneled an additional $38 billion into the Defense Department\u2019s war fund that would allow the agency to skirt budget caps. They want a deal that would lift the caps across the federal government, not just for the Pentagon.\n\n\u201cA perfect storm is out there brewing,\u201d according to Reid. \u201cI talked to [Treasury Secretary] Jack Lew a week ago. He doesn\u2019t know how long the government has money left to continue paying its bills. It\u2019s not a real long time. He said after the receipts come in for September, he\u2019ll have a better idea, but that\u2019s a ways from now.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he had been contacted by Republicans about such talks, Reid replied: \u201cWe\u2019ve heard nothing, zero.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Republican-controlled Congress has been back from August recess for one full day and lawmakers already seemed overwhelmed by the slate of problems they left unresolved before adjourning.", "title": "A \u2018Perfect Storm\u2019 Is Brewing as the Budget Battle Looms", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/10/Perfect-Storm-Brewing-Budget-Battle-Looms", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07102013_Congress_Clouds_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/10/Perfect-Storm-Brewing-Budget-Battle-Looms", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07102013_Congress_Clouds_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Republican-controlled Congress has been back from August recess for one full day and lawmakers already seemed overwhelmed by the slate of problems they left unresolved before adjourning.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "On Tuesday a sizeable group of rank-and-file members said they wouldn\u2019t back any spending bill that contains money for Planned Parenthood.\nUnlike the bewildering debate over how to proceed on the Iran deal, the GOP split over spending has been building for a while.\n\u201cA perfect storm is out there brewing,\u201d according to Reid.\nBut House Republicans have revolted against the leadership\u2019s plan, arguing the agreement\u2019s 60-day congressional review period hasn\u2019t started yet because the Obama administration hasn\u2019t shared the details of so-called \u201cside deals\u201d between Tehran and the International Atomic Energy Agency.\nThey want a deal that would lift the caps across the federal government, not just for the Pentagon."}
