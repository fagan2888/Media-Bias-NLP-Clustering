This mandate also means they must get ready for some pretty unlikely scenarios.\n\nFrom wars in space to aliens, here are five of the Pentagon\u2019s strangest plans.\n\nRelated: Iranian Caught Stealing Plans for DOD's $1.5 Trillion Jet\n\nZombies - A new document shows that the Pentagon has plans to respond to an attack by zombies. DOD goes as far as to classify different kinds of zombies, from vegetarians to zombies from outer space.\n\nThe Pentagon said that the plans are fake and are meant as a thought experiment, as well as entertainment for soldiers. But just in case there\u2019s a zombie apocalypse, DOD will be ready.\n\nStar Wars - During the Cold War, both the Soviet Union and the United States had plans for space warfare. Both sides developed (or attempted to develop) missiles that could function in space, electronic equipment to cut off space communication, and lasers that could take out targets from space.\n\nThankfully the war in space, just like the war on earth, remained cold. There have only been a few instances of weapons ever being used in space, and in each, they were used to take down redundant satellites.\n\nRelated: DOD Is Stuck with a Flawed $1.5 Trillion Fighter Jet\n\nAliens - The Pentagon has been toying with plans for an alien invasion for decades. From 1947 to 1969, the Air Force formally studied unidentified flying objects.\n\nRonald Reagan was reportedly obsessed with aliens. He puzzled the world when he addressed the United Nations in 1987, raising the possibility of first contact with aliens.\n\n\u201cI occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world,\u201d Reagan said.\n\nAccording to Professor Paul Springer from the U.S. Air Command and Staff College, plans to combat an alien invasion are ongoing. In 2012, he told an Australian television show that he had been ordered to draw up plans in case aliens tried to take Earth.\n\nRelated: F-35 Plagued with Even More Problems\n\nInvading Canada - Most Americans view Canada as a friendly, benevolent neighbor to the north. However, in the 1920s and 1930s, this was not the case.\n\nWar Plan Red assumed that Great Britain would try to invade the United States through Canada. Military planners drew up sophisticated strategies for how to repel this invasion and then occupy parts of Canada.\n\nThe Gay Bomb - In 1994, strategist at Wright Laboratory in Ohio devised a hypothetical non-lethal chemical weapon that would make soldiers gay. The weapon would contain pheromones that would make soldiers of the same sex attracted to one another.\n\nFor their work, in 2007 Harvard University awarded them the Ig Nobel Prize, a parody of the Nobel Prize, for \u201cinstigating research and development on a chemical weapon \u2026that will make enemy soldiers become sexually irresistible to each other.\u201d The researchers declined to accept the award in person.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "DOD has to plan for everything.
