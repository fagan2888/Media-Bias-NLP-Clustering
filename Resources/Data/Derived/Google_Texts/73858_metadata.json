The Toronto Star reported that it is a \u201chot fashion item\u201d in the Ontario First Nations community.\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s reaction has been all positive and they see the humour in it both on and off the reserve,\u201d Tracy Bomberry, Six Nations of the the Grand River, told the Star.\n\nHer inspiration to wear the shirt came after learning that Ojibwa singer Ian Campeau, aka, DJ NDN of A Tribe Called Red was accused of being a \u201cracist hypocrite\u201d for wearing one, the paper said.\n\nAccording to MetroNews.Ca, an email was sent anonymously to Westfest, a popular music festival in Ottawa, Canada, where Tribe Called Red was scheduled to perform. The individual who sent the email threatened to boycott the concert because Campeau was spotted wearing the T-shirt.\n\n\u201cI thought how hypocritical that he would be accused of racism for wearing a shirt that turns the tables in a satirical way of how our image as native people has been misappropriated by the Cleveland Indians, Washington Redskins and the like,\u201d Bomberry said.\n\nCampeau, his band, and staff members of the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), including First Nations Chief, Shawn Atleo, filed a lawsuit to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario claiming that the Amateaur football team, the Nepean Redskins, use of the R-word was racially discriminatory, and sought to quell its use. The tribunal dismissed the complaint in March, but the team changed its name to the Nepean Eagles.\n\nBrian Kirby of Shelf Life Clothing in Cleveland said that the interest in the T-shirt \u201cskyrocketed\u201d after the Campeau controversy. \"We have been selling a modest amount of shirts to Canada for years ... but nothing like the volume of the last month,\" Kirby told QMI Agency in an email interview Tuesday. \"We are a mom and pop business, working day and night to make sure everyone who wants a shirt gets one.\"\n\nRELATED: Cleveland Indians Slowly Phasing out Chief Wahoo\n\nKirby noticed the cultural effect of the Chief Wahoo logo in the Native community after moving to Cleveland from New York. He said that the overall interpretation of the shirt shifts. \u201cInterpretation of the shirt ranges from a \u2018reverse racism,\u2019 \u2018see how YOU like it\u2019 intent, to a \u2018see, I\u2019m white and it doesn't bother me to be caricatured!\u2019 attitude,\u201d Kirby told the Star.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cCaucasians\u201d T-shirt That Mocks Cleveland Indians\u2019 Wahoo a Best-Seller", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/04/caucasians-t-shirt-mocks-cleveland-indians-wahoo-best-seller-156210", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/t-shirt_logo.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "\u201cCaucasians\u201d T-shirt That Mocks Cleveland Indians\u2019 Wahoo a Best-Seller"}, "abstract": "\u201cCaucasians\u201d T-shirt That Mocks Cleveland Indians\u2019 Wahoo a Best-Seller", "dc": {"title": "\u201cCaucasians\u201d T-shirt That Mocks Cleveland Indians\u2019 Wahoo a Best-Seller"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/04/caucasians-t-shirt-mocks-cleveland-indians-wahoo-best-seller-156210", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Chief Wahoo,the Nepean Eagles, Redskins, Cleveland Indians, Six Nations of the the Grand River,  DJ NDN, A Tribe Called Red,", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2014-08-04T11:55-04:00", "dcterms.title": "\u201cCaucasians\u201d T-shirt That Mocks Cleveland Indians\u2019 Wahoo a Best-Seller"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf2c3\"", "article_summary": "RELATED: Cleveland Indians Slowly Phasing out Chief WahooKirby noticed the cultural effect of the Chief Wahoo logo in the Native community after moving to Cleveland from New York.\nThe words \u201cCaucasians\u201d with the image of a grinning caricature (reminiscent of the Indians\u2019 Chief Wahoo) across the front hints at how offensive Native mascots on professional sports teams can be.\nBrian Kirby of Shelf Life Clothing in Cleveland said that the interest in the T-shirt \u201cskyrocketed\u201d after the Campeau controversy.\nThe individual who sent the email threatened to boycott the concert because Campeau was spotted wearing the T-shirt.\nA new sports-logo T-shirt has become a hot seller in Canada and parts of the United States."}
