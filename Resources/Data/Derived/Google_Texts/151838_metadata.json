The latest column, showing the dismay of Texas lawmakers about this quietly-launched program is here.\n\nBut as a supplement to my columns (there have now been four), I also like to present the actual comments from various parties so you can decide for yourself.\n\nBackground: I exposed this program of fingerprinting all Texas driver\u2019s license applicants. DPS defends it as legal under a 2005 state law. Some state lawmakers say that\u2019s not what they voted on.\n\nIn this installment of What the Players Actually Say (read a previous one here), I share the detailed memo that DPS is sending to state legislators who inquire about the program.\n\nHere is the DPS memo in full. (This opens into Scribd where we have uploaded it for you.) It\u2019s eye-opening with the most information DPS has provided to the public about this. Unfortunately, this was not provided to the public. It was sent to lawmakers but was not provided to the press.\n\nAnd below I have the response to that memo from Ryan Barrett, the fingerprint tech who resigned, in part, because he believes, as others do, that the quietly-launched program is illegal, unethical and unathorized by state lawmakers.\n\nRyan Barrett\u2019s response:\n\nI am noticing in these documents that the PR team I suppose that is trying to handle/respond to everything still doesn\u2019t see that AFIS isn\u2019t the only issue \u2013 the crimes & records department maintains a record after it runs through AFIS.\n\nAlso, while they maintain that they aren\u2019t searching an individual\u2019s criminal history, it is important to note the database (which is split into AFIS and CCH) that the crimes & records department houses is, by its very nature, a criminal history database. CCH stands for Computerized Criminal History! Therefore, by using AFIS to identify a record with fingerprints (which is the point of AFIS), they are indeed searching for someone\u2019s criminal history, because that\u2019s the point of the database. Concealed handgun licenses require a criminal background check \u2013 therefore they are run through AFIS and stored in the department. Same goes for the national guard, teachers, realtors, etc.\n\nGenerally, there are two cases AFIS and CCH is used for:\n\n1) A licensing agency wants to know the criminal background of an applicant because it\u2019s required by state law \u2013 therefore they submit the applicant\u2019s prints to AFIS, which gives them a record number of the applicant, which is then used to look-up their criminal (and licensing) history in CCH.\n\n2) A Texas police agency wants to submit an arrest \u2013 therefore they submit the arrested person\u2019s prints with the arrest data to AFIS, which gives the police agency back a record number of the individual arrested, which allows them to see their criminal (or licensing) history in CCH.\n\nIn either case, the submitted information is retained in both AFIS (fingerprints) and CCH (license or arrest information). So what happens if you don\u2019t have a record in case #1 or #2? A new one is instantly created and stored in the system.Driver\u2019s licenses are now part of case #1. Does the DL department care about your criminal history? No \u2013 excluding citations and DUI\u2019s.\n\nBut what effectively happens is that the Department of Public Safety\u2019s law enforcement side gets to have and use practically every individual\u2019s fingerprints in the state for purposes other than licensing. The separation is gone. Think about this for a second: when you renew or obtain a new driver\u2019s license as of January 2014, your prints and that record are also stored in the DPS\u2019s Crimes & Records department.\n\nOne secondary positive effect of using AFIS is ensuring unique records \u2013 i.e., there are no duplicate records, and every record reflects a unique individual. That\u2019s what the DPS is trying to take advantage of by sending drivers license fingerprints through the system. I\u2019m all for that, but it needs to be separate \u2013 drivers licensing needs its own system that houses and contains only DL fingerprints. Additionally, we need a clear definition of what constitutes using our fingerprints.\n\nWe have definitions for arrests and licensing agencies that require criminal history checks. But not with drivers licenses.Are drivers licenses at the same level as a concealed handgun license? Regardless of the answer, there needs to be concrete legislation AND policies/procedures that define these topics.\n\nMost importantly, the public needs to be able to know what\u2019s going on with their private information. Had Dave\u2019s articles not been in the media, how would anyone have known what was happening? How would anyone have had the chance to debate this topic?\n\n- end of Ryan Barrett\n\nRead the original Watchdog column about fingerprinting here\n\nRead the column in which The Watchdog introduces the whistblower here\n\nRead how DPS is temporarily halting the processing here", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzA4L3RleGFzLWRwcy13aGlzdGxlYmxvd2VyLWluc2lzdHMtb2ZmaWNpYWxzLWFyZW50LWJlaW5nLWNhbmRpZC5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Dave Lieber", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "The whistleblower who worked in the Texas Department of Public Safety fingerprint processing division insists that top officials at DPS are not being candid with state legislators who complain about\u2026", "title": "Texas DPS whistleblower insists officials aren\u2019t being candid", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2014/08/texas-dps-whistleblower-insists-officials-arent-being-candid.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/files/2014/08/fingerprint-picture.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-08-03T10:07:23Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "article_summary": "The whistleblower who worked in the Texas Department of Public Safety fingerprint processing division insists that top officials at DPS are not being candid with state legislators who complain about DPS\u2019 new plan to fingerprint all Texas drivers.\nBackground: I exposed this program of fingerprinting all Texas driver\u2019s license applicants.\nI\u2019m all for that, but it needs to be separate \u2013 drivers licensing needs its own system that houses and contains only DL fingerprints.\nCCH stands for Computerized Criminal History!\nWe have definitions for arrests and licensing agencies that require criminal history checks."}
