Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, it is the largest federal grant program available to undergraduate students, awarding almost 10 million students with debt-free financial aid annually. (The Minnesota Office of Higher Education, \u201cPaying for College,\u201d 2014)\n\nThe recently proposed House Republican budget resolution for the 2015-2016 fiscal year, entitled \u201cA Balanced Budget for a Stronger America,\u201d in addition to repealing the Affordable Care Act and cutting other social safety net programs, would freeze funding to Pell Grants at their current maximum award amount, $5,775, for the next 10 years.\n\nThe House\u2019s recent budget report read, \u201cAfter multiple increases to Pell Grant award levels, the program is now facing a shortfall. In the past, lawmakers have dealt with the problem with short-term funding patches. Our budget rejects these temporary measures and makes the Pell Grant program permanently sustainable so that it is able to serve students today and in the future,\u201d (House of Representatives Committee on the Budget, \u201cA Balanced Budget for a Stronger America.\u201d)\n\nThis proposal comes in the wake of last year\u2019s attempt to do similarly. \u201c[Congress is] demanding Washington live within its means,\u201d remarked House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price (R-GA), the overseer of this year\u2019s plan. (The Washington Post, \u201cGOP budget plan has a surprise among list of cuts for federal employees,\u201d 03.29.15)\n\nDespite assertions that the plan rightly addresses an imminent funding shortfall in the 2016 fiscal year, the DCCC\u2019s upcoming attacks have garnered strong support from left-leaning student organizations, like the College Democrats of New York (CDNY), who commended the campaign in a recent press release.\n\nThe DCCC\u2019s advertisements in New York will target Rep. John Katko of the 24th congressional district, where Syracuse University is, and Rep. Lee Zeldin of the 1st congressional district, where the State University of New York (SUNY) at Stony Brook is.\n\nAccording to a CDNY press release, although last year SUNY Stony Brook\u2019s in-state tuition costed $4,215 and its out-of-state tuition costed $10,925, which themselves do not include the additional costs of housing, meal plans, academic supplies and other basic living supplies, the school\u2019s average Pell Grant was only about $3,000.\n\nCDNY Vice President and senior at SUNY Stony Brook Kevin Gomez commented, \u201cPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to attend Stony Brook without the Pell Grant. I have taken out the max amount of loans that the government has allowed and I still have to pay out of pocket on top of that. I work shifts at a restaurant to pay for those costs. This is at a public school where tuition is supposed to be affordable; I can only imagine the cost incurred by students at private universities.\u201d\n\nAlthough the DCCC advertisements in New York will be aimed specifically at Katko and Zeldin, the CDNY has encouraged criticism of any New Yorkers in Congress who have opposed Pell Grants. \u201cEvery year, tuition at universities around New York rise, and a Pell Grant freeze would hurt every student,\u201d the CDNY Executive Board remarked. \u201cOther New York Republican representatives Elise Stefanik (R-NY21) and Tom Reed (R-NY23) have also voted against Pell Grants, and their districts encompass both private and public universities such as Cornell University, Ithaca College, Elmira College, SUNY Plattsburgh, St. Lawrence University, and SUNY Potsdam.\u201d\n\nAccording to a recent study made by The Upshot and published in The New York Times, approximately 25 percent of Vassar students currently qualify for Pell Grants, one of the highest numbers in the country. (The New York Times, \u201cTop Colleges That Enroll Rich, Middle Class and Poor,\u201d 09.08.14) Although the DCCC advertisements will not appear in any Vassar publications, many hope that their efforts will still resonate with students on campus, for many of whom Pell Grants are foundational to their ability to pay for their education.\n\nVassar Democrats President Seth Bynum \u201915 commented in an emailed statement, \u201cFinancial aid is not only a Vassar, but it is an \u2018every college\u2019 issue. Millions of students around the country are taking the time and spending the money to better themselves and receive an education. We as young people are taught that education is the silver pill in regards to improving ones financial standing in life as well as improving the world we live in. The current Republican budget disregards this fact to save a few billion dollars over the next 10 years. Republicans pride themselves in being the party that doesn\u2019t give handouts and encourages people to \u201clift themselves up by their bootstraps.\u2019 A student who receives a Pell Grant is not given a free pass afterwards, they still must earn high marks through hard work and determination and graduate from college.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Republican budget plan has passed in the House, the Senate and the Executive branch will soon have the chance to weigh in, after which the future of the Pell Grant may become more clear.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This week, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) will begin an advertising campaign targeting 15 Republican members of the House of Representatives who have voted for the recent House Republican budget proposal, which would freeze funds to the Pell Grant award for 10 years.", "generator": "WordPress 4.0.11", "og": {"site_name": "The Miscellany News", "description": "This week, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) will begin an advertising campaign targeting 15 Republican members of the House of Representatives who have voted for the recent House Republican budget proposal, which would freeze funds to the Pell Grant award for 10 years.", "title": "Republican budget proposal seeks to freeze Pell Grant", "url": "http://miscellanynews.org/2015/04/01/news/republican-budget-proposal-seeks-to-freeze-pell-grant/", "image": {"width": 2048, "identifier": "http://miscellanynews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/16788528007_5bde7ff781_k.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 1365}, "updated_time": "2015-04-01T20:10:39+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://miscellanynews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/16788528007_5bde7ff781_k.jpg", "height": 1365, "width": 2048}, "description": "This week, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) will begin an advertising campaign targeting 15 Republican members of the House of Representatives who have voted for the recent House Republican budget proposal, which would freeze funds to the Pell Grant award for 10 years.", "card": "summary", "title": "Republican budget proposal seeks to freeze Pell Grant"}, "keywords": "news, gop, pell grant, republican", "article": {"publisher": "http://miscellanynews.org/", "published_time": "2015-04-01T17:01:27+00:00", "author": "http://miscellanynews.org/author/kevinqiu/", "section": "NEWS", "modified_time": "2015-04-01T20:10:39+00:00", "tag": "republican"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5a07\"", "article_summary": "The current Republican budget disregards this fact to save a few billion dollars over the next 10 years.\nThe House\u2019s recent budget report read, \u201cAfter multiple increases to Pell Grant award levels, the program is now facing a shortfall.\nThis week, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) will begin an advertising campaign targeting 15 Republican members of the House of Representatives who have voted for the recent House Republican budget proposal, which would freeze funds to the Pell Grant award for 10 years.\n\u201cEvery year, tuition at universities around New York rise, and a Pell Grant freeze would hurt every student,\u201d the CDNY Executive Board remarked.\n\u201c[Congress is] demanding Washington live within its means,\u201d remarked House Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price (R-GA), the overseer of this year\u2019s plan."}
