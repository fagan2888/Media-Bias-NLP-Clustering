Domains that got multiple requests will get put into an online auction and go to the applicant who makes the highest bid.\n\nWhen the reservations are all sorted and the application process is over, New Yorkers will be able to purchase the domain name through the typical fashion, checking to see if it is available and then purchasing it if it is.\n\nFor businesses that are located in New York, this could be a good branding opportunity.\n\nA 2013 survey by Wakefield Research showed that 49% of small business owners were not completely satisfied with their current domain name. Fifty-five percent of the survey respondents believed that they lost business because of settling on an inferior domain name.\n\nSince having a strong domain name can help with search engine optimization and marketing efforts, this could be a good opportunity for New York entrepreneurs to consider while writing their business plans.\n\nIn a press release on Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that offering \u201c.nyc\u201d domain names to New Yorkers can help expand the city\u2019s place on the \u201cdigital map.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe new .nyc domain presents a unique opportunity for New Yorkers, our small businesses, and organizations throughout the five boroughs to brand their identity, showcase their affiliation with the City\u2014and to \u2018own\u2019 who they are online,\u201d de Blasio said in the press release.\n\nGet Free Updates!
