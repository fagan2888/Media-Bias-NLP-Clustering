Mike Blake/Reuters\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that she would expand on President Barack Obama\u2018s executive actions on immigration\u2014making a play to bind immigrant voting blocs to the Democratic Party.\n\nConservative Republicans can do much better than Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposal to expand eligibility to defer deportation.\n\nThere is latent but broad support among most leading House and Senate Republicans, as well as the GOP presidential candidates\u2013underpinned by evangelicals\u2013to offer citizenship to people who were illegally brought to the United States as children.\n\nMrs. Clinton understands that the GOP is divided on many immigration issues and that even those legislators in \u201csafe\u201d seats can face primary threats if they are perceived to be \u201cpro-amnesty.\u201d Meanwhile, U.S. demographic trends and past Republican performance make clear that the GOP must win 30% of non-white voters to be competitive in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell might consider immediately moving to pass a bill offering citizenship to \u201cDREAMers.\u201d Chief opponents of such an effort are likely to be Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Tex.), Sen. Jeff Sessions (R., Ala.), Rep. Steve King (R., Iowa), and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R). But most in the GOP see the shortsightedness of reflexively crying \u201cNo amnesty!\u201d whether the issue is H-1B visas, farm workers, or young people brought here illegally as children.\n\nMany on Capitol Hill believe immigration reform should be a piecemeal process, with border security addressed first. A large bloc of conservative voters believe that any reform must first deter the flow of future illegal immigrants. Mrs. Clinton is baiting these conservatives, who understand the importance of deterrence and citizenship for DREAMers, with a proposal that could embolden an0ther generation of immigrants to risk illegally crossing our border.\n\nImmediate GOP progress to grant DREAMers citizenship would send a strong, compelling message: Not only would children have the safe harbor of citizenship, but their parents and broader communities would appreciate the relief such an opportunity offers.\n\nMrs. Clinton said that legal status is code for \u201csecond-class citizenship.\u201d For those who came here illegally through no fault of their own, second-class citizenship is effectively all President Obama has offered during his six years in the White House. Republicans may have other divides on immigration, but their majorities in the House and Senate should allow them to pass a narrow bill granting citizenship to DREAMers, transforming the lives of millions of immigrant children and their families and making a clear outreach to Hispanics, Latinos, Asians and Africans\u2014important demographics in 2016.\n\nJuleanna Glover is a corporate consultant and Republican policy and communications adviser who has served on the staffs of George W.
