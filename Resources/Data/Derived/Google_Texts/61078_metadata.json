While all legal U.S. residents will be allowed to purchase health insurance, subsidies will be available for those making up to 400% of the federal poverty level, which is about $45,000 for an individual and $94,000 for a family of four.\n\nThe more a family makes, argues NCPA senior fellow Devon Herrick, the lower their potential subsidy will be, which may make young couples in particular think twice before getting married. Herrick\u2019s study uses two unmarried college students who move in together, each earning $23,000 annually. If this same couple married, they would rise to $46,000 in annual household income, and increasing their rank as a percent of the FPL from 200% to 296%.\n\nAs singles, each would qualify for a subsidy of $1,087, or $2,174 per household. But married, their joint subsidy falls to $753. Herrick points out that moderate-income couples are twice as likely to forgo marriage than those with a bachelor\u2019s degree.\n\nBut programs that use the FPL as a measure to scale benefits can create perverse incentives among beneficiaries.\n\n\u201cIf you provide an incentive for someone to take a certain action, they will be inclined to do that,\u201d Herrick says.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nCBS even reported earlier this month that a New York-based couple was contemplating divorce to save cash under the ACA\u2019s subsidy program (http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/11/06/obamacare-restrictions-lead-brooklyn-couple-to-consider-divorce/). Herrick says divorce may be a major stretch here, but for young couples contemplating whether or not marriage is worth it when they are already stretching to pay for coverage could be a reality.\n\n\u201cThis will impact some people,\u201d Herrick says. \u201cThere is already a huge gap among young people\u2014throw in other disincentives to enroll, and it is never good.\u201d\n\nMarvin Solomiany, partner at Kessler & Solomiany Family Law Attorneys in Atlanta and a member of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, agrees, and says younger individuals may decide living together unmarried is their best bet to save cash.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible young people would continue to live together without getting married, especially younger individuals,\u201d Solomiany says. \u201cIf they are making a combined income of less than $65,000. The reverse is that there may be individuals who look to get divorced to enjoy the subsidies they would otherwise not be able to enjoy if they were married.\u201d\n\nThat being said, divorces are messy and costly, so while people may float the idea, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a definite motive to take the plunge and file divorce papers in the name of a subsidy, Solomiany says.\n\n\u201cSome may consider it, but this is easier said than done,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2016-01-10 09:50:53 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "New research from the National Center for Policy Analysis details why the subsidy program within the Affordable Care Act may make some couples think twice before walking down the aisle.", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2013/11/12/obamacare-subsidy-program-discouraging-marriage.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2013/11/12/obamacare-subsidy-program-discouraging-marriage/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452436697260.jpg?ve=1", "description": "New research from the National Center for Policy Analysis details why the subsidy program within the Affordable Care Act may make some couples think twice before walking down the aisle.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "ObamaCare Subsidy Program Discouraging Marriage?"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"Kate Rogers\",\"subSection\":\"features\",\"title\":\"ObamaCare Subsidy Program Discouraging Marriage?\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-business/features/2013/11/12/obamacare-subsidy-program-discouraging-marriage/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1452436697260.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-12T19:47:35Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2013/11/12/obamacare-subsidy-program-discouraging-marriage.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"efa95578-7f9d-42dc-8836-0311d2e8a43f\",\"section\":\"features\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fbn", "dc.description": "New research from the National Center for Policy Analysis details why the subsidy program within the Affordable Care Act may make some couples think twice before walking down the aisle.", "dc.identifier": "efa95578-7f9d-42dc-8836-0311d2e8a43f", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "description": "New research from the National Center for Policy Analysis details why the subsidy program within the Affordable Care Act may make some couples think twice before walking down the aisle.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "features", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Obamacare Subsidy Program Discouraging Marriage?", "dcterms.created": "2016-01-10 09:50:53 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "New research from the National Center for Policy Analysis details why the subsidy program within the Affordable Care Act may make some couples think twice before walking down the aisle.", "title": "ObamaCare Subsidy Program Discouraging Marriage?
