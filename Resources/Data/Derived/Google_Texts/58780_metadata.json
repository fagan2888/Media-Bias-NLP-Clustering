Ted Cruz says that as far as he\u2019s concerned, the Supreme Court will not have the final word on issues such as same-sex marriage and President Barack Obama\u2019s federal healthcare program.\n\nCruz, a Texas Republican who is running for president, says he is making the Supreme Court\u2019s decision Friday to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide a \u201cfront-and-center\u201d issue of his campaign. The day before that ruling, the nation's highest court upheld the Affordable Care Act against a challenge that had galvanized a lot of Republican support.\n\nIn media interviews over the weekend, Cruz characterized the country's top court as being out of control and says he wants justices elected rather than appointed and not to hold their positions indefinitely.\n\n\"This week in response to both of these decisions, I have called for another constitutional amendment \u2014 this one that would make members of the Supreme Court subject to periodic judicial retention elections,\" said Cruz in an interview with NPR.\n\n\"That is very much front-and-center something I intend to campaign on,\" Cruz said. \"And marriage and religious liberty are going to be integral, I believe, to motivating the American people to come out and vote for what is, ultimately, restoring our constitutional system.\"\n\nIn an interview with Fox News on Friday night, Cruz said, \u201cToday is some of the darkest 24 hours in our nation\u2019s history. Yesterday and today were both naked and shameless judicial activism.\u201d\n\nCruz says in no uncertain terms that he wants to show voters he is a true conservative, unlike some others who profess to be but whose actions do not match their words.\n\nWhile several GOP presidential candidates have indicated that they favor \u201ctraditional marriage\u201d between a man and a woman, they say they respect the Supreme Court\u2019s decision as the law of the land.\n\nIn fact, according to several published reports, some Republican contenders privately have expressed relief that the court essentially has closed the door on issues they did not want to deal with during the primaries.\n\nCandidate and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush believes that same-sex marriage should be decided by states, but at the same time, he says, everyone is entitled to respect.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, another Florida Republican also running for president, said he personally does not agree with same-sex marriage, but the Supreme Court decision is the law.\n\nCruz says he doesn\u2019t necessarily see a Supreme Court decision as the end of the argument. \"The parties to a case cannot ignore a direct judicial order, but it does not mean that those who are not parties to a case are bound by a judicial order,\" he says.\n\nAs for Obamacare, he told NPR, \"The Supreme Court's decision has made 2016 a referendum on repealing every single word of Obamacare.\"\n\n\"In the 2016 primary, you're going to have 15 candidates up there going, 'I'm conservative! No, no, I'm conservative!'\" said Cruz.\n\n\"It's very easy for Republican politicians to stand up and say they oppose Barack Obama. That's not hard to do,\" he observed. \"I think the question Republican primary voters should ask is, 'When have you stood up against the Washington cartel? When have you stood up against leaders in our own party?'\"\n\nLike us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter & Instagram", "article_metadata": {"classification": "LANGUAGES/English", "dcterms.modified": "2015-06-29 11:31:48 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "Presidential candidate Ted Cruz says in no uncertain terms that he wants to show voters that he is a true conservative, unlike others who profess to be but whose actions do not match their words.", "twitter": {"image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/politics/0/0/Cruz%20AP%20shooting%204.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "site": "@foxnewslatino", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@foxnewslatino"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News Latino", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Ted Cruz says Supreme Court won\\u0027t have last word on Obamacare, same-sex marriage\",\"link\":\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2015/06/29/ted-cruz-says-supreme-court-wont-have-last-word-on-obamacare-same-sex-marriage/\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/global.fncstatic.com/static/managed/img/fn-latino/politics/0/0/Cruz%20AP%20shooting%204.jpg?ve=1&tl=1\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"4266e2848af3e410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD\",\"section\":\"politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-06-29T15:31:48Z\",\"tags\":[\"LANGUAGES/English\"]}", "prism.aggregationType": "front", "keywords": "running for president,Jeb Bush,Marco Rubio,Supreme Court decision,Fox News,Barack Obama,Ted Cruz,Republican primary voters,Court decision,President Obama,primary voters,Supreme Court", "prism.channel": "fnl", "dc.description": "Presidential candidate Ted Cruz says in no uncertain terms that he wants to show voters that he is a true conservative, unlike others who profess to be but whose actions do not match their words.", "dc.identifier": "urn:uuid:4266e2848af3e410VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0RCRD", "pagetype": "article", "dc.subject": "running for president,Jeb Bush,Marco Rubio,Supreme Court decision,Fox News,Barack Obama,Ted Cruz,Republican primary voters,Court decision,President Obama,primary voters,Supreme Court", "description": "El gigante de Redmond podr\u00eda lanzar dos nuevos modelos de Xbox One que llegar\u00edan al mercado en los pr\u00f3ximos dos a\u00f1os, seg\u00fan reporta Kotaku.
