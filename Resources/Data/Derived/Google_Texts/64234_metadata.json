Monday night's sting netted 11 arrests.\n\n\"Word will spread out on Robinson,\" said prostitution activist Brian Bates, \"and it will probably keep the activity down over the next several days.\"\n\nBates captured some of the police operation on camera. He noticed some of the suspected prostitutes are repeat offenders, but said it doesn't usually work the same way with their customers.\n\n\"Hopefully we won't see those Johns again,\" said Bates, \"and fortunately I almost never see a John's name twice.\"\n\nDuane Compton said he'd be happy if the sting kept even one prostitute from doing business on his street. He's realistic, though, about making a serious dent in the illicit activity.\n\n\"It won't stop, I don't think it ever will\" said Compton. \"[But] if they're gonna do it, go somewhere else.\"", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "An area where police responded to a shooting Tuesday afternoon was just blocks away from where police conducted an undercover operation hours earlier.", "author": "Lisa Monahan", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/23761105/okc-police-arrest-nearly-a-dozen-people-in-prostitution-ring", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/23761105_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "An area where police responded to a shooting Tuesday afternoon was just blocks away from where police conducted an undercover operation hours earlier.", "title": "OKC Police Arrest Nearly A Dozen People In Prostitution Ring"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/23761105_SA.jpg", "description": "An area where police responded to a shooting Tuesday afternoon was just blocks away from where police conducted an undercover operation hours earlier.", "card": "summary", "title": "OKC Police Arrest Nearly A Dozen People In Prostitution Ring"}, "wnreadableurl": "okc-police-arrest-nearly-a-dozen-people-in-prostitution-ring", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2013/10/22", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media, crime, prostitution, ring, 11 arrests, johns, news 9, kwtv, news9.com", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS10", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media, crime, prostitution, ring, 11 arrests, johns, news 9, kwtv, news9.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce44b\"", "article_summary": "\"I've got neighbor kids that live right behind me, the come up here and play.\"\nUnfortunately, Compton said, the sting won't have a lasting impact.\n43rd and Robinson, and arrested nearly a dozen people involved in prostitution.\nPolice say they frequently get complaints from the people who live in the area, and respond on a regular basis.\n\"Hopefully we won't see those Johns again,\" said Bates, \"and fortunately I almost never see a John's name twice.\""}
