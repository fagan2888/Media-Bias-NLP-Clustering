Fred Upton, R-Mich., asked for \u201ca full explanation for, and all documents relating to\u201d the administration\u2019s decision to make the cost-sharing payments without congressional authorization.\n\nIn response, on Wednesday, the Treasury Department sent a letter to Ryan largely describing the program, without offering a detailed explanation of the decision to make the payments. The letter revealed that $2.997 billion in such payments had been made in 2014, but didn't elaborate on where the money came from. Over the next decade, cost-sharing payments to insurers are projected by the Congressional Budget Office to cost taxpayers nearly $150 billion.\n\nInstead of detailing the basis for making the payments without appropriations, Treasury officials cited the ongoing House GOP litigation, and referred Ryan to the Department of Justice.\n\nIn a brief filed on Jan. 26, DOJ lawyers wrote that the Boehner lawsuit was incorrect in saying that the payments required annual appropriation. \u201cThe cost sharing reduction payments are being made as part of a mandatory payment program that Congress has fully appropriated,\u201d the brief read.\n\nBut this argument is undercut by the administration\u2019s own previous budget request.\n\nFor fiscal year 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (the division of Health and Human Services that implements the program), asked Congress for an annual appropriation of $4 billion to finance the cost-sharing payments that year and another $1.4 billion \u201cadvance appropriation\u201d for the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, \u201cto permit CMS to reimburse issuers \u2026\u201d\n\nIn making the request, CMS was in effect acknowledging that it needed congressional appropriations to make the payments. But when Congress rejected the request, the administration went ahead and made the payments anyway.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2015/02/hhs_pays_obamacare_insurers_3_billion_that_congress_never_authorized.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: HHS pays Obamacare insurers $3 billion that Congress never authorized"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde22a\"", "article_summary": "Over the next decade, cost-sharing payments to insurers are projected by the Congressional Budget Office to cost taxpayers nearly $150 billion.\nWashington Examiner:Health and Human Services spending on these cost-sharing payments is one of the issues named in House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s lawsuit against the Obama administration's executive actions on Obamacare.\n\u201cThe cost sharing reduction payments are being made as part of a mandatory payment program that Congress has fully appropriated,\u201d the brief read.\nBut when Congress rejected the request, the administration went ahead and made the payments anyway.\nThe letter revealed that $2.997 billion in such payments had been made in 2014, but didn't elaborate on where the money came from."}
