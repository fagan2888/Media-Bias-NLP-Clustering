It has been said that history is written by the victors.

From that point of view, Clayton Kershaw’s dominating performance against the Rockies on Friday night at Coors Field was another tour de force.

The Los Angeles Dodgers lefty extended his scoreless innings streak to 36 innings — 17 contributed by the Rockies — as the Dodgers cruised to a 9-0 victory. Kershaw allowed two hits and struck out eight in eight innings. He walked only one.

“His slider is the best pitch in the game right now,” said Colorado outfielder Drew Stubbs, who went 0-for-2 but managed to draw the lone walk off Kershaw.

From the loser’s perspective, it was just another night of misery in a season that has become a nightmare. The nightmare got even worse when starting pitcher Jair Jurrjens was taken to a hospital during the game for what the Rockies called “breathing problems.” It is not considered a serious situation, the Rockies said.

The loss was the Rockies’ fifth straight and their 16th in their past 18 games. They have lost 14 of their past 18 at Coors Field.

“At this point, we’ve got to be tired of getting kicked around,” manager Walt Weiss said. “It’s up to us to do something about it. Guys show up and compete well every day, but it’s time to turn it around.”

Kershaw’s latest masterpiece came 16 days after he no-hit the Rockies at Dodger Stadium on a night when he struck out 15 and came within an error of perfection.

Kershaw somehow found a way to tip his cap to the Rockies, who are playing without their biggest guns. Carlos Gonzalez and Michael Cuddyer are on the disabled list and Troy Tulowitzki didn’t play Friday because of tightness in his right groin.

“They’ve got a great team,” Kershaw said. “Obviously, not having Tulo or CarGo or Cuddyer makes a difference. They’ve got some guys who can really swing the bats over there. You really have to give credit to our team. I feel like every time I’m pitching, I have a big lead. That’s awesome.”

Simply put, Kershaw is channeling Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax.

DJ LeMahieu finally got a hit off Kershaw with one out in the third inning. Colorado’s other hit off Kershaw was leadoff single by Nolan Arenado in the seventh.

Realistically, the Rockies never had a chance. They trotted out Jurr jens as their latest emergency starter in their injury-riddled rotation. Jurrjens was gone after 4 ⅔ innings, having given up eight runs on 12 hits, including two home runs. This was a mismatch of epic proportions. Consider that Kershaw has given up just 20 runs all season, and seven of them came in one bad start.

Kershaw, who could be on his way to winning his third National League Cy Young Award, has never been better. He’s so versatile, he leaves batters’ heads spinning.

“The thing that makes him so good is how he mixes his pitches,” said outfielder Corey Dickerson, who was the first and the last Rockies batter when Kershaw threw his no-hitter. “He throws that slow curve and gets you off-balance, and then he throws the fastball or slider. His pitches sneak up on you.”

And it’s not as though Kershaw had dominated the Rockies at Coors Field in the past. He came into the game with a 6-3 record and 5.02 ERA in 14 career starts at Coors Field. But he’s a better pitcher than ever before.

The numbers show how Kershaw has evolved. His percentage of fastballs is a career-low 55.4 percent, while his sliders are at a career-high 30 percent. Then he drops in his confounding curveball.

More numbers to justify his greatness: Entering Friday’s game, he had struck out 34.7 percent of the batters faced this season, best in the majors. He had walked only 3.6 percent, sixth in the majors and well below his career-best 5.7 percent in 2013.

The game was effectively over in the first inning when the Dodgers hit for the cycle and posted three runs against Jurrjens, the 13th different Rockies starter this season. In order, the Dodgers got a bunt single by Dee Gordon, a two-run homer to center by Yasiel Puig, a double by Hanley Ramirez and a run-scoring triple by Andre Ethier.

Scott Van Slyke’s three-run homer to left off Jurrjens in the fifth put the Dodgers ahead 6-0. Then they added two more runs in the inning for a cushion that Kershaw would never need.

Dodgers’ Dan Haren (8-4, 3.57 ERA) at Rockies’ Jorge De La Rosa (8-6, 4.86), 2:10 p.m. Saturday, ROOT; 850 AM

The Rockies might actually have an advantage in Saturday’s pitching matchup vs. the Dodgers — if De La Rosa brings his best stuff. But that’s been a major “if” during his up-and-down season. Historically, the lefty has struggled against the Dodgers, going 3-10 with a 6.17 ERA. Adrian Gonzalez has ripped De La Rosa, batting .368 (14-for-38) with three homers, three doubles and 11 RBIs. The Rockies usually match up pretty well vs. Haren, who’s 7-7 with a 4.55 ERA in 16 career starts vs. Colorado.
