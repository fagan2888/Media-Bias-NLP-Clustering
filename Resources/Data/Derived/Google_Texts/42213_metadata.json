GOP purity wars that they hope to reignite in the beginning of the new Congress and in the run-up to the 2016 Senate races, when 24 Republican senators will be on the primary ballots.\n\nAfter being pummeled by the party establishment in the 2014 midterms, activist groups are looking at the fight over Cruz\u2019s contention that the spending bill is unconstitutional as their first opportunity to regroup and reestablish their relevance as Senate Republicans prepare to take the majority next year.\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s votes may by themselves inspire folks to say: \u2018I\u2019m running against this guy or this girl,\u2019\u201d said Ken Cuccinelli, the president of the Senate Conservatives Fund. \u201cI have a funny feeling that some people who weren\u2019t thinking of running two weeks ago are thinking of running now.\u201d\n\nSeven of the 20 Republicans who voted against Cruz are up for reelection in two years, including Sens. Dan Coats of Indiana, Mark Kirk of Illinois, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Lisa Murkowksi of Alaska. And 16 Republicans who are running again, such as Richard Burr of North Carolina and Rob Portman of Ohio, joined the Texas freshman, a sign that many are well aware of ammunition that could be used against them in a GOP primary.\n\nIn an interview Monday, Cruz was unapologetic, pointing out that \u201cjust about every senator up for reelection in 2016\u201d voted with him, saying he would battle his party\u2019s leadership in February if it does not take a firmer line when Homeland Security Department funding lapses.\n\nRepublican senators were particularly incensed at Cruz over his procedural antics. After the party had a solid several weeks watching Democratic divisions on full display, Cruz \u2014 along with Utah Sen. Mike Lee \u2014 mounted a surprise legislative strategy that only seemed to backfire, while serving to deeply divide Republicans and turn the story line in the final days of the lame-duck session of Congress against them.\n\nBy demanding a vote on a constitutional point-of-order on a $1.1 trillion spending bill on the grounds that it improperly funded President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration moves, Republicans were in a bind: Vote to kill a bill that must pass to keep the government open, or oppose the Cruz measure and be accused of supporting Obama\u2019s \u201camnesty\u201d for undocumented immigrants. Two dozen Republicans ultimately voted for the spending bill, and several took the unusual position of siding with Cruz to deem it unconstitutional but also approving the larger measure.\n\nGOP Sen. Pat Toomey, a conservative who faces a potentially tough reelection in the swing state of Pennsylvania in 2016, was one of the 20 Republicans who voted against Cruz\u2019s tactics, saying he would have preferred to have a stand-alone measure targeting the president\u2019s decision to defer deportations to millions of immigrants in the country illegally.\n\n\u201cThe point-of-order said that the segment of that [spending] bill was unconstitutional,\u201d Toomey, who also voted for the spending bill, said Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t think the legislation was unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans who voted against the plan were more sharply critical. By effectively forcing the Senate to return to session Saturday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) took full advantage, beginning the parliamentary process on nearly two dozen nominees and easing their way for confirmation votes. On Monday, one of those controversial nominees was confirmed: Vivek Murthy as surgeon general, despite strong opposition from the GOP and National Rifle Association. GOP and Democratic leadership aides later said there was little chance all those nominations would be confirmed this year had it not been for the Cruz-Lee tactics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that none of us were happy about the tactics that he chose without at least having the courtesy to let us know that was what he planned to do,\u201d said Coats, a Republican from Indiana running for reelection in 2016 who voted against Cruz and had to abruptly change weekend plans because of the conservatives\u2019 moves. \u201cWe had met as a caucus, we had an agreement, we had an exit strategy to limit the number of nominations. And every member has the right to do what he did, but it would have been nice to know about it.\u201d\n\nOthers who voted against the Cruz plan almost dared conservative groups to field a primary foe.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a primary,\u201d said Kirk, a moderate Republican. \u201cAnd from the poll data I\u2019ve looked at, a primary opponent would be extraordinarily foolish to come against me.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s happening on the GOP side is not unlike the deep divide among Democrats, who are struggling to find their footing as they return to the Senate minority and grapple with the rise of hardliners like Elizabeth Warren but also the need to cut deals with a Republican majority. In the last several days, there are signs that the senior lawmakers are resisting the push by the Cruz and Warren wings of their respective parties. In addition to the nearly half of Republicans who had split with Cruz, just 22 Democrats of the 55-member caucus voted with Warren against the omnibus spending bill after she spent days railing on the measure as too friendly to Wall Street.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a realignment, and after every election cycle \u2013 there\u2019s a reordering of priorities and jockeying and that\u2019s a part of it,\u201d said Sen. Brian Schatz, a liberal Hawaii Democrat who backed the spending package. \u201cBut certainly after this particular election cycle, there\u2019s more of it. And going into 2016 \u2026 many Democrats in the Senate have never been members of the minority.\u201d\n\nIn the new Senate, more than half of the members will be serving for the first time as a member of the majority or minority parties, meaning senators and their allies off the Hill will have to find new ways to be relevant. For conservative groups, that means berating incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Republicans running for reelection in 2016 if they begin to compromise with Democrats.\n\n\u201cIt is a missed opportunity,\u201d said Dan Holler, spokesman for Heritage Action, the conservative group, referring to Saturday\u2019s vote. \u201cConservatives will be paying very close attention to see if a Republican-controlled Congress will actually do what is necessary to stop Obama\u2019s amnesty.\u201d\n\nIn the interview, Cruz said while his party might get a pass on a procedural vote that never had any chance of passing in the Democratic Senate, he would hold McConnell and the rest of the caucus\u2019 feet to the fire in February when Department of Homeland Security funding expires and GOP leaders have vowed to fight Obama on immigration.\n\n\u201cSixty days from now we\u2019ll know the answer as to whether leadership will follow through on their very public commitments,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cOne of the benefits of the vote this weekend is most, if not all, of the senators that voted against the constitutional point of order have made it a point to clarify to reporters that on the substance, they believe the president\u2019s executive amnesty is unconstitutional. That clarification is important going into this battle in January and February.\u201d\n\nWhile many Republicans have already been ramping up their reelections ahead of 2016, and the prospects of defeating a well-funded incumbent are always slim, even the potential of a primary threat tends to force lawmakers to stick closely to the ideological views of their base and potentially spend big money.\n\nNorth Carolina Sen. Richard Burr was highly critical of Cruz\u2019s strategy in the government shutdown fight last year, calling it the \u201cdumbest idea\u201d to try to defund Obamacare in a funding bill knowing that Obama would simply veto it. But this time, Burr was on board with Cruz\u2019s attempts to derail the immigration funding in the must-pass spending measure, who ultimately voted for final passage of the spending deal.\n\n\u201cIt was real simple: It was saying the president didn\u2019t have the constitutional authority to do what he did,\u201d said Burr, who is up for reelection in 2016 and could face a primary challenge. \u201cI agree with [Cruz].\u201d\n\nAdded Portman: \u201cI just know from the start I was very upset by the president going around not just the Congress but, I think the American people. \u2026 It was a symbolic vote in that sense, and it was a way to make a statement.\u201d\n\nSens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Marco Rubio of Florida, two senators up for reelection, are the only ones who voted for the comprehensive immigration bill last year but voted with Cruz on the point-of-order Saturday. Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, who is up for reelection, called his vote with Cruz a \u201cstatement, basically\u201d against the president, even though he\u2019s the senior GOP approriator.\n\nCuccinelli, the head of the conservatives group, signaled that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) could be two of his top two targets in 2016. While McCain voted against the Cruz measure, Moran supported it, though Cuccinelli\u2019s group is targeting the Kansan for his role running the Senate GOP campaign committee that aided Sen. Thad Cochran in the Mississippi primary this year.\n\nAsked to respond to the ire on the right, McCain said he voted against the Cruz plan because the omnibus is constitutional. He insisted it would do no more to motivate the right than any other vote.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me at all,\u201d McCain said. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything about that.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Outside groups ride in to his defense.", "title": "Cruz reignites GOP civil war", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/ted-cruz-gop-civil-war-113592.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/15/141215_ted_cruz_ap_629.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Senate,Republicans,Ted Cruz", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Outside groups ride in to his defense.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3240\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe point-of-order said that the segment of that [spending] bill was unconstitutional,\u201d Toomey, who also voted for the spending bill, said Monday.\nAsked to respond to the ire on the right, McCain said he voted against the Cruz plan because the omnibus is constitutional.\nTwo dozen Republicans ultimately voted for the spending bill, and several took the unusual position of siding with Cruz to deem it unconstitutional but also approving the larger measure.\nSen.
