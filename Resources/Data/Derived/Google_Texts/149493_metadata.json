Weighing 44 lbs., the 8-month-old has to be placed on a special diet to help him lose weight.\n\nSantiago is double the median weight for a baby his age, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics \u2014 weighing at about the equivalent of a 6-year-old child. He is unable to move properly due to his rolls of fat, which caused his mother Eunice Fandino to seek medical aid.\n\nVolunteers from Chubby Hearts Foundation (Gorditos de Corazon) picked up the child after Fandino asked for help, and he was taken to Bogot\u00e1 for life-saving treatment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about his obesity,\u201d Fandino told RCN Television, according to ABC News. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to continue like this so, God willing, the treatment they\u2019re going to give him for his heart will work to reduce his weight.\u201d Doctors are placing Santiago on a fruit and vegetable diet and weaning him off baby formula, with the plan of getting him down to 17 lbs.\n\nFandino admits that her own \u201cignorance\u201d is what has caused Santiago\u2019s obesity. In order to calm him down, she just fed him. \u201cHe was born with an anxiety, so if he cried I just fed him,\u201d Fandino told El Espectador.\n\nDoctors at the Colina Clinic believe he will need long-term treatment, including proper \u201ceducation, healthy food, and when he is older, physical activity,\u201d Cesar Ernesto Guevar, a surgeon, told El Espectador. \u201cOtherwise, in the future, he could suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure and severe problems with his joints.\u201d\n\nInfants are meant to be somewhat plump \u2014 that\u2019s where the name \u201cbaby fat\u201d comes from. But babies who gain weight far too quickly can be a concern. \u201cExcess or accelerated weight gain even in the first four or six months of life may be setting up kids for overweight, for higher blood pressure, maybe even asthma over the first years in childhood,\u201d Dr. Matthew Gillman, a pediatrician and epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School, told NPR. \u201cI was a pretty chubby baby myself,\u201d he added.\n\nABC US News | ABC Business News", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "santiago, obese baby", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A 44-pound baby in Colombia has been sent to Bogot\u00e1 for life-saving medical treatment and will be placed on a fruit and vegetable diet to curb his weight.", "title": "44-Pound Baby Placed On Fruit And Vegetable Diet [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/44-pound-baby-placed-fruit-and-vegetable-diet-too-heavy-carry-around-271686", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/20/obese-baby.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A 44-pound baby in Colombia has been sent to Bogot\u00e1 for life-saving medical treatment and will be placed on a fruit and vegetable diet to curb his weight.", "title": "44-Pound Baby Placed On Fruit And Vegetable Diet [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/44-pound-baby-placed-fruit-and-vegetable-diet-too-heavy-carry-around-271686", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/20/obese-baby.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/20/obese-baby.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-03-19T18:20:17-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-20T10:31:28-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A 44-pound baby in Colombia has been sent to Bogot\u00e1 for life-saving medical treatment and will be placed on a fruit and vegetable diet to curb his weight."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6b30\"", "article_summary": "A Colombian baby, Santiago, has made headlines as one of the fattest infants in the world.\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about his obesity,\u201d Fandino told RCN Television, according to ABC News.\n\u201cHe was born with an anxiety, so if he cried I just fed him,\u201d Fandino told El Espectador.\nWeighing 44 lbs., the 8-month-old has to be placed on a special diet to help him lose weight.\nand will require life-saving treatment in order to bring his weight down."}
