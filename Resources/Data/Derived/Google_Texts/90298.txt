BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - The Latest on a police shooting in Baton Rouge (all times local):

3:30 p.m.

A Baton Rouge prosecutor says he believes police were “totally justified” in their actions in a Saturday morning shootout that left two officers and a suspect wounded.

East Baton Rouge Parish District Attorney Hillar Moore tells The Associated Press that he reached the conclusion after viewing dashboard camera videos from the officers’ two police cars.

Moore says 22-year-old Calvin Smith shot first at the two officers after getting out of the car Smith was driving, calling it an “ambush.” The officers had been chasing Smith.

Gina Chambers of Baton Rouge says Smith, the son of her godmother, is on a ventilator in a hospital and may not live.

Moore says a bullet grazed one officer’s head; the other officer was hit in the stomach but protected by his bulletproof vest.

An official identifies Calvin Smith as the man that Baton Rouge police suspect shot two officers in a predawn gunbattle Saturday that ended up with Smith and the officers wounded.

East Baton Rouge Parish District Attorney Hillar Moore said the 22-year-old Smith is on probation for a 2014 conviction in Baton Rouge for indecent behavior with a juvenile.

Gina Chambers of Baton Rouge says Smith, the son of her godmother, was hospitalized in Shreveport last year after a suicide attempt.

Police say Smith led them on a roughly 2 mile chase after 5:30 a.m. Saturday before firing at them with a rifle. Moore says a bullet grazed the head of one officer; the other officer was hit in the stomach but protected by his bulletproof vest.
