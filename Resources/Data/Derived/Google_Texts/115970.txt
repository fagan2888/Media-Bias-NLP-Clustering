Clean water continues to be an issue here in Southwest Florida. A rally on Fort Myers Beach on Sunday focused on putting an end to the problem.

The event also honored the life of Joanne Finney, who was a clean water advocated and died earlier this year.

Their voices were loud, and their signs were held high above their heads. A group was out on Fort Myers Beach for a cause, they say, is an important one.

“To promote the idea of clean water as a basic human right,” said activist John Heim.

“When you see brown water and ours are turquoise and blue, it hurts us,” said activist Ceel Spuhler.

It was a familiar rallying point for many that was echoed across Southwest Florida.

Amidst the yells for clean water, one person was noticeably missing. Joanne Finney was the organizer of the event.

“Her spirit was 100 percent right now. We all know that Jo Finney is with us,” said Heim. “Jo was a great person when it came to our environment, our area of where we live.”

Finney was tragically killed in a fire at her Fort Myers Beach home.

“A good role model for not only us as adults, but our children as well. She was a terrific human being,” said Heim.

She was a role model, they say, who worked to end releases from Lake Okeechobee. But those releases, the Army Corps. of Engineers say, are necessary when the lake gets too full.

“This is our home as Southwest Florida. We’re 100 percent tourism driven, and we depend on clean water,” said Heim.

In honor of Finney, the movement is now named after her – the Jo Finney Clean Water Movement. Organizers say it will continue to go on.

“It’s a huge gap in our society…losing Jo Finney. We’re still a community trying to pick up the pieces to figure out how to fill that gap,” said Heim.
