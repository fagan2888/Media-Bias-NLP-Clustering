And thanks to some of the least restrictive laws in the nation regarding political gift-giving, Pennsylvania\u2019s pols have a constant stream of expensive presents waiting to be unwrapped.\n\nUnder state law, elected officials must disclose all gifts valued at more than $250, unless they are given by a family member or friend. Transportation, lodging and hospitality valued at more than $650 also must be reported.\n\nThe quarterly financial disclosures filed by lobbyists and the annual statements of financial interest filed by state lawmakers give a glimpse at gifts that range from the mundane to the extraordinary.\n\n\u201cThese gifts are there for one reason: to create preferred relationships with policymakers that other taxpayers are not able to have,\u201d said Barry Kauffman, executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania, a group which supports reforming the state\u2019s policy for political gift-giving.\n\nKauffman said he would like to see a full ban on gifts that exceed the value of a cup of coffee, like several others states have. If that\u2019s not possible, he said, then the $250 threshold should be eliminated so all gifts would have to be reported.\n\nAnd gift-giving in Pennsylvania politics is big business. Lawmakers reported more than $43,000 in gifts on their 2012 financial disclosure forms, according to an Associated Press analysis. That total doesn\u2019t count all gifts valued at less than $250 \u2014 which can cover a pretty nice dinner and lots of other things, so the actual total is probably much higher.\n\nFrom 2007 through 2011, lawmakers reported more than $117,000 in gifts, according to a separate analysis done by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.\n\nThough the filings for 2013 won\u2019t be available until April, lawmakers in previous years have reported gifts that would surely be on every Pennsylvanians\u2019 wish list.\n\nSports tickets and souvenirs are hot items.\n\nIn 2009, state Sen. Jake Corman, R-Centre, reported getting tickets valued at $4,000 to see the Pittsburgh Steelers play in the Super Bowl in Tampa, Fla., where they defeated the Arizona Cardinals to win their sixth title. He was the guest of Steelers owner Art Rooney.\n\nIn 2010, Corman received $748.75 from Coventry First LLC, a life insurance group in Fort Washington, for tickets to two Philadelphia Phillies baseball games.\n\nIn 2012, Lt. Gov. Jim Cawley got an autographed baseball bat worth an estimated $100 from the Phillies.\n\nSeveral state lawmakers have reported free tickets to Penn State University football games.\n\nAnd then there are the free trips.\n\nState Sen. Mike Brubaker, R-Lancaster, got a $10,900 trip to Turkey paid for by Bogazici Atlantik Kulturel Dostluk Veis Birligi Dernegi, a cultural exchange group. Brubaker has also taken trips to Nova Scotia and Taiwan in recent years.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Dominic Pileggi, R-Chester, and state Rep. Dan Frankel, D-Allegheny, attended conferences in Ireland and had the trips paid for by the hosts.\n\nIn 2012, Gov. Tom Corbett accepted $1,400 in free travel for a vacation to Rhode Island paid for by John Moran, president of Moran Industries, a Pennsylvania based company that specializes in trucking, rail and warehousing.\n\nCorbett also reported taking a $11,000 trip to France in 2012, with the cost covered by the Team Pennsylvania Foundation, which sponsors trade missions. While there, the governor received one of the more unique gifts reported by state policymakers: a $275 fountain pen.\n\nCorbett also got two Turkish robes and towels, along with a vase and plate, valued at $275 from the Turkish Cultural Center Pennsylvania.\n\nTen states have full bans on gifts for politicians, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Another 31 states have monetary limits, ranging from $3 per day in Iowa to the Texas limit of $500 for gifts and another $500 for entertainment per year.\n\nAccording to NCSL, Pennsylvania is one of just 10 states with no monetary limits on gifts, though Pennsylvania law specifies that gifts may not be given or received if they are intended to influence decisions.\n\nBut Michael Coulter, a professor of political science at Grove City College, told the House State Government Committee in September that most people see through that provision.\n\n\u201cFor most of the general public, distinguishing between a gift intended to influence and one that isn\u2019t so intended seems like a distinction without a difference,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd if the gift-giving process was not producing results, it would not continue, Kauffman said.\n\nHe said the gifts that don\u2019t get reported can be as important as the big ticket items like the trips.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so much the value of the gifts. It\u2019s the relationship that is developed,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral bills have been introduced this year to change the state\u2019s law about political gift-giving. Some would ban gifts entirely, while others would place stricter limits on the value and type of gifts that can be given.\n\nBut since the September hearing on tightening the state gift laws and other laws pertaining to lawmakers\u2019 ethics, there has been little movement on the issue.\n\nFor Pennsylvania\u2019s public officials, it will continue to be Christmas all the time.\n\nBoehm is a reporter for Watchdog.org and can be reached at Eric@PAIndependent.com.
