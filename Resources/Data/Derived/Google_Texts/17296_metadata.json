We need to be doing more.\u201dAdvocates say that a legal system that is perceived to be both intimidating and difficult to navigate remains the foremost obstacle to reporting for immigrants, a topic that was examined at the Santa Clara County Domestic Violence Conference on Oct. 3. The annual event, which ushered in Domestic Violence Awareness Month, focused on the role the legal system plays in domestic violence response.The Santa Clara County Domestic Violence Council, which organizes the conference, recognized the county\u2019s 11 police departments and the County Sheriff\u2019s Office for adopting the Language Access Protocol, which requires police to call for another officer conversant in that language or to find a certified translator when encountering a victim with limited English proficiency.\u201cYou won\u2019t be using children or neighbors to translate,\u201d council chair Julie Saffren said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be able to make sure that you get accurate information. That will mean better police reports and better safety.\u201d\n\nAll police departments in the county follow the protocol, with the San Jose Police Department becoming the latest to adopt it in August. The protocol was prompted in part by a 2005 grand jury investigation that identified language barriers as a major issue in a county in which more than half of the households primarily speak a language other than English.\n\nIn March 2013, President Barack Obama signed an extension of the Violence Against Women Act that extends protection to those in the country illegally if they report domestic violence. But the fear of deportation, activists say, remains a major barrier.\u201cWe need to be doing better outreach to the immigrant community to make sure that everyone knows that there\u2019s help for you,\u201d Gibbons-Shapiro said, \u201cthat if you\u2019re being victimized, that we\u2019re going to hold the perpetrator accountable regardless of your immigration status, and that we want you to ask for help regardless of your immigration status. We\u2019re never going to be asking for your immigration status.\u201dVictims can also be wary to report abuse because of social stigmas or a lack of understanding of domestic violence.\u201cI know that in Mexico, it\u2019s something that\u2019s just normal, so when they come here, it can also be normalized,\u201d said Sylvia Mata, a Spanish-speaking advocate for Silicon Valley Faces, one of the county\u2019s five domestic violence service agencies. \u201cEspecially the way people react to domestic violence, there might not be a lot of support within their own communities.\u201dSaffren spoke of the importance of \u201cculturally competent\u201d advocates when working for support and prevention of domestic violence, highlighting the diverse agencies that serve Santa Clara County, in which nearly two out of five people are foreign-born. Maitri focuses on domestic violence support for the South Asian community, while Asian Americans for Community Involvement (AACI), the county\u2019s largest Asian-American organization, operates the Asian Women\u2019s Home.\u201cThose who work with domestic violence clients need to understand that culture walks into the room with you when you\u2019re working with any client,\u201d Saffren said.Maitri\u2019s legal program manager Zakia Afrin said agencies\u2019 top priority, especially for immigrant communities, remains to address the practical challenges of leaving an abusive relationship, such as access to housing and food.\u201cThe abuser may be the only person they know in the community,\u201d Afrin said. \u201cThose are real challenges, and I believe that more than anything, it\u2019s these practical challenges that prevent immigrant women from reporting domestic violence.\u201dAfrin was honored at the Domestic Violence Conference as the 2014 recipient of the Outstanding Advocate Award, the second year in a row an advocate focusing on the Asian community was selected. Last year\u2019s award was presented to Nguyet-Anh Le of the Asian Women\u2019s Home.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Domestic violence-related assistance calls have gone down 32 percent since 2004 in the county, but activists say that may be skewed by underreporting of cases, especially within immigrant communities.", "title": "CORRECTION: Domestic violence cases likely underreported among Santa Clara County's immigrant communities - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Domestic-Violence-Chart-STATIC-version.png", "updated_time": "2015-01-06T15:46:20+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2014/10/27/domestic-violence-santa-clara-county/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Crime", "tag": "Santa Clara County Domestic Violence Conference", "published_time": "2014-10-27T08:48:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-06T15:46:20+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Domestic violence-related assistance calls have gone down 32 percent since 2004 in the county, but activists say that may be skewed by underreporting of cases, especially within immigrant communities.", "title": "CORRECTION: Domestic violence cases likely underreported among Santa Clara County's immigrant communities - Peninsula Press", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Domestic-Violence-Chart-STATIC-version.png", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef70\"", "article_summary": "Domestic violence-related assistance calls have gone down 32 percent in Santa Clara County since 2004, but activists say that success may be skewed by underreporting of cases, especially within the county\u2019s substantial immigrant communities.\nIn March 2013, President Barack Obama signed an extension of the Violence Against Women Act that extends protection to those in the country illegally if they report domestic violence.\nWe need to be doing more.\u201dAdvocates say that a legal system that is perceived to be both intimidating and difficult to navigate remains the foremost obstacle to reporting for immigrants, a topic that was examined at the Santa Clara County Domestic Violence Conference on Oct. 3.\n\u201cThere is the recognition that some of the things that we\u2019ve done in the past 20 years that have been very successful may not be successful anymore because the demographics of the county have changed,\u201d Santa Clara County Assistant District Attorney James Gibbons-Shapiro said.\n\u201cEspecially the way people react to domestic violence, there might not be a lot of support within their own communities.\u201dSaffren spoke of the importance of \u201cculturally competent\u201d advocates when working for support and prevention of domestic violence, highlighting the diverse agencies that serve Santa Clara County, in which nearly two out of five people are foreign-born."}
