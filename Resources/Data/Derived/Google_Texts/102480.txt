President Obama will deliver yet another State of the Union Address with much the same message and policy prescription of his first six: Spread the wealth around. He wants $320 billion in new taxes on both the middle class and wealthy over the next decade to pay for income redistribution handout programs that are supposed to help the poor and middle class.

But Obama has been president now for six years. If his redistribution policies worked, why are the poor getting poorer and why has the middle class stalled out? Is this George Bush’s fault?

The irony of the Obama presidency is that a White House obsessed with income inequality has managed to produce only more inequality. Arguably every policy that this administration has pursued — from the $830 billion stimulus bill, to giant welfare program expan sions, to massive infusions of cheap money into the economy via the Federal Reserve, to ObamaCare and then tax increases on those at the top of the income ladder — was designed as part of a great Robin Hood strategy to take from the rich and give to the poor. Instead, by the president’s own admission, the bottom 90% have seen almost no progress.

Gini Out Of The Bottle

The Gini coefficient (as measured by the Census Bureau), the left’s favorite measure of income inequality, rose in each of Obama’s first four years in office, breaking all-time highs in both 2011 and 2012; it remains near those levels now. So Obama’s infatuation with steal from the rich and give to the poor has backfired. Just listen to a speech by the darlings of the left these days, Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren, and all you will hear is how the middle class has gotten shafted while Obama has been president. News alert: That may be why Democrats got wiped out in the last election.

So why would anyone think that more of the same is going to lead to a different result?

Mr. Obama likes to say that the middle class has been in a rut for decades. Nonsense. In the 1980s and 1990s, the middle class made startling financial progress. From 1983 to 2005, upward income mobility allowed the middle class to see a rise in real incomes of near 30%. That was an era of relatively low tax rates, free trade, a responsible Fed, welfare reform, and pro-business regulatory policies that allowed American companies to compete in world markets. Many people at the top became very wealthy, but the rising tide of that era lifted almost all boats.

What does Mr. Obama propose to help the middle class? Start with a series of boneheaded new taxes on the rich that sound like they were designed by French economist Thomas Piketty, the new guru on economics in liberal America. They could very easily stall the economy yet again:

Capital gains taxes would be raised to 28% from 23.8%. But the history of this tax is that when you raise it, you get less revenue, and when you lower it, Uncle Sam gets more money. This is a direct tax on the startup capital that people invest in small and startup businesses. Raising the tax will mean less money flows to get new American companies running, at a time when studies are showing that entrepreneurial ventures are already getting started at a slower pace under Obama. Fewer new businesses means fewer jobs.

Raise the estate and inheritance tax to 60%. Two years ago, Congress and the president reached a rare bipartisan deal to cap the death tax at 40%. Now Obama wants to raise it even further. But when you tax lifetime savings, the rich — who already have paid taxes on their income when they earned it — simply invest less in family businesses and find tax shelters to avoid paying the tax. Family-owned businesses are the lifeblood of the American economy, and if we want more jobs we need more investment in them, not less.

A new tax on banks. This seems like a small tax of 0.07% on liabilities at about 100 large financial firms with more than $50 billion in assets. But the end result of this tax (estimated at $110 billion over the next decade) will be to harm America’s status as the financial capital of the world. Kenneth E. Bentsen, CEO of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, warned last week the tax would penalize “America’s most productive financial institutions” and would “curtail economic growth.” How will making trades and deals that get made in firms based in Manhattan or Los Angeles or Chicago more expensive relative to those in Tokyo, Beijing, London, or Hong Kong help American workers?

What would this money be used for? Free stuff. Free community college. More dollars for student loans. Mandatory paid family leave. “Gender equity” in the workforce. Minimum-wage hikes. More infrastructure spending — just not for the Keystone XL pipeline. Tax credits for those at the bottom of the income scale, even though the vast majority of those in the bottom 40% already pay no income tax.

These tax-and-spend policies are hardly innovative or original. In fact, Europe has tested them for decades. In euroland, high investment and income taxes — along the lines of Obama and Piketty — pay for a vast social welfare state to help the poor. Nearly the entire continent is turning into an economic wasteland. Is the White House not paying attention?

To get wages rising again and to create more jobs for the poor, it would be a very helpful first step simply to stop bashing and penalizing the employers who provide the wages in the first place. Stop treating businesses like they are enemies of the state. Fix the corporate tax system. Reward, don’t penalize, our bountiful energy sector that has been such a major source of new jobs over the last nine years. At a minimum, repeal the anti-jobs incentives of ObamaCare.

Obama’s grab-bag of leftist policy solutions were almost all universally rejected by voters in November. He says that he has heard the message of voters, when in fact his State of the Union speech is an arrogant repudiation of their wish es. That is why Republicans should declare this stale “progressive” agenda dead on arrival and move forward with policies that will grow wages, reduce government overspending and overborrowing, and create a more prosperous economy that will bear fruit for all.

Obama still hopes to create more prosperity by focusing on fairness, and so far he has delivered neither.
