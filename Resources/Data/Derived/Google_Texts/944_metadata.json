It ends with Molly and the Statue of Liberty welcoming survivors of the Titanic to the land of liberty. The all-so-timely immigration theme is further advanced by accurately portraying Leadville\u2019s miners as a mixture of accented newcomers \u2014 Irish, German, Italian, even Chinese \u2014 who usually get excluded.\n\nA rousing \u201cBelly Up to the Bar, Boys\u201d scene is one of seven untouched surviving songs from the sickly sweet 1960 musical. This version centers on the \u201ccan\u2019t live with \u2019em, can\u2019t live without \u2019em\u201d marriage of Margaret Tobin and J.J. Brown. In continual clashing over her social activism, J.J. usually gives as good as he gets in fast, funny repartee.\n\nAt one point, Molly even shouts down myths about her, such as her entertaining Mark Twain with Mississippi River skinny-dipping back in Hannibal and burning up J.J.\u2019s fortune in her Leadville stove.\n\n\u201cThis is not a documentary,\u201d director Kathleen Marshall says right up front in the Applause program. It\u2019s \u201chistorical fiction.\u201d So don\u2019t complain about Horace Tabor (John F. Campion) showing up as the owner of the \u201cLouisville\u201d (Little Jonny) Mine. Mostly true names and places are used, from the Ice Palace to The Denver Post to Louise Sneed-Hill.\n\nLibrettist/lyricist Dick Scanlon toured Denver\u2019s Molly Brown House Museum, from which he borrowed the idea of a polar bear rug set. He used about half the original script and dug up four of Meredith Wilson\u2019s original unpublished songs to create new material. Scanlon said, \u201cI wanted to dispel the myth that Molly was in any way stupid.\u201d His more admirable Molly, reconstructed as a role model for latter-day aspiring minority women, feminists and women political candidates, may be rooted in the revisionist scholarship of books by Christine Whitacre and Kristin Iverson.\n\nLocals get a fine salute from this play with the songs \u201cColorado is my Home\u201d and \u201cBeautiful People of Denver.\u201d Beth Malone, a Colorado native, is gloriously rambunctious, acrobatic and convincing in her portrayal of Colorado\u2019s best-known woman. We now have a play that does her justice.\n\nAlthough not covered in this production, Brown was also a hero of historic preservation. When the cottage of celebrated poet-journalist Eugene Field faced demolition, Brown bought it and moved it in 1927 to Washington Park, where it still stands, restored and recycled for park use next to the Wynken, Blynken and Nod fountain inspired by Field\u2019s best-known poem.\n\nAfter Brown died in 1932, her house was converted to a home for wayward girls, then to an even more cramped boarding house for single men. By 1970, developers eyed the site as high-rises sprung up all round Capitol Hill. Historic Denver, Inc., formed to save the house and restore it. Executive director Annie Robb Levinsky reports that HDI has since sunk more than $1 million and 250,000 hours of volunteer time into Colorado\u2019s most popular house museum.\n\nTom Noel teaches Colorado history at CU-Denver and welcomes your comments at dr-colorado.com.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Noel: Unsinkable play boosts Molly Brown", "title": "Noel: Unsinkable play boosts Molly Brown", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/26/noel-unsinkable-play-boosts-molly-brown/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140926__molly-brownp1.jpg", "height": 523}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140926__molly-brownp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-26T11:18:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:41:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Librettist/lyricist Dick Scanlon toured Denver\u2019s Molly Brown House Museum, from which he borrowed the idea of a polar bear rug set.\nOnce again, the \u201cUnsinkable\u201d has bobbed to the surface with the Denver Center for the Performing Art\u2019s \u201cThe Unsinkable Molly Brown.\u201d This version, however, is oceans away from the original musical comedy, which portrays Molly as a dim-witted social climber.\nMargaret \u201cMolly\u201d Brown would be bursting with pride after Denver\u2019s new play about her was featured on the front page of The New York Times theater section last Sunday.\nIt ends with Molly and the Statue of Liberty welcoming survivors of the Titanic to the land of liberty.\nChanging with the tide and times, this \u201cUnsinkable\u201d delivers a strong pro-feminist, pro-labor, pro-immigrant message sweetened with wonderful wit."}
