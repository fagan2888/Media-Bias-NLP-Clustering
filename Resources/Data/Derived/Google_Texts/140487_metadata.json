Cruz country\n\nFORT WORTH, Texas \u2014 The stage was set for a clash of political titans as three likely presidential candidates and thousands of conservatives gathered here this weekend.\n\nInstead, the Texas GOP convention turned into a blowout bash for Ted Cruz.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Texas senator was introduced at times as \u201cthe next president of the United States.\u201d His speeches were punctuated by chants of \u201cRun, Ted, run!\u201d and supporters mobbed him at his huge exhibition booth. Cruz easily overshadowed fellow potential 2016ers at the event, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, and he dominated them in a presidential straw poll held there.\n\nMany establishment Republicans disdain Cruz\u2019s stick-it-to-Washington attitude, stoking doubts about whether his appeal is broad enough to win a national election. And the convention unfolded here as establishment Republicans have notched wins this year over grassroots insurgents in key races in states such as North Carolina, Kentucky, and, on Saturday, Virginia.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Cruz crushes competition in straw poll)\n\nBut the dynamics here show the strength, energy and numbers that still make the GOP grassroots powerful. And Cruz\u2019s reception \u2014 home-field advantage notwithstanding \u2014 offers a preview of the enthusiasm he could generate in other places where grassroots conservatives are active if he runs in 2016.\n\n\u201cWhat I am trying to do, more than anything else, is motivate and energize millions of grassroots activists in Texas and all around the country to stand up and demand we change course,\u201d Cruz told POLITICO.\n\nThe one big demand he faced in Fort Worth was to run for president.\n\nOn Thursday night, he addressed two events \u2014 a banquet sponsored by the Texas Eagle Forum, and a Defense of Texas Marriage Amendment rally \u2014 and both ended with standing ovations and chants of \u201cRun, Ted, run!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s just the most popular politician in Texas,\u201d said state Sen. Dan Patrick, who recently won the Republican nomination for Texas lieutenant governor. \u201cThey see a guy who\u2019s willing to take an arrow and stand up for the people. That fires people up.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s another story in Washington, where Cruz is dismissed by many in his own party for his hard-line approach, most memorably his encouragement of the government shutdown last fall. In the past, Cruz also has taken heat for not endorsing colleagues \u2014 including John Cornyn, the senior senator from Texas \u2014 in primary contests (though at least publicly, they seem to be on fine terms now).\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Cruz invokes Reagan to Texas GOP)\n\nCruz\u2019s soaring rhetoric and near-apocalyptic talk about saving the nation, which engenders eye rolls in Washington, brought crowds here to their feet. People responded to the freshman senator\u2019s speeches with \u201camens;\u201d a \u201cyou da man\u201d or two. But the most fervid responses often came when he hinted about his future plans.\n\n\u201cI tell you this: as good as 2014 is gonna be, 2016 is gonna be even better,\u201d Cruz said at the Defense of Texas Marriage event.\n\nCruz reveled in dinging D.C. The hash tag #makedclisten, popularized by the Cruz team during the shutdown, was plastered on the senator\u2019s posters, and Cruz remarked in his keynote speech on Friday that Ronald Reagan was \u201cdespised\u201d by Washington in 1980.\n\n\u201cI hope we see leaders who are willing to suffer the scorn of Washington,\u201d he told reporters later when asked about 2016. \u201cI will say this: Any candidate who is embraced by Washington, D.C., my advice to the people is, run and hide, \u2018cause that ain\u2019t how we\u2019re turning this country around.\u201d\n\nIn sheer size and noise, the Texas GOP convention made the annual Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington look like a staid gathering of moderate Republicans. The head count as of Friday night was about 7,000 and rising.\n\n( QUIZ: Do you know Ted Cruz?)\n\nThere was a \u201cpin the tail on the Democratic donkey\u201d booth hosted by a candidate for state comptroller; the \u201ctails\u201d featured toxic terms in conservative circles, such as \u201cgun control,\u201d \u201cObamacare\u201d and \u201chigher taxes.\u201d Or, for $600, you could buy a pair of boots dotted with crosses.\n\nCruz\u2019s massive booth in the exhibition hall appeared to be nearly twice the size of Paul\u2019s, situated right across the aisle.\n\nThe Cruz booth, designed to look like a rustic living room, featured plush chairs, a saddle, enormous letters spelling out the word \u201cTexas\u201d next to an even bigger Lone Star State flag and giveaways including T-shirts, cups and stickers. It was packed throughout the convention, and when Cruz appeared for a photo opportunity, the line snaked around two corners of the structure.\n\nFollow @politico", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Texas GOP convention turned into a blowout bash for the senator.", "title": "Cruz country", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/ted-cruz-107566.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/06/07/140607_ted_cruz2_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,Republicans,2016 Elections,Texas,Rand Paul,Rick Perry,Ted Cruz", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The Texas GOP convention turned into a blowout bash for the senator.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Instead, the Texas GOP convention turned into a blowout bash for Ted Cruz.\n( QUIZ: Do you know Ted Cruz?)\nIt was packed throughout the convention, and when Cruz appeared for a photo opportunity, the line snaked around two corners of the structure.\n\u201cWhat I am trying to do, more than anything else, is motivate and energize millions of grassroots activists in Texas and all around the country to stand up and demand we change course,\u201d Cruz told POLITICO.\nCruz easily overshadowed fellow potential 2016ers at the event, Kentucky Sen.
