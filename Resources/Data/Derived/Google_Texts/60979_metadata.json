(The apparent previous high of 486,200 jobs was set in the period from March 2015 through February 2016).\n\nHospitals drove the lion's share of new hiring, adding more than 183,000 jobs in the past year, but the uptick of Obamacare patients and investment appears to be fueling opportunities across the sector, from home health to physicians' offices. Even jobs in dentists' offices are growing about twice as fast as they had in recent years.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u2014 What bothers researchers: What do all these new jobs mean for bending the cost curve? \"Is this good news \u2026 or are we making the current healthcare infrastructure too big to be disrupted?\" Yale's Harlan Krumholz asked. \"The more jobs in healthcare, the less money we have for education, infrastructure, etc.\" Harvard's Ashish Jha added.\n\n\u2014 Health care's on pace to become the nation's biggest industry in three years. More than 15.4 million people now work in health care, up about 3 million in the past decade. The growth has been constant \u2014 total health care jobs outpaced manufacturing jobs seven years ago \u2014 and if current trendscontinue, the health care industry should overtake retail by 2019.\n\nWELCOME TO MONDAY PULSE \u2014 Where your author enjoys breaking down the BLS data like it's his job.

The rates have been the target of a furious lobbying campaign by insurers since the initial proposal was released in February. It\u2019s not hard to understand why: roughly $170 billion in federal funds are at stake.\n\nThe biggest question \u2026 is whether the Obama administration will back off plans to cut payments to employer-based MA plans, Pro's Paul Demko tells us. That\u2019s been a major focus of insurers\u2019 ire, with some business groups and labor unions joining in the fight.\n\nTwo other items worth watching: whether CMS a) goes forward with formula changes designed to more accurately compensate plans with chronically ill customers and b) significantly increases the use of medical claims data in determining payments.\n\nWHAT TRUMP SAYS NOW ABOUT ABORTION \u2014 The Sunday shows were dominated by fallout from Donald Trump's comment that a woman should be punished for having an abortion, and his multiple attempts to walk the statement back last week. \"He had five different positions that we've counted up this week on abortion,\" Chuck Todd said on Meet the Press.\n\n\"You did something pretty remarkable,\" Chris Wallace told Trump on Fox News Sunday. \"You offended both the pro-life and the pro-choice movements with one statement.\"\n\n\u2014 Trump tries to defend himself. \"The bottom line is that it [is] the doctor's fault,\" Trump said on Face the Nation. But he added that the original question \"was asked as a hypothetical\" where the procedure was viewed as illegal.\n\nThe hosts also grilled Trump on how to interpret his shifting position on abortion \u2014 and many other policy issues.\n\n\"People are so confused,\" John Dickerson told Trump on Face the Nation.\n\n\"I know they're confused,\" Trump replied. But \"they shouldn't be, because all they have to do is watch.\"\n\n\u2014 Hillary tries to separate herself. The Democratic front-runner continued to seize on Trump's misstep to portray herself as a leading \u2014 and consistent \u2014 defender of abortion rights.\n\n\"Women have a constitutional right to make these most intimate and personal and difficult decisions,\" Hillary Clinton said on Meet the Press. \"And when you have candidates running for president who say that there should be no exceptions, not for rape, not for incest, not for health, then I think you've gotten pretty extreme.\"\n\n\"My view has always been this is a choice. It is not a mandate.\"\n\nWHAT TRUMP's COMMENTS REVEALED: 'MORAL INCOHERENCE OF PRO-LIFERS' \u2014 So says bioethicist Arthur Caplan, writing in Forbes. He argues that anti-abortion-rights supporters who say abortion is murder refuse to grapple with the consequences for women \u2014 and Trump unintentionally pinpointed that disconnect.\n\n\"Demonizing abortion providers has been a popular option for pro-lifers since they do not engage women about their actions but rather beat up on the small number of abortion providers,\" Caplan writes.\n\nBut he thinks the strategy has backfired: The scrutiny of abortion clinics has led to their shuttering and the hastening of alternate approaches. \"The future of elective abortion is pharmaceutical not surgical,\" Caplan writes, and \"trying to demonize those who write prescriptions means demonizing plain old everyday doctors and nurses who are both popular and who won\u2019t put up with it.\"\n\n\u2014 Katha Pollitt concurs: Trump spoke the truth. Writing in the New York Times, the feminist critic claims Trump showed the hypocrisy at the heart of the abortion debate. \"In his blundering way, he revealed the true logic of the case against legal abortion: If it\u2019s murder, then murder has consequences,\" Pollitt argues. \"Too bad the moment of clarity couldn\u2019t last.\"\n\nMOST INFLUENTIAL DOCS \u2014 Modern Healthcare's annual list of most influential physicians is out, and new FDA commissioner Robert Califf took the top spot this year. CMS Chief Medical Officer Patrick Conway is third overall, VA Undersecretary for Health David Shulkin was 12th and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy was 22nd.\n\n\u2014 Other well-known names: Mayo Clinic CEO John Noseworthy and Cleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove were ranked in the top five; doctor-writers Bob Wachter, Atul Gawande and Eric Topol were among the top 25; and the NIH's Francis Collins, the CDC's Tom Frieden and HHS's Karen DeSalvo also made the list.\n\n\u2014 Does 'influence' have a gender bias? Just one woman \u2014 Brigham and Women's Hospital CEO Elizabeth Nabel \u2014 was ranked among the top 20.\n\nSee the list: http://bit.ly/1otlwgA\n\nSTATE WEEK: FUTURE OF ARKANSAS EXPANSION IN THE SPOTLIGHT \u2014 The state legislature's special session on Medicaid starts this week, when lawmakers will consider extending coverage for the Medicaid expansion population among other reforms, Pro's Rachana Pradhan and Brianna Ehley report. Meanwhile, New York's new budget deal has an interesting provision on Medicaid coverage for inmates.

She also called on CMS to \"hold hospices accountable for inappropriate billing, poor quality care, and the misuse of general inpatient care.\"\n\nWHY YOUR CITY WANTS TO BOOST THE COST OF COKE \u2014 Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney is pitching a 3 cents per ounce soda tax, less to fix public health and more to fill the public coffers. \"Governments are starting to think of soda taxes as the next sin tax \u2014 an untapped source of revenue that could help with other things,\" Margot Sanger-Katz writes in the New York Times.\n\nGiven the failure of soda-tax proposals in New York City and elsewhere \u2014 including two abandoned attempts in Philadelphia \u2014 other cities are eyeing Kenney's campaign with interest. \"I think Philadelphia may change the whole conversation about soda taxes,\" consultant Larry Tramutola says.

The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
