Florida showed robust population growth between July 1, 2013 and July 1, 2014, according to new numbers from the U.S. Census Bureau. The Villages, Florida, a retirement community just outside Orlando, was the country’s fastest-growing metro area during that time period, growing 5.4 percent.

Six of the 20 fastest-growing cities were in the Sunshine State. Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, metro Austin, Texas, and St. George, Utah, also ranked among the fastest growing.

NPR’s Marilyn Geewax told Here & Now’s Lisa Mullins that since the recession, Florida’s real estate market has been on the upswing, and the state is attracting retiring baby boomers. Florida recently surpassed New York as the third most populous state, behind California and Texas.

“Florida has a lot of people who die,” Geewax said. “About half of the counties report more deaths than births. So you really need to attract a lot of people to overcome the losses from those deaths – and they’re doing it.”
