PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WPRI) — This might be the year for people living without health insurance in Rhode Island to cave in and purchase it — because the fine for those without insurance is about to double.

There are only a few weeks left until open enrollment for 2016 closes for HealthSourceRI.

Officials say the percentage of uninsured Rhode Islanders has continuously dropped since President Obama launched his health care reform.

According to HealthSourceRI, only five percent of the state’s population is currently living without insurance.

“Healthcare is the law now, and in this state these increases were mandated,” said Maria Tocco, spokesperson for HealthSource RI.

In 2014 – when the Affordable Care Act was enacted – the penalty was $95 dollars for an adult or one percent of household income.

In 2015, it went up to $325, or two percent of income.

This year if you are uninsured, you’ll pay a whopping $695 dollars per adult, or two-and-a-half percent of your income – whichever figure is higher.

Some think that’s still less than they would pay for a year of coverage, but HealthSourceRI says residents could qualify for a discounted plan or free insurance through the Medicaid program.

“Because nine out of 10 of our customers last year qualified for financial help, there’s a very good chance that there’s a plan that’s good for you and your budget,” Tocco said.

The deadline to enroll is January 31.

Customers can renew their coverage online here, or over the phone by calling 1-855-840-4774.

To enroll or renew, customers should have these items on hand for all members of their family:

Last 4 weeks of pay stubs

Social Security numbers

Immigration documents

2014 Tax Return

An enrollment fair will be held Thursday at the Sheraton Hotel, 1850 Post Road, Warwick until 8 p.m. Representatives from all participating insurers will be available at the fair.
