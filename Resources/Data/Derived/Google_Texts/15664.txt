“Last Week Tonight” host John Oliver is advocating that sports teams stop using public funding to build extravagant stadiums.

Oliver cited the Miami Marlins, whose publicly-financed stadium includes an aquarium behind home plate.

Detroit spent $444 million to construct a new hockey arena in 2013—two-thirds of which was funded by taxpayers. Oliver noted that six days prior to the arena’s approval, the city of Detroit filed for bankruptcy.

“But teams get these deals because they know politicians will capitulate and give them whatever they want,” Oliver argued.

Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., has supported a deal concerning building a $500 million arena for the Milwaukee Bucks. Implications of the deal include raising taxes on hotel rooms in Milwaukee and rental cars. Walker said this deal is necessary by 2017, since the Milwaukee Bucks will be forced to relocate if a new stadium is not built.

“We have to come to our sense and stop signing these deals,” Oliver said later in the show.

Oliver then proceeded to give a locker room speech, imitating Coach Taylor from the television show “Friday Night Lights.”

“The next time a team comes around asking for a new stadium, I want you to make them pay,” Oliver said. He added, “Clear eyes, full hearts, can’t lose!”
