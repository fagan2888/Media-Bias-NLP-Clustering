Ted Cruz, the tea party Texan who brought the government to a standstill over Obamacare funding, is both symptom and cause of what ails the other party. Not that he dared utter Cruz\u2019s name on Lone Star soil, at least within earshot of reporters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a group that \u2014 and a few of them are from Texas, I\u2019ve got to admit \u2014 who just aren\u2019t willing to do the hard work and the compromise necessary to move the country forward,\u201d Obama said, drawing knowing laughter from the Democratic high rollers at the home of Peter and Lisa Kraus.\n\nThe powerhouse fundraisers hosted about 100 donors to the party\u2019s Senate campaign arm. Democrats aren\u2019t making a play as Sen. John Cornyn faces re-election next year. So the $15,000 per person collected at that reception and afterward, at a dinner hosted by lawyer Russell Budd, will go out of state, to help protect the party\u2019s 55-45 majority.\n\nLisa Kraus, introducing the president, referred to Cruz as part of a \u201creckless\u201d band of lawmakers who led a budget showdown meant to defund Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI want to personally thank you for standing up to this faction and for saying. \u2018No you can\u2019t. No you can\u2019t shut down the government because you don\u2019t like a law,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nObama echoed the view.\n\n\u201cThe shutdown cost this country money. It was bad for business. It was bad for families,\u201d he said. The threat of a federal debt default was even worse, and a very real possibility. Yet \u201caccording to at least one senator from Texas,\u201d he said \u2014 again referring to Cruz \u2014 the shutdown was a \u201cnecessity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a radical position. \u2026 It\u2019s a destructive position,\u201d Obama said.\n\nHaving mocked the president\u2019s trip as a \u201cbroken promises tour,\u201d Cruz wasn\u2019t about to let that slide.\n\nIn an email blast to potential donors, he took umbrage \u2014 and asked donors to kick in $25 to $250 to \u201chelp us stop Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the president was pushing the Obamacare train wreck and raising cash, he attacked our conservative efforts as \u2018radical\u2019 and \u2018destructive.\u2019 That\u2019s remarkable considering the president promised Americans they could keep their health care plans \u2014 which we now know is not true,\u201d Cruz wrote.\n\nObama also devoted part of his Dallas trip to pressuring Gov. Rick Perry to expand Medicaid, covering as many as 1.5 million uninsured Texans. He blamed Perry\u2019s ideology and \u201cbullheadedness\u201d for a decision that clearly, in his view, ignores the state\u2019s best interests.\n\nPerry was wholly uninterested in the advice and counsel, of which there was plenty.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a proud Democrat and am committed to the values that the Democratic Party represents, but I\u2019m also interested in getting the Republican Party back in a functioning state. Because this country has two parties, and we need both of them operating in a way that allows us to move forward,\u201d Obama said at the Kraus home.\n\nThe Cruz-inspired 16-day government shutdown left the GOP reeling and divided.\n\nBut Obama does seem sincere in that remarkably generous offer to help rebuild an opposition he had on the run just weeks ago.\n\nThat would explain the bungled rollout of Obamacare, and the contortions required by the White House to square those millions of cancellation notices with the president\u2019s oft-repeated promise that no one would lose insurance they liked, period.\n\nYes, Republicans, help is on the way.\n\nFollow Washington Bureau chief Todd J.
