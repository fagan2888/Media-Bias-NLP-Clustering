The hallways of my high school were papered with the American Library Association\u2019s \u201cRead\u201d posters, featuring pop stars posing cheerfully with their favorite books. Next to the lunchroom, there was Phil Collins grinning in a coonskin cap, a biography of Davy Crockett open before him. Could the man who sang \u201cSussudio\u201d really be wrong? And the faith in the power of a story well-told is ancient. Aristotle taught that narrative was therapeutic. More recently, revered writers like George Saunders and the late David Foster Wallace have talked about fiction\u2019s role as a bridge between existentially isolated individuals. Reading stories, Wallace said, \u201cwe become less alone inside.\u201d But reading fiction doesn\u2019t always make us better people. Ted Kaczynski was not improved by his obsession with Conrad\u2019s The Secret Agent, nor Timothy McVeigh by his fascination with The Turner Diaries. Mark David Chapman was not healed by his love of The Catcher in the Rye. The disturbed reader\u2014or, in my case, the merely immature reader\u2014won\u2019t always be ennobled simply by cracking open a great book.\n\nRelated Story Why You Never Truly Finish a Book I was a sophomore in college when I first read Walker Percy\u2019s The Moviegoer. You probably knew kids like me\u2014awkward, insecure students who latch onto a favorite book or a favorite band, identifying with and fashioning a self-image from someone else\u2019s creative act. In Binx Bolling, the troubled hero of The Moviegoer, I saw a model for the smart, droll young man I wanted to be. In fact, I was such a mess that I didn\u2019t notice what a mess Binx was. So I began reading The Moviegoer over and over again. I\u2019m still going today. I have, over the years, worn out at least three paperback editions of the book, breaking the spines, defacing the pages with what at the time seemed to be insightful notes. Because the novel is set in New Orleans in the run-up to Mardi Gras, I re-read it annually in the week immediately preceding Ash Wednesday. I read it in real time\u2014which is to say, that I read the sections of the book that take place on the Wednesday before Mardi Gras on that Wednesday, the Thursday sections on Thursday, and so on. If that routine strikes you as a little obsessive, maybe even unhinged, I won\u2019t bother arguing. I do it mainly because I think Binx would approve. Binx is an almost-30-year-old stockbroker making a project of \u201cliving the most ordinary life imaginable.\u201d For Binx, this means chasing secretaries, settling down in the suburban drabness of New Orleans\u2019s Gentilly neighborhood, and, most of all, going to the movies. Here\u2019s how he explains it: Other people, so I have read, treasure memorable moments in their lives: the time one climbed the Parthenon at sunrise, the summer night one met a lonely girl in Central Park and achieved with her a sweet and natural relationship, as they say in books. I too once met a girl in Central Park, but it is not much to remember. What I remember is the time John Wayne killed three men with a carbine as he was falling to the dusty street in Stagecoach, and the time the kitten found Orson Welles in the doorway in the The Third Man. Binx makes a kind of existential sport of moviegoing. He likes the wonder of finding himself in a moviehouse that he had visited years earlier, seeing the same sort of movie, during the same season. He calls it a repetition: \u201cA reenactment of past experience toward the end of isolating the time segment which has lapsed, in order that it, the lapsed time, can be savored of itself and without the usual adulteration of events that clog time like peanuts in brittle.\u201d I don\u2019t mean to suggest that 'The Moviegoer' corrupted me. But maybe it gave me permission to be the fuck-up I always thought I could be. So my serial re-reading is, in my mind, a kind of half-assed repetition, a nod to my hero Binx. How did he become my hero? In Binx, I saw a model for making my way in the world. He is a droll, cool camera-eye. Strolling past an aluminum rendering of the Holy Ghost at the local Catholic school, he launches into a reverie\u2014\u201cHow smooth and well-fitted and thrifty the aluminum feels!\u201d\u2014because he owns a few shares of Alcoa.\n\nIt\u2019s smartass Binx that first drew me to The Moviegoer. In his eccentric and acidly funny way, he can be awfully charming\u2014so charming that you might overlook how mentally unstable he is. I don\u2019t know how many times I had read the novel before it registered with me that Binx spends most of it in an insomniac fog, stumbling from one morally compromised position to another, dreading above all any kind of serious connection with the people around him. And when he does attempt a connection, it seems doomed. He finally proposes marriage to his suicidal cousin Kate, but even Kate seems to understand the proposal as an unfortunate gesture, a death-house prank. Writing in the New York Review of Books in 2005, Joyce Carol Oates identified Binx as one of a string of solitary, cool, self-absorbed males in American fiction\u2014other examples including Saul Bellow\u2019s Joseph from Dangling Man, and the narrator of Benjamin Kunkel\u2019s Indecision. I took Oates\u2019s critique as personally as if she had been questioning my own character. These were my role models she was writing so scathingly about. If they were cold, self-dramatizing narcissists, what was I? The short answer is that for many of the years I spent re-reading The Moviegoer, I was just as confused as Binx. I certainly aspired to be every bit as cool and every bit as noncommittal. It didn\u2019t work. It turned out to be a lousy strategy for, as the life coaches say, professional and interpersonal success. I took a Binxian approach to women, which is to say I told them lie after lie even as I assiduously pursued them. I turned my lunch hour at work into two or three hours of drinking, and I thought Binx would have been proud. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that The Moviegoer messed me up or corrupted me. But maybe it validated my impulse toward the passive and disconnected. It gave me permission to be the fuck-up I always thought I could be. My girlfriends, unimpressed with the literary influences behind my evasions and lies, dumped me. My bosses, with no use for an employee who disappeared for hours on end, fired me.\n\nRe-reading is essentially a childish act. Kids are serial re-readers. Kids want to return again and again to the world they find in a particular book, to try it on for size, to imagine themselves there, to take a few laps around their alternative world before returning home. Part of the fun is knowing you can make the trip anytime, as many times as you want, and always come back safe. One of the clich\u00e9s of literature is that one really can\u2019t read the same book twice. The idea is that with each re-reading, the reader brings new experiences, new insights, new emotional depth to the book, thus transforming it. But this credits readers with too much power and books with too little. Certain books have a way of stripping us of the emotional and intellectual armature that is commonly called maturity. One of my friends, for example, once told me that she never has been able to read Winnie the Pooh to her kids without crying. In the years since I first read The Moviegoer, I married, became a father, and learned some of the tricks we all learn for passing as an adult in an adult world. But reading The Moviegoer annually has given me an excuse to stay in contact with my 20-year-old self. Going back to Binx\u2019s New Orleans every year is, in fact, a little like going to a reunion: Binx and Kate and the various versions of me all getting together to check each other out and see who has thrived and who looks really bad. One of the things I looked for in The Moviegoer year after year was some clue to what happened to Binx and Kate. The novel ends ambiguously. Binx and Kate are supposed to marry and Binx is supposed to go to medical school. The plan is for them to live a good, simple life, to \u201cwalk abroad on a summer night \u2026 and see a show and eat some oysters down on Magazine.\u201d Have I kept reading it because it spoke to something in me that existed before I first read it? Or am I who I am now because I\u2019ve been reading 'The Moviegoer' all these years? But what really happens? I finally got an answer not from The Moviegoer but from another very good New Orleans novel, John Gregory Brown\u2019s Decorations in a Ruined Cemetery, from 1994. I\u2019d already been re-reading The Moviegoer for more than a decade when I got to Brown\u2019s book. And just as I was coming to the conclusion of Brown\u2019s novel, I got to a passage that just about knocked me out of my chair. A stockbroker-turned-doctor named Jack makes an appearance. Some things about Jack seem awfully familiar. Jack likes to go to the movies. Like Binx, he drives a tiny red sports car. Like Binx, he\u2019s a Korean War veteran who once lived in Gentilly. And did I mention that Jack is Binx\u2019s real name? There\u2019s not much mystery about it. It\u2019s Binx, of course, making a cameo appearance in Brown\u2019s novel.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Coming to the realization that loving a good book doesn&#39;t make you a good person", "author": "Andrew Santella", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Coming to the realization that loving a good book doesn&#39;t make you a good person", "title": "My Childish, Unhealthy, Joyous Obsession With The Moviegoer", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/03/4665300038_006de66a2f_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/03/my-childish-unhealthy-joyous-obsession-with-em-the-moviegoer-em/284255/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc293\"", "article_summary": "But reading The Moviegoer annually has given me an excuse to stay in contact with my 20-year-old self.\nRelated Story Why You Never Truly Finish a Book I was a sophomore in college when I first read Walker Percy\u2019s The Moviegoer.\nIn Binx Bolling, the troubled hero of The Moviegoer, I saw a model for the smart, droll young man I wanted to be.\nOr am I who I am now because I\u2019ve been reading 'The Moviegoer' all these years?\nOne of the things I looked for in The Moviegoer year after year was some clue to what happened to Binx and Kate."}
