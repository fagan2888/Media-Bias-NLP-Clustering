A new study out of the Eastern Kentucky University finds that unattractive men are more likely to be shunned by women if they \u201cmess up,\u201d whereas more attractive men are often protected from a ruined reputation by their good looks.\n\nThe study, led by Jeremy Gibson and Jonathan Gore, examines the way unattractiveness fosters a \u201cnegative bias\u201d toward the male from the opposite sex. They also wanted to discover how a faux pas, or a social/legal violation of some sort, would affect the female\u2019s perspective of the man \u2014 whether he was deemed handsome or homely.\n\n\u201cIn addition to unattractiveness, the violation of social norms has been known to act as a cue for this negative bias,\u201d the authors write in the abstract. Thus, they assumed that whether a man was attractive or ugly, violating social norms would paint either of them as a \u201cdevil\u201d and create a negative bias. They found, however, that a mess-up only cast a shadow on unattractive men.\n\nThe researchers examined responses of 170 college women who looked at two male faces, then were paired with written situations \u2014 one involved committing a social faux-pas, and the other didn\u2019t. It turns out that violating a social norm was considered way more off-putting when the man was unattractive \u2014 giving him a double negative bias. Handsome men, on the other hand, didn\u2019t experience as much of a negative bias when doing something wrong.\n\n\u201cThe unattractive male is tolerated up to a point; his unattractiveness is OK until he misbehaves,\u201d Gibson said in the press release.\n\nIn another recent study, researchers found that women were more likely to scorn an unattractive suitor after they were rejected by a more attractive male themselves. And Gibson and Gore believe that in a legal setting, unattractive people won\u2019t be released as easily as attractive ones.\n\n\u201cA man who stands trial has already shown himself to have violated social norms in one way or another,\u201d Gore said in the press release. \u201cIf he is also unattractive, the magnified devil effect may result in a larger fine or sentence, as it could influence how negatively jurors view him and, as a result, the degree to which they believe him guilty of the crime.\u201d\n\nSo do homely guys always get the short end of the stick? Not necessarily \u2014 especially if they're nice. While women may prefer the \"bad boys\" initially, they'll soon find that crying into their pillow every night isn't the definition of true, requited love and may search for a more stable, kind partner.\n\nSource: Gibson L, Gore J.
