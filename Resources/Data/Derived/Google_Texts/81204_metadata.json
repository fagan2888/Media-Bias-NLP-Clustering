We don\u2019t turn anyone away.\u201d\n\nKincade himself does the honors in the kitchen, serving meals Tuesdays through Fridays to anyone who might walk through the center\u2019s front door.\n\nMuch of what is served are leftovers donated by local restaurants, churches or individuals \u2014 healthy, nutritious food that otherwise would be going to waste.\n\nKincade picks up some of the items, with others brought to the center by volunteers.\n\nWhen he is inside the center, Kincade said he has trained his ear to listen for the honking of car horns. When he hears one, he said, he races out the front door to pick up whatever that person is dropping off.\n\n\u201cClothes go real fast,\u201d he said of items snatched up by visitors to the Christian Neighbor Center, located a half-block west of S. Kansas Avenue, directly south of the Arab Shrine Temple.\n\nThe Bootstrap Program, which provides housing for individuals seeking to turn their lives around by becoming gainfully employed, continues to be in operation at the center.\n\nBible studies, prayer meetings and church services are \u201cnearly every night of the week\u201d at the center\u2019s storefront chapel, 1405 S. Kansas Ave.\n\nHe said people know about the center and frequently drop off items that are left over from their garage sales.\n\nAll of the items are given away to others, and no one is charged for the items.\n\nSummer months find the Christian Neighbor Center holding barbecue dinners, and also occasional concerts featuring local Christian gospel musicians.\n\nThrough the relationships he has established during the years, Kincade has spread the word about the Christian Neighbor Center to local churches and individuals.\n\nYet, he said, there is room for so many more to help.\n\nA challenge these days is for the center to find new supporters, Kincade said.\n\n\u201cLots of our best supporters aren\u2019t with us anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cGod has called them home. Now, we need a new generation of supporters.\u201d\n\nKincade said he would welcome anyone to come and sit down with him over a cup of coffee so he can show what the Christian Neighbor Center is all about and the important work it continues to do in downtown Topeka some 60 years after it was founded by George Eutsler, an early leader of the Topeka Rescue Mission.\n\n\u201cGod\u2019s people are keeping us afloat,\u201d Kincade said. \u201cI don\u2019t depend on the government. I depend on God\u2019s people. We\u2019ve been keeping our head above water.\u201d\n\nAnyone wishing more information on the Christian Neighbor Center may call Kincade at (785) 608-5658.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Phil Anderson", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Local charities can count on a large amount of contributions coming into their coffers this time of year as people are in the holiday spirit of giving.", "title": "Center helps homeless in near obscurity", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2014-12-07/center-helps-homeless-near-obscurity", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/13914859.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Local charities can count on a large amount of contributions coming into their coffers this time of year as people are in the holiday spirit of giving.Their sense of urgency is accelerated by the fact that the end of the year is near, and donations made to nonprofits between now and Dec. 31 are eligible for tax deductions."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde6ff\"", "article_summary": "Summer months find the Christian Neighbor Center holding barbecue dinners, and also occasional concerts featuring local Christian gospel musicians.\nWe\u2019ve been keeping our head above water.\u201dAnyone wishing more information on the Christian Neighbor Center may call Kincade at (785) 608-5658.\nWhen he is inside the center, Kincade said he has trained his ear to listen for the honking of car horns.\n\u201cAll of the above,\u201d said James Kincade, 63, the longtime director of the Christian Neighbor Center.\nThrough the relationships he has established during the years, Kincade has spread the word about the Christian Neighbor Center to local churches and individuals."}
