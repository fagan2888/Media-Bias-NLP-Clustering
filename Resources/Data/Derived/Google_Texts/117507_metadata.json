Among that 56 percent is 55 percent of independents and more than 8 in 10 Republicans.\n\nA majority of Americans \u2013 53 percent \u2013 also disapprove of how President Barack Obama is handling the law\u2019s implementation overall. Moreover, just 46 percent of Americans support the law and its changes, with most of them believing the law goes too far.\n\nPresident Obama delivered a speech from the White House Rose Garden Monday morning to quash complaints about the website\u2019s problems.\n\n\u201cNobody is madder than me about the fact that the website isn\u2019t working as well as it should, which means it\u2019s going to get fixed,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIn the meantime, you can bypass the website.\u201d\n\n(No one probably told him, however, that the toll-free number set up for the program redirects Americans back to the Healthcare.gov website \u2026)\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney also attempted to do damage control Monday, attributing the site\u2019s problems to the overwhelming number of visits the site has received over the past three weeks.\n\n\u201cNo, in fact, I think it\u2019s absolutely accurate to say that the volume far exceeded our expectations and that the volume has driven the problems that we\u2019ve seen and exposed some of the problems that we now know about,\u201d Carney said.\n\nThe Washington Post/ABC News poll commissioned a telephone study of 1,002 adults nationwide from October 17-20, 2013.
