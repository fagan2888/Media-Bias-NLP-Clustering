Few people outside of Capitol Hill even know her name. And forget about knowing her political leanings or loyalties.\n\nBut she may very well be the most powerful person in Washington in determining how far Republicans can go in trying to repeal Obamacare.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs the Senate parliamentarian, MacDonough will make the decisions on which pieces of the law qualify to be repealed using a complicated budget procedure called reconciliation. Her decisions would allow Senate Republicans to vote to kill major provisions of the health care law under a simple 51-vote majority without giving Democrats a chance to filibuster.\n\nRepublicans have not yet decided whether to use reconciliation \u2014 and whether to use it for Obamacare or tax reform. MacDonough would have a pivotal role in either scenario.\n\nMacDonough started out as a Senate library clerk, moved up to become the \u201cassistant morning business editor to the Congressional Record\u201d and then, after law school, spent much of her working life in the nonpartisan parliamentarian office. She was named parliamentarian three years ago, the first woman to hold the position.\n\nThe parliamentarian is typically a little-known person \u2014 at most, MacDonough can sometimes be spotted on C-SPAN quietly advising the Senate\u2019s presiding officer. But when the post has become controversial in the past, it\u2019s often been over the thorny decisions around reconciliation.\n\nRepublicans protested decisions by then-parliamentarian Alan Frumin in the 2010 health care reform fight, when Democrats used the budget fast-track tool to pass a small part of the Affordable Care Act. In 2001, Republicans fired Robert Dove as parliamentarian after he ruled against them on how many reconciliation bills could be used. That was actually his second stint in the job: Democrats had fired Dove when they took the majority in 1987.\n\nMacDonough doesn\u2019t grant interviews or drop hints about how she might rule on Obamacare \u2014 or anything else, for that matter. Her tenure has been so free of controversy that many lawmakers interviewed said they didn\u2019t know much about her, or even her name.\n\nBut those who do know her \u2014 Democrats and Republicans \u2014 describe her as even-keeled, friendly, smart and willing to listen.\n\nSen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said parliamentarians \u2014 or \u201cparls,\u201d as they\u2019re known \u2014 have to make some tough calls that aren\u2019t always black and white. \u201cI think they do their best to use the facts and use the rules and follow the book,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s been around a long time, so she\u2019s very steeped in the traditions of the Senate and understands how it works here. If and when the time comes, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be ready to do her job.\u201d\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) had a similar assessment: \u201cI have no question about her ability to read the rules and make the right decisions.\u201d\n\nThose decisions are fought out in the so-called Byrd bath, the closed-door sessions when Republican and Democratic staff make their case to the parliamentarian about what goes in the bill and what stays out. It\u2019s named for former Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, who created the complicated system years ago.\n\nThat process could significantly raise MacDonough\u2019s profile if the Republicans use reconciliation for either tax reform or Obamacare. Both would be hugely controversial. President Barack Obama has repeatedly said he would veto any GOP bill that guts Obamacare.\n\nBut as Republicans consider reconciliation, they are also keeping an eye on 2016. They hope to win the White House then, and could go after the health care law in 2017 through reconciliation without a veto threat. Any decisions that MacDonough makes this year would set precedent for a second attempt at reconciliation two years from now.\n\n\u201cI think precedent of the past is going to dictate what gets in there, and the door is wide open right now,\u201d Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said.\n\nIn the majority, Senate Republicans can try to overrule her decisions. They can even remove her from the job if they want.\n\n\u201cI would hope and trust that her reputation is a straight shooter, because she is,\u201d Frumin said of MacDonough. \u201cShe\u2019s a nonpartisan professional. She listens. She\u2019s a very good listener. And she\u2019s very smart. And she will have possibly some difficult decisions to make, but she\u2019s absolutely the right person to do that.\u201d\n\nHe knows the pressures firsthand. He approved most of what the Democrats wanted in reconciliation in 2010. It contained only a small part of the much larger bill that is Obamacare, but it was pivotal to getting the whole health care law passed.\n\nFormer Sen. Judd Gregg, the top Republican on the Budget Committee at the time, blames Democrats for \u201cadulterating\u201d the reconciliation process and said Frumin was put in \u201can impossible situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfair to put on the shoulders of the parliamentarian the outcome of the most significant public-policy initiative the president had,\u201d he said.\n\nBut it\u2019s not impossible that MacDonough could find herself in a similar role. Frumin said pressure is part of the job.\n\n\u201cEvery generation or so this comes along,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is what the parliamentarian does.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Meet the most important person you don't know.", "title": "Obamacare's little secret", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/senate-parliamentarian-elizabeth-macdonough-obamacare-114274.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/01/14/20140128js_sotu22-macdonough-web.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Elizabeth MacDonough,Obamacare,Senate,Republicans,Senate parliamentarian,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Meet the most important person you don't know.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb3c6\"", "article_summary": "It contained only a small part of the much larger bill that is Obamacare, but it was pivotal to getting the whole health care law passed.\nThey hope to win the White House then, and could go after the health care law in 2017 through reconciliation without a veto threat.\nStory Continued BelowAs the Senate parliamentarian, MacDonough will make the decisions on which pieces of the law qualify to be repealed using a complicated budget procedure called reconciliation.\nIn the majority, Senate Republicans can try to overrule her decisions.\nBut when the post has become controversial in the past, it\u2019s often been over the thorny decisions around reconciliation."}
