A new poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 36 percent of Americans support policymakers building on existing law to improve healthcare affordability and access, while 24 percent want universal coverage through a single government plan.

In addition, 16 percent say they would like to see the Affordable Care Act repealed, while 13 percent want it to be replaced with a Republican-sponsored alternative.

The poll also showedthat putting certain labels on policies can skew public opinion, KFF President and CEO Drew Altman notes in a blog post for the Wall Street Journal. For example, when a single-payer system is referred to as "Medicare-for-all," 53 percent of Democrats have positive reactions; when it's called a "single payer health insurance system," just 21 percent of Democrats support the system.
