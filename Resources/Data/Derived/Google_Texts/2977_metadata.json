Terry initially pulled into the Walgreens parking lot at East Ajo Way and South 12th Avenue before throwing the vehicle into reverse and allegedly ramming several other vehicles, one of which was occupied, before squealing out of the parking lot, police say.\n\nWhile this was going on, according to TPD, three officers from the traffic stop -- later identified as Sgt. Brian Knight, a 13-year-veteran and Officer Michael Cuestas, a three-year veteran as well as an undercover officer -- were on foot in the parking lot and opened fire at the truck Terry was driving in an attempt to stop him. Instead, Terry allegedly reversed all the way out of the parking lot, got onto Ajo Way and collided with a vehicle in the intersection at 12th Avenue as he continued east toward South Sixth Avenue. There, he allegedly caused another collision of at least nine vehicles including a police cruiser. He tried to run away but was caught and transported to the hospital, initially with life-threatening injuries.\n\nHe was released late Saturday night and booked into the Pima County Jail for two outstanding warrants in addition to the following new charges:\n\nTwo counts of aggravated assault, a class 3 felony\n\nTwo counts of aggravated assault, a class 4 felony\n\nMisconduct involving weapons, a class 4 felony\n\nPossession of narcotic drugs for sale, a class 2 felony\n\nPossession of dangerous drugs for sale, a class 4 felony\n\nUnlawful flight from law enforcement officer, a class 5 felony\n\nThe investigation is ongoing, and police say additional charges may be added later.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
