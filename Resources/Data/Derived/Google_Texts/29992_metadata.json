(WHNT) \u2013 Every day, WHNT News 19 hears from people worried about huge premium increases.\n\nTuesday evening, State Representative Laura Hall will hold a town hall at the Richard Showers Center to help people in that situation.\n\nDoctors and civic leaders will be there to help people navigate the sign-up process of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nJust understanding those changes could save you hundreds, or even thousands of dollars per year.\n\nHere is one woman\u2019s story about how the changes brought by the Affordable Care Act affected her.\n\n\u201cI received this letter from Blue Cross Blue Shield today, informing me that my plan that I\u2019ve had for about a decade does not meet all the Affordable Care Act requirements,\u201d said Linda Ross, a Blue Cross customer.\n\nThe letter came with other materials from Blue Cross Blue Shield. More importantly, it came with a price tag and a sinking feeling.\n\n\u201cI will have a $340 a month increase above my $683 monthly premiums right now. My total cost for this plan is $ 1,023. That\u2019s double my mortgage payment,\u201d said Ross.\n\nThe materials from Blue Cross Blue Shield say they will auto-enroll Ross into the $1,000 plan. It\u2019s tough news to take when you\u2019re making ends meet.\n\n\u201cWhether I wanted to or not, I was going to have to make some changes,\u201d said Ross.\n\nBut with closer examination, those changes might come in the form of switching insurance.\n\nWHNT took action and directed Ross to www.healthcare.gov, where she looked up other comparable plans.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield says they\u2019ll stick Ross in a $1,000 silver tier plan that isn\u2019t eligible for government subsidy.\n\nBut looking on the marketplace, Ross found three other silver tier plans \u2013 all around $750, all eligible for subsidy.\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d said Ross.\n\nIt\u2019s all she could manage when looking through the other plans. At the end of the day, she could even pay less for her insurance than what she was paying before.\n\nIt\u2019s just a matter of being proactive and diligent.\n\nIn fact, most people who apply will qualify for lower costs based on their household size and income, according to healthcare.gov. The lower your income within the ranges shown in the chart to the right, the lower your premium costs will be.\n\nThough the process to apply online for coverage is still going through some updates to be fixed, everyone has the option to browse through the plans available in their respective state and county without signing up for anything. You don\u2019t even have to create an account!\n\nTo browse through plans and get an idea of what it available in your area, simply visit www.healthcare.gov and click \u201cSee Plans Now\u201d on the homepage. You will be directed to answer a few general questions about what kind of coverage you are looking for and where you live. No personal information is required to browse the plans and prices.\n\nThe coverage plans are put into five categories: catastrophic, bronze, silver, gold, and platinum, and are based on how you and the plan expect to share the costs for healthcare.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the prices shown once you answer the questions are pre-subsidy, meaning that most people who apply will pay lower premiums than what is actually shown. Households with yearly incomes up to about $46,000 for individuals or $94,000 for a family of 4 will qualify for lower costs.\n\nIf you enroll in coverage through the Healthcare Marketplace, coverage can begin on January 1. Open enrollment will end on March 31, 2014. As of October 22, there are 160 days left to enroll.", "article_metadata": {"description": "HUNTSVILLE, Ala.
