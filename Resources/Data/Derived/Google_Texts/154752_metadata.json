Because this drive, to the airport to catch the Nuggets\u2019 charter plane bound for San Francisco in advance of Saturday\u2019s game at Golden State, had extra meaning.\n\nThe second-year center boarded the plane with knowledge he was just hours away from making a long-anticipated season debut.\n\n\u201cI feel excited about everything,\u201d Nurkic said. \u201cI feel great. My shape right now is not right, but I want to play.\u201d\n\nThe final hurdle in a marathon, eight-month saga of rehabbing a partially torn left patellar tendon was getting through an entire practice. Nurkic needed to see himself do it. Nuggets coach Michael Malone needed to see him do it. Both parties were satisfied with what they saw.\n\n\u201cHe had a good practice,\u201d Malone said. \u201cToday was a big day for him. Seeing him out here, seeing him up-and-down, he\u2019ll definitely play (against Golden State). We\u2019ll monitor his minutes, make sure we don\u2019t overload him too much on his first game back. But it will be good to see him out there and get him back in the rotation.\u201d\n\nNurkic isn\u2019t the only returning player.\n\nDanilo Gallinari\u2019s hair gave him away. The veteran forward goes with a mohawk when he\u2019s ready to play, and after a bit more than a week of growth had filled it all in, there it was \u2014 sides freshly shaved. Gallo, ready to return.\n\nHe, too, went through all of Friday\u2019s practice. He\u2019ll be back in the starting lineup against the Warriors after missing six games with a sprained left ankle. And the Nuggets need him.\n\n\u201cGallo is our leading scorer, so it\u2019s always good to have him back,\u201d Nuggets guard Will Barton said. \u201cGives us some more scoring punch.\u201d\n\nGallinari averages 17.3 points per game, and getting back that production helps.\n\nThe Nuggets know they can get 20 points or more from Gallo most nights, and they desperately need that additional, reliable firepower.\n\n\u201c(He\u2019s) an attacking player,\u201d Malone said. \u201cA \u2018small\u2019 player that we can put in the post. He\u2019s one of our higher-volume post-up players. He\u2019s a guy that gets us to the foul line. He\u2019s a guy that generates free-throw attempts. He drives. You\u2019re getting back size, versatility and an offensive weapon in a guy that can score in a lot of different ways.\u201d\n\nWhile the wait to get Gallinari back seemed like a long time for everyone else, to him he\u2019s coming back in the blink of an eye.\n\n\u201cA week is great,\u201d Gallinari said. \u201cNineteen months without playing basketball (due to ACL rehab), trust me, a week is nothing. It\u2019s like one hour, maybe. I feel good, it was just a week. I\u2019m ready to go.\u201d\n\nGallinari said he\u2019s not pain-free but ready nonetheless.\n\nHe\u2019ll try to help the Nuggets snap a four-game losing streak against the defending champions.\n\n\u201cHow do we beat them? Well, we\u2019ve got to play for 48 minutes,\u201d Gallinari said. \u201cWe proved against everybody that when we play for 48 minutes, we give ourselves a good chance to win. We\u2019ve just got to do it for 48 minutes.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nDENVER AT GOLDEN STATE 8:30 p.m. Saturday, ALT; 104.3 FM\n\nSpotlight on Harrison Barnes:\n\nJust as the Nuggets are getting players back for Saturday\u2019s game against Golden State, the Warriors could also get the return of a key cog that has been missing for a while. Harrison Barnes has dealt with an ankle injury that has caused him to miss 15 consecutive games. Barnes is the fourth-leading scorer for the Warriors, averaging 13.4 points per game.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nNuggets:\n\nThis is the start of a back-to-back set for the Nuggets, who return home for a quick rematch against the Portland Trail Blazers. The Trail Blazers beat them Wednesday night in Portland. \u2026 The Nuggets are trying to snap a three-game road losing streak. \u2026 In the last three games, Kenneth Faried is averaging 14.0 points and 10.3 rebounds.\n\nWarriors:\n\nAn anticipated return isn\u2019t reserved just for Barnes. Star guard Stephen Curry has missed two straight games with a lower leg injury and could return against the Nuggets. Also, coach Steve Kerr, who has not been on the sideline all season because of complications from back surgery, is closing in on a return too. And his return could come against the Nuggets.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Danilo Gallinari, Jusuf Nurkic to return", "title": "Danilo Gallinari, Jusuf Nurkic to return", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/01/danilo-gallinari-jusuf-nurkic-to-return/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160101__BN20160102_Z00_BNSP02BKNNUGGETSp1.jpg", "height": 469}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160101__BN20160102_Z00_BNSP02BKNNUGGETSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-01T21:10:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T22:07:18+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Seeing him out here, seeing him up-and-down, he\u2019ll definitely play (against Golden State).\nStar guard Stephen Curry has missed two straight games with a lower leg injury and could return against the Nuggets.\nFriday afternoon, Jusuf Nurkic walked out of the Pepsi Center toward his car with a little extra bounce in his step.\nBecause this drive, to the airport to catch the Nuggets\u2019 charter plane bound for San Francisco in advance of Saturday\u2019s game at Golden State, had extra meaning.\nNOTEBOOKNuggets:This is the start of a back-to-back set for the Nuggets, who return home for a quick rematch against the Portland Trail Blazers."}
