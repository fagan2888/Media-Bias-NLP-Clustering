It\u2019s a benefit for patients, who can also access written estimate of their out-of-pocket costs for scheduled or planned inpatient and outpatient medical procedures.\n\nAnd Virginia Mason, with 460 physicians, seven medical centers and a 336-bed urban hospital, can lay claim to having some of the lowest hospital prices in the state. The health system has the lowest hospital prices by admission type in greater Seattle and prices 25 percent lower than the statewide average, according to a recent Washington Health Alliance study.\n\nAt the same time, the nature of healthcare reimbursement and insurance currently means that patients looking for an exact price check on Virginia Mason\u2019s site have to do some additional investigation \u2014 about what kind of facility they\u2019re visiting and their health plan details.\n\n\u201cYour actual financial responsibility will likely vary greatly from the estimated price,\u201d Virginia Mason\u2019s price estimator notes.\n\n\u201cWhen the 100 procedures listed below and certain other outpatient services and procedures are performed in these hospital-based facilities, you (or your insurer) will be charged a hospital facility charge in addition to a professional (physician) charge.\u201d If those same services are received at one of Virginia Mason\u2019s outpatient clinics, the hospital facility fee won\u2019t be levied, although \u201cother facility charges may apply.\u201d And, the disclosure notes, \u201cthe insurance company will decide the amount you are responsible for paying.\u201d\n\nThus are the challenges for health systems trying to meet demand from consumers on high deductible plans \u2014 a price estimate if not a guaranteed price. Still, healthcare organizations in progressive regions like the Puget Sound are pushing ahead.\n\n[See also: Healthcare price transparency becomes reality in Massachusetts.]\n\nLast year, the Everett Clinic became the Pacific Northwest\u2019s first health system to post prices online for its most frequently used procedures, from blood tests and advanced imaging to anticoagulation therapy and dialysis. The prices show the self-pay rates, what would be charged without any adjustments by a health plan, as well as the 25 percent discount rate for prompt payment.\n\nHowever, healthcare providers, payers and regulators in Washington State are, as elsewhere, still not in total agreement about the best ways to bring consumers transparency.\n\n\u201cI can shop for anything online, books and raisins, and know the price. The biggest battle we have in our area is the people who want to keep that secret,\u201d said Ron Sims, board chair of the state insurance exchange and former King County, Washington chief executive, in a presentation at the Maine Health Management Coalition last year.\n\nSims was describing the failed efforts to create what would have been the nation\u2019s 14th all payer claims database, requiring Washington insurers to disclose and publicize their rates for hospitals and physicians. While state regulators, hospitals and consumer advocates supported the creation of the database, the state\u2019s largest insurer, Premera Blue Cross, argued that disclosing negotiated rates would not give consumers actionable information and would create new administrative burdens.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/virginia-mason-tries-embrace-price-transparency", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202015-04-06%20at%209.28.46%20AM_0.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "A regional health system in the Pacific Northwest is taking a major step towards price transparency, but there are still caveats for patients managing their own healthcare costs.", "title": "Virginia Mason tries to embrace price transparency"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Screen%20Shot%202015-04-06%20at%209.28.46%20AM_0.png"}, "description": "A regional health system in the Pacific Northwest is taking a major step towards price transparency, but there are still caveats for patients managing their own healthcare costs.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Virginia Mason tries to embrace price transparency"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A regional health system in the Pacific Northwest is taking a major step towards price transparency, but there are still caveats for patients managing their own healthcare costs.&#13; Seattle\u2019s Virginia Mason Medical Center is now disclosing estimated prices for its 100 most common outpatient surgical procedures, and posting it for the public online.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe14a6\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYour actual financial responsibility will likely vary greatly from the estimated price,\u201d Virginia Mason\u2019s price estimator notes.\nVirginia Mason's price estimator.\n[See also: Healthcare price transparency becomes reality in Massachusetts.]\nSeattle\u2019s Virginia Mason Medical Center is now disclosing estimated prices for its 100 most common outpatient surgical procedures, and posting it for the public online.\nAnd Virginia Mason, with 460 physicians, seven medical centers and a 336-bed urban hospital, can lay claim to having some of the lowest hospital prices in the state."}
