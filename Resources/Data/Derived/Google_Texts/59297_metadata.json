Mike Pence on Wednesday signed Indiana\u2019s plan to reduce energy usage, which will allow major utility companies to develop their own energy-efficiency programs and charge customers to implement them.\n\nThe measure acts as a replacement for Energizing Indiana, the previous statewide initiative that provided utility consumers with low-income home weatherization, free in-home energy audits and other services.\n\nThe proposal has been largely criticized by opponents and environmentalists, who question whether utilities, which sell electricity, should be in charge of programs that reduce their own sales.\n\n\u201cThe utility makes money selling energy and now they\u2019re in charge of reducing energy,\u201d said Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, who opposed the bill. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nEnergy-efficiency programs typically require companies to meet specific energy-reduction goals within a set time frame. To meet requirements, utilities can implement certain programs that help businesses to cut waste and homeowners to improve the efficiency of their homes.\n\nJodi Perras, director of the Sierra Club\u2019s Beyond Coal campaign in Indiana, said programs can include home energy audits, where light bulbs, shower heads and water pipes are replaced. Companies can also offer rebates for buying a more efficient furnace or kitchen appliance.\n\nEnergizing Indiana, which offered many of those services, was eliminated by lawmakers last year after large industrial and commercial customers complained that the program provided them with few benefits, was too costly to run and set unrealistic goals.\n\nRepublican Sen. Jim Merritt of Indianapolis said the \u201cgoal of Energizing Indiana was admirable, but it wasn\u2019t achievable,\u201d and a more realistic approach was needed.\n\nHowever, lawmakers will probably need to revise the new law in as little as three years to further adapt to federal requirements, Merritt said.\n\nThe new initiative allows a utility company to create energy-efficiency plans at least every three years based on what it believes is reasonable. The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission has the final say on whether the programs and goals - if any are set - are appropriate.\n\nExperts say any effort toward energy efficiency is a positive for Indiana but contend the bill lacks basic elements necessary for such programs to be successful.\n\nRebecca Stanfield, the Midwest deputy director for policy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said an effective program should have solid targets that utilities must meet and also require utilities to use programs that are more cost effective than building another plant.\n\n\u201cThose are two really critical elements,\u201d Stanfield said. \u201cIndiana\u2019s plan has neither.\u201d\n\nOther states such as Arizona, Utah and Kansas have seen significant results with programs that hold utilities accountable with stricter requirements.\n\nAn Arizona policy adopted in 2010 set specific goals that regulated electric utilities must meet. Since then, Arizona climbed from the 29th to the 15th most energy-efficient state in the country, and ratepayers are projected to save billions by 2030, according to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.\n\nBut financial incentives, given to utility companies to help make up for a reduction in sales and revenue, could prevent Indiana consumers from seeing much savings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate issue to make sure they can reduce energy but still maintain financial health,\u201d Stanfield said. But she contended that Indiana\u2019s law \u201cpits utilities against their customers.\u201d\n\nA provision in the law allows utilities to charge customers for \u201clost revenue,\u201d or the electricity they do not sell when consumers or businesses opt for more efficient options.\n\nPierce said most states that allow this type of incentive cap the recovery period to a short time frame, but there\u2019s almost no limit on the amount Indiana\u2019s utilities can recover.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine this resulting in very much savings,\u201d Stanfield said.\n\nPence last week didn\u2019t directly answer questions of how the mechanism would save ratepayers money when utility companies will be allowed to charge consumers in a virtually uncapped way.\n\n\u201cI do believe in my heart that in the long term, by having policy that promotes energy efficiency in the state of Indiana, it\u2019s going to be a win for Hoosiers, for Hoosier ratepayers and Hoosier businesses,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new law aimed at decreasing energy usage in Indiana might not save consumers money as advertised and could leave the state at risk of violating federal emissions rules, environmentalists say.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/10/savings-from-indiana-energy-efficiency-law-could-b/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A new law aimed at decreasing energy usage in Indiana might not save consumers money as advertised and could leave the state at risk of violating federal emissions rules, environmentalists say.", "title": "Savings from Indiana energy-efficiency law could be small"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new law aimed at decreasing energy usage in Indiana might not save consumers money as advertised and could leave the state at risk of violating federal emissions rules, environmentalists say.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Savings from Indiana energy-efficiency law could be small"}, "Author": "LAURYN SCHROEDER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce31b\"", "article_summary": "But financial incentives, given to utility companies to help make up for a reduction in sales and revenue, could prevent Indiana consumers from seeing much savings.\nThe Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission has the final say on whether the programs and goals - if any are set - are appropriate.\nThe measure acts as a replacement for Energizing Indiana, the previous statewide initiative that provided utility consumers with low-income home weatherization, free in-home energy audits and other services.\nMike Pence on Wednesday signed Indiana\u2019s plan to reduce energy usage, which will allow major utility companies to develop their own energy-efficiency programs and charge customers to implement them.\nPence last week didn\u2019t directly answer questions of how the mechanism would save ratepayers money when utility companies will be allowed to charge consumers in a virtually uncapped way."}
