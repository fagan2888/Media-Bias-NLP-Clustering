He\u2019s apparently very well-liked by his students: many staged an elaborate rally on his behalf. According to WBZ-TV:\n\n\u201cAs soon as I heard I was in tears. It was so devastating to find out that such a beloved teacher could have been taken away from us in that way,\u201d says student Maya Sekhar. An unconventional teacher, Chen has been out of the classroom for a couple of weeks. He was overheard using the longer version of the phrase \u201cBS\u201d in an after-hours conversation with high school students. If there\u2019s more to it nobody is saying because of confidentiality.\n\nI called the school to ask for comment, and emailed the principal and vice principal. I also emailed Chen. No one responded immediately; I\u2019ll update this story if I hear back.\n\nIt\u2019s possible Chen did something else wrong\u2014something very serious\u2014and deserves to be fired. But he certainly shouldn\u2019t be let go for using very mildly inappropriate language on a single occasion.\n\nChen\u2019s case calls to mind Louisiana State University Professor Teresa Buchanan, who was fired a few months ago for infrequently using coarse language and telling sexual jokes to her students. There was an update to this story today: LSU\u2019s faculty voted to censure the administrators who fired Buchanan, the university president among them. They content that LSU trampled Buchanan\u2019s rights and had no reason to fire her.\n\nChen also seems to be getting some moral support\u2014his union\u2019s president told local reporters that teachers should be allowed \u201cto bring their very special and rich talents\u201d into the classroom. I say good luck to Chen. His situation certainly seems like bullshit to me.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Schools have lost their minds", "title": "This Awesome Teacher Could Lose His Job For Saying \u2018Bullshit.\u2019 Why That\u2019s Bullshit.", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/10/07/this-awesome-teacher-could-lose-his-job", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14442528564176.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Schools have lost their minds", "title": "This Awesome Teacher Could Lose His Job For Saying \u2018Bullshit.\u2019 Why That\u2019s Bullshit.", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14442528564176.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-10-07T21:27:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb518\"", "article_summary": "A Brookline, Massachusetts, middle school teacher has been suspended from his job\u2014and might get fired\u2014because he was overheard uttering the word, \u201cbullshit.\u201d Frankly, that is bullshit.\nAn unconventional teacher, Chen has been out of the classroom for a couple of weeks.\nHe was overheard using the longer version of the phrase \u201cBS\u201d in an after-hours conversation with high school students.\nThere was an update to this story today: LSU\u2019s faculty voted to censure the administrators who fired Buchanan, the university president among them.\nI called the school to ask for comment, and emailed the principal and vice principal."}
