And why do you think they have this misconception?\n\nJEFFREY BALL: The single biggest misconception people have about renewable energy in the U.S. is that it\u2019s an all-or-nothing proposition. The misconception exists because renewable energy, like most aspects of energy, is caricatured by ideologues on both sides.\n\nPartisans on the left often talk of renewable energy as a panacea. If only the nation spent more money on renewable energy, they suggest, renewable energy could replace coal and oil. Partisans on the right often suggest renewable energy is a farce. They paint solar, wind and other renewable energy sources as profligate green dreams that do little but divert the nation\u2019s focus on serious energy: fossil fuels and nuclear power.\n\nBoth extremes miss the reality, which is in the middle.\n\nRenewable energy is making major progress: Its cost is falling, its reliability is increasing, and, both in the U.S. and around much of the world, it is growing fast. Perhaps the biggest sign of that growth is that, across the U.S. and globally, renewable energy is causing political and economic fights between established energy players and upstarts. The fights are erupting because the economic stakes are large.\n\nYet renewable energy faces major barriers. In most places it remains more expensive than fossil-fueled power, a cost hurdle reinforced by America\u2019s bounty of cheap natural gas. Moreover, the two energy sources that most people think of when they think of \u201crenewable energy\u201d\u2013solar and wind power\u2013are variable; when the sun isn\u2019t shining or the wind isn\u2019t blowing, they typically need fossil fuel to back them up. For all their feverish growth over the past few years, solar and wind power together still provide less than 2% of U.S. electricity.\n\nThe bottom line on renewable energy is this: It\u2019s a small but growing piece of a massive energy pie.\n\nJeffrey Ball (@jeff_ball), formerly The Wall Street Journal\u2019s environment editor and a longtime energy reporter at the paper, is scholar-in-residence at Stanford University\u2019s Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance, a joint initiative of Stanford\u2019s law and business schools. He writes about energy and heads a project exploring the relationships among countries in the globalizing clean-energy industry.\n\nRead the related article.\n\nRead the latest Energy Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The single biggest misconception people have about renewable energy in the U.S. is that it's an all-or-nothing proposition.", "title": "Both Sides Have It Wrong About Renewable Energy", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/09/23/both-sides-have-it-wrong-about-renewable-energy/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "US", "article.headline": "Both Sides Have It Wrong About Renewable Energy", "description": "The single biggest misconception people have about renewable energy in the U.S. is that it's an all-or-nothing proposition.", "article_section": "US", "author": "Charlie Wells", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "The Experts Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "The Experts", "article.summary": "The single biggest misconception people have about renewable energy in the U.S. is that it's an all-or-nothing proposition.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-23T18:11:49-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-210", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/09/23/both-sides-have-it-wrong-about-renewable-energy/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-258B-912", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "US", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The single biggest misconception people have about renewable energy in the U.S. is that it's an all-or-nothing proposition.", "title": "Both Sides Have It Wrong About Renewable Energy", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/experts/2013/09/23/both-sides-have-it-wrong-about-renewable-energy/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Experts", "article.id": "BL-258B-912", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-23T21:45:11-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8568\"", "article_summary": "If only the nation spent more money on renewable energy, they suggest, renewable energy could replace coal and oil.\nThe misconception exists because renewable energy, like most aspects of energy, is caricatured by ideologues on both sides.\nThe bottom line on renewable energy is this: It\u2019s a small but growing piece of a massive energy pie.\nJEFFREY BALL: The single biggest misconception people have about renewable energy in the U.S. is that it\u2019s an all-or-nothing proposition.\nThey paint solar, wind and other renewable energy sources as profligate green dreams that do little but divert the nation\u2019s focus on serious energy: fossil fuels and nuclear power."}
