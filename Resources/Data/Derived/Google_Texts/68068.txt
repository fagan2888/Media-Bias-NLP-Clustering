DENVER -- It's been more than a month since a Denver officer was hit by an out-of-control driver during an East High School protest march down Colfax.

That officer is still in the hospital. He was on a bicycle and dragged underneath the vehicle. The driver says he had a medical condition that caused him to lose control of his car.

In Justin Joseph's video report, we learn police say the driver is no longer cooperating with their investigation.
