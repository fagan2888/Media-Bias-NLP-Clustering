In the past, the district has found most of the teachers it needed locally. But this year, Valles will be looking outside the county, so he\u2019s updating his recruiting plan and materials. And he\u2019s moving a job fair from April to March to get a head start on competing districts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to attend a lot more teacher recruitment fairs than we have in the past, not just at local universities,\u201d Valles said. \u201cWe may have to go down to San Diego or up to San Jose.\u201d\n\nOther districts, such as Ojai Unified, where enrollment is declining, are less affected by the shortage. Ojai isn\u2019t having trouble finding elementary school teachers, said Superintendent Hank Bangser. But they\u2019re still dealing with ongoing shortages of science, math and special education teachers. That\u2019s partly because teachers who had been working in special education are moving into traditional classrooms, now that positions are opening up. And math and science majors can find more lucrative jobs than teaching.\n\n\u201cIf you have a bent toward math or science, the opportunities out there in the corporate world and related fields are, quite frankly, broader, more enticing and have higher compensation levels,\u201d Bangser said.\n\nThe issue goes beyond simply having enough teacher candidates, said Jason Peplinski, superintendent of the Simi Valley Unified School District, where enrollment is bouncing back after declining for years. It\u2019s finding strong candidates, especially in fields like computer science where there aren\u2019t enough of them.\n\nLike Ojai, Simi Valley gets plenty of applicants for elementary school teachers, Peplinski said. So they can choose the strongest candidates. But difficulties can arise when districts hoping to hire a science teacher, for example, get only five applicants.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just finding someone with a credential, it\u2019s finding someone excellent with a credential,\u201d Peplinski said. \u201cDo you have the right people applying?\u201d\n\nThe shortage started when fewer people enrolled in teacher credential programs during the recession, many of them fearing they wouldn\u2019t get a job after they graduated.\n\nOverall, California teaching programs saw enrollment drop by about half over the past five years. California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks had a similar drop, falling by nearly half over seven years between 2006 and 2013 \u2014 from 345 to 183 students. Since then enrollment has stabilized, but the drop means fewer beginning teachers entered the pipeline recently.\n\n\u201cPeople weren\u2019t going into teaching when we had the recession,\u201d Valles said.\n\nMaricela Vargas, now teaching kindergarten at Emilie Ritchen School in Oxnard, was earning her credential at CSU Channel Islands in Camarillo during the recession.\n\n\u201cI was thinking to myself, \u2018Why are so many teachers being laid off?\u2019 \u201d Vargas said. \u201cBut I decided this is what I want to do. I\u2019m going to continue my education.\u201d\n\nAt the same time that enrollment in teacher programs was dropping, many districts were offering older teachers retirement incentives, trimming their expenses but also contributing to the current shortage.\n\nOther factors may have scared off potential teachers, too. Some politicians want tenure to be eliminated, saying it allows incompetent teachers to stay in the classroom. Others have called for teachers to be evaluated based on students\u2019 test scores.\n\nAnd pay can be an issue in areas that are expensive to live, like Ventura County.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve made this huge investment in college, you\u2019ve got debt, and then you take a job that pays $35,000,\u201d Mantooth said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to pay rent on an apartment, pay your loans and have a life.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, the county is at something of an advantage precisely because it\u2019s a desirable place to live, Peplinski said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more expensive to live in Ventura County, but the schools are also more desirable,\u201d Peplinski said. \u201cThe candidates themselves are going to have their pick.\u201d\n\nTeacher shortages are nothing new, tending to come and go in cycles. Part of the blame lies with the way the state funds schools, Mantooth said. Schools get a guaranteed percentage of the state\u2019s overall pie, so when the economy is thriving, there\u2019s enough money to hire new teachers. But when a recession hits, districts have to lay those new teachers off, and fewer people enter the profession.\n\nThe governor\u2019s rainy day fund, which puts money into a reserve, will help, Mantooth said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of if \u2014 it\u2019s a question of when \u2014 we\u2019ll have the next recession,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we have a robust reserve, we may not have to cut as draconically.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"title": "Having laid off teachers, school districts now face a shortage", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/education/schoolwatch/having-laid-off-teachers-school-districts-now-face-a-shortage-ep-1358326728-347832411.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/teachershortage1_26441700_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 426}, "type": "article", "description": "In the recession, districts laid off teachers, but now they don't have enough.", "title": "Having laid off teachers, school districts now face a shortage"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/teachershortage1_26441700_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "In the recession, districts laid off teachers, but now they don't have enough.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Having laid off teachers, school districts now face a shortage"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8c0\"", "article_summary": "Like Ojai, Simi Valley gets plenty of applicants for elementary school teachers, Peplinski said.\nOjai isn\u2019t having trouble finding elementary school teachers, said Superintendent Hank Bangser.\nBut difficulties can arise when districts hoping to hire a science teacher, for example, get only five applicants.\n\u201cMy concern is having an adequate pool of quality teachers.\u201dThe Oxnard Union High School District, which is growing, anticipates it will need to hire 90 school teachers for next school year, said Rocky Valles, assistant superintendent of human resources.\nAnd pay can be an issue in areas that are expensive to live, like Ventura County."}
