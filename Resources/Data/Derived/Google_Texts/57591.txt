Defense, pitching, timely hitting keys win against Thunder Academy

BOULDER — The Longmont/Erie baseball club has been there ... they just haven't done that.

Coaches Tom Fobes and Harold Simmons were all too familiar with playing in the quarterfinals of the Boulder NIT at Scott Carpenter Park, even down to the predicted summer rain that has marked each appearance.

But breaking through to Sunday's semifinals has been a tough hurdle to clear. On Saturday, they finally did with a 7-5 win over the Broomfield-based Thunder Academy.

"It feels good, it feels really good," said Simmons, the Erie head coach, who got a strong performance on the mound from his very own Caleb Crites. "We have been here for the past four or five years with this group and typically with an older group than this.

"So to get over the hump and do it with a younger team is really nice and is good for these guys."

After jumping out to a 1-0 lead in the top of the first thanks to a two-out rally and an RBI double from Miguel Moroyoqui, the Trogers — as in the Trojans and Tigers — got a big boost with a defensive gem in the bottom half.

It was again Moroyoqui who fielded a base hit from Thunder Academy's Kyle Leahy (ironically, an Erie player) and came up firing to catcher Nic Ogimachi to nail Javis Larson at the plate.

"I saw the runner coming home so I didn't have (first baseman Ryan Rulon) catch it," Ogimachi said. "I caught and turned to try and get something and got him on the leg. That felt good."

Longmont/Erie was up 2-1 in the fourth when Ogimachi transferred his good feelings defensively to the offensive side. With Avery Peterson on second base after a leadoff single and wild pitch, Ogimachi squared up a letter-high 1-2 pitch from Patrick Kline and drove it well over the left-center field wall.

"I just kind of sat back with the curve and he threw it," Ogimachi said. "And when I hit it I thought maybe it's going, maybe not."

The Trogers got a fortunate break in the fifth, manufacturing a run with a well-timed double steal that allowed Cooper Rothe to come home. Ogimachi made it 6-1 when he drove in Zane Begano to cap his 3 for 4 game with his third run batted in.

It was all the offense Caleb Crites would need. The Erie starter gave up eight hits and five runs, but never allowed Thunder Academy to string anything together. He got out of a bases loaded jam in the bottom of the sixth inning, getting Fairview's Tobiah Armstrong to ground out to second base.

"The defense totally backed me up," Crites said. "I could not have done it without them, they made some extraordinary plays."

Earlier Saturday, 5280 Victorium and Slammers North advanced to Sunday's semifinals, which will be played at 9 a.m. and noon with the championship to follow at 3 p.m. at Scott Carpenter.
