Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, allowing the U.S. military to relocate and intern Japanese-Americans during World War II, in the wake of the Pearl Harbor bombing. It took 36 more years before President Gerald Ford officially rescinded the order, calling its signing \u201ca sad day\u201d in American history and blaming it on xenophobia, prejudice and fear. Today, the day after a speech warning against blaming all Muslims for the actions of extremists, President Barack Obama hits Chicago and designates several national monuments, including a former internment camp in his native Hawaii. Here\u2019s your Three-Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in 180 seconds or less:\n\nHope We Get Change: A new Quinnipiac poll shows voters in several presidential swing states are going thumbs-down on Obama\u2019s plan to make community college free for everyone; on its face, not a big deal given it\u2019s probably a non-starter with Congress. But consider: seven years ago, then-Sen. Barack Obama could do little wrong as swept through Iowa, Virginia and Colorado on his way to the presidency, the same states that are booing the college plan. Not a good sign for Hillary Clinton, who (if she runs) likely would have to find a way to refute the argument that she represents Obama\u2019s third term.\n\nWords Matter: During his keynote speech at the White House-convened Summit to Combat Violent Extremism, Obama went out of his way to declare the ongoing fight in the Middle East isn\u2019t against Islam but against people who have perverted that religion \u2013 a description that mirrors his refusal to use \u201cIslamic extremists\u201d to characterize the enemy, despite withering criticism from the right. But the president apparently is calculating that, by removing religion from the equation, he can redefine the war.\n\nNo Mas: Sen. Marco Rubio on Wednesday become the latest Republican to break ranks with GOP leadership and declare that the Senate should pass a clean funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security when the winter recess ends next week. The Republicans have tried three times to avoid a partial shutdown by linking DHS funding to a full repeal of Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration, but Democrats have blocked it, objecting to the tactic. Speaking in Las Vegas Wednesday, Rubio said the stalemate isn\u2019t helping anyone, especially tied to a bill Obama\u2019s probably going to veto anyway.\n\nSee You in Court \u2013 Or Not: Of course, the whole \u201cwe\u2019ll fund DHS if it kills the immigration action\u201d thing could become moot after a Texas judge issued an injunction blocking it from taking effect. Yet the Guardian corralled a passel of legal experts who doubt the case has legs. That\u2019s because there\u2019s a lot of precedent for Obama\u2019s executive action, and federal courts tend to side with the White House in similar matters. And the basis for the Texas\u2019 judge\u2019s action \u2013 that Obama didn\u2019t enter the action in the federal register, or allow time for public comment \u2013 is easily fixed.\n\nUnmanned Aerial Economics: U.S. News\u2019 Paul D. Shinkman reports that the Obama administration\u2019s decision to sell drone technology to U.S. allies, announced Tuesday, could be considered a classic case of supply and demand: After supplying European allies with missile-equipped drones, the White House will politely demand that said allies use the high-tech hardware on violent extremists, who are a lot closer Over There. In the process, the sales effectively lock down what\u2019s become a highly competitive, potentially lucrative market for American manufacturers. Then\u2026 money fight!!\n\nAll You Need Is Love (and a Flag): After sparring with Obama over the president\u2019s critique of police officers last summer, Rudy Giuliani kicked things up a notch when he took the floor at the so-called Fox News primary, held in Manhattan\u2019s tony \u201c21 Club\u201d Wednesday night. Giuliani said Obama doesn\u2019t love America, not even platonically: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t love you. And he doesn\u2019t love me. He wasn\u2019t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country.\u201d Giuliani, however, declined to say how he came to that conclusion, although he seemed to indicate it\u2019s better America finds out about it now before its six-year relationship with Obama goes any further.\n\nGlass Ceiling Ahead: Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO and failed 2012 California Senate candidate, is making a move to semi-officially join the Republican 2016 Presidential Super Val-U-Pak (now with 25 percent less Christie!) as early as April, when she goes on tour with \u2013 what else? \u2013 a campaign book. If she decides to jump in, Fiorina would be the GOP\u2019s first and only woman to run for the nomination this cycle, and she\u2019s already figured out a niche: appealing to Republican women, and the only member of the pack who can criticize Hillary Clinton without sounding like a sexist clod (looking at you, Rand Paul).\n\nCounting Demon Sheep: The news about Fiorina gives us another excuse to play what has got to be one of the best bad campaign ads ever, from her 2012 Republican Senate primary in California:\n\nTweet of the Morning:\n\nAs the proud grandpa of a transgender grandchild, I hope she can feel safe at school without fear of being bullied. pic.twitter.com/NDIfOdW9sk \u2014 Rep.
