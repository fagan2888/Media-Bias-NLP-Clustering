TMZ tracked down 2016 GOP candidate Marco Rubio to ask him about the latest death gripping the country, the killing of Cecil the Lion.

But the Florida senator said that Americans should be more “fired up” over new videos released in recent weeks showing Planned Parenthood’s practice of selling fetal tissue, Mediaite reported.

“I know the country’s been in an uproar about Cecil the tiger [sic],” TMZ’s reporter said to Mr. Rubio, according to video of the encounter posted by the magazine. “A lot of people have different takes on it. How do you feel about that?”

“I don’t know a lot about this story. Obviously there’s laws in that country, so whatever the laws there were, that guy should have followed them,” Mr. Rubio said, referring to American dentist Walter Palmer who admitted to killing the famous lion in Zimbabwe.

“But you know, everyone’s fired up about this tiger — or this lion — people should be more fired up about these babies that are coming out of the Planned Parenthood videos,” Mr. Rubio said. “If people are going to be outraged about an animal being killed, they should also be outraged about a human being being killed. …”

Mr. Rubio echoed previous comments he made on the issue on Twitter.

“Look at all this outrage over a dead lion, but where is all the outrage over the planned parenthood dead babies,” he tweeted Wednesday.
