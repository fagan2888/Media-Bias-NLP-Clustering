So to hold an outright majority of 51 percent in parliament, the NLD has to win more than two-thirds of the seats contested.\n\nSEATS IN PARLIAMENT\n\nThere are 440 seats in the lower house. 110 of them are reserved for the military.\n\nThere are 224 seats in the upper House. 56 of them are reserved for the military.\n\nThere are also 14 legislatures for the regions and states of Myanmar.\n\nPRESIDENCY\n\nMyanmar's president is elected by parliament, not by popular vote.\n\nThe upper house, the lower house, and the military bloc in parliament put forward one presidential candidate each. The combined houses votes on the three candidates. The presidential candidates do not have to be elected members of parliament.\n\nThe winner becomes president and forms a government, the losers become vice presidents with largely ceremonial responsibilities.\n\nThe vote on the presidency will take place after the new members take their seats in both houses in February. The president will assume power by the end of March.\n\nCABINET\n\nThe president forms a cabinet, but the military controls three of the most powerful ministries. They are the interior, defense and border security ministries.\n\nPARTIES:\n\nUNION SOLIDARITY AND DEVELOPMENT PARTY (USDP)\n\nSet up under military rule, the USDP is packed with former junta members and powerful tycoons keen on maintaining close ties with a new government that is likely to press ahead with privatization.\n\nPresident Thein Sein consolidated his position ahead of the election by removing the powerful parliamentary speaker from the party's leadership. Although not standing for election himself, Thein Sein could be re-elected if put forward as a candidate.\n\nThe USDP won more than 75 percent of all contested seats in a 2010 general election, widely condemned as rigged. In by-elections in 2012, contested by the NLD, it won one seat.\n\nNATIONAL LEAGUE FOR DEMOCRACY (NLD)\n\nMyanmar's largest opposition party won a 1990 election but the result was ignored by the military. It boycotted the 2010 vote. After Suu Kyi's release from house arrest in late 2010, it took part in by-elections in 2012, winning 43 of 44 seats contested.\n\nSuu Kyi has pledged to amend the junta-drafted constitution, accelerate reforms and forge sustainable peace with ethnic minority rebels.\n\nWhether the NLD will have enough seats to elect its candidate president is unclear.\n\nSuu Kyi is banned from becoming president by the constitution because her two children are British. She has said she will be above the president and described the constitution as \"very silly\".\n\nShe has come under fire for not including Muslims as candidates, not nurturing strong party leaders and for being vague about how the NLD would govern.\n\nETHNIC SHAN PARTIES\n\nPerhaps the most influential of various ethnic minority parties, Shan parties are pushing for amendment of the constitution and more autonomy for their state. Shan people are the second-biggest ethnic group after majority Burmans, with about 6 million people inhabiting Shan State.\n\nBoth the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy and Shan Nationalities Democratic Party stem from the same party which, like the NLD, split over whether to take part in the 2010 election.\n\nBoth are fielding candidates outside Shan State, including in constituencies in the cities of Yangon and Mandalay.\n\nARAKAN NATIONAL PARTY (ANP)\n\nTwo parties in Rakhine State merged to set up the ANP in 2014, tapping anti-Muslim sentiment after sectarian violence in 2012.\n\nThe hardline Buddhist party has campaigned to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Rohingya voters and lobbied to exclude Rohingya candidates from the election.\n\nThe party has 77 candidates, including 63 in Rakhine State, and looks likely to win all those seats, which would make it a major force in the state and one of the most powerful minority parties in the national assembly.\n\n(Compiled by the Yangon newsroom)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The party of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was on course for a landslide victory,", "title": "Myanmar's election, results and transition", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/09/Myanmars-election-results-and-transition", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/myanmar-election_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/11/09/Myanmars-election-results-and-transition", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/myanmar-election_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The party of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was on course for a landslide victory,", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Shan people are the second-biggest ethnic group after majority Burmans, with about 6 million people inhabiting Shan State.\nBoth are fielding candidates outside Shan State, including in constituencies in the cities of Yangon and Mandalay.\nRESULTSThe Union Electoral Commission (UEC) plans to announce preliminary nationwide results on Nov. 10, and final results no later than two weeks after the vote.\nThe first batch of results announced on Monday returned 12 out of 12 seats in the lower house to the NLD, all in Yangon.\nThe commission is making rolling announcements of results by constituency as they come in from around the country on Nov. 9."}
