Late Show host David Letterman released some good news regarding the Obamacare website Tuesday night, pointing to a new website, healthcare.xxx.

HEALTHCARE.XXX AD: If you are one of the millions of Americans who’s been frustrated by the malfunctioning healthcare.gov web site, try the trouble-free alternative, the healthcare.xxx, It’s your internet home for explicit adult content featuring doctors, nurses, lab technicians, phlebotomists, medical billers and more. Not affiliate with healthcare.gov. www.healthcare.xxx.gov, getting it done.

Letterman also referred to consulting company McKinsey telling the White House healthcare.gov would not be ready months before the planned rollout:

LETTERMAN: The White House went ahead. The White House wouldn’t have made this mistake but they don’t know how to open e-mail. So now the White House has hired a consulting firm to tell them, to teach them how to pay attention to consulting firms. It’s all tax dollars.
