Carlo Kemp said he’s on one of the trips of his lifetime.

The Fairview senior linebacker is in South Bend, Ind., this weekend for an official recruiting visit to fabled Notre Dame. He’ll be there to also see the Irish take on Navy.

“I can’t wait and I’m looking forward to it,” he said earlier this week, detailing how he wanted to see the stadium, campus, class rooms and, of course, Touchdown Jesus, the famous mural.

After Kemp helped the Knights win 47-46 in two overtimes against Rocky Mountain in Fort Collins in the Class 5A Front Range League on Thursday night — he also added a 3-yard touchdown run — he was joined by his mother, Jennifer and grand parents, Sam and Diana Pagano, for the trip to the Midwest. They left on Friday morning.

Earlier, Kemp took an official visit to Michigan. He will take at least two more, including to the University of Colorado.

“It has been pretty cool, both trips to Fort Collins on Thursdays, then Michigan-BYU and now Notre Dame-Navy,” Fairview coach Tom McCartney said. “Those are two awesome trips and stadiums, incredible universities for him to visit. We’re pretty excited for him.”
