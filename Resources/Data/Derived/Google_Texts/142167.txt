Months after the New Mexico Veterans Affairs Healthcare System promised changes in how it schedules veterans for medical appointments, Action 7 News is learning some are still waiting for care.

Clifford Kummerer of Rio Rancho learned he had cancer a few weeks ago.

Kummerer, a 69-year-old Vietnam veteran, wasn’t feeling well, so his primary care doctor referred him to the University of New Mexico Hospital for a special procedure.

“They stuck the camera down my throat and found pancreatic cancer,” Kummerer said.

It’s aggressive, doctors told him. Doctors determined the cancer has already spread into his liver. Documents show the hospital recommended him to see a specialist.

Clifford delivered the paperwork to his doctor at the Albuquerque VA hospital.

“They made copies of it,” Clifford said.

But days later, he still hasn't received a phone call or an appointment.

His wife Vickie said he got on the phone right away.

“That's all he did yesterday,” she said. “And the day before that. He was just calling, calling, calling.”

“Sometimes you get an answering machine,” Clifford said. “Other times, you get a long ringing where nobody answers.”

For two weeks, he said he couldn't get an appointment with an oncologist.

The experience is also troubling to other veterans. Three months ago, the New Mexico VA director said he wanted to see the problem of long wait times go away.

Action 7 News asked to talk to the VA director on camera, but instead, received a statement. It says in part, "Because oncology is so urgent, we squeeze patients in as early as their condition warrants."

Three weeks after his diagnosis, Clifford finally has an appointment. However, it’s not until July.

“The clock is ticking,” said Vickie, Kummerer's wife, sitting beside him in their Rio Rancho home.

“This is cancer," she said.

Kummerer hopes an oncologist can finally calm his fears.
