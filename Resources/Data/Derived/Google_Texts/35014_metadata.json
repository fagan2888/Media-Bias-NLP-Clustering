Other causes include elimination of parole at the federal level, limits on the use of good conduct time and other credits to shorten sentences, and more enforcement of immigration crimes.\n\nMostly because of mandatory minimum sentences, the task force notes, very few federal offenders are sentenced to alternatives to prison such as probation or treatment providers like mental health and drug courts. In fact, 90 percent of federal offenses involve incarceration time, the task force found during its year-long research project.\n\nMandatory minimum sentencing laws, most of which were enacted during the tough-on-crime period of the 1980s, require binding prison terms of a particular length and prevent judges from using their discretion to apply punishment.\n\nIn Congress, both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees have passed legislation that would reduce mandatory minimum prison sentences for certain nonviolent drug offenses and allow well-behaved inmates to earn time off their prison terms.\n\n>>>Senators Reach Long-Elusive Deal to Reduce \u2018Unjust\u2019 Prison Sentences\n\nPresident Barack Obama and conservative and liberal leaders of Congress are hoping to reach a broad criminal justice reform deal sometime this year, but the various sides are still grappling with differences in their proposals.\n\nThe task force calls on Congress to seize the momentum surrounding the issue and to implement reforms similar to what Deep South states have done over the last few years.\n\n\u201cWe must capitalize on this rare moment in time,\u201d the report reads. \u201cPolitical leaders on both sides of the aisle agree that our current correctional approach has yielded poor dividends while squandering human potential. Let us harness this momentum for change and enact wise, cost-effective reforms that promote a safer society and make our criminal justice system work better.\u201d\n\nStates such as Texas, Georgia, and South Carolina, dealing with their own overcrowded prison systems, have implemented reforms to sentencing and post-prison supervision that have helped the states reduce their inmate populations and limit re-offense rates.\n\n>>>How Overcrowding Has Forced Alabama to Confront Its Prison Problem\n\nThe federal prison system, the task force reports, operates at 20 percent above capacity, contributing to the fact that federal prison spending has grown at more than twice the rate of the rest of the Department of Justice budget and now accounts for one-quarter of the agency\u2019s total spending.\n\nHere are some reforms proposed by the task force:\n\nReserve prison beds for those convicted of the most serious crimes\n\nCriminal justice officials should promote an increase in the use of specialty courts, probation, and other alternatives to prison, especially for drug offenders. The report noted that almost 80 percent of inmates convicted of drug crimes had no prior criminal history.\n\nPromote culture of rehabilitation in prison\n\nPrison conditions should be safe and humane, with sufficient staffing and programs that are offered based on the specific needs of a prisoner.\n\nIncentivize inmates\u2019 participation in programming\n\nUse incentives like earned time off to promote participation in cognitive behavioral therapy, education, and faith-based programs. Based on inmates\u2019 performance and behavior, they should have a chance at getting their sentences reduced.\n\nAllow for successful reintegration by using evidence-based practices in post-prison supervision\n\nAgencies should share data and coordinate to help probation officers understand the likelihood that an inmate will re-offend once he leaves prison. Probation officers should tailor an inmate\u2019s treatment plan based on his level of risk, which should be based on factors such as job prospects, family support, and living circumstances. Currently, about 40 percent of those who leave federal prison are re-arrested or have their supervision revoked within three years.\n\nHold agencies accountable for results with better oversight\n\nThe task force recommends the creation of an inter-agency oversight body that would include U.S. attorneys, Bureau of Prison officials, probation officers, the Justice Department\u2019s deputy attorney general, and others. The group would meet quarterly to review the agencies\u2019 performance, and it would submit an annual report to Congress.\n\nReinvest savings from reducing the prison population into programming, supervision, and treatment\n\nCongress should make sure that probation has enough staffing to take on the increased caseload that would occur from reducing the number of inmates who are sentenced to prison.\n\n\u201cThese expenditures will be recovered in savings realized through a reduced prison population,\u201d the report says.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A task force set up by Congress says the government can save $5 billion by abandoning a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to the federal prison system.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A task force set up by Congress says the government can save $5 billion by abandoning a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to the federal prison system.", "title": "Task Force Shows How US Can Cut Prison Population by 60,000, Save $5 Billion", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ColsonPrisonReport.png", "updated_time": "2016-01-27T23:06:20+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1ZTCgtD"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "A task force set up by Congress says the government can save $5 billion by abandoning a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to the federal prison system.", "title": "Task Force Shows How US Can Cut Prison Population by 60,000, Save $5 Billion", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ColsonPrisonReport.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2016-01-27T17:33:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-27T23:06:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "criminal justice reform, Charles Colson Task Force, mandatory minimum, Justice Department, Judiciary Committee, nonviolent drug offender, Obama"}, "article_summary": "The task force mostly blames the sevenfold increase in the federal prison population (currently estimated at 196,000 inmates) on mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes.\nCurrently, about 40 percent of those who leave federal prison are re-arrested or have their supervision revoked within three years.\nIn fact, 90 percent of federal offenses involve incarceration time, the task force found during its year-long research project.\nThe task force calls on Congress to seize the momentum surrounding the issue and to implement reforms similar to what Deep South states have done over the last few years.\nMostly because of mandatory minimum sentences, the task force notes, very few federal offenders are sentenced to alternatives to prison such as probation or treatment providers like mental health and drug courts."}
