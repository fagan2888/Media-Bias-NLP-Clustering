And the first year is very important.\u201d\n\nDemocrats say the president is in charge of focusing the party\u2019s message \u2014 and that it shouldn\u2019t be something that simply says, \u201cwe\u2019re not the Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cA strong party is the key to a lasting legacy,\u201d said one senior Democratic strategist, Politico reported. \u201cWhether it\u2019s for our ideals as Democrats or it\u2019s for his personal legacy \u2014 if we lose the White House and continue to get gutted down ballot, they will repeal the ACA [Obamacare] and everything else we\u2019ve fought so hard for, and all of this will be for naught.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ms. Brazile suggested Mr. Obama needs to dig deep and prepare for a fight.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans have not retreated from the battlefield, so why should President Obama surrender? He can\u2019t give up, he can\u2019t waver,\u201d she said, Politico reported. \u201cAll of that looks to Democrats like he doesn\u2019t stand for much and it\u2019s not the truth.\u201d\n\nRep. Bill Pascrell, from New Jersey, put it this way: It looks as if the Democrats \u201chave lost our way,\u201d and the party needs to have a \u201cdeep discussion, not just a philosophical but a tangible discussion, about where we are as a party. It\u2019s kind of difficult \u2026 to do that because we have not had that kind of relationship\u201d with the White House, Politico reported.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Key Democrats frustrated by Election Day losses say President Obama better get in gear and get the party back in shape \u2014 that the base needs his leadership.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Key Democrats frustrated by Election Day losses say President Obama better get in gear and get the party back in shape \u2014 that the base needs his leadership.", "title": "Democrats turn on Obama: Get \u2018in the mix\u2019 and fix our party", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/20/democrats-turn-on-obama-get-in-the-mix-and-fix-our/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/21/7_212014_ap1105040493108201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/21/7_212014_ap1105040493108201.jpg", "description": "Key Democrats frustrated by Election Day losses say President Obama better get in gear and get the party back in shape \u2014 that the base needs his leadership.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Democrats turn on Obama: Get \u2018in the mix\u2019 and fix our part"}, "Author": "Cheryl K.
