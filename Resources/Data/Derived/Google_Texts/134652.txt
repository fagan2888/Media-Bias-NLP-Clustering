Choctaw County Sheriff Elect Scott Lolley confirms that Justin Terrell Gordon was taken into custody in Tuscaloosa at 7 p.m. Saturday.

Gordon had escaped the Choctaw County Jail earlier Saturday morning, along with two other inmates. Gordon was incarcerated for pending armed robbery charges. The other two suspects are still at large.

"Justin Gordon was arrested. The other two are still at large right now," Lolley says. "The U.S. Marshals are in custody of him, and they're going to transport him. I wouldn't really want to say where we would want to transport him to for security reasons because we still have two more people out there."
