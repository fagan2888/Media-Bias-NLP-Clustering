The Republican-dominated House of Delegates maintained its opposition to any form of Medicaid expansion, and again demanded that the issue be severed from budget negotiations. The House passed a budget bill on March 25 that contains no Medicaid expansion provisions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done what we\u2019re supposed to do, and now it\u2019s their turn,\u201d said Senate Democratic Leader Richard Saslaw, D-Fairfax County, after the politically divided Senate passed its budget (SB 5003) by a vote of 22-15.\n\nThe Senate\u2019s two-year, $99 billion spending plan includes a provision to expand health coverage to an estimated 250,000 low-income, uninsured Virginians. The state would use federal Medicaid expansion funds available under the Affordable Care Act to help eligible adults purchase private insurance.\n\nThe House rejected an identical Senate Medicaid proposal during the regular legislative session, which ended March 8. At the outset of the special session, the House Appropriations Committee killed Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s proposal to expand Medicaid eligibility under a two-year pilot project that would be paid for with federal funds.\n\nHouse Republicans have argued that the state must fully implement reforms to the existing Medicaid program before expanding the rolls to cover adults with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Del. Steve Landes, R-Augusta County, panned the Senate proposal during Tuesday\u2019s House floor session.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s flawed, it\u2019s unworkable and it does nothing to fix a system that we know needs fixing,\u201d Landes said.\n\nThe Senate budget would remove authority from a joint legislative commission that was established last year to determine whether Virginia had made the reforms necessary to expand Medicaid eligibility. Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, warned that the provision would give McAuliffe the authority to expand Medicaid without the legislature\u2019s approval.\n\nThe Senate has taken no action on the budget bill the House passed two weeks ago. House GOP leaders said precedent demands that the House bill serve as the vehicle the two chambers use to negotiate a new spending plan. The Senate\u2019s budget bill typically gets left in the House Appropriations Committee, said Del. Chris Jones, R-Suffolk, the committee\u2019s chairman.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way it is done; that\u2019s the way it will always be done,\u201d Jones said during the brief, uneventful House floor session.\n\nAsked if the Senate will act on the House budget bill, Saslaw said: \u201cWe will gladly send them their bill as soon as they send us ours back with their amendments on them.\u201d\n\nBy the time the House began its floor session Tuesday afternoon, the Senate already had left the Capitol.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very disappointed because, obviously, the intention of the Senate is just to stall,\u201d said House Speaker Bill Howell, R-Stafford County.\n\nThe Senate budget incorporates McAuliffe\u2019s proposal to increase salaries for state employees and teachers in 2015. The Senate budget would fund the state\u2019s share of a 2 percent raise for teachers, certain instructional and support positions, and state-supported local employees effective April 1, 2015. State employees and college faculty would get a 2 percent raise effective March 25, 2015. The Senate plan also would restore state funding for a program that provides insurance coverage to first responders.\n\nIn a statement issued by his office, McAuliffe said the Senate budget \u201coffers Virginia state employees a two percent raise, funds payments to families that lose a loved one in the line of duty, and includes a market-based plan to use our federal tax dollars to close the health care coverage gap.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow it is the responsibility of the House of Delegates to take this budget bill up, make their amendments and pass it so that legislators from both chambers can get to work negotiating a final product in a conference committee,\u201d McAuliffe said.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "www.roanoke.com", "description": "RICHMOND \u2014 Both houses of the General Assembly went home Tuesday passing a new state budget.", "title": "Two Virginia state budgets pass, yet lawmakers no closer to deal", "url": "http://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/two-virginia-state-budgets-pass-yet-lawmakers-no-closer-to/article_635359b8-bf7e-11e3-9cbf-001a4bcf6878.html", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/roanoke.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/ce/7ce3fa36-bf7e-11e3-856f-001a4bcf6878/5344955fcb36f.preview-500.jpg?resize=500%2C385", "height": 385}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@roanoketimes", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "RICHMOND \u2014 Both houses of the General Assembly went home Tuesday passing a new state budget.", "fb": {"app_id": 251357365028982}, "keywords": "general assembly,politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/roanoketimes"}, "news_keywords": "general assembly,politics"}, "article_summary": "RICHMOND \u2014 Both houses of the General Assembly went home Tuesday passing a new state budget.\nThe state would use federal Medicaid expansion funds available under the Affordable Care Act to help eligible adults purchase private insurance.\nThe Senate plan also would restore state funding for a program that provides insurance coverage to first responders.\nThe Senate budget incorporates McAuliffe\u2019s proposal to increase salaries for state employees and teachers in 2015.\nThe House passed a budget bill on March 25 that contains no Medicaid expansion provisions."}
