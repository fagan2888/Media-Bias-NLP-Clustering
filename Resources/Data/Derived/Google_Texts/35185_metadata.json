(Pioneer Press: John Doman)\n\n\n\nFinancial analysts sound gloomy when talking about the outlook for hospitals.\n\nMore patients are getting care elsewhere, they say, while insurance companies and the government are trying to pay less for every test, surgery or procedure provided.\n\nYet Twin Cities hospitals and the large groups that run them seemed to hold their own financially last year, as the nation\u2019s health care system prepared for sweeping changes in 2014 with the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nEight of 11 health systems based in the five-county metro area posted better operating results in 2013 than during the previous year, according to a Pioneer Press analysis.\n\nAs a group, the local hospital systems \u2014 typically including clinics and large regional anchor medical centers \u2014 posted a collective operating income of about $373 million last year, an increase of roughly 5 percent from $354 million during 2012.\n\nHospital systems included in the Pioneer Press analysis collected about $12.3 billion in revenue last year. So the profit margin worked out to about 3 cents per dollar of revenue.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good number,\u201d said Martin Arrick, an analyst with Standard & Poor\u2019s, a bond ratings agency.\n\nNoting that hospitals in the Twin Cities also had a 3 percent profit margin in 2012, Arrick commented: \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s stable is also favorable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re holding their own at a time of great change and transformation,\u201d said Lawrence Massa, chief executive of the Minnesota Hospital Association, a trade group. \u201cOur hospitals have been very steady.\u201d\n\nPENT-UP DEMAND\n\nFlat earnings might not sound very sexy. But it\u2019s better than what many hospitals across the country were seeing last year.\n\nIn April, the Moody\u2019s bond rating agency reported that operating margins and operating cash flow margins dropped in 2013 at nonprofit hospitals across the country; revenue growth continued to slow and failed to keep pace with expenses.\n\nOf the 203 organizations included in the Moody\u2019s survey, the median profit margin fell to 2.2 percent last year from 2.5 percent in 2012.\n\nIn June, Modern Healthcare magazine analyzed data from 179 health systems across the country and found the average operating margin fell from 3.6 percent in 2012 to 3.1 percent in 2013. About 61 percent of organizations in the Modern Healthcare survey saw their operating margins deteriorate during the time period.\n\n\u201cWe currently have a negative outlook on the not-for-profit health care sector,\u201d said Sarah Vennekotter, a Moody\u2019s analyst. \u201cThere are a lot of challenges that the industry is going to continue to face.\u201d\n\nIn recent weeks, some for-profit hospital companies have reported surprisingly strong 2014 financial results, which are adding a new wrinkle to the otherwise gloomy outlook, said Arrick of Standard & Poor\u2019s. The Affordable Care Act has led to an expansion of health insurance coverage \u2014 particularly through state Medicaid programs \u2014 and the result is more revenue for hospitals.\n\nBut Arrick predicted the bounce would be short-lived.\n\n\u201cThis group of people who now have insurance cards will roil the numbers for a year or two, because our sense is there\u2019s pent-up demand there for services,\u201d Arrick said. \u201cBut once that rolls through and is in the baseline, all the trends are toward less utilization.\u201d\n\nWhile financial analysts see gloom in the hospital sector, consumers looking at hospital bills keep seeing an increase in prices, said Betsy Imholz, special projects director with Consumers Union, the policy division of Consumer Reports magazine.\n\nIn some parts of the country, Imholz said, hospitals have merged with other medical centers and expanded into out-patient services in ways that have given them market power and higher payment rates.\n\n\u201cRelative to some other parts of the economy, hospitals are doing pretty well,\u201d Imholz said.\n\nDEFUSING COSTS\n\nTo evaluate the financial health of hospitals in the Twin Cities, the Pioneer Press collected audited financial statements from hospitals and hospital systems based in Anoka, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey and Washington counties. The figures don\u2019t include investment income.\n\nBy revenue, Minneapolis-based Allina Health System, operator of United Hospital in St. Paul, was the largest operator of hospitals and clinics around the five-county region last year. Allina\u2019s operating profit margin for the year was about 4 percent, but things took a turn for the worse during the first quarter of 2014. In May, Allina officials said they were looking to cut $100 million in operating costs after the health system barely broke even for the three-month period ended March 31.\n\nThere have been few details on how the cuts will be made, but officials say large layoffs aren\u2019t in the works.\n\nThese are challenging times for health care systems, said David Kanihan, an Allina spokesman. Patient volumes are shrinking at a time when hospitals must make investments to participate in new \u201caccountable care organizations,\u201d or ACOs.\n\nThese contract arrangements try to contain costs by setting a budget for health care providers as they serve a specified group of patients. If actual care costs exceed the budget, hospitals and doctors lose money. If costs are less than the budgeted amount, the health care providers can share in the savings.\n\nHospitals need good \u2014 and costly \u2014 information systems to enter into these arrangements. Plus, the contracts provide clear incentives to contain costs.\n\nAllina and other health systems are involved in ACO-style contracts with government insurance programs and/or commercial health plans.\n\n\u201cHospitals in this market are not bucking the trend,\u201d Kanihan said in a prepared response to questions.\n\nOTHER RESULTS\n\nThe Minneapolis-based Fairview system, operator of the University of Minnesota Medical Center, posted a slightly higher profit figure than Allina, with operating income of $134 million on just under $3.4 billion in revenue.\n\nThe operating profit was better than in 2012 and represented a significant improvement over 2011. At that time, Fairview earnings were hurt by one-time charges as the health system was implementing a new electronic health record system and opening a replacement children\u2019s hospital.\n\n\u201cThe 2013 performance was much improved over the past few years,\u201d said Rulon Stacey, Fairview\u2019s chief executive officer, in an interview. \u201cIt has rebounded from a point where it was unsustainably low.\u201d\n\nIncome was up last year at Children\u2019s Hospitals & Clinics of Minnesota, which has hospitals in Minneapolis and St. Paul, as well as at Gillette Children\u2019s Specialty Healthcare, which is based in St. Paul. The local results fit with a broader trend in which children\u2019s hospitals across the country out-perform medical centers for adults, said Alec Mahmood, chief financial officer at Children\u2019s.\n\nThe financial picture got a little gloomier last year at Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, which posted a $28 million operating loss. That was worse than in 2012, when HCMC had a loss of nearly $9.3 million.\n\nOperating margins have suffered because the hospital is making strategic long-term investments, said Thomas Hayes, an HCMC spokesman. The hospital has expanded its network of primary care clinics, opening locations over the past five years in Brooklyn Park, St. Anthony Village and Golden Valley.\n\n\u201cHCMC initiated action plans to improve revenues/decrease expenses by 5 percent in 2013 and another 5 percent in 2014,\u201d Hayes said in a prepared response to questions. \u201cWe are currently operating at break-even through the first half of 2014.\u201d\n\nLakeview Health in Stillwater posted a $1.8 million loss on operations last year due in part to extra expense with its electronic health record, said Dave Dziuk, the chief financial officer at Bloomington-based HealthPartners, which owns the hospital and a related network of clinics. Lakeview also has hired new physicians and opened a new clinic in Mahtomedi.\n\n\u201cIt takes a while for patient volume to ramp up with the hiring of new physicians and opening of the new clinic,\u201d Dziuk wrote in an email.\n\nIn terms of revenue, Northfield Hospital was the smallest health system in the Pioneer Press analysis, but also posted one of the highest profit margins last year at about 5 percent. The income is helping the hospital build reserves and make investments, including $2 million for an improved MRI magnet.\n\n\u201cAlthough our bond rating has gone up recently, I believe the rating agencies look at this sector as volatile,\u201d said CEO Steve Underdahl in a statement. \u201cMy sense is that bond rating organizations look at all of the variables and unknowns associated with health care reform, new care delivery models and new customer expectations, and find the future of our industry difficult to predict.\u201d\n\nUNKNOWNS PERSIST\n\nAs in other states, Minnesota has seen a decline in its uninsured rate this year. But it\u2019s possible the change will have less impact on hospital finances here than elsewhere, said Massa of the Minnesota Hospital Association, because the state already had one of the nation\u2019s lowest uninsured rates.\n\nThe low uninsured rate over the years is one reason why hospitals here traditionally have been relatively strong financially, said Vennekotter, the analyst with Moody\u2019s. Another factor, she said, is that Minnesota hospitals were early to the trend of creating multi-hospital networks that include clinics, so that care can be better coordinated for efficiency.\n\nFinally, Minnesota hospitals benefit from a relatively strong local economy, Vennekotter said, including a low unemployment rate.\n\nBut in general, the gloom persists.\n\n\u201cReimbursement will continue to be tight,\u201d Vennekotter said. \u201cYou have the trend of declining employer-sponsored health insurance plans, plus higher deductibles and co-pays, which means higher bad debt for hospitals and lower profitability.\u201d\n\nChristopher Snowbeck can be reached at 651-228-5479.
