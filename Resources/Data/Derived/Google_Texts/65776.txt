The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration will audit 31 hospitals to determine whether their contracts with Medicaid managed-care plans comply with state law, according to a list released Wednesday by Gov. Rick Scott's office.

AHCA Secretary Liz Dudek on July 17 sent a letter that requested hospitals and insurers certify that they did not exceed a limit on Medicaid payment rates. That limit is 120 percent of a Medicaid fee schedule.

The hospitals that will be audited did not respond to the request or did not meet an Aug. 1 deadline. The hospitals are scattered throughout the state.

Most Medicaid beneficiaries are required to enroll in managed-care plans, as lawmakers and Scott have sought to better control the costs of the program.

But in the July 17 letter, Dudek wrote that the agency has "grave concerns that hospital contractual arrangements may have ballooned to unreasonable proportions and higher than what is allowed by state law."

According to the Governor’s Office, the following hospitals will be audited by the Office of Medicaid Program Integrity for either not responding to the request, indicated by an asterisk, or for failing to provide information by the deadline:
