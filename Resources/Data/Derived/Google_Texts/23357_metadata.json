He played at Georgia Tech, where coach Paul Johnson\u2019s offense was a flex-bone running attack.\n\nThomas played early in his NFL career with Tim Tebow as his quarterback.\n\nAnd despite seven consecutive, 100-yard receiving games earlier this season, Thomas was pushed aside by the Broncos\u2019 newfound focus on building a running game.\n\nFor three consecutive games Thomas went without a 100-yard receiving game. Last week, he made only two catches for 11 yards.\n\nHe snapped his production slump Sunday with six catches for 123 yards in a 22-10 victory against San Diego.\n\n\u201cIt feels great,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know I had what I had until I got in the locker room. It\u2019s a long season, guys beat up. It was a nice win.\u201d\n\nThomas was among those feeling the pain of victory. He received treatment after the game and dressed slowly, as if putting on his shirt took every sore muscle in his body.\n\nHe might have had an even bigger game against the Chargers but the Broncos modified their game plan in light of Manning\u2019s illness. Did Thomas think throughout the week he was going to be featured?\n\nPHOTOS: Denver Broncos vs. San Diego Chargers, Dec. 14, 2014\n\n\u201cI feel like that every week,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cBut they got it to me early, trying to get me started early.\u201d\n\nThomas caught a crossing route then ran for 36 yards in the first quarter to set up a field goal. He beat Chargers\u2019 star cornerback Brandon Flowers for a 29-yard reception down the right sideline to set up another field goal in the second quarter. In the third, Thomas worked with Manning to beat Flowers on a back-shoulder play down the right side that resulted in a 28-yard touchdown.\n\nIt was the Broncos\u2019 only touchdown and it gave them a 16-3 lead.\n\n\u201cPeyton\u2019s been doing that for a long time,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe kept going to the sideline and saying they\u2019re playing high on the fade, give me a chance to back-shoulder. He did and it worked. It was a touchdown we needed at the time because it felt like they were getting momentum.\u201d\n\nBRONCOS MAILBAG: Pose a question for Mike Klis\n\nThomas is putting the finishing catches on a remarkable three-year run. He had 94 catches for 1,434 yards and 10 touchdowns in 2012.\n\nLast season he made 92 catches for 1,430 yards and 14 touchdowns.\n\nWith two games remaining, he has a career-best 96 receptions for 1,389 yards and 11 touchdowns. His eight, 100-yard games ties the team record set by Rod Smith in the 2000 season.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Demaryius Thomas snaps production slump with 123-yard outing", "title": "Demaryius Thomas snaps production slump with 123-yard outing", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/14/demaryius-thomas-snaps-production-slump-with-123-yard-outing/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141214__demaryius-klisp1.jpg", "height": 447}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141214__demaryius-klisp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-14T20:34:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T06:45:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "PHOTOS: Denver Broncos vs. San Diego Chargers, Dec. 14, 2014\u201cI feel like that every week,\u201d Thomas said.\nFor three consecutive games Thomas went without a 100-yard receiving game.\nAnd despite seven consecutive, 100-yard receiving games earlier this season, Thomas was pushed aside by the Broncos\u2019 newfound focus on building a running game.\nHe snapped his production slump Sunday with six catches for 123 yards in a 22-10 victory against San Diego.\nSAN DIEGO \u2014 There were big plans to get Demaryius Thomas going Sunday."}
