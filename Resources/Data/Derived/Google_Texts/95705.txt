by Gene Beley, Delta CorrespondentCLARKSBURGSeptember 21, 2014 9:00pmHow many calls to the government does it take to get something done about one abandoned boat?

Anna Swenson knows. She kept count. This is her story.

Boat owners who think they can dump a boat in the California Delta had better not leave it in the Clarksburg area. There is a tenacious woman there, Anna Swenson, who will call every government agency in the state, if necessary, to get rid of the boat and hopefully have them penalize the boat owner for leaving it there.

Mrs. Swenson pointed out the problem to members of North Delta Community Area Residents for Environmental Stability of Clarksburg, better known by its acronym, North Delta CARES, at their weekly Thursday night meeting, which usually takes on bigger issues like the governors twin tunnels that have threatened the quaint, charming river town on the Sacramento River.

But recently she wanted to vent her spleen about having to call 25 government agencies about one houseboat that its owner had dumped on the Sacramento River in the Clarksburg area.

She said the houseboat used to park along the levees. One day it was just kind of brought up on the levee and it sat there for months and months, she began telling the audience. I have called every agency that has anything to do with the Delta. The only person who ever responded was Raymond Costantino from the Delta Protection Commission. He said if there is an abandoned vessel in the Delta, whatever county is responsible has to publish a notice to the owner, unless the owner is standing there. Then they can seize the boat and take it away. And the counties do not want to publish an advertisement for just one boat owner. They want an accumulation of boats before they can publish a $15 advertisement in the local newspaper.

The frustrated Mrs. Swenson warned that if there is a high-water event in the Delta or if the boat just breaks up, that ship will become dislodged and will hit something on our Delta  someones property, dock, or bridge. All things in the Delta float south.

If Californias counties cannot afford a newspaper legal ad, then area residents might want to pry the pennies out of their piggy banks.

We could pass the hat and raise $15, said a smiling Barbara Daly, a Clarksburg resident and librarian.

The powers that be are not taking the safety of our property and the Delta seriously, continued Mrs. Swenson. Bob Kirtlan, a Clarksburg property owner, said the houseboat owner had already had three run-ins with Sacramento County and then made a mistake of parking on my property. I told him he had two days to remove it. Then he went across the river and now its Mark Scribners problem.

Mark Pruner, an attorney and founder of North Delta CARES, said he has learned through Erik Vink at the Delta Protection Commission that they can get help through the state Department of Parks and Recreation, since the Recreational Boaters of California are now rolled into that department. They have some say about abandoned vessels and removing them.

Mr. Kirtlan warned that there are marine laws to follow. If the vessel is in distress, hes allowed to stay there, said Mr. Kirtlan.

But it shouldnt take 25 calls, which is what I did, ranging from the Coast Guard to counties to county supervisors. We shouldnt have to do that. These agencies should be able to say, Oh, for an abandoned vessel, call this person, instead of Let me get back to you.

She said the Coast Guard only empties any fuel out of the vessel, or toxic substances, which they did, she reported.

It is a very mysterious, non-transparent process in this Delta, Mrs. Swenson concluded. My belief is there are too many cooks in the kitchen.

Whos got a match? yelled 92 year-old Pete Hunn, a Clarksburg farmer.

Well figure it out, Mrs. Swenson told Mr. Hunn. We want to go through the bureaucratic process. Were gluttons for punishment.
