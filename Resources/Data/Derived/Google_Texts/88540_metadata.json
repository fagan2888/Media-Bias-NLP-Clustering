The adversarial relationship between the mayor and the New Orleans police union could play a large part.\n\nEric Hessler, an attorney for the Police Association of New Orleans, which represents 500 NOPD officers, compares it to the relationship between New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and the New York City Police Department.\n\n\u201cFor the Sugar Bowl, civilian groups had to put up signs warning tourists to walk in groups,\u201d Hessler said. \u201cThe signs said \u2018We love our NOPD, but we just don\u2019t have enough of them.\u2019 There are dozens of these signs in the French Quarter.\u201d\n\nEven though the economy is still bad and people are out of work, Hessler said only 55 people applied to fill 150 empty police positions in 2014. About 120 officers left the NOPD at the same time, he added.\n\nPotential recruits are either migrating to other cities or taking jobs as Louisiana state troopers.\n\nIn addition to calling upon those troopers to fix things, Hessler said Landrieu has invested $2.5 million so unarmed civilians may patrol the French Quarter.\n\n\u201cIt certainly was not a wise expenditure of money,\u201d Hessler said. \u201cWhat is an unarmed security patrol going to do to stem violent crime? Nothing.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Louisiana Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal said the governor hasn\u2019t decided whether to abide by Landrieu\u2019s request.\n\n\u201cWe will make a determination for supplemental support based on the recommendations of the Colonel of the Louisiana State Police and if he decides it is necessary, sustainable to the department, and does not detract from the important work LSP does in other parts of the state,\u201d said Mike Reed.\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"description": "Only 55 people applied to fill 150 empty police positions in 2014 in New Orleans.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Only 55 people applied to fill 150 empty police positions in 2014 in New Orleans.", "title": "New Orleans Mayor Calls on State Taxpayers to Fix City\u2019s Violent Crime", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/krtphotoslive130684.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-09T16:18:03+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/143anJa"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Only 55 people applied to fill 150 empty police positions in 2014 in New Orleans.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/krtphotoslive130684.jpg"}, "title": "New Orleans Mayor Calls on State Taxpayers to Fix City\u2019s Violent Crime", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "crime", "published_time": "2015-01-10T03:01:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-09T16:18:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Mitch Landrieu, Louisiana legislature, state troopers"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde1b2\"", "article_summary": "Potential recruits are either migrating to other cities or taking jobs as Louisiana state troopers.\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 Violent crime is up 24 percent in New Orleans, and now Mayor Mitch Landrieu is calling on Louisiana taxpayers to send in more state troopers to patrol his city, essentially diverting important resources from other areas of the state.\nThe adversarial relationship between the mayor and the New Orleans police union could play a large part.\nIn addition to calling upon those troopers to fix things, Hessler said Landrieu has invested $2.5 million so unarmed civilians may patrol the French Quarter.\n\u201cFor the Sugar Bowl, civilian groups had to put up signs warning tourists to walk in groups,\u201d Hessler said."}
