Wedding bells are in the air for the Palin family as Sarah Palin’s daughter is set to marry a Medal of Honor recipient.

Former Marine Sgt. Dakota Meyer, 26, announced his engagement on Saturday to Bristol Palin, 24, the daughter of former VP candidate Sarah Palin.

He posted a photo of the two together on social media site Instagram, adding that he was the “luckiest guy ever.”

Mr. Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2011 for his actions in Afghanistan. During a pre-dawn patrol, two Marine platoons were ambushed by extremists. Military records show that Mr. Meyer made five trips into the heaviest fighting areas to rescue wounded Afghan soldiers and recover the bodies of fallen Marines.

Ms. Palin is a reality TV star who appeared on ABC’s popular Dancing with the Stars. She is also an advocate of preventing teen pregnancy, having gotten pregnant herself and becoming a target of criticism during her mother’s failed vice presidential campaign.
