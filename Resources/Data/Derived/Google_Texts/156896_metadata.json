They were wearing graduation caps and gowns, but most had not personally met their professors or fellow students prior to Saturday.\n\nShirley Davenport, 56, one of the commencement speakers, flew to Denver from her home state of Hawaii.\n\n\u201cThere was never a doubt that I was going to walk,\u201d said Davenport, who received a doctorate degree in psychology. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve earned it.\u201d\n\nDavenport, like most Rockies graduates, earned her degree through online courses and studies.\n\nDavenport, who holds undergraduate degrees from the University of Hawaii, lost her job in April 2010.\n\nLeft stunned, \u201cfeeling inadequate\u201d and \u201cin a fog,\u201d Davenport found the online university.\n\nAt the time she was laid off, Davenport had already made arrangements to go on a mission trip to Africa. Online studies through the university allowed her to keep that commitment, return home and resume her education without missing a beat, she said.\n\nUtah resident Jessica Aguilar, a mother of three, received a master\u2019s degree of arts in human services with specialization in mental health administration.\n\nAguilar\u2019s undergraduate degree, from Ashford University, was also earned online. The online degrees allowed her to juggle work, family and school.\n\nWhile studying at Rockies, Aguilar\u2019s son Lucas, now 5, was diagnosed with leukemia.\n\nAguilar and her husband, Moroni, founded the Lucas Leukemia Foundation, which supports children with leukemia, as well as their parents. While battling the disease, the Aguilars discovered that the stress of the illness sometimes causes families to splinter.\n\nTheir foundation offers services and programs along the Wasatch Range that are designed \u201cto keep families together,\u201d she said.\n\nLucas and his two younger siblings, along with their dad, were on hand Saturday to cheer Aguilar as she accepted her diploma.\n\n\u201cNever give up,\u201d Aguilar said. \u201cYou really need to put your best foot forward and keep moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nKieran Nicholson: 303-954-1822, knicholson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kierannicholson", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Non-traditional students celebrate traditional graduation in Denver", "title": "Non-traditional students celebrate traditional graduation in Denver", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/18/non-traditional-students-celebrate-traditional-graduation-in-denver/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141018__20141019_B3_CD19GRADUATESp1.jpg", "height": 492}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141018__20141019_B3_CD19GRADUATESp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-18T16:14:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:04:37+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde869\"", "article_summary": "About 200 nontraditional students, most from around the country, gathered in Denver on Saturday to partake in a traditional graduation ceremony: the University of the Rockies commencement.\nThey were wearing graduation caps and gowns, but most had not personally met their professors or fellow students prior to Saturday.\nAguilar\u2019s undergraduate degree, from Ashford University, was also earned online.\nLeft stunned, \u201cfeeling inadequate\u201d and \u201cin a fog,\u201d Davenport found the online university.\n\u201cBecause I\u2019ve earned it.\u201dDavenport, like most Rockies graduates, earned her degree through online courses and studies."}
