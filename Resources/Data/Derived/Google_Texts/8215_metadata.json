Just take our short quiz and GOP-Harmony will match you up with a candidate that is as out of touch with reality as you are \u2014 or more,\" Dr. Love, GOP-Harmony\u2019s founder, tells the audience.\n\nCaricatures of conservatives soon appear, each more outrageous than the next. \"I also don\u2019t want to let Mexicans and Muslims in the country,\" one says.\n\n\"I have no idea how the economy works, and that\u2019s OK because neither does anyone on GOP-Harmony,\" insists another. The DNC must have forgotten that a committed socialist campaigning on roughly $20 trillion in tax increases is a serious challenger for the Democratic nomination.\n\nThe fake commercial touts a list of \"over a dozen metrics to determine which GOP candidate matches with your views.\" Included on this list are the words and phrases \"misogyny,\" \"fear,\" \"climate denial,\" xenophobia, \"allergic to facts.\"\n\n\"If you\u2019re the kind of person who other people don\u2019t like being around, then GOP-Harmony is perfect. You will find a slew of candidates exactly like you,\" Dr. Love\u2019s pitch finishes.\n\nClearly, the DNC sees little point in holding a civil conversation or reasoned debate. After all, why bother having an argument one could risk losing? It\u2019s far easier to just launch insults at one\u2019s opponents.\n\nBut the DNC is insulting half the country, and casting millions of good, honest people as effectively evil. In a Gallup Poll released in May 2015, 31 percent of Americans identified as very conservative or conservative on social issues, 33 percent identified as moderate, and another 31 percent identified as very liberal or liberal.\n\nOn economic issues, the same survey found that 39 percent of Americans identified as very conservative or conservative, and 37 percent identified as moderate; only 19 percent identified as liberal or very liberal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not one week since President Obama called on the nation to \"build a better politics,\" chastising politicians of all stripes for contributing to a polarized", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "LifeZette", "description": "Not one week since President Obama called on the nation to \u201cbuild a better politics,\u201d chastising politicians of all stripes for contributing to a polarized political environment in which we \u201ccall each other idiots and fascists,\u201d the Democratic National Committee has released a video casting GOP voters as unintelligent bigots.
