The state's Medicaid program is limiting the distribution of a new medication to treat hepatitis C.

AHCCCS, or the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, has said it costs taxpayers between $80,000 and $150,000 per patient to provide Sovaldi to people enrolled in the program

AHCCCS has thousands of patients diagnosed with hepatitis C. But so far, the program is providing coverage for 180 people under a strict screening process, The Arizona Capitol Times reported.

Under the screening process' criteria, people provided coverage for the drug must be in late stages of liver scarring from hepatitis and be drug free.

Other states limiting coverage for Sovaldi include Oregon and Illinois.
