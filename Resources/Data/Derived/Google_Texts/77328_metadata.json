That\u2019s more than one for every adult in the country,\u201d Burwell told the House Ways and Means Committee during a hearing about her department\u2019s fiscal year 2016 budget request.\n\nBurwell was responding to Rep. Richard Neal\u2019s (D-Mass.) question regarding opioid addiction.\n\n\u201cThe opioid addiction issue is pronounced now across my congressional district, and there are all sorts of stories now that indicate a nationwide trend, and curious about the response of your department, the agencies that you oversee and also to ask specifically about prescription drug misuse, the evidence that you\u2019re coming across on that basis,\u201d Neal said.\n\n\n\n\u201cOver 250 million prescriptions in 2012 for opioids,\u201d said Burwell. \u201cSo that\u2019s how many prescriptions there were, so that\u2019s more than the number of adults in our country. So that was one prescription for every adult in the country in terms of where we are and the magnitude of the problem.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn fact, she said, \u201cOpioid and overdose deaths have exceeded the number of deaths from car accidents or any other accidental death,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \u201cDrug overdose was the leading cause of injury death in 2013. Among people 25 to 64 years old, drug overdose caused more deaths than motor vehicle traffic crashes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere were 43,982 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2013. Of these, 22,767 (51.8%) were related to prescription drugs. Of the 22,767 deaths relating to prescription drug overdose in 2013, 16,235 (71.3%) involved opioid painkillers,\u201d the CDC said on its website.\n\n\n\n\n\nBurwell offered three solutions to the problem of opioid overdose. The first solution, she said, is prescribing. Burwell proposed providing new prescribing guidelines for pain and pain medication and the use of \u201cprescription drug monitoring plans,\u201d which exist in almost all 50 states.Prescription drug monitoring plans \u201care the means by which a physician has the opportunity to look up and see that a controlled substance was already given to you and control it that way - same thing with pharmacists,\u201d said Burwell.\u201cNumber two is the use of naloxone, which is a very important drug that actually stops death when there is overdose and making sure that first responders have access. That is a very important part of that picture,\u201d she said.\u201cNumber three is the issue of Medicaid-assisted treatment combined with behavior issues and making sure that we do treatment for those who are addicted,\u201d Burwell concluded.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell (AP Photo)(CNSNews.com) \u2013 Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell told Congress Wednesday that there were more than 250 million prescriptions for opioid drugs in 2012 \u2013 more than the number of adults in the U.S.", "title": "HHS Secretary: 259 Million Opioid Prescriptions in U.S. in 2012 Outnumbered American Adults", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/melanie-hunter/hhs-secretary-259-million-opioid-prescriptions-us-2012-outnumbered", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/burwell.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-11T16:36:26-04:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-11T13:18:59-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-11T16:36:26-04:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell (AP Photo)(CNSNews.com) \u2013 Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell told Congress Wednesday that there were more than 250 million prescriptions for opioid drugs in 2012 \u2013 more than the number of adults in the U.S.", "title": "HHS Secretary: 259 Million Opioid Prescriptions in U.S. in 2012 Outnumbered American Adults", "url": "http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/melanie-hunter/hhs-secretary-259-million-opioid-prescriptions-us-2012-outnumbered", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/burwell.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell (AP Photo)(CNSNews.com) \u2013 Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell told Congress Wednesday that there were more than 250 million prescriptions for opioid drugs in 2012 \u2013 more than the number of adults in the U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Among people 25 to 64 years old, drug overdose caused more deaths than motor vehicle traffic crashes.\u201d\u201cThere were 43,982 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2013.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \u201cDrug overdose was the leading cause of injury death in 2013.\nOf the 22,767 deaths relating to prescription drug overdose in 2013, 16,235 (71.3%) involved opioid painkillers,\u201d the CDC said on its website.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell (AP Photo)(CNSNews.com) \u2013 Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell told Congress Wednesday that there were more than 250 million prescriptions for opioid drugs in 2012 \u2013 more than the number of adults in the U.S.\u201cIn the year 2012, there were 259 million prescriptions for opioids.\n\u201cOver 250 million prescriptions in 2012 for opioids,\u201d said Burwell."}
