(Skyline Chili/Twitter)\n\nMark Keilholz starts the signature dish with a steaming heap of spaghetti. He soaks it in chili. Tops it with shredded cheddar cheese.\n\n\u201cMost of my customers never look at a menu,\u201d says Keilholz, 65, owner of a Skyline Chili franchise in Dayton, Ohio. \u201cThey\u2019ve been coming in for years. They know exactly what they want.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why no menu board hangs in his suburban store, which has served chili bowls and coney dogs for three decades. New customers, which are a rarity, can reference pamphlets.\n\nThose pamphlets \u2014 and Skyline Chili\u2019s protocol \u2014 will soon get a major edit. The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved new rules that will mandate calorie counts and force American diners to acknowledge the zipper-straining reality of, say, the Cheesecake Factory\u2019s Brul\u00e9d French Toast (2,780 calories). Or a large popcorn at an AMC movie theater (1,030 calories, without butter). Or a large 3-way at Skyline, which Keilholz calls a cult classic in the Midwest (1,100 calories).\n\nFour-digit calorie counts won\u2019t deter his customers, he said. Little can: \u201cNeither Rain nor sleet nor 40 MPH winds will keep Skyline customers from getting Cheese Coneys,\u201d the store\u2019s Facebook page proclaimed Monday.\n\n\u201cThey come for the atmosphere,\u201d Keilholz said. \u201cThey come because when you grow up around here, sooner or later your parents will drag you to Skyline and you learn at a young age to just love it.\u201d\n\nThe new FDA rules will cost the company time and resources, he said. And for what? Health-conscious customers can find Skyline\u2019s calorie counts online. \u201cWe\u2019re known for our chili \u2014 not for our salads. We\u2019re successful in the niche that we fill. If you try to be everything to everybody, you sacrifice your product. Your quality.\u201d\n\nDiners ripped from ignorant bliss can thank Obamacare. The rules are part of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s push to curb obesity in America, where a third of calories are devoured outside the home. This country of brunchers and craft beer chuggers and orderers of Taco Bell\u2019s Fourth Meal has one of the highest obesity rates in the world, according to the OECD.\n\nLabeled menus will help consumers make more informed food decisions, FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg told reporters this week \u2014 and by extension boost public health. Obesity increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, stroke and heart attacks, the CDC warns.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s idea: Knowledge is health power. A survey published in the American Journal of Public Health showed Americans underestimate the caloric content of restaurant foods by an average of 600 calories, Wonkblog\u2019s Jason Millman noted. That\u2019s a meal\u2019s worth of misjudgment.\n\nStarting next year, detailed nutritional information will appear at coffee shops, pizza joints, movies theaters \u2014 any food-seller with more than 20 locations. Skyline has more than 130 stores.\n\nThe FDA first issued the proposals in 2011. Debate about what food should be subject to the rules \u2014 and backlash from pizza places, theater chains and consumer advocates \u2014 stalled progress. Some business owners worried labeling menus would be a time-consuming process that could ultimately drive up costs for customers.\n\n\u201cIt was much more complicated than we originally thought it would be,\u201d Hamburg told the Post.\n\nFour years ago, as the FDA polished its sweeping requirements, Stanford researchers studied the impact of mandatory calorie posting on purchase decisions at Starbucks stores across New York City. Food purchases slightly dipped, they found, but business overall didn\u2019t suffer.\n\nDrink orders remained consistent. The staple lattes still reigned. The mocha sauce kept flowing.\n\nNothing substantial will change at Skyline, Keilholz predicts. He watched it grow from one Cincinnati store to dozens across the Midwest and Florida. The same formula has worked, he said, since 1945.\n\nHis first job in high school was serving chili at the original store, where Keilholz met his future wife, Cynthia, the granddaughter of Skyline\u2019s founder. Their grown son Chris will eventually take over the Dayton franchise.\n\nKeilholz sees no need for calorie labels. He knows exactly what goes into each greasy, cheesy dish.\u201cI still eat the chili every day,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m hanging in there. The doctor says I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\nCalories, he suspects, will be the least-read items on the little-read menus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The owner of a Skyline Chili franchise says new FDA rules won't sway customers, but will cost money.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/danielle.paquette.58", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The owner of a Skyline Chili franchise says new FDA rules won't sway customers, but will cost money.", "title": "Calorie counts won\u2019t fight obesity, Skyline chili boss says.
