But for years, the New York-area psychologist counseled long-term unemployed people on how to deal with their depression while they struggled to land another job.\n\nWhile many of her clients proved resilient in bouncing back and \u201creinventing\u201d themselves, others had a far more difficult time and tended to become panicky, \u201cvery depressed\u201d and \u201cangry victims.\u201d For those who suffered the double trauma of losing their jobs and then no longer being able to support themselves and their families, \u201cThat really slams your self-esteem,\u201d she said in an interview on Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to lose a job, but it\u2019s another not to be able to manage,\u201d she said.\n\nRelated: The Recession\u2019s \u2018Silent Mental Health Epidemic\u2019\n\nPuder-York, an executive coach and author, had a front-row seat observing the mental anguish of people who were unemployed for months if not years. Today, the estimated 3.6 million long-term unemployed account for 2.3 percent of the nation\u2019s workforce, which is still a historically high level more than five years after the start of the economic recovery.\n\nUnemployed workers are twice as likely as their employed counterparts to experience psychological problems such as depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, low subjective well-being and poor self-esteem, according to the American Psychological Association.\n\nA comprehensive study of long-term unemployed published by Rutgers University\u2019s John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development in 2011 found that the vast majority of unemployed workers experienced stress in their relationships with family and friends and that at least 11 percent reported seeking professional help for their depression within the previous 12 months.\n\nOne in two of the respondents in the two-year national study said they began avoiding friends and associates out of a sense of shame and embarrassment \u2013 a self-imposed isolation that hurt their ability to network to find work.\n\n\u201cBecause of the persistence of high levels of long term unemployment there are millions of people who are suffering from mental health problems and many of them are going untreated by professionals,\u201d Carl Van Horn, a professor of public policy and economics at Rutgers and head of the Heldrich Center, said this week.\n\n\u201cLosing a job is more than just a financial crisis for people,\u201d Van Horn says. \u201cIt creates numerous other damage: stress, anxiety, substance abuse, fights and conflicts in the family and feelings of embarrassment and depression.\u201d\n\nRelated: Unemployed and Hoping for Help from Congress\n\nThe plight of many of the long-term unemployed became even direr in late December after Congress allowed jobless benefits to expire for more than 1.6 million Americans. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) vowed that renewing an extension of federal unemployment insurance benefits would be the first order of business when the Senate returned in January, but Republicans have blocked Democratic efforts to extend the program for those who exhausted their 26 weeks of state benefits.\n\n\u201cThere are now 1.6 million unemployed Americans cut off and 2.3 million children affected,\u201d said Sarah Ayres, a policy analyst with the liberal Center for American Progress. \u201cThis money is going to people who are going to spend it \u2013 they\u2019re putting it right back into the economy. This is really a self-inflicted economic wound.\u201d\n\nRelated: Weak Jobs Report Produces More Questions Than Answers\n\nThe number of individual recipients whose benefits expire runs to about 70,000 a week.\n\nThe mental health crisis among the long term unemployed rarely gets much attention, although Van Horn has described the combination of long-term unemployment and diminished government support as \u201ca silent mental health epidemic.\u201d\n\nLong-term unemployment frequently causes depression, drug and alcohol abuses, spousal abuse, divorce and even suicide. Many of these unemployed Americans couldn\u2019t afford to seek professional help because they lost their employer-provided health care insurance when they were laid off. At the same time, federal, state and local governments cut back on spending for mental health clinics and outreach in response to budget crises spawned by the bad economy.\n\nA 2013 Urban Institute study on the consequences of long-term unemployment found, \u201cThe long-term unemployed also tend to earn less once they find new jobs. They tend to be in poorer health and have children with worse academic performance than similar workers who avoided unemployment.\u201d\n\nSome of that problem is beginning to abate, as the economy gradually improves and many unemployed people now qualify for Medicaid or heavily subsidized health insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRelated: The Mobility Myth and Other Income Inequality Surprises\n\nLast November, the Department of Health and Human Services unveiled long-awaited final rules on parity in benefits and treatment to require private insurers to cover care for mental health and addiction in the same way they handled physical illness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a trend moving in the right direction,\u201d Van Horn said. \u201cFolks who need professional help will have the access over the next few months or years.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The slow economic recovery has done little to mitigate the plight of long-term unemployed Americans, who are twice as likely as their employed counterparts to experience psychological problems such as depression, anxiety and poor self-esteem.
