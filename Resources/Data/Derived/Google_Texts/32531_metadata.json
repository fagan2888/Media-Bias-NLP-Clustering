Once word gets around, community members pull together to organize a fund\u00adraiser, but it\u2019s no small feat and it may not even bring in enough cash.\n\nNow that the Affordable Care Act (the so-called Obamacare) is in full swing, and more people are signing up for Minnesota\u2019s version of the program, known as MNsure, will artists finally catch a break?\n\nAs the March 31 deadline to enroll looms, uninsured people are weighing the pros and cons of a program that\u2019s been embroiled in controversy from the start. MNsure is starting to overcome some of its tech wrinkles, and more than 104,000 people have enrolled in it so far. Many are artists and others working in creative fields who have historically had limited options for coverage, said Nikki Hunt, health care program director at St. Paul-based Springboard for the Arts.\n\nSpringboard is helping artists navigate the system, thanks to a $50,000 federal outreach grant. Artists often lack coverage because they work independently or on temporary contracts, forcing them to shoulder the burden themselves, Hunt said.\n\nA 2008 report from Minnesota Citizens for the Arts spells it out: Artists are more than two times likelier to not have health insurance as are other Minnesotans. Fifteen percent of full-time artists had no insurance. Another report, from LINCnet, shows that artists are more likely to have catastrophic health insurance (a plan with a very high deductible, which is only useful if something horrible happens) than non-artists. When it comes to regular checkups or everyday health care issues, artists\u2019 needs aren\u2019t being met, Hunt said.\n\nPeople can sign up by March 31 to avoid paying the penalty, but MNsure recommends enrolling by March 15 to get coverage for April. Vita.mn talked to a handful of local artists about what the new law means to them. Check out their stories and decide for yourself whether to join the great Obama\u00adcare experiment.\n\nJeremy Messersmith: The artist entrepreneur\n\nSinger/songwriter Jeremy Messersmith can testify to the challenges of navigating health care as an artist. Several years ago, he quit his full-time job as an instructor at McNally Smith College of Music because he found that being tied to a regular job limited his creative options.\n\n\u201cI would have loved to have toured a lot more around my first couple records,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the most I could do was two to three weeks of touring a year around the U.S., because that was all I could fit into working a full-time job.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, after he left his job and the benefits that came with it, medical expenses skyrocketed for Messersmith and his wife, Vanessa.\n\nAbout a year ago, Messersmith had surgery at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cIt was just a huge financial hit,\u201d he said. \u201cAt one point, just to make sure I was covered, I had to pay for two plans. I was coming off another plan for a couple of months because I didn\u2019t want to have a gap in coverage, but it would be a while before the benefits kicked in. So for a long while we were paying about double our mortgage in just health insurance.\u201d\n\nSo Messersmith was thrilled about MNsure, and the prospect of saving thousands a year on a higher-quality insurance plan, when he signed up in late 2013. Like many others, he ran into technical snafus. Eventually, he spoke with a representative who enrolled the couple in the program manually.\n\nIn the end, it was worth the hassle, he said. He was able to get a plan that saves the Messersmiths a small fortune every month. \u201cMy premiums before for my wife and I were $600 a month \u2014 and that was for insurance that wasn\u2019t particularly good, but it was there in case of catastrophic stuff and whatever else.\u201d Under their new plan, the Messersmiths pay $350 a month for \u201cway better insurance,\u201d he said. They have a $750 deductible, which is much lower than what it had been before, plus $250 a month in savings and \u201ca lot less out-of-pocket costs,\u201d he said.\n\nMessersmith hopes the new law means greater freedom \u2014 not just for artists, \u201cbut also for small-business owners and people that want to quit their day job and do their thing,\u201d he said. Now Messersmith is enjoying growing success with the release of his new album \u201cHeart Murmurs,\u201d a gig at the Sundance Film Festival in January, and an extensive tour that includes a stop in the U.K. and shows at the upcoming South by Southwest festival.\n\nLaura Holway & Ben McGinley: Freedom from the \u2018pre-existing conditions\u2019 trap\n\nChoreographer Laura Holway and her husband, Ben McGinley, who works in video production, have been working hard to eke out a living as freelancers. But getting health insurance has been difficult, in part because of their pre-existing conditions, even ones that seem innocuous.\n\nA few years ago, Holway got health insurance through her then-employer, a local restaurant. But when her hours were cut, she found out she was going to lose her coverage. Before that took effect, she decided to get one more physical examination. After that appointment revealed an abnormal pap spear, \u201cNo one would cover me because I had a pre-existing condition,\u201d she said.\n\nHolway was finally able to get very limited care, which amounted to $170 per month \u201cfor basically no coverage,\u201d she said.\n\nIn 2011, when the couple married, a health-insurance broker helped them get a plan with Medica. That lasted for a couple of years.\n\n\u201cThat was pretty reasonable,\u201d said Holway of the insurance, though there was a $6,000 deductible. They liked it because of the low cost per month \u2014 $260 for both of them \u2014 plus the couple got physical and eyecare examinations with their plan, including a $125 credit toward eyeglasses every two years. They also had a $20 co-pay on all physicals. It was \u201ca pretty good situation,\u201d though the downside was that it wouldn\u2019t cover pregnancy, Holway said.\n\nMcGinley had been rejected multiple times for pre-existing conditions, relating to when he quit smoking. That might seem like a step in the right direction, but a prescription for anti-anxiety medication, to help him cope with withdrawal symptoms, turned out to be problematic.\n\nIt was just a one-time prescription, but whenever he tried to change his plan, McGinley was asked about taking anti-anxiety medication. As a result, he was rejected by insurance companies, he said.\n\nLast year, McGinley again tried to switch plans to see if they could get a better rate. This time he was turned away because he\u2019s taken antidepressants.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even have a high standard of what we want,\u201d McGinley said. \u201cWe just want to get physicals and maybe an eye exam. We aren\u2019t choosy shoppers. We are small-business owners who get walloped every year with self-employment tax.\u201d\n\nIn January, the couple knew their Medica plan was going to skyrocket, so they decided to try MNsure.\n\nThey are now on separate plans with different benefits. McGinley\u2019s deductible is set at $3,500 and Holway\u2019s is $1,500. Together, they pay a little over $300 per month \u201cfor pretty good insurance,\u201d Holway said.\n\nJoko Sutrisno: When disaster strikes\n\nJoko Sutrisno, a gamelan musician from Java, Indonesia, who has lived in Minnesota for 20 years, recently enlisted the help of Springboard for the Arts to get health insurance. Using MNsure, Sutrisno was approved for the subsidized program MinnesotaCare \u2014 and none too soon. Last year Sutrisno\u2019s wife had a health emergency, which meant multiple visits to an opthamologist at $300 per visit. \u201cWe were desperate,\u201d he said.\n\nSutrisno learned music from an early age from his father, who was the leader of a musical group in their village. He further studied gamelan at a performing arts high school, eventually moving to New Zealand in the 1980s to work in the Indonesian Embassy as a cultural official and gamelan teacher. In 1995 he learned about an opportunity through the Schubert Club to teach gamelan in Minnesota. \u201cI said, \u2018Minnesota?\u2019 I had to look at the map,\u201d he said.\n\nSutrisno made $500 a month. He also taught at St. Catherine\u2019s University for several years, which paid him $1,000 a year for his family\u2019s health care needs.\n\nBecause it was so little money, Sutrisno found a supplementary program on Lake Street in Minneapolis called Portico, which cost $50 a month, but didn\u2019t cover hospital expenses. The program also charged $10 for doctor visits.\n\nSutrisno says he and his family take care to eat healthily and get enough exercise, so they haven\u2019t had much need for health insurance until the past year, when his wife lost her vision.\n\n\u201cI thought, what do I do?\u201d Sutrisno said. \u201cWe have to do something.\u201d\n\nSutrisno had received Springboard for the Arts\u2019 newsletter, and he knew the organization offered vouchers for visits to an eye doctor. Unfortunately, the vouchers are to see a general doctor first, and the need was urgent.\n\nSpringboard offered to help set the couple up with MNsure, and Sutrisno and his wife qualified for MinnesotaCare. \u201cIt was amazing. Without Springboard\u2019s help, I don\u2019t know what we would do,\u201d he said.\n\nStill skeptical of Obamacare\n\nEven with the Affordable Care Act in place, some artists are choosing to pay the penalty instead of signing up. It may be because they don\u2019t like being told by the government what to do, or because they distrust insurance companies, or because they feel they still can\u2019t afford it.\n\nAmina Harper, a 26-year-old visual artist, has been without health insurance since last year.\n\nWhen she occasionally works for a temp agency, Harper can get temporary access to a bare-bones insurance plan, which varies depending on where she\u2019s working. \u201cAnytime you make money, they take it out of your paycheck,\u201d she said.\n\nLately, Harper hasn\u2019t been getting much temp work, but she plans on holding off getting health insurance because of horror stories she\u2019s heard about people\u2019s experiences with the MNsure website. Harper also says she\u2019s counting on the fact that she\u2019s young and healthy. So far, her health problems have been rare.\n\nHarper is wary of signing up for Obamacare because of the troubles that some of her friends have had signing up. \u201cMy thing is, I\u2019ll sign up if the kinks get worked out,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I\u2019ll give it another year.\u201d\n\nHeather Amos, an actor and a child-care worker, begrudgingly signed up for MinnesotaCare, though she\u2019s concerned about the fact that it doesn\u2019t cover the alternative medication and naturopathy \u2014 treatment she says she needs for Hashimoto\u2019s disease. \u201cI got MinnesotaCare, but it doesn\u2019t cover anything,\u201d she said. \u201cMy medication is $95 a month and my naturopath is out of network. It\u2019s pretty much only good if I go in for a cold or something. And deductibles are really high.\u201d\n\nThat said, Amos was able to get MinnesotaCare in time for a trip to the emergency room, to remove kidney stones.\n\nThough not all artists are ready to join the MNsure system, there\u2019s no doubt it will have an effect on the arts ecosystem in the Twin Cities and on a national scale. Will fewer artists have to choose between paying rent and going to the doctor? Will Obamacare encourage artists to quit their day jobs to pursue freelance careers?
