( Courtesy photo )\n\nJerry Nelson, an internationally-celebrated concert pianist, will perform in Sterling on April 12. The free concert will be held at 10:30 a.m. at Sterling Nazarene Church, 1600 Sidney Ave.\n\nNelson is a composer, arranger, conductor and studio producer, and has performed on all continents. He has teamed up with Dino and Anthony Burger, and accompanied such artists as Glen Campbell, Sandi Patti, Tom Netherton and Steve Amerson.\n\nNelson has conducted orchestras from London and Tel Aviv to Nashville and Los Angeles. His creative touch appears on over 500 recorded projects, working with sons Scott and Brad. His publishing and arranging efforts include several dozen original songs and over 5,000 arrangements.\n\nNelson's first \"official\" assignment was playing piano at age 10 in a small Minnesota church. He began his career in public school music also in Minnesota followed by over three decades arranging and directing orchestra at Denver First Nazarene Church. But today, Nelson and wife Rachel are focused on a full-time concert career.\n\nMuch of the proceeds of their efforts enable occasional trips to the Congo and Zimbabwe where Jerry performs concerts and Rachel works with AIDS victims and training youth peer groups. They also work with humanitarian programs including economical water purification and advanced education for promising youth. Retirement, Nelson says, is not yet on the radar screen.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sterling-religion/ci_27847054/pianist-jerry-nelson-perform-at-sterling-nazarene", "modificationDate": "2015-04-03T23:04:43-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2015/0403/20150403__04ST_jerry_nelson~1_300.jpg", "endDate": "2025-04-03T19:43:11-0600", "description": "Jerry Nelson, an internationally-celebrated concert pianist, will perform in Sterling on April 12.
