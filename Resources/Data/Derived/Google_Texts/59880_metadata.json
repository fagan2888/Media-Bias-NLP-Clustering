It's great to see them reaching out to the Native American communities. Their presence will serve as a reminder to all youth that a college education is a dream that can become a reality,\" said LuAnn Leonard, Arizona Board of Regents member and Executive Director of the Hopi Education Endowment Fund.\n\nASU has one of the highest American Indian student populations in the nation and is a leading university in the country for awarding graduate degrees to American Indian students. In addition, the Tribal Nations Tour was featured as a best practice at the National Indian Education Association Conference and the annual College Board conference.\n\nStudents who are joining this year\u2019s tour will learn about traditional Hopi perspectives on running, dine as Navajos do on roast mutton, participate in a \u201cSun Devils 5k Run and 3k Walk\u201d and learn about Navajo contemporary and traditional culture. Tribal Nations Tour participants will meet with the Hopi Opportunity Youth Initiative, enjoy a Hopi dinner, and learn about the tribe\u2019s culture. The tour is coordinated by the ASU President\u2019s Office of American Indian Initiatives.\n\nJoining the Tribal Nations Tour last year was a meaningful endeavor for Sun Devil Athletics student athletes and staff members who had \u201can incredibly powerful and memorable experience,\u201d said William Kennedy, ASU associate athletic director.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity to engage with the Native American community through service projects and cultural exchanges gave the group an in-depth look and appreciation of the Native American culture,\u201d he added.\n\nSome students are joining the tour again after a great experience last year that proved beneficial to all of the parties involved.\n\n\u201cThe collaboration between the American Indian Initiatives office and the ASU Athletic Department is beneficial in strengthening relationships between the university and Tribal Nations. The partnership demonstrates ASU's commitment to not only attracting American Indian students but also to the improvement of tribal communities,\u201d said Justin Hongeva, who is a member of the Hopi tribe and earning his master\u2019s degree in American Indian Studies at ASU.\n\nASU American Indian students encourage youth to pursue higher education by setting an example and student athletes on the tour promote healthy lifestyles through physical activity. \u201cIn exchange, ASU athletes learn about life on the reservation, which is important as American Indians are very much underrepresented in American society,\u201d Hongeva added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arizona State University American Indian students are traveling with student athletes to Hopi and Navajo lands this weekend to bring the university to tribal nations, learn abou", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "klb678", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/20/asu-tribal-nations-tour-traveling-navajo-and-hopi-nations-wellness-service-projects", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/tribal_nations_tour_2013.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "ASU Tribal Nations Tour Traveling to Navajo and Hopi Nations for Wellness, Service Projects"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-06-20T16:00-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/20/asu-tribal-nations-tour-traveling-navajo-and-hopi-nations-wellness-service-projects", "dc": {"title": "ASU Tribal Nations Tour Traveling to Navajo and Hopi Nations for Wellness, Service Projects"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "ASU Tribal Nations Tour Traveling to Navajo and Hopi Nations for Wellness, Service Projects"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce3f9\"", "article_summary": "Tribal Nations Tour participants will meet with the Hopi Opportunity Youth Initiative, enjoy a Hopi dinner, and learn about the tribe\u2019s culture.\nASU has one of the highest American Indian student populations in the nation and is a leading university in the country for awarding graduate degrees to American Indian students.\nIn addition, the Tribal Nations Tour was featured as a best practice at the National Indian Education Association Conference and the annual College Board conference.\n\u201cThe collaboration between the American Indian Initiatives office and the ASU Athletic Department is beneficial in strengthening relationships between the university and Tribal Nations.\nArizona State University American Indian students are traveling with student athletes to Hopi and Navajo lands this weekend to bring the university to tribal nations, learn about Native cultures and share in healthy activities."}
