TALLAHASSEE, Fla. - Legislation ending permanent alimony for divorcing couples in Florida took a big step forward Tuesday in Tallahassee. The legislation is ready for a vote by the full Senate and State House.

Alimony could soon be calculated by multiplying the number of years in a marriage by the difference between the incomes of the divorcing couple.

"This approach will reduce litigation that inflicts an economic and emotional toll on the spouses and their families," said Sen. Keli Stargel.

The legislation brought dozens of people to Tallahassee as many see it as an attack on wives who gave up everything for their children and a family.

"If a woman stays home for just a few years and takes care of children and then tries to enter the workplace, she’s out of luck," said Barbara DeVane of the National Organization for Women.

But women who have been paying alimony for years longer than the length of their marriages said the change is sorely needed.

"It wasn’t fair," said OBGYN Dr. Natalie Sohn, who is paying alimony. "I won’t be able to retire. I have a very high amount because they based it on my best year ever."

One of the most controversial provisions says 50/50 child custody is the starting place for a judge to consider.

"Do you really want all our children to be raised by day care centers?" asked Karen Librizzi of Brandon Divorce. "Because you’re telling us all just to go to work."

Efforts to make the new formula applicable only to couples who marry after the bill takes effect failed.

Some fear the change will lead to widespread poverty.

The legislation allows the both sides to go back to court when circumstances change.

"If the recipient of alimony is making more money, why does the payer of alimony still pay that same amount?" asked Alan Fricher, president of Family Law reform.

In 2013, Gov. Rick Scott vetoed a similar bill allowing divorced couples to go back into court retroactively.
