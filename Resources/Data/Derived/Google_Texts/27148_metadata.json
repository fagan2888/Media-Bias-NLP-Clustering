The consensus among analysts polled by FactSet was 84 cents.\n\nBut when breaking down the numbers and listening to what Chief Executive Officer Steve Fredrickson has to say, you can\u2019t help but consider putting money in this small-cap company. After all, the stock has more than doubled the returns of its index in the past five years. And it\u2019s not in an inherently risky business like some other small-caps.\n\nPortfolio Recovery Associates Inc. PRAA, +0.37% of Norfolk, Va., buys portfolios of nonperforming or charged-off loans, mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom. The company has a deal in place to expand its operations in Europe through the purchase of Aktiv Kapital of Oslo for $880 million in cash. Portfolio Recovery Associates will also take on Aktiv Kapital\u2019s debt of $435 million, for a total value of $1.3 billion. The purchase is expected to be completed by the end of June and is being funded through a combination of cash on hand and borrowing.\n\nWhen the deal was announced in February, CEO Steve Fredrickson said he expected the \u201ctransformative\u201d deal to be \u201cimmediately accretive to earnings.\u201d\n\nThe business of buying servicing rights for stressed mortgage-loan portfolios in the U.S. boomed after the credit crisis of 2008, with many players, including Ocwen Financial Inc. OCN, +6.18% expanding exponentially by buying huge blocks of servicing rights from several of the nation\u2019s largest lenders. The mortgage servicers are now under a great deal of scrutiny, with New York Superintendent of Financial Services Benjamin Lawsky saying in a speech Tuesday that he remained concerned over the expansion of mortgage servicers, and that his department would broaden its investigations.\n\nPortfolio Recovery Associates is different from Ocwen because, in addition to providing collection and related services (including repossession and skip tracing) to banks, governments and retailers, it buys pools of problem loans (not just the servicing rights) at a discount, and then seeks to recover as much as possible through collection efforts. Because it owns these portfolios and doesn\u2019t resell them, the company can be patient with recovery efforts.\n\nAt this point in the credit cycle, \u201cthe supply of available debt to acquire in the U.S. remains lower in years past,\u201d Fredrickson said in the company\u2019s first-quarter earnings press release, which helps explain the need for a massive expansion into Europe.\n\nJanney Capital Markets analyst Sameer Gokhale upgraded Portfolio Recovery Associates to \u201cbuy\u201d from \u201cneutral,\u201d with a fair value estimate of $60, implying 11% upside from Thursday\u2019s closing price of $53.03. Of eight analysts who cover the company, six have \u201cbuy\u201d ratings and two \u201chold\u201d ratings.\n\nThe shares look cheap, trading for 11.4 times the consensus 2015 EPS estimate of $4.64. The consensus 2014 EPS estimate is $3.87. Still, the stock is flat year-to-date through Thursday, following a 48% return in 2013 and a 58% surge in 2012. The stock\u2019s five-year total return is 385%, more than double that of the S&P 600 SmallCap Index.\n\nHere\u2019s a more interesting point for investors looking ahead \u2014 Portfolio Recovery Associates\u2019 first-quarter return on common equity (ROCE) was 21.38%, increasing from 20.37% a year earlier, according to FactSet. The 2013 ROCE was higher, at 22.22%, but the first-quarter number is very impressive, and the consistent ROCEs above 20 mean there\u2019s plenty of support for the stock price and plenty of earnings to support its expansion. Meanwhile, the company has grown its annual sales per share for 10 straight years, which takes us back to 2005, well before the U.S. credit crisis began.\n\nFredrickson in February said he expected the Aktiv deal to help Portfolio Recovery Associates \u201cmeet or exceed our twin goals of 20% ROE and 15% EPS growth, delivering long-term shareholder value through the years ahead.\u201d If he is right in this prediction, investors have an opportunity to buy a long-term winner at a discount.\n\nPortfolio Recovery Associates\u2019 financing of the Aktiv deal through debt is good news for shareholders, who aren\u2019t being diluted by a deal that is expected to add to earnings this year. According to Gokhale, Portfolio Recovery Associates\u2019 leverage following the Aktiv deal and associated borrowings will be \u201capproximately two times debt-to-adjusted EBITDA (including their deferred tax liability as debt).\u201d\n\nThe analyst believes the company could decide to lever up further, to 3.1 times EBITDA, which would free up an additional $1 billion that could be deployed through more acquisitions, purchases of debt portfolios or share buybacks.\n\nGokhale also sees another possible growth opportunity for Portfolio Recovery Associates, since there is \u201cthe chance that three of the large debt sellers who exited the market could start selling charged-off receivables in 2014 or 2015.\u201d\n\nMore must-reads from MarketWatch:\n\n5 \u2018dividend champ\u2019 stocks with the highest yields\n\nCharles Schwab, the man, is an ETF fan\n\nValue stocks for investors who fear the worst\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "An expansion into Europe is about to reignite this company\u2019s earnings, writes Phil van Doorn.", "creator": "@PhilipvanDoorn", "image": {"width": 280, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CF886_PRA_20_MD_20140523095334.jpg", "height": 187}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "parsely-author": "Philip van Doorn", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-05-23T13:35:00-04:00", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/repo-man-stock-recovers-money-for-investors-2014-05-23", "author": "Philip van Doorn", "parsely-title": "Repo-man stock recovers money for investors", "description": "An expansion into Europe is about to reignite this company\u2019s earnings, writes Phil van Doorn.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "article.section": "Investing", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Investing", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "An expansion into Europe is about to reignite this company\u2019s earnings, writes Phil van Doorn.", "title": "Repo-man stock recovers money for investors", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/repo-man-stock-recovers-money-for-investors-2014-05-23", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CF886_PRA_20_MD_20140523095334.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CF886_PRA_20_MD_20140523095334.jpg"}, "article.id": "2F8B4B8C-E287-11E3-9B78-00212803FAD6", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb3a6\"", "article_summary": "Portfolio Recovery Associates is a hot, but little-known, stock, up more than 3% today after an upgrade by Janney Capital Markets.\nHere\u2019s a more interesting point for investors looking ahead \u2014 Portfolio Recovery Associates\u2019 first-quarter return on common equity (ROCE) was 21.38%, increasing from 20.37% a year earlier, according to FactSet.\nPortfolio Recovery Associates will also take on Aktiv Kapital\u2019s debt of $435 million, for a total value of $1.3 billion.\nPortfolio Recovery Associates Inc.
