One of television's newest reality stars is home in Bay County this weekend and she spent part of her homecoming giving back to the community that raised her.

Maja Sly is a cast member on WETV's "Cutting It: In The ATL," a reality show about hair salon owners in Atlanta.

Today, Sly hosted her first "Vallard's day in the Bay," named in honor of her late uncle who raised her in Springfield.

Kids from pre-school to high school got backpacks filled with school supplies to start the year on the right foot.

"It's such a humbling experience to be able to give back," explained Sly. "Growing up here I was raised in a housing project in a trailer park. Just being able to see beyond my own circumstances and just getting a very good education, I went to Springfield, Everitt, Rutherford High School and I went on to college. I was equipped to do everything that I needed to do to be able to excel."
