50 never looked so good!

It was party time at the Phoenix Zoo Saturday, as zoo officials and visitors celebrated the 50th birthday of Indu, the zoo's Asian elephant.

Indu was treated to extra TLC from her keepers and received a delicious birthday cake made of beet juice, along with red and purple Gatorade. It was filled with bananas, oranges and roses!

Guests came out to celebrate the golden gal's birthday and brought gifts cards (which will be used by her keepers to provide items for the exhibit and for enrichment), popcorn and spices.

But other animals at the zoo were not left out of the fun. Many animals enjoyed holiday treats. Some of those taking part were the orangutans, who received presents filled with oatmeal and honey. They even enjoyed a decorated tree!
