It is not known if layoffs took place at any of Barnabas' other nine hospitals or ancillary facilities.\n\nBarnabas employs more than 19,000 people and more than 4,700 physicians, and is looking to expand its footprint in New Jersey. In May, it took over Jersey City Medical Center in Hudson County.\n\nBut Barry Ostrowsky, president and chief executive officer, recently spoke of revenue pressures becoming a greater challenge, in part, because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHospitals across the country are trying to figure out how the new law, colloquially known as \"Obamacare,\" will impact their revenues. The New Jersey Hospitals Association estimated that cuts to Medicare, written into the new law, will cost $4.5 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nWhat isn't known is how much additional revenue will come in from the hundreds of thousands of additionally insured patients. About 1 million New Jerseyans will be eligible for either Medicaid or health insurance on the new federally-run exchanges because of \"Obamacare.\" Enrollment begins Oct. 1 and coverage begins Jan. 1.\n\n\"Healthcare reform, in combination with Medicare cuts, more patients seeking outpatient care and decreasing patient volumes a spokeswoman for Barnabas said in a statement. \"As a result, we have made the difficult decision to reduce our workforce. Decisions like this are never easy and we are working with these employees to help them look for other opportunities within the Barnabas Health system.\"\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@am-newsletter','@river','belleville','essex-county','health-news','ocean-county','toms-river'", "title": "Barnabas Health lays off employees, cites healthcare reform", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Barnabas Health lays off employees, cites healthcare reform\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/clara_maass_lays_off_dozens_of_employees.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/13014980-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11230246\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-09-12T23:11:00Z\", \"author\": \"Dan Goldberg | The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@am-newsletter\",\"@river\",\"belleville\",\"essex-county\",\"health-news\",\"ocean-county\",\"toms-river\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/politics_impact/photo/13014980-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "The company refused to say the total number of employees who lost their jobs but layoffs have occurred at Clara Maass Health Center in Belleville and Community Medical Center in Toms River.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, September 12, 2013, 10:09 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/politics_impact/photo/ad-4-clara-desk-munsonjpg-71911705bd6e1b46.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dgoldberg\", \"author_nickname\": \"Dan Goldberg | The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"8007378\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "The company refused to say the total number of employees who lost their jobs but layoffs have occurred at Clara Maass Health Center in Belleville and Community Medical Center in Toms River.", "title": "Barnabas Health lays off employees, cites healthcare reform", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/09/clara_maass_lays_off_dozens_of_employees.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, September 12, 2013,  6:59 PM", "article_author": "Dan Goldberg | The Star-Ledger", "Description": "The company refused to say the total number of employees who lost their jobs but layoffs have occurred at Clara Maass Health Center in Belleville and Community Medical Center in Toms River."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8c7\"", "article_summary": "BELLEVILLE \u2014 Barnabas Health, the second-largest private employer in the state, said today it was forced to lay off employees because of pressures brought about by healthcare reform.\nDecisions like this are never easy and we are working with these employees to help them look for other opportunities within the Barnabas Health system.\"\nBut Barry Ostrowsky, president and chief executive officer, recently spoke of revenue pressures becoming a greater challenge, in part, because of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe company refused to say the total number of employees who lost their jobs but layoffs have occurred at Clara Maass Health Center in Belleville and Community Medical Center in Toms River.\n\"Healthcare reform, in combination with Medicare cuts, more patients seeking outpatient care and decreasing patient volumes a spokeswoman for Barnabas said in a statement."}
