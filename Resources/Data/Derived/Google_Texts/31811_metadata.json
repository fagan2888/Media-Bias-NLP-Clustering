Miller, who was found in violation of the league\u2019s drug policy, did have to forfeit $806,161 of his 2013 salary as part of the settlement, but the Broncos understood he would also have to pay back $1,215,264 of his $13,773,000 signing bonus he received in 2011 as the NFL\u2019s No. 2 overall draft pick, as part of a collective bargaining agreement.\n\nThe settlement between the league and Miller\u2019s representatives, however, made no mention of the signing bonus. An independent mediator heard the case and both sides have been informed Miller will be able to keep a little more than $1 million of that bonus but not quite the full $1.215 million, according to two NFL sources. ESPN first reported Miller would keep the bulk of his signing bonus. Such an \u201caward\u201d may be unprecedented as suspended players ordinarily do have to pay back pro-rated portions of upfront bonuses.\n\nA negotiated settlement, though, apparently falls outside the CBA jurisdiction.\n\nThe Broncos, who were not part of the settlement negotiations, will seek clarification from the league office on the matter at a later date. The team has been busy with other matters, like the Super Bowl. Miller won\u2019t play in the Super Bowl on Sunday because he suffered a torn ACL in his right knee in the Broncos\u2019 15th game at Houston.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Von Miller", "language": "en, sv", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Broncos linebacker Von Miller will keep most of the signing bonus he got as the No. 2 overall draft pick despite a suspension for violating the drug policy.", "title": "Von Miller signing bonus: Broncos linebacker to keep most of it", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/02/02/von-miller-gets-keep-roughly-1-million-signing-bonus/26215/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/02/von-miller-afc-championship-495.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Broncos linebacker Von Miller will keep most of the signing bonus he got as the No. 2 overall draft pick despite a suspension for violating the drug policy.", "title": "Von Miller to keep bulk of Broncos signing bonus despite suspension", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/02/02/von-miller-gets-keep-roughly-1-million-signing-bonus/26215/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/02/von-miller-afc-championship-495.jpg", "creator": "@mikeklis", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Broncos linebacker Von Miller will keep most of the signing bonus he got as the No. 2 overall draft pick despite a suspension for violating the drug policy."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda37d\"", "article_summary": "JERSEY CITY, N.J. \u2014 We\u2019re starting to understand that the six-game suspension Broncos linebacker Von Miller received to start the season could have been worse.\nThe suspension was part of a settlement worked out between the NFL and Miller\u2019s NFL Players Association lawyers.\nMiller won\u2019t play in the Super Bowl on Sunday because he suffered a torn ACL in his right knee in the Broncos\u2019 15th game at Houston.\nThe Broncos, who were not part of the settlement negotiations, will seek clarification from the league office on the matter at a later date.\nThe settlement between the league and Miller\u2019s representatives, however, made no mention of the signing bonus."}
