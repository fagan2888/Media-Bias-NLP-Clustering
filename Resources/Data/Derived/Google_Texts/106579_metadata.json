The Nets made the playoffs every year since relocating for the 2012-13 season, but they are 10-27, better only than the league-worst Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nKing had been GM since 2010, orchestrating a number of high-profile moves that led to just one playoff series victory. Hollins was in his second season as coach.\n\nKing worked hard to fulfill Prokhorov\u2019s goal of winning a championship within five years of buying the team in 2010, making blockbuster trades that brought in Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett.\n\nOnly Johnson remains, as the Nets decided to cut costs after at one point owning the largest payroll in league history. But they haven\u2019t been competitive now and have little hope of a quick fix in the future, as their first-round pick next season goes to Boston as part of the payment from the deal that brought Pierce and Garnett in 2013.\n\n\u201cAt every step of the way, he has been aggressive in his quest to build a winning team and has been a key factor toward the Nets making the playoffs for each of the last three seasons,\u201d Prokhorov said of King, who was in the last year of his contract.\n\nProkhorov is scheduled to hold a news conference Monday. The Russian billionaire recently agreed to a deal with developer Bruce Ratner to buy the remaining portion of the team he didn\u2019t already own and now wants to strengthen it.\n\n\u201cWe have learned a great deal during the past six years and our experiences will guide us for the future,\u201d Prokhorov said. \u201cFollowing the consolidation of team ownership last month, I can assure you that I\u2019m more determined and committed than ever to build a winner.\u201d\n\nKing\u2019s win-now approach to deals started with the package sent to Utah in 2011 for Williams, whose contract was bought out last summer with two years remaining. A swap with Portland for Gerald Wallace cost the Nets the pick that turned into Damian Lillard, and they don\u2019t control their own first-round choice until 2019 thanks to the trade with Boston.\n\nHollins went 48-71 and, like predecessors Avery Johnson, P.J. Carlesimo and Jason Kidd, didn\u2019t last long in Brooklyn. The former Memphis Grizzlies coach got the Nets to the No. 8 seed in the Eastern Conference last season, but they dropped their first seven games in this one and haven\u2019t won at home in a month.\n\nThose home struggles and a roster loaded with lesser names have created a big drop in interest in Brooklyn, where there have been empty seats all over the arena this season. It will be hard for the new regime to change much quickly, unless the Nets can score a big name in free agency.\n\nProkhorov thanked the fans in his statement and said bright days are ahead.\n\n\u201cWe have learned a great deal during the past six years and our experiences will guide us for the future,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Lionel Hollins fired as Nets\u2019 coach, Brooklyn reassigns GM Billy King", "title": "Lionel Hollins fired as Nets\u2019 coach, Brooklyn reassigns GM Billy King", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/10/lionel-hollins-fired-as-nets-coach-brooklyn-reassigns-gm-billy-king/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160110_100211_lionel-hollins.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160110_100211_lionel-hollins.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-10T10:22:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T21:16:26+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c17\"", "article_summary": "The Nets reassigned their general manager and fired coach Lionel Hollins on Sunday in the midst of their worst season since moving from New Jersey.\n\u201cWe have learned a great deal during the past six years and our experiences will guide us for the future,\u201d Prokhorov said.\nThe Nets said assistant Tony Brown will serve as the interim head coach, and the GM position will remain open until a replacement is hired.\nKing had been GM since 2010, orchestrating a number of high-profile moves that led to just one playoff series victory.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear from our current state of affairs that we need new leadership,\u201d owner Mikhail Prokhorov said in a statement."}
