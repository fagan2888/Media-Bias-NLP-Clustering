(Courtesy Bob Littlefield)\n\nAhead of Tuesday\u2019s primary election, local Republican candidates in Arizona are getting tied to President Obama.\n\nBob Littlefield (R), a Scottsdale City Council member running for the state House of Representatives, was accused of being an Obama ally in a mailer sent out by a group called the Arizona Free Enterprise Club. On the mailer, Littlefield is Photoshopped next to Obama and U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D) and described as \u201cLiberal Bob Littlefield\u2026 Good news for Democrats. Bad news for Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese folks know they can\u2019t beat us on the facts, so they\u2019re trying an emotional appeal,\u201d Littlefield told The Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s fear mongering.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Arizona Free Enterprise Club did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLittlefield said that he\u2019s not the only candidate to be featured in mailers tying Republicans to Obama and that these tactics have caught on in the state.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s started this king of trend,\u201d he said.\n\nHow to run a Republican primary race in Arizona: tie your opponent to \"Obama-like taxes\" pic.twitter.com/V3iTZ3UWie \u2014 Hunter Schwarz (@hunterschwarz) July 26, 2014\n\nDoug Little (R), a candidate for corporate commission, has been accused of supporting \u201cObama-like taxes\u201d in signs posted around the Phoenix area, and other candidates have seen signs with bright red arrows reading \u201cvoted for Obamacare\u201d placed next to their campaign signs.\n\nPhoto: Here's what the Obamacare Republicans are doing to our signs!

Bob Robson (R), who was accused Monday of removing one of these signs by Maricopa County sheriff\u2019s officers.\n\nRobson received a traffic ticket and complaint from the officers, who said he had removed a \u201cvote for Obamacare\u201d sign from his own yard. His attorney called it \u201chokey.\u201d Robson never removed any signs from his yard, Ryan said, and even if he had, he was within his rights. Arizona law allows people to remove signs placed on their own property.\n\nThe signs don\u2019t indicate who is responsible for them, but they\u2019ve been put up by a group called Arizona Taxpayer Action, according to the Arizona Republic. A Twitter account for that group has been tweeting images of the signs. A spokesperson for the Arizona Taxpayer Action did not respond to phone calls requesting comment.\n\nRobson was one of 14 Republicans in the state legislature who voted to support Gov. Jan Brewer (R) in expanding the state\u2019s Medicaid program, something primary opponents across the state have tried to capitalize on, lumping these Republicans together with Obama and the Affordable Care Act, Ryan said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a joke because it\u2019s not Obamacare,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cEveryone is accusing their opponent of supporting Obama.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Campaign signs and mailers for local races are accusing Republicans of being the president's ally or supporting Obamacare.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/hunter.schwarz?fref=ts", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Campaign signs and mailers for local races are accusing Republicans of being the president's ally or supporting Obamacare.", "title": "Tying your Republican primary opponent to Obama is all the rage in Arizona", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/08/22/tying-your-republican-primary-opponent-to-obama-is-all-the-rage-in-arizona/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/files/2014/08/Evil-Mailer-Front.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@hunterschwarz"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/08/22/tying-your-republican-primary-opponent-to-obama-is-all-the-rage-in-arizona/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Arizona, Obama, Obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/hunter.schwarz?fref=ts"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Arizona, Obama, Obamacare"}, "article_summary": "(Courtesy Bob Littlefield)Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primary election, local Republican candidates in Arizona are getting tied to President Obama.\nA spokesperson for the Arizona Taxpayer Action did not respond to phone calls requesting comment.\nA mailer accuses Arizona House candidate Bob Littlefield of being an ally of Obama.\nThe signs don\u2019t indicate who is responsible for them, but they\u2019ve been put up by a group called Arizona Taxpayer Action, according to the Arizona Republic.\nOn the mailer, Littlefield is Photoshopped next to Obama and U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D) and described as \u201cLiberal Bob Littlefield\u2026 Good news for Democrats."}
