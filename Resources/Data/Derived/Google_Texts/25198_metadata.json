(Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\n4712643\n\nObamacare exchanges had a net loss total of 238,119 enrollees in 29 states and the District of Columbia within the three-month period between the end of March and end of June.\n\nAccording to analysis the Washington-based Americans for Tax Reform (ATR), numbers released from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) show that enrollment in all 50 states and DC as of June 31 is at 9.9 million. This number is down from 10.2 million on March 31.\n\nFlorida lost 101,091 enrollees, Georgia 34,925, North Carolina 32,300, Pennsylvania 29,487, Texas 23,194, New Jersey 14,273, Indiana 13,268, and Arizona 10,905.\n\n\u201cThe poor performance of the program is bad news for the long-term sustainability of the federal and state Obamacare exchanges given their reliance on paying enrollees to meet costs,\u201d ATR explained.\n\n\u201cExchanges typically fund their operations through a fee on premiums: the federal exchange that provides 37 states with coverage charges a 3.5 percent premium, while state exchanges are free to choose their own rate. Fewer enrollees could signal the beginning of a death spiral for the Obamacare exchanges,\u201d according to ATR.\n\nMany state exchanges, however, are also reportedly in disarray. Reason Magazine reports that while the federal government \u201cspent billions on creating Obamacare\u2019s exchanges\u201d it did not track the money appropriately, and many of the state-run exchanges are not working.\n\nAccording to a Government Accountability Office report, only Vermont completed work on technology to send data to the IRS, while only 10 other states were partially complete. Additionally, Hawaii and Minnesota performed no testing at all on their exchange systems.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kerry Picket", "description": "Obamacare exchanges had a net loss total of 238,119 enrollees in 29 states and the District of Columbia within the three-month period between the end of March", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Obamacare exchanges had a net loss total of 238,119 enrollees in 29 states and the District of Columbia within the three-month period between the end of March and end of June.
