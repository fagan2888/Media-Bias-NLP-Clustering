Kennedy, it has become a clich\u00e9 to call it the first fully televised tragedy. But it\u2019s hard for us to grasp how the continuous coverage impacted a generation that had never before received this kind of news in this kind of way.\n\n\u201cThe relative newness of the television phenomenon required Americans to grapple with the uncanniness, as well as the anguish, of what they were going through,\u201d writes Aniko Bodroghkozy of the University of Virginia\u2019s Media Studies Department. \u201cAmericans constructed a very particular set of relationships with television as they endured the emotional nadir of that four-day \u2018black weekend.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the journal Television and New Media, Bodroghkozy describes and analyzes responses to the coverage as conveyed in correspondence from viewers to NBC news. She looked at 126 such letters collected in anchor David Brinkley\u2019s papers and another 300 in a collection of anchor Chet Huntley.\n\nWhat she found is fascinating both for its tone\u2014overwhelmingly somber and appreciative\u2014and for what it left out.\n\n\u201cVery few viewers express much interest in Lee Harvey Oswald, and there is no discussion about conspiracy,\u201d Bodroghkozy writes. \u201cOnce the absolute shock and horror of the news that Kennedy had been killed began to sink in on Nov. 22, television viewers, from the evidence of those letters, appeared to have quickly moved into a phase of grief and mourning.\u201d\n\nAnd leading that mourning were the network news anchors. Of course, they hardly saw that as their role. Bodroghkozy notes that, in 1963, showing emotion was considered unprofessional for a television journalist. We\u2019ve all seen the clip of a clearly shaken Walter Cronkite announce Kennedy\u2019s death on CBS, but we sometimes fail to remember how quickly he regained his composure and returned to his just-the-facts style.\n\nIn spite of this reserve, however, viewers \u201carticulated a powerful emotional closeness between themselves and the network anchors and reporters,\u201d she writes. \u201cOver and over again, viewers referred to the newsmen as close friends coming together with viewers to share their mutual grief.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Letters sent to NBC news anchors reveal an appreciation for their work -- and no discussion of conspiracy theories", "author": "Tom Jacobs", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Letters sent to NBC news anchors reveal an appreciation for their work -- and no discussion of conspiracy theories", "title": "Before truthers: How JFK assassination coverage united us all", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/17/how_television_reporting_on_jfk_brought_us_together_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/john_f_kennedy2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Letters sent to NBC news anchors reveal an appreciation for their work -- and no discussion of conspiracy theories", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/john_f_kennedy2.jpg", "title": "Before truthers: How JFK assassination coverage united us all", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Before truthers: How JFK assassination coverage united us all", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, JFK, JFK assassination, Media, Pacific Standard", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd81e\"", "article_summary": "Topics: JFK, JFK assassination, Media, Pacific Standard, News, Politics NewsThis piece originally appeared on Pacific Standard.\n\u201cVery few viewers express much interest in Lee Harvey Oswald, and there is no discussion about conspiracy,\u201d Bodroghkozy writes.\nIn the 50 years since the assassination of President John F.
