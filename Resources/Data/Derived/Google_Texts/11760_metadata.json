Summers, the museum\u2019s president. The museum is the brainchild of the Green family, owners of the Hobby Lobby craft store chain, which sued the government for a religious exemption to the contraception mandate and won.\n\nREAD: Hobby Lobby\u2019s Steve Green\u2019s Bible curriculum is a hit in Israeli schools\n\nJustices ruled in the 2014 Supreme Court case that the chain did not have to comply with an Affordable Care Act provision that required the company to insure employees of the craft store empire for a wide range of birth control.\n\nConstruction on the $400 million museum began in 2015, about three blocks from the U.S. Capitol. Though the Greens are evangelical Christians, they say the museum will not preach to visitors, but rather explain the impact, history and influence of the Bible.\n\nThis latest collaboration comes on the heels of the introduction of a Bible curriculum \u2014 developed by the museum \u2014 to 16 Israeli high schools.\n\nPlans to use the curriculum in an Oklahoma school district were shelved last November, though, after opposition surfaced from the Freedom From Religion Foundation and Americans United for Separation of Church and State.\n\nYS/MG END MARKOE", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beliefs, Evangelical, Israel Antiquities Authority, Judaism, Museum of the Bible", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "WASHINGTON (RNS) A Christian family's ambitious Bible museum project has forged a key alliance with the Israel Antiquities Authority, giving treasures from the Holy Land a temporary home just steps from the National Mall.", "title": "Museum of the Bible allies with Israeli antiquities agency", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/08/18/museum-bible-allies-israeli-antiquities-agency/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/thumbRNS-MUSEUM-BIBLE092614b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary", "creator": "@lmarkoe"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/08/18/museum-bible-allies-israeli-antiquities-agency/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/08/18/museum-bible-allies-israeli-antiquities-agency/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "WASHINGTON (RNS) A Christian family's ambitious Bible museum project has forged a key alliance with the Israel Antiquities Authority, giving treasures from the Holy Land a temporary home just steps from the National Mall."}, "article_summary": "This latest collaboration comes on the heels of the introduction of a Bible curriculum \u2014 developed by the museum \u2014 to 16 Israeli high schools.\nWASHINGTON (RNS) A Christian family\u2019s ambitious Bible museum project has forged a key alliance with the Israel Antiquities Authority, giving treasures from the Holy Land a temporary home just steps from the National Mall.\nConstruction on the $400 million museum began in 2015, about three blocks from the U.S. Capitol.\nThe agreement between the planned Museum of the Bible and the authority will allow for the display of a selection of ancient artifacts from the 2 million belonging to the antiquities authority.\nThe museum is the brainchild of the Green family, owners of the Hobby Lobby craft store chain, which sued the government for a religious exemption to the contraception mandate and won."}
