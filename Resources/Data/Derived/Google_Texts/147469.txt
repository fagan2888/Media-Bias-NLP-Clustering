UnitedHealth, Ochsner contract negotiations unsuccessful

UnitedHealthcare and New Orleans-based Ochsner Health System failed to come to a contract agreement last week regarding the payer's Compass program, the plan United offers on the Affordable Care Act exchanges, reports WWLTV.

Below are three things to know.

1. Around 29,000 Louisiana residents have insurance through United's Compass program. About 3,000 of those members currently use Ochsner providers for medical services.

2. Ochsner and UnitedHealthcare's in-network contract expires May 15, after which the system will charge out-of-network fees for Compass policyholders.

3. Although the two entities were unable to reach an agreement Friday, both the health system and insurer said they could still negotiate a deal before the May 15 termination date.
