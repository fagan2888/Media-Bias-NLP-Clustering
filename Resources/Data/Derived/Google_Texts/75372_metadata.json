But perhaps even more surprising is the fact that in Fairfield County, barriers to preventative care and late-stage treatment persist for those lacking insurance.\n\n\u201cEven in this day of the Affordable Health Care Act we still have patients who are uninsured \u2013 patients who can\u2019t afford to pay their deductibles or premiums or even their co-pays,\u201d said Mark Melendez, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon with offices in Fairfield, Shelton and Greenwich.\n\nMelendez, also a member of the Connecticut board of directors for the Susan G. Komen Foundation \u2013 the largest organization dedicated to ridding breast cancer \u2013 recently presented findings from Komen\u2019s \u201c2015 Community Profile: An Assessment of Breast Cancer in Connecticut,\u201d at a press conference at the state capitol in Hartford on Feb. 29. The study detailed not only the state\u2019s unusual high rates of breast cancer, but also the socioeconomic factors that skew treatment and access.\n\n\u201cWe can say we are among the top five states in the United States with a high incidence of breast cancer,\u201d Melendez said.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2012 Connecticut ranked fifth in the nation for incidence rates of breast cancer at 136 per 100,000. This rate was only slightly less than Massachusetts and Washington with 137 cases per 100,000 and closely trailing the most breast cancer ridden states of Hawaii and South Dakota with 140 and 141 cases per 100,000, respectively.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2012, Fairfield County had the most cases of breast cancer throughout the state with New Haven County closely behind. No other county in the state came close to the incidence rates of the two counties, according to the U.S. National Cancer Institute.\n\n\u201cThe first question people ask is \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d Melendez said.\n\nLisa McCooey, director of the comprehensive cancer program under the Department of Public Health, said the answer is not easy to determine.\n\nBoth McCooey and Melendez point to Fairfield County\u2019s high population density and wealth as possible contributing factors.\n\n\u201cFairfield County is a wealthier part of the state,\u201d McCooey said. \u201cPeople tend to have health insurance because they have jobs and those people tend to avail themselves of screening opportunities.\u201d\n\nThis is further compounded by the relatively high density of health care providers in the county, she said.\n\nBut the causes of breast cancer are numerous, Melendez said.\n\n\u201cIt is not just age and family history, but it could be environmental and it could be genetic,\u201d he said.\n\nStudies have been done to find possible connections between industrial production and nuclear power plants, but none have been able to identify a link, Melendez said.\n\n\u201cEnvironmental concerns are always a possibility,\u201d McCooey said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t know enough about it, there is no cause and effect.\u201d\n\nMcCooey said that other factors peculiar to Fairfield might also play a role in the high-incidence rates.\n\n\u201cWomen of higher socioeconomic status tend to have children at later ages and a risk factor for breast cancer is not having children at all or waiting until after 30 to have your first child,\u201d she said.\n\nBoth Melendez and McCooey cite findings in the study that indicate with greater access to health care comes more detection of breast cancer, but that this access is not evenly distributed throughout the county.\n\n\u201cConnecticut is home to immense diversity and with it, immense disparity,\u201d Komen\u2019s community profile states. \u201cEvidence suggests that while white women were far more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer, Black/African-American women were significantly more likely to die from breast cancer if diagnosed. Such increased death may be related to higher late-stage diagnosis amongst Black/African-American and Hispanic/Latina women.\u201d\n\nThe study and its participants identified several barriers to screening and treatment, such as limited transportation options, the need for translation services, inadequate insurance, lack of breast health education and busy work schedules. The study found that the most common theme among all focus groups was that the lack of insurance prevented many women from accessing routine screenings.\n\nAccording to the study, most participants were uninformed about programs that offered free and low cost breast cancer screenings to uninsured and underinsured women. Women reported accessing the free and low-cost screening programs well after they noticed a symptom that they interpreted as being cancerous. In Fairfield and Litchfield counties, women reported having a concern about their breast health and neglecting it due to lack of insurance to access services.\n\nTaking time off from work was also a major concern for women when considering when they can obtain health screenings. Women in Fairfield, Litchfield and New London Counties expressed their primary concern was requesting the time off from work. If sick days were available, they were considered best used for when they were sick and not for early detection screening. Getting screened was not perceived as a measure to detect cancer early.\n\n\u201cThe backbone of the failure to provide access is education,\u201d Melendez said.\n\nThe Komen Foundation agrees and listed several objectives in its 2016 action plan centered on increasing education and awareness, particularly among minority and underserved residents.\n\nMcCooey said from a state level, increased engagement with underserved communities can be achieved though measures such as increasing the number of mobile mammography vehicles that can bring screening directly to underserved communities.\n\nThe community profile found that while the Affordable Care Act has made health care more accessible and affordable for greater portions of the population than before, many Connecticut residents prioritize covering the cost of basic needs over health insurance.\n\n\u201cWhat we want to do from a state level is to go and try to find the women who are not currently engaged in the health care system,\u201d she said.\n\nMelendez adds that there are also structural challenges that are further impeding treatment, particularly within his field of medicine.\n\nMelendez said there are very few plastic surgeons who will provide service strictly to Medicare and Medicaid patients due to the low reimbursement rates.\n\n\u201cAs much as we want to be altruistic and heartfelt in what we do, there has to be some type of guideline,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t fill your whole practice with Medicare and Medicaid patients. I am probably one of the few plastic surgeons to take Medicare and Medicaid. I am doing this because I have given half of my life, literally, to do what I do. It is not driven by financial gain, but in the long term I do have to pay the bills and take care of my family.\u201d\n\nPrint", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "susan g. komen,breast cnacer,fairfield county high breast cancer rates,connecticut breast cancer,dr. mark melendez,breast cancer", "description": "Fairfield County has been cited for high rates of breast cancer, but the impact of the disease differ greatly along lines of race and wealth within the county.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe can say we are among the top five states in the United States with a high incidence of breast cancer,\u201d Melendez said.\n\u201cEvidence suggests that while white women were far more likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer, Black/African-American women were significantly more likely to die from breast cancer if diagnosed.\nThe study detailed not only the state\u2019s unusual high rates of breast cancer, but also the socioeconomic factors that skew treatment and access.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2012 Connecticut ranked fifth in the nation for incidence rates of breast cancer at 136 per 100,000.\nIt has long been known that Connecticut has higher incidence rates of breast cancer in women and men than most of the nation."}
