His administration comes close to such a threat \u0097 \u0093blackmail,\u0094 is the word used by Lieutenant Governor Daniel Patrick of Texas. But it doesn\u0092t formally state that it is going to withhold funds. We\u0092re just making a guess here, but maybe the administration remembers what happened when Obamacare got to the Supreme Court.\n\nOne of the things the court did in that case is block the federal attempt to force the states to heel on Medicaid. The Affordable Care Act attempted to do that for states that wouldn\u0092t expand Medicaid; it would have punished them by withholding other Medicaid funding. The Nine balked. \u0093When Congress threatens to terminate other grants as a means of pressuring the States to accept a Spending Clause program, the legislation runs counter to this Nation\u0092s system of federalism,\u0094 the court said.\n\nThe decision of the court \u0097 the case is known as National Federation v. Sebelius \u0097 is more famous for allowing the individual mandate to go forward under the taxing power. The threat to withhold Medicaid funding, by contrast, was cashiered not just by the right-wingers on the court but also by two of the court\u0092s liberal luminaries, Justices Kagan and Breyer. They joined the Chief Justice and the conservatives in an opinion that used astonishingly blunt language to bring the Obama administration up short.\n\nChief Justice Roberts went so far as to use the phrase \u0093economic dragooning\u0094 that leaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion. What we particularly like about the decision is the pride of place it gave to the very concept of federalism. The court quoted its own language in an earlier case, in which it ruled that\u0093[t]hough Congress\u0092 power to legislate under the spending power is broad, it does not include surprising participating States with post-acceptance or \u0091retroactive\u0092 conditions.\u0094\n\nIt\u0092s not our purpose here to opine one way or another on the question of what bathrooms transgender pupils are entitled to use (we don\u0092t mind saying that we can see serious arguments on both sides of the question). And it\u0092s always going to be dangerous to cite National Federation v. Sebelius as precedent, given that it\u0092s such a dog\u0092s breakfast of illogic, internal contradiction, and politics disguised as jurisprudence. All the more remarkable, though, is the combination of justices who put the brakes on Secretary Sebelius.\n\nThe sages are in agreement that once the federal government enacts funding for a program, it can\u0092t start attaching conditions to the money willy-nilly and retroactively. Nor, when one thinks about it, is it difficult to comprehend the point. Allowing the government to do that would mean that were a state to take so much as a farthing of federal money, it would put at risk the very sovereignty that is the basis of the Great Compromise of the summer of 1787. It\u0092s another example of how the federalist principle is a shelter of local liberty in our vast country.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "The Shelter of Federalism", "og": {"url": "http://www.nysun.com/editorials/the-shelter-of-federalism/89586/"}, "description": "President Obama seems to be hanging back from an outright threat to cut off federal funding for states that fail to bow to the government edict in respect of transgender pupils and school bathrooms.
