Smith and Timofey Mozgov - and the team\u2019s supporting cast of bench players have had a huge impact on the Cavaliers\u2019 season and are off to a strong start in the playoffs.\n\nWhile LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love did their usual damage, combining for 69 points in Sunday\u2019s 113-100 win over the Boston Celtics, it was Cleveland\u2019s backups who came through in Game 1.\n\nJames Jones made two huge shots in the third quarter to stop Boston\u2019s comeback; Tristan Thompson scored 12 points and crashed the boards; Iman Shumpert played his usual stifling defense; Matthew Dellavedova brought energy; Shawn Marion made the most of his 56 seconds and Kendrick Perkins gave an impassioned pregame speech to his new teammates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what we need. Those guys did a heckuva job,\u201d James said Monday as the Cavs prepared for Game 2 in the best-of-7 series on Tuesday night.\n\nCleveland\u2019s \u201cLittle 9\u201d have been doing it all season, helping the Cavs overcome a sluggish start to finish with the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference. But doing it during the regular season is totally different than in the playoffs when every possession is magnified. The Cavs showcased the depth they\u2019ll need in order to win a championship.\n\nAnd just as James, Irving and Love had to make personal sacrifices, Cleveland\u2019s second-stringers have forgone individual accolades for team success.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a company. You have your janitor, your CEO. You have your secretaries,\u201d said Thompson, who said his job is to bring energy as a reserve. \u201cI don\u2019t mind being the cleanup guy, punching the clock. I\u2019ll do all the little things.\u201d\n\nJones came up big in Game 1.\n\nAfter the Celtics scored 14 consecutive points to trim Cleveland\u2019s lead to six, Jones, forced to play more than usual because J.R. Smith was in foul trouble, hit a back-down, turnaround jumper - just his 12th two-point basket of the season - and then drained a 3-pointer at the horn to give the Cavaliers a 15-point lead.\n\nOnce his long-range jumper splashed through the hoop, Jones, who won two titles while getting little playing time with James in Miami, raised his arms and soaked in the screams and applause of 20,000 fans.\n\nJames said Jones has been waiting for the playoffs.\n\n\u201cI know what he\u2019s capable of doing,\u201d James said. \u201cFor him to have a moment like that last night, I was extremely happy for him.\u201d\n\nJones understands the Cavs will only go as far as the \u201cBig 3\u201d take them. But the trades that brought Smith, Shumpert and Mozgov made Cleveland a more complete team.\n\n\u201cThey added another dynamic: youth, speed, athleticism, shooting, all the things we needed to interject into this mix,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey are a very big reason for why we\u2019ve been playing well.\u201d\n\nJames laughed when asked if he taught Jones the post-up move that led to his clutch basket.\n\n\u201cNo, man,\u201d James said with a laugh. \u201cJ.J was actually a post-up player in college. He said he got to Indiana and Rick Carlisle told him, \u2018If you want to be on the floor, you need to go over there and shoot with Reggie (Miller).\u2019 So that\u2019s when he became a shooter.\u201d\n\nThompson has gladly accepted his reserve role, and he finished fifth in voting for the NBA\u2019s Sixth Man Award. Thompson doesn\u2019t need the glory. He\u2019s more than happy to roll up his sleeves and do whatever\u2019s necessary.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be a janitor forever,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Everyone has their place in the factory. I don\u2019t mind doing the little things. That\u2019s what it takes to win and be great.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "For all their talent and celebrity, the Cavaliers' \"Big 3\" can't win an NBA title by themselves.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "For all their talent and celebrity, the Cavaliers\u2019 \u201cBig 3\u201d can\u2019t win an NBA title by themselves.", "title": "Little 9: Cavaliers bench players boosting team\u2019s \u201cBig 3\u201d", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/20/little-9-cavaliers-bench-players-boosting-teams-bi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/20/b840309fb7b03911740f6a7067002dd7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/20/b840309fb7b03911740f6a7067002dd7.jpg", "description": "For all their talent and celebrity, the Cavaliers' \"Big 3\" can't win an NBA title by themselves.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Little 9: Cavaliers bench players boosting team\u2019s \u201cBig 3"}, "Author": "TOM WITHERS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd299c\"", "article_summary": "Cleveland\u2019s \u201cLittle 9\u201d have been doing it all season, helping the Cavs overcome a sluggish start to finish with the No.\nINDEPENDENCE, Ohio (AP) - For all their talent and celebrity, the Cavaliers\u2019 \u201cBig 3\u201d can\u2019t win an NBA title by themselves.\n\u201cI know what he\u2019s capable of doing,\u201d James said.\nI\u2019ll do all the little things.\u201dJones came up big in Game 1.\nBut doing it during the regular season is totally different than in the playoffs when every possession is magnified."}
