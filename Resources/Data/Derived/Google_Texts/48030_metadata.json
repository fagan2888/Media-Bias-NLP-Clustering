The LMH officials said the three private insurance companies that operate the KanCare system routinely deny legitimate claims to hold down costs. LMH also claims that the companies don\u2019t meet deadlines and often deny they have given authorization for treatment when hospital records indicate that authorization was received.\n\nThat triggers a costly and time-consuming appeals process that LMH says it has had to hire additional staff to handle \u2014 with lackluster results. LMH officials say only about 35 percent of the appeals result in claims being paid, compared to a success rate of about 90 percent with Medicare appeals.\n\nPredictably, officials of the three insurance companies \u2014 UnitedHealthcare, Sunflower Health Plan and Amerigroup \u2014 disputed the LMH claims. Although it\u2019s hard to see why LMH officials would lie about or misrepresent this situation, maybe there is some honest miscommunication or misunderstanding that could be corrected. Right now, there appears to be a standoff on a reimbursement issue that could have a serious impact on LMH and an even greater impact on smaller hospitals that can\u2019t afford to hire enough staff to pursue payment appeals.\n\nOne thing that might help is for the state to finally hire an inspector general for the KanCare program. This position, which was created to serve as a watchdog over the private Medicaid system, has been vacant for nearly two years. The inspector general is supposed to investigate fraud, waste and misconduct in the Medicaid system, and, for the last two years, no one has been doing that job. Is it any wonder that complaints are surfacing?\n\nSusan Mosier, secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, told lawmakers last week that the agency hadn\u2019t been able to hire a qualified inspector general. The salary has been raised, she said, but still no luck. This is a totally unacceptable situation. The state put private, for-profit insurance companies in control of its Medicaid system and then failed to provide the required oversight to make sure those companies were operating in an efficient and ethical manner. Maybe there are no significant problems, but without an inspector general on the job, it\u2019s pretty hard to tell.\n\nSo far, the governor and legislative leaders have been unwilling to consider accepting federal funds to expand Medicaid in Kansas. That already is placing a hardship on both Kansas hospitals and individuals in need of care. The least state officials can do is make sure the private Medicaid system they already have put in place isn\u2019t making those problems even worse.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Lawrence Journal-World.
