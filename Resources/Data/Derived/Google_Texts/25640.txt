BRUSSELS - Delhaize America on Thursday reported revenues of $17.8 billion for 2015, an increase of 2.2% compared to 2014 in local currency excluding a 53rd trading week in 2014.

Comparable store sales growth in 2015 was 2.2%.

"This year, we will further expand our Easy, Fresh & Affordable initiative at Food Lion and we plan to remodel 142 stores," noted Frans Muller, Delhaize Group CEO. “For 2016, our main focus is to complete the merger with Royal Ahold on schedule. We are confident on the prospects of the merger given the complementarity of our store networks, the opportunity to accelerate innovation for our customers and the [approximate $550 million] run-rate synergy potential," he said. "The next step in the merger process will be the Extraordinary General Meetings of both companies scheduled on March 14.”
