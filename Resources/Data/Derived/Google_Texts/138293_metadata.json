Exolune, CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nWhen it comes to getting some shut eye, people living in different parts of the world have very different bedtime rituals, from how clean the keep the bedroom to the amount of hours of sleep they clock in every night. The Global Sleep Survey, an international poll released by the NSF, compared the bedroom habits of 1,500 people between the ages of 25 and 55 years old living across the United States, Canada, Mexico, United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan.\n\nBedtime Rituals Before Sleep Across the Globe\n\nIn preparation for a good night\u2019s sleep, people living in different parts of the world have different specific bedtime rituals. For example, more than half (62 percent) of survey respondents in Mexico, and approximately half of Americans, reported to either praying or meditating an hour before going to bed, more so than other countries in the survey.\n\nAcross the pond, the British prefer to unwind with a warm tea beverage before they go to bed. And, one-third of Brits confessed to going all bare when it came to hitting the covers at night.\n\nWhich Countries Keep Their Bedrooms Cleanest?\n\nAccording to Psychology Today, a cleaner bedroom could lead to a better night\u2019s sleep. A proper sleep environment is all-inclusive \u2014 making your bed every day, keeping clean bed sheets, making sure the bedroom is dark and cool bedrooms, and using a comfortable mattresses and pillows are all essential for quality sleep. A few countries in the survey fell short of creating a proper sleep environment for a good night\u2019s rest.\n\nJapan was found to have the highest percentage of people saying they rarely or ever make the bed at 20 percent. Also, approximately a third of people in Japan admitted to changing their bed sheets less often than every three weeks. Germany closely followed by 12 percent.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, Mexico ranked the highest with 82 percent of people reporting to make their bed every single day. In addition, the country ranked highest with nearly 25 percent of people claiming they change their sheets more than once a week.\n\nNine out of 10 survey respondents from Mexico, Germany, and the U.K. confessed to feeling more at ease if they had a pleasant-smelling bedroom. Seventy-five percent of Americans and Canadians also agreed with their international counterparts.\n\nIn Germany, the smell of a bedroom is a very important element of a good night\u2019s sleep compared to other countries. German survey respondents all admitted to airing out their bedroom either weekly or more than once a week.\n\nHours of Sleep Clocked In By Country\n\nAccording to the National Sleep Foundation (NSF), while there is \u201cno magic number\u201d for sleep, the recommended amount of sleep for healthy adults is seven to eight hours of sleep every night. This amount is based on a personal\u2019s \"basal sleep need\" \u2014 the amount of sleep needed for the body to function for optimal performance \u2014 and \"sleep debt,\" sleep that that is lost due to poor sleep habits due to external factors.\n\nBut it's culuraly relative: the different societal demands in countries around the world may impact the amount of sleep a person gets. A common finding in the international poll revealed all six countries slept an average of 45 minutes more on days they do not go into work.\n\nThe most sleep deprived countries are Japan and America, both of which report an estimated 30 to 40 minutes of sleep less on workdays than the other four countries surveyed. The average amount of sleep in these two nations is about six and a half hours of sleep. On the other hand, 40 percent of Brits, 36 percent of Germans, and 30 percent of Canadians and Mexicans report getting less than seven hours of sleep on work nights.\n\nFor tips on how to effectively get to sleep faster and feel more rested, click here.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "global sleep survey, sleep, united states, canada, mexico, united kingdom, germany, japan", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Global Sleep Survey lifts the covers on the bedtime routines, bedroom cleanliness, and the amount of sleep in six countries.", "title": "What Country Meditates, Sleeps Naked, And Changes Their Bed Sheets The Least?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/global-sleep-survey-who-meditates-sleeps-naked-and-changes-their-bed-sheets-least-256317", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/woman-sleeping-bed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Global Sleep Survey lifts the covers on the bedtime routines, bedroom cleanliness, and the amount of sleep in six countries.", "title": "What Country Meditates, Sleeps Naked, And Changes Their Bed Sheets The Least?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/global-sleep-survey-who-meditates-sleeps-naked-and-changes-their-bed-sheets-least-256317", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/woman-sleeping-bed.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/10/woman-sleeping-bed.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-10T17:55:50-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-25T11:43:01-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Global Sleep Survey lifts the covers on the bedtime routines, bedroom cleanliness, and the amount of sleep in six countries."}, "article_summary": "The Global Sleep Survey lifts the covers on the bedtime routines, bedroom cleanliness, and the amount of sleep in six countries.\nBedtime Rituals Before Sleep Across the GlobeIn preparation for a good night\u2019s sleep, people living in different parts of the world have different specific bedtime rituals.\nAlso, approximately a third of people in Japan admitted to changing their bed sheets less often than every three weeks.\nAccording to Psychology Today, a cleaner bedroom could lead to a better night\u2019s sleep.\nIn Germany, the smell of a bedroom is a very important element of a good night\u2019s sleep compared to other countries."}
