U.S. President Barack Obama's sweeping healthcare overhaul on Monday went before the U.S. Supreme Court where the nine justices began hearing arguments in a historic test of the law's validity under the U.S. Constitution. REUTERS/Jason Reed (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS HEALTH CIVIL UNREST) - RTR2ZWK8\n\n4194499\n\nEmergency room visits have risen since Obamacare went into effect and more ER physicians expect it to hurt than help.\n\nAccording to a nationwide poll of emergency department doctors from the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), 40 percent of ER physicians think Obamacare will have a negative impact on quality and patient safety; just 20 percent think the health care law will improve it.\n\nEven when it comes to access to emergency care \u2014 where almost half of ER doctors have seen more patients since the health care law went live \u2014 just 34 percent think Obamacare is improving access. Twenty-nine percent think Obamacare will lower access.\n\nIn another telling result, 29 percent think Obamacare will lower disaster preparedness, while a measly 6 percent expect it to help. Emergency departments are charged with responding to almost any crisis, from tornadoes to hurricanes to traffic accidents. It\u2019s possible that emergency services will be siphoned off by newly insured Medicaid patients, who have notoriously low access to primary care doctors due low physician reimbursement rates. (RELATED: Less than half of doctors in nation\u2019s largest cities are accepting Medicaid)\n\n\u201cEmergency visits will increase in large part because more people will have health insurance and therefore will be seeking medical care,\u201d said ACEP president Alex Rosenau. \u201cBut America has severe primary care shortages, and many physicians do not accept Medicaid patients, because Medicaid pays so low. When people can\u2019t get appointments with physicians, they will seek care in emergency departments.\u201d\n\nAlmost half of emergency physicians reported an increased volume of ER patients since Obamacare coverage began. Thirty-seven percent of respondents said ER volumes had increased slightly, while another 9 percent said they\u2019d increased greatly. Another 27 percent reported that their overall volume had stayed the same. A whopping 86 percent of the ER docs expect emergency room visits to grow over the next three years \u2014 and of that 41 percent think they\u2019ll increase greatly.\n\nACEP is worried that Medicaid patients are a primary driver of the increased volume. Thirty-one percent of respondents reported that the volume of Medicaid patients had grown since Obamacare coverage was enacted; of that, 7 percent said Medicaid emergency patients had grown greatly. Another 31 percent said the volume had remained the same, and 36 percent weren\u2019t sure.\n\nMedicaid has long been known to increase emergency department visits for non-emergent reasons. A January Harvard-MIT study found that after Oregon expanded Medicaid, those who received the coverage visited the ER 40 percent more than those without insurance \u2014 with no increase in health outcomes. (RELATED: Harvard study: Medicaid actually increases ER visits)\n\nBut while ER\u2019s are filling up, emergency departments aren\u2019t prepared for the influx. Seventy-seven percent aren\u2019t ready for the boost in volume. Just 10 percent say they\u2019re adequately prepared for the growth.\n\nWhile they\u2019re being faced with increased volumes of non-emergency patients and departments that may not be able to handle the growth while maintaining essential patient safety and disaster services, a majority of ER doctors simultaneously think they\u2019re in for a pay cut courtesy of Obamacare.\n\nFifty-one percent of emergency doctors said they expect payment for emergency visits to be reduced as a result of the Affordable Care Act. Another 19 percent expect reimbursement to remain the same, but just 13 percent think their pay will be upped.\n\n\u201cACEP is urging Congress to make a firm commitment to emergency patients by holding a hearing to examine whether additional strains are occurring in the emergency department safety net as a consequence of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Dr. Rosenau concluded.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
