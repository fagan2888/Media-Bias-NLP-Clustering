Dylann Roof in Charleston is white. Elliott Rodgers at UC-Santa Barbara was of mixed English-Chinese origins. Major Nidal Malik Hasan of Fort Hood is of Palestinian descent. Aaron Alexis, who killed at the Washington Navy Yard, was black. Their belief systems are distinctive too, sometimes right, sometimes left, sometimes religious, sometimes secular. Some are deeply mentally ill, but many more are not. And so on backward through the list of these distinctively American slaughters. Despite their differences, however, these mass killers shared one quality with each other and with every other American besides: easy access to deadly weapons. Gun massacres are regularly followed by another uniquely American ritual: a cacophony of voices exonerating American gun laws for American gun violence. \u201cWhat type of gun law would have made this situation not occur?\u201d objected South Carolina\u2019s junior senator, Tim Scott, on Fox News. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry dismissed the \u201cknee-jerk reaction\u201d that \u201cif we can just take the guns out of the hands of everyone in this country, these types of things won't happen again.\u201d Gun advocates boldly insist that gun massacres occur because Americans are not yet heavily armed enough. In the end, the political system shrugs its collective shoulders: The fact that Americans are regularly gunned down in large numbers by lone gunmen\u2014and that Britons, Germans, French, Italians, Canadians, Japanese, Australians, New Zealanders, South Koreans, Danes, Swiss, Poles, and Spaniards are not\u2014is just one of those unfathomable mysteries, like the fate of the crew of the Mary Celeste.\n\nThere is of course no \u201cone law\u201d that would prevent all gun massacres, any more than there is \u201cone law\u201d that would eliminate all house fires, all fatal car crashes, or all smoking deaths. Yet American society has made amazing progress at enhancing citizen safety against fires, car crashes, and smoking. Related Story Mass Murderers From Becoming Famous It\u2019s true that \u201cno one thing\u201d did it. It would have been utterly false to predict \u201cnothing\u201d could do it. So with guns. The good news is that the larger decline in the crime rate has reduced Americans\u2019 odds of being murdered in any way, including by gun. Yet even as crime rates decline, not only in the U.S. but in all developed countries, the United States continues to suffer mass casualty gun massacres with a frequency seen nowhere else in the developed world: 133 between 2000 and 2014, as compared to 3 in Canada, 2 in Australia, and 1 in the United Kingdom, according to one global survey. As guns proliferate (perhaps 270 million of them in the United States comparted to just 9.5 million in Canada)\u2014and as handguns displace hunting pieces\u2014so do gun accidents and suicides. The right of gun ownership is cherished by many Americans. Yet there are incremental steps, building on existing law, that could keep guns out of wrong hands and enhance public safety. Enforce Laws Against Prohibited Gun Buyers Under current federal law, it is illegal for many categories of people to own firearms. Among those prohibited owners are: Anyone who has been convicted of a felony whose full civil rights have not been restored;\n\nAnyone who is a fugitive from justice;\n\nAnyone who is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance\n\nAnyone who has ever been adjudicated as mentally noncompetent or involuntarily admitted to a mental institution\n\nAny alien illegally present in the United States\n\nAny alien admitted under a non-immigration visa\n\nAnyone who has been dishonorably discharged from the armed forces;\n\nAnyone under a restraining order for harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner;\n\nAnyone convicted of domestic violence, including misdemeanors. But while it\u2019s illegal for people in those categories to own firearms, the complementary duty imposed on others not to sell firearms to prohibited persons is weak and easily evaded. Federally registered firearms vendors are required to enter the prospective purchasers\u2019 names into a federal database. If the names are not found, the vendor is clear, without any independent obligation to verify further. Guns sold at gun shows or in other private sales are not subject even to the background check rule in most states.\n\nA convicted felon clutching a syringe and ranting about his dishonorable discharge can enter a gun dealer\u2019s premises and\u2014so long as his name does not appear in a database\u2014the seller remains legally immune no matter how much objective warning he had that his customer was a prohibited possessor. Under the 2005 federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act and similar state laws, vendors can generally be held liable for a sale only if they can be shown to have had affirmative knowledge that the gun buyer intended to use the weapon to commit a crime. Contrast this to the laws that apply to people selling liquor. Liquor sellers have an independent legal duty not to serve intoxicated people. Liquor sellers can be sued by injured third parties if they fail in that duty. Most gun dealers wish to sell to lawful owners. Most\u2014but not all. In 1995, a researcher analyzed government tracing data and discovered that 1 percent of gun dealers sold 57 percent of the weapons found at crime scenes. By holding these rogue gun dealers to account, it might be possible to significantly diminish the flow of guns into criminal hands. Instead, Congress chose to protect rogue gun dealers from scrutiny and sanction. In 2003, Congress passed a law forbidding government agencies to disclose tracing data that might link a particular dealer to a criminal purchaser. It\u2019s hard to hold gun dealers responsible for selling to unlawful buyers if nobody is allowed to know where an unlawful buyer purchased his weapons. Require Gun Owners to Carry Liability Insurance Guns are dangerous products. There are some 15,000 accidental shootings per year in the United States, leading to 600 accidental deaths. Buy a car, and state law requires that it be insured. Dig a swimming pool, and expect to pay hundreds of dollars a year more in homeowners\u2019 insurance, which anybody who carries a mortgage will likewise be required to carry. Guns need not be insured, however, neither in law nor in practice. The uninsured status of guns means that people injured by them face great difficulty recovering the costs of their medical treatment and other economic losses. Injured persons can sue a negligent gun owner and try to recover from his home insurance, if he owns a home. Most of the time, however, gunshot victims will be left to bear their economic losses on their own.\n\nA requirement that gun owners carry insurance would not only protect potential accident victims\u2014including gun owners, since many gun accidents are self-inflicted\u2014against economic loss. An insurance requirement would create incentives for more responsible gun behavior. Just as insurance companies offer better rates to those who install burglar alarms, so they might offer better rates to those who install secure gun safes. Just as a prior accident raises the future cost of car insurance, so careless gun owners will be encouraged to exercise better care in future. Require Meaningful Training for Carry-Permit Holders After a slaughter like that in Charlestown, gun advocates argue that it occurred because Americans still don\u2019t carry enough guns. If only \u201ca good guy with a gun\u201d had been in the vicinity, the killer could have been stopped! The implicit premise of this claim is that gun owners who carry weapons in public will use them responsibly, effectively, and accurately\u2014that the \u201cgood guy with a gun\u201d will actually bring down the bad guy, and not half a dozen innocent victims who happen to be within a twenty-foot radius. Are these assumptions reasonable? Curtis Reeves, the retired police officer who gunned down a young father for texting during movie previews, was a concealed-carry permit holder. George Zimmerman thought he was a \u201cgood guy with a gun\u201d when he tracked and killed Trayvon Martin. Certified florists in the State of Florida are required to take six weeks of courses at a cost of at least $600. They must pass a series of exams, and purchase a business license from the state. You might think that the power to deal death to strangers in public would be more closely supervised than the right to sell floral arrangements. You would be wrong. To obtain a concealed-carry permit, a Floridian must only submit a \u201ccertificate of competency\u201d from a firearms instructor\u2014and in Florida, literally anybody can represent himself as a firearms instructor and issue competency certificates. The state does not even know how many self-designated instructors are doing business in Florida, but they number in the thousands. The Sarasota Herald Tribune reports: Managers at the Florida Division of Licensing, the state agency charged with issuing concealed-carry licenses, acknowledge that they have no authority to regulate how someone is trained, much less police the trainers themselves. The extent of their power is to deny the license application. It\u2019s suspected, too, that some Florida gun trainers will sell a certificate of competency without the bother of any instruction at all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No single law could have stopped the tragedy in Charleston, but incremental steps can reduce the risk of future attacks.", "author": "David Frum", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "No single law could have prevented the tragedy in Charleston, but incremental steps can reduce the risk of future attacks.", "title": "Mass Shootings Are Preventable", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/06/RTR3RNRY/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/06/mass-shootings-are-preventable/396644/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1d9\"", "article_summary": "Gun massacres are regularly followed by another uniquely American ritual: a cacophony of voices exonerating American gun laws for American gun violence.\nA requirement that gun owners carry insurance would not only protect potential accident victims\u2014including gun owners, since many gun accidents are self-inflicted\u2014against economic loss.\n\u201cWhat type of gun law would have made this situation not occur?\u201d objected South Carolina\u2019s junior senator, Tim Scott, on Fox News.\nIt\u2019s hard to hold gun dealers responsible for selling to unlawful buyers if nobody is allowed to know where an unlawful buyer purchased his weapons.\nRequire Gun Owners to Carry Liability Insurance Guns are dangerous products."}
