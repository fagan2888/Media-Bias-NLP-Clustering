I worked with Nic on several research projects that required his computer skills, and we cooperated on community volunteer efforts.\n\nNic contracted the hepatitis C virus, or HCV. As a self-employed computer consultant, he did not have insurance coverage and was too young to qualify for Medicare.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was implemented in 2011, and the Texas Legislature failed to expand Medicaid after a misguided U.S. Supreme Court ruling that states need not accept federally funded insurance coverage for low-income people.\n\nNic fell into the coverage gap \u2014 those 766,000 Texans who don\u2019t qualify for ACA subsidies and also don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid, and are thus left uninsured. In 31 other states, he would have been fully insured.\n\nNevertheless, Nic\u2019s hopes were raised after December 2013 when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a drug called Sovaldi, which Gilead Sciences advertised as \u201cproviding high cure rates\u201d (greater than 90 percent) for patients with HCV.\n\nThe Houston Chronicle reported that the drug costs about $1,000 a day, or $84,000 for a 12-week treatment.\n\nThe Gilead website offers a \u201cco-pay coupon\u201d to U.S. patients \u201cwho are not enrolled in a government health care prescription program\u201d such as Medicare Part D or Medicaid. The coupon would reduce the cost of Sovaldi by 25 percent of the catalog price. Cash-pay patients like Nic or those with commercial insurance would thus be paying $750 per pill. For a 90-day course of treatment, he would need to raise about $67,500.\n\nAstronomical drug costs are becoming all too common in this country as drug companies use political donations to control health policies. The Center for Responsive Politics reports that the pharmaceuticals and health products industry spent more on lobbying Congress than any other industry \u2014 a total of $3.146 billion from 1998 to 2015.\n\nThe drug lobby was able to block a provision in the Affordable Care Act of 2010 that would have allowed Medicare to negotiate down drug prices. Now Medicare pays the drug companies whatever they ask, and that comes out of everyone\u2019s taxes.\n\nRecent news reports demonstrate that hiking drug prices has become standard practice among most pharmaceutical companies to the point where drugs are not affordable for many patients.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about HCV drugs. More than 100 oncologists in the August Mayo Clinic Proceedings reported that \u201cthe high prices of cancer drugs are affecting the care of patients with cancer and our health care system.\u201d They called for a popular uprising among American cancer patients to form \u201ca grassroots movement that advocates against the high price of cancer drugs.\u201d\n\nAt their state convention in Fort Worth in June, several Green Party members noted Nic\u2019s absence and were told of his condition. Immediately, a fundraising effort was launched to pay his plane fare to India to buy the medication he needed.\n\nMy repeated calls to the drug manufacturer identified too late a little-known patient assistance program that might have allowed people like Nic, those with no insurance who met certain income guidelines, to apply to obtain the drug for free. A close friend is sure that Nic was unaware of the program.\n\nTime, his health and money ran out for Nic. He died Sept. 18 without obtaining the $1,000 pills or making it to India, where the Bloomberg News Service reported that the same pill costs about $10.\n\nHe was 62.\n\nRobert Brischetto is the former executive director of the Southwest Voter Research Institute.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "The Affordable Care Act was implemented in 2011, and the Texas Legislature failed to expand Medicaid after a misguided U.S. Supreme Court ruling that states need not accept federally funded insurance coverage for low-income people.
