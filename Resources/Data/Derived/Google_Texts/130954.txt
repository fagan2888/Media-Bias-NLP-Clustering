The nation's first legal recreational pot shops opened doors to long lines in Colorado on Wednesday, January 1, 2014. And one Louisiana representative is taking note, according to FOX 8.

Last legislative session, state representative Austin Badon (D-New Orleans), proposed a law to significantly reduce penalties and incarceration time for those convicted more than once of possessing natural or synthetic cannabis products, and remove possession of these products from mandatory minimum sentences under the state's habitual offender, or "three strikes" law.

Badon will propose a similar bill in the upcoming legislative session, convening March 10.

When NOLA.com readers were originally polled on Badon's marijuana bill last March, 78% liked it (1,900+ readers). In light of Colorado's legalization of weed, do you think Badon's marijuana bill will garner enough support to get passed in the 2014 Louisiana legislative session?
