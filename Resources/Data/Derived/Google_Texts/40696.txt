Members of Congress head to their home districts for a 10-day work period having failed this week to pass an extension of federal unemployment benefits.

Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, says it is critical that members of the House and Senate address this crisis. Owens says the recent decline in the unemployment rate is largely the result of workers dropping out of the labor force.

NELP notes the average duration of unemployment exceeds 37 weeks, and that 38 percent of those who are jobless have been out of work for six months or more.

Owens appears this weekend on NC Policy Watchâ€™s radio show News and Views. For a preview of her interview with Chris Fitzsimon, click below.

Congress returns to work January 27th.
