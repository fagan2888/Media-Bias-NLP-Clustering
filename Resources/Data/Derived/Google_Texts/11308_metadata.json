Karen Peterson (D-Stanton) said a recent national report she read showed a low average of seven percent of Medicaid cases are fraudulent or wasteful.\n\nAs an example, she said, \u201cThat would put our waste fraud and abuse in Delaware at $47 million.\u201d\n\nMedicaid fraud and abuse is a national problem with some states reporting that as many as 12-percent of all cases are fraudulent.\n\nPeterson added that Delaware has a \u201cpay and chase\u201d approach, where it pays claims first and follows up on fraudulent or wasteful spending later.\n\nGroff said they do not have exact data on exactly how many cases in Delaware are fraudulent.\n\n\u201cI would hope or like to think that there are some things about Delaware, that our rates would be a little bit lower,\u201d said Groff. \u201cThings we have, like the prescription drug monitoring program now and we have very aggressive benefit limits on our prescription drug program.\u201d\n\nHe said the state uses the Surveillance and Utilization Review Unit to look at claims data and target providers or individuals that could be abusing the system.\n\n\u201cWhen we find instances that have creditable activity, they\u2019re referred to the attorney general's office and the Medicaid control fraud unit,\u201d he said.\n\nPeterson noted that the AG\u2019s office has recovered less than $2 million in Medicaid fraud cases.\n\nShe said she\u2019d like to see more done \u201con the front end\u201d rather than chasing down claims later on.\n\nOne suggestion is implementing Medicaid cards, which would feature a chip full of the patient\u2019s medical data.\n\nThe card would keep track of tests and procedures that the patient has already had done to prevent duplication which can become costly.\n\nGroff said they\u2019ve looked into that kind of solution however he said they have some concerns about patients carrying around that kind of information due to HIPAA and other laws.\n\nHe said they\u2019re also continuing to implement the statewide health information exchange.\n\nDHSS will continue their budget requests in Dover on Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Delaware Department of Health and Social Services presented the Division of Medicaid and Medical Assistance budget request in Dover where they asked for an additional $25 6 million to fund", "title": "As Medicaid costs grow, Delaware lawmakers propose crackdown on fraud and waste", "og": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/nw_logo_fb.png", "site_name": "Newsworks.org", "description": "The Delaware Department of Health and Social Services presented the Division of Medicaid and Medical Assistance budget request in Dover where they asked for an additional $25.6 million to fund..."}, "twitter": {"description": "The Delaware Department of Health and Social Services presented the Division of Medicaid and Medical Assistance budget request in Dover where they asked for an additional $25.6 million to fund...", "title": "As Medicaid costs grow, Delaware lawmakers propose crackdown on fraud and waste", "image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_l_leg-hall-1200-2-3.jpg", "creator": "@shanaomalley", "site": "@NewsWorksWHYY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffc40d", "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2014-02-27", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"page_id": 115829381793481}, "url": "http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/delaware/65335-as-medicaid-costs-grow-delaware-lawmakers-propose-crackdown-on-fraud-and-waste-", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "author": "Shana O'Malley", "keywords": "medicaid, delaware, &nbsp, fraud, would, cases, fraudulent, groff, claims, million, they\u2019re, budget, peterson, medical, division, continue, later, prescription, national, which", "google-site-verification": "zlKVThgI_7CsCilHyAeJraRojXxR5nL5CZqBEZJMJNw", "st": {"image": "http://www.newsworks.org/images/stories/flexicontent/m_l_leg-hall-1200-2-3.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8558\"", "article_summary": "Peterson noted that the AG\u2019s office has recovered less than $2 million in Medicaid fraud cases.\nAs Medicaid costs continue to rise, Delaware lawmakers want to see a more done to combat and recover funds that are mixed up in waste and fraud.\nSen.
