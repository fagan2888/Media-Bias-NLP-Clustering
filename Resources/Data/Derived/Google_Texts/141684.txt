As a retired member of the Boulder County Housing Authority Development Department, I am very much aware of the desperate need for affordable housing in Boulder County. For over 12 years I was involved with revitalizing and developing affordable housing in Boulder County and have seen how vital quality affordable housing is to many more of our residents that people realize.

However, it is just as important to look at why people want to live here and to preserve and develop that value as well. Regarding the Twin Lakes area, I do not feel that it is an appropriate location for any development, affordable or not.

We create these welcoming places within our communities for wildlife to exist among us and we must preserve those spaces even if unofficially. To welcome wildlife only to then take away that welcome via development is inappropriate. While I fully support the development of affordable housing, especially as well as it is being done in Boulder County, Twin Lakes is not the right location for the next development.

My opinion is not based on a NIMBY (not in my back yard) approach as I live in Longmont, far from the Twin Lakes area, but is based on rational consideration of the rights of nature. I firmly believe we must always consider the rights of nature in all our decisions regarding development. I am 100 percent opposed to any development in the Twin Lakes area as proposed and would like to see full consideration of the rights of nature in any and all decisions made by the planning department, the housing authority, and the county commissioners.
