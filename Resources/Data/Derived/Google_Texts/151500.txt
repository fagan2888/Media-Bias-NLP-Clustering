Sioux Falls, SD

The nursing industry is expecting to grow faster than any other through 2022 and Augustana College is ready to train the workforce.

With Sanford, Avera and the VA Hospital in town, Chair of the Nursing Department Pam Schroeder says Sioux Falls is a great place to get experience.

"So our nursing students are right here on the forefront of all the latest happenings in health care," Chair of Nursing Pam Schroeder said.

Today Augie students are getting hands-on training through a simulation.

Because nurses are in such high demand, many students at Augie have positions lined up before they graduate. That list includes senior Megan Kalda.

"We're graduating at the end of the month and almost all of us have jobs," Kalda said. "I will be working at Sanford. I'm excited about that."

The nursing program is growing with the field. A new $35 million renovation of the Gilbert Science Center will be complete in 2016.

"This is a new beginning for Augustana. We're so excited," Schroeder said.

It will change the way Augie teaches nursing students for the better.

If there is one downside, WalletHub says South Dakota ranks 46th for annual average salary for nurses. It's not something Kalda is worried about.

"It's not all about pay. I mean that definitely is a huge part of it because you have to make a living. Nursing is more than pay. It's about the job. It's about what you're doing. I'm ok with that," Kalda said.

South Dakota ranks third for educational opportunities and fourth for number of health care facilities per capita. Augustana is currently seeing 100 percent placement for nursing students.
