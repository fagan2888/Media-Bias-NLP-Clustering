Lebanon, received a notice Tuesday informing him that the premium for the Freedom Blue PPO plan he and his wife buy will rise 25 percent next year to $733 a month, from $587 a month.\n\n\u201cI was shocked,\u201d Stull said. \u201cI'm thinking that I'm going to have to switch.\u201d\n\nStull has several options to choose from, he said. But he will have to pick carefully to ensure an infusion treatment he receives at St. Clair Hospital for Crohn's disease is covered by another health plan.\n\nPremiums for Security Blue ValueRx, an HMO plan that's one of the Medicare Advantage offerings are more than doubling, from $20 a month to $52 a month, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Medicare Advantage is government-funded coverage for seniors that's offered through private insurers.\n\nArt Walker, a 78-year-old from Baldwin, also is planning to drop his Freedom Blue coverage because of Highmark's rate hike. But he's worried about whether a different plan will provide coverage in Florida, where he and his wife live for several months during the winter.\n\n\u201cI don't want my options limited at my age,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI don't want to be limited where I can go for my doctors.\u201d\n\nHighmark spokesman Aaron Billger said the insurer is raising premiums on all its Freedom Blue and Security Blue plans, which have 339,000 members in Pennsylvania. About two-thirds of those members are in Freedom Blue.\n\n\u201cThe biggest driver is reduced government funding as a result of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Billger said.\n\nThe insurer lost some funding for Freedom Blue because the plan's quality rating was cut by the Medicare program last year, to 3 1\u2044 2 stars from 4 stars.\n\n\u201cReimbursements are linked to star rating,\u201d said Billger, who noted that Freedom Blue's rating for 2015 was raised back to 4 stars. Security Blue is rated 4 stars.\n\nInsurers complain about losing Medicare Advantage funding, but they don't mention that the government pays them an average 14 percent more than traditional Medicare, said David Lipschutz, senior policy attorney for the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit in New York.\n\n\u201cOne of the factors that plays into the changes in annual benefits is efforts under the Affordable Care Act to rein in overpayments to Medicare Advantage plans,\u201d Lipschutz said. \u201cThey are paid at much higher rates than traditional Medicare.\u201d\n\nOver the past several years, Highmark has faced increasing competition for seniors from UPMC Health Plan and others, and its market share in Western Pennsylvania dropped from 61.1 percent in 2010 to 48.6 percent this year, according to federal data.\n\nUPMC Health Plan, meanwhile, is cutting premium prices of four of its six Medicare Advantage plans, which it markets under the name UPMC for Life.\n\nThe second-largest health insurer in Western Pennsylvania is lowering rates between 0.4 percent and 51 percent, depending on the plan. It also is raising the premium on one plan by 11 percent. And it offers a $0 premium plan.\n\n\u201cUPMC for Life continues to grow because it has so much to offer to the Medicare beneficiaries of Western Pennsylvania,\u201d said Diane Holder, president of UPMC Health Plan.\n\nTo compensate for higher rates on its existing plans, Highmark introduced a limited-network plan for next year with a $0 premium.\n\nIn exchange for zero premium, Community Blue Medicare HMO members will have in-network access only to select community hospitals in a 23-county region of Western Pennsylvania.\n\nIn Allegheny County, for instance, seniors can access only the Allegheny Health Network hospitals, Ohio Valley General in McKees Rocks and Heritage Valley-Sewickley. All hospitals in Westmoreland and Butler counties are out-of-network.\n\nMedicare's one-month open enrollment period starts Oct. 15.\n\nAlex Nixon is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
