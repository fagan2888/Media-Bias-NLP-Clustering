Libyan Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thinni denied this.\n\n\"These individuals have been detained in relation to financing extremism and terrorism and facilitating the transfer of fighting equipment,\" a source familiar with legal proceedings in the UAE said.\n\nHe said they were being questioned and then would be charged and put on trial.\n\nHRW quoted relatives of two of the detained Libyans, brothers Mohamed and Salim Elaradi, who have lived in the UAE since the 1990s, as saying that neither man had made any contact with their families since security forces detained them on Aug. 28.\n\n\"The family members said that the authorities refuse to acknowledge that the men are in custody or divulge their whereabouts,\" it said.\n\nThe pair are brothers of Abdulrazag Elaradi, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Justice and Construction Party in Libya, but their families say they have no political affiliations, HRW said.\n\nHRW said the Libyan ambassador had confirmed the detention of the two and two other brothers, Kamal and Mohamed Kamal Eldarat.\n\nHRW said it had also contacted relatives of another three of the 10 Libyans it says have been detained in the UAE since the last week of August, all of them businessmen.\n\nDuring a visit to Abu Dhabi last month, Thinni said that the UAE had arrested seven Libyan nationals.\n\nThe six detained Emiratis were taken into custody on Sept. 22 in the town of Khor Fhakkan in the Emirate of Sharjah, HRW said, quoting a source close to one of their families. HRW said the detained Emiratis included a 17-year-old youth identified as Omar Ibrahim Mahmood.
