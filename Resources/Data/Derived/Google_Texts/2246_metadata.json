Rand Paul speaks at Matt Bevin rally in Frankfort. (Photo: Joseph Gerth/The Courier-Journal)Buy Photo\n\nFRANKFORT, Ky. \u2013 Calling it a \u201cminor thing,\u201d U.S. Sen. Rand Paul said on Saturday it doesn\u2019t matter that Matt Bevin doesn\u2019t support his presidential campaign.\n\nPaul dismissed concern about Bevin\u2019s support of Ben Carson following a rally in Frankfort in which he endorsed Bevin for governor and called on Republicans to elect the entire GOP slate next month.\n\n\u201cIn the last presidential poll in Kentucky, I was leading with 20 percent of the vote, which means that 80 percent of the vote or 80 percent of the people aren\u2019t supporting me for president,\u201d Paul said in an impromptu press conference. \u201cBut does that mean I don\u2019t think they support me as their U.S. senator or don\u2019t support me personally? No.\n\n\u201c... We all have differing opinions on who we will vote for or who we support and If you can\u2019t take that, you might as well not run for office,\u201d Paul said.\n\nBevin, who was standing next to Paul during the press conference said nothing then, but he did say during the campaign rally in the basement of the Baptist Campus Ministry building at Kentucky State University that he believes Paul would make an \u201cextraordinary president of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe Republican gubernatorial nominee raised eyebrows on Wednesday during a debate on Kentucky Sports Radio when he said that he supports South Carolina neurosurgeon Ben Carson as president because \"He's not taking shots at people. He's intelligent. He's articulate. He's respected.\"\n\nWhen asked specifically about Paul, Bevin said, \"I think the world of Rand. He's a friend of mine. He's been very gracious to me ... But in terms of who I would select right now for the next president, he would not be the first choice that I would make.\u201d\n\nAt the campaign rally Saturday in which about 55 or 60 people \u2014 excluding campaign and Senate staff, children and members of the media \u2014 attended, he tried to defuse the situation early before launching into his stump speech.\n\n\u201cWe have a choice, we can go one of two ways. Here in Kentucky, in this election, we can either do it the right way or we can do it the Conway,\u201d he said, a reference to Attorney General Jack Conway, who is the Democratic nominee for governor.\n\nHe told the crowd that passage of legislation that would allow people to work in union shops without paying union dues or representation fees, anti-abortion legislation, or legislation that would limit medical malpractice claims, depends upon his election.\n\n\u201cIf we are to shrink the size of state government, make it more efficient and streamlined \u2026 then we must win this race,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a very distinct difference between our campaign and that of our opponents.\"\n\nAlso speaking at the event were treasurer candidate Allison Ball, secretary of state candidate Steve Knipper and U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, of Lexington.\n\nFollowing the event, Paul said his campaign is not floundering and promised to stay in \u201cthrough the primaries.\u201d\n\nSome have called on Paul to drop out of the presidential race and focus on re-election to the U.S. Senate following moribund fundraising that grossed him only $2.5 million in the last quarter and stagnant poll numbers that have him mired near the cellar of Republican candidates.\n\nIn national polls released over the last week and a half, Paul gets between 1 and 3 percent in all of them.\n\nBut Paul said of those who have written they should get out and focus on his Senate re-election, \u201cWho would say such a thing? Rebuke them, rebuke them. They don\u2019t know anything about politics, they\u2019re all writing for a living.\n\n\u201cWe are doing very well. Yesterday we announced that have a chair in each of the counties in Iowa \u2026 We\u2019re the only race to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a lot of good things going on. The polls haven\u2019t all been good, I admit that.\u201d\n\nPaul added that he expects to be on stage for the upcoming CNBC debate. Currently, he will make the stage for the main event by just 0.25 percentage points, with a few polls yet to report.\n\n\"It\u2019s always important to be part of the debate, but we think we will be,\u201d he said.\n\nJoseph Gerth can be reached at (502) 582-4702 or jgerth@courier-journal.com.
