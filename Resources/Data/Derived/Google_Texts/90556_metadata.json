Boy bands have a long history of VMAs hysteria and much-hyped appearances (think \u2018N Sync and its 2013 reunion rumors). 5SOS rides the release of a hit album and an opening gig on One Direction\u2019s stadium tour into its appearance at the Forum in Inglewood, California.\n\nHere\u2019s a look back at five key moments in boy band-VMA history, in chronological order:\n\n\u2014 New New Edition: There were plenty of bands with good lookin\u2019 boys on the VMAs in the early years, but the first official boy band appearance didn\u2019t come until New Edition\u2019s epic 1990 reunion on the show. Covering six songs and more than 10 minutes, Bel Biv DeVoe (which included three of New Edition\u2019s original members), Bobby Brown, Johnny Gill and Ralph Tresvant all performed separately before coming together in a reunion performance \u2014 complete with mirrorball suit coats, bowler caps and a confusing array of hairstyles \u2014 to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the group\u2019s founding.\n\n\u2014 Bigtime Boys: Sure, looking back it\u2019s a head-scratcher, but the Backstreet Boys used to be the biggest boy band in the world. Look no further than the band\u2019s run of VMA appearances at the turn of the century. Appearing for the first time in 1998, BSB flexed its muscle-shirted muscle by taking best group video over \u2026 Radiohead? \u2026 and performed the instantly recognizable hit \u201cEverybody (Backstreet\u2019s Back).\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bring on the screams: 5 MTV VMA boy band moments", "author": "Chris Talbott", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Bring on the screams: 5 MTV VMA boy band moments", "title": "Bring on the screams: 5 MTV VMA boy band moments", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/21/bring_on_the_screams_5_mtv_vma_boy_band_moments/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/music-mtv-video-music-awards.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bring on the screams: 5 MTV VMA boy band moments", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/music-mtv-video-music-awards.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Bring on the screams: 5 MTV VMA boy band moments", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Bring on the screams: 5 MTV VMA boy band moments", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd08b5\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 Bigtime Boys: Sure, looking back it\u2019s a head-scratcher, but the Backstreet Boys used to be the biggest boy band in the world.\nThe Australian pop-punk-loving quartet of tousle-haired hunks (whose members don\u2019t consider themselves a boy band) will make its debut Sunday on MTV\u2019s over-the-top annual celebration.\nBoy bands have a long history of VMAs hysteria and much-hyped appearances (think \u2018N Sync and its 2013 reunion rumors).\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsGet ready for another potential OMG boy band moment: 5 Seconds of Summer is about to make its debut on the MTV Video Music Awards.\nLook no further than the band\u2019s run of VMA appearances at the turn of the century."}
