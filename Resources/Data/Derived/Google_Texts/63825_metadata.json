Todd Lutz, director of Managed Care Services at Topeka's Stormont-Vail HealthCare, says people who already are on the program should take time review any changes to their plan that they may have received and review their needs to see if perhaps they might want to make a change.\n\nPeople who are new to Medicare also should take time to study their options. Lutz says it is best to talk to an expert, whether that's a licensed insurance agent or a representative of the Senior Health Insurance Counseling for Kansas, or SHICK, program. The service is available through area agencies on aging.\n\nLutz says the counselors can lead you through studying whether you might want to opt for traditional medicare, whether you might benefit from a supplement, or if you could opt for a Medicare Advantage program, where a private company covers your needs. Beyond that, people will want to explore a Part D program for prescription drug coverage.\n\nLutz says people then will need to study the plans themselves to see if their doctors and hospitals and medications are covered.\n\nLutz says he has been contacted by seniors concerned they'll have trouble because of all the attention over healthcare.gov and its problems. He says they're two different systems. He says the Affordable Care Act does not impact Medicare, so people who are on Medicare need not worry about the issues.\n\nSHICK counselors for the Topeka area can be reached through the Jayhawk Area Agency on Aging at 1-800-798-1366.

People can find out information at sales seminars. They will be held at 10 am and 2 pm Nov. 8; 10 am and 2 pm Nov. 18; and 10 am Nov. 25.
