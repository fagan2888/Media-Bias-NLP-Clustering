Released after a year in a San Francisco county lockup\u2014just one in a series of drug-related sentences he\u2019d served over the years\u2014he headed right back to the streets he knew best. \u201cFour hours after I got out, I got me a 40 [ounce bottle of malt liquor] and a rock of crack,\u201d says Sanders, a wiry African American man with a scar on his forehead and a pair of spotless Nikes on his feet. \u201cThen I turned around, and there was a cop right behind me.\u201d He was back behind bars before the day was over.\n\nSlightly slower-paced versions of Sanders\u2019 story play out every day all across the country. An astonishing two-thirds of the 730,000 men and women released from America\u2019s lockups each year have either substance abuse problems, mental health problems, or both. Very often, those problems were largely responsible for getting them locked up in the first place. Most addicted and mentally ill prisoners receive little or no effective treatment while they\u2019re incarcerated or after they\u2019re turned loose, so it\u2019s little surprise that, like Sanders, they soon wind up back in jail. But for some, that revolving door may stop spinning this year, thanks to a little-noticed side-effect of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Obamacare, it turns out, might be a crime-fighting tool.\n\nNumerous studies support the common-sense notion that treating offenders\u2019 drug addictions and mental illnesses helps keep at least some of them from going back to jail. Get that junkie off heroin, and maybe he won\u2019t steal your car stereo for fix money; get that mentally ill homeless person on proper medications, and maybe she can find a job instead of turning tricks in alleys. \u201cIt\u2019s not the drug itself, it\u2019s the stealing and robbing they do to get the drug,\u201d says Abbie Zimmerman, a therapist atTransitions Clinic, a program based in San Francisco\u2019s hard-bitten Hunter\u2019s Point area that treats former prisoners (including Sanders, who is now an outreach worker there). \u201cIf I can keep them sober, I can keep them out of jail.\u201d\n\nBut no one has been willing to pay for such treatment for hundreds of thousands of ex-cons. And they certainly can\u2019t afford it themselves: According to a recent report by the Council of State Governments, the vast majority of released prisoners re-enter society with little money and no health insurance. But now many of those former prisoners are eligible for insurance, courtesy of the federal government.\n\nAmong many other reforms, the ACA is drastically expanding Medicaid, the federal insurance scheme for the poor. Previously, able-bodied childless adults were generally not covered by Medicaid, regardless of how impoverished they might have been. But starting this year, any American citizen under age 65 with a family income at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty line\u2014about $25,000 for a family of three\u2014is eligible for Medicaid (at least in the two dozen states that have so far agreed to participate in this aspect of Obamacare). Meanwhile, citizens and legal immigrants earning between 138 percent and 400 percent of the poverty line are now entitled to subsidies to help pay for private insurance. Taken together, those two provisions mean that tens, perhaps hundreds, of thousands of the inmates released every year are now eligible for health insurance, including coverage for mental health and substance abuse services.\n\nProviding treatment to those former prisoners could yield enormous benefits for all of us. The average cost to incarcerate someone for a year is roughly $25,000. That means if only one percent of each year\u2019s released inmates stay out of trouble, taxpayers will save nearly $200 million annually\u2014and the pool of troubled ex-cons looking to steal your car stereo will be that much smaller. \u201cSuccess in implementing the Affordable Care Act has the potential to decrease crime, recidivism, and criminal justice costs, while simultaneously improving the health and safety of communities,\u201d sums up a recent report by the federal Department of Justice.\n\nIt all looks great on paper. But there are significant obstacles to making this work in the real world. One is the simple fact that many former prisoners aren\u2019t even aware of their new entitlements. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what Obamacare is,\u201d says Ernest Kirkwood, a Transitions client who spent 29 years in prison, when I tell him I\u2019d like to talk to him about the new health care regime. \u201cI never read the newspaper.\u201d\n\nMaking services available is one thing. Getting people whose judgment isn\u2019t that great in the first place to actually use them is another. Plenty of drug users and mentally ill people don\u2019t want to admit they have a problem. The stigma that persists around mental illness keeps some should-be patients away. Richard Rawson, a professor of psychiatry specializing in substance abuse at the University of California, Los Angeles, points out that an earlier experiment that provided residential treatment to just-released drug offenders didn\u2019t work as well as hoped. \u201cPeople said, \u2018I just got out, I don\u2019t want to be in rehab for another year,\u2019\u201d he says. And of course, many former inmates need more than just treatment to keep them straight\u2014basics like decent housing and a job are also critical.\n\n\u201cEven with all that, this is a watershed opportunity,\u201d says Rawson. \u201cIt should put a significant dent in recidivism, no question.\u201d Accordingly, government agencies, public health officials, and prisoner support organizations across the country are working to connect inmates with Obamacare. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to enable people to enroll at many points in the criminal justice system, so they can walk into services the day they leave prison,\u201d says Maureen McConnell, a spokesperson for Treatment Alternatives for Safe Communities, a Chicago non-profit. Her group, working with the Cook County Sheriff\u2019s Department, is sending outreach workers into jails to get thousands of inmates started on the paperwork before they\u2019re released. Illinois Governor Pat Quinn has formed a working group targeting the issue. Massachusetts has implemented an electronic Medicaid application system for inmates leaving incarceration. Similar efforts are underway in California, Maryland, and other states.\n\nEven the most determined outreach campaign won\u2019t succeed in enrolling every single former prisoner, and not all of those who enroll will bother getting treatment. But at least some will get the help they need when they are sent back out on the streets. That should save them a lot of trouble\u2014and the rest of us a bundle.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Vince Beiser", "description": "An astonishing two-thirds of the 730,000 prisoners released each year have substance abuse or mental health problems.
