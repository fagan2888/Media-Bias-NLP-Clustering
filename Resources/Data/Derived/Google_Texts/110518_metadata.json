Over the last year, there have been countless musical tributes to the victims.\n\nThis hour, we share some of the music that came out of this tragedy.\n\nSome of it comes from a concert broadcast on WNPR's Where We Live one week after the shooting. It was hosted at the Asylum Hill Congregational Church in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nWe'll also hear music from the Strings For Newtown concert held on December 1, 2013 at Newtown Congregational Church.\n\nThere is one song that was recorded before the tragedy. Acclaimed jazz saxophonist Jimmy Greene recorded a song called \"Ana Grace,\" which was for his daughter Ana M\u00e1rquez-Greene, who died one year ago today.\n\nListen to the full hour of music, remembering the victims of Newtown, CT on the one-year anniversary.\n\nSong List:", "article_metadata": {"category": "Arts/Culture", "description": "It's been one year since the tragic shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School transformed Newtown, Connecticut, the country, and the world.
