Its appearance each year is met with enthusiasm and excitement, and its usefulness immediately cripples productivity. There are few who execute it correctly, and even fewer who wield its power even past its first phases.\n\nBy mid-March, the supply has quintupled, and the planet is overwhelmed. What was a rare commodity weeks before over saturates the market, and quickly warps and mutates, until it is unrecognizable from the form in which it originally appeared.\n\nWhen the end of the month comes, humanity burns the entire supply, freeing themselves of its addictive grasp, questioning why they even bothered to use such a corrosive, unmanageable entity - save for several champions who had mastered its use in its brief time here.\n\nThat resource is, of course, the bracket.\n\nFinally finished my bracket! What do you guys think? pic.twitter.com/gbRBDwSaAI \u2014 Shabba Thanks (@Trilladelphian) March 17, 2014\n\nWhat started as a means for predicting the outcomes of NCAA March Madness has reached its half-life of the season. Now, one cannot turn a head without being made aware of some insignificant acquaintance\u2019s bracket results, or seeing a web site\u2019s attempt to stay relevant in March by setting up their own bracket of favorite movies, media personalities, temperatures, dinosaurs, their own personal friends, etc.\n\nThe bracket is the dominant force on Earth through the Month of March. And it is time we made any sort of attempt to wrangle it into submission, if we are to survive it for another year.\n\nThe first step is of course to arrange the brackets into brackets.\n\nThe goal here is to get eliminated, or get \"Duke'd.\" The seedings are based on the inanity, uselessness, unoriginality, and/or stupidty - the higher the seed, the dumber the bracket.\n\nMay the dumbest bracket take the bracket.\n\nENTERTAINMENT DIVISION\n\nSelfies, TV couples, reality television - is there anything that matters less in a world where the wars from the '80s are being recycled and planes are just completley disappearing? Of course not. These are celebrity selfies, so you understand how valuable they are.\n\n1 Celebrity selfies (Examiner.com)\n\n16 Fictional presidents (The Wire)\n\n8 Teen TV madness (Forever Young Adult)\n\n9 Bilboard Hot 100 (Billboard)\n\n5 TV couples (Zimbio)\n\n12 Worst lyrics (Low Times Podcast)\n\n4 Cougar Madness (Thunder Treats)\n\n13 Old School TV (MeTV)\n\n6 Seinfeld epsiodes (FOX Sports)\n\n11 Best Twitter (The Wire)\n\n3 Reality TV Rumble (Vulture)\n\n14 \"The Wire\" characters (Grantland)\n\n7 Top Miramax Films (Miramax)\n\n10 Hulu: Best in Show (Hulu)\n\n2 Fug Madness (Go Fug Yourself)\n\n15 \"Game of Thrones\" characters (Screen Junkies)\n\nSPORTS\n\nSports is one of the more egregious offenders, but what are offseason sports blog supposed to do in March? This is sadly where most of the repetition from previous years come from, and if the bracket gimmick has anything going for it, it's that a new, funny idea may catch on. But no, once again we're having media popularity contests.\n\nSports people also tend to dominate the \"Seinfeld bracket\" population, for some reason. I suppose the majority of sports writers still wish it was the '90s.\n\n1 Best NY Giants Plays Ever (Giants.com)\n\n16 Best MLB Nicknames (FTW)\n\n8 Media Madness (The Big Lead)\n\n9 College coach duos (CBS Sports)\n\n5 Worst Twitter\n\n12 Best Wrestlemania (PWTorch)\n\n4 NJ sports figures (NJ.com)\n\n13 Bitchy fans bracket (Deadspin)\n\n6 Best MLB players (Bleacher Report)\n\n11 Mustache madness (Philly.com)\n\n3 Franchise frenzy (Colin Cowherd)\n\n14 Top school Olympian (NBC Sports)\n\n7 Top NFL QB's (NFL.com)\n\n10 BCS as NCAA tourney\n\n2 Philly sports media (Crossing Broad)\n\n15 NCAA mascots (SB Nation)\n\nNIGHT IN DIVISION\n\nWhy not curl up tonight with a copy of President Obama's Affordable Care Act? And then hop online and vote for your favorite reasons to get health insurance?\n\nIf you're reaction was \"What in the hell are you talking about,\" you have the right mindset on the U.S. Government's #1 uselessness seed in this division. Then there's American Jesus, which is a tournament of Jesuses, etc. If there's something you entertain yourself with on a Friday night at home, chances are somebody has designed a bracket to rank 64 of them.\n\n1 Affordable Care Act (WhiteHouse.gov)\n\n16 This guy's best friend bracket (@CUCCI_MANE30)\n\n7 Middle-earth Madness (TheOneRing.net)\n\n10 Best Nic Cage freakout (The Wire)\n\n3 Best Romance Novel (MySideline.com)\n\n14 Sci-fi vs. Fantasy (io9)\n\n5 Iconic t-shirts (Custom Ink)\n\n12 Best dinosaur (The Wire)\n\n2 Best slippers (BunnySlippers.com)\n\n15 American Jesus (The American Jesus)\n\n8 Heroes vs. villains (Hit Fix)\n\n9 Star Trek vs. Star Wars (Geek Twins)\n\n4 Fruits and veggies (SB Nation)\n\n13 Best 'Sunny' episode bracket\n\n6 Star Wars (This is madness)\n\n11 Best Nic Cage flicks (SB Nation)\n\nNIGHT OUT DIVISION\n\nBut no! You won't spend another night, wallowing in t-shirts and dinosaurs. You'll go out into the world, where there are smart phones and drugs and alcohol and southern towns.\n\nZodiac signs claimed the top seed, edging out a field of 64 southern towns and a bracket determining people's favorite temperature. Upsets abound in this division, however, and a peak at the overall bracket of brackets will show that some of these were even more useless than we originally thought.\n\n1 Best zodiac sign (The Wire)\n\n16 Bracket of Life (@Ohh_Dea)\n\n7 Smartphone Madness (Laptop Magazine)\n\n10 Best drink (The Wire)\n\n3 Best temperature (The Wire)\n\n14 Best celebrity mugshot (@SnagFilms)\n\n5 Best fast food (The Wire)\n\n12 Condiment Madness (National Hot Dog and Sausage Council)\n\n2 Greatest Southern Towns (Garden and Gun)\n\n15 Drugs vs. alcohol (Jezebel)\n\n6 Best chicken (The Wire)\n\n11 Best BBQ (I Love Alamabama Food)\n\n4 Best college (The Wire)\n\n13 Worst company in America (Consumerist)\n\n8 Best city (The Wire)\n\n9 Best bar foods (Zagat)\n\nFug Madness\n\nIf you\u2019re like me, \u201cfug madness\u201d sounds like a sale of some kind, as if there is a type of shoe called a \u201cfug\u201d that Target is selling to cheap cheap cheap. But no, \u201cfug\u201d in this sense refers to the usage of the term made famous by Moe on the Simpsons:\n\nMoe: I've been called ugly\u2026 pug ugly\u2026 fugly\u2026 pug fugly\u2026 but never ugly ugly.\n\nYes, one bracket, courtesy of the serpents at a web site called \u201cGo Fug Yourself,\u201d is a voting tournament to determine \u201cwhich celebrity had the fugliest year.\u201d\n\nPeople like looking at celebrities, and they like insulting them as if they\u2019re not people, so that they may feel better about their own problems, or better yet, become famous themselves. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty despicable,\u201d you might say. And you\u2019d be right, in general, except during the month of March, when GFY uses their position as \u201cjudgmental strangers on the internet\u201d to turn their year-round inferiority complex into a gag more likely to get them page views than their usual sleaze.\n\nBest New York Giants plays in history\n\nNot sure how you can form a list like this without including the clear winner, but it\u2019s oversights like that that put this bracket in the final four.\n\nThis probably wasn\u2019t the best year to attempt a bracket featuring top Giants plays. Perhaps it was initially limited to plays from the previous year, like the Colts are doing, but upon looking back, the creators realized the archives of successful play footage for the 2013-14 New York Giants is mostly barren.\n\nPlays you can vote on include:\n\n- A referee standing and screaming over the still body of Joe Montana, knocked unconscious by the Giants\u2019 defense.\n\n- Victor Cruz catching a touchdown pass in 2011 in front of a Jets sideline that appears bored with their own incompetence. If one of your best franchise moments is against the Jets, you are in dire need of some better moments.\n\n- Some of them, like George Martin\u2019s sack of John Elway in Super Bowl XXI, appear on the list twice. Nice try, the Giants.\n\nBest temperature\n\nThis weirdly doesn\u2019t even need an explanation. You know \u201ctemperatures?\u201d The numerical measurement of how cold or warm it is outside? Yeah. Which one of those do you like the most. That\u2019s what The Wire is asking.\n\nThe Wire was doing a new bracket every day, which would require them to dig deep into the toxic waste dump of terrible bracket ideas, and in its own way was a commentary on the ridiculousness.\n\nSo they came out \u201cbest temperature,\u201d a tournament that allowed you to pick the degrees at which you are most comfortable. Which makes you wonder, is this something people want to feel passionately about? Is global warming a factor? Just kidding, we all know that\u2019s a lie concocted by gay scientists. Would hundreds of college students fill a seating section dressed in shirts like \u201c70 is heaven-ty!\u201d or \u201cWelcome to hell-sius!\u201d or \u201cLife isn\u2019t fair-enheit!\u201d or something that makes sense; you know what I mean.\n\nThe answer is \u201cprobably,\u201d college students can get excited about anything if you put in a gym. It\u2019s an admirable tribute. Still, though. What temperature do you think would win a contest like this? 73 degrees?\n\nYeah. That\u2019s what won.\n\nAffordable Care Act\n\nOh, poor, sweet, American government. Somewhere, in some room, some group of government social media specialists agreed that they had the inside track on men, ages 18-45, by putting the Affordable Care Act in the form of a bracket.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re into NCAA basketball right now!\u201d one of them shouted, reading data as it came through their data output machine.\n\n\u201cIf we can turn this legislation into a 64-team bracket somehow, they\u2019ll never know the distance!\u201d another exclaimed.\n\nThey all nodded in agreement, and thus began a long night of work. What they settled on was \u201cthe 16 sweetest reasons to get covered,\u201d to the delight of youths everywhere.\n\n\u201cAnd look!\u201d cried America\u2019s youth population. \u201cThere are cat .gifs on White House web site! Truly, this cause has won my support.\u201d Not just that, but hot, fan favorite reasons like \u201cNobody\u2019s invincible\u201d and \u201cwomen can\u2019t be charged more than men\u201d were pitted against each other in the first round. Of course, without a seeding order, we have no idea whether it\u2019s an upset or not.\n\nThe point here is somebody finally found a way to make health insurance and the government cool and sexy again.", "article_metadata": {"pubdate": 20160524, "editdate": "20140322T09:04:29", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/pattisonave/The-Phillycom-super-useless-Meta-Bracket.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/bracket.JPG", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Philly.com super useless meta-bracket"}, "cg": "sports", "keywords": "Justin Klugh", "description": "In March, we are reintroduced to one of Earth\u2019s precious resources.
