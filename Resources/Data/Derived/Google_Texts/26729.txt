A former Arizona county sheriff who's been an ardent Obamacare opponent is turning to the Internet to raise $30,000 to cover mounting medical bills for himself and his ailing wife.Neither Richard Mack, a founder of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, who's recovering from a heart attack in January, nor his wife, who became ill last year, have health insurance, Talking Points Memo reports. "Since it appears that recovery will take a good deal of time with associated expenses, I struggle to not feel stress – both the stress of thinking about huge hospital and other medical bills as well as regular living expenses while I am unable to work – and also the stress of not being able to accomplish what I am so passionate about doing for others," Mack wrote on his GoFundMe page. "It is difficult and humbling to say that we need your help, but we do."By Friday, the site collected just over $17,500."Their modest personal resources alone aren’t sufficient to carry them through these crises," friends of the former sheriff wrote on the site."With the family's permission, we (local friends) are dispensing this call for help, to ask for your financial contributions. We are confident that you will want to be a part of the recovery process, to put a stop to Sheriff Mack's challenges and help him bounce back to great health and work."In a fiery document posted by TPM outlining how state governments can block President Barack Obama, Mack, who's also known for supporting Cliven Bundy in his standoff against the federal government, writes the states "do not have to take or support or pay for Obamacare or anything else from Washington DC. The States are not subject to federal direction."Even those who disagree with Mack offered donations, including one man who identified himself as a "Georgia Democrat" and wrote Friday: "Everyone … deserves adequate health care. Please pay the kindness you are receiving forward."
