John Cornyn has launched the first statewide ad blitz of his re-election effort, and he\u2019s keeping his aim squarely on President Barack Obama, ignoring Rep. Steve Stockman, his best-known rival in the March primary:\n\n\u201cASTONISHINGLY LIBERAL\u201d: In a 30-second TV spot and a minute-long radio version, Cornyn calls Obama \u201castonishingly liberal.\u201d He ominously accuses Obama of trying to \u201cchange the very fabric of American life,\u201d with references to Obamacare, the Benghazi attack and allegations that the IRS targeted conservative groups. The ads assert that Cornyn is standing up to the administration. \u201cLifelong conservative. Pro-life. Lives the Second Amendment. Tight-fisted with our taxpayer dollars. Fights for the truth from a dishonest administration,\u201d the narrator says.\n\nAIRING STATEWIDE: The campaign wouldn\u2019t give precise figures on how much it\u2019s spending on the ads, but an aide called it \u201ca substantial statewide buy\u201d at a cost \u201cwell into six figures.\u201d The aide called it \u201cthe start of what will be a multimillion-dollar ad campaign.\u201d Cornyn had a stockpile of $7 million going into the primary.\n\nFOCUS ON OBAMA: Taking on the president rather than Stockman, R-Friendswood, reflects a standard tactic for incumbents: treat challengers as pesky and insignificant for as long as possible. And Cornyn has a closely allied group that has been doing the dirty work for him. Texans for a Conservative Majority, run by Cornyn loyalists, launched its first TV ad attacking the congressman this week.\n\nGUN BILL: Also Friday, Cornyn announced support for a bill that would let people with a concealed-carry gun permit use that permit in any other state that allows concealed-carry \u2014 essentially treating the permits like a driver\u2019s license, he said. Earlier this week, Stockman accused Cornyn of an \u201caggressive expansion of the anti-gun agenda,\u201d citing his stated goal of making it harder for people with serious mental illness to have access to guns.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He keeps the focus on President Barack Obama rather than chief rival Rep.
