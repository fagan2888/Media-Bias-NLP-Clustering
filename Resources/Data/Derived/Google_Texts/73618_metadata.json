Jan Brewer ordered that flags at all state public buildings and the State Capitol be flown at half-staff from sunrise until sunset.\n\nAn American flag that flew over Ground Zero at the World Trade Center in New York was raised on a fire truck\u2019s ladder outside City Hall in downtown Phoenix. Inside the City Hall atrium, the Phoenix mayor, and the police and fire chiefs were among the dozens paying respect at a morning ceremony.\n\n\u201cToday, we honor all those who lost their lives on Sept. 11, 2001, and we especially honor those who ran to our rescue,\u201d Mayor Greg Stanton said.\n\nThe event included a bell ringing, the folding of a U.S. flag and the placement of two wreathes. One was placed on the bell, which belongs to the city\u2019s Hall of Flame Fire Museum, and the other on a piece of metal taken from Ground Zero.\n\nThe Tempe Exchange Club put up 3,000 U.S. flags in a \u201chealing field\u201d in Tempe Beach Park for the 11th year. Each flag honors a victim who died in the attacks. A card bearing the name of a victim along with a brief biography is tied to each flag. The display drew more people to the park than usual for a Thursday morning, according to a bicycle patrolman.\n\nMary Acevedo, 28, who has lived in Tempe for several years, visited the display for the first time. She brought her 1-year-old daughter and 2 \u00bd-year-old son, who loves American flags. She wants her kids to eventually know about the events of 9/11. She commended the inclusion of names of victims and their stories in the display.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re able to connect to the people and what happened,\u201d Acevedo said. \u201cIt gets to your heart and makes you really understand. We need that as Americans.\u201d\n\nKenny Caron said he was glad the display included not just first responders.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want to forget the regular people. They went to work one day and un unfortunate event happened. It could\u2019ve happened to anyone of us,\u201d Caron said.\n\nOfficials in Tucson held a 15-minute ceremony that included a flag-raising and the ringing of a memorial bell. Tucson firefighters led 300 people in the 9/11 Tower Challenge at the University of Arizona Stadium. Participants climbed 2,071 steps to honor the first responders who climbed stairs at the World Trade Center.\n\nIn Prescott, officials dedicated a 9/11 Survivor Tree outside a fire station.\n\nMore than 3,000 people were killed on Sept. 11, 2001, when terrorists hijacked airliners and flew them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. A fourth aircraft crashed in Pennsylvania.\n\nCommemorations were held across the country, including in New York City and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and at the Pentagon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cities throughout Arizona paused Thursday to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Cities throughout Arizona paused Thursday to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.", "title": "Arizona communities remember 9/11 attacks", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/11/911-attacks-to-be-remembered-around-arizona/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/11/12117fdec9256e235f0f6a7067008d80.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/11/12117fdec9256e235f0f6a7067008d80.jpg", "description": "Cities throughout Arizona paused Thursday to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.", "card": "summary", "title": "Arizona communities remember 9/11 attacks"}, "Author": "TERRY TANG", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "PHOENIX (AP) - Cities throughout Arizona paused Thursday to commemorate the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\nMore than 3,000 people were killed on Sept. 11, 2001, when terrorists hijacked airliners and flew them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.\nParticipants climbed 2,071 steps to honor the first responders who climbed stairs at the World Trade Center.\nTucson firefighters led 300 people in the 9/11 Tower Challenge at the University of Arizona Stadium.\nAn American flag that flew over Ground Zero at the World Trade Center in New York was raised on a fire truck\u2019s ladder outside City Hall in downtown Phoenix."}
