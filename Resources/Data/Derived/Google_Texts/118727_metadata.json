Tanner explained that part of the issue lies in the fact that nearly \u201c50 percent of the active nurses across the country are over 50 years old ... they\u2019re aging out faster than they\u2019re coming in.\u201d\n\nAnd this raises two issues: How to fill the spots of retiring nurses, and how to care for the rapidly growing aging population (also known as the impending \u201cSilver Tsunami\u201d).\n\nLucky for us, Santa Barbara County is up for the challenge.\n\nPart of the solution lies with our ability to help newly graduated nurses gain experience in the field so they can more easily land jobs at the hospitals and clinics that need them, because it\u2019s not just about filling the positions, but about what Herb Geary, chief nursing officer at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, describes as a \u201cskill dilution\u201d issue.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t have a nursing unit staffed with eight nurses, and seven of them have less than a year experience,\u201d he said.\n\nLocal health-care leaders such as Cottage Health and Sansum Clinic \u2014 together with nursing education programs at Santa Barbara City College, CSU Channel Islands and others \u2014 are bringing a multitude of solutions and opportunities to the table.\n\nLast year, Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital premiered its new \u201cTransition Program.\u201d As Geary explained it, the program is \u201cfor nurses who have worked for greater than a year and less than three (years) ... in a doctor\u2019s office, a nursing home, an outpatient surgery center\u201d and that, though \u201cthey have never worked in a hospital, as a new graduate, they have worked some place where they\u2019re practicing nursing.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the program was so successful in quickly orienting nurses to a hospital work environment that the organization will be offering the same opportunity again in July.\n\nAt Sansum, meanwhile, \u201cwell over half\u201d of its newly hired nursing staff have been trained through local education programs, according to Michael Yee, director of nursing.\n\nNursing is not only experiencing changes in its employment and education opportunities; technology and accessibility of care are also pushing the limits of the industry, for the better.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting time,\u201d Tanner said. \u201cThe technology is huge ... (and) accessibility of care is getting super easy.\u201d\n\nAt Visiting Nurse & Hospice Care, Tanner and her staff have been implementing a number of new technologies to make access to care for their patients not just easier, but more effective.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an app called Honor ... it\u2019s like an Uber but it\u2019s for private-duty nursing,\u201d she said.\n\nDeveloped by Honor Technology Inc., a Silicon Valley startup, the app allows patients, doctors or family members to put in a detailed request for care and have a private-duty nurse visit them in the comfort of their own home.\n\nThen there is \u201c\u200bTelehealth,\u201d which is essentially an iPad-turned-health monitor, allowing patients to monitor specific aspects of their own health from home and send it directly to their doctors.\n\n\u201cWe get real-time information and ... we\u2019re promoting wellness behaviors\u201d as patients play a stronger role in their own care, Tanner said.\n\nYee noted that Sansum is \u201cone of the first providers in Santa Barbara County to implement the Epic Electronic Health Record System (EHR), which has turned out to be one of the premier systems throughout the U.S.\u201d\n\nAs more patients have the opportunity to receive care in their homes, this not only frees up space in hospitals, but increases the ease of access to care that people need.\n\n\u201cWith Obamacare, we have many, many, many more people insured \u2014 and it\u2019s a really good thing,\u201d noted Cheryll Willin, clinical director of Oncology Services at Sansum Clinic\u2019s Cancer Center of Santa Barbara.\n\n\u201cWe have a sense of optimism that with more people covered, more people will have access to care \u2014 and being in health care that\u2019s really important.\u201d\n\nAs more patients begin flooding into local clinics and hospitals, physicians and nurses are finding new ways to streamline care. Willin said she is hopeful \u201cthat (Santa Barbara) would choose to create a model health-care system between the neighborhood clinics, community physician practices, Cottage Hospital, Sansum and a Cancer Center.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt could be an amazing model for care,\u201d she said.\n\nFrom the sound of it, we are well on our way. Yee expressed similar optimism and goals for future integration of the local health system.\n\n\u201cSansum is currently cooperating with government agencies, local hospitals, other clinics and single-physician practices to integrate the electronic health record, utilization of resources and coordination of health care,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like to see this trend spread throughout the county and the state.\u201d\n\nAnd, on the topic of care integration, Geary explained the growing popularity of \u201ca new buzz word called \u2018population health,\u2019 where hospitals work with community partners in trying to address population issues \u2014 whether it\u2019s around childhood obesity or lack of access to fresh produce,\u201d looking at problematic health trends in the community and working to solve them as a unified health-care system.\n\nThe common expectation in the nursing community, it seems, is that health care is making its way out of hospitals and back into the communities it is meant to serve.\n\n\u201cNursing started with physicians making home visits ... and so we\u2019re kind of going back that way,\u201d Tanner said.\n\nAs the needs of our community continue to grow, \u201cnursing is going to take on a lot of those roles,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite the rapid changes facing our national and local health-care system, one thing is certain: the need for nurses is not diminishing. Demand for qualified nurses continues to increase as schools and hospitals continue to improve their programs.\n\nEaster Moorman, director of marketing at Visiting Nurse & Hospice Care, summed it up beautifully.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to health care, it\u2019s going to take team work, it\u2019s going to take a village,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything from the clinic to the physician\u2019s office to the home \u2014 it\u2019s going to take all of us.\u201d\n\nAnd thanks to the nurses who serve our community 24/7 and the hospitals and clinics that support them, we are finding new ways to provide better care every day.\n\n\u2014 Noozhawk contributing writer Kellie Kreiss can be reached at [email protected].
