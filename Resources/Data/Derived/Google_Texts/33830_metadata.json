John Felker will run day-to-day operations, moving over from a senior private sector cyber position at HP Enterprise Services.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe DHS cyber center \u2014 known as the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) \u2014 is the government\u2019s main intake facility for private sector cyber threat information. The center analyzes the data, dishing out warnings and advice to other government agencies, as well as to private companies.\n\n\u201cDr. Ozment and Mr. Felker will provide a combination of operational experience, leadership, and strategic insight needed to take the NCCIC to the next level for our cybersecurity,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a statement.\n\nLawmakers have been pushing to give the NCCIC a greater role in defending the nation\u2019s networks from hackers.\n\nLegislation passed late last year officially codified the center\u2019s role for the first time. And several bills pending this year would increase the volume of data the NCCIC would have to process from the private sector.\n\nAs a result, DHS has been boosting the NCCIC\u2019s responsibilities.\n\n\u201cGiven the central importance of the NCCIC to the DHS cybersecurity mission, I have determined that we must elevate the NCCIC within our department\u2019s structure, with an incident reporting line directly to me as Secretary,\u201d Johnson said Monday.\n\nThe department will also restructure NCCIC in the coming months so it is focused \u201con strengthening our operational capabilities for mitigating and responding to cyber incidents,\u201d Johnson added.\n\nFor almost a year, the center has been without permanent leadership. The previous director, Larry Zelvin, retired last August after three decades in government spent helping businesses thwart malicious hackers.\n\nIn several congressional hearings this year, Johnson told lawmakers he was looking for \u201ca recognized all-star\u201d to head his agency\u2019s cybersecurity hub.\n\nIt appears that all-star was already at the agency.\n\nOzment will now play double-duty, retaining his current position.\n\nBefore coming to the DHS, Ozment was President Obama\u2019s senior director for cybersecurity at the White House. He\u2019s also been in cyber roles at the Defense Department and the National Security Agency.\n\nBefore moving to HP, Felker was the vice president of cyber programs at SCI Consulting.\n\nFelker's industry career was preceeded by three decades with the U.S. Coast Guard. During that time, he served as deputy commander of the agency\u2019s Cyber Command, where he ran day-to-day operations. Felker also oversaw the Coast Guard\u2019s cryptologic group.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The center had been without a permanent leader for a year.", "description": "The center had been without a permanent leader for a year.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cory Bennett", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The center had been without a permanent leader for a year.", "title": "DHS names new cyber hub head", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/250782-dhs-names-new-cyber-hub-head", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/video_images/dhs_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/250782-dhs-names-new-cyber-hub-head", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-10T17:48-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Cory Bennett", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-10T17:48:27-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/250782-dhs-names-new-cyber-hub-head", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The center had been without a permanent leader for a year.", "card": "summary", "title": "DHS names new cyber hub head"}, "dcterms.title": "DHS names new cyber hub head"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbda2\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTThe DHS cyber center \u2014 known as the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) \u2014 is the government\u2019s main intake facility for private sector cyber threat information.\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) finally has someone to lead its increasingly important cybersecurity hub.\nJohn Felker will run day-to-day operations, moving over from a senior private sector cyber position at HP Enterprise Services.\nAndy Ozment, currently the assistant secretary of the DHS Office of Cybersecurity and Communication, will assume the top role.\nIn several congressional hearings this year, Johnson told lawmakers he was looking for \u201ca recognized all-star\u201d to head his agency\u2019s cybersecurity hub."}
