Creepy Uncle Sam is back, and he’s making it rain for “glitchy IT contractors” in the latest Generation Opportunity video.

The video pokes fun at all the money the government threw at contractors to setup and maintain health exchanges and is part of latest anti-Obamacare ad campaign by Generation Opportunity, a conservative organization targeting young people.

The campaign encourages young people to “opt-out” of the Affordable Care Act. But unlike other ads about Obamacare, it wasn’t funded by tax dollars.

GenOpp’s blog, Free the Future, highlights some of the contractor failures.

In one such failure, a worker quit her job with a contractor that was awarded $1 billion in federal money because she had little work.

The employees reportedly played games and napped at the office to pass the time.

Or the $474 million in federal money spent on exchange sites that failed in Massachusetts, Oregon, Nevada and Maryland.

“Their totals are just a fraction of the $4.698 billion that the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation calculates the federal government has approved for states since 2011 to help them determine whether to create their own exchanges and to assist in doing so. Still, the amount of money that now appears wasted is prompting calls for far greater accountability.”

But while this Uncle Sam is tossing hundred-dollar bills, the real one is making billions rain on contractors for failed exchanges.
