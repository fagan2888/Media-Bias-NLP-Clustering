Stoddard.\n\nThat panel was presented with a viewer who asked what would happen if an individual couldn\u2019t pay an insurance provider in the event of some medical situation that limited that individual\u2019s ability to pay.\n\nBut that might have been part of the plan, Krauthammer said. If an upper-middle class income earner is making too much to receive Obamacare subsidies, but winds up in a situation where they lose a significant amount of their wealth, that is part of the redistribution mechanism.\n\n\u201cOK, I\u2019ve got a solution,\u201d Krauthammer said. \u201cYou make [$80,000 a year] and you don\u2019t have any subsidies. You\u2019ve got a high premium and you lose a lot of money and you end up poor. Well then, you go back and reapply. Now you get a subsidy because you\u2019re poor. So that\u2019s how it would work in practice. Look that wasn\u2019t a joke. That was serious. This is a way of transferring wealth from the upper middle class where you get no subsidies to the lower middle class who aren\u2019t poor enough to end up in Medicaid.\u201d\n\nKrauthammer and Napolitano continued to play out how this works in theory, which is that this \u201cwealth\u201d would be moved around through the health care system via subsidies to those making too making too much to be on Medicaid, but are earning just little enough to qualify for those subsidies. It was a theory Stoddard questioned, but Krauthammer stuck to it, arguing this was something for which the White House had failed to see the political consequences.\n\nNAPOLITANO: So the \u201947 percent,\u2019 which impaled Romney will go over 50 percent if this legislation succeeds in moving people below the poverty level and making them dependent on the government. And they vote.\n\nKRAUTHAMMER: Which is part of the plan. However, if you were wealthier and you lose it and you end up on Medicaid, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll vote Democratic.\n\nSTODDARD: I really don\u2019t think the White House had a fantasy of this kind of a disaster. I just can\u2019t imagine \u2014\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nKRAUTHAMMER: You misunder \u2014 it\u2019s a political disaster. But the geniuses, the economists \u2014 if you hear Ezekiel Emanuel say on the \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d this was designed \u2014 you had to get people out of the individual insurance market, generally people of some means, you put them in the exchanges, they overpay and you use the subsidy. This was not an accident. What they never understood is how disastrous it would be politically. But economically, that\u2019s the way they make it work.\n\nBAIER: It is pretty incredible to try to get 5-7 million on the upside by March \u2014 the amount of money to try to get 7 million people in these exchanges.\n\nNAPOLITANO: It would be less expensive if they just paid the premiums for the 7 million out of the federal treasury.\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Poor", "description": "Columnist explains his theory on how health care law is used to redistribute in order to create larger dependent voting bloc", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "During the online-only portion of Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report\u201d on Wednesday night, Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer laid out his theory on what Obamacare\u2019s real intended pu", "title": "Krauthammer: Obamacare a tool to intentionally destroy wealth and create Democratic voters", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/07/krauthammer-obamacare-a-tool-to-intentionally-destroy-wealth-and-create-democratic-voters/", "image": {"width": 737, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CK117-e1383806200246.jpg", "height": 316}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'This was not an accident'", "title": "Krauthammer: Obamacare a tool to intentionally destroy wealth and create Democratic voters Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/07/krauthammer-obamacare-a-tool-to-intentionally-destroy-wealth-and-create-democratic-voters/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CK117-e1383806200246.jpg"}, "creator": "@jeff_poor", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-07 02:50:34", "sailthru.title": "Krauthammer: Obamacare a tool to intentionally destroy wealth and create Democratic voters", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "charles-krauthammer,obamacare,jeff-poor", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "charles krauthammer,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "During the online-only portion of Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report\u201d on Wednesday night, Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer laid out his theory on what Obamacare\u2019s real intended pu", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/CK117-e1383806200246.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "You\u2019ve got a high premium and you lose a lot of money and you end up poor.\nHowever, if you were wealthier and you lose it and you end up on Medicaid, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll vote Democratic.\nNAPOLITANO: It would be less expensive if they just paid the premiums for the 7 million out of the federal treasury.\nBut that might have been part of the plan, Krauthammer said.\n3951567During the online-only portion of Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report\u201d on Wednesday night, Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer laid out his theory on what Obamacare\u2019s real intended purpose is: an instrument to redistribute wealth."}
