Jeb Bush floated the idea that Obamacare can be repealed and replaced with an Apple Watch.\n\nVideo:\n\nAfter delivering the standard Republican mumbo jumbo about moving to \u201ca patient-centered system\u201d a.k.a. you\u2019re on your own. Bush suggested that smartphones can replace affordable health insurance, \u201cOn this device in five years will be applications that will allow me to manage my healthcare in ways that five years ago were not even possible. I\u2019ll have the ability, someone will, you know, because of my blood sugar, \u2026 someone will send me a signal it\u2019ll come here, I\u2019ll get a double beep saying \u2018you just ate a butterscotch sundae or something like that. You went way over the top. You\u2019re a diabetic, you can\u2019t do that\u2014whatever, we\u2019ll be able to guide our own healthcare decisions in a way that will make us healthy. Ultimately, we have to get to a health system, away from a disease system.\u201d\n\nThe problem with Bush\u2019s plan is that the app can\u2019t provide health care. In fact, what is missing in Bush\u2019s health care idea is health care. An app and a smartphone can\u2019t save a person from the crippling debt caused by a serious illness. An app isn\u2019t a substitute for a law that lowers the cost of health insurance, covers more people, and gives them access to free preventive medical care.\n\nAn Apple Watch can\u2019t hide the fact that under Jeb Bush fewer Americans will have health insurance. If the diabetic in Jeb Bush\u2019s example needed medical care, they would be screwed.\n\nRepublicans have floated some bogus ideas in their desperate attempts to fool people into believing that they have an alternative to the Affordable Care Act, but Jeb Bush\u2019s idea is one of the worst. Why do people have to choose between an Apple Watch and affordable health insurance? Why can\u2019t people have apps that work with their affordable health insurance?\n\nBush set up a false choice, but what was most telling was that during his remarks he had to tell the audience to applaud when he mentioned repealing Obamacare. Even Republicans aren\u2019t buying the Obamacare repeal rallying cry anymore.\n\nAn Apple Watch isn\u2019t a replacement for health insurance in the same way that Jeb Bush isn\u2019t a replacement for an intelligent president.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There is a new leader in the Republican race to the bottom.
