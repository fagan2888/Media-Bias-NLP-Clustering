As required by the JOBS Act, the rule does not apply to emerging growth companies.\n\nIn comment letters filed with the SEC, companies \u2014 mostly large, multinational ones \u2014 had raised strong objections to the proposed rule. Most were variations on two themes. For one, they said determining median pay within their work forces would be a difficult, costly process.\n\nThe rationale for that stance was generally two-fold: that most global companies use a patchwork of often incompatible payroll systems in the countries where they operate; and that definitions of \u201ccompensation\u201d are significantly different from country to country, given variability in the treatment of social benefits, health care, and taxes. There were also claims that further burdens would be imposed by the proposed (and now final) requirement to include part-time workers in the calculation of median pay.\n\nThe other objection theme was that the existing required CEO compensation disclosures were sufficient to allow investors to make informed decisions on buying stocks and voting their shares.\n\nThere is also a cost component to multinationals\u2019 discontent. For large companies doing business in dozens of countries, the cost of calculating the pay ratio could run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars, says Alan Johnson, managing director of compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates. Altogether, the SEC estimates, the aggregate cost in the first year for all companies subject to the rule will be $1.2 billion.\n\nIn a July 21 comment letter to the SEC, John Hayes, chief executive of Ball Corp. and chairman of the Business Roundtable, an association of CEOs, argued that the ratio should include full-time, domestic U.S. workers only. \u201cUnless all non-U.S., part-time and seasonal employees are excluded from the pay ratio calculation, the costs and burdens on companies imposed by the SEC\u2019s final rule will likely be exponentially higher than if the calculation were limited to full-time U.S. employees only,\u201d Ball wrote.\n\nCompanies had lobbied heavily for the SEC to let them exclude some worldwide employees from the calculation. Because wages are higher in the United States than in almost every other country in the world, the fewer foreign workers that are included, the lower a multinational\u2019s pay ratio will be.\n\nStill, the commission had found in two studies that pay ratios would not be significantly affected if a minority of employees were excluded. Even excluding 40% of employees would reduce the average pay ratio by only 11%, the SEC found.\n\nBut the final rule allows companies to exclude only 5% of their overseas workers. Not only did that not satisfy companies, as such exclusion will scarcely reduce their burden and compliance costs at all, it also didn\u2019t satisfy the AFL-CIO, the trade union federation, which has been among the most vocal, high-profile supporters of increased CEO compensation disclosure.\n\nThe AFL-CIO\u2019s objection was based on the wording in Dodd-Frank directing the SEC to issue rules for implementing the pay ratio provision. The statute says the commission must \u201crequire disclosure of the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of an issuer\u201d (emphasis added).\n\nThe final rule\u2019s departure from the requirement as stated in the statute seems almost certain to set the stage for protracted court battles similar to the one decided in June by the Supreme Court that examined the implications of precise wording in the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe statute is clear: \u2018all employees\u2019 means all employees,\u201d said Heather Slavkin Corzo, director of the AFL-CIO\u2019s Office of Investment, at a Tuesday news conference. Further, she noted that since the rule allows companies to employ statistical sampling methods and estimates in calculating median employee compensation, which she called a reasonable compromise, \u201cit\u2019s hard to understand the rationale for allowing companies to omit other segments of the work force from the calculation.\u201d\n\nCorzo brushed aside companies\u2019 claims that it would be difficult to arrive at a true median-pay figure because of differences in payroll systems and compensation policies that exist from country to country. \u201cIt raises concerns in terms of their internal controls over financial reporting, if they can\u2019t figure out how much they\u2019re paying their work force,\u201d she said.\n\nBut, says Steve Seelig, executive compensation counsel for consulting firm Towers Watson, that viewpoint is in a sense like confusing macroeconomics with microeconomics. \u201cCompanies are absolutely in control of and understand what their costs are when it comes to worker pay,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s far different from saying they can press a button and immediately access the pay data for all of their foreign workers.\u201d\n\nSEC chair Mary Jo White said in a statement, \u201cTo say that the views on the pay ratio disclosure requirement are divided is an obvious understatement. Since it was mandated by Congress, the pay ratio rule has been controversial, spurring a contentious and, at times, heated dialogue.\u201d The commission received more than 287,000 comment letters on the matter, White noted.\n\nIn addition to the 5% foreign-worker exclusion, the SEC made some last-minute amendments to the proposed rule that it says will ease companies\u2019 concerns:\n\nAllowing companies to use the same median-compensated employee for three years, \u201cunless there has been a change in the employee population or employee compensation arrangements that the company reasonably believes would result in a significant change in the pay ratio disclosure.\u201d\n\nAllowing companies to choose any date during the last three months of their fiscal year in determining the median compensation\n\nAn exemption for situations when foreign data privacy laws would prevent companies from being able to process or obtain the necessary compensation information to calculate the ratio\n\nAllowing companies to use cost-of-living adjustments when calculating median compensation\n\nIn addition to emerging growth companies, as defined in the rule, also exempt from the rule are smaller reporting companies, foreign private issuers, registered investment companies, and registrants filing under the U.S.-Canadian Multijurisdictional Disclosure System.\n\nThe Impact on CFOs\n\nAlthough their own compensation is not a facet of the pay ratio rule, there are assorted weighty issues for CFOs.\n\n\u201cIt will be hard to calculate, CFOs will be blamed if the calculation is wrong, and no one will believe it was an honest mistake,\u201d says Johnson.\n\nCalling it a \u201csilly calculation\u201d because of the inclusion of part-time workers (and opining that the rule\u2019s \u201csole purpose\u201d is to \u201cembarrass companies with a lot of low-paid, part-timers\u201d), Johnson stresses that CFOs should nonetheless take it seriously. \u201cIf you get caught cheating on this, the SEC will absolutely nail you to the wall,\u201d he says.\n\nFinance chiefs should also try to counteract any internal qualms if the company\u2019s CEO pay ratio is higher than a competitor\u2019s, according to Johnson. \u201cIf a board member says, \u2018Why are we at 178 and our competitor is 170? Can\u2019t we do something about that?\u2019 the right answer is probably, \u2018No, we can\u2019t.\u2019 Since it\u2019s just a political thing, don\u2019t mess around with it. If you are at 178 and your competitor is at 170, no one will really care. It\u2019s different from quarterly earnings, which really do matter, and people push the envelope on that. I would suggest that this is not something to push the envelope on.\u201d\n\nAccording to Andrew Liazos, a partner and head of the executive compensation practice at law firm McDermott Will & Emery, the permissible use of statistical sampling and estimates could leave companies vulnerable to strike suits claiming that their disclosures are misleading because of the calculation methods used. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find that there will be all kinds of different approaches being used, at least in the first year,\u201d he says.\n\nCFOs should also be aware of some potential \u201chidden costs\u201d of the rule, says Seelig of Towers Watson.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, employees are going to be privy to the median compensation,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have questions about whether they\u2019re paid fairly and whether the CEO\u2019s pay influences theirs. Companies are really going to have to confront these issues in communicating with the work force.\u201d\n\nExternal communication will also be important. Companies should prepare to respond to media inquiries about their ratios. \u201cIn most cases the ratio is going to appear very high, higher than most local newspaper readers had anticipated, regardless of how it compares to peer companies,\u201d Seelig says. That\u2019s important, as some studies have indicated that a company\u2019s pay ratio may influence consumer behavior, he notes.\n\nAlso, he says, there is \u201cplenty of opportunity for mischief\u201d in the form of state lawmakings related to the rule, such as imposing taxes on companies with high CEO pay ratios or giving favorable treatment to contractors with low ratios.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The final rule for Dodd-Frank-mandated CEO pay ratio disclosure disappoints its opponents and proponents alike.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"CEO Pay Ratio Rule Rankles Both Sides of Heated Debate\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/compensation\\/2015\\/08\\/ceo-pay-ratio-rule-rankles-sides-heated-debate\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-08-05 14:20:18\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-09-04 09:31:03\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":427095,\"author_id\":\"6\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"David McCann\",\"tags\":[\"AFL-CEO\",\"Alan Johnson\",\"CEO pay ratio\",\"Dodd-Frank\",\"Heather Corzo\"],\"categories\":[\"Compensation\",\"Global Business\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\",\"Regulation\",\"Risk &amp; Compliance\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.cfo.com\\/content\\/uploads\\/2015\\/08\\/Rich-guy.jpg\"}", "author": "David McCann", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "The final rule for Dodd-Frank-mandated CEO pay ratio disclosure disappoints its opponents and proponents alike.", "title": "CEO Pay Ratio Rankles Many", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.cfo.com/content/uploads/2015/08/Rich-guy.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-04T09:31:03+00:00", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/compensation/2015/08/ceo-pay-ratio-rule-rankles-sides-heated-debate/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "The final rule for Dodd-Frank-mandated CEO pay ratio disclosure disappoints its opponents and proponents alike.", "creator": "@cfo", "title": "CEO Pay Ratio Rankles Many", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "topicRoot": "Human Capital & Careers", "topic": "Compensation", "headline": "CEO Pay Ratio Rule Rankles Both Sides of Heated Debate", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "date": 20150805, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "Strategy", "tag": "Steve Seelig", "published_time": "2015-08-05T14:20:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-04T09:31:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "afl-ceo, alan johnson, ceo pay ratio, dodd-frank, heather corzo, heather slavkin corzo, pay ratio, sec, securities and exchange commission, stephen seelig, steve seelig"}, "article_summary": "Finance chiefs should also try to counteract any internal qualms if the company\u2019s CEO pay ratio is higher than a competitor\u2019s, according to Johnson.\nThat\u2019s important, as some studies have indicated that a company\u2019s pay ratio may influence consumer behavior, he notes.\nThe Impact on CFOsAlthough their own compensation is not a facet of the pay ratio rule, there are assorted weighty issues for CFOs.\nFor one, they said determining median pay within their work forces would be a difficult, costly process.\nThe AFL-CIO\u2019s objection was based on the wording in Dodd-Frank directing the SEC to issue rules for implementing the pay ratio provision."}
