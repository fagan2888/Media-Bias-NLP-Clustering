From the right of personal self-protection to public religious expressions, and from criminal justice matters to military policy issues. And we let them do it!\u201d\n\nBut Barton said that we \u201cseem to have forgotten a few basic principles that are worth reviewing.\u201d\n\nThe historian held up a copy of the Federalist Papers, saying it is considered the most authoritative constitutional commentary ever written.\n\n\u201cIn this book, the Founding Fathers who actually wrote the Constitution tell us, \u2018the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, the Constitution made the judiciary so weak that according to the Federalist Papers, \u2018the general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter.\u201d\n\nHow is that possible? Our founders explained, Barton said, that the judiciary \u201chas no influence over either the sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of society, and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have neither force nor will.\u201d\n\nIn fact, they tell us that, \u201cthere is not a syllable in the plan [the Constitution] which directly empowers the national courts to construe the laws according to the spirit of the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo wonder Progressives don\u2019t like the Constitution \u2014 it restrains them!\u201d Barton reflected. \u201cThey don\u2019t like to be held back from fundamentally transforming the country. It\u2019s no wonder that they work so hard to keep the Constitution from being taught in schools.\u201d\n\nBarton said that Thomas Jefferson long ago warned the people of leaving the Constitution to be interpreted by those who may or may not agree with what it says.\n\nThis is \u201ca very dangerous doctrine indeed,\u201d Jefferson is quoted as saying. \u201cThe Constitution has erected no such single tribunal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Constitution, on this hypothesis, is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the Judiciary which they may twist and shape into any form they please,\u201d he added.\n\nDavid Barton said that we have forgotten the words of the Founding Fathers, and need to go back and study the Constitution.\n\nAs John Jay, author of a number of the Federalist Papers and the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court advised: \u201cEvery member of the State ought diligently to read and to study the Constitution of his country\u2026By knowing their rights, they will sooner perceive when they are violated and be the better prepared to defend and assert them.\u201d\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nDavid Green, the founder and CEO of Hobby Lobby, also appeared on the program to discuss the monumental ramifications of the Affordable Care Act, which \u2014 to the surprise of many, the Supreme Court upheld as constitutional \u2014 on his business.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.
