I was insured. I think anyone who is going through a serious illness should have immediate responses. I shouldn\u2019t have to wait months, weeks, to even be considered for surgery that I should have had weeks ago.\u201d\n\nGracchi was forced to postpone her Jan. 3 biopsy and follow-up treatment at New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the largest private cancer center in the world, when her insurance rolled over into a new plan that was part of an exchange under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cAs of January 1, my insurance plan rolled over into a new ObamaCare plan that is part of the exchange and my doctors are no longer available in my network, so the surgeons that I was dealing with \u2026 I no longer have access to,\u201d Gracchi told Fox News.\n\nGracchi said Sloan-Kettering and her primary doctor are trying to help her get through the situation. She said she has had difficulty trying to find comparable doctors and surgeons that could assist her on Healthcare.gov, the ObamaCare website.\n\n\u201cThis is delaying all my treatment and surgery. Most people that get breast cancer don\u2019t wait this long to have a surgery, but it\u2019s as if I\u2019ve never had insurance at all,\u201d Gracchi added.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-01-30 02:18:23 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "A woman diagnosed with breast cancer, whose life-saving surgery has been postponed after she lost her doctors under ObamaCare, made a heartfelt plea to President Obama to amend the Affordable Care Act.", "twitter": {"description": "A woman diagnosed with breast cancer, whose life-saving surgery has been postponed after she lost her doctors under ObamaCare, made a heartfelt plea to President Obama to amend the Affordable Care Act.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/01/19/cancer-patients-treatment-put-on-hold-over-obamacare.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/011914/0/0/011914_ff_cancerpatient_640.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Cancer patient\u2019s treatment put on hold over ObamaCare", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"health\",\"title\":\"Cancer patient\\u2019s treatment put on hold over ObamaCare\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/011914/0/0/011914_ff_cancerpatient_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-19T15:56:48Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/01/19/cancer-patients-treatment-put-on-hold-over-obamacare.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"db84d619-1581-4c11-8291-2e727df4ccd9\",\"section\":\"health\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "A woman diagnosed with breast cancer, whose life-saving surgery has been postponed after she lost her doctors under ObamaCare, made a heartfelt plea to President Obama to amend the Affordable Care Act.", "dc.identifier": "db84d619-1581-4c11-8291-2e727df4ccd9", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "pagetype": "article", "description": "A woman diagnosed with breast cancer, whose life-saving surgery has been postponed after she lost her doctors under ObamaCare, made a heartfelt plea to President Obama to amend the Affordable Care Act.", "prism.section": "health", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.title": "Cancer Patient\u2019s Treatment Put On Hold Over Obamacare", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-30 02:18:23 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "A woman diagnosed with breast cancer, whose life-saving surgery has been postponed after she lost her doctors under ObamaCare, made a heartfelt plea to President Obama to amend the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Cancer patient\u2019s treatment put on hold over ObamaCare | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/01/19/cancer-patients-treatment-put-on-hold-over-obamacare.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/011914/0/0/011914_ff_cancerpatient_640.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-01-19", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"health\",\"title\":\"Cancer patient\\u2019s treatment put on hold over ObamaCare\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/011914/0/0/011914_ff_cancerpatient_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-19T15:56:48Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/01/19/cancer-patients-treatment-put-on-hold-over-obamacare.html\",\"post_id\":\"db84d619-1581-4c11-8291-2e727df4ccd9\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"health\"}"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda891\"", "article_summary": "Most people that get breast cancer don\u2019t wait this long to have a surgery, but it\u2019s as if I\u2019ve never had insurance at all,\u201d Gracchi added.\nA woman diagnosed with breast cancer, whose life-saving surgery has been postponed after she lost her doctors under ObamaCare, made a heartfelt plea Sunday to President Obama to amend the Affordable Care Act.\nShe said she has had difficulty trying to find comparable doctors and surgeons that could assist her on Healthcare.gov, the ObamaCare website.\nIn an exclusive appearance on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d Josie Gracchi, who has been diagnosed with ductal-invasive carcinoma, looked into the camera and addressed Obama: \u201cI would like my health care taken care of.\nGracchi said Sloan-Kettering and her primary doctor are trying to help her get through the situation."}
