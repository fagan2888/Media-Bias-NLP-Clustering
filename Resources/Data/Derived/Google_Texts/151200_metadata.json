The number is not known because Trump has not provided information on the size of the proposed block grant, the committee said.\n\nTransforming Medicaid to block grants to the states would mean replacing the current system, in which the federal government pays for a portion of state Medicaid costs, based on a matching rate, with a fixed federal amount each year.\n\n[Also: Trump releases plan to replace Obamacare]\n\nTrump policies to require price transparency and promote health savings accounts would likely be a fiscal wash, according to the committee.\n\nMeanwhile, the committee commended President Obama's budget, saying it provides sufficient revenue and spending cuts to pay for new initiatives and reduce projected deficits.\n\nThe administration's estimated net deficit reduction of $2.9 trillion through 2026, is in line with Congressional Budget Office estimates of $2.5 trillion, the committee said.\n\n\"The president's budget should be commended for not only responsibly paying for new initiatives, but identifying significant deficit reduction to stabilize the debt,\" the committee said.\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget was formed in 1981 by former Congressman Robert Giaimo, D-Conn. and former Senator Henry Bellmon, R-Oklahoma, according to its website.\n\nAccording to sourcewatch.org, which relies on contributed content, and The Huffington Post, the committee received funding from a foundation formed by Peter G. Peterson, a Wall Street billionaire who used his wealth in support for slashing Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nIn the 1990s, the committee formed a cost containment coalition that objected to President Clinton's healthcare reform proposals, according to both sources. It was later revealed that the former lobbying group, the Tobacco Institute, funded the coalition, both said.\n\nTwitter: @SusanJMorse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/donald-trumps-trumpcare-proposal-too-expensive-bad-uninsured-watchdog-group-says", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/TrumpFTR.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Donald Trump's plan to repeal and replace Obamacare would cost an estimated $270 billion over ten years and would nearly double the number of uninsured Americans, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit, bipartisan fiscal watchdog group.", "title": "Donald Trump's Trumpcare proposal too expensive, bad for uninsured, watchdog group says"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/TrumpFTR.png"}, "description": "Donald Trump's plan to repeal and replace Obamacare would cost an estimated $270 billion over ten years and would nearly double the number of uninsured Americans, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit, bipartisan fiscal watchdog group.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Donald Trump's Trumpcare proposal too expensive, bad for uninsured, watchdog group says"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Donald Trump's plan to repeal and replace Obamacare would cost an estimated $270 billion over ten years and would nearly double the number of uninsured Americans, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit, bipartisan fiscal watchdog group.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "On March 14, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget did an analysis of Donald Trump's recently released healthcare plan that proposes to repeal and replace Obamacare.\nTrump's plan for block granting Medicaid could save $25 to $850 billion.\nThe administration's estimated net deficit reduction of $2.9 trillion through 2026, is in line with Congressional Budget Office estimates of $2.5 trillion, the committee said.\nIn the 1990s, the committee formed a cost containment coalition that objected to President Clinton's healthcare reform proposals, according to both sources.\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget was formed in 1981 by former Congressman Robert Giaimo, D-Conn. and former Senator Henry Bellmon, R-Oklahoma, according to its website."}
