And the government rounded up a group of journalists in April 2014, accusing them of aiding terrorism, part of an ongoing pattern of stifling press freedoms, human-rights groups say.\n\nObama said he was not shy in urging Desalegn to expand space for political opponents and the media to speak freely.\n\n\u201cI think the prime minister will indicate I do not bite my tongue when it comes to these issues,\u201d Obama said, adding that \u201cthere\u2019s still more work to do.\u201d\n\nDesalegn said he is committed to adopting democratic reforms. \u201cWe\u2019re on the right track,\u201d he said.\n\nObama defended his decision to travel to Ethiopia, saying they can engage on mutual interests while discussing differences, \u201cthe same way we deal with China and a range of other countries.\u201d\n\nBut Obama appeared to frustrate human-rights groups when he twice referred to Ethiopia\u2019s government as \u201cdemocratically elected.\u201d\n\nJust last week, National Security Adviser Susan Rice questioned the legitimacy of the election, saying the U.S. has \u201csome concern for the integrity of the electoral process,\u201d including the opposition\u2019s ability to campaign freely.\n\n\u201cEthiopia is ruled by a brutal unrelenting dictatorship. Obama should say so,\u201d Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch, tweeted Monday.\n\nObama was expected to convene a meeting with African leaders later Monday on the conflict in South Sudan, where warring factions face an Aug. 17 deadline to accept an international peace deal.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of time to wait,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe conditions on the ground are getting much, much worse.\u201d\n\nIf the sides do not accept the terms, the new nation could face sanctions and an arms embargo from the U.S. and other nations. Obama said he would consider \u201cother tools\u201d if the South Sudanese reject the deal.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Ethiopia is a key partner in fighting the terrorist group al-Shabaab in Somalia.", "description": "Ethiopia is a key partner in fighting the terrorist group al-Shabaab in Somalia.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Jordan Fabian", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Ethiopia is a key partner in fighting the terrorist group al-Shabaab in Somalia.", "title": "Obama prods Ethiopia toward democratic reform", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/international/249243-obama-prods-ethiopia-toward-democratic-reform", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/obamabarack07272015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-27T11:53:02-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-27T11:53-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/international/249243-obama-prods-ethiopia-toward-democratic-reform", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-27T09:06-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Barack Obama,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-27T09:06:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-27T11:53:02-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/international/249243-obama-prods-ethiopia-toward-democratic-reform", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Ethiopia is a key partner in fighting the terrorist group al-Shabaab in Somalia.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama prods Ethiopia toward democratic reform"}, "dcterms.title": "Obama prods Ethiopia toward democratic reform"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe1f\"", "article_summary": "The president has faced criticism from human-rights groups for traveling to Ethiopia, saying his presence offers legitimacy to the country\u2019s government.\nPresident Obama on Monday prodded Ethiopia\u2019s government to address concerns over its poor human-rights record as he kicked off a historic two-day visit to the country.\nObama is the first sitting president to visit Ethiopia, and his trip is designed to promote trade and security ties with the East African nation, which has experienced rapid economic growth.\nAnd the government rounded up a group of journalists in April 2014, accusing them of aiding terrorism, part of an ongoing pattern of stifling press freedoms, human-rights groups say.\nObama said he had \u201ca frank discussion\u201d about promoting free speech and political dissent with Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn and other officials."}
