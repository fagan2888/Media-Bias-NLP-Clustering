The 241-186 vote fell short of the required two-thirds needed to block the veto.\n\nThough Republicans control the House and could have used their constitutional \u201cpower of the purse\u201d to defund Planned Parenthood in December, they caved to Democrats and instead passed a $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill that contained \u2013 among many other items on the establishment wish list \u2013 funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan said about the spending bill, \u201cDemocrats won some, they lost some; we won some, we lost some,\u201d reported Roll Call .\n\nYou continue to fund the largest abortion provider in the country under this #omnibus. #prolife #DefundPP https://t.co/9XQYEl70uE \u2014 Cong. Tim Huelskamp (@CongHuelskamp) December 16, 2015\n\nKnowing the leftwing media would have blamed them for an ensuing government shutdown if they refused to fund Planned Parenthood in the omnibus, GOP leadership surrendered and then attempted to save face with a show vote in early January \u2013 on a separate bill to repeal Obamacare and end Planned Parenthood funding. That measure passed Congress using the reconciliation process which requires fewer votes. Obama, predictably, vetoed it.\n\nHad Obama refused to sign the must-pass omnibus without Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding in December, it would have been the president himself who was to blame for a government shutdown. The new conservative media would then have stood behind Republican leaders in Congress for upholding their constitutional duty by refusing to fund a potentially criminal enterprise like Planned Parenthood.\n\nNow, however, we have a new year and Planned Parenthood is once again funded, and Obamacare is still rolling along.\n\nSome national pro-life leaders are declaring the override veto attempt to be a precedent-setting event \u2013 a Planned Parenthood defunding bill finally making it to the president\u2019s desk. They are praising a \u201cvaliant effort\u201d on the part of House Republicans, even a way to put Obama on record for continuing Planned Parenthood funding \u2013 as if he is not already on record saying, \u201cGod Bless Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nIn reality, more than one man has stood in the way of defunding Planned Parenthood in 2016. Republicans who approved the omnibus spending bill that funded the abortion business for most of this year could have rejected it, as did steadfast pro-life members of Congress.\n\nAs for a \u201cprecedent\u201d being set with the reconciliation show-vote, America already has a \u201cprecedent\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s called the Constitution. It tells us the House of Representatives can terminate funding for activities and programs it deems inappropriate. It\u2019s always easier to have a president in the White House who wants what you want. But, when you don\u2019t, it\u2019s time to fight and use the power and authority you have \u2013 and the Constitution provides.\n\nEvangelical leader Franklin Graham left the Republican Party after GOP leaders included Planned Parenthood funding in the omnibus spending bill.\n\n\u201cAfter all of the appalling facts revealed this year about Planned Parenthood, our representatives in Washington had a chance to put a stop to this, but they didn\u2019t,\u201d he posted on Facebook. \u201cSeeing and hearing Planned Parenthood talk nonchalantly about selling baby parts from aborted fetuses with utter disregard for human life is reminiscent of Joseph Mengele and the Nazi concentration camps! That should\u2019ve been all that was needed to turn off the faucet for their funding.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Fails To Override Obama Veto of Obamacare Repeal and Planned Parenthood Defund", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "House Fails To Override Obama Veto of Obamacare Repeal and Planned Parenthood Defund", "title": "House Fails To Override Obama Veto of Obamacare Repeal and Planned Parenthood Defund - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Paul-Ryan-I-Hate-the-Bill-AP-PhotoJ.-Scott-Applewhite.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/03/house-fails-to-override-obama-veto-of-obamacare-repeal-and-planned-parenthood-defund/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Fails To Override Obama Veto of Obamacare Repeal and Planned Parenthood Defund", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/Paul-Ryan-I-Hate-the-Bill-AP-PhotoJ.-Scott-Applewhite.jpg", "title": "House Fails To Override Obama Veto of Obamacare Repeal and Planned Parenthood Defund - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "GOP Leadership, House Leadership, Omnibus spending, Planned Parenthood, Planned Parenthood funding, Pro-Life Movement,Abortion, Big Government, Obamacare,veto", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Abortion", "tag": "Pro-Life Movement", "published_time": "2016-02-03T12:39:50-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Abortion,Obamacare"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Now, however, we have a new year and Planned Parenthood is once again funded, and Obamacare is still rolling along.\nEvangelical leader Franklin Graham left the Republican Party after GOP leaders included Planned Parenthood funding in the omnibus spending bill.\n\u201cSeeing and hearing Planned Parenthood talk nonchalantly about selling baby parts from aborted fetuses with utter disregard for human life is reminiscent of Joseph Mengele and the Nazi concentration camps!\nSome national pro-life leaders are declaring the override veto attempt to be a precedent-setting event \u2013 a Planned Parenthood defunding bill finally making it to the president\u2019s desk.\nThe new conservative media would then have stood behind Republican leaders in Congress for upholding their constitutional duty by refusing to fund a potentially criminal enterprise like Planned Parenthood."}
