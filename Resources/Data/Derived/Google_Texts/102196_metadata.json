They hope the \u201cGarfield Tiny House\u201d experiment will become a trend as it has elsewhere in the country.\n\nThat could provide the Pittsburgh neighborhood with affordable housing while filling some of its 300 vacant lots.\n\nIt won't be an easy sell if the next tiny house runs into the same hurdles as Pittsburgh's first.\n\n\u201cI don't think we're going to make anything on the house,\u201d Picker said. \u201cI'll probably lose money on it.\u201d\n\nPicker, who was the developer and general contractor, will sell it for $109,500, about $80,500 less than the cost. She's relying on subsidies. She said 14 people have expressed interest, including a woman who is seriously considering buying. Picker declined to identify her.\n\nSubsidies include a $49,000 grant from the city's Urban Redevelopment Authority, a $27,500 grant from nonprofit Bloomfield-Garfield Corp., an $11,000 grant from nonprofit Neighborhood Allies, and a $4,500 donation of kitchen and bathroom appliances from furniture chain Ikea.\n\n\u201cWe think it's a good investment because it can demonstrate the feasibility of that housing product and it can draw attention to communities like Garfield,\u201d said Kevin Acklin, who chairs the URA and is Mayor Bill Peduto's chief of staff.\n\nURA board member Jim Ferlo, a former state senator, said he had reservations in approving the grant.\n\n\u201cFor (nearly) $200,000, we should be able to build a family home,\u201d he said.\n\nThe structure, a little less than 350 square feet, is almost finished and includes a kitchen, bathroom and combination bedroom-living space with a trellised front porch. It has a full basement accessible through a trap door and ladder. An open house, originally set for mid-January, has been rescheduled for 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Jan. 31.\n\nCosts escalated from the original $100,000 projection because workers had to remove an old foundation left behind when the city demolished a house on the lot. A city requirement to have storm and sanitary sewers, and zoning variances, further hiked the price.\n\n\u201cThis was a learning experience for everybody,\u201d said Rick Swartz, executive director of Bloomfiend-Garfield Corp. \u201cWe're experimenting here with some new prototypes for in-fill housing. A tiny house could be the answer for a lot of the smaller vacant lots that we have in the neighborhood.\u201d\n\nTiny houses are popping up across the country as young and older buyers seek alternatives to hefty mortgages and energy-guzzling McMansions. Entire neighborhoods of tiny homes have emerged in Portland and Seattle, and owners created a community of tiny houses on wheels in Washington.\n\nIndustry experts say it's hard to gauge the trend. The National Association of Realtors found in a survey that the share of homebuyers choosing houses of less than 1,000 square feet has stayed at about 1 percent for the past five years.\n\nHilary Lentz, 27, of Baldwin Borough said she'd move into a tiny house on wheels immediately if she and her husband could find a safe and legal place to park it. The Lentzes tried out tiny house living during a weekend trip to New Hampshire where a company rents them for $99 a night.\n\n\u201cIt honestly wasn't a very cramped feeling,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reason why, I think, is it had very high ceilings. It's definitely not for everyone.\u201d\n\nBut the mobility and freedom from maintaining and paying for their 1,200 square foot home in Baldwin is appealing.\n\n\u201cWe both decided that it was definitely something that we'd like to do,\u201d Lentz said.\n\nPicker and Swartz are working on plans for more tiny houses on Hillcrest Street in Garfield with the hope of using what they learned on North Atlantic Avenue to avoid pitfalls. Swartz said whatever they come up with would probably require some subsidy from the city.\n\n\u201cWe're exploring other ways to give Garfield a better economic development future,\u201d Picker said.\n\nBob Bauder is a Trib Total Media staff writer.
