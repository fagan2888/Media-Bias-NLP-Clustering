Jim McGreevey.\n\nEugene McKnight, 64, who managed Ward F City Councilwoman Diane Coleman\u2019s campaign, joined JCETP last month and earns a $75,000 salary working with ex-offenders as part of the nonprofit\u2019s prisoner reentry program.\n\nMcGreevey defended the move, saying McKnight is uniquely qualified to help the nonprofit set up the program \u2014 which McGreevey and Mayor Steve Fulop hope will be a model for the nation.\n\n\u201cThere are thousands of people coming back home from incarceration every year into Jersey City,\u201d McGreevey said. \u201cHere was a man who had done wrong, had served his time and wanted to give back, and to explicitly work with ex-offenders.\u201d\n\nHe added that McKnight was a \u201ctremendous acquisition.\u201d\n\nFulop recruited McGreevey last July to run JCETP.\n\nMcKnight could not be reached for comment.\n\nIn the 1980s, McKnight, then the director of the city\u2019s Human Resources Department, masterminded a scheme in which he approved rental assistance and welfare checks for friends and employees, who then cashed them and split the money with McKnight.\n\nThe scheme, which went on for four years, inflated Jersey City\u2019s welfare rolls by 1,500 participants while McKnight and others walked away with $4.2 million, officials said at the time.\n\nIn 1992, McKnight pleaded guilty to racketeering and tampering with evidence in what was considered one of the state\u2019s largest public corruption conspiracies ever. Twenty-two other individuals were charged alongside McKnight, who was sentenced to nine years behind bars and ordered to pay $76,000 in restitution and a $5,000 fine.\n\nAccording to state Department of Corrections records, McKnight served about 18 months in prison and was released on parole in May 1994; he went missing from parole in November 1996 and was sent back to prison in February 1999 on a parole violation. He was released from prison in August 2000, according to the DOC.\n\nMcKnight helped engineer Coleman\u2019s initial 2012 election to the City Council, when she became the fifth vote that allowed Fulop, then a Ward E councilman, to take control of the nine-member body.\n\nAsked to comment, city spokeswoman Jennifer Morrill said McKnight\u2019s hiring is not \u201cpolitical,\u201d adding that Fulop has no say in JCETP\u2019s personnel moves. JCETP is a nonprofit that operates with public dollars.\n\nMinutes after Coleman declined to comment. Roger Jones, who chairs JCETP\u2019s board of directors, phoned The Jersey Journal and said Coleman did not pressure JCETP to hire McKnight.\n\nMcGreevey said JCETP plans to hire more ex-offenders, and \u201cthat\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also have to walk the same walk that we ask private businesses to do, which is giving people a second-chance opportunity,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "jersey-city", "title": "Jersey City man guilty in $4.5M city welfare scheme lands spot at jobs program", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Jersey City man guilty in $4.5M city welfare scheme lands spot at jobs program\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/02/former_gov_mcgreevey_defends_s.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/hudsoncountynow_impact/photo/14262825-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12207140\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-15T08:05:24Z\", \"author\": \"Terrence T.
