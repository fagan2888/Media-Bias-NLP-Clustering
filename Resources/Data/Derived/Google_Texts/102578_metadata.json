Mike Quigley (D-Ill.),(D-Va.), Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and(R-Texas).\n\nThose sponsors and other lawmakers have been unsuccessfully pushing legislation for years that would permit \"television coverage\" of the Supreme Court. A host of news organizations and transparency advocates have also called for the Supreme Court to open itself up to cameras, to no avail.\n\nThe new, four-page bill, however, would apply to the Supreme Court and all 13 appeals courts. It would also explicitly authorize a host of recordings, including live streams and broadcasts.\n\nLike previous bills, the legislation would provide exemptions if the recording \"would violate the due process rights\" of a party or if it is \"otherwise not in the interest of justice.\"\n\nThe lawmakers are slated to unveil their legislation during a rally outside the Supreme Court just as its new session begins.\n\nThe Supreme Court has been resistant to introducing cameras into its oral arguments, predicting it could change the way lawyers and judges interact. But Justice Stephen Breyer said it will eventually happen.\n\nThe appeals courts, on the other hand, have been able to make their own individual rules on the use of cameras in the court since 1996. For example, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals provides live audio streams of all of its proceedings and makes video recordings available. The Second Circuit has also developed rules to allow camera coverage with prior notification, but it is rarely used.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Lawmakers have been pushing the Supreme Court to allow cameras.", "description": "Lawmakers have been pushing the Supreme Court to allow cameras.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Mario Trujillo", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Lawmakers have been pushing the Supreme Court to allow cameras.", "title": "House members push new bill to open courts to livestreams", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/256228-house-members-push-new-bill-to-open-courts-to-livestreams", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/supremecourt_062515gn1-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-01T06:17-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/256228-house-members-push-new-bill-to-open-courts-to-livestreams", "dcterms.date": "2015-10-07T13:56-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Mario Trujillo", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "cameras in the court, Supreme Court, appeals court, Streaming,Gerry Connolly, Ted Poe,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-07T13:56:26-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-01T06:17:42-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/256228-house-members-push-new-bill-to-open-courts-to-livestreams", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Lawmakers have been pushing the Supreme Court to allow cameras.", "card": "summary", "title": "House members push new bill to open courts to livestreams"}, "dcterms.title": "House members push new bill to open courts to livestreams"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaa01\"", "article_summary": "Four bipartisan House members plan to introduce a new bill to require the Supreme Court and all other appeals courts to allow video recording and live streams of their proceedings.\nThe new, four-page bill, however, would apply to the Supreme Court and all 13 appeals courts.\nThose sponsors and other lawmakers have been unsuccessfully pushing legislation for years that would permit \"television coverage\" of the Supreme Court.\nA host of news organizations and transparency advocates have also called for the Supreme Court to open itself up to cameras, to no avail.\nIt would also explicitly authorize a host of recordings, including live streams and broadcasts."}
