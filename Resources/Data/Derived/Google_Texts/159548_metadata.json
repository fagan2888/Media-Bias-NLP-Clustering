Hiscox Holdings Inc led the round with participation from other investors that included Insure.VC and CCCC Growth Fund. In addition to the funding, Ben Walter, CEO of Hiscox U.S., is joining LevelFunded Health\u2019s board.\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nMIAMI (November 10, 2015) \u2013 LevelFunded Health, an innovative health insurance agency offering small business-focused benefit alternatives to the Affordable Care Act, announced today it has secured a second round of Venture Capital with Hiscox Holdings Inc. (London Stock Exchange: HSX). Hiscox, an international specialty insurer backed by Chicago-based Hiscox Insurance Company, Inc., led the private equity round and also receives a minority equity stake in LevelFunded Health through the deal.\n\nLevelFunded Health has emerged as an alternative to \u2018Obamacare\u2019 for small businesses with concerns over rising health insurance premiums as it can potentially save 10 to 40 percent annually, plus provide an opportunity for annual refunds on their health benefit expense. Founded in 2014, LevelFunded Health is rapidly growing its national client base given its expertise and focus on these ACA alternatives.\n\n\u201cHiscox boasts over 100,000 small business customers on the property and casualty side of commercial insurance, therefore, a joint-venture seemed to make great business sense given our mutual interests in serving the broader small business market segment,\u201d said Russ Carpel, CEO of LevelFunded Health. \u201cNot only is LevelFunded Health fortunate enough to have Hiscox as a capital partner, but Hiscox and LevelFunded Health will have a great opportunity to cross promote products and services to one another\u2019s client base.\u201d\n\nAs part of the deal, Ben Walter, CEO of Hiscox U.S. is receiving seat on the company\u2019s board, which helps provide strategic guidance as the company continues to scale. In addition to Hiscox, other investors in the round include Insure.VC (a prominent insurance venture capital fund) along with CCCC Growth Fund (a California-based private equity fund) of whom the latter also participated in the company\u2019s initial seed financing.\n\nLevelFunded benefit programs appear like hybrids between traditional small group health plans and concepts typically reserved for large corporations, known as \u2018self-insurance\u201d. There\u2019s a stark difference between the traditional definition of self-funding and level-funding. Small businesses with five or more employees can cover employees on their own with the added security blanket of a stop loss policy from an A-rated insurance carrier that handles the plan\u2019s administration and excess risk above a certain limit. Businesses simply set aside the cash to cover anticipated claim expenses. The monthly premium remains the same (level) during the whole year and if claims are less than the funded amount, a rebate or credit is issued at the end of the year. If claims go over the funded amount, businesses are protected by a stop-loss policy.\n\n\u201cThis part of the insurance market is just beginning to emerge and can really make a big difference to small businesses,\u201d added Carpel. \u201cFor the past 18-24 months, small businesses have seen their traditional small group health insurance premiums rise by as much as 10-200 percent, and that\u2019s a huge dent to the bottom line.\u201d\n\nSmall businesses with fairly healthy populations with five or more employees are eligible for coverage in most states, and additional benefits include no penalties or taxation, and no more navigating state SHOP exchanges.\n\nAbout Level Funded Health\n\nLevelFunded Health Partners, LLC is an innovative, national health insurance agency with a hyper-focus on Affordable Care Act \u201calternative\u201d employee benefit programs for the small employer market segment.
