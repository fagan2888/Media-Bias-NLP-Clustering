The American public has a bigger problem\u2014and that problem is largely based in Washington.\n\nFollowing a year of low approval ratings for members of Congress and the President, it\u2019s no surprise that more Americans say the government is the biggest problem facing the country.\n\nA new Gallup poll out on Wednesday shows that 21 percent of people ranked the government as their primary concern ahead of the usual top contenders \u2013 the economy, which received 18 percent, and the unemployment rate, which received 16 percent. The negative response to government question included, \u201cDissatisfaction with government/Congress/politicians; poor leadership/corruption/abuse of power.\u201d\n\nRelated: 15 Awful Things More Popular Than Congress\n\nThe concern and dissatisfaction with the federal government has topped the list since last October, when political infighting over the funding of the president\u2019s health care law forced a 16-day government shutdown that halted federal programs and temporarily put hundreds of thousands of people out of work. The number has since fallen back to its January 2013 level, driven mostly by Republicans (26 percent), Independents (23 percent) and least of all, Democrats (18 percent).\n\nUnsurprisingly, congressional approval ratings have suffered as well. They fell to a record low of 9 percent in the wake of the shutdown and ended the year at a measly 13 percent. Lawmakers also earned the title of least productive Congress in history, passing a mere 60 bills.\n\nFor its part, Congress did manage to pass a bipartisan budget deal in December and is about to narrowly avoid another government shutdown this month.\n\nThe disappointment isn\u2019t just with Congress, either. President Obama is also suffering from dismal approval ratings that have hovered in the low 40s, likely explained by the botched rollout of his signature health care law. One month into the Obamacare launch, the president\u2019s approval rating fell to 39 percent \u2013 the lowest of his presidency, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Dismal Approval Ratings Take Another Dive\n\nHealth care also ranks as a major concern among the public. About 16 percent of those polled listed it as their top issue of this year, compared to only 4 percent last year. That increase can likely be explained by the troubled rollout of Obamacare as well as the President\u2019s broken promise about keeping your health plan if you like it.\n\nThe poll is also revealing about attitudes toward the national debt. As an issue, it began last year near the top of the list, with roughly 20 percent of people listing it as the nation\u2019s biggest problem. It\u2019s now near the bottom of the public\u2019s concerns, at just 8 percent.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Move over, economy.", "title": "Top Problem for Americans Now\u2014The U.S. Government", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/15/Top-Problem-Americans-Now-US-Government", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04172013_republican_democrat_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/15/Top-Problem-Americans-Now-US-Government", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04172013_republican_democrat_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Move over, economy.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f90\"", "article_summary": "Following a year of low approval ratings for members of Congress and the President, it\u2019s no surprise that more Americans say the government is the biggest problem facing the country.\nOne month into the Obamacare launch, the president\u2019s approval rating fell to 39 percent \u2013 the lowest of his presidency, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.\nUnsurprisingly, congressional approval ratings have suffered as well.\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Dismal Approval Ratings Take Another DiveHealth care also ranks as a major concern among the public.\nThe American public has a bigger problem\u2014and that problem is largely based in Washington."}
