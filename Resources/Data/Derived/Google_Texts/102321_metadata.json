The group says the ad campaign will be a multimillion-dollar buy and will run both nationally and in selected local markets.\n\nThe ads will argue that the nuclear deal negotiated between six countries and Iran will ultimately make the world less safe. The group\u2019s first ad campaign emphasizes that Iran is able to keep its nuclear sites, has long violated international agreements and highlights its support for international terrorism.\n\n\u201cOur audience is bipartisan, but Democrats should be especially concerned because the deal increase the chances of war, will spur a nuclear arms race and reward an Iran with a horrific human rights record,\u201d said Patrick Dorton, a spokesman for Citizens For A Nuclear Free Iran.\n\nAIPAC, along with other independent donors will provide financial commitments to the new group \u2014 which by law does not have to reveal the sources of its funding.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has made the case that the alternative to the nuclear deal \u2014 which eases economic sanctions in exchange for sharply curtailing Iran\u2019s nuclear activities \u2014 is a military conflict or the status quo. Critics believe that the deal could spark an arms race and further destabilize the region.\n\nCongress has less than two months to review the deal and pass legislation that would unwind it. Mr. Obama has vowed to veto such an effort, setting up a showdown in Congress over the implementation of the accord. Mr. Obama will need to keep Democratic support to sustain his veto, which would require a two-thirds vote from each house of Congress to override.\n\nCitizens For A Nuclear Free Iran has enlisted several high profile Democrats in its efforts, including former Sens. Mary Landrieu, Mark Begich, Evan Bayh and Joe Lieberman. All will serve on the group\u2019s advisory committee.\n\nThe advocacy group J Street \u2014 which describes itself as both pro-Israel and pro-peace \u2014 is launching a similar ad campaign in support of the deal.\n\n\u201cThis deal makes the United States, Israel and the entire world safer, and it would be highly irresponsible for Congress to reject it,\u201d said J Street President Jeremy Ben-Ami in a statement this week. \u201cJ Street wants Congress to know that, despite some loud opposition to the deal coming from Jewish organizational leaders, our polling suggests that a clear majority of Jewish Americans agrees with us and backs the deal.\u201d\n\nThe dueling ad campaigns are both expected to be multimillion dollar efforts, though neither group would give an exact figure.\n\nMore\n\nSenate Democrats Key to Iran Deal\n\nThe Physicist Answering Lawmakers\u2019 Questions on Deal", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, is putting its financial muscle behind a new advertising campaign in opposition to a nuclear accord with Iran.", "title": "AIPAC Funds Ads Opposing Iran Nuclear Deal", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/07/17/aipac-funds-ads-opposing-iran-nuclear-deal/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JL301_aipac_E_20150717150907.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "AIPAC Funds Ads Opposing Iran Nuclear Deal", "description": "The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, is putting its financial muscle behind a new advertising campaign in opposition to a nuclear accord with Iran.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Byron Tau", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, is putting its financial muscle behind a new advertising campaign in opposition to a nuclear accord with Iran.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-07-17T19:12:08-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/07/17/aipac-funds-ads-opposing-iran-nuclear-deal/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-56732", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, is putting its financial muscle behind a new advertising campaign in opposition to a nuclear accord with Iran.", "title": "AIPAC Funds Ads Opposing Iran Nuclear Deal", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/07/17/aipac-funds-ads-opposing-iran-nuclear-deal/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-56732", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-07-17T19:15:05-04:00"}, "article_summary": "The ads will argue that the nuclear deal negotiated between six countries and Iran will ultimately make the world less safe.\nThe group says the ad campaign will be a multimillion-dollar buy and will run both nationally and in selected local markets.\nThe pro-Israel lobbying group will throw its weight behind Citizens For A Nuclear Free Iran, a new 501(c)4 nonprofit that will begin airing an ad campaign this week.\nCitizens For A Nuclear Free Iran has enlisted several high profile Democrats in its efforts, including former Sens.\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, is putting its financial muscle behind a new advertising campaign in opposition to a nuclear accord with Iran."}
