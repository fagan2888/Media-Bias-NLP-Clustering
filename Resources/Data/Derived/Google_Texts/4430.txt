RUSH: We went back and put together a montage starting in March of 2009 through May of last year of Obama. This is the Limbaugh Theorem on display here. This is Obama's "I'm madder than you are." This is Obama when he first learns about these things and how he does it, how he treats it, how he reacts to it, and how mad he is.

OBAMA MAY 15, 2013: It's inexcusable, and Americans are right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it.

OBAMA OCTOBER 21, 2013: Nobody's madder than me about the fact that the website isn't workin'.

OBAMA OCTOBER 18, 2011: It's very upsetting to me that somebody showed such bad judgment, that they would allow something like that to happen.

OBAMA APRIL 15, 2012: If it turns out some of the allegations that have been made in the press are confirmed, then of course I'll be angry.

OBAMA MAY 13, 2013: I've got no patience with it, I will not tolerate it, and we'll make sure that, uh, we find out exactly what happened.

OBAMA JUNE 3, 2010: I am furious at this entire situation. I would love to just spend a lot of my time venting and yellin' at people.

OBAMA MAY 15, 2013: We're going to hold the responsible parties accountable.

OBAMA MAY 16, 2013: The minute I found out about it, then my main focus is making sure that we get the thing fixed.

OBAMA MARCH 18, 2009: I think people are right to be angry. I'm angry!

RUSH: Every one of those is about a separate issue, and I will tell you which issue he was reacting to after this.

BREAK TRANSCRIPT

RUSH: All right. I want to replay for you the montage where you heard Obama talking about how mad he was and he's gonna get to the bottom of it. I mentioned to you that not one was repeated; they're all different things. Some are the same issues twice, but they're all different statements. Let's start again.

The first one is May 15th of last year talking about the IRS scandal and the Tea Party.

OBAMA MAY 15, 2013: It's inexcusable, and Americans are right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it.

RUSH: Stop the tape. Next one, this is the Obamacare rollout fiasco, October 21, 2013.

OBAMA OCTOBER 21, 2013: Nobody's madder than me about the fact that the website isn't workin'.

RUSH: Up next, Fast and Furious, October 18, 2011.

OBAMA OCTOBER 18, 2011: It's very upsetting to me that somebody showed such bad judgment, that they would allow something like that to happen.

RUSH: Up next, Secret Service scandal, drunk on the job, partying and so forth. April 15, 2012.

OBAMA APRIL 15, 2012: If it turns out some of the allegations that have been made in the press are confirmed, then of course I'll be angry.

RUSH: He really mad. IRS targeting scandal, May 13, 2013.

OBAMA MAY 13, 2013: I've got no patience with it, I will not tolerate it, and we'll make sure that, uh, we find out exactly what happened.

RUSH: The Gulf oil spill, BP, June 3, 2010.

OBAMA JUNE 3, 2010: I am furious at this entire situation. I would love to just spend a lot of my time venting and yellin' at people.

RUSH: IRS targeting scandal again. This is May 15, 2013.

OBAMA MAY 15, 2013: We're going to hold the responsible parties accountable.

RUSH: And there is a couple more. One is the IRS scandal again. The final one was bonuses on Wall Street in 2009. So, you see, this is the pattern. He's mad. Every one of these scandals, he never knew they were happening -- and when he found out, boy, was he mad!

BREAK TRANSCRIPT

RUSH: We have the final two items in our montage. And again this is March of 2009 through May of 2013. The next to last one in our montage is from May 16th of 2013, the president really outraged when he learned even more about how the IRS was targeting the Tea Party.

OBAMA MAY 16, 2013: The minute I found out about it, then my main focus is making sure that we get the thing fixed.

RUSH: The minute he found out about it. Now, remember, it was just a couple of rogue agents in the Cincinnati office. He found out about that and he was livid. Now, you remember at the time that scandal was going on, people were looking for the smoking-gun memo from the White House to IRS to try to connect it. I presciently told you there would not be a smoking-gun memo or any other kind of memo because a memo wasn't necessary. The people at the IRS are there, put there by Obama agents, meaning fellow travelers in the administration, because they know who they are, they know what they're gonna do, they know what their proclivities are. They don't need instruction.

In other words, they don't need to be told, "The Tea Party is a problem. We gotta make sure they are impeded in fundraising. We've gotta put up obstacles." They don't have to tell 'em that. Lois Lerner is in her own right a mad, partisan liberal who, if she gets the idea that the climate's right, she'll act on her own. If she thinks that no harm will come to her, if she thinks that she's impressing the boss, if she thinks she can get away with it, she'll follow her natural inclinations.

Van Jones, same thing. I remember when he was outed as a communist sympathizer, people said, "Gee, how did he get past Obama? I wonder if Obama knew." No, no. That's not how it works. Van Jones was chosen precisely because of the way he is and precisely because he didn't need direction. None of these people do. They're just as committed ideologically as Obama is. All they need is to know that there aren't any obstacles in their way. All they need to know is that if the worst thing happens and they are discovered, that this is gonna be the result, that Obama's gonna feign ignorance. He's gonna act like he had no idea it was going on. He's livid as he can be, and he's gonna look into it.

And nothing else happens because the mission, as far as the president's concerned, is simply let the low-information crowd know he's outraged like everybody else is. He's gonna get to the bottom of it. He's gonna find out what happened, and that's it; that's enough. There doesn't need to be any follow-up on whatever investigation. There doesn't need to be presidential action dealing with whatever was learned, because reality is not the point. Image, PR, buzz, packaging, all that is the point.

The image that Obama's mad and is really offended and he was not told that people hoodwinked him and they're taking advantage of him and he's gonna get to the bottom of it, that's it, that's all that needs to happen. And then it is confirmed that he's got good intentions, and he really cares, and he's really upset about this, like you are.

You're not supposed to say, "Well, wait a minute now, you're the CEO. I mean, you're running this show. What do you mean, you don't know?" You're not supposed to ask, "I mean, you ran on these issues. You ran on all this stuff." You're not supposed to go there and ask that. His media doesn't. So it's left to people like us to talk about this and we never know what kind of impact it makes on people.

This montage, I got a note from a friend that said it ought to be on every cable news network and network evening newscast tonight. But it won't be. Our montage, our little montage, just exposes the phoniness, the contrived anger, the made-up outrage about all of this. It exposes it. There's a pattern here and how it all works. We have one left. This is March the 18th, 2009. This is Obama really, really mad about all those bonuses at AIG and other firms on Wall Street.

OBAMA MARCH 18, 2009: I think people are right to be angry. I'm angry.

RUSH: Yeah! See? (imitating Obama) "People have a right to be mad. I'm mad, too. I'm gonna investigate, get to bottom of it." Washington Post: "This memo shows that the VA knew of records manipulation in 2010." What's noteworthy about that? Well, 2010 was the second year of the Obama administration. Now, let me tackle a question that I haven't got yet but I'm sure when I check the e-mail during the break I'm gonna get it, "Rush, why are you making a big deal out of this? This has not mattered anymore. People don't look at Obama the same way they do other presidents, so he's not gonna be hurt by this. Why are you focusing on this? Why are you making a big deal out of this?"

Believe me, I ask myself the same the question. But we don't know that it isn't having an impact on people. I mean, I clearly know that people like you in this audience, it affects you, you're angered by it, and it helps to expose Obama for who he really is, and it exposes a tactic or a technique. Who knows what impact any of this kind of exposure or exposing of this kind of behavior has on low-information people. You never know. But it'd be irresponsible not to point this stuff out.

And here's another question I'm gonna get. "Rush, the president can't know everything that goes on. He can't know everything. He's got rogue employees at the IRS doing things. He's got this VA thing. He can't possibly know. Why are you holding him accountable?" Because everything that is happening can be linked ideologically to who Obama is, particularly Obamacare, the VA. But you know the big umbrella thing under which all of this falls is that government is incompetent.

Giant bureaucracies cannot do these things. They're not filled with qualified people. They're not filled with experienced people. They're not populated by accomplished people. The lesson of government is that it can't do these things. And the evidence is repeating in the Obama administration. Over and over again we learn that Obama nor any of his people high up in whatever bureaucracy can accomplish any of these things. They can't do a website. They can't roll out Obamacare. They can't improve health care. They can't run the VA. They can't run the IRS honestly. They turn as much of it as they can into a political weapon furthering the agenda of the president.

That's why it matters, because the people of this country at some point are gonna have to realize that relying on government to fix everything is foolhardy. It's government that's breaking many of these things. But the left has done a very admirably good job of demonizing the private sector, where what happens? Cheating, lying, dishonesty, destroying the planet, killing customers, starving people. And they've positioned themselves, of course, as the great compassionate last hope. They're the ones who truly care.

We're not supposed to examine the results of their efforts, which are always dismal and always fail. We're supposed to examine their good intentions. "At least they're trying. People like you, Limbaugh, you just run people down every day. Well, anybody can do that. At least Obama cares. At least he's trying. I heard him. He was really mad over this VA thing." Why don't you ask yourself how in the world, after five or six years, do all of these things, from the economy to health care to the VA to the IRS, you name it, get worse? At some point, at some point people -- and I think it's happening -- are gonna have to realize, this is not accidental.

The economy and its dismal status is the result of policy decisions that Obama has made and put into place. It's not the quirk of fate. It's not that America's best days are over. It's not that America's past was a fad or a quirk. It's not that the great economic days of the eighties were illegitimate or unreal. It's not that this is the new normal. It's not that all of the greatness in the past was undeserved. It is precisely because of Obama policies implemented since 2009 that this country is in the shape it's in. It is the result of policy, legislation, if you will, executive orders, things Obama has done because he wanted to do them.

What is the number I saw yesterday? The record number of people on disability. (interruption) The population of Greece. But every metric or measurement in our economy is worsening, and it's the result of policy. And so is what's happening at the VA. Everything about this scandal is the result of Obama administration policy, and that's why it is a flat-out, insulting joke when the president goes on TV and acts shocked and surprised that he didn't know this was going on and that now that he does, he's gonna get to the bottom of it, after an investigation, 'cause he's just as mad as you are. That is fatuous. That is sophistry.

The fact of the matter is that what's going on at the VA is because of policy. It's because of things Obama and his administration have done, purposefully. Ditto Obamacare and health care. Ditto the economy and the unemployed. Ditto everything. And there isn't anything good. The Democrats are not seeking reelection on anything good. And everything bad that's happening is the result of Democrats having won elections and implementing their beliefs. It's not fate. It's not by accident. It's not coincidence. It's not the result of cosmic forces working against us. It is because specifically of policies, legislation, ideas, whatever you want to call it, implemented, put into action by this administration.

And that's why we all try to point out the phoniness of the president acting mad and ignorant and outraged as though he doesn't know any of this is happening and he doesn't know why it's happening, and he's gonna get to the bottom of it. He knows exactly why it's happening. He put it all into play.

BREAK TRANSCRIPT

RUSH: We've added to the montage. We've added today's Obama outrage over what he learned just today from Eric Shinseki about what's been going on -- what's allegedly going on -- at the VA. He just found out about it today, so we've added today's outrage to the montage. Here it is again, starting March of 2009.

OBAMA MAY 15, 2013: It's inexcusable, and Americans are right to be angry about it, and I am angry about it.

OBAMA OCTOBER 21, 2013: Nobody's madder than me about the fact that the website isn't workin'.

OBAMA OCTOBER 18, 2011: It's very upsetting to me that somebody showed such bad judgment, that they would allow something like that to happen.

OBAMA APRIL 15, 2012: If it turns out some of the allegations that have been made in the press are confirmed, then of course I'll be angry.

OBAMA MAY 13, 2013: I've got no patience with it, I will not tolerate it, and we'll make sure that, uh, we find out exactly what happened.

OBAMA JUNE 3, 2010: I am furious at this entire situation. I would love to just spend a lot of my time venting and yellin' at people.

OBAMA MAY 15, 2013: We're going to hold the responsible parties accountable.

OBAMA MAY 16, 2013: The minute I found out about it, then my main focus is making sure that we get the thing fixed.

OBAMA MARCH 18, 2009: I think people are right to be angry. I'm angry!

OBAMA MAY 21, 2014: I will not stand for it, not as commander-in-chief ... None of us should. [I]t's dishonorable, it is disgraceful, and I will not tolerate it. Period.

RUSH: So that last one is today's outrage over the VA -- which he didn't know anything about until today when he talked to Eric Shinseki -- and he didn't know about any of these other things. But again, he knew about them all. They are all the result of Obama policy. They're all the result of things Obama has done, plain and simple.
