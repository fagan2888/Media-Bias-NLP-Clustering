Fox News’ Eric Bolling ended his Saturday morning Cashin’ In show this week by exposing what he believes to be a “giant hoax perpetrated on the American people” after video emerged of Obamacare “architect” Jonathan Gruber discussing the “stupidity of the American people” as being helpful to passing the law.

In Bolling’s assessment, Gruber and his cohorts knew Americans would never approve of a healthcare mandate so “they lied — or let’s say they ‘Grubered’ their way into getting Obamacare passed.” He added, “No surprise here, they’re Democrats, that’s what they do.”

Bolling then turned to one of his favorite targets, The Daily Show’s Jon Stewart, who has spent a good amount of time calling out Fox News’ “bullshit” about Obamacare.

The real “bullcrap,” according to Bolling, has come from people like Gruber and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. “You want bullcrap?” he asked. “It’s you Jon Stewart, liberal Democrats, the White House and the mainstream media. You are all purveyors of bullcrap in epic proportions.”

“How about you man up Stewart and admit you were ‘Grubered’ into selling that Obamacare bullcrap,” Bolling concluded. If Fox is “Bullshit Mountain,” then Bolling has renamed The Daily Show “Grand Bullcrap Canyon.”
