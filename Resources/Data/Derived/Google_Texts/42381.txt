A woman who the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office reported as potentially kidnapped has been found unharmed.

Mia Hamilton, 30, was found shortly after 1 a.m. Saturday during a traffic stop in Loveland, according to a sheriff’s office news release.

A man in the car, who has not been identified, was taken into custody for allegations of second-degree kidnapping and robbery, the release said.

Officials received a call from the Budget Host Motel on Frontage Road around 6:34 a.m. Friday. The caller reported the possible kidnapping of 30-year-old Mia Hamilton.

The caller told officials three men pulled Hamilton into a 1980s-1990s era Chrysler minivan and drove north on the east Frontage Road of Interstate 25 toward Colorado 402.

The investigation into the incident remains ongoing.
