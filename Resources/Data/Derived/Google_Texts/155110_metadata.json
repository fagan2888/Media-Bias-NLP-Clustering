Weerachon Sukondhapatipak, the deputy spokesman of Thailand's Army, which seized power in a May coup.\n\nThai authorities have been criticized for what has been seen as a shambolic investigation into the murders, including a slew of false leads and concerns over lapses in investigative procedure.\n\nPolice now allege that two workers from neighboring Myanmar, Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21, committed the murders.\n\nPolice have said they have obtained confessions as well as DNA evidence from Witheridge that matches both men, although concerns have been raised over the validity of the evidence.\n\nThe men have been charged with murder, rape and robbery.\n\n(Reporting By Viparat Jantraprap and Aubrey Belford; additional reporting by Costas Pitas in London; editing by Rosalind
