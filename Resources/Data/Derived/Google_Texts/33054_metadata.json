Grinaldi, who references that coding sometimes in her work for an insurance company, believes she is a victim.\n\nAfter contacting several people for months at UnityPoint Health and getting no response, she contacted the Iowa Attorney General\u2019s Office, Iowa's Insurance Division, Sen. Chuck Grassley\u2019s Office and the Reader\u2019s Watchdog.\n\nUnityPoint is now reviewing the matter.\n\nHere\u2019s what Grinaldi says happened:\n\nGrinaldi made an appointment at UnityPoint Health last March in West Des Moines after she recognized that the pain and other symptoms she was experiencing were likely caused by a kidney stone.\n\nShe weighed in and had her blood pressure taken at the clinic. But since she arrived late on a Friday afternoon, she says nurse practitioner Tiffany Matheny advised her to go directly to an emergency room.\n\nThe talk with Matheny lasted around 5 minutes, Grinaldi said.\n\nThe charge on the bill from UnityPoint: $265.\n\nBaffled, Grinaldi obtained an itemized bill to look into the \u201cCPT\u201d code applied for her visit. Current Procedural Terminology codes are numbers assigned to every task and service a medical practitioner provides to determine the reimbursement from insurers, Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nSince everyone uses the same codes, they are supposed to ensure uniformity.\n\nBut the code UnityPoint applied to Grinaldi\u2019s short stop at the clinic was 99215. In the medical world, that code is used for a doctor evaluation that typically lasts around 40 minutes.\n\nBy definition, a health care provider would have needed to have done two of the following three things to apply that code correctly: Take a comprehensive medical history or perform a comprehensive examination; make a medical decision of \u201chigh complexity,\u201d or counsel or coordinate care with other providers.\n\nGrinaldi says none of that happened on her brief visit. Any medical history and notes existed before she stopped in.\n\nGrinaldi tried to reach out to the doctor\u2019s office, the billing office, the clinic administrator and the legal department. One time, she said, someone in the billing office offered her a 20 percent discount if she would pay up and go away.\n\nWhen she got no answers, she refused to pay her portion of the bill \u2014 $180 \u2014 and formally appealed the charge with UnityPoint four months ago. UnityPoint did not respond and referred her case to a collections agency.\n\nGrinaldi said another more appropriate CPT code for a quick appointment with no consultation with a doctor was never used. The code that was applied to her brief drop-in was the highest-paying one that could have been selected.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, they\u2019ve been so arrogant. They haven\u2019t even bothered to respond,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been months.\u201d\n\nI sent details of Grinald's concerns to Amy Varcoe, a spokeswoman for UnityPoint. I also sent Varcoe a release written and signed by Grinaldi giving permission for someone to explain what happened with the bill, as I have done in other Watchdog columns involving medical issues.\n\nVarcoe said the hand-written consent form was not considered \"valid written authorization\" and \"therefore, does not allow us to comment on her case.\"\n\nShe said the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) prohibited UnityPoint from commenting on any patient\u2019s treatment or bills.\n\n\"We have procedures in place to review concerns raised by patients about bills received related to care at our facilities,\" she wrote in a statement.\n\n\"A phone number is printed on every bill so any patient with a question or concern can call and speak with someone directly for assistance.\"\n\nI told Varcoe that didn't really explain what patients are supposed to do when they get no response about billing concerns from UnityPoint. I also asked her to send me an authorization form the the company would accept for future columns.\n\nBut Grinaldi did get results: She told me Thursday she got a call from Matt Romanin, UnityPoint's regional vice president for clinic operations. She said he was very polite and apologized at length for letting her down as a patient.\n\nRomanin said he would put a stop to the collections effort while UnityPoint looks into what happened with the coding on the bill.\n\n\"I told him it's too bad I had to go to this extent to get someone to listen to me,\" Grinaldi said.\n\nSatisfied for now, Grinaldi said she would let us know what happens.\n\nGet an itemized bill\n\nIf you obtain an itemized bill from your medical provider, you can review it to make sure procedures and services were actually provided.\n\nCPT codes, short for Current Procedural Terminology, will be listed for each. Each CPT code is given a value that is submitted to insurers for reimbursement. The values reflect Medicare payment amounts. If you have private insurance, the amount paid to the provider may be more or less, depending on negotiations.\n\nIf you don\u2019t feel that a code was applied correctly, you may appeal.\n\nGo here to see definitions of different CPT codes in Iowa: http://tinyurl.com/zv5xvsk\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1OxI060", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Cathi Grinaldi, a nurse familiar with health care billing, is fighting $265 bill for doctor's visit that never happened.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "Cathi Grinaldi, a nurse familiar with health care billing, is fighting $265 bill for doctor's visit that never happened.", "title": "Watchdog: Nurse says health system overbilled her", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2016/01/01/watchdog-nurse-says-unitypoint-overbilled-her/78035018/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cathi Grinaldi, a nurse familiar with health care billing, is fighting $265 bill for doctor's visit that never happened.", "title": "Watchdog: Nurse says health system overbilled her", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4a1327cbd3afe1445e34dbcaded3b7c30c739db8/c=0-60-479-539&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/29/IAGroup/DesMoines/635870043032735248-Grinaldi.JPG", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "LeeRood/ReadersWatchdog"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/UnityPoint Health", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/UnityPoint Health", "title": "Watchdog: Nurse says health system overbilled her", "author": "Lee Rood", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/investigations/readers-watchdog", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/169db025d3385028ceb479203248797f87b90ab3/c=0-0-480-640/local/-/media/2015/12/29/IAGroup/DesMoines/635870043032735248-Grinaldi.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b54de56fab0631a37dee8d7617994e0b997e1d47/c=0-60-479-539/local/-/media/2015/12/29/IAGroup/DesMoines/635870043032735248-Grinaldi.JPG", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8e7eab285109c451be30df7b3c610c6bb8d5e811/c=0-56-479-416/local/-/media/2015/12/29/IAGroup/DesMoines/635870043032735248-Grinaldi.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dd2c3bda837b8c4aa221acb5b62b96c17f8d1f74/c=0-53-479-324&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/12/29/IAGroup/DesMoines/635870043032735248-Grinaldi.JPG", "publishtime": "2016-01-01T18:06:58.647000-06:00", "shorthed": "Watchdog: Nurse says health system overbilled her", "articleid": 78035018, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/50c56251ead6e755476382ab96b8ca82d63c709e/c=0-53-479-324/local/-/media/2015/12/29/IAGroup/DesMoines/635870043032735248-Grinaldi.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e3b501251f0aab7e1ba6253a4f18aa90074dcc07/c=61-0-419-640/local/-/media/2015/12/29/IAGroup/DesMoines/635870043032735248-Grinaldi.JPG"}}}, "article_summary": "She said the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) prohibited UnityPoint from commenting on any patient\u2019s treatment or bills.\nGo here to see definitions of different CPT codes in Iowa: http://tinyurl.com/zv5xvskRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1OxI060\nEach CPT code is given a value that is submitted to insurers for reimbursement.\nBut the code UnityPoint applied to Grinaldi\u2019s short stop at the clinic was 99215.\nGrinaldi said another more appropriate CPT code for a quick appointment with no consultation with a doctor was never used."}
