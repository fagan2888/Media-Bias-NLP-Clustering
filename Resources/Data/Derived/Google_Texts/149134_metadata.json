The goals of the law were to increase access to health care, lower the overall cost of care, and improve consumer protections and the quality of medical care nationwide. Whether it has succeeded is a debate for another blog, but we can help you understand what\u2019s in the law and what it means for you.\n\nYou may be familiar with a few tenets of the law, such as the requirement that all legal residents have health insurance or pay a penalty, or that businesses employing 50 or more people provide health insurance for employees. However, the law is thousands of pages long and likely includes rules and protections you don\u2019t know about. Here\u2019s a primer.\n\nNew rules that affect health care consumers\n\nThe health care law includes so many rules that a complete list would be dizzying, but many consumers remain relatively unaffected. \u201cA lot of these provisions were already in place, not by law but by large employer plans\u201d that most people already had, says Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research.\u200b Examples include things like providing insurance plans for all employees and including free preventive care in plans.\n\nStill, some parts of the law, like a ban on pricing based on gender or pre-existing conditions, made big waves when introduced. Whether they represent big changes or small ones, these are the key provisions of the Affordable Care Act that affect consumers the most:\n\nThe individual mandate: With some exceptions, U.S. civilians must have health insurance that meets minimum requirements or else pay a tax penalty.\n\nInsurance plans are now grouped into four tiers \u2014 bronze, silver, gold and platinum \u2014 which determine pricing and generosity of coverage.\n\nInsurers must provide health plan information \u2014 including the tier, deductibles and coverage rules \u2014 to all consumers to help them comparison shop.\n\nConsumers can use an established process to appeal a health insurer\u2019s decisions on claims.\n\nInsurers must provide certain preventive services for free.\n\nInsurers are not allowed to deny coverage or set premium prices based on gender or pre-existing conditions.\n\nYoung adults are allowed to stay on their parents\u2019 health plans until age 26.\n\nBusinesses with 50 workers or more must offer health insurance to employees or pay a penalty.\n\nInsurers must spend 80% to 85% of premiums on health care services and innovations to improve quality of care, or give rebates to consumers.\n\nHospitals, doctors\u2019 offices and other medical care facilities must use electronic medical records, making it easier for doctors and patients to access records to improve quality of care.\n\nThese rules are now law. Other rules have yet to go into effect, including a \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on the most expensive employer health plans, delayed by Congress until 2018.\n\nThe Federal Marketplace and protections for marketplace consumers\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s health care law also established a way for consumers without employer health plans to purchase and afford coverage.\n\nStates were allowed to create online health insurance marketplaces for their residents. Consumers in states that did not create one use the Federal Marketplace to purchase coverage. People shopping on state or federal marketplaces are the only consumers who can qualify for tax breaks or subsidies if they meet income requirements.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act targeted people who didn\u2019t have insurance because it wasn\u2019t affordable and who had private insurance because they were self-employed, Kominski says. Despite a famously glitchy rollout in 2013, the marketplaces have helped 4.1 million people gain insurance to date, according to a Rand Corp. study. The law itself has resulted in 16.9 million newly insured, according to the same study, partly through Medicaid expansion.\n\nChanges to Medicare and Medicaid\n\nMany parts of the law are specific to those receiving Medicare or Medicaid benefits. Medicare is a federally sponsored health plan for seniors; people become eligible at age 65. Medicaid is similar, but for low-income people.\n\nOne major change is Medicaid expansion, which took effect in 31 states. Nineteen states opted out. One part of the expansion is that Medicaid beneficiaries formerly had to have a qualifying condition to get coverage, whereas now there are no conditions \u2014 just an income requirement, which has also changed.\n\n\u201cWhereas before, every state could set its own income threshold, now there\u2019s a single, uniform standard\u201d in those 31 states, Kominski says. The threshold is 133% of the poverty level, \u201cbut is closer to 138% because the Medicaid program allows you to have a 5% income offset,\u201d Kominski adds.\n\nChanges were made to Medicare to reduce medical costs for the elderly, and include:\n\nBy 2020, the Medicare doughnut hole must be closed, ensuring more affordable prescriptions for many seniors.\n\nMedicare is allowed to conceive of and implement new ways to charge for care, including bundling payments for costly knee and hip surgeries to reduce spending.\n\nMedicare can reduce payments to hospitals that have high readmission rates and find ways to pay hospitals based on quality of care and patient outcomes.\n\nMedicare can reimburse for personalized preventive care, based on each beneficiary\u2019s health needs, as outlined by a primary care physician.\n\nWhat it means for you\n\nWhew, that was a lot! But we\u2019re not done yet, because not everybody has to follow all those rules. For starters, businesses with fewer than 50 employees are exempt from having to provide health insurance to their workers. Some larger employers don\u2019t have to provide health plans that include contraception, which is one of the free preventive services provided to women, if the employers are opposed to birth control based on a religious view.\n\nAnd there are several exemptions from the individual mandate, the rule that everyone must have health insurance. They include incarceration and low income or financial hardship. For more on exemptions or to see if you qualify, check here.\n\nIf those exemptions don\u2019t apply to you, the main way the health care law affects your life is by requiring you to have insurance or else pay a tax penalty. It also likely requires your employer to provide health insurance you can afford, but if your employer is exempt you might be eligible for tax subsidies on the marketplace. Lastly, your coverage must meet certain minimum requirements, which is your insurer\u2019s responsibility. If you have all that, you\u2019re covered.\n\nLacie Glover is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website. Email: lacie@nerdwallet.com.
