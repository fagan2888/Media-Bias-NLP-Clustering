The overcast skies didn't deter many kids from coming out to the second annual Carter Foundation Spring Basketball Tournament.

The tournament taking place at Magnolia basketball courts Saturday afternoon.

16 teams, boys and girls, competing in the tournament with many onlookers cheering them on. The founder of this charity James Carter says events like this are all about bringing people together and giving the kids in Meridian something positive to do.

"The goal in having tournaments like this is to keep kids off the streets and create a safe environment for our children,” Carter explains. “We have 50 to 100 kids in a safe environment, then that's 50 to 100 kids that aren't out on the streets, having them in a safe place at the same time."
