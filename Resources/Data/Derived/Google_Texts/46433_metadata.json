Even with the limited content that it came with initially \u2014 the game started with just three maps and seven playable characters \u2014 its launch has been well-received.\n\nOne of the driving factors behind this success was recently explained by Tripwire Interactive VP Alan Wilson in an interview with GamesIndustry.biz.\n\n\u201cWe do not subscribe to the view that things that go into Early Access should be broken,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cYeah, there\u2019s probably going to be the odd, lurking bug. But at that point, we\u2019re asking people to part with their money, and they should not be getting a broken product. I think that\u2019s where a number of people are going wrong with Early Access. They\u2019re treating it like a paid beta.\u201d\n\nSteam Greenlight is a cluttered mess. It started out as a promising platform to help aspiring indie developers build their games, find an audience for them, and eventually, sell them. In its current state, it\u2019s ability to do those three things effectively has diminished somewhat.\n\n\u201cI think when they threw Early Access out there, Valve were expecting developers to be\u2026 mature about it\u2013let\u2019s put it that way\u2013to be mature about it and respect their clients and get it through their skull that you\u2019re asking for money at this point, so you do not piss about.\u201d\n\nSteam Greenlight has value for the makers of games like The Forest and Monstrum, and even the growing number of horror stories it continues to be a reliable source of won\u2019t be able to completely ruin that. \u201cYou do not piss about\u201d are words that some would-be developers could learn from.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The makers of Killing Floor 2 have some words of wisdom to share.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Bloody Disgusting!", "description": "The makers of Killing Floor 2 have some words of wisdom to share.", "title": "Early Access Developers Can Learn from 'Killing Floor 2' - Bloody Disgusting!", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://cdn.bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/KF2_SEA_Adv.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3348355/early-access-developers-can-learn-killing-floor-2/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 452886758230029}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i0.wp.com/bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cropped-bd_circlelogo.png?fit=270%2C270", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BloodyDisgusting/", "section": "News", "tag": "tripwire interactive", "published_time": "2015-06-07T21:15:11-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb94d\"", "article_summary": "Since the arrival of Killing Floor 2 on Steam Early Access back in April, Tripwire Interactive has used the game\u2019s fervent community as a tool for guiding its development.\n\u201cWe do not subscribe to the view that things that go into Early Access should be broken,\u201d Wilson said.\nI think that\u2019s where a number of people are going wrong with Early Access.\n\u201cYou do not piss about\u201d are words that some would-be developers could learn from.\nIt started out as a promising platform to help aspiring indie developers build their games, find an audience for them, and eventually, sell them."}
