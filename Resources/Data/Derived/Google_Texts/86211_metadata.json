The letter, signed by 111 prominent clerics from around the world, lists dozens of ways in which the clerics assert that ISIS has consistently violated Islamic law.\n\nIt urges ISIS leader and their followers to \u201cReconsider all your actions; desist from them; repent from them; cease harming others and return to the religion of mercy.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Tough Talk May Not Be Enough to Beat ISIS\n\nNihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a presentation at the National Press Club in Washington that the purpose of the letter is to \u201cdebunk and expose the falsity\u201d of the claim that ISIS is operating within the dictates of the Islamic religion.\n\nThe letter is written in classical Arabic, but an English translation was provided to reporters.

Siddiqi, chairman of the Fiqh Council of North America, the most senior Islamic jurisprudential body in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThis so-called Islamic State is not a state and does not represent anything that is Islamic,\u201d said Oussama Jammal, secretary general of the U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations. \u201cNone of their actions pass any litmus test to show that they have a sound understanding of Islamic ideas.\u201d\n\nRelated: Fighting ISIS Could Mean Higher Ratings for Obama\n\nThe list of signatories includes Islamic clerics from around the world, including Sheikh Shawqi Allam, the Grand Mufti of Egypt; Sheikh Mustafa Cagrici, the former Mufti of Istanbul; Sheikh Muhammad Ahmad Hussein, Mufti of Palestine; and dozens of other highly-regarded Islamic clerics.\n\nAwad, of CAIR, said that he believed the American Muslim community \u201chas spoken many times\u201d about its opposition to ISIS, but that \u201cit is time for mainstream Muslims around the world to condemn\u201d the group.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Top Muslim leaders in the United States on Wednesday released", "title": "More Than 100 Muslim Clerics Sign Letter Condemning ISIS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/24/More-100-Muslim-Clerics-Sign-Letter-Condemning-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09252014_Islam_Dictionary_Definition.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/24/More-100-Muslim-Clerics-Sign-Letter-Condemning-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09252014_Islam_Dictionary_Definition.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Top Muslim leaders in the United States on Wednesday released", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd038f\"", "article_summary": "The letter, signed by 111 prominent clerics from around the world, lists dozens of ways in which the clerics assert that ISIS has consistently violated Islamic law.\nTop Muslim leaders in the United States on Wednesday released a detailed refutation of claims by the terrorist group ISIS that its actions in Iraq and Syria are in keeping with Islamic law.\nThe letter is written in classical Arabic, but an English translation was provided to reporters.\nAddressed to ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi and to \u201cThe fighters and followers of the self-declared \u2018Islamic State,\u2019\u201d it addresses 24 different statements or actions by ISIS and its members that the signatories say are specific violations of Islamic law.\nAwad, of CAIR, said that he believed the American Muslim community \u201chas spoken many times\u201d about its opposition to ISIS, but that \u201cit is time for mainstream Muslims around the world to condemn\u201d the group."}
