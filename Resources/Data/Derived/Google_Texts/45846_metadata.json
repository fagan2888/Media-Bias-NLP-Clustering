Passengers, as well as behavior detection officers themselves, have complained that this process results in unfair racial profiling.\u201d\n\nTSA officials declined to comment on the pending litigation, but a spokesman for the agency told The Hill it's been working to fulfill the ACLU\u2019s information request.\n\nThe agency has touted the behavior detection program as one of its risk-based initiatives that have improved airport security.\n\n\u201cOur risk-based security initiatives boost the effectiveness of security resources by focusing them on high-risk and unknown travelers and commerce, while at the same time facilitating the efficient movement of legitimate travelers and commerce and trade,\u201d Acting TSA Administrator Melvin Carraway told lawmakers in a February hearing.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The group says a TSA program \"has given rise to allegations of racial profiling.\"", "description": "The group says a TSA program \"has given rise to allegations of racial profiling.\"", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Keith Laing", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The group says a TSA program \"has given rise to allegations of racial profiling.\"", "title": "ACLU sues feds over airport screenings", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/236257-tsa-sued-over-behavior-detection-program", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/tsa-10510_getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-19T12:12:45-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-03-19T12:12-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/236257-tsa-sued-over-behavior-detection-program", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-19T10:24-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Keith Laing", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Transportation Security Administration, TSA Behavior detection program, American Civil Liberties Union,Melvin Carraway,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-19T10:24:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-19T12:12:45-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/transportation/236257-tsa-sued-over-behavior-detection-program", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The group says a TSA program \"has given rise to allegations of racial profiling.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "ACLU sues feds over airport screenings"}, "dcterms.title": "ACLU sues feds over airport screenings"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb855\"", "article_summary": "The agency has touted the behavior detection program as one of its risk-based initiatives that have improved airport security.\nThe ACLU has alleged the behavior detection program gives TSA agents license to racially profile passengers.\nThe American Civil Liberties Union is suing the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for information about its behavior detection program.\nA separate program, known as \u201cTSA Pre-Check,\u201d allows passengers to volunteer information about themselves and a pay a fee to avoid hassles at airport security checkpoints.\nADVERTISEMENT\u201cAs part of the program, thousands of \u2018behavior detection\u2019 officers scrutinize the behavior of travelers in airport screening areas in an attempt to identify anyone who may pose a security risk,\u201d the ACLU said in a blog post about the lawsuit."}
