Image 6 of 6 | Hurry up and destroy America, already! Shut up, facts Shut up, facts\n\nWill Obama destroy America before it\u2019s too late?\n\nBack to Gallery\n\n\n\nAmerica! Something is amiss. We are in the final throes of a desperate situation, and the numbers just aren\u2019t adding up. What can be done?\n\nThe facts are almost too dreadful to discuss: No matter how you slice it, spin it, or openly lie about it like Ted Cruz on a ketamine bender, it\u2019s become officially impossible to find any true and tangible evidence that President Obama \u2013 AKA Kenyan Comrade Nazi Socialist Obama \u2013 has utterly destroyed America, as promised.\n\nWorse still, there is very little time left. The months are ticking away until Obama leaves office and becomes something altogether more terrifying: One of the most effective, lauded, sought-after ex-presidents in American history, next to Bill Clinton. Calamitous!\n\nErgo, the question is getting more urgent by the day: Can he still do it? Is there enough time for President Obama to undo all the undeniable improvements and socioeconomic progress that President Obama hath wrought? Let us pray.\n\nThe signs, regrettably, are not good. Unemployment just hit an eight-year low, down to 4.9 percent. Wages are (finally) ticking up, keeping better pace with all the new jobs, another 150,000 in January alone, officially joining Obama\u2019s nauseating string of 71 straight months of consecutive job growth.\n\nThat\u2019s downright shameful. Reports suggest the economy is so robust, many people are actually quitting their jobs, confident they will easily find another, thanks to the Obama-led economic recovery. Dude must be mortified.\n\nIt gets worse. It turns out the Affordable Care Act, which every Right-wing politician and pundit, bar none, swore on his mother\u2019s dead Medicare would devastate the economy and cause what was already the worst, most expensive, least effective health care system in the modern world to implode completely, has instead added another 13 million to the roster of the newly insured, most of them younger people.\n\nUglier still? Minimal adverse effects. It\u2019s doing pretty great, actually. Insurance companies have not collapsed. Rates, for most, have been dinged only mildly. Doctors are not jumping out of windows. And of course, millions now have insurance who would otherwise have been prevented from getting it before, and you can\u2019t be turned down for pre-existing conditions, and\u2026 oh, hell, you know the rest. Blah blah blah, good news many improvements everybody\u2019s mostly pretty happy.\n\nFools!\n\nPerhaps a bit of gratitude is in order? Because truly, it could have been a lot worse. What if those early liberal visions for true health care overhaul \u2013 single-payer, for example \u2013 hadn\u2019t been so brutally beaten down by the Right? What if real reform had taken place? Or, for that matter, real environmental legislation? What if the GOP and the late Justice Scalia weren\u2019t so helpfully, openly partisan and grossly obstructionist?\n\nDisaster, that\u2019s what. Pharmaceutical lobbyists would almost certainly be less obscenely powerful. Exxon\u2019s donations to GOP SuperPACs would slump. Hospital executives would struggle to buy a third Range Rover. Ghastly!\n\nSo I ask again, with extra ominousness: Why aren\u2019t we suffering more? Why aren\u2019t the vast majority of Americans far worse off? I mean, is this it? When will this nightmare of imperfect growth, recovery and undeniably improved overall health finally end?\n\nLook, it\u2019s been nearly eight years. The mellow intellectual socialist black dude has had forever to make good on the GOP\u2019s fanatical demand that he ruin the nation and impregnate their terrified white daughters. Shouldn\u2019t the rich be much less rich? Shouldn\u2019t the stock market have collapsed by now?\n\nWhy is America\u2019s standing in the world so much better than a decade ago? Why are gay people so goddamn happy? Why are women becoming increasingly powerful and omnipresent? Why is the Republican party mocked and derided the world over? What happened to the ruinous supremacy of the Angry White Christian Male?\n\nThe answer, of course, is obvious: You\u2019ve been duped.\n\nDon\u2019t you get it? Everything is actually far worse than it seems. There are no jobs. You are not healthy. Your stock portfolio has not exploded in the past decade. CNN Money is lying when it says \u201cObama is shaping up to be one of the best presidents for the stock market in modern history, even with the recent pullback in 2016.\u201d It is not likely you reading this column right now on a beautiful, technologically marvelous digital device paid for, in sum, by the overall economic recovery. North is actually south. Progress is actually failure. Women and black people and Muslims and immigrants are actually destroying the country.\n\nAll part of a monstrous liberal hoax, you see, this \u201crecovery,\u201d this \u201crobust economy,\u201d this \u201chistoric resurgence,\u201d exactly like climate science and organic bananas, electric cars and feminism. Don\u2019t you see?\n\nHere\u2019s the real truth: We are, each of us, floating inside a strange, mystical eight-year Obamabubble made of thoughtful rejoinders, Zen-like calm and effortless three-pointers from the perimeter. It\u2019s a bubble that\u2019s about to pop any second to reveal that the Dow is really at 3,000, ISIS has taken over the Freedom Tower and we\u2019ve all been speaking German and just didn\u2019t realize it.\n\nIt\u2019s the only way to explain it. How else to vindicate the curdled Republican Establishment, every member of which has been so egregiously, so laughably wrong, and so consistently, for eight years straight? How to excuse the fact that every one of them has been promising us the exact same thing: a face-melting Obamacalypse, any second now?\n\nAnd yet\u2026 nothing. Just the opposite, in fact. The poor dears.\n\nSurely, some underwhelming charts exist. If you tweak the metric a little, unemployment isn\u2019t all that great \u2013 it\u2019s only, uh, moderately great. And many of those new jobs cited by the DOL are low-wage and service sector. And employment participation rates aren\u2019t quite as strong as they could be. So, you know, take that.\n\nAlso, military spending is actually up. And the truth is, Obama\u2019s health care reform is pretty weak on the actual reform: Insurance companies are still making billions. Big Pharma has never been so powerful. Most hospitals are still for-profit. Wall Street could not be more happily coldblooded.\n\nWait, isn\u2019t that good news? Obama\u2019s policies have only made the rich richer, the military machine more bloated, the stock market explode, oil companies mostly quite happy? I\u2019m getting confused.\n\nBut never mind that now. Because it appears Obama hasn\u2019t given up just yet.\n\nBehold, his administration\u2019s final, $4.1 trillion budget. It\u2019s packed to the brim with all sorts of nation-killing initiatives, soul-destroying taxes and hope-obliterating spending plans, a gruesome pile of mostly good ideas, a few fairly lousy ones and a handful of truly great ones that, should some of them actually make it through, would almost certainly leave the country much better off\u2026 all by destroying us completely.\n\nTypical.\n\nGood luck, Mr. President! We\u2019re all pulling for you.
