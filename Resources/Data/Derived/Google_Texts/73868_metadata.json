On Wednesday, a federal judge denied a request to toss out the jury verdict or grant them a new trial.\n\nThe NASD Board of Trustees voted Tuesday to terminate Hill\u2019s contract, while Smith turned in her resignation Wednesday morning.\n\nSmith was named director of the alternative program at TPSD\u2019s Fillmore Center at a special-called school board meeting Thursday morning at the Hancock Learning Center.\n\nGearl Loden, superintendent of Tupelo Schools, said Smith resigned from her position in Natchez to come to TPSD.\n\nLoden also said he has heard nothing but positive feedback regarding Smith\u2019s hire from both TPSD employees and community members.\n\n\u201cOur district is one of the highest-rated districts in the state, and Dr. Smith has worked here before and she worked with our curriculum team and at the high school,\u201d Loden said. \u201cShe had the courage to go to a district that was one of the historic underperformers in the state and try to make a difference. We\u2019re well aware of the situation, and we are confident in her ability to do well in Tupelo. We have all the confidence that we can in Dr. Smith.\u201d\n\nSmith worked for Tupelo Schools as a curriculum coordinator for grades 9-12 and as an assistant principal at Tupelo High School before taking a job with the Natchez-Adams School District.\n\n\u201cShe did well here, and when you look at places, you have to have the right fit,\u201d Loden said. \u201cShe has a good record here.\u201d\n\nemma.crawford@journalinc.com\n\nTwitter: @emcrawfordkent", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Emma Crawford Kent Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 Tupelo Public School District leaders say they are well aware a recently hired administrator was going through a racial discrimination lawsuit in Natchez just months ago, and they are confident in her abilities to do well in Tupelo.
