What they did not expect, however, were the swift and racist reactions they saw from several of their fans. Example: \"This clench-first gorilla [sic] warrior does not deserve respect from informed Americans,\" one user wrote on Gingrich's Facebook.\n\nStewart was hardly surprised by the outpouring of bile. \"Of course, that's why the Internet was invented,\" he said. \"To say hateful things with greater efficiency, reach and freedom to keep people from finding out how truly disgusting you are in your home. 'I would never say those things, it was Dr. Awesomeballs69!'\"\n\nRacist Facebook fans are one thing, but Stewart could not let an actual Republican leader off the hook so easily.
