They were escorted out by police while supporters cheered.\n\n\n\nSupporters said it\u2019s the presidential candidate's straightforward and passionate nature that drew them to him.\n\n\n\n\"He's self-funding. (I) love that. (I) love the fact that he speaks his heart, he speaks his mind, he's a true patriot,\" Lynette White said.\n\n\n\nCharlene Warner said she's seen too many negative changes in the country.\n\n\n\n\"Something is changed and somebody needs to fix it, (and) that's what he seems like he's going do,\" she said. \"He's a billionaire; he can't be bought.\"\n\nSecurity tightens at university for Trump campaign visit\n\nWith six weeks to go until South Carolina picks its Republican choice for president, Donald Trump is returning to the state.\n\nThe GOP hopeful is bringing his campaign to Rock Hill on Friday, when he plans to hold a rally at Winthrop University.\n\nTrump has been making regular appearances in this early voting state in recent months, drawing crowds in the thousands. On Dec. 30, the businessman was on Hilton Head Island, where he sought to assail Democrat Hillary Clinton by calling her husband, former President Bill Clinton, \"one of the great abusers of the world.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GSuskinWSOC9/status/685486657836060672\n\nWinthrop University police worked with the Secret Service to provide security for the Trump event. Everyone entering had to walk through a metal detector and people were asked not to carry in bags or backpacks.\n\nPolice had a similar security plan in place in November when the three main Democrat candidates for president were at Winthrop for a forum. About 3,500 were in attendance for that event, about half the size of the Trump crowd.\n\nWinthrop police would not discuss specific security plans but did say extra officers were in place throughout the night.\n\nPolice also said the Trump campaign asked them to step in and remove protesters if they interrupted the event.\u200b\n\nBush returns to South Carolina with Upstate stop\n\nRepublican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush is spending some more time in South Carolina's Upstate.\n\nBush is speaking at Dyar's Diner in Pendleton on Friday. Doors open at 5:30 p.m., and the former Florida governor is set to speak an hour later.\n\nBush is also taking part in a poverty forum being held in Columbia on Saturday. The Jack Kemp Foundation Forum on Expanding Opportunity is being held at the Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center and is moderated by House Speaker Paul Ryan and U.S. Sen. Tim Scott.\n\nOrganizers say other GOP hopefuls scheduled to participate include retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, businesswoman Carly Fiorina, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are also scheduled to participate.\n\nBe sure to download the WSOC-TV Wake Up app to get the latest breaking news, weather and traffic on your phone first thing in the mornings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Protesters were thrown out of a rally for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Friday.
