Trees were uprooted, some homes were damaged, and 10,000 people were left without power. Fortunately, only three individuals suffered injuries that required medical attention but were not life threatening.\n\nEvery tragedy has an element of humor. Mayor William Bell is seen in a photograph at the scene of the devastation. The report claims the mayor is directing traffic on flooded streets. There is not a car in sight and the water looks to be four inches deep at best. The mayor should be recognized for his show of concern for the citizens of the city. This action may serve to revive a somewhat tarnished reputation after a physical altercation between Bell and a fellow member of the City Council.\n\nNaturally, Governor Robert Bentley declared a state of emergency from the safety of Montgomery some 100 miles from the area that the tornado struck. With any luck, Bentley may be able to secure funds for restoring the damaged area from President Obama. The prospects of any federal assistance are doubtful because the tornado did not harm an area involving multiple counties or localities.\n\nBirmingham strives to present itself as a religious community. One has to wonder why a loving God would harm some of the poorest and most underprivileged residents of Birmingham on the day people celebrate the birth of Christ. It would seem more fitting that the serial philanderer Robert Bentley who has driven Alabama into debt by refusing to use Obamacare and the Medicaid subsidies that could have helped the victims of the tornado could have been the victim of this Christmas present from the Almighty.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A tornado of undefined strength devastated a two square-mile area in southwestern Birmingham during the early evening of Dec. 25, 2105, according to NBC News.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/birmingham-alabama-gets-a-tornado-for-christmas", "type": "article", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/d1/69/d16928a5dfe8d40c012b77d363a39dd3.jpg?itok=2Yl-VCun", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "title": "Birmingham, Alabama gets a tornado for Christmas"}, "twitter": {"description": "A tornado of undefined strength devastated a two square-mile area in southwestern Birmingham during the early evening of Dec. 25, 2105, according to NBC News.", "title": "Birmingham, Alabama gets a tornado for Christmas", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/d1/69/d16928a5dfe8d40c012b77d363a39dd3.jpg?itok=2Yl-VCun", "creator": "@PBHexam", "site": "@examinercom", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "dc.date.issued": "2015-12-26T07:20:59-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 113003962065478}, "keywords": "Weather, tornado, Birmingham", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-26T07:20"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Naturally, Governor Robert Bentley declared a state of emergency from the safety of Montgomery some 100 miles from the area that the tornado struck.\nA tornado of undefined strength devastated a two square-mile area in southwestern Birmingham during the early evening of Dec. 25, 2105, according to NBC News.\nWith any luck, Bentley may be able to secure funds for restoring the damaged area from President Obama.\nThe prospects of any federal assistance are doubtful because the tornado did not harm an area involving multiple counties or localities.\nIt would seem more fitting that the serial philanderer Robert Bentley who has driven Alabama into debt by refusing to use Obamacare and the Medicaid subsidies that could have helped the victims of the tornado could have been the victim of this Christmas present from the Almighty."}
