Most of the different points it lays out boil down to one essential, overarching approach: Make HSR central to a larger transportation system that includes other alternatives to driving and is focused around smart growth. Successful high-speed rail requires more than just laying tracks between cities and buying fancy new rail cars.\n\nSpecifically, the report warns against putting stops in sparsely populated areas because that slows trains down. Put them only in the center of major cities, recommends report author Eric Eidlin, as Germany has done. [...]\n\nFor high-speed rail to fulfill its potential, it must be one component of a low-carbon society. L.A. and San Diego need to become more like Berlin and Hamburg \u2014 and San Francisco and New York. That means being denser, with walkable and bikeable streets, public transit systems, and regional commuter rail lines to the suburbs. That would allow people to arrive in town on the train and hop on a bus or subway, or hail an affordable taxi, to get to their final destination and then get around while they are in town. L.A. is working on that, and other California towns and cities should too. Or, as Eidlin puts it in his report, \u201cIn order for HSR to deliver on its promise to 38 million Californians and investors, the project must be designed as the backbone of a comprehensive system for sustainable passenger mobility in California.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "ICE 3 high-speed train from Cologne to Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nAt Grist, Ben Adler writes What America can learn from Europe\u2019...", "title": "Open thread for night owls\u2014Adler: What the U.S. can learn from Europe's high-speed trains", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/9/7/1419228/-Open-thread-for-night-owls-Adler-What-the-U-S-can-learn-from-Europe-s-high-speed-trains", "image": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/163118/story_image/ICE3_Dernbachertunnel.jpg?1441659907", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "ICE 3 high-speed train from Cologne to Frankfurt, Germany.\n\nAt Grist, Ben Adler writes What America can learn from Europe\u2019s high-speed trains:\nRiding the high-speed train between Berlin and Hamburg...", "title": "Open thread for night owls\u2014Adler: What the U.S. can learn from Europe's high-speed trains", "image": {"src": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/163118/story_image/ICE3_Dernbachertunnel.jpg?1441659907"}, "creator": "@Meteor_Blades", "site": "@dailykos", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ce3\"", "article_summary": "The German Marshall Fund put out a report in June on the lessons California could draw from the well-developed HSR systems in Germany and France.\nSuccessful high-speed rail requires more than just laying tracks between cities and buying fancy new rail cars.\nL.A. and San Diego need to become more like Berlin and Hamburg \u2014 and San Francisco and New York.\nPut them only in the center of major cities, recommends report author Eric Eidlin, as Germany has done.\nThat means being denser, with walkable and bikeable streets, public transit systems, and regional commuter rail lines to the suburbs."}
