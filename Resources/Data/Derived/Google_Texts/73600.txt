Breitbart News recently published a column attacking Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch for representing the Clintons during the Whitewater scandal, only to slowly retract it, and eventually deleting it, when they discovered they’d been writing about the wrong Loretta Lynch. This story was tailor-made for The Colbert Report.

“I give a tip of my hat to Breitbart News for breaking a story, finding out that it’s broken, and then sticking to the story anyway,” Stephen Colbert said last night, pointing out that Breitbart and its columnist, “Teddy Roosevelt,” had left the post up with the same headline with “(Correction)” added to it, and the actual correction at the very bottom of the article. To underscore how shockingly inaccurate Breitbart’s column was, Colbert showed two photos of the two Lynches: One of them was black, and the other was very not-black.

“By not taking down a headline that you know is false, they are craven political hatchet men,” Colbert railed. “Oh — they eventually took it down? My apologies. They are craven political hatchet men (corrected).”
