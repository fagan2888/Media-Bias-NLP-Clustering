Lean Bear spoke for peace, and after his visit to the nation\u2019s capital, his tribe considered him \u201ca big friend of the whites.\u201d\n\nLess than 15 months after this visit to Washington, Chief Lean Bear lay dead on the plains of Kansas, shot by soldiers of the 1st Colorado Cavalry. Toting a peace medal and papers given to him by President Lincoln, the Chief greeted the soldiers with ease on May 16. When commanding officer Lieutenant George Eayre gave the order to fire, Lean Bear had no warning. Less than 50 yards away from the soldiers, he fell and was shot again on the ground as the soldiers rode past.\n\nAccording to George Bent, after the murder of Lean Bear, \u201cThe Cheyennes were so stirred up\u2026that the chiefs could not control the young warriors.\u201d Soon, vengeful parties of Dog Soldiers went on the warpath, escalating the fears of government officials, settlers, and the U.S. Army. The death of Chief Lean Bear proved critical in the chain of events culminating in the Sand Creek Massacre.\n\nThe irony of Lean Bear\u2019s death was reflected in a speech made to Abraham Lincoln. The chief said he \u201cdeplored the war between the whites, now being waged\u201d and expressed determination that his tribe \u201ctake no part or sides in it.\u201d Lean Bear also stated he \u201cwished to live in peace for the balance of his life.\u201d\n\nTo learn more about the murder of Chief Lean Bear, visit NPS.gov/sand or visit the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site outside of Eads, Colorado.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The murder of Cheyenne Chief Lean Bear stirred up the Dog Soldiers who went on the warpath, escalating the fears of government officials, settlers.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/16/native-history-murder-chief-lean-bear-results-revenge-154709", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/unidentified-chief-dc.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Native History: Murder of Chief Lean Bear Leads to War, Sandy Creek Massacre"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Native History: Murder of Chief Lean Bear Leads to War, Sandy Creek Massacre"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/05/16/native-history-murder-chief-lean-bear-results-revenge-154709", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "dcterms.date": "2014-05-16T10:00-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Sand Creek Massacre, Native American History", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.title": "Native History: Murder of Chief Lean Bear Leads to War, Sandy Creek Massacre"}, "article_summary": "The death of Chief Lean Bear proved critical in the chain of events culminating in the Sand Creek Massacre.\nThis article is part of a series by the National Park Service concerning the 150th Anniversary of the Sand Creek Massacre.\nWhen commanding officer Lieutenant George Eayre gave the order to fire, Lean Bear had no warning.\nToting a peace medal and papers given to him by President Lincoln, the Chief greeted the soldiers with ease on May 16.\nLean Bear spoke for peace, and after his visit to the nation\u2019s capital, his tribe considered him \u201ca big friend of the whites.\u201dLess than 15 months after this visit to Washington, Chief Lean Bear lay dead on the plains of Kansas, shot by soldiers of the 1st Colorado Cavalry."}
