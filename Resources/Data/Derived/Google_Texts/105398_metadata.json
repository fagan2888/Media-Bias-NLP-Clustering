The plan, which has not been finalized, could bring a larger skate bowl and artificial turf to a 2-acre area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming, and we feel very lucky,\u201d Director of Ventura Parks, Recreation and Community Partnerships Elena Brokaw said.\n\nAs the only Ventura park with a community center, Westpark is a heavily used facility in a neighborhood that Brokaw called \u201cpark-deficient.\u201d\n\nLast year, the city received funding from the same program for the construction of Kellogg Park, which is expected to open in 2017.\n\nEstella Park, the oldest park in Thousand Oaks, will receive $280,000 to renovate the playground and tennis court. The grant will also fund fencing and gate modifications, sign improvements and other fixes.\n\nThe 2-acre park dates to the mid-1960s and is heavily used.\n\nTom Hare, administrator for the Conejo Recreation and Park District, said Estella Park is in a high-density area of the city and needs upgrades.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect spot to invest money,\u201d Hare said.\n\nThe grant was rewarded following the completion of the Garden View Apartments, an Area Housing Authority of Ventura County project on Los Feliz Drive. The apartments have 54 affordable units, with some reserved for residents earning as little as 30 percent of the region\u2019s median income.\n\nIn Santa Paula, Teague Park and Mill Park restrooms will be renovated, thanks to a $516,000 grant. Both parks were built in the mid-1970s and haven\u2019t been upgraded since.\n\nAt Ebell Park in downtown Santa Paula, the original irrigation system from 1964 will receive a complete upgrade.\n\nA number of affordable housing projects put the city in a position to receive the funding and include Rodney Fernandez Gardens, Orchard Place and two Trinity Lane units built by Habitat for Humanity.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Park upgrades on the way for Ventura, Thousand Oaks, Santa Paula", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/news/local/conejo-valley/park-upgrades-on-the-way-for-ventura-thousand-oaks-santa-paula-ep-1172024546-340405701.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/5_vclo_parksmoney_webonly_20780755_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 415}, "type": "article", "description": "Five parks in Ventura County will receive a total of $1.2 million for renovation projects from the California Department of Housing and Community Development.", "title": "Park upgrades on the way for Ventura, Thousand Oaks, Santa Paula"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/5_vclo_parksmoney_webonly_20780755_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Five parks in Ventura County will receive a total of $1.2 million for renovation projects from the California Department of Housing and Community Development.", "site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Park upgrades on the way for Ventura, Thousand Oaks, Santa Paula"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe09ff\"", "article_summary": "In Santa Paula, Teague Park and Mill Park restrooms will be renovated, thanks to a $516,000 grant.\nWestpark Park, in Ventura; Estella Park, in Thousand Oaks; and Ebell, Teague and Mill parks, in Santa Paula, were selected for a housing-related parks program that provides grants to communities with recent affordable housing projects.\nAt Ebell Park in downtown Santa Paula, the original irrigation system from 1964 will receive a complete upgrade.\nEstella Park, the oldest park in Thousand Oaks, will receive $280,000 to renovate the playground and tennis court.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming, and we feel very lucky,\u201d Director of Ventura Parks, Recreation and Community Partnerships Elena Brokaw said."}
