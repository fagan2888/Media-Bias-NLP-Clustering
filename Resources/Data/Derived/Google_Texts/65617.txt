A teen from Thornton was killed on Interstate 25 early Sunday after she was ejected from a Jeep and struck by two cars, the State Patrol reported.

Marysol Tarango, 19, was not wearing her seatbelt shortly after 5 a.m., when the northbound 2001 Jeep Wrangler went off the left side of the highway between E-470 and Colorado 7, east of Erie, and collided twice with a concrete barrier. The State Patrol said she was ejected through a rear window from the backseat and landed in the center lane, where she was struck by a 2005 Toyota Tacoma and a 2008 Toyota Sienna.

She was pronounced dead at the scene.

The Jeep rolled onto its left side after Tarango was ejected. Inside, two 19-year-old women from Greeley, Madeline Perez and Madison Walton, sustained minor injuries. They were taken to a hospital.

Perez, who was driving the Jeep, was wearing her seatbelt. Walton was not.

The State Patrol said the drivers of the two Toyotas were not injured, remained at the scene and cooperated with the investigation.

The patrol suspects alcohol use may have been a contributing factor in the crash. Charges against Perez are pending the completion of the investigation, the release said.
