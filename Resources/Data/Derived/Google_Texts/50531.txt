A new Tiger Woods Learning Center has opened within the Cristo Rey Philadelphia High School, created through a partnership between the Tiger Woods Foundation, Cristo Rey and United States Liability Insurance Group (USLI), headquartered in Wayne, Pa.

The TWLC’s afterschool program provides science, technology, engineering and math education to first-year students and sophomores.

“The foundation and USLI fund the teacher, the equipment, the curriculum, the computers; it’s a really comprehensive program that all comes from them,” said John McConnell, founder and president of the school.

USLI also assisted with the school’s start-up efforts in 2012 and hosts students in work-experience programs one day a week. Money earned goes directly toward the cost of the students’ education. USLI also helped develop Cristo Rey’s fitness center and designed the artwork for a bus that transports students to and from work and other excursions.

USLI is a Berkshire Hathaway company and provides coverage for small businesses and specialty products.
