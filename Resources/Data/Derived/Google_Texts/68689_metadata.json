Phil Roe (R-TN) and Austin Scott (R-GA). The authors describe it as an \u201caspirational model\u201d of American health care and say it\u2019s open for amendments.\n\nHighlights include fully repealing President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, eliminating billions of dollars in taxes and thousands of pages of unworkable regulations and mandates that drive up health care costs, expanding federal funding for state high-risk pools, allowing health insurance plan purchases across state lines, reforming medical liability laws, and investing in research for the most common causes of death in the United States.\n\nAHCRA covers four broad areas: It encourages competition in the health care market, improves health care access for vulnerable Americans, supports medical breakthroughs, and reforms medical liability laws, according to its authors.\n\nFlexibility Praised\n\nJosh Archambault, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Government Accountability, says AHCRA lays a solid foundation for greater access to insurance for more people than Obamacare provides, unlocks greater competition between health insurers, and helps lower the cost of insurance for most people.\n\n\u201cThe bill is right to focus on health savings accounts as a tool to engage consumers in their health care,\u201d Archambault said. \u201cThese tools need to be more flexible, and this bill would help significantly in that effort.\u201d\n\nArchambault expresses concerns about the provisions for high risk pools for those with preexisting conditions. He says these pools had mixed records before Obamacare was enacted in 2010 and can be very expensive. Archambault suggests the federal government should instead seek state-based solutions, such as the pre-Obamacare high-risk reinsurance systems in Idaho and Maine, which cover individuals with preexisting conditions but keep them in the market with everyone else to keep premium costs down.\n\nArchambault is also concerned AHCRA contains some questionable provisions that may violate constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cThere remain constitutional questions about doing medical malpractice reform at the federal level,\u201d said Archambault. \u201cThis would be better handled at the state level.\u201d\n\nIt is unlikely Obama would sign a law that repeals 100 percent of his signature law, but many ideas in the bill could end up in a replacement plan from Congress that gets signed by the president if the plaintiffs win the upcoming U.S. Supreme Court decision in King v. Burwell, Archambault says.\n\n\u201cThe other political obstacle would be a move away from employer-based insurance to this standard deduction, but it is worth starting the conversation about such a change, as it has caused many of the dysfunctions we are dealing with today in healthcare,\u201d said Archambault.\n\n\u2018More Freedom and Control\u2019\n\nTwila Brase, president of the Citizens\u2019 Council for Health Freedom, says the proposed bill would go a long way toward restoring health care freedom in America.\n\n\u201c[This] bill would not only expand choices for private health insurance, it would also give citizens more freedom and control over their health care dollars in health savings accounts and repeal a controversial comparative effectiveness council that could be used to ration care,\u201d Brase said.\n\nBrase says the tax incentives for individuals would move people toward privately purchasing and individually owning health insurance policies, which is a necessity for reducing health care costs and avoiding preexisting condition exclusions.\n\n\u201cGiven our organization\u2019s support for moving health care away from the federal level and to the states, we\u2019re pleased that this bill would remove many of the federal controls now in place as a result of Obamacare and other restrictive federal laws and regulations,\u201d Brase said.\n\nReintroducing Competition\n\nThe bill does not eliminate federal health insurance subsidies but makes them fairer, says Dr. Doug Perednia, author of Overhauling America\u2019s Healthcare Machine.\n\n\u201cThey are substituting subsidies in the form of tax deductions for actual payments to individuals or insurers on the part of the government,\u201d said Perednia. \u201cWhile the ultimate impact on federal deficits may be similar, this is a huge improvement because it finally places the payment of individual health care premiums on the same tax footing as payment of health care premiums by businesses.\u201d\n\nThe favored treatment of premiums paid by businesses has been a huge source of inequity for people who are unemployed or are trying to start their own small businesses and do not have the financial means to purchase health insurance through their company, Peredina says.\n\n\u201cObamacare advocates should be overjoyed at this, because it directly removes the insurance-based \u2018job lock\u2019 that prevents people from leaving their current jobs in order to follow their artistic, familial, or entrepreneurial tendencies,\u201d Perednia said.\n\nPraises Freedom to Choose\n\nThe bill\u2019s plan to provide everyone with a standard deduction for health insurance\u2014$7,500 per individual or $20,500 per family\u2014would be a great improvement over the current system, says Devon Herrick, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis.\n\n\u201cThis is far better than relegating Americans to coverage they must obtain in malfunctioning exchanges with convoluted subsidies,\u201d Herrick said. \u201cMoreover, Americans would be free to choose the type of coverage that best meets their needs rather than being forced to enroll in a plan that\u2019s not of their own choosing.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Health Care News.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A group of House Republicans released a proposed health care plan that would replace Obamacare with patient-centered reforms and free-market solutions.\nThe authors describe it as an \u201caspirational model\u201d of American health care and say it\u2019s open for amendments.\nThe 192-page American Health Care Reform Act (AHCRA) was written by Reps.
