We\u2019re taking off all those old parts \u2013 the really kind of awful looking parts that don\u2019t belong there \u2013 and moving ahead and getting it ready for the addition in 2016.\u201d\n\nAlthough 2015 promises much anew, the past year saw its fair share of controversy that began with city council\u2019s approval of the schematic design in July.\n\nNumerous delegations came forward, upset council chose the approve the design, including a glass addition, just four days (including a weekend) after it was released during a public meeting.\n\nMany people called the design ugly, some referring to the glass addition to facilitate a new digital library as a \u201cglass tumour\u201d that would ruin the heritage appeal of the downtown area.\n\nSince that time, however, alterations have been made to reduce the size of a cantilever and other features deemed extrusive.\n\n\u201cThe steering committee is still meeting and there\u2019s still modifications that are taking place (with the architects),\u201d said Craig.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in the design right now. There will still be some modification. There\u2019s a number of different things they have to answer, from accessibility for the handicapped to library needs to the restaurant and all of that being put in together.\u201d\n\nDuring a tour of the building this past summer, Slobodanka Lekic, the city\u2019s manager of building construction, pointed out that more of the historic building\u2019s stonework will be visible once the revamp is completed.\n\nThe current wooden addition tacked onto the west side of the original structure will be removed to accommodate a larger, glass addition, thereby revealing more of the original stonework.\n\nAs part of the project\u2019s $12.5-million budget, approximately $5 million will be spent on heritage preservation, she said.\n\nThe city has posted an animated, 3D video of the design concept. People can view it by logging onto the city\u2019s website at http://goo.gl/7tJY4R.\n\nThe schematic design proposes a teen space in the basement, a reading area, outdoor terrace overlooking the Grand River and restaurant on the main floor, a family discovery centre and outdoor terrace on the second floor and digital learning labs on the third floor.\n\nThough a needs justification wasn\u2019t conducted to warrant a new digital library, project backers have pointed out the building was falling into disrepair without any purpose and space for programming at the nearby Queen\u2019s Square branch of Cambridge public library is limited.\n\nA restoration and reuse project of such magnitude just isn\u2019t feasible for businesses in the private sector, according to John Oldfield, chair of the Municipal Heritage Advisory Committee.\n\n\u201cIf the city hadn\u2019t purchased the building, it would have continued in a downward trajectory,\u201d he noted.\n\nCity council has also put in an offer to purchase commercial property next door to the former post office.\n\nThe purchase proposal, though still not finalized, is intended to gain better access to the river from the downtown area and was completely independent of the library project, Craig emphasized in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cThe old post office design implementation and go-ahead did not depend on that property,\u201d he said.\n\nThe city\u2019s $350,000 proposal to purchase the building upset a commercial tenant who learned about it from the Times.\n\nA number of residents have also attempted to garner more information about the post office project through Freedom of Information Act requests, questioning documents and reports pertaining to the purchase of the building, the basis for cost estimates and partner arrangements for the restaurant with the Landmark Group, the former owner of the post office building, which operates several restaurants and facilities in the local region, including the Cambridge Mill.\n\nOne of those individuals seeking more information is Jan Liggett who was elected during the October municipal election to represent Ward 4 on city council.\n\nDuring a previous interview, Liggett said she believes the process behind the multi-million dollar project has been deliberately secretive.\n\n\u201cTo me, the public should have the information and it\u2019s not there, and it\u2019s a struggle to get that information,\u201d she said.\n\nLiggett was recently appointed to the post office project steering committee and said she intends to ask questions moving forward.\n\nThe next steering committee meeting is scheduled for Jan. 20.\n\nbjackson@cambirdgetimes.ca", "article_metadata": {"RATING": "GENERAL", "DESCRIPTION": "CAMBRIDGE \u2013 One of the most prominent city projects moving forward in the new year will be restoration of Galt\u2019s former...", "COPYRIGHT": "\u00a9 Copyright 2016 Metroland Media Group Ltd.
