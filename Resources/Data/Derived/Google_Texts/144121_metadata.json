Half the country wishes they were reality TV Stars. They say he is brash, uncouth, and disrespectful to the army of political hacks he has been and will confront. They just don't get it. People want someone who will stand up for the Country Party in the face of the Government Party that has controlled both major parties for so long. The list of disconnects between the imperial rulers in Chicago-on-the-Potomac and the great unwashed out here in fly-over country is massive. It is easily more than enough to define a complete breakdown in the social contract of a limited government. A social contract forged in the Declaration of Independence and enshrined in the Constitution which defines the legitimacy of the current regime. The Progressive megaphones tell us this is the strongest economy in American History and that President Obama is the greatest chief executive of modern times. They even fantasize about the \"Obama Boom.\" Working people laugh when you try to sell them this obvious propaganda. The government tells us that we have reached full employment. Anyone who reads should know that over ninety-three million able bodied Americans no longer work and only a little over 150 million are working. Yet the government tells us there is 5% unemployment when the numbers say it is closer to 40%. Our leaders tell us there is no inflation no matter how many trillions of fiat dollars they print, and all of us who shop for our own food, buy our own clothes, or pay utility bills know otherwise. They tell us we won the war in Iraq. We may have won it by the time King George II left but since Prince Obama got his hands on it ISIS tells us we haven't. Our leaders say we have won in Afghanistan. Everyone in the world knows that the minute we leave the Taliban roll right back into Kabul and the sock puppets we have been supporting all these years as the leaders of a democratic Afghanistan will be flying to Switzerland in 747s filled with American taxpayer's cash. We are told Obamacare is a great success. Anyone who had insurance before it started knows that if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor has to be tempered by increased fees, increased deductibles, increased co-payments, and decreased covered services. They tell us and they tell us and they tell us, we just don't believe them anymore. If these belchers of beltway bromides think every day working Americans swallow any of this they have seriously underestimated our intelligence, our interest, and our attention spans. I have the opportunity to travel the country throughout the year. I take what some call back roads, the secondary roads that parallel America's vast Interstate system and that still goes through small towns instead of bypassing them and homogenizing everywhere in to anywhere. I try to stop at Mom-and-Pop restaurants and take every opportunity possible to talk with people about the issues of the day. Here's what I find, Trump, Trump, Trump. I believe the polls are skewed. Perhaps people don't want to say they are for Trump because they know the pollsters will look down on them as simple country bumpkins, racists, or reactionary supporters of old dead white guys. Perhaps they are talking to those who are at home when the workers are busy working. Whatever the reason I believe, and I predict that Trump is going to beat Hillary like a drum. He is going to win in a landslide, and he is going to drag the Republican Party that tried to reject him along for the ride. I am predicting that due to his wave election coattails the Republicans will increase their majorities in the House and the Senate. What is the cause of this phenomenon? Generations of politicians who run as outsiders and who become insiders as soon as they enter the moral and patriotic black hole and before they start swirling in the DC drain to their life-time pensions. Generations of politicians who sold us out in so-called free trade deals that gave others a free pass into our markets while keeping their own locked to us. Generations of politicians who have spent us into oblivion, printed more money that there is paper, and borrowed so much money from other nations that we are now the world's greatest debtor. So who is to blame for the coming over throw of the twin headed bird of prey that is the Government Party of Power: the politicians themselves. Living in their bubble asking why those who have no bread don't eat cake they have no idea of what is coming. Their pollsters are polling themselves and providing the information their paymasters want to see. And all the while out here in the Heartland a tsunami is brewing that will wash them all away. To paraphrase what Phil Ochs said so long ago, In tattered tuxedos they faced the new heroes\n\nAnd crawled about in confusion\n\nAll the hands raised, they stood there amazed\n\nIn the shattering of their illusions Many of the nattering nabobs of negativism who dominate the 24 hour news cycle have been waiting expectantly for Trump to make one mega-gaff that will destroy his campaign. To hear them crow you would believe he made it when he resurrected the phrase, \"America First.\" First used as the name of a widely based organization that sought to keep us out of World War Two. Then it was used in the nineties by Pat Buchanan in his prescient campaign to save America from the one-worlders. The left has done their best to make this a catch phrase for defeat because they hate not only what it says but what it implies. The Elite political class has sought to make it an unutterable phrase condemned by political correctness and exiled because in their minds to even say America First is to defile their one world religion. They may believe they have tarnished the concept with 75 years of negative propaganda and indoctrination but still 57% of American citizens believe in America First, they want an America First foreign policy, an America First trade policy, and an America First immigration policy. They want an America First president. My prediction: After all is said and done, after all the dust settles, after Crooked Hillary goes home to lick her wounds, after the neo-con talking heads and their K-Street financiers realize the prize has slipped from their hands it will end up that Trump Trumps Never-Trump.
