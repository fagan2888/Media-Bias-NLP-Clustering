Clinton responded by saying she wished people would stop \"listening to Republican propaganda.\" (AP)\n\nHOPKINSVILLE, Ky. \u2014 Hillary Clinton fired back at a woman who stood during a rally here Monday to disagree with a line in Clinton's stump speech about Kentucky\u2019s Republican Gov. Matt Bevin.\n\nThe exchange unfolded as Clinton discussed improvements that had occurred in the state on issues such as education, implementing the Affordable Care Act and lowering the unemployment rate \u2014 all of which she attributed to Bevin\u2019s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear.\n\n\u201cYour governor did such a great job and your current governor is trying to undo it all,\u201d Clinton said, referring to Bevin and Beshear.\n\nBut the woman, who had been sitting quietly in the audience, stood and shouted toward Clinton: \u201cThat is not true.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes it is, yes it is,\u201d Clinton responded before adding hotly: \u201cYou are entitled to your opinion, but you\u2019re not entitled to your own facts!\u201d\n\nThe crowed roared, some people leaving their chairs to cheer and hold up their Clinton signs.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton pauses while speaking at a get-out-the vote event at James E.
