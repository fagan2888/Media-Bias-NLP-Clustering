What would history look like if told by newspapers? What does it look like to scroll through 30 years of history on one page?

To glance at the past from a new perspective--one told by the media-- we took one newspaper page from each year for the last 30 years. The newspapers we chose do not reflect our favorite publications nor do they necessarily show the most important story from that year; we just wanted to give a flavor of what each year was like.
