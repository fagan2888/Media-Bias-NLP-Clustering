On Thursday, February 13, 2014, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that California's longstanding restrictions on carrying concealed handguns in public conflict with the Second Amendment, finding that California’s “may issue” standard, which requires that applicants demonstrate "good cause" for needing a concealed carry permit, undermines the Constitutional right to bear arms. Legal analysts expect the government to appeal the decision, which could send the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.

This ruling was made possible, in part, by California's 2011 ban on the open carry of unloaded firearms. Without the option to carry either openly or concealed, the court had few options but to find California's gun laws overly restrictive.

In light of this major gun rights ruling, take a look at Reason TV’s 2012 interview with Charles Nichols, president of California Right to Carry, about his legal challenges to California's gun laws. Originally released on March 19, 2012. The original text is below.

"It's unconstitutional to ban an entire class of weapons, one that the public find most useful for self-defense," says Charles Nichols, president of California Right To Carry and the man behind the first lawsuit to challenge California's open carry gun ban. Nichols sat down with Reason.tv's Tim Cavanaugh to discuss his lawsuit, which is actually targeting the original ban from the 1970s that prohibited the carrying of loaded weapons. They discussed his prospects for success, as well as California's extremely strict gun control laws and how they might hold up in a post-DC v. Heller world. About 6:14 minutes. Interview by Tim Cavanaugh. Edited by Zach Weissmueller. Shot by Paul Detrick, Anthony Fisher, and Weissmueller.

Update: Nichols, who has his own lawsuit challenging California's open carry ban pending, emailed asking that I clarify his opinion on Thursday's ruling:
