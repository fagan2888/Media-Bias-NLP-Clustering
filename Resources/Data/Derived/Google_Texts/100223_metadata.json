The FASB will instead retain the existing GAAP standards for insurance entities.\n\nBoth insurance trade groups issued statements on the issue.\n\nCharles Chamness, president and CEO of NAMIC, said FASB made the right decision to keep what he called \u201cthe gold standard\u201d of insurance accounting methods. \u201cFor the past year, we have forcefully advocated against changes to GAAP accounting for insurance contracts that would deviate significantly from current statutory accounting reporting requirements. GAAP are universally recognized as the gold standard in the world of accounting, and we\u2019re obviously very pleased the FASB came to agree with us.\u201d\n\nResponding to initiatives by the FASB and IASB, NAMIC mounted a multi-faceted campaign to thwart the imposition of the new international requirements on U.S. GAAP. NAMIC engaged member companies to submit letters to both the FASB and IASB. More than 70 comment letters were filed, which unanimously objected to any shift away from the existing requirements.\n\nNAMIC worked closely with staff at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners during its analysis of the IASB and FASB exposure drafts. In addition, it communicated concerns to the Federal Insurance Office and other federal agencies. NAMIC staff also participated in a FASB-sponsored roundtable discussion on the issue in December.\n\nIn addition, Phillip Carson, associate general counsel and director of financial regulatory policy for the American Insurance Association (AIA), issued a statement responding to the Financial Accounting Standard Board\u2019s (FASB) recommendations issued for property-casualty insurers. During the past year the FASB has been working to develop an insurance Accounting Standards Update (ASU) and began its re-deliberations.\n\nCarson\u2019s statement follows:\n\n\u201cAIA commends the FASB for its decision today to only seek targeted improvements in the existing financial reporting model for short duration contracts. Rather than switching to a new model that our members believe would have been unsuitable for property-casualty contracts and that would be costly to implement without an offsetting benefit, the FASB has today indicated a desire to only make improvements to the disclosures associated with the financial statements of insurance products.\n\n\u201cAs indicated in AIA\u2019s October 2013 comment letter, we disagree with the proposed changes to the insurance ASU because they would not have improved U.S. GAAP. However, in the interest of providing better information to the financial statement users, we believe the FASB\u2019s decision to consider making improvements in disclosures is a step in the right direction. This approach addresses users\u2019 concerns for better information, while maintaining a transparent accounting framework that better reflects the economic reality of the property-casualty insurance business.\n\n\u201cAIA is committed to working with the FASB and its staff in achieving high-quality accounting standards, and we look forward to providing further assistance to the FASB as it continues its re-deliberations of the insurance contracts proposal.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The decision by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to abandon its convergence efforts with the International Accounting Standards Board on insurance", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "IFAwebnews.com", "description": "The decision by the Financial Accounting Standards Board to abandon its convergence efforts with the International Accounting Standards Board on insurance contracts represents a major victory for t\u2026", "title": "FASB decision seen as good news for U.S. insurers: NAMIC, AIA", "url": "http://ifawebnews.com/2014/02/20/fasb-decision-is-a-major-victory-for-u-s-insurers-namic/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://ifawebnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Chamness-Charles.jpg", "height": 200}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-20T14:55:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-20T14:55:37+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "Fve8IDDdj94aX4Ar18+v33qGgAesGnY2YiqbnR5P17I="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc7e3\"", "article_summary": "During the past year the FASB has been working to develop an insurance Accounting Standards Update (ASU) and began its re-deliberations.\nCharles Chamness, president and CEO of NAMIC, said FASB made the right decision to keep what he called \u201cthe gold standard\u201d of insurance accounting methods.\n\u201cFor the past year, we have forcefully advocated against changes to GAAP accounting for insurance contracts that would deviate significantly from current statutory accounting reporting requirements.\nThe FASB will instead retain the existing GAAP standards for insurance entities.\n\u201cAIA is committed to working with the FASB and its staff in achieving high-quality accounting standards, and we look forward to providing further assistance to the FASB as it continues its re-deliberations of the insurance contracts proposal.\u201d"}
