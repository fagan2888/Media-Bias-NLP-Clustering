At least seven troops and four gunmen have been killed in the fighting so far.\n\nOn Sunday, Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi told reporters that the last two gunmen had been cornered on the large base and would be \u201cneutralized\u201d soon.\n\nThe attack on the Pathankot air force base started before dawn Saturday and is seen as an attempt to undo recent improvements in the relationship between archrivals India and Pakistan. It comes a week after Narendra Modi became the first Indian prime minister in 12 years to visit Pakistan.\n\nMehrishi said Indian authorities were alerted about a potential attack in Pathankot, and that aerial surveillance at the base spotted the suspected militants as they entered the compound. He said they were engaged by Indian troops and were kept away from the base\u2019s aircraft and military equipment.\n\nA senior air force officer, Air Marshal Anil Khosla, told reporters in New Delhi that the base will not be declared fully secured until the entire area is checked by troops.\n\nSince Saturday morning, the base has been swarming with air force commandos, troops from India\u2019s elite National Security Guard and local police, but officials refused to say how many troops were involved in the fighting and combing operations.\n\nThe sprawling Pathankot air force base is spread over 25 kilometers (15 miles), including some forested sections. Defense officials would not say where on the base the fighting took place or where the suspected militants had taken cover, except to say that no aircraft or military equipment has been damaged.\n\nThe base houses a fleet of India\u2019s Russian-origin MiG-21 fighter jets and Mi-25 and Mi-35 attack helicopters, along with other military hardware.", "article_metadata": {"description": "India says search for attackers at air base still not over", "title": "India says search for attackers at air base still not over", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "India says search for attackers at air base still not over", "title": "India says search for attackers at air base still not over", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/04/india_says_search_for_attackers_at_air_base_still_not_over/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/aptopix-india-air-base-attack.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "India says search for attackers at air base still not over", "title": "India says search for attackers at air base still not over", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/aptopix-india-air-base-attack.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Channi Anand", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The sprawling Pathankot air force base is spread over 25 kilometers (15 miles), including some forested sections.\nThe attack on the Pathankot air force base started before dawn Saturday and is seen as an attempt to undo recent improvements in the relationship between archrivals India and Pakistan.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsPATHANKOT, India (AP) \u2014 Two gunmen were believed to be still on the run Monday, more than 48 hours after they and several others attacked an Indian air base near the Pakistan border.\nA senior air force officer, Air Marshal Anil Khosla, told reporters in New Delhi that the base will not be declared fully secured until the entire area is checked by troops.\nHe said they were engaged by Indian troops and were kept away from the base\u2019s aircraft and military equipment."}
