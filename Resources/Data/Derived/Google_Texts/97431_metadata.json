In fact, those rights are unalienable and \u201cshall not be infringed.\u201d\n\nThe parent of the seventh-grader who received the class assignment spoke to StoryLeak on condition of anonymity.\n\n\u201cMy son was given a workbook at school that is a compilation of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. When they covered the 2nd Amendment, he saw that they were stating that only \u2018certain guns\u2019 could be owned and that they had to be \u2018registered,\u2019 which he knew was false,\u201d the parent said. \u201cHe bought this to my attention as he felt it was wrong to teach these things that aren\u2019t true. I\u2019m extremely proud of my son for his actions.\u201d\n\nThe dad said an understanding of the Second Amendment was something he\u2019d instilled in his kids from an early age.\n\n\u201cMe and my children are active gun enthusiasts and supporters of the 2nd amendment. I have discussed the 2nd amendment with them several times and explained what it meant and its importance to our country.\u201d\n\nFallon mocks Obama in hilarious reenactment phone call with Putin\n\nBut he didn\u2019t just leave it there.\n\n\u201cI even told the school officials I talked to that you can\u2019t reword the Constitution to what you think it should be and you should only teach what it is,\u201d the parent said. \u201cWe live in a society where children are being taught to fear firearms instead of embracing them and our shooting sports. Heck 50-60 years ago you had police officers coming into schools teaching firearm safety and now we have schools teaching false information and fear. It\u2019s a sad time.\u201d\n\nLast year, a text book being used at a Texas high school claimed that the right to keep and bear arms only applied to individuals who are actively serving in a state militia.\n\nAlso last year, an Arkansas sixth grade class was invited to revise the \u201coutdated\u201d Bill of Rights.\n\nLast month, former U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens suggested revising the \u201coutdated\u201d Second Amendment to have it apply to only active militia members.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "A workbook given to a class of middle schoolers contained a blatantly inaccurate definition of the Second Amendment to the Constitution.
