Kroenke, who also owns the NFL\u2019s St. Louis Rams, was in the Show Me State to watch the Rams pick up one of their biggest victories of the season, 27-16, over New Orleans.\n\nThen he traveled back to Denver in time to see the finishing touches of the Nuggets\u2019 win over the Pelicans in person. Two games. Two wins over New Orleans.\n\nOne happy day for Kroenke.\n\nRolling to the basket. As far as Nuggets guard Ty Lawson was concerned, J.J. Hickson\u2019s 19 points and 11 rebounds against the Pelicans was built on one simple foundation \u2013 rolling to the basket on pick-and-rolls.\n\nThe two have lockers right next to each other, and after the game Lawson took full advantage of Hickson\u2019s close proximity, lightheartedly jabbing at him during his own post-game press conference.\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s not fly to roll to the basket,\u201d Lawson said, smiling. \u201cHe don\u2019t like rolling; he wants to look fly.\u201d\n\nLawson turned serious.\n\n\u201cHe played well, 19 and 11,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cHe controlled the paint, controlled the boards and we need him to do that every night.\u201d\n\nWhat did Hickson have to say about all of this?\n\n\u201cI think my percentages show that when I roll to the basket I\u2019m an effective player,\u201d Hickson said. \u201cTy does a good job finding me on the roll and puts me in a good position to score baskets.\u201d\n\nTaking the challenge. Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said he challenged his starters to raise their level of play, particularly at the beginning of games.\n\nThat message was heard loud and clear, guard Ty Lawson said.\n\n\u201cThe challenge he gave us was crazy,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cHe put everything on blast. You\u2019ve got to respond to that, being a competitor, you have to respond. We all took it to heart, we just had to get better and we did.\u201d\n\nFollow Chris Dempsey on Twitter @dempseypost or email him at cdempsey@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2013/12/15/stan-kroenke-in-the-house-in-denver-and-st-louis-to-witness-two-big-wins/9827/", "site_name": "Nuggets Ink", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog", "title": "Stan Kroenke watches Rams, Nuggets victories on Sunday"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "title": "Stan Kroenke in the house in Denver and St. Louis to witness two big wins", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/nuggets/2013/12/15/stan-kroenke-in-the-house-in-denver-and-st-louis-to-witness-two-big-wins/9827/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@dempseyPost", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "follow, all", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "J.J.
