The agency now says such a facility is still on the table, but not definite.\n\n\u201cIf a water treatment facility is decided upon, it will likely be a temporary plant,\u201d Nancy Grantham, an EPA spokeswoman, said Friday evening.\n\nThe EPA has said whatever treatment option they choose, it needs to be in place before winter when the current apparatus \u2014 several sediment ponds \u2014 will be obsolete or destroyed by the cold and snow.\n\nOfficials in Silverton and San Juan County, where the mine lies, have publicly called for a treatment facility below the Gold King and several adjacent mines, which leak hundreds of gallons of contaminated water every minute.\n\nThe EPA met with local officials Friday to discuss treatment options and how to move forward with further remediation in the area.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they know what to do at this point,\u201d said Bill Simon, a coordinator for the Animas River Stakeholders Group, which has been working on remediation solutions in the Silverton area for decades. I think that\u2019s good because it\u2019s better to try and understand it before they come up with a solution that doesn\u2019t work and spend a lot of money.\u201d\n\nSimon says locals are frustrated with the slow EPA response and feel there needs to be some immediate solution.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complex situation,\u201d Simon said.\n\nOne of the main questions is how the EPA will pay for the millions of dollars needed for work on the Gold King and other mines in San Juan County.\n\nGrantham said the EPA \u201cwill likely\u201d use Superfund appropriations for treatment at the Gold King.\n\nSuperfund sites are on the national priority list for hazardous waste cleanup.\n\nLocals have pushed back against Superfund designation for roughly two decades out of fears that it could bring stigma and damage their tourism-based economy.\n\nThe EPA says using Superfund appropriations at the site does not mean the Gold King is being put on the national priorities list.\n\n\u201cTo be on the (list), a specific process must be completed, which includes public solicitation of comments about the proposed site in the federal register,\u201d the EPA said in a statement.\n\nOfficials have said, however, they are examining Superfund designation as a potential way to fund cleanup efforts.\n\nThe EPA has been picking up a growing tab for the response to the Gold King spill, which sent wastewater cascading through three states and the land of two American Indian tribes.\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JesseAPaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "EPA: Treatment at Colorado mine spill site will cost $3 million", "title": "EPA: Treatment at Colorado mine spill site will cost $3 million", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/05/epa-treatment-at-colorado-mine-spill-site-will-cost-3-million/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150811__animas-river-colorado-mine-wastwater-leakp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150811__animas-river-colorado-mine-wastwater-leakp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-05T17:26:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T22:04:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Animas River-Spill"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca382\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf a water treatment facility is decided upon, it will likely be a temporary plant,\u201d Nancy Grantham, an EPA spokeswoman, said Friday evening.\nFederal environmental officials estimate it will cost about $3 million to set up and operate a temporary water treatment system for a year at the leaching Gold King Mine above Silverton.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency told The Denver Post on Friday it is still \u201cevaluating treatment options\u201d at the site where the agency spilled 3 million gallons of contaminants Aug. 5.\nGrantham said the EPA \u201cwill likely\u201d use Superfund appropriations for treatment at the Gold King.\nThe EPA says using Superfund appropriations at the site does not mean the Gold King is being put on the national priorities list."}
