Her two sons Tommy, 9, and Alex, 4, were laughing side-by-side going around as Tommy successfully grabbed Alex\u2019s hand.\n\nKellie said it was their second year attending the event, which ran from noon to 5 p.m. with the duck drop at 4. She brought her kids out to watch the duck race and to play on the rides.\n\n\u201cI love it,\u201d Kellie said. \u201cWe have a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nTommy said his favorite attractions were the bounce houses because \u201cyou get to slide and bounce.\u201d\n\nIn the event\u2019s past 17 years, the fundraiser has generated more than $600,000.\n\nPrevious beneficiaries have included Easter Seals/Capper Foundation, Children\u2019s Miracle Network, The Villages, the Marian Clinic, Meals on Wheels and Head Start programs.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Corey Jones", "og": {"url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2013-09-07/duck-race-goes-down-wire-nearly-12000-adopted", "site_name": "CJOnline.com", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/12603886.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Duck race goes down to wire; nearly 12,000 adopted"}, "description": "While it was unknown if the feathered fowl in the annual Great Topeka Duck Race had undergone testing for performance enhancers this year, it was clear Saturday afternoon that none of the participants would be strong enough to break free of the large flock.Aboard the floating dock that the ducks were slowly pushing toward as they struggled with a cross wind on Lake Shawnee, volunteers discussed how in most years there are one or two swimmers that definitively leave behind their 12,000 cohorts in a dash to the finish."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2792\"", "article_summary": "She brought her kids out to watch the duck race and to play on the rides.\nNot so Saturday afternoon at the 18th annual event, which saw all but 40 of the 12,000 ducks adopted out for the benefit race.\nWhile it was unknown if the feathered fowl in the annual Great Topeka Duck Race had undergone testing for performance enhancers this year, it was clear Saturday afternoon that none of the participants would be strong enough to break free of the large flock.\nOther prizes included:\u25a0 Second place \u2014 52 movie passes at Hollywood Theaters, Topeka.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great cause and it all goes back to the community.\u201dBeach thought the crowd was \u201cpretty good\u201d given the scorching temperatures."}
