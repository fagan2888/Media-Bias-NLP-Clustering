Whether prices rebound or not is bound to have a similar impact this year. Prices shot up briefly on Monday as investors worried about a potential supply disruption as a result of heightened tensions between oil producers Saudi Arabia and Iran, but weak economic data from China erased the gains.\n\nSo which direction will prices go from here? Will concerns about demand from China and other weakened economies combine with an ongoing supply glut to further drive down crude futures?\n\nPhil Flynn, senior energy analyst at The PRICE Futures Group, lays out a bullish case \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t just rest on crisis in the Middle East.\n\nHis argument that prices will rise after two down years starts with reasons that the global oil glut might be curtailed. For one thing, producers are pulling back in response to lower prices. \u201cThe Wall Street Journal is reporting that Tudor, Pickering & Holt, an energy-focused investment bank, has tallied 150 projects that have been delayed, resulting in an estimated 13 million barrels a day of oil production deferred indefinitely,\u201d Flynn wrote to clients on Thursday, noting that the crude that isn\u2019t flowing represents 15 percent of total global output.\n\nRelated: Why Oil Prices Could Really Collapse to $20 a Barrel in 2016\n\n\u201cCapital spending cuts as well as the normal rate of production decline is hitting the market,\u201d the analyst says.\n\nAnd the added supply expected from Iran might not materialize, he adds. The U.S. is now considering imposing more sanctions on Iran, which could spell trouble for the return of Iran\u2019s oil to the market \u2014 though tensions with Saudi Arabia could also mean that the two countries won\u2019t work in concert to limit production.\n\nFlynn argues that, when Iran does eventually re-enter the market, there will be questions as to how much oil it can produce consistently given a lack of investment in its oil fields. On top of that, he doesn\u2019t believe that Saudi Arabia is going to produce much more oil next year than it has this year. \u201cThey say they\u2019ll add more, but how much more can they? How much more could they add?\u201d Flynn says.\n\nRelated: As OPEC Loses Control, There\u2019s a New Power in the Oil Market\n\nAlso, production from other OPEC countries might fall. Producers in Venezuela, Mexico, Algeria and Nigeria are postponing projects that are necessary to reverse the natural depletion of oil fields and even though production is improving in Libya, Flynn questions how sustainable it is due to the volatile political situation there.\n\nOn the other side of the supply/demand equation, the consumption of gasoline in the U.S. is rising sharply. Demand for gas grew at the highest rate in 30 years, Flynn says, while global demand growth was the strongest in over a decade.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve priced in weaker demand than we think [exists],\u201d Flynn says.\n\nFlynn predicts that next year will see an even greater jump in demand and it\u2019ll become the driving force that pushes gas prices up from their current average of $2 a gallon to around $2.25 by April.\n\nFlynn likens the current situation to the last time oil had back-to-back losing years, which was in 1997 and 1998, when prices fell over 30 percent. The following year saw a colossal rebound as oil prices more than doubled. \u201cHistory could repeat itself,\u201d Flynn says, as \u201ccrude oil is getting ready to party like its 1999.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The plummeting prices of oil and gas roiled markets and affected businesses, investors", "title": "Why Oil Prices Will Rebound in 2016", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/04/Why-We-Can-Expect-Higher-Gas-Prices-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-gasoline-demand_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/04/Why-We-Can-Expect-Higher-Gas-Prices-2016", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-gasoline-demand_1.jpg", "creator": "@milliedent", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The plummeting prices of oil and gas roiled markets and affected businesses, investors", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The following year saw a colossal rebound as oil prices more than doubled.\nThe plummeting prices of oil and gas roiled markets and affected businesses, investors and drivers in 2015.\nHis argument that prices will rise after two down years starts with reasons that the global oil glut might be curtailed.\nRelated: Why Oil Prices Could Really Collapse to $20 a Barrel in 2016\u201cCapital spending cuts as well as the normal rate of production decline is hitting the market,\u201d the analyst says.\nRelated: As OPEC Loses Control, There\u2019s a New Power in the Oil MarketAlso, production from other OPEC countries might fall."}
