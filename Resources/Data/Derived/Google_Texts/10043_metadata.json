Your nephew Trevor won't stop spouting vapid Democratic talking points in favor of Obamacare.\n\nWhen Thanksgiving talk turns political, do you feel like you and your liberal relatives can't communicate?\n\nIt's okay. I can help you. I was born in Greenwich Village to a lawyer dad and community-organizer mom. I used to live on Capitol Hill, and now I live in Montgomery County in Maryland. I even served a year as an MSNBC contributor. This is all to say, I speak liberal.\n\nYou won\u2019t win over your lefty in-laws with appeals to liberty. Those warnings about hubris that tickle your Edmund Burke nerve will ring hollow with Nephew Trevor, who is still infected with his 2008 case of Hope & Change. You need to speak their language.So let me offer my conservative and libertarian readers the first annual Thanksgiving Guide to Making Conservative Arguments in Liberals\u2019 Language.\n\nRegulators will ban your organic kale.\n\nYour liberal relatives generally trust government regulations to solve problems. They don\u2019t sweat the costs to the economy as much as you do. Throw in a healthy distrust of Corporate America \u2014 often even an unhealthy disdain for it \u2014 and progressives (this is what they call themselves these days) end up regarding regulation as a force for good.\n\nYou can plant a seed of skepticism about regulators\u2019 ability to do good, though, by pointing to the salad course Trevor brought. The organic, local, sustainable kale in it might be impossible to get after the Obama administration\u2019s food safety rules go into effect.\n\nThe Food Safety Modernization Act that Obama signed is finally being implemented, and it has locavores up in arms. Quote Nathanael Johnson at Grist (your relatives know this site): \u201cEveryone wants safer food, but some small farmers fear the rules could force them out of business.\u201d\n\nProposed federal rules on manure-spreading and water-testing seem tailored for industrial farming, impossible for smaller farms to meet. As you discuss this, throw in references to author Michael Pollan.\n\nAt work here are two dynamics common to regulation: They\u2019re called \u201cregulatory capture\u201d and \u201cthe overhead smash.\u201d\n\nObama's food safety czar is Michael Taylor, former top lobbyist for Monsanto. (You'll be amazed at the power of the word \u201cMonsanto\u201d with some of your relatives.) Industrial farms and major food processors hire the best lobbyists and thus get a seat at the table when the FDA writes the rules. Thus, the biggest players in the regulated industry have \u201ccaptured\u201d the agency that regulates them.\n\n\u201cThe overhead smash\u201d is my phrase for the tendency of regulations to add to overhead \u2014 the fixed costs of doing business \u2014 which smashes smaller competitors while protecting the big guys. In the food safety realm, small farms are begging to be exempted from these rules that only big farms can afford.\n\nIn case your aunts think this is an aberration, point them to similar phenomena in the realms of handmade toys, taxi services, bakers, hair-braiders, casket-makers and so on.
