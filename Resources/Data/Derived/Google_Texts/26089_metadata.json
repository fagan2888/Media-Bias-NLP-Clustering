Thankfully, its stay will be short-lived and harmless to other New Yorkers.\n\nOn the eve of winter storm Jonas, Jan. 22, the New York State Department of Health announced the discovery of three Zika cases within the state, each contracted during travel to endemic countries. Of the three, one has fully recovered already, while the other two are doing so without any complications. All of the patients tested positive for the virus's presence.\n\n\"There is virtually no risk of acquiring Zika virus in New York State at this time as the virus cannot be spread by casual contact with an infected person and mosquitoes are not active in cold winter months,\" said DOH Commissioner Howard Zucker in a statement released by the DOH. \"But since this is a time of year when people travel to warmer climates and countries where Zika virus is found, we are urging residents, especially pregnant women, to check all health advisories before traveling and take preventive measures when traveling to affected countries.\"\n\nCompared to more infamous mosquito-borne diseases, like malaria or dengue, Zika is low-key. Only 20 percent of infected individuals present any symptoms at all, such as rash or fever, and even then it is typically mild.\n\nRecently, however, Zika has received a torrent of attention from public health officials across the world after an outbreak in Brazil last year was linked to an uptick of birth defects among its pregnant sufferers. Thousands of Brazilian babies are known to have come down with microcephaly, or unusually small heads, in the wake of the outbreak, a sharp increase from the hundred or so cases that normally occur annually. Smaller outbreaks elsewhere have been tied to the development of neurological complications in very rare cases among both adults and the very young.\n\nBecause Zika outbreaks are known to spread rapidly once they're established and there is, at present, no treatment or vaccine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised that pregnant women delay traveling to countries where the virus is regularly found. On Friday, the list expanded to nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador, and Samoa. Any pregnant women who have recently traveled and come down with Zika-like symptoms are advised to receive blood testing for Zika as well.\n\nThe three NY patients are believed to be from Queens in New York City, Nassau County, and Orange County, respectively.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "zika virus, mosquito-borne, no risk", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The Zika virus has been found in three NY State residents, health officials reported Friday.", "title": "New York Patients Test Positive For Zika Virus", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/zika-virus-new-york-state-370720", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/24/aedes-mosquito.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Zika virus has been found in three NY State residents, health officials reported Friday.", "title": "New York Patients Test Positive For Zika Virus", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/zika-virus-new-york-state-370720", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/24/aedes-mosquito.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/01/24/aedes-mosquito.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-01-24T13:11:53-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-24T13:11:52-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The Zika virus has been found in three NY State residents, health officials reported Friday."}, "article_summary": "The mosquito-borne Zika virus has decided to visit the Big Apple.\nAny pregnant women who have recently traveled and come down with Zika-like symptoms are advised to receive blood testing for Zika as well.\nOn the eve of winter storm Jonas, Jan. 22, the New York State Department of Health announced the discovery of three Zika cases within the state, each contracted during travel to endemic countries.\nThe three NY patients are believed to be from Queens in New York City, Nassau County, and Orange County, respectively.\n\"There is virtually no risk of acquiring Zika virus in New York State at this time as the virus cannot be spread by casual contact with an infected person and mosquitoes are not active in cold winter months,\" said DOH Commissioner Howard Zucker in a statement released by the DOH."}
