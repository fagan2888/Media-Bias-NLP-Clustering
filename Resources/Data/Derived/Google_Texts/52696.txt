Firefighters in Dallas battled a three-alarm fire at a large warehouse off Interstate 30 late Friday.

The fire reportedly began about 11:40 p.m. at the U.S. Postal Service’s distribution center on I-30, between Hampton Road and Westmoreland Road.

Fire investigators determined something caught fire on a conveyor belt, causing smaller fires as the belt moved through the building, Dallas Fire-Rescue spokesman Jason Evans said in news release.

“As the belt continued traveling through the facility, pieces fell from it and subsequently started several small fires that also had to be extinguished,” Evans said.

The 115 people inside the facility evacuated unharmed, while 54 firefighters responded to the fire.

One firefighter was taken to a hospital after he slipped and fell while working. The injury was minor, Evans said.

The fire was ruled accidental.
