On the surface, it was because it played into the stereotype that Apple lays claim to everyday inspirations. But on a deeper level it traces back to former CEO Steve Jobs, who famously said in 2007 at the initial iPhone reveal, \u201cWho wants a stylus? You have to get em\u2019, put em\u2019 away. You lose them. Yuck.\u201d Yet it turns out that eight years later, some people do want a stylus \u2014 and they\u2019ve improved substantially alongside the devices with which they\u2019re used.\n\nStill, the online snark was immediate. \u201cApple just announced a product that Steve Jobs famously hated,\u201d wrote Business Insider. ABC compiled the internet\u2019s best reactions to the product reveal including a rather clever stab from Grand Slam supplier Denny\u2019s, which announced its \u201cToothpick\u201d product alongside the tagline, \u201cyour teeth, performing at full potential.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s missing from the reactions is the obvious acknowledgment that Jobs was not only talking about using a stylus with an entirely different product \u2014 the 3.5-inch iPhone 1 \u2014 but he was referring to both styluses and screens that have been blown out of the water by newer technology.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n###", "article_metadata": {"description": "SAN FRANCISCO (TheVerge.com) -- When Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller announced that the company's stylus for new iPad Pro would be called Pencil, the crowd", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "BlackPressUSA", "description": "Nick Statt, THE VERGE \u00a0 SAN FRANCISCO\u00a0(TheVerge.com) -- When Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller announced that the\u00a0company's stylus for new iPad Pro would be called Pencil, the crowd audibly laughed in unison.
