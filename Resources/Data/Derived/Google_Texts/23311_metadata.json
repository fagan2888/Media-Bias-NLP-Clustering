But authorities say the 54-year-old was reaching for a gun during the confrontation.\n\nAt the funeral, Finicum's family drew on their faith and quoted scripture in describing their father as a man of conviction and courage.\n\nOne daughter, Thara Thenney, said her father was \"defiled, mocked and eventually slain.\"\n\n\"He had never, not once, abandoned his trust in the Lord,\" she said.\n\nA man in the funeral crowd shouted out \"murder.\"\n\nThe funeral was held inside a Mormon church, but national leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints last month denounced the armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and said they were \"deeply troubled\" by reports the occupiers were using scriptural principles to justify it.\n\nAmmon Bundy \u2014 a Mormon and the main leader of the refuge occupation \u2014has said he was following divine orders when he and his followers seized the refuge Jan. 2. Bundy demanded the government change federal land policies and free two ranchers imprisoned for setting fires.\n\nBundy is among 12 people in custody for their involvement in the ongoing occupation outside Burns, Oregon. Bundy and four others were arrested during the Jan. 26 confrontation that left Finicum dead.\n\nFederal prosecutors say Bundy's group brandished firearms to keep officials from carrying out their duties, threatened violence and intimidated locals.\n\nFour occupiers remain holed up at the refuge, refusing to leave without assurances they won't be arrested \u2014 an unlikely prospect since they are among 16 people named in a federal grand jury indictment.\n\nHundreds of people from across the country packed the church for Finicum's funeral. Trucks with American flags filled the parking lot. One had a flier with a picture of Finicum and the words, \"Murdered by the FBI.\"\n\n\"He's a hero to me, honest. His heart is for everybody,\" said former occupier Ben Matthews of Port Huron, Michigan, who came to Kanab to pay his respects.\n\nAlso at the funeral was Ammon Bundy's father, Cliven, a Nevada rancher who was at the center of a 2014 armed standoff with federal authorities over grazing rights on government land.\n\nThe day's events in this town just north of the Arizona border were billed as \"LaVoy Finicum's Stand for Freedom.\"\n\nAfter the funeral, people lined the streets as dozens of riders on horseback paraded past. They followed a riderless horse.\n\nSheriff's officials and the Utah Highway Patrol were on hand to ensure the events were peaceful. Given the anti-government sentiment that was expected among the crowd, local law enforcement agencies pleaded with the FBI and other federal agents to stay away.\n\nOf the 16 Bundy followers charged with felony conspiracy, only three have been allowed to leave jail ahead of trial. They include Shawna Cox, who was in Finicum's truck when he was shot.\n\nJust hours before the funeral, a federal judge in Portland allowed Cox to attend the ceremony in her hometown but ordered her not to discuss the standoff.\n\n___\n\nPetty reported from Portland, Oregon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "During Utah funeral, Oregon refuge occupier hailed as a hero - AP News: KANAB, Utah (AP) \u2014 Inside a packed Mormon church in .05/27/2016 6:31:31AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "KANAB, Utah (AP) \u2014 Inside a packed Mormon church in this desert town Friday, a", "title": "AP News - During Utah funeral, Oregon refuge occupier hailed as a hero", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/religion/2016/02/05/funeral-to-draw-large-crowd-in-support-of-oregon-occupier-n2115382", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016\\36\\d67692d9-cefe-49dc-90dc-241b1eff04fe.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "KANAB, Utah (AP) \u2014 Inside a packed Mormon church in this desert town Friday, a", "title": "AP News - During Utah funeral, Oregon refuge occupier hailed as a hero", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/religion/2016/02/05/funeral-to-draw-large-crowd-in-support-of-oregon-occupier-n2115382", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/36/d67692d9-cefe-49dc-90dc-241b1eff04fe.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "During Utah funeral, Oregon refuge occupier hailed as a hero, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "At the funeral, Finicum's family drew on their faith and quoted scripture in describing their father as a man of conviction and courage.\nHundreds of people from across the country packed the church for Finicum's funeral.\nAmmon Bundy \u2014 a Mormon and the main leader of the refuge occupation \u2014has said he was following divine orders when he and his followers seized the refuge Jan. 2.\nJust hours before the funeral, a federal judge in Portland allowed Cox to attend the ceremony in her hometown but ordered her not to discuss the standoff.\nBundy is among 12 people in custody for their involvement in the ongoing occupation outside Burns, Oregon."}
