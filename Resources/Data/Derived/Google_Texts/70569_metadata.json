Titled \u201cRethink what you \u2018know\u2019 about high-achieving women,\u201d the piece presents the results of a survey of more than 25,000 graduates of Harvard Business School. The authors focused mostly on the MBAs between the ages of 26 and 67. They wanted to know if they could discover anything new about the gender gap in leadership.\n\nWhy do women end up rising to less impressive positions in the workplace than their male counterparts? It is happening even among the elite graduates of Harvard Business School. What\u2019s that about?\n\nThere is a popular narrative: Women are \u201copting out\u201d when they should be \u201cleaning in.\u201d They\u2019re choosing the mommy track over the rule-the-world career track. But that\u2019s not what the authors found. As they noted, with emphasis, \u201cOnly 11% are out of the workforce to care for children full-time.\u201d They pin the gender differential in powerful workplace positions on different dynamics, which you can read about in their article or in the Times article, \u201cEven among Harvard graduates, women fall short of their work expectations.\u201d\n\nWhat I care about here is what the study authors, the Harvard Business Review, and the New York Times apparently do not care about \u2013 anyone who is not married, especially if they are not in the category of married with children.\n\nIn the HBR article, we learn all about women\u2019s and men\u2019s expectations about whose career will be dominant within a marriage and who will end up doing most of the childcare. We also learn whose career within a marriage really does end up dominant and who ends up doing the most childcare. But we learn nothing about women \u2013 or men \u2013 who are not married and who do not have children.\n\nThe authors tell us that among the 32-67 year olds in their research, 83% were married. They don\u2019t reveal the same figures for the younger participants. I don\u2019t know the nationwide percentage of married people just for the 32-67 year-old demographic, but for everyone 18 and older it is much lower, about 56%. Still, even if 83% of the entire sample of 25,000+ HBS graduates (and not just the older people) had been married, that still means ignoring more than 4,250 people.\n\nThe authors are sensitive to other potential biases and isms. They realize they are discussing an elite group, and address that head-on. They are also careful about clarifying whether their results differ for different racial/ethnic groups. We all know about racism and classism, white privilege and economic privilege. But singlism \u2013 the stereotyping, stigmatizing, and discrimination against single people \u2013 is hardly recognized at all. And the set of privileges that come with being married (such as having your life considered important enough to be analyzed and discussed thoughtfully and respectfully in the HBR and the New York Times) apparently merit not even a nod.\n\nConsider the title of the HBS article: \u201cRethink what you \u2018know\u2019 about high-achieving women.\u201d But the article is not about high-achieving women; it is about high-achieving women who are married with children. The same is true of the article in the New York Times. It came with the heading, \u201cEven among Harvard graduates, women fall short of their work expectations.\u201d\n\nWhen I first started out in academic psychology, back in the Stone Age, we could write articles that were only about men, for example, or only about white people, and never acknowledge that our results only apply to men or to white people. That\u2019s not allowed anymore. Professionals are not supposed to disappear huge swaths of the human population, or pretend that the experiences of some people are representative of all people, or that the only experiences that matter are, for instance, those of white men. With singles, though, in the 21st century, it is still fair game to set them all aside with not even a shrug.\n\nNever mind the singlism and the insensitivity to matters of privilege inherent in that practice. Ignoring single people is counterproductive to the ostensible goals of the authors. If they want to know why women do not ascend to the same positions of power in the workplace as men do, aren\u2019t the experiences of single women (and men) relevant, too? If, for example, single women are also underrepresented in the most prestigious and powerful positions in business and industry, then doesn\u2019t that tell us that something else is going on beyond the dynamics of equality in marriages?\n\n[Note: For translations of some of my books into other languages, such as Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, and Korean, click here.
