If Manning was the quarterback, I could coach the Broncos and they would go no worse than 10-6 and reach the playoffs.\n\nKlis: What do you want to do against the Chargers this week, Peyton?\n\nManning: I think we should (football gibberish, X\u2019s, O\u2019s, gibberish, gibberish).\n\nKlis: OK, Peyton, do you think maybe C.J. should get a few \u2026 I see. You\u2019re right, he is a good receiver out of the backfield. All right, Peyton. Make sure you tell the coaches and players what we\u2019re doing.\n\nIf Manning doesn\u2019t return, either because he\u2019s had it or doesn\u2019t think he would be a good fit in Kubiak\u2019s pocket-moving system, then it doesn\u2019t matter who coaches this team.\n\nThe Broncos are in trouble.\n\nI understand there is concern Manning is getting old and his performance is declining. But consider what the reaction would be in Kansas City, San Diego and Oakland if Manning retires.\n\nAndy Reid would do cartwheels, heaven (and earth) forbid. Mike McCoy is not exactly Mr. Excitable, but he would holler and high-five his way down the hallways at Chargers headquarters.\n\nJack Del Rio will know the 2015 Broncos better than any other opposing NFL coach save Fox, who will host his former team at Chicago\u2019s Soldier Field this fall.\n\nThink they\u2019d rather play the Broncos with Manning or without?\n\nI do think Manning is coming back. In fact, I still think he\u2019s going to play two more years.\n\nManning is a guy who writes a list and crosses things off as he goes. He has five years on his Broncos contract. Only three have been crossed off.\n\nI also don\u2019t think age, arm strength or even thigh injury were the reasons Manning went from 22 touchdown passes and three interceptions through seven games this season to 18 and 12 in the final 10. Maybe a little. But mostly I think the Broncos had a unique, fast-paced, spread-\u2019em-out offense that was unstoppable \u2014 and then defenses adjusted.\n\nI counted out Manning once before and was mistaken. I thought he was damaged goods at age 36 as he came off four neck surgeries that forced him to miss the entire 2011 season with Indianapolis.\n\nKubiak must have felt the same way, because his Houston Texans passed on pursuing the free agent Manning in March 2012.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 next head coach is going to be Kubiak, not me. But if I were him, I wouldn\u2019t count Manning out again. I\u2019d also listen to what he has to say during Chargers week.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Klis: Memo to Gary Kubiak: Peyton Manning will be your quarterback", "title": "Klis: Memo to Gary Kubiak: Peyton Manning will be your quarterback", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/17/klis-memo-to-gary-kubiak-peyton-manning-will-be-your-quarterback/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150117__broncos-kubiakp1-2.jpg", "height": 381}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150117__broncos-kubiakp1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-17T20:03:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T11:14:00+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "All things Broncos depend on Peyton Manning staying.\nIf Manning doesn\u2019t return, either because he\u2019s had it or doesn\u2019t think he would be a good fit in Kubiak\u2019s pocket-moving system, then it doesn\u2019t matter who coaches this team.\nIf Manning was the quarterback, I could coach the Broncos and they would go no worse than 10-6 and reach the playoffs.\nI do think Manning is coming back.\nManning: I think we should (football gibberish, X\u2019s, O\u2019s, gibberish, gibberish)."}
