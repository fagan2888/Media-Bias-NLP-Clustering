'We really didn't care for a PR pitch about how the administration is trying to salvage its internal health care tech nightmare.'\n\nOne executive said that meeting participants were dead-set against straying from the principal focus of the meeting \u2013 the uncomfortable and legally untenable position they are in when the National Security Agency demands access to their digital records.\n\nThe White House said in advance that the meeting would include a discussion of healthcare.gov, but the company executive said the only subject that mattered to the participants was the NSA.\n\n'He basically hijacked the meeting,' the executive said. 'We all told the White House that we were only there to talk about what the NSA was up to and how it affects us.'\n\n\n\nAll smiles: Obama joked with tech executives before focusing on Obamacare and relegating the companies' NSA concerns to second-tier status\n\nYet Obama, according to insiders, repeatedly peppered the discussion with reassuring words about how the Affordable Care Act's marquee website was well on its way to becoming functional.\n\n\n\nThe change was so noticeable that an AFP/Getty photographer assigned to cover the event noted in a photo caption only that Obama was there to 'meet with executives from leading tech companies to discuss progress with healthcare.gov.'\n\n\n\nOne executive of a company represented at the meeting told The Guardian that a change of focus 'is not going to happen. We are there to talk about the NSA.'\n\nAnother said issues other than intelligence agencies' snooping are 'peripheral.'\n\nThe unnamed business leader told the paper that 'there's only one subject that people really want to discuss right now.'\n\nThe 15 companies, including Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft, Netflix, Twitter, Apple and Etsy, issued a one-line joint statement after the 150-minute marathon meeting in the White House's Roosevelt Room, saying that they 'appreciated the opportunity to share directly with the president our principles on government surveillance that we released last week and we urge him to move aggressively on reform.'\n\nThere was no mention in the statement of healthcare.gov.\n\nHands on the table, Joe: Vice President Biden was seated next to one of the meeting's few female participants, Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer. Biden made headlines yesterday for his roving paws at a holiday party\n\nA serious matter: Reporters on Tuesday put White House press secretary Jay Carney on the spot about about a federal judge who declared that the NSA's bulk collection of millions of Americans' telephone records is unconstitutional\n\nBut in its statement to reporters about the meeting, the White House played up the significance of focusing portions of the get-together on how to fix the government's disastrous health insurance website.\n\nObama and the executives 'discussed a number of issues ... including the progress being made to improve performance and capacity issues with heathcare.gov,' the statement began.\n\nAfter announcing a changing of the guard in the push to repair the site, the White House noted that '[f]inally, the group discussed the national security and economic impacts of unauthorized intelligence disclosures.'\n\nA group of eight tech companies, including some in attendance on Tuesday, asked Obama last week for an overhaul of the surveillance laws that govern the NSA.\n\n'The balance in many countries has tipped too far in favor of the state and away from the rights of the individual \u2013 rights that are enshrined in our Constitution,\" they wrote in an open letter to the president.\n\nDistraction: Obama took time out from the supposedly NSA-focused meeting to announce that Jeff Zients (L) would be replaced as his healthcare website czar\n\nA federal judge ruled Monday that their concerns about government spy programs are well-founded.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon declared that the NSA's broad seizures of telecommunications companies' call records violate the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. That provision protects Americans from unreasonable searches.\n\nThe ruling is already being seen as partial validation for the exiled leaker Edward Snowden, who exposed details of the NSA's huge data collection program to the public this year.\n\n'I have significant doubts about the efficacy of the metadata collection program as a means of conducting time-sensitive investigations in cases involving imminent threats of terrorism,' the judge wrote in his ruling.\n\n'I cannot imagine a more \u2018indiscriminate\u2019 and \u2018arbitrary invasion\u2019 than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying it and analyzing it without judicial approval.'\n\n\n\nIn Tuesday's meeting, Yahoo! CEO Marissa Meyer was seated next to Vice President Joe Biden, whose wandering hands were the subject of nationwide jokes on Monday.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Obama,hijacks,tech,executive,meeting,changes,subject,NSA,surveillance,healthcare,gov,fixes", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2525447/Obama-hijacks-tech-executive-meeting-changes-subject-NSA-surveillance-healthcare-gov-fixes.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "'That wasn't what we came for,' one tech VP said.
