REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/Files\n\n4114425\n\nAlthough nearly two of every three babies aborted is not white, the pro-life movement is constantly tarred as \u201cracist\u201d for trying to save their lives.\n\nThis week Michelle Colon, an abortion facility escort, told the Huffington Post that the mostly white sidewalk counselors outside her office \u201csay some of the most disgusting, degrading, and racist comments to\u201d black women, telling them they may be \u201ckilling the dream, killing the next Barack Obama, the next Martin Luther King.\u201d\n\nComplimenting their offspring seems like a peculiar form of hatred. Wouldn\u2019t a racist go out of his way not to save black children? Those actually involved in the white racialist movement seem to think so.\n\n\u201cMy attitude about abortion, to put it in the most provocative way is this: I think that some abortions should be illegal, I think other abortions should be mandatory,\u201d said Greg Johnson of the white nationalist website Counter-Currents Publishing in a 2012 interview discussing his article on \u201cfascist medicine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think any miscegenated baby \u2026 yeah, Hell yeah, I would make that mandatory,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in cases where the child has severe birth defects,\u201d such as Down syndrome, because demanding child care may prevent parents from \u201chaving other children who could be normal.\u201d\n\nThe white racialist publication Instauration \u2013 the magazine that got Joe Sobran in trouble at National Review \u2013 supported forced abortion in the mid-1990s, writing, \u201cMuch as the West hates to face it, the Chinese are absolutely correct in their compulsory population control measures.\u201d Conversely, the theme of last year\u2019s Canadian March for Life was ending China\u2019s practice of gendercide.\n\nWhen racialists don\u2019t support coercion, they believe in liberalizing abortion law. Jared Taylor, the leader of \u201crace realists\u201d at American Renaissance wrote that, to shrink the underclass, public school \u201cstudents should get sex education, free contraceptives, and free abortions.\u201d\n\nThese sentiments would have more in common with Planned Parenthood\u2019s founders. Dr. Alan Guttmacher, founder of the Guttmacher Institute and onetime president of Planned Parenthood-World Population, was vice president of the American Eugenics Association. Margaret Sanger supported eugenics and, perhaps not coincidentally, once gave a speech to the women\u2019s auxiliary of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nOn the other hand, the pro-life movement seeks to save all babies, regardless of race or ethnicity. And statistics show most babies aborted are black or Hispanic.\n\n\u201cThe typical abortion patient these days is a twenty-something single mother of color,\u201d Amanda Marcotte wrote in the American Prospect.\n\nAccording to the CDC\u2019s abortion statistics for 2010, \u201cNon-Hispanic white women had the lowest abortion rates,\u201d accounting for 36.8 percent of all abortions, \u201cwhereas non-Hispanic black women had the highest.\u201d\n\nHow high? More blacks are aborted than were lynched in all of U.S. history every six weeks, in New York City alone.\n\nThis means the pro-life movement, which Colon classifies as primarily white, is working to increase the size and potential political power of the black community.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ben Johnson", "description": "More black babies are aborted in New York City every six weeks than were lynched in the rest of U.S. history.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Although nearly two of every three babies aborted is not white, the pro-life movement is constantly tarred as \u201cracist\u201d for trying to save their lives.
