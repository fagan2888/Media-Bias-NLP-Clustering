Obamacare. Russia. The NSA. Wealth disparity. Immigration reform. Gun control. What do all of these hot issues for the 2016 election have in common? None of them matter because we\u2019re all going to die,\u201d says the home page at IWillNotDoNothing.com, the campaign website of Mikelis Beitiks, 32.\n\n\u201cEvery forecast on climate change predicts severe consequences without dramatic measures. And yet, federal legislators do essentially nothing,\u201d the Democrat wrote. \u201cIn light of this, I offer myself as a candidate for U.S. Senate. If elected, I vow to address global warming like a human being with basic reasoning and any sense of proportion.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the basic pitch:\n\nBeitiks on Tuesday published an open letter to Boxer (on letterhead emblazoned \u201cFrom the Dining Room Table That Doubles as the Desk of Mike Beitiks\u201d) thanking her for her service, particularly her work to combat climate change.\n\n\u201cIn your 32 years on the Hill, you have undoubtedly formed bulletproof alliances, banked countless favors, and compiled mountains of insider knowledge. Imagine the possibilities if, to save future generations of Americans, you torch all of that in your final year of service,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHear me out here \u2013 You don\u2019t have to worry about re-election, and you never have to work with these people again. This is freedom that could change the world.\u201d\n\nBeitiks then proceeds to urge Boxer to \u201cabandon courtesy, call in favors without mercy, blackmail \u2013 stuff like that\u201d to force the Senate to approve the most ambitious climate treaty possible when President Obama goes to Paris in November for the United Nations Climate Conference.\n\n\u201cThen, filibuster all legislation that makes its way up into the Senate until concrete solutions on climate change are created in the house,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSure, you\u2019ll get roasted in the media for it, but so what? In 15 short months, you\u2019ll be retired and off the grid \u2013 daiquiris, Grafton and sandy toes in Aruba, popsicle-blue surf shushing the stateside wonk jibber-jabber.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd, you know, I\u2019m just spit-balling now, but the next time a fellow Senator says something untrue or unproductive about climate change, consider slugging him/her,\u201d he continued. \u201cImagine how you\u2019d change the national conversation with a well-placed right hook! Squaring up would be ideal, but a sucker-punch would work, particularly as a metaphor.\u201d\n\nBeitiks said Wednesday he\u2019s a stay-at-home father of two who realized in January, when Attorney General Kamala Harris declared her candidacy to succeed Boxer, that she\u2019s \u201ca very qualified candidate and I\u2019d be very excited if she got elected\u201d yet she lacks a strong platform position on climate change.\n\nGiven that he has \u201ca certain amount of unresolved anxiety\u201d about the climate-change crisis, he said dryly, \u201cIt seemed like a reasonable avenue to offer myself as an idiot with a bulletproof premise \u2026 an act of political self-immolation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know a lot of people feel this strongly about it \u2013 that\u2019s the response I\u2019ve been getting to the campaign so far,\u201d he added.\n\nRead more about Beitik\u2019s quixotic campaign, after the jump\u2026\n\n\n\nHis letter to Boxer this week is the latest salvo in a campaign that has gotten attention in recent months from MSNBC, Grist, The Awl and other media outlets.\n\n\u201cLet it first be said that I am not a scientist, or an engineer, or a time-traveler, or whatever the kind of person is who will hands-on actually fix this problem,\u201d Beitiks wrote on his website\u2019s \u201cqualifications\u201d page. \u201cHowever, I am someone willing to use every single government resource you grant to my discretion or indiscretion to get the right people in the right positions to stop us all from dying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am totally willing to make mistakes. Huge mistakes. I don\u2019t care about re-election, and I believe that when it comes to preserving life on earth as we know it, an honest mistake is better than a dishonest anything.\u201d\n\nBeitiks also offers a platform entitled \u201cThings I Will Do That Are Not Nothing,\u201d including greatest hits such as:\n\n\u201cTake all of the rich people\u2019s money, put it toward fighting climate change. Then, take all of the poor people\u2019s money, put that toward fighting climate change. Basically, nobody gets money anymore until no more climate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cCutting down a tree will now be called \u2018arbortion.\u2019 You can\u2019t perform an arbortion unless the government says it\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithdraw military from Middle East. Deploy military in people\u2019s driveways to make sure they\u2019re not taking unnecessary trips, driving when they could be walking, etc\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOn a related note, probably no private cars, period. Not like socialism, per se, but like a species that wants to survive, per se.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo more daylight savings time. Actually, whenever it\u2019s dark, it\u2019s just going to be dark. Welcome to the real world.\u201d\n\n\u201cSchools will no longer teach any subjects other than Earth Sciences and Math. The rest of the time, kids will be forced to brainstorm ways we can stop climate change. In the dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop Volcanoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cFilibuster all legislation from any party that does not address climate change until we have a plan in place, and advocate for widespread amendments to the Constitution that will enable some pretty serious changes in the way we do things around here.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Political Blotter", "description": "A San Francisco attorney\u2019s guerrilla campaign to succeed Barbara Boxer in the U.S. Senate rests upon a laser-like focus on combating climate change and a hefty dose of sarcastic humor. \u201cISIS.
