Based on 2012-13 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, Georgia has three of the top 10 shrinking cities in the United States. All are south of I-20:\n\nNo. 1: Valdosta (-2.12 percent; current population 56,481)\n\nNo. 4: Albany (- 1.42 percent, current population 76,185)\n\nNo. 7 Macon (-1.31 percent, current population 89,981)\n\nSee the chartage here. Two of the three Georgia cities are, proportionately, shedding more people than Detroit, which came in at No. 6. (Hat tip to PeachPundit.com on this.)\n\n***\n\nKaren Handel this morning announced she would back trucking executive Mike Collins in the 10th Congressional District GOP runoff. The U.S. Senate race also-ran, via press release:\n\n\u201cMike is a conservative who does more than just talk. He actually walks the walk. Mike has an actual plan to pay down our national debt, cut wasteful spending and eliminate job-killing regulations by implementing conservative policies.\u201d\n\nOne can\u2019t help but think that the above quote is mere window dressing, and that Handel couldn\u2019t bring herself to endorse Collins\u2019 opponent, who in 2004 was quoted thusly in the Athens Banner-Herald:\n\n\u201dIf the woman\u2019s within the authority of her husband, I don\u2019t see a problem,\u201d Dr. Jody Hice of the Bethlehem First Baptist church in Barrow County said of women in positions of political power.\n\nHice, meanwhile, is getting $4,600 worth in direct-mail help from the National Association for Gun Rights, a group that thinks the NRA compromises too much.\n\n***\n\nThe 11th District runoff between former congressman Bob Barr of Smyrna and former state senator Barry Loudermilk of Cassville is taking a decidedly geographic turn.\n\nIn a pair of Jon Gillooly profiles, Loudermilk told the Marietta Daily Journal that it may be time for U.S. House Speaker John Boehner to retire:\n\n\u201c[N]othing personal against Boehner. He\u2019s probably a great man, but I think we\u2019ve got to have some leadership. Really, the deciding factor for me was allowing the bill to give Obama the ability to raise the debt ceiling at his will without any congressional constraints whatsoever for over a year. I think that was irresponsible. That was irresponsible for the American citizens, and so it\u2019s nothing personal, I think it\u2019s just time for rotation in the leadership.\u201d\n\nBarr, who is benefitting from \u201cSave Lockheed\u201d billboards now up along I-75, warned that ticking off a U.S. House speaker is no small thing:\n\n\u201cDo we want somebody in the Congress representing the 11th District, and this applies especially to Cobb County, which if I\u2019m not back in the Congress will be the first time in decades, at least three decades, that Cobb County has not had somebody from Cobb representing them in the House of Representatives,\u201d Barr said\u2026. \u201c[O]r do they want to take a shot in the dark and send somebody up there with no experience in that arena, and who\u2019s already basically told people I\u2019m just going to be on my own up there. In other words, somebody that won\u2019t get anything done.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, an MDJ endorsement of Barr emphasized local prestige factor:\n\nThere\u2019s also the undeniable fact that if 11th [District] voters select Loudermilk, that Cobb would be without a resident in Congress for the first time since the 1960s. (Sixth District U.S. Rep. Tom Price lives in Roswell and 13th District Rep. David Scott in Atlanta). We\u2019re sure that Loudermilk would do a conscientious job of representing Cobb if elected, but there are undeniable advantages to a community to having one of its own as its representative in Washington. We doubt any Cobb-based congressman would be going out of his way to make an enemy of the House Speaker with the future of Dobbins and Lockheed on the line, for example. Bob Barr might not be a perfect candidate, but he can be counted on to work unfailingly for what\u2019s best for Cobb County and the 11th District.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem: In the May 20 primary, voters showed that the weight of the 11th District had shifted to the north. Combined, Bartow and Cherokee counties provided 29,138 ballots, or 51 percent. Cobb and a portion of Fulton accounted for 27,876.\n\nNever mind the fact that Loudermilk actually outpolled Barr in Cobb in the primary.\n\n***\n\nHere\u2019s a change-of-pace take from Chris Grant, a political science professor at Mercer University, on political experience and the GOP race for U.S. Senate between David Perdue and Jack Kingston, via Georgia Public Broadcasting:\n\n\u201cI think a lot of these folks have seen Kingston as a reliable ally, someone they owe some favors to, and right now he\u2019s cashing in on them.\u201d A counterintuitive advantage that Kingston has over Perdue, Grant said, is that Kingston\u2019s use of favors to get endorsements and contributions means that he will owe supporters favors if he makes it to the Senate. David Perdue, in contrast, is independently wealthy and is largely self-financing his campaign. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a self-funded candidate, you don\u2019t necessarily owe any favors, and that can scare people,\u201d Grant said.\n\n***\n\nBusinessman David Perdue\u2019s opponents are seizing on his pick of a role model in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe candidate, who faces U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston in the July 22 runoff, told the Marietta Daily Journal that he sees former Sen. Bill Frist as a \u201cmodel U.S. senator.\u201d\n\nOppo researchers quickly highlighted the fact that Frist said he would have voted for Obamacare and has urged the GOP to abandon its efforts to repeal the landmark healthcare bill.\n\n***\n\nConservative activist Brent Bozell\u2019s ForAmerica is attacking U.S. Senate candidate David Perdue with $50,000 worth of web ads. Send us a screenshot if you catch one.\n\nUpdate 10:25 a.m.: The Internet has spoken. Here\u2019s what ForAmerica is up to, via Jacob Hawkins and Mike Hassinger:\n\n***\n\nGov. Nathan Deal and his Democratic challenger Jason Carter traded barbs in the Opinion pages of Sunday\u2019s AJC. In case you missed it, here are some of the highlights.\n\nDeal stuck to the familiar trope of highlighting this year\u2019s increase in K-12 funding and his championing of the charter school amendment two years back. He also hinted at his second-term priorities, including an overhaul of the education funding formula:\n\n\u201cA great teacher can make all the difference, and in my second term, we\u2019ll build on our efforts to measure teacher effectiveness by rewarding our best educators and keeping them in the classroom. These efforts in the long run will improve our graduation rates, which is crucial to maintaining the skilled workforce that businesses seek\u2026.\u201d\n\nCarter battered Deal for overseeing the \u201clargest contraction of public education in our state\u2019s modern history\u201d and warned that not pumping more money into school funding could endanger Georgia\u2019s economy.\n\nHe centered on his proposal to create a separate education budget aimed at creating a separate fund free from tinkering of legislators. The Atlanta state senator introduced that proposal in January; Deal called it a political gimmick. From Carter\u2019s column:\n\n\u201cAs governor, I\u2019ll focus every day on recruiting, retaining and supporting the best possible teachers for our students. My wife Kate is a public school teacher, and I know our teachers are tired of being treated like they\u2019re the only problem instead of part of the solution. We all need to recognize that the strongest teacher workforce gives us our strongest chance to succeed\u2026.\u201d\n\n***\n\nFirst Baptist Church of Gainesville was the crossroads of Georgia\u2019s political world on Sunday morning.\n\nNot only was Gov. Nathan Deal there to urge the religious community to get involved in the third leg of his overhaul of criminal justice in Georgia, but so were several of his key appointees, including chief of staff Chris Riley and Col. Mark McDonough, who heads the Department of Public Safety.\n\nAnd standing behind Deal, in the church choir circled in blue, is a familiar face at the stat eCapitol: Harris Blackwood, head of the Governor\u2019s Office of Highway Safety. We can attest he\u2019s got quite a set of pipes.\n\n***\n\nGeorgia Democratic Party Chair DuBose Porter and First Vice Chair Nikema Williams attended a Fourth of July BBQ at the White House.
