Thursday, November 6, 2014 is now part of Star Wars history, after the title, The Force Awakens was announced in the late morning hours.\n\nAlong with the title revelation came news that principal photography for Episode VII has concluded. As it has become a custom with many breaking news, the studio used its Twitter page to let everyone know about both things, becoming the first in the franchise to do so.\n\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens has completed principal photography. #TheForceAwakens #StarWarsVII pic.twitter.com/qBhel6CDjr \u2014 Walt Disney Pictures (@DisneyPictures) November 6, 2014\n\nWhile millions of fans all over the world \u2014 along with entertainment reporters \u2014 where processing the latest news, Disney was celebrating a big pay check for the fourth quarter of 2014. During the earnings call, CEO Bob Iger presented the staggering figures, which revealed that Disney posted $12.38 billion in revenue for the period.\n\nBut we are not here to talk about how much money Disney is posting during a particular time, since most fans are not really interested in finances. One of the most noteworthy bits that came out of the call was that Iger suggested a trailer for Star Wars: The Force Awakens could premiere on TV, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n\u201cSome money has siphoned out of traditional media and into digital platforms. That said, there\u2019s still huge value in the 30-second spot.\u201d\n\nToday, most big movies debut their trailers online, making them available to many people who may be in the middle of work or school when they are released. Iger hinted that for Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Disney may go the traditional route.\n\nTalk was that a trailer could possibly be attached to the release of The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, the last installment in Peter Jackson\u2019s Middle-earth productions. After IMAX first confirmed the rumor via Twitter, only to retract a few hours later, the thought is that the teaser for Star Wars: The Force Awakens could come with Big Hero 6 \u2014 the only November release \u2014 or with Into the Woods this December.\n\nIger also confirmed what we have heard from cast member Anthony Daniels, as previously reported by the Inquisitr. In simple words, fans will be very happy with Star Wars: The Force Awakens, according to Marc Glaser from Variety.\n\n\u201cEverything suggests this will be the movie \u2018Star Wars\u2019 fans have been waiting and hoping for.\u201d\n\nThe Disney executive also stated that Star Wars: The Force Awakens \u201cexceeded the expectations we had when we made the acquisition\u201d of Lucasfilm. Are you as excited as Bob Iger about J.J. Abrams\u2019 film?\n\n[Image via Hdw]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Did you mark the date?
