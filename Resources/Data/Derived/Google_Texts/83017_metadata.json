Detectives searching his second floor home Friday found other evidence indicating Waide had access to other vehicles, Spottke said.\n\nDespite Waide\u2019s help, Porter\u2019s body has not yet been found. Waide and Porter attended the same high school and they recently reconnected on Facebook. Porter lived in Pueblo and she was last known to be visiting friends in Westminster.\n\nOne location that Westminster police may search is the Allied Waste Services Tower Road Landfill at Tower Road and 88th Avenue in Commerce City, Spottke said.\n\nEven before Waide\u2019s arrest, police contacted the landfill and asked authorities to cordon off an area where trash from the apartments where Waide lives would have been dumped following her disappearance.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a science to it,\u201d Spottke said. \u201cWe do not want trash added to that area.\u201d\n\nBefore initiating a resource intensive and expensive search of the landfill, officers want to search all other possible locations where Porter\u2019s body might be found. More than 20 police officers are working on the homicide investigation, Spottke said.\n\n\u201cI know that the family is very distraught and our ultimate goal is to bring Lea home to them,\u201d she said.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, kmitchell@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kirkmitchell", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Westminster police consider searching dump for woman\u2019s body", "title": "Westminster police consider searching dump for woman\u2019s body", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/14/westminster-police-consider-searching-dump-for-womans-body/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-14T11:16:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-14T11:16:30+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde95d\"", "article_summary": "Detectives searching his second floor home Friday found other evidence indicating Waide had access to other vehicles, Spottke said.\nDespite Waide\u2019s help, Porter\u2019s body has not yet been found.\nWaide signed a statement and is helping police find Porter\u2019s body.\nWaide is being held in the Adams County Jail for investigation of first-degree murder in the death of Lea Chali Porter.\nDetectives searching for the body of a missing 19-year-old Pueblo woman are hoping to find evidence in vehicles connected to the suspect that will lead them to her remains, authorities say."}
