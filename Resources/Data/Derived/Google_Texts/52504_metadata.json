Some of them don\u2019t know what the 18-year-old does for a living.\n\n\u201cI charge usually $160 and sometimes $200 dollars a session or sometimes an hour,\u201d she said on a recent afternoon, sitting on a bench in a Miami park.\n\nPoison Ivy is a dominatrix.\n\nSome of her clients want to have sex. For that, she charges extra. She tells the men who offer to pay a lot more if she\u2019ll have sex without a condom that she won\u2019t do it. She knows the risks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you have HIV, you don\u2019t know if I have HIV, so I\u2019d rather have sex with a condom on,\u201d she said.\n\nAlso, Poison Ivy is HIV negative. She said she gets tested regularly.\n\nHear Poison Ivy tell her story.\n\nFlorida\u2019s transgender community, specifically trans women, are among the groups most at risk of contracting HIV. It\u2019s estimated that a third of transgender women are HIV positive, according to limited studies from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nPoison Ivy said in her personal circle, she knows of at least 17 transgender women who are HIV positive.\n\nBut no one has official numbers on HIV-infection on the local, state or national levels as trans people are not really being counted. Often, trans women are incorrectly counted in categories with men who have sex with men. And few medical surveys ask people about their gender identity, making it difficult to identify and count the community in data.\n\n\u201cWe need to know people exist in order to get them funding for healthcare and the trans community is generally not counted,\u201d said Dr. Sheryl Zayas who treats HIV positive transgender women at Care Resources, an HIV/AIDS service organization in Miami Beach.\n\nZayas said transgender people are invisible in medical data and in other ways, such as in the U.S. Census which does not count them. That makes it increasingly difficult to target HIV prevention efforts at the trans community.\n\nCommunity Faces Extra Obstacles\n\nLiving as a transgender woman today means a life of discrimination, said Aryah Lester, director of Trans Miami. She calls what Poison Ivy does \u201csurvival sex work.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at it in term of survival sex work, it\u2019s the ostracism, the prejudice,\" Lester said. \u201cThat\u2019s what leads trans people to be unemployed and having no way to sustain themselves.\u201d\n\nBack at the Miami park, Poison Ivy said she\u2019s applied for a litany of jobs including Starbucks, Macy\u2019s and Burger King. But she says that after turning in her applications, she never gets a call back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard as a trans woman trying to find a job and trying to be yourself at this job,\u201d she said.\n\nPoison Ivy said sex work is what she does to get by. And while she insists her clients wear condoms, sometimes men who are paying for sex think they don\u2019t have to take no for an answer.\n\n\u201cIt was in Homestead at like 3:00 in the morning and my client like tried to basically rape me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I go get my purse and dump it out, my Taser was there. So I grabbed my Taser and I tased him.\u201d\n\nPoison Ivy recently took a test to become an HIV/AIDS tester, hoping it can help her land a job working for a nonprofit agency in HIV prevention.\n\nSex Work Not the Only Risk\n\nEconomic insecurity puts transgender women at risk far beyond doing survival sex work. Transgender people are four times as likely as the general population to be poor and can\u2019t afford many of the procedures they need to complete their transition.\n\nArianna Lint, coordinator for transgender services at SunServe, a Broward County nonprofit, is a transgender woman who\u2019s HIV positive.\n\nLint believes she became infected with HIV sharing needles while getting underground cosmetic surgeries. She says transgender women also are at risk when they share needles for hormones they purchase on the black market.\n\nShe\u2019s says systemic prejudice and lack of federal protection for transgender people has a devastating effect, pushing trans woman to underground economies.\n\n\u201cPrevention for transgender people is not giving condoms,\u201d Lint said. \u201cIt\u2019s giving opportunities.\u201d\n\nNadege Green is a reporter for WLRN in Miami.
