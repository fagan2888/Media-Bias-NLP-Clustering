Instead of playing all those patsy defenses from last year\u2019s NFC East, the Broncos are taking on all those defensive powerhouses in the NFC West.\n\nThe Broncos didn\u2019t go into their bye week this season putting up 45 points against hapless Washington, as they did last year. They put up 20 points against Seattle \u2014 which wasn\u2019t bad, considering the Seahawks allowed a league-low 14.4 points last season.\n\nFor their fourth game of the 2014 season, the Broncos won\u2019t be putting up 52 points against a rebuilding Philadelphia team, as they did in Game 4 a year ago. They\u2019ll be playing Sunday at Sports Authority Field at Mile High against the Arizona Cardinals, who four weeks into this season have the league\u2019s second-stingiest defense with a mere 15.0 points allowed per game.\n\nNot that it\u2019s all about the opponent. The Broncos\u2019 offensive line hasn\u2019t graded out well in run blocking. And Thomas has started sluggishly after he ranked among the league\u2019s top three in combined receiving yards the previous two seasons.\n\nBroncos receivers coach Tyke Tolbert mentions two reasons he believes Thomas\u2019 slump will end soon. One is the return of slot receiver Wes Welker, who missed the first two games because of a suspension.\n\n\u201cOne thing that might have put him a little off his game is when Wes missed those games, we moved Demaryius around a little bit and that might have messed with him psychologically,\u201d Tolbert said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t able to concentrate solely on the position he\u2019s used to playing. But he\u2019s working at it. On the players\u2019 off day Monday, he came in and caught 200 balls off the Jugs machine. Everybody knows he\u2019s our best player. I have all the confidence in the world he\u2019s going to start playing like our best player.\u201d\n\nAnother reason for Thomas\u2019 slump is his speciality \u2014 yards after catch \u2014 may have worked against him. Thomas\u2019 1,242 yards after catch the previous two years were tops among NFL receivers.\n\nIn his rush this year for the large gain after the catch, though, Thomas forgot about Part 1 \u2014 the catch. He\u2019s averaging just 4.3 receptions and 47.0 yards through three games.\n\n\u201cWe always talk about how you catch balls with your eyes, as well as your hands,\u201d Tolbert said. \u201cHe has a tendency to trust his hands so much, he likes to look and see where he\u2019s going to run with the ball before he looks it in. That\u2019s a point of emphasis with us \u2014 look it in and catch it first, tuck second, run third. It\u2019s been a major emphasis, really, from the beginning, but even more so now in this bye week.\u201d\n\nIt won\u2019t be easy for Thomas to regain form this week, though, as he figures to take on one of the league\u2019s best cornerbacks in Arizona\u2019s Patrick Peterson. It\u2019s another aspect to the Broncos\u2019 step up in defensive competition this year.\n\nAs the Broncos were scoring a record 606 points last season, they piled up 189 points, or 31.2 percent of their total, in their four games against NFC East opponents.\n\nThe breakdown: 41 points at the New York Giants, 52 against Philadelphia, 51 at Dallas and 45 vs. Washington.\n\nThe 20 points the Broncos scored last week at Seattle put them three touchdowns off their 2013 pace. And the Cardinals\u2019 defense is so good, it has gone 2-0 with backup quarterback Drew Stanton, defeating the Giants in New York and San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIn the simplest of terms, it\u2019s not always about the points an offense can put up but how many the opposing defense will allow.\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos\u2019 offense not struggling as much as facing good competition", "title": "Broncos\u2019 offense not struggling as much as facing good competition", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/28/broncos-offense-not-struggling-as-much-as-facing-good-competition/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140928__demaryius-thomasp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140928__demaryius-thomasp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-28T21:34:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:14:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Broncos didn\u2019t go into their bye week this season putting up 45 points against hapless Washington, as they did last year.\nThe 20 points the Broncos scored last week at Seattle put them three touchdowns off their 2013 pace.\n\u201cGive the opponent some credit,\u201d Broncos coach John Fox said last week, and just about every week before that.\nThey put up 20 points against Seattle \u2014 which wasn\u2019t bad, considering the Seahawks allowed a league-low 14.4 points last season.\nIn his rush this year for the large gain after the catch, though, Thomas forgot about Part 1 \u2014 the catch."}
