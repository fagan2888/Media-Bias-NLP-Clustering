The mayor said he planned to create at least 16 new community health clinics in the communities of highest need and increase the efficiency and capacity of existing clinics. De Blasio's vision, according to his campaign website, was to have these health centers serve an additional 500,000 patients by the end of his first term.\n\nThat's an exceedingly ambitious number. Even if every grant application were approved for the full amount, the mayor's office estimates that this would only add space for 75,000 patients.\n\nAnd it is unlikely New York City will receive all that it asks.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services expects to award $100 million in New Access Point (NAP) funding during fiscal year 2015. The maximum grant is $650,000.\n\nThat's a relatively small amount of money and the grants are extremely competitive. De Blasio is sure to be one of many politicians vying for his constituents.\n\nLast year, the New York State received five NAP grants worth $2.8 million, which was expected to increase services for 29,000 patients. Only two of those grants went to New York City and both were in the Bronx.\n\nOne challenge unique to the city, and true for most grants for which it applies, is $650,000 doesn't go nearly as far in New York as it does in other parts of the country.\n\nSetting up a new FQHC require outside investments of capital and substantial resources.\n\nMost FQHC's would do well to think of this grant money as \u201cicing on the cake,\u201d said Larry McReynolds, president of Lutheran Family Health Services, which applied for the grant.\n\n\u201cThese are competing grants and competing grants are scored on need in the area and access,\u201d he said. \u201cMayors all across the country are supporting their neighborhoods and it gets down to a competitive formula \u2026 to try to take out personal interventions.\u201d\n\nDeputy mayor for social services Lilliam Barrios-Paoli provided Capital with the following statement: \"Healthcare has to be local. This is a model of care we have to expand across the city if we\u2019re going to reach underserved communities. We certainly hope the federal government sees the potential of these centers\u2019 proposals.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2014/10/8553961/de-blasio-pushes-federal-health-center-grants", "image": "http://www.capitalnewyork.com/sites/default/files/a%20-%20BillDeBlasio_90.png", "type": "article", "title": "De Blasio pushes for federal health center grants"}, "robots": "all", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Seeks money for 21 Federally Qualified Health Centers"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde02b\"", "article_summary": "De Blasio's vision, according to his campaign website, was to have these health centers serve an additional 500,000 patients by the end of his first term.\nThe move follows up on a promise the mayor made during his campaign to expand community health centers.\nMayor Bill de Blasio is asking the federal government to approve grant applications from 21 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC), which would expand health services for poor New Yorkers, a key component of the mayor's health agenda and a theme he ran on during his campaign.\nFQHCs are health centers that have traditionally served the poor and uninsured, offering primary and preventive care to patients, regardless of ability to pay.\nOnly two of those grants went to New York City and both were in the Bronx."}
