Big corporations like Walmart, Nike and Frito-Lay have recognized that the temp system saves them money on things like health care, workers\u2019 compensation claims and unemployment taxes, and they\u2019ve started using temp agencies to fill traditional factory jobs. These blue-collar temp workers are mostly immigrants and minorities driven into the temp system due to a lack of options in an economy that increasingly favors corporations over workers. They rise early each morning to sit in a temp agency waiting room and hope that their name is called. The United States now has more temporary workers than ever before. And, while temporary work often increases during recessions, it usually goes down as the economy improves. But this time, economists predict that temp work will remain high.\n\nIn this report, producer Karla Murthy visits a temp agency in Chicago, where she speaks to both workers who have suffered abuses on the job and members of the Chicago Workers Collaborative, an organization that advocates for workers\u2019 rights. She also speaks with Michael Grabell, a ProPublica reporter whose reporting for the recent series, \u201cTemp Land: Working in the New Economy\u201d is featured in this piece.\n\nCamera/Editor/Producer: Karla Murthy.
