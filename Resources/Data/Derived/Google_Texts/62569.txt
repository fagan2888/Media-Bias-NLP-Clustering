Russia is not “going after” gay people, President Vladimir Putin said on Friday, responding to criticism of his government’s crackdown on the movement and free speech of LGBTQ people and their allies.

“There is no ban on non-traditional forms of sexual interaction between people,” he continued, according to a report from Reuters. “We have a ban on propaganda of homosexuality. We ban nothing, we aren’t going after anyone, we have no responsibility for such contacts.”

“But please leave the children in peace,” he added.

Several activists have been arrested under the new law for openly discussing gay rights and LGBTQ individuals have been the target of escalating violence, but Putin insisted that LGBTQ Russians and others visiting during the 2014 Winter Games can “feel free and at ease.”

Unsurprisingly, LGBTQ families in Russia do not agree with Putin’s assessment of the law making it a crime to discuss LGBTQ equality — or be LGBTQ — in public.
