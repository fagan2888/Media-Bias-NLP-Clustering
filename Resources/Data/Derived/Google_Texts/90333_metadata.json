It was the first malpractice verdict against MDVIP, and is believed to be the first against any concierge management firm. The companies offer such perks as same-day appointments and more personalized care with contracted doctors in return for a retainer.\n\nThe jury found MDVIP was liable for the negligence of one of its physicians, who was sued for misdiagnosing the cause of a patient\u2019s leg pain, leading to its amputation. The jury also found the firm had falsely advertised its exceptional doctors and patient care.\n\nIndustry experts say the ruling is significant because it shows concierge companies can be held liable for the care provided by their contracted doctors. The companies typically argue they do not actually provide care but merely act as brokers between doctors and patients.\n\n\u201cThis pierces that veil\u2026and shows these companies have a legal risk that everyone assumed did not exist,\u201d said Tom Blue, chief strategy officer of the American Academy of Private Physicians, a trade group of concierge doctors.\n\nMDVIP argued it was not responsible for the actions of a physician with whom it had contracted. MDVIP physicians are not directly employed by the company; the physicians pay the firm a per-patient fee for services such as marketing, branding, and other support.\n\nThe doctor, Charles Metzger Jr., settled with the plaintiff\u2019s family before the trial.\n\nMDVIP representatives declined to be interviewed, but they indicated they would appeal the verdict. In a statement, the company said it and Metzger acted appropriately.\n\nKaren Terry, one of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, said the verdict will push MDVIP and similar companies to scrutinize doctors more carefully before they affiliate with them because they may be liable for the doctors\u2019 actions.\n\nSuch companies will also be more cautious about advertising that they offer better care. \u201cYou can\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t keep,\u201d Terry said. \u201cThis verdict is going to have a huge impact on MDVIP.\u201d\n\nHarry Nelson, a Los Angeles health care attorney, agreed the verdict will change how companies market their doctors. \u201cA lot of people will be taking notice of this verdict\u2026It\u2019s a shocking decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe result of this decision is going to be more caution from the concierge medicine companies in terms of their claims of providing superior care.\u201d\n\nBut Roberta Greenspan, founder of Specialdocs Consultants, a concierge medicine consulting firm in Chicago, was skeptical of the decision\u2019s significance.\n\n\u201cThis singular verdict will not have a major long-term effect on the industry,\u201d she said. \u201cThe industry has evolved from a fad years ago to one that has gained tremendous respect.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 6,000 doctors nationally have moved to concierge-style practices in the past 15 years, with the figure doubling just in the past five, according to the concierge trade group. Patients who see concierge doctors typically pay an annual fee, in addition to their insurance coverage, in return for gaining easier access to doctors and more personalized care.\n\nThe lawsuit against MDVIP was brought by the widower of the late Joan Beber of Boca Raton, who had sought medical attention for leg pain. Despite what plaintiff\u2019s lawyers described as the progressive worsening of her condition, she was repeatedly misdiagnosed by Metzger and other MDVIP-affiliated staff. She was referred to orthopedists who they contended did not get her medical records or learn of her worsening symptoms. The information, they argued, might have led to the discovery of a serious circulation problem that eventually required above-the-knee amputation of her leg.\n\nBeber died of leukemia four years after her leg was amputated in 2008.\n\nDr. Matthew Priddy, president of the concierge trade group, said the verdict will \u201cgive national companies pause if they are on the hook\u201d for their physicians\u2019 care.\n\nStill, Priddy said the industry\u2019s track record is good. While concierge physicians are not immune from malpractice suits, they are less likely to face them because they spend more time with patients than most doctors, he said. They typically limit their patients to a few hundred a year \u2013 600 is the limit for MDVIP doctors \u2014 compared to a few thousand for an average practice. They are able to do that because the retainer fees make up for lost revenue.\n\nBy Phil Galewitz, Kaiser Health News\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit national health policy news service.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Physicians News", "description": "MDVIP, the nation\u2019s largest concierge medicine\u00a0 practice, has seen meteoric growth since it was founded fifteen years ago promising \u201cexceptional care\u201d and quick access to doctors in exchange for a $1,500 annual membership fee.
