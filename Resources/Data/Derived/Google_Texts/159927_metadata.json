Two cops posed with the suspect\u2014hunting rifles in hand\u2014and let someone photograph it.\n\nThe shockingly offensive* photo\u2014which depicts the black man as an animal to be hunted\u2014was recently released to The Chicago Sun-Times after a judge ruled that it should not be kept out of the press. It was probably taken between 1999 and 2003.\n\nNeither of the two officers pictured in the photo have fared well since then. Jerome Finnigan, the man on the left, is currently serving 12 years in prison for \u201cleading a crew of rogue cops in robberies, home invasions and other crimes,\u201d according to The Sun-Times. Timothy McDermott, the man on the right, was fired last year after federal prosecutors discovered the photo and handed it over to department officials. McDermott has appealed his termination.\n\nThe photograph becoming public record probably won\u2019t help his case. (No word yet on whether the police union will agree to handle his legal expenses.) In the meantime, his lawyer, Daniel Herbert, offered this defense:\n\nIn his closing arguments at the police board hearing, Herbert emphasized the lack of information about where and when the photo was taken \u2014 and the mystery surrounding the African-American man\u2019s identity. \u201cWhat\u2019s to say this individual wasn\u2019t performing at a Christmas pageant in the district and was dressed as a reindeer and had taken the reindeer suit off? Again, I don\u2019t mean to make preposterous arguments, but the charges in this case, they warrant that,\u201d he said.\n\nThe black man is believed to have been a drug suspect who was released without charges. His name is unknown.\n\n*Update: I initially wrote that the photo was \"shockingly racist.\" That may have been going too far, since we don't know very much about the context or officers' motivations. To be clear, there is no context that would make the photo okay, but \"offensive\" is probably a fairer description than \"racist.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Woah", "title": "Offensive Police Photo: Why Is a Black Suspect Wearing Antlers?
