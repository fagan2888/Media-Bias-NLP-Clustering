They included members of the Archdiocesan Pastoral and Finance Council, the Council of Priests and parishioners of differing points of view,\n\n\"He listened to everyone's concern ... there is tremendous love and respect for Archbishop Gregory, and support for his decision to move forward,\" Chivers said.\n\nGregory moved into the 6,000-square-foot home in Atlanta's upscale Buckhead neighborhood in January. It was built on land donated by Joseph Mitchell, nephew of \"Gone With the Wind\" novelist Margaret Mitchell.\n\nThe property will be sold and the proceeds invested in the needs of the Catholic community, according to the statement. The archbishop will move into another available Archdiocesan property.\n\nEarlier this week, Gregory publicly apologized for building the mansion.\n\n\"What we didn't stop to consider, and that oversight rests with me and me alone, was that the world and the Church have changed,\" Gregory wrote Monday in the archdiocesan newspaper.\n\nThe archbishop's apology came just days after the Pope accepted the resignation of Bishop Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst, also known as the \"Bling Bishop,\" who spent $42 million renovating his residence in Limburg, Germany.\n\nSince his election last year, Francis has repeatedly urged Catholics to focus on income inequality and the suffering of society's marginalized. \"Oh, how I would like a poor Church, and for the poor,\" he has said.\n\nThe Pope himself has eschewed many of the trappings of papal life, living in a small apartment in the Vatican guesthouse instead of the sumptuous apartment in the Apostolic Palace, and traveling in a small car instead of a limousine.\n\nFrancis' example has put pressure on American bishops to adopt similarly austere lifestyles, and it has emboldened rank-and-file Catholics to call them out if they fall short.\n\nIn the past year, Archbishop Jon Myers of Newark, New Jersey, has been criticized for planning $500,000 to outfit his retirement home with a elevator, exercise pool, hot tub and library.\n\nBishop Dennis Sullivan of Camden, New Jersey, was slammed for spending the same amount on a mansion in the suburb of Woodbury while presiding over one of the state's poorest cities.\n\nCatholics in Charleston, West Virginia, have written to the Pope's ambassador, asking him to probe construction costs, including $7.5 million spent on the chancery, the diocese's central offices, according to the Charleston Gazette.\n\nIn Atlanta, Gregory said he had received \"many ... heartfelt, genuine and candidly rebuking\" e-mails, phone calls and letters during the past week.\n\n\"I failed to consider the impact on the families throughout the Archdiocese who, though struggling to pay their mortgages, utilities, tuition and other bills, faithfully respond year after year to my pleas to assist with funding our ministries and services,\" the archbishop said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Chandrika Narayan, CNN, and Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor (CNN) -- After coming under sharp criticism and issuing an apology earlier this week, the Archbishop of Atlanta announced Saturday that he would vacate his $2.2 million mansion in early May.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Archbishop to vacate $2.2 million mansion", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/04/05/archbishop-of-atlanta-to-vacate-2-2-million-mansion-in-early-may/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140402094635-01-archbishop-mansion-horizontal-gallery.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By Chandrika Narayan, CNN, and Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor\r\n\r\n(CNN) -- After coming under sharp criticism and issuing an apology earlier this week, the Archbishop of Atlanta announced Saturday that he would vacate his $2.2 million mansion in early May.", "title": "Archbishop to vacate $2.2 million mansion"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "catholic church, pope francis, archbishop wilton gregory, catholic church, pope francis", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/04/05/archbishop-of-atlanta-to-vacate-2-2-million-mansion-in-early-may/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "article_summary": "By Chandrika Narayan, CNN, and Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor(CNN) - After coming under sharp criticism and issuing an apology earlier this week, the Archbishop of Atlanta announced Saturday that he would vacate his $2.2 million mansion in early May.\nEarlier this week, Gregory publicly apologized for building the mansion.\nIn Atlanta, Gregory said he had received \"many ... heartfelt, genuine and candidly rebuking\" e-mails, phone calls and letters during the past week.\nCatholics in Charleston, West Virginia, have written to the Pope's ambassador, asking him to probe construction costs, including $7.5 million spent on the chancery, the diocese's central offices, according to the Charleston Gazette.\nThe decision came after a meeting with members of several church councils and parishioners in Archbishop Wilton Gregory's headquarters north of Atlanta."}
