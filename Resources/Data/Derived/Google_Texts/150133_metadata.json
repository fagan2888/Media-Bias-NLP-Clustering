For now, Paul Ryan ranks at the top of my list.\n\nYour answer will depend, naturally, on how you view conservatism. But when we look at Ryan\u2019s omnibus spending bill, we see a nearly across-the-board sell out on issues that most conservatives view as fundamental.\n\nRick Manning, President of Americans for Limited Government, provides a run-down on the Omnibus\u2019 main flaws:\n\nStrong on national defense? Not according to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who the Washington Examiner reports, \u201cclaimed that it will help terrorist travel and economic espionage in the United States.\u201d This is not to mention the funding of President Obama\u2019s Middle Eastern refugee resettlement program to the tune of over a billion dollars. Protecting the borders? No, the Obama executive amnesty is funded and our nation is facing another wave of illegal immigrants emboldened and encouraged by a sure knowledge that they will be welcomed into the U.S. social welfare safety net. Cutting the budget and fiscal responsibility? The omnibus appropriates a massive federal government spending splurge amounting to an additional $112 billion over the next two years, effectively destroying the Republican House\u2019s only real accomplishment over the past five years \u2014 capping federal spending.\n\nBut that\u2019s just the beginning:\n\nRein in Obama\u2019s extreme social agenda? The GOP not only failed to defund Planned Parenthood, it failed to make even minor cuts to the taxpayer dollars the group receives. Additionally, Office of Civil Rights Commissioner Gail Heriot said she was \u201cbaffled\u201d by Congress\u2019 decision to include a 7 percent raise for the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights in light of their \u201cpattern of disregard for the rule of law.\u201d The Education Department\u2019s Civil Rights Office has been in the news most recently when they forced an Illinois school district to allow a male student who claimed to be transgender to use the girls shower facilities, and Republicans rather than demanding a stop of this perverse extremism, instead gave them a raise in their budget. Stop Obama\u2019s devastating anti-energy environmental policies? In spite of the rhetoric, GOP Senators and House members failed to use the power of the purse to rein in a single one of Obama\u2019s economy crippling regulations. What is worse. . .they showed their threats against Obama\u2019s Paris climate treaty are flaccid as they did not prohibit funding of the critical Global Climate Initiative that gives U.S. dollars to third world countries as a payoff so they support the deal. The funding guarantees the Obama will not submit the treaty to the Senate and will use the EPA as the hatchet man to implement it without Congress.\n\nIn defense of the Omnibus, Ryan told Chuck Todd:\n\nThe question is, are you focusing on your goals? Are you keeping your principles intact? Are you advancing ideas that make a difference in people\u2019s lives?\n\nIf, given the criticisms cited above, the Omnibus keeps Ryan\u2019s principles intact, then his principles are not traditional conservative ones.\n\nRyan also said, in effect, wait till next year. But next year Ryan is expected to push through legislation that will lead to thousands of drug dealers being released from prison.\n\nRyan told Todd that he\u2019s all about improving the daily lives of Americans. Releasing thousands of felons convicted of drug dealing, a crime for which the recidivism rate is well in excess of 50 percent, is a very odd way to improve daily life in America.\n\nUnlike some disillusioned conservatives, I never expected the Republican controlled Congress to rid the nation of Obamacare or, indeed, to accomplish anything monumental. But I also didn\u2019t expect Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer to be gloating at the end of the year about how successful they were in attaining their liberal goals. Nor did I expect the Republican House to be poised to push through the core Obama agenda item of leniency for drug dealers.\n\nBecause of Paul Ryan\u2019s central role in all of this mischief, he\u2019s my nominee for the Republican who has hurt conservatism the most.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "By this time next year the answer might be easy: Donald Trump, if you count him as a Republican.
