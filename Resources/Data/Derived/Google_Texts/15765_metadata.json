The complaints are based on the fact that Asian-Americans as a group have substantially higher standardized test scores and grades than competing demographic groups, including whites.\n\nThe complaints prompted a separate coalition of 135 Asian-American civil rights groups to declare its firm support of affirmative action\n\nThe Vote for Democratic Presidential Candidates 100% Blacks 93 Asians 73% 75 71 Latinos 50 Whites 39 31% 25 \u201992 \u201996 \u201900 \u201904 \u201908 \u201912\n\nThe accompanying chart, compiled from data provided by the College Board, shows that college-bound Asian-Americans received the highest average SAT scores in 2015 of any group.\n\nThe cumulative score on all three SAT tests \u2013 critical reading, math and writing \u2013 was 1654 (out of a possible 2400) for Asian-Americans, 1576 for whites, 1277 for African-Americans, and 1343 for Mexican-Americans.\n\nA 2005 study published in the Social Science Quarterly, \u201cThe Opportunity Cost of Admission Preferences at Elite Universities,\u201d by Thomas J. Espenshade, a professor of sociology at Princeton, and Chang Y. Chung, a statistician at Princeton\u2019s Office of Population Research, found that \u201cAsian applicants are the biggest winners if race is no longer considered in admissions\u201d at \u201cthree highly selective private research universities\u201d which the authors declined to identify. The Asian share of those accepted at such institutions would grow from 23.7 percent to 31.5 percent, they wrote.\n\nAsian-American resistance to race-based affirmative action surfaced in California last year when leaders of the Democratic-controlled State Legislature considered putting a referendum before the voters to restore race-conscious admission policies at public colleges and universities. Asian-American voters flooded legislators with phone calls and emails opposing race-based preferences, prompting three Asian-American Democratic state senators to declare their opposition. Legislative leaders dropped their plans for a statewide referendum.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAffirmative action aside, support for the liberal agenda is solid among the broad population of Asian-Americans.\n\nJanelle Wong, a professor of American studies at the University of Maryland, emailed in response to my query:\n\nAsian Americans tend to support a strong social safety net and stronger role for government in everyday life.\n\nWong noted that on a key polling question that tests political ideology, \u201c58 percent of Asian Americans, versus 39 percent of the U.S. population in general, supports a \u2018bigger government with more services\u2019 over a \u2018smaller government with fewer services.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe same tilt to the left is clear on other issues, according to Wong: \u201cAsian Americans are more likely than the U.S. public in general to support Obamacare and to support environmental protection over economic growth.\u201d In the case of immigration, support among Asian-Americans for a path to citizenship for the undocumented has grown steadily, Wong writes, \u201cso, as the Republicans\u2019 rhetoric on immigration has become more punitive, the community has actually moved in the opposite direction.\u201d\n\nThe political liberalism of Americans of Asian descent is notable given their affluence, success in the marketplace and the high status of jobs they hold.\n\nAsian-Americans, according to the Pew Research Center, \u201care the best-educated, highest-income, fastest-growing race group in the country.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, median household income for Asian-Americans was $74,297; for whites, $60,256; for Hispanics, $42,491; and for African-Americans, $35,398.\n\nCombined SAT Scores For reading, math and writing. Asian, Asian-American, or Pacific Islander 1654 White 1576 Mexican or Mexican-American 1343 Black 1277\n\nThree out of five in the Asian-American work force have a college degree, compared with 37 percent of whites, 27 percent of African-Americans and 18 percent of Hispanics. Fifty percent of Asian-Americans have managerial or professional jobs, compared with 39 percent of whites, 29 percent of African-Americans and 20 percent of Hispanics.\n\nAsian-Americans also stand apart from other Americans of all races and ethnicities in family structure. The percent of out-of-wedlock births among Asian-Americas in 2013 was 17 percent, just over half the 29.3 percent rate for whites and far below the 53.2 rate for Hispanics and the 71.5 percent rate for African-Americans.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe work ethic is robust among Asian-Americans, who believe by 42 points (69-27) that \u201cmost people can get ahead if they\u2019re willing to work hard.\u201d Among all American adults, it\u2019s a much smaller 18 points (58-40).\n\nOn the divisive issue of abortion, Asian-Americans are more liberal than the general electorate. By 17 points (54-37), Asian-Americans believe abortions should be legal in most or all cases, compared with an eight point spread (51-43) in the general public, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nWhat can we make of all this data? There are a few preliminary inferences.\n\nThe first is that despite their affluence, Asian-Americans are on course to become a mainstay of what Stan Greenberg, the Democratic pollster, calls the \u201crising American electorate\u201d: the liberal alliance of black and Hispanic minorities, single women and young voters.\n\nIn this respect, Asian-Americans are similar to another minority voting group with strong Democratic ties, American Jews. They, too, have incomes and educations well above average. The Pew Research Center found that 42 percent of Jewish households had an income of $100,000 or more, compared with 18 percent of all American households. Along similar lines, 58 percent of Jews have college degrees, compared with 29 percent of the entire population.\n\nJewish support for Democrats is similar to that of Asian-Americans. According to Pew, 70 percent of Jews identify themselves as Democrats or lean toward the Democratic Party, and 22 percent are Republican or lean Republican. Asian-Americans share with blacks, Hispanics and Jews an experience of previously marginalized status and social exclusion. These four constituencies also share a belief that a commitment to hard work and self-reliance does not conflict with a belief in a strong government and a reliable safety net.\n\nSuch views stand in direct contrast to those of the Tea Party and Wall Street wings of the Republican Party, both of which see self-reliance and big government as antithetical to each other.\n\nIt may prove that the values that Asian-Americans, Jews, blacks and Hispanics share will create sufficient cohesion to sustain a liberal coalition, even as some members of the coalition fail to ascend the socioeconomic ladder in lockstep with the others. That is the current conundrum of the upstairs-downstairs American left.\n\nTheir Republican adversaries, who have themselves fielded a multiracial and multiethnic set of presidential candidates, are determined to fight fire with fire, as they claim to be the party most committed to upward mobility. When voters go to the polls a year from now, these Republican claims will be tested as never before.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20151104032101, "twitter": {"description": "From Bill Clinton to Barack Obama, Asian-American support for Democratic presidential candidates more than doubled.
