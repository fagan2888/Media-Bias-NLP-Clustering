Mark Udall\u2019s broken promise that \u201cif you like your health plan, you can keep it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time we have a new generation of leadership in the Senate that is focused on reforming our healthcare system for the next generation,\u201d Gardner said in a release from his campaign.\n\n\u201cWhen our family\u2019s healthcare plan was cancelled because of Obamacare last year, we felt firsthand the painful effects of Senator Udall\u2019s support for Obamacare. Countless families have seen their premiums rise, lost access to their doctors, or lost their health insurances plans altogether \u2014 they have Senator Udall to thank.\u201d\n\nHolding what\u2019s apparently the cancellation letter his family received, Gardner notes in the ad that \u201c335,000 Coloradans had their plans cancelled too.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have continually responded to Republicans\u2019 use of that figure by noting that 92 percent of those who got cancellation letters were also offered renewal options that either complied with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage mandates or the option of keeping their existing non-ACA compliant plans.\n\nUdall\u2019s campaign responded Monday by blasting Gardner for voting dozens of times to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cCongressman Gardner has voted 51 times to go back to a time when insurance companies could jack up your rates, cut your coverage, pocket your cash and then drop you if you got sick. Just like women\u2019s health and immigration, Gardner\u2019s views on health care are backwards and wrong,\u201d said Udall for Colorado spokesperson Kristin Lynch.\n\n\u201cColoradans want a senator like Mark Udall who is fighting to make the new health care law work for Colorado, not a partisan grandstander like Rep. Gardner who would let insurers discriminate against Coloradans with preexisting conditions.\u201d\n\nColorado\u2019s uninsured rate has dropped six points from 17 percent in 2013 to 11 percent this July, the fifth biggest drop of any state.\n\nLast week, another ad from Crossroads GPS featured a Castle Rock woman attacking Udall for supporting Obamacare, which the ad claims forced her to go back to work.\n\nThe woman, Richelle McKim, told FOX31 Denver that she actually went back to work for reasons other than Obamacare, although she personally disagrees with the law\u2019s individual mandate that all Americans be insured.", "article_metadata": {"description": "DENVER -- When Republican Congressman Cory Gardner launched his U.S. Senate campaign in late February, he talked almost exclusively about his Democratic opponent's support for Obamacare.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=334627011", "og": {"site_name": "FOX31 Denver", "description": "DENVER \u2014 When Republican Congressman Cory Gardner launched his U.S. Senate campaign in late February, he talked almost exclusively about his Democratic opponent\u2019s support for Obamacare.\u2026", "title": "Gardner hits Udall on Obamacare in latest TV ad", "url": "http://kdvr.com/2014/08/11/gardner-hits-udall-on-obamacare-in-latest-tv-ad/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/gardnerobamacaread.jpg", "height": 433}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/gardnerobamacaread.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@kdvr", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kdvr"}, "keywords": "politics,", "msapplication-tooltip": "Denver, Colorado News, Weather, Sports and more", "p": {"domain_verify": "5873d9988d745234e5abf9cff7ed939d"}, "fb": {"pages": 90018331599}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "application-name": "FOX31 Denver", "google-site-verification": "AmrqnQj74ngNWI1vn6WwMZyy9IWy4ZqooGuxLtd7lIs", "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox31denver", "published_time": "2014-08-11T18:27:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-12T14:40:55+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox31denver"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://kdvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/17e52d5bd05a36821dc7d1d5f90e105c?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc29f\"", "article_summary": "\u00d7 Gardner hits Udall on Obamacare in latest TV adDENVER \u2014 When Republican Congressman Cory Gardner launched his U.S. Senate campaign in late February, he talked almost exclusively about his Democratic opponent\u2019s support for Obamacare.\nLast week, another ad from Crossroads GPS featured a Castle Rock woman attacking Udall for supporting Obamacare, which the ad claims forced her to go back to work.\nJust like women\u2019s health and immigration, Gardner\u2019s views on health care are backwards and wrong,\u201d said Udall for Colorado spokesperson Kristin Lynch.\n\u201cWhen our family\u2019s healthcare plan was cancelled because of Obamacare last year, we felt firsthand the painful effects of Senator Udall\u2019s support for Obamacare.\nUdall\u2019s campaign responded Monday by blasting Gardner for voting dozens of times to repeal the Affordable Care Act."}
