We see this as validation for all students in business school.\u201d\n\nNitu and Finney were part of a group working on a business plan for an entrepreneurial class at CU\u2019s Leeds School of Business a few years ago when a classmate showed up bummed that thieves had stolen his skis at a ski area. Another classmate lamented the theft of two bikes in Boulder.\n\nThe thievery sparked the pair on an idea for an outdoor locker system. They crafted a high-tech kiosk that networked with an Uber-style app for mobile phones.\n\nWith a $375,000 investment from family and business-contest prizes, the entrepreneurs debuted 71 lockers at Winter Park ski area in February 2013 and were ramping up installations in more resorts this winter. The pair\u2019s business plan did not cost resorts, which provided only space and a wireless Internet connection. SnowGate handled the rest, sharing revenue with the resorts and offering 24-hour customer service. The kiosks are built by Louisville\u2019s Kiosk Information Systems \u2014 the same outfit that manufactures Denver\u2019s B-cycle stations.\n\nThe first full season at Winter Park returned a profit to SnowGate and to the resort, Finney said.\n\nFinney and Nitu won a regional Miller Lite Tap the Future business contest last spring that carried a $20,000 prize. But they didn\u2019t win the contest\u2019s $200,000 grand prize in August, so they were scrambling to fund expansion of SnowGate.\n\n\u201cWe were strapped for cash,\u201d Finney said.\n\nEnter Best Lockers, which is owned by Safemark Systems, a Florida company that installs electronic safes in hotels rooms across the U.S. The new owner is keeping the SnowGate name as it expands from interior lockers at ski resorts to outdoor storage for skis and snowboards.\n\n\u201cWe were looking to maybe design our own outdoor unit, and this opportunity presented itself,\u201d Best Lockers president Daryle Bobb said. \u201cSo instead of reinventing the wheel, we ended up doing a deal with those guys.\u201d\n\nBest Lockers is a national leader in storage and lockers at water parks and is growing its ski resort presence, said Bobb, noting the company\u2019s indoor lockers at Vail, Breckenridge, Winter Park and many more resorts in the northeast.\n\n\u201cSnowGate really complements our interior storage at ski resorts,\u201d he said. \u201cThey did a nice job, and it was nice for them to be able to cash out. Hopefully we can take it to the next level.\u201d\n\nJason Blevins: 303-954-1374 or jblevins@denverpost.com", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CU entrepreneurs sell SnowGate ski locker system to national firm", "title": "CU entrepreneurs sell SnowGate ski locker system to national firm", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/26/cu-entrepreneurs-sell-snowgate-ski-locker-system-to-national-firm/", "image": {"width": 435, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141226__20141227_A19_BZ27SNOWGATEp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141226__20141227_A19_BZ27SNOWGATEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-26T12:16:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T05:14:44+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The two former University of Colorado students who created SnowGate, an outdoor ski locker system, have sold to a national locker firm.\nThey aren\u2019t talking about the details of the deal, but Nitu called it \u201ca moral victory.\u201d\u201cWe built an awesome product that continues to get used every day at Winter Park,\u201d Nitu said.\n\u201cSnowGate really complements our interior storage at ski resorts,\u201d he said.\nThe new owner is keeping the SnowGate name as it expands from interior lockers at ski resorts to outdoor storage for skis and snowboards.\nThe first full season at Winter Park returned a profit to SnowGate and to the resort, Finney said."}
