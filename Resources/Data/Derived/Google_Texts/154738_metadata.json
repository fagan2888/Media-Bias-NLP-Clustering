Alan Grayson (D-FL) hailed the rise of what he called \u201cstealth socialism\u201d through America\u2019s recent monetary policy decisions.\n\nAsked by interviewer David Dayen whether the financial system has become \u201csafer\u201d in the years since the financial collapse and subsequent government interventions like 2010\u2019s Dodd-Frank bill, Grayson praised the Federal Reserve for its \u201cunconventional\u201d policies that have \u201cput us back on a low-level track toward growth.\u201d\n\nAsked about the Fed\u2019s expanding balance sheet, the Florida Democrat said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a government takeover of the bond market. Stealth socialism\u2019s been created. Government simply ends up owning more and more and more.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf government had taken over the steel industry, maybe it would have been more noticeable,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken over the financing of housing industry as well, with a desired result.\u201d\n\nGrayson, a Harvard-educated lawyer and economist, offered praise for these sorts of policies: \u201cThe result is now, finally, particularly in areas that were hard-hit, like mine in Central Florida, housing is ticking up again. So the Fed did in essence create an economic baseline that has led to something along the lines of 50,000-100,000 jobs created a month, setting a foundation for recovery for the U.S. economy.\u201d\n\nRead the full interview over at Salon.\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Andrew Kirell (@AndrewKirell) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a recent interview with Salon, outspoken progressive Rep.
