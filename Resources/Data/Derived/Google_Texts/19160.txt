The following was released by Washington State Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler:

I paid my first health insurance premium, but I don’t have an ID card. What do I do?

Consumers were able to start using their insurance under the Affordable Care Act beginning Wednesday. Washington consumers can sign up using Washington Healthplanfinder.



While the Insurance Commissioner doesn’t administer the Washington Healthplanfinder, our consumer advocates are hearing from a lot of people who have completed their application and paid their first month’s insurance premium, but haven’t yet received their new insurance card or plan information. People want to know what will happen if they need to use their insurance before they get their insurance card.



Medical providers need your insurance ID number to bill them for your care; they don’t need the actual card. If you paid but do not yet have an ID number, you should contact your insurance plan and ask for that information. Your plan can also tell you when your card will likely arrive. If you feel more comfortable having a card, you can ask your company to tell you how to print a temporary ID card.



If you are not sure how to contact your plan, our website has contact information for each of the insurance companies that sells plans through Washington Healthplanfinder.



If you pay out-of-pocket for medical care because you don’t have ID number, you can submit a reimbursement request to your insurance company.
