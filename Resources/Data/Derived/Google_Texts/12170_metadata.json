Similar events were held at campuses, city halls and public spaces in Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston and Portland.\n\nHere at Schenley Plaza, Johnson was one of more than a dozen speakers and performers at the rally.\n\nThe crowd was a mix of races and ages who held many of the same printed posters: \u201cSTOP Racist Police Treatment,\u201d \u201cFists Up, Fight Back,\u201d and \u201cIt Is Right to Rebel.\u201d At the corner of Schenley Drive, four motorcycle cops stood on guard, within earshot of the chants and calls for justice for Freddie Gray and others.\n\nOutside the tent, students sat on the grass in the warm spring air, and some walking by stopped to listen. Early on, 10-year-old Trevon Bibbs, stage name Young Schola, energized the crowd with a rap, beginning with the sentiment that he no longer wanted to live in a war zone.\n\n\u201cNo justice, no peace, let's end the violence in the streets,\u201d he said, and the crowd joined in.\n\nHis mother Heather Garczyniski brought Trevon from Erie, in part on advice from a music mentor who encourages the boy to spread his message. \u201cWe came here in solidarity,\u201d she said. Garcyniski said one night earlier this year, her son woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of gunshots.\n\n\u201cI worry about the world he's growing up in,\u201d she said.\n\nDavid Hopkins came to the rally from Robinson, along with his daughter who attended with friends. A Baltimore native, he said he was proud of her when she asked to attend.\n\n\u201cIt was a good opportunity to be a part of some demonstration locally since we couldn't be with our family and friends in Baltimore,\u201d said Hopkins, wearing an Orioles cap and Baltimore T-shirt. \u201cIt's an opportunity to contribute.\u201d\n\nThe rallies, he said, were \u201chope in the wake of hopelessness,\u201d noting the involvement of younger generations.\n\n\u201cYou see a lot of the violent demonstrations and the riots and outcries of hopelessness,\u201d he said. \u201cThe peaceful demonstrations are outcries of hope, and I think the confluence of the two ultimately leads to some level of change.\u201d\n\nMelissa Daniels is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
