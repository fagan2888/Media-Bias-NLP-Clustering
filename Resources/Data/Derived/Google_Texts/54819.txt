Liz Wells and Chris Jarobe recently became the proud parents of triplets. But they weren’t your average triplets. The three babies are identical.

Dr. Rob Hopkin, a geneticist from Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, told WXIX that identical triplets are “very rare,” and are at an increased risk for birth defects or even death.

“There’s a very high risk with triplets, in particular identical triplets where one or more of them will have some birth defects,” Hopkin said. “More than half of the cases they lost one of the triplets.”

The three baby boys—Carson, Ayden and Liam—have already made their first TV appearance to celebrate the clean bill of health.
