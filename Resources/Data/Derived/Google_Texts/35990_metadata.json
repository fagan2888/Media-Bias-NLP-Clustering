A Google search for \u201cKasich gay marriage\u201d yields over 10,000 largely fawning articles, such as this piece by Slate\u2019s LGBTQ editor extolling his \u201cgracious and humane view.\u201d\n\nAsked by Megyn Kelly, \u201cif you had a son or daughter who was gay or lesbian, how would you explain to them your opposition to same-\u00adsex marriage?\u201d Kasich replied:\n\nWell, look, I\u2019m an old\u00ad fashioned person here, and I happen to believe in traditional marriage. But I\u2019ve also said the court has ruled \u2026 and I said we\u2019ll accept it. And guess what, I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay. Because somebody doesn\u2019t think the way I do, doesn\u2019t mean that I can\u2019t care about them or can\u2019t love them. So if one of my daughters happened to be that, of course I would love them and I would accept them. Because you know what? That\u2019s what we\u2019re taught when we have strong faith.\n\n\n\nSo the issues like that \u2026 are planted to divide us. I think the simple fact of the matter is \u2026 we need to give everybody a chance, treat everybody with respect, and let them share in this great American dream that we have, Megan. So, look, I\u2019m going to love my daughters, I\u2019m going to love them no matter what they do. Because, you know what, God gives me unconditional love. I\u2019m going to give it to my family and my friends and the people around me.\n\nIs Kasich Catering to Social Conservatives? Despite the media adulation, Kasich\u2019s performance doesn\u2019t seem to have helped him much in the polls. Only 8 percent of GOP respondents in the first post-\u00addebate survey called him the winner; and while 54 percent said they had a more favorable opinion of him after the debate compared to only 18 percent who had a less favorable opinion, this just placed him in the middle of the pack \u2013 well behind Ben Carson\u2019s 80 percent to 9 percent ratio and Marco Rubio\u2019s 68 percent to \u00ad13 percent ratio. Yet these poll numbers among Republicans notwithstanding, some of the Kasich enthusiasm appears to have extended to conservatives as well as liberals, and not just to establishment organs like the Wall Street Journal editorial page, which termed his gay marriage answer \u201cdeft,\u201d or Peggy Noonan, who characterized it as \u201clovely.\u201d If my Facebook feed is any indication, Kasich\u2019s appeal is increasing among social conservatives.\n\nKasich\u2019s position on the tension between gay rights and religious and other first amendment freedoms is the worst of any of the seventeen GOP contenders. Yet this is not completely shocking. The part of Kasich\u2019s gay marriage response that seems to have particularly resonated with social and religious conservatives \u2013 his invocation of the unconditional love that flows from his faith \u2013 was lovely and moving. The rest of his reply, however, should trouble cultural conservatives \u2013 especially when considered in the context of other things he has said about same\u00ad-sex marriage and the rights of those with religious or other objections to it. His statements suggest that he\u2019s not just an \u201cold\u00ad fashioned person\u201d who \u201cbelieves in traditional marriage\u201d who would still love his daughters if they were gay, but rather an \u201cevolved\u201d politician who\u2019s fully prepared to acquiesce to the same\u00ad-sex agenda.\n\nThat\u2019s speculation, of course. But even so, there\u2019s been a lot of \u201cevolution\u201d on gay marriage, so what\u2019s a \u201clittle straight lie\u201d for the base when we need the votes of all those millennials riding around in their Ubers drinking their craft beer? What is not speculation, though \u2013 and what\u2019s far more important in evaluating Kasich\u2019s candidacy \u2013 is that his position on the tension between gay rights and religious and other first amendment freedoms is the worst of any of the seventeen GOP contenders.\n\nThe social conservatives who liked Kasich\u2019s answer apparently took his ritual affirmation of belief in \u201ctraditional marriage\u201d at face value, and didn\u2019t recognize his stress on accepting the Court\u2019s ruling, his enthusiastic reference to attending a gay wedding, or his tut\u00adtutting about the divisiveness of all social issues as a dog whistle to liberal opinion. But that\u2019s the thing about dog whistles; only the dogs are supposed to hear them.\n\nIt\u2019s Time for Kasich to Come out of the Closet Kasich, whose senior strategists are the same pro\u00ad-gay marriage consultants who managed the failed 2012 campaign of former Utah Governor and Obama Administration Ambassador Jon Huntsman, is indeed running as the Huntsman of 2016 \u2013 the candidate of the socially liberal, pro-\u00adbusiness country \u00adclub faction. He began beating the drum for \u201crespecting\u201d the Court\u2019s marriage ruling two months before it was handed down, reiterating this sole point in interviews after the Obergefell decision, refusing to criticize both its result and its flawed legal reasoning.\n\nIt is therefore hard to see the \u2018Court has ruled\u2019 incantation as anything other than code for \u2018I agree with the decision and view criticism of it as illegitimate.\u2019 Of course, liberals don\u2019t routinely intone their belief in campaign finance regulation but then say \u201cthe Court has ruled and we have to accept\u201d Citizens United, just as genuine right-\u00adto\u00ad-lifers didn\u2019t persistently express their opposition to abortion but then say \u201cthe Court has ruled and we have to accept\u201d Roe v. Wade. They \u201caccept\u201d these decisions as the law in the tautological way that one accepts the mere existence of something, but they still criticize and work to change it, as is their right and obligation as citizens in a democracy. It is therefore hard to see the \u201cCourt has ruled\u201d incantation as anything other than code for \u201cI agree with the decision and view criticism of it as illegitimate.\u201d\n\nThis is underscored by Kasich\u2019s exuberance about actually having attended a same\u00ad-sex wedding, something he was even more ebullient about in an earlier interview: \u201cIf my [gay] friend invites me to a wedding my big question is \u2018well, what time is it?\u2019 I mean it\u2019s a time to celebrate with people.\u201d Hammering home the point the day after the debate he told CBS, \u201cI\u2019m for traditional marriage, but \u2026 I\u2019ve got friends that don\u2019t practice that, and \u2026 God bless them.\u201d That doesn\u2019t sound like a guy whose belief in traditional marriage extends beyond just merely thinking that it should still be legal.\n\nThe biggest concern with Kasich, though, is not his fingers\u00ad-crossed\u00ad-behind\u00ad-his\u00ad-back failure to just come out and say he supports gay marriage. It\u2019s his complete dismissal of the potential threat to religious and other first amendment freedoms that all four dissenting justices warned of in Obergefell (including Chief Justice John Roberts, who had just upheld Obamacare the day before and so can hardly be written off as a right\u00adwing yahoo). He is the only GOP candidate to go out of his way to downplay this threat, saying \u201clet\u2019s not get carried away.\u201d At a news conference he gave perfunctory lip service to his \u201cdisappointment\u201d with the ruling, but when a reporter asked about its impact on \u201ca photographer refusing to work a same-\u00adsex wedding,\u201d he curtly replied \u201clet\u2019s not create problems where there frankly is (sic) none.\u201d Afterwards, he quickly turned away from her in the impatient way a politician does when someone has just said something particularly inane.\n\nWe Can\u2019t Ignore the Consequences of the Impending Culture War Alas, Governor Kasich, if only these conflicts didn\u2019t exist. But as Chief Justice Roberts and the other dissenters realized, the growing intolerance of the gay rights movement and its leftist supporters had already created big problems for freedom of speech and religious even before Obergefell.\n\nThe problems that Kasich thinks don\u2019t exist have become even more ominous since Obergefell, and are increasingly alarming for the nation\u2019s religious population. Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich \u201cgot carried away\u201d from his job last year, when it was discovered that he\u2019d made a modest $1,000 contribution to the successful 2008 ballot initiative to repeal court-\u00adordered same-\u00adsex marriage in California. Aaron and Melissa Klein, the evangelical former owners of a small bakery in Portland, \u201cgot carried away\u201d from their business and faced crippling fines after declining, on religious grounds, to make a custom cake for a lesbian commitment ceremony. Others who may be \u201cgetting carried away\u201d soon include tenured Marquette political science professor John McAdams, who is at risk of termination for criticizing a graduate teaching assistant who had browbeaten an undergraduate for opposing gay marriage, and Dr. Paul Church, a Harvard Medical School surgery professor facing revocation of his hospital privileges for untoward comments about the health risks of gay sex.\n\nThe problems that Kasich thinks don\u2019t exist have become even more ominous since Obergefell, and are increasingly alarming for the nation\u2019s religious population. A movement to tax, and thus effectively destroy, churches that will not perform gay marriages has sprung up overnight. On top of that, corporate America has already stepped in to threaten the loss of church insurance coverage.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Fri, 14 Aug 2015 06:51:04 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Governor John Kasich gained favor among Republicans after the first debate, but his record on gay marriage should give conservatives some serious pause.", "title": "John Kasich Is The Liberal Media's Darling", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/19651916471_373faab6fe_k.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-17T07:07:12+00:00", "url": "http://thefederalist.com/2015/08/14/john-kasich-is-the-liberal-medias-darling/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Federalist", "description": "Governor John Kasich gained favor among Republicans after the first debate, but his record on gay marriage should give conservatives some serious pause.", "title": "John Kasich Is The Liberal Media's Darling", "image": {"src": "http://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/19651916471_373faab6fe_k.jpg"}, "creator": "@FDRLST", "site": "@FDRLST", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"section": 2016, "tag": "Aaron and Melissa Klein,Brendan Eich,Chief Justice John Roberts,Citizens United,Dr. Paul Church,Gay Marriage,GOP debate,John Kasich,John McAdams,Jon Huntsman,Megyn Kelly,Obergefell,Obergefell v.
