KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) â€” A doctor at a hospital in southern Pakistan says 57 people are dead after a fiery crash between a passenger bus and an oil tanker.

Dr. Seemi Jamali, who heads the emergency section at Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Center in Karachi, says they had received 57 bodies.

She says the bodies were so charred that they would have to do DNA tests to identify the victims.

The Minister of Transportation for Sindh Province, Mir Mumtaz Hussain Jakhrani, says the crash happened when the passenger bus hit an oil tanker early Sunday about 50 kilometers (31 miles) outside of Karachi.

Such horrific traffic accidents are not uncommon in Pakistan due to reckless, untrained drivers and poor roads.
