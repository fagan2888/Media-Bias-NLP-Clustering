Few ideas were more fundamental to the thinking of that generation than the need to separate the important powers a national government would exercise. Liberty itself depended upon such a separation, James Madison and others passionately believed.\n\nIn the American system that has evolved, the legislative program of the national government more often than not begins with what the president wants, and proceeds in Congress with the leaders aligned with the president\u2019s political party working to enact it. Although the party leaders insist upon their independent authority, and the Constitution is supposed to guarantee that it exists, they are generally expected to act as the president\u2019s legislative agents.\n\nWhen \u2013 as is the case right now \u2013 the two houses of Congress have a majority in control whose leaders are from the other party, the president needs to count even more on his political allies on Capitol Hill; otherwise, he has to contend with two adversaries.\n\nThis relationship has to be a delicate balance, with the president respecting the need for his legislative allies to find their own ways to proceed (and sometimes the need not to proceed at all), given the political realities they face, and the allies respecting the need for the president to succeed at least with passage of the White House\u2019s major policy initiatives.\n\nBy constitutional design, the president and members of Congress must answer to different political constituencies. That, too, is different from the situation with parliamentary government, where the governing party must first prevail in a nationwide election, and then chooses a prime minister to carry out the will of the electorate. Once a week, every Wednesday when Parliament is sitting, the prime minister must go before the House of Commons to defend the government\u2019s ongoing program.\n\nBecause, in America, political accountability is very different, that can \u2013 and does \u2014 complicate presidential-congressional relationships. This means that a president cannot casually assume legislative loyalty to the White House, and cannot make every piece of legislation a make-or-break test of that loyalty, and the White House\u2019s allies in Congress cannot routinely pursue only their own agenda.\n\nThe obvious implication of this situation is that the White House must be very clear in choosing its most significant legislative priorities, and in calculating \u2013 in advance \u2013 how much it can give away in compromise if that should become necessary to achieving legislative success.\n\nPresident Obama in coming weeks is facing a stern test of this very circumstance, as Congress debates whether to approve or disapprove of the proposed multi-nation deal to restrict the ability of Iran\u2019s government to develop a nuclear arsenal. It is clear that Obama and his aides have decided that this is the most important foreign policy initiative that they will pursue in his remaining time in office. And they have made clear that they can make no concessions about potentially modifying the agreed-upon plan to make it more acceptable in Congress.\n\nThe deal is being offered on a take-it-or-leave-it basis only. And, given the fact that the Republican leaders of both houses oppose the Iran agreement, the President cannot afford significant defections from his Democratic allies.\n\nIt thus was to be expected that the White House would react very strongly when officials there learned that the Democratic senator who appears to be next in line to lead that party\u2019s bloc of senators, when a new Congress assembles after next year\u2019s elections, will oppose the Iran deal, and will work for its rejection. That senator is Charles Shumer of New York.\n\nThe public reaction so far from those who are close to President Obama was sufficiently strong as to suggest that they would like to see him punished for breaking ranks on this crucial question. If America had a parliamentary system, that kind of party discipline would have considerable chance of succeeding.\n\nBut is that something that an American president and his aides want to risk doing, and is it something they can actually bring about?\n\nIf they do intend to insert themselves directly into the Democratic caucus, to try to head off Shumer\u2019s leadership candidacy, they risk alienating other Democrats with whom Shumer already has a following. The President, as a former senator himself, almost surely would hesitate before intruding personally or through his lieutenants into caucus consideration of its next leader.\n\nThe more limiting factor, though, is that the Iran deal will either succeed or fail in Congress this year, and the leadership issue among Senate Democrats will not reach a serious point until the latter part of next year, at the earliest. At that point, the President will be in his final weeks in office, and lame-duck status tends to diminish the political strength of the White House.\n\nThe reality is that the White House\u2019s only realistic option at this point is not to directly threaten the New York senator\u2019s leadership ambitions, but simply to go on waging a public relations effort to keep others in the caucus from following him into the opposition on the Iran pact.\n\nRecent Stories on Constitution Daily\n\nWhat happens if a Vice President resigns and nobody takes his place?\n\n10 famous political debate moments\n\nJon Stewart\u2019s departure is the end of an era in American satire\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "Lyle Denniston, the National Constitution Center\u2019s constitutional literacy adviser, looks at how Senator Chuck Shumer\u2019s decision to oppose the Iran nuclear deal highlights our differences with the ...", "title": "Constitution Check: Is there a party loyalty test for leadership in Congress?", "url": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2015/08/constitution-check-is-there-a-party-loyalty-test-for-leadership-in-congress/", "image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Charles_Schumer_official_portrait.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Charles_Schumer_official_portrait.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 59543893235, "page_id": 59543893235, "app_id": 108483985888821}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-11T09:57:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-10T17:28:11+00:00", "author": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/author/lyle-denniston/"}, "msvalidate.01": "7A707BA806870C4CB077BE8CFB94D00F", "google-site-verification": "g-YRZSJfme1Aa6j71jlmtj3ZRUHZKtKda1U7n-deAIA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdcf6\"", "article_summary": "This means that a president cannot casually assume legislative loyalty to the White House, and cannot make every piece of legislation a make-or-break test of that loyalty, and the White House\u2019s allies in Congress cannot routinely pursue only their own agenda.\nBy constitutional design, the president and members of Congress must answer to different political constituencies.\nAt that point, the President will be in his final weeks in office, and lame-duck status tends to diminish the political strength of the White House.\nIf America had a parliamentary system, that kind of party discipline would have considerable chance of succeeding.\nAnd they have made clear that they can make no concessions about potentially modifying the agreed-upon plan to make it more acceptable in Congress."}
