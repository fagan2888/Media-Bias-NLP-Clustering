Computer glitches crippled the processing of hundreds of thousands of applications for policies for uninsured or underinsured Americans, much to the dismay of officials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u0092t the first time federal officials hit stumbling blocks with the launch of a program. The scenario was similar 11 years ago with the advent of the Medicare Reform Act, the largest overhaul in the 38-year-history of the public health program for senior citizens and disabled individuals. It was signed into law in December 2003 by President George W. Bush and with it came Medicare Part D prescription plans and Medicare Advantage Plans.\n\n\u0093When Medicare Advantage Plans started, it was driving us crazy,\u0094 said Sheila Church, outreach services director at the Chester-based ChesPenn Health Services, a federally funded community health center where she has worked for 23 years.\n\nAs she and others did with Medicare Reform matters, Church and her colleagues locally and nationwide were vigilant in helping consumers navigate the Health Insurance Marketplace, one of President Barack Obama\u0092s health care reform measures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir efforts proved fruitful. By last Thanksgiving, Americans were navigating the Health Insurance Marketplace with relative ease. By the end of the first enrollment period this past March 31, more than 8 million Americans had shopped for and purchased health insurance, nearly 20,000 of them in Delaware County.\n\nThe Health Insurance Marketplace is a product of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, designed to provide a selection of competitively priced policies offered by private insurance companies to millions of Americans without health insurance. A year ago 12 percent of Pennsylvanians lacked health insurance, but the Health Insurance Marketplace in Pennsylvania had to be facilitated federally because Gov. Tom Corbett opted against the state administering it. As of March 31, 318,077 Pennsylvanians had obtained health insurance through the federal marketplace.\n\nHowever, an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 Pennsylvanians fell through the cracks because Corbett also opted against accepting federal Medicaid Expansion funds designed as part of health care reform to provide health insurance for working Americans who earn too much for traditional Medical Assistance but not enough to purchase policies through the Health Insurance Marketplace.\n\nAn opponent of Obama\u0092s health care reform, Corbett insisted his Healthy PA plan was better. He was finally granted a Medicaid waiver by federal officials last month, but his plan, if it is implemented, will not be available until next year. According to the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, it will still not be affordable to many low-income working families and will limit access to critical health services Corbett\u0092s refusal to accept Medicaid expansion funds has not only left hundreds of thousands of working Pennsylvanians without health care coverage, it has left money on the table that could benefit all state residents. A Kaiser Family Foundation study estimated that expanding Medicaid would result in $43 billion in federal money coming into Pennsylvania over a 10-year period and would save Pennsylvania $878 million in uncompensated care costs between 2013 and 2022.\n\nCorbett\u0092s refusal of Medicaid expansion funds has, in fact, shortchanged Pennsylvania hospitals. Officials at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported last week that in the 27 states that accepted expanded Medicaid coverage, admissions of uninsured patients to hospitals have dropped by about 30 percent, resulting in an estimated $5.7 billion reduction in uncompensated hospital care in 2014. That has a domino effect on taxpayers who must shoulder the expense of state reimbursement to hospitals for uncompensated care and for the inflated health insurance premiums uncompensated care fosters.\n\nIt is another piece of the health care reform puzzle which was designed not only to ensure health care coverage for all Americans but to reduce its expense. Medical bills are the second leading cause of bankruptcy in the United States.\n\nAmericans will have their second opportunity at open enrollment in the Health Insurance Marketplace from Nov. 15 to Feb. 15, 2015. Hopefully by this time next year Pennsylvania will have an administration in place that will make the most of all health care reform has to offer its citizens.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Opinion, Opinion news, Primos Opinion news, PA Opinion news, US Opinion news, world Opinion news.", "title": "Editorial: Why Pa. continues to lag behind on health issues", "og": {"url": "http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20140928/NEWS/140929681", "image": {"width": "600px", "identifier": "http://local.delcotimes.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/delcotimes.png?052016", "height": "600px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Editorial: Why Pa. continues to lag behind on health issues"}, "twitter": {"domain": "delcotimes.com", "description": "Without a doubt, the Health Insurance Marketplace got off to a rocky start last Oct. 1.
