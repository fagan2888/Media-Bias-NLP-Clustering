To allow personal opinion to enter into whether an officer will take a post is not something that can be tolerated in a police department,\" Jones told KSL.\n\nShe declined comment on the officer's reason for refusing the assignment.\n\nThe officer, whose name was not released, is on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal affairs investigation.\n\nUtah Pride Center spokeswoman Deann Armes said her group is pleased with the department's stance and thinks officers should undergo sensitivity training before joining the force.\n\n\"Our goal is to make sure that police training and certification includes policies and oaths to ensure that all officers are committed to providing equal service and treatment of all citizens. Clearly, bigotry is alive and well,\" Armes said in a statement.\n\nPolice Chief Chris Burbank has marched in the parade in the past, and three deputy chiefs will march Sunday while he is out of town.\n\nThe department also will have a community outreach and recruitment booth at the pride festival, Jones said, and participates in a standing committee to address public safety issues relating to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender residents.\n\n\"We have gay men and women that serve in the police department,\" Jones told The Salt Lake Tribune. \"One officer's situation does not reflect the vast majority of officers that work in the Salt Lake City Police Department and certainly not Chief Burbank's.\"", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "personal-freedoms", "classification": "/FOX NEWS/US/PERSONAL FREEDOMS/Values", "dcterms.abstract": "A Salt Lake City police officer has been placed on leave after refusing an assignment to work at a gay pride parade.", "twitter": {"description": "A Salt Lake City police officer has been placed on leave after refusing an assignment to work at a gay pride parade.", "title": "Police officer refuses to work at gay pride parade in Utah", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/06/07/police-officer-refuses-to-work-at-gay-pride-parade-in-utah.html", "creator": "@foxnews", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/US/PERSONAL FREEDOMS/Values\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"us/personal-freedoms\",\"title\":\"Police officer refuses to work at gay pride parade in Utah\",\"image_url\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-07T21:02:00Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/06/07/police-officer-refuses-to-work-at-gay-pride-parade-in-utah.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"430e6598-ee8e-42e0-979b-f1ae21649d58\",\"section\":\"us\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "description": "A Salt Lake City police officer has been placed on leave after refusing an assignment to work at a gay pride parade.", "dc.description": "A Salt Lake City police officer has been placed on leave after refusing an assignment to work at a gay pride parade.", "dc.identifier": "430e6598-ee8e-42e0-979b-f1ae21649d58", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "values", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "us", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "Associated Press", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Police Officer Refuses To Work At Gay Pride Parade In Utah", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "A Salt Lake City police officer has been placed on leave after refusing an assignment to work at a gay pride parade.", "title": "Police officer refuses to work at gay pride parade in Utah | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/06/07/police-officer-refuses-to-work-at-gay-pride-parade-in-utah.html", "image": "http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-06-07", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/US/PERSONAL FREEDOMS/Values\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"us/personal-freedoms\",\"title\":\"Police officer refuses to work at gay pride parade in Utah\",\"image_url\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-06-07T21:02:00Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/06/07/police-officer-refuses-to-work-at-gay-pride-parade-in-utah.html\",\"post_id\":\"430e6598-ee8e-42e0-979b-f1ae21649d58\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"us\"}"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc189\"", "article_summary": "A Salt Lake City police officer has been placed on leave after refusing an assignment to work at a gay pride parade.\nThe officer was among about 30 officers assigned to provide traffic control and security for the annual Utah Pride Parade on Sunday in Salt Lake City, said department spokeswoman Lara Jones.\n\"We have gay men and women that serve in the police department,\" Jones told The Salt Lake Tribune.\n\"One officer's situation does not reflect the vast majority of officers that work in the Salt Lake City Police Department and certainly not Chief Burbank's.\"\nThe officer, whose name was not released, is on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal affairs investigation."}
