The Meridian Police Dept. Responded to N. Lakeland Dr. This afternoon after someone called 911 saying her neighbor’s house was being broken into.

"I saw a car drive up. It stayed for a little while and then drove off,” the neighbor says.

The neighbor says two people driving a blue Ford Explorer stopped in the driveway, knocked on the door and then one of them drove off. She then heard someone kicking in the door.

"I saw the car drive off, then I heard them kicking in the door. That's when I called 911," neighbor says.

When police arrived, she says the driver of the car was driving back and she yelled to police. They were able to take him into custody.

"He came back around because he dropped one of the guys off. When he came back around, I hollered to the police that the man who dropped him off was there," the neighbor says.

Police surrounded the house thinking the second suspect was still inside. They brought in a K9 unit and then cleared the house.

"You always have to look out for your neighbor. I hope somebody will for me too,” the neighbor says.
