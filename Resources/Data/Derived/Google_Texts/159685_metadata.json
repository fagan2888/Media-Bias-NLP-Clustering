Anthony List campaigned against Rep. Steve Driehaus of Ohio, who described himself as a \u201cpro-life Democrat.\u201d After Driehaus voted for the Affordable Care Act, conventionally known as ObamaCare, the pro-life organization accused him of supporting taxpayer-funded abortion and considered placing a billboard in his district.\n\nThe billboard was never erected, but Driehaus lost to Republican Steve Chabot in the 2010 midterm elections by seven points.\n\nHe then promptly sued SBA List for \u201closs of livelihood\u201d and cited an Ohio law prohibiting political ads from containing false statements.\n\nSBA List said their allegations were true, that ObamaCare did fund abortion-inducing drugs and otherwise subsidized abortion, and that the law amounted to a state-appointed truth commission.\n\n\u201cThe First Amendment forbids government from acting as a \u2018truth commission\u2019 on matters of public debate,\u201d said Alliance Defending Freedom Senior Counsel Casey Mattox after today's ruling. \u201cThe Sixth Circuit understood that this type of government intrusion has no place under the Constitution. The court was right to affirm, as the district court did, the freedom of Susan B. Anthony List and all the people of Ohio to speak in accordance with their views.\u201d\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy Black, an Obama appointee, allowed Driehaus' lawsuit to move forward in 2011, unleashing a process that saw federal authorities seize the SBA List's computers as \u201cevidence\u201d in June 2012. Black dismissed the case in 2013.\n\nDriehaus then appealed to the Sixth Circuit, which ruled that the pro-life group could not challenge the law.\n\nIn June 2014, the Supreme Court unanimously remanded the case back to a lower district court. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the law could instigate frivolous lawsuits that would chill free speech during elections, and \u201cpetitioners, who intend to criticize candidates for political office, are easy targets.\u201d\n\nA district court then overturned the Ohio state law.\n\nIn today's decision, a panel of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals Court agreed that \u201cOhio fails to screen out frivolous complaints\u201d and targets \u201ccore political speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cSusan B. Anthony List\u2019s goal from the beginning has been to educate voters about the multiple abortion-funding provisions in ObamaCare and expose those elected officials who voted for it,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony List. \u201cEverything we have argued is true. Today is our final victory against the law that chilled our free speech right to speak to the reality of abortion-funding in ObamaCare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "LifeSiteNews", "description": "'Today is our final victory against the law that chilled our free speech,' the group said.", "title": "Federal appeals court sides with pro-life group against Ohio\u2019s \u2018truth commission\u2019 law", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/lifesite/california_bully_bill.jpg", "url": "https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/federal-appeals-court-sides-with-pro-life-group-against-ohios-truth-commisi", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "'Today is our final victory against the law that chilled our free speech,' the group said."}, "description": "'Today is our final victory against the law that chilled our free speech,' the group said.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 132010293551131, "pages": 112623813202}}, "article_summary": "In June 2014, the Supreme Court unanimously remanded the case back to a lower district court.\nHe then promptly sued SBA List for \u201closs of livelihood\u201d and cited an Ohio law prohibiting political ads from containing false statements.\nDriehaus then appealed to the Sixth Circuit, which ruled that the pro-life group could not challenge the law.\nSBA List said their allegations were true, that ObamaCare did fund abortion-inducing drugs and otherwise subsidized abortion, and that the law amounted to a state-appointed truth commission.\nThe billboard was never erected, but Driehaus lost to Republican Steve Chabot in the 2010 midterm elections by seven points."}
