Men and women will occupy separate rooms but use unisex restrooms. The center has its own kitchen, a laundry room and a lounge.\n\n\n\nEven as officials await a city certificate of occupancy and an inspection by the state fire marshal, \u201calready people are calling in wanting to make a reservation,\u201d said Peter Casey, executive director of Peninsula Behavioral Health.\n\n\n\nIt will run the center in quarters once occupied by the St. Vincent de Paul thrift store next to its headquarters, 118 E. Eighth St.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a hotel,\u201d he explained, but a place where people undergoing mental health crises can seek shelter, counseling and medication if needed.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe wanted to make it homey but not too comfortable. We don\u2019t want people to want to stay here.\u201d\n\n\n\nWendy Sisk, the center\u2019s clinical director and a former supervisor of crisis services, added: \u201cIt\u2019s for people who have an intense need at the time.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow many patients will occupy the center at any given time is unpredictable, she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe will have to play it by ear,\u201d Sisk said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have an ebb and flow.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe floors of each room are polished concrete. The walls are beige and hung with artwork gathered from several sources, Sisk said.\n\n\n\nPhotographs on display were taken by three behavioral staff members. One evocative image shows a wooded path into the distance, a symbolic road to recovery.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d stay here,\u201d Sisk said about the surroundings. \u201cThat\u2019s what all our staff are saying.\u201d\n\n\n\nEntrance to the center will be from the north side to lessen its visibility to the center\u2019s Ninth Street neighbors, Casey said, and \u201chave minimum impact\u201d on the neighborhood.\n\n\n\nOne group that\u2019s been enthusiastic about the center is the local chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey were out here in force\u201d at a Dec. 3 open house at the center, Casey said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey know their loved ones will be able to get care here instead of somewhere else.\u201d\n\nPORT ANGELES \u2014 When turmoil roils a person\u2019s mind, there\u2019ll soon be a new safe harbor from the storm.Peninsula Behavioral Health plans to open a respite center next to its headquarters at 118 E. Eighth St. next week, a six-bed facility that mental health advocates have sought for decades.\u201cThey were working on this way back in the \u201980s,\u201d said Lorraine Wall, director of nursing at Olympic Medical Center, whose emergency department will benefit from the new refuge.The Clallam County Respite Center \u2014 to which admission is strictly voluntary \u2014 will allow clients to seek residential treatment for mental health crises, said Peter Casey, Peninsula Behavioral Health executive director.For Wall, that means people can get help before they become threats to their own health or to others and thus be involuntarily detained.OMC can detain such patients up to 72 hours before transferring them to a full-time mental health center such as Kitsap Mental Health Services in Bremerton.\u201cThe idea [of the respite center] is that they don\u2019t get to that point,\u201d she said Thursday, but instead receive medication and counseling. \u201cThat will greatly benefit those individuals.\u201dIt also will give law enforcement officers an alternative to jailing people who are having mental health crises.Clallam County Sheriff Bill Benedict told the Peninsula Daily News, \u201cThe headline should read: \u2018The sheriff said the respite center is awesome.\u2019 \u201dHe noted, however, that it wouldn\u2019t divert from jail those people \u201cwho prove to be unmanageable,\u201d nor was it a lockdown facility.Costs per bed per day, he said, would be roughly the same at the respite center as at the Clallam County jail.Still, \u201cfor those people who follow the rules and do want to assist in their rehabilitation, I think that\u2019s great,\u201d Benedict added.Those clients probably would include offenders diverted to the center through Mental Health Court, he said.Other referrals will come from private doctors and through recommendations from OMC\u2019s emergency department.Some, said Wendy Sisk, Peninsula Behavioral Health clinical director, would simply walk in.The center can accept people who live between the east end of Lake Crescent to the Jefferson County line. People who live farther west are clients of West End Outreach.Port Angeles Police Chief Terry Gallagher recalled when then-Olympic Memorial Hospital had \u201cwhat we called a behavioral medicine ward\u201d where police could drop off people in crisis.It closed for budgetary reasons in 1989, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s been a sorely missed resource all these years by law enforcement personnel,\u201d he said.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a need for it in this community.\u201dCarla Jacobi, police records specialist, said this year has seen 180 mental health hospitalizations from Port Angeles police under the Involuntary Treatment Act for mentally disordered people taken into protective custody.Both Benedict and Gallagher lamented that police, deputies and other first responders are pressed into dispensing mental health care.\u201cOur mental health system is broken,\u201d Gallagher said. \u201cA good indicator of that is how often police are searching for solutions to what should be medical concerns, not law enforcement.\u201cI\u2019m excited to see a different resource in this area.\u201d\u201cThose of us who have had family members in crisis and had them sent as far away as Yakima or Bellingham for treatment truly appreciate this center and the people who made it a reality,\u201d said Margi Ahlgren, board member with the Clallam County chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\u201cFamilies are essential in a treatment team and usually want to be with the son, daughter, parent or spouse whose brain is sick, just as if the heart, lungs or any part of the body were ill. This center makes that possible in most situations.\u201cNAMI of Clallam County is a voice for families, and we thank our community leaders and Peninsula Behavioral Health staff for their humane and diligent work.\u201dThe respite center joins the 19-bed Arlene Engel Home residential center, and discussions are underway to develop a drop-off detox center for people overdosed on drugs or alcohol.For Peninsula Behavioral Health, a major benefit of the respite center will be treating patients in Port Angeles and not having to send them to Bremerton or Western State Hospital in Lakewood.\u201cThe more money that we have to sped on [out-of-town] hospitalizations, the less we have for outpatient services here,\u201d Casey said.The Affordable Care Act, Casey said, has boosted the number of people seeking mental health help.Since Jan. 1, Peninsula Behavioral Health has added 790 clients due to the expansion of Medicaid services under the act.Meanwhile, eastern Clallam County is allowed to fill seven beds at Western State Hospital. One is reserved for West End Outreach.If the agencies\u2019 patients occupy more than their allocated beds, the state fines the mental health organizations.Initial design of the respite center began about a year ago, Casey said.It cost $370,000 to turn the old thrift store-turned-Eagles Lodge into a mental health facility with funds from the state, OMC, Clallam County and community donations.________Reporter James Casey can be reached at 360-452-2345, ext. 5074, or at jcasey@peninsuladailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "port angeles newspaper, sequim newspaper, port townsend newspaper, olympic peninsula newspaper, daily news, port angeles classifieds, sequim classifieds, port townsend classifieds, local weather, local news, olympic peninsula obituaries, port angeles obituaries, sequim obituaries, port townsend obituaries,pdn,port angeles,sequim,port townsend,olympic peninsula", "og": {"url": "http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/article/20141219/NEWS/312199976", "site_name": "Peninsula Daily News", "image": "http://www.peninsuladailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=PT&Date=20141219&Category=news&ArtNo=312199976&Ref=AR", "type": "article", "title": "New respite center to offer help for mental health crises"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002304548680, "app_id": 224084277650041}, "description": "Your #1 News Source for the Olympic Peninsula, Port Angeles, Sequim, Port Townsend and beyond."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea1d\"", "article_summary": "New respite center to offer help for mental health crisesBy James CaseyPeninsula Daily NewsIt\u2019s homey but \u2018it\u2019s not a hotel\u2019PORT ANGELES \u2014 No one would mistake it for home, but the Clallam County Respite Center is homey.\n\u201cThey were out here in force\u201d at a Dec. 3 open house at the center, Casey said.\nOne group that\u2019s been enthusiastic about the center is the local chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\nEven as officials await a city certificate of occupancy and an inspection by the state fire marshal, \u201calready people are calling in wanting to make a reservation,\u201d said Peter Casey, executive director of Peninsula Behavioral Health.\nThe center has its own kitchen, a laundry room and a lounge."}
