China has failed in many of these areas, and instead depends far too heavily on reckless lending by state banks and manipulating its currency to accomplish artificial cost competitiveness and boost export revenues.\n\nAs Japan demonstrated in the 1980s, this is not sustainable policy and now the bubble has burst.\n\nChinese factory output is at its weakest level in seven years. As investors flee, China\u2019s growth is slowing dramatically and its financial systems are crashing. Over the summer, the Shanghai market lost nearly 40 percent, creating shockwaves across global markets\u2014vivid proof that China\u2019s \u201cmiracle economy\u201d poses grave risks to the broader global economy.\n\nIn response, the People's Bank of China has cut interest rates to record lows, and announced plans to buy record levels of Chinese stocks, while essentially suspending new share listings.\n\nAnd then there is China\u2019s intervention in the currency markets. On August 11, the Yuan dropped 1.9 percent in value, the largest daily devaluation in over 20 years. By the end of that week, the Yuan had depreciated by about 4 percent.\n\nAs China struggles to right its economic ship, we must not allow China to artificially suppress the value of the Yuan. China is stealing would-be American jobs \u2014 by creating lower prices for its exports and higher prices for goods imported into China. This unfairly places our businesses and those in other nations at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nForeign currency manipulation, more than any other subsidy, has unfairly hollowed out the U.S. manufacturing base. We\u2019ve all seen hard-working American workers unfairly laid off \u2014 as world-class competitive American plants shut-down because of unfair foreign currency manipulation. The resultant over $350 billion annual trade deficit with China is costing Americans 3 million good-paying jobs. We say enough!\n\nWhile Congress failed to include currency manipulation enforcement in the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) that became law this past July, there is still an opportunity to include enforceable rules against currency manipulation in the Trans Pacific partnership (TPP) to be debated in the coming months. All free trade proponents should support this.\n\nEx-Fed Chairman Paul Volcker once said: \u201cTrade is more affected by ten minutes of movements in exchange rates than by ten years of trade negotiations.\u201d We agree. Without free trade in currencies, free and fair trade in goods is simply impossible. To set and enforce rules to halt currency manipulations, we must understand the methods employed.\n\nCurrency manipulation is not always a textbook, persistent, blatant, one-way intervention by a nation in currency markets \u2014 but involves other complex and multi-faceted maneuvers. This is the case with the Chinese Yuan.\n\nWere the Yuan permitted to float freely and without limits, its value against the dollar, like the euro and other currencies, would be determined by the sum of its current account balance \u2014 the difference between exports and imports \u2014 and its capital account balance \u2014 the difference between inward and outward foreign investment. A positive sum \u2014 or balance of payments surplus \u2014 creates an excess demand for the currency; raising the Yuan\u2019s value. A negative sum creates an excess supply for the currency, reducing the Yuan\u2019s value.\n\nFor the most part during recent years, China\u2019s current and capital account balances should have increased the value of the Yuan. But China\u2019s policies of controlling foreign exchange transactions, its official and surrogate intervention in currency markets, and its regulations restricting inward foreign investment \u2014 have frustrated market forces and kept the Yuan arbitrarily weak. Despite persistent balance of payments surpluses, and strong desires of foreign companies to invest in China, the Yuan has remained fixed at about 6.20 to the dollar.\n\nTo understand this, let\u2019s consider how China restricts Yuan convertibility for capital account purposes.\n\nForeign enterprises, investing directly in China to produce goods and services, are limited to a maximum 50 percent ownership. Multinationals, like GM and Apple, are required to take local Chinese joint venture partners. Additionally, China places crippling restrictions on foreign investors, limiting their ability to purchase Chinese stock and bonds.\n\nIn addition, China encourages capital flight via Chinese investments into other nations.\n\nWithout these policies, net capital flows into China and demand for its currency would increase \u2014 resulting in a more market-based, higher valuation of the Yuan.\n\nWhile Beijing\u2019s severe limitations on inward foreign investment and stock/bond purchases are not direct monetary interventions, they have the same impact as textbook currency manipulation. China is not allowing market forces to determine the exchange rate for its currency.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. and most of our trading partners have far more open policies toward foreign investment and market access. If Beijing permitted foreign investors the same market access that Chinese businesses enjoy abroad; if China ended its official/surrogate intervention and allowed the Yuan to trade freely \u2014 China\u2019s capital account balance would increase dramatically \u2014 and the Yuan would likely be 20 percent to 30 percent higher than its current value.\n\nIf China continues to prevent fair market valuation of the Yuan, we might see dangerous responses elsewhere. As demand for Chinese exports increase, and demand by the Chinese for more imported goods decrease, other countries will be inclined to adjust monetary policies to offset the impact. The U.S. may delay raising interest rates, to prevent an even stronger dollar. Unless China\u2019s behavior is corrected, we could see a currency war.\n\nWe need to prevent and respond to foreign currency manipulation \u2014 and reverse the erosion of the American manufacturing base. Let's give our world-class companies and workers a chance to compete fairly \u2014 and bring critical manufacturing jobs back to America. We like our chances on a level playing field.\n\nClawson has represented Florida\u2019s 19th Congressional District since 2014 and is the former CEO of automotive wheel manufacturer Hayes Lemmerz International.
