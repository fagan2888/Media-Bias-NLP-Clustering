But questions have arisen about the actions of the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), which, through its Small Business Legal Center, is part of an amici curiae (\u201cfriends of the court\u201d) brief filed on behalf of the defendants in California\u2019s 6th Appellate District Court of Appeal in San Jose.\n\nWhy is NFIB, which reports that most of its member businesses employ only three to five workers, going to bat for the case\u2019s three multinational corporate defendants?\n\nIn December 2013, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge James Kleinberg ordered ConAgra, Sherwin-Williams and National Lead (NL Industries) to pay $1.15 billion to three California cities and seven counties,including Los Angeles County, to abate lead paint hazards in 3.5 million homes built before 1978. The companies were three of the five largest manufacturers and sellers of lead pigment and paints in the U.S. during the 20th century and, ruled Judge Kleinberg, they knew their products were harmful before lead-based paint was banned from the market in 1978, but continued to make and sell them for use inside homes.\n\nAngelo Bellomo, Los Angeles County\u2019s Environmental Health Director, said lead paint remains a real hazard today.\n\n\u201cRoughly 1.5 million homes in the county built before 1978 more than likely contain lead-based paint,\u201d Bellomo told Capital & Main. Many of those homes are located in low-income neighborhoods. \u201cWe believe that throughout the county, 3,500 children each year have blood screening levels at or above the CDC [Centers for Disease Control] reference. Rather than waiting until our blood level screening program tells us we have a burdened child, the judgment will provide the funding necessary to abate that hazard.\u201d\n\nThe NFIB, however, remains adamantly opposed to Judge Kleinberg\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWe disagree with the decision that there is a public nuisance and are concerned that it creates new liabilities for small business property owners and manufacturers,\u201d said senior federation counsel Luke Wake. \u201cThe decision opens up a Pandora\u2019s box for potential lawsuits against anyone who owns an older building that may happen to have some trace amount of lead paint in it. If there is a health and safety issue, it should be addressed by the legislature.\u201d\n\nThis opinion is identical to that spread by the California Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse (CALA). In April, in \u201cAn Open Letter to the County Counsel Association of California, then-CALA executive director Tom Scott called Judge Kleinberg\u2019s ruling \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201ccockamamie.\u201d CALA\u2019s leaders say the \u201cinfamous\u201d lawsuit \u201cwill only benefit trial attorneys\u201d and \u201cnot result in any meaningful public health benefit.\u201d\n\nAlso in April, Scott\u2019s op-ed in the Monterey Herald criticized the lawsuit in regard to fixing pressing public safety issues. \u201cThere isn\u2019t one,\u201d he said of such issues.\n\nCALA, whose national parent is Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse, describes itself as \u201ca nonpartisan grassroots movement of concerned citizens and businesses who are fighting against lawsuit abuse in California.\u201d CALA \u2013whose members are \u201cmostly small businesses,\u201d according to its Southern California regional director, Maryann Marino \u2013 is focused on the Americans With Disabilities Act and lobbying against a state Assembly bill to protect workers against forced arbitration excesses. The Center for Justice & Democracy-Public Citizen reported that CALA and similar groups were created two decades ago with help from big tobacco companies to \u201cact as mouthpieces for anti-consumer tort law changes.\u201d\n\nCALA and the NFIB\u2019s shared opposition to the lead paint abatement lawsuit may not be coincidental \u2013 in July Tom Scott left CALA to become the NFIB\u2019s California director. When asked by Capital & Main about the health benefits of the court-ordered removal of lead paint, Scott spoke from his historical CALA vantage point, claiming that only the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers will benefit from Judge Kleinberg\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cThe trial lawyers are getting 17 percent,\u201d he said. \u201cThe counties and the cities are going to be left with a mess to deal with. And residents, whether there\u2019s lead paint \u2014 some would argue leaving it, if it is underneath five coats. Do you really want to remove it? What\u2019s that going to cost?\u201d\n\nScott was clear about the kind of civil litigation represented by the lead paint case. \u201cI don\u2019t think cities and counties ought to be suing the private sector,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI don\u2019t think [they] should be hiring contingency lawyers. As far as I am concerned, taxation through litigation is just not what the cities and counties should be in the business of. Whether it\u2019s lead paint or Orange County suing the opiate industry, it\u2019s just a bad avenue to be going down.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"mom and pop\" business group is fighting California's lead paint ruling on behalf of three corporate defendants.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-09-02 14:42:14 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The \"mom and pop\" business group is fighting California's lead paint ruling on behalf of three corporate defendants.", "title": "Group That Claims To Represent Small Businesses Goes To Bat For Corporations In Lead Paint Case", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/group-that-claims-to-represent-small-businesses-goes-to-bat-for-corporations-in-lead-paint-case_us_55e5ee6ce4b0b7a9633a7050", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/55e5ef0f1400002e002e49e5.jpeg?cache=c9vzzj8igj", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/55e5ef0f1400002e002e49e5.jpeg?cache=c9vzzj8igj", "height": 1000}, "title": "Group That Claims To Represent Small Businesses Goes To Bat For Corporations In Lead Paint Case", "description": "The \"mom and pop\" business group is fighting California's lead paint ruling on behalf of three corporate defendants.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostPol"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-01 14:42:14 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_55e5ee6ce4b0b7a9633a7050", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "lead,lead paint, california politics,capital & main,nfib,national federation of independent business", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "lead,lead paint, california politics,capital & main,nfib,national federation of independent business", "published_time": "2015-09-01 14:42:14 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-09-01 14:43:18 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "What\u2019s that going to cost?\u201dScott was clear about the kind of civil litigation represented by the lead paint case.\nAngelo Bellomo, Los Angeles County\u2019s Environmental Health Director, said lead paint remains a real hazard today.\nWhether it\u2019s lead paint or Orange County suing the opiate industry, it\u2019s just a bad avenue to be going down.\u201d\nAnd residents, whether there\u2019s lead paint \u2014 some would argue leaving it, if it is underneath five coats.\nA nationwide group of self-described small and independent business owners has joined the legal battle to appeal California\u2019s landmark lead paint court ruling."}
