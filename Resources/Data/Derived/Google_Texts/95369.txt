And you thought your Sunday was a good one.

Nuggets owner Stan Kroenke had himself a day as well – a winning one. Kroenke, who also owns the NFL’s St. Louis Rams, was in the Show Me State to watch the Rams pick up one of their biggest victories of the season, 27-16, over New Orleans.

Then he traveled back to Denver in time to see the finishing touches of the Nuggets’ win over the Pelicans in person. Two games. Two wins over New Orleans.

One happy day for Kroenke.

Rolling to the basket. As far as Nuggets guard Ty Lawson was concerned, J.J. Hickson’s 19 points and 11 rebounds against the Pelicans was built on one simple foundation – rolling to the basket on pick-and-rolls.

The two have lockers right next to each other, and after the game Lawson took full advantage of Hickson’s close proximity, lightheartedly jabbing at him during his own post-game press conference.

“I guess it’s not fly to roll to the basket,” Lawson said, smiling. “He don’t like rolling; he wants to look fly.”

Lawson turned serious.

“He played well, 19 and 11,” Lawson said. “He controlled the paint, controlled the boards and we need him to do that every night.”

What did Hickson have to say about all of this?

“I think my percentages show that when I roll to the basket I’m an effective player,” Hickson said. “Ty does a good job finding me on the roll and puts me in a good position to score baskets.”

Taking the challenge. Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said he challenged his starters to raise their level of play, particularly at the beginning of games.

That message was heard loud and clear, guard Ty Lawson said.

“The challenge he gave us was crazy,” Lawson said. “He put everything on blast. You’ve got to respond to that, being a competitor, you have to respond. We all took it to heart, we just had to get better and we did.”
