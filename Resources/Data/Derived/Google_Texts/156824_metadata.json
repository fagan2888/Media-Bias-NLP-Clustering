This could help the company find other financing opportunities, Moody's Investors Service Inc said in a research note in December.\n\nSome creditors are resisting the stock move. On Monday, iHeartMedia received a default notice from holders of its priority guarantee notes who argue that the stock move was a default. Those holders could call all their debt due in 60 days, and trigger defaults on the company's other debt.\n\nBefore receiving the notice, iHeartMedia, based in San Antonio, Texas, filed a lawsuit in State District Court in Bexar County, Texas, asking for a ruling stating that the company is not in default or in violation of credit agreements.\n\nThe company, which is controlled by private equity firms Bain Capital Partners LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, is asking for a temporary restraining order that would prevent the holders from declaring their debt due and payable immediately.\n\nPolitical ad spending for the U.S. presidential election is expected to help iHeartMedia this year. However, while iHeartMedia has no issue meeting its near-term liabilities, it remains under pressure to reduce its burdensome debt load.\n\nAs of the end of December, iHeartMedia owned 861 domestic radio stations serving more than 150 U.S. markets, including 44 of the top 50 markets.\n\n(This version of the story corrects 9th paragraph to show iHeartMedia filed lawsuit before receiving notice from note holders, not after)\n\n(Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli and Greg Roumeliotis in New York; editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Dan Grebler)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "(Reuters) - iHeartMedia Inc has hired Moelis & Co as a financial adviser, the most", "title": "iHeartMedia hires Moelis to tackle debt burden - sources", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/08/Exclusive-iHeartMedia-hires-Moelis-tackle-debt-burden-sources", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-entertainment_4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/08/Exclusive-iHeartMedia-hires-Moelis-tackle-debt-burden-sources", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-entertainment_4.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "(Reuters) - iHeartMedia Inc has hired Moelis & Co as a financial adviser, the most", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "On Monday, iHeartMedia received a default notice from holders of its priority guarantee notes who argue that the stock move was a default.\niHeartMedia, which is also the majority owner of U.S. billboard operator Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc, and Moelis declined to comment.\nThose holders could call all their debt due in 60 days, and trigger defaults on the company's other debt.\niHeartMedia has been locked in a battle with its senior creditors after it moved Clear Channel Outdoor stock to another subsidiary, Broader Media LLC.\nHowever, while iHeartMedia has no issue meeting its near-term liabilities, it remains under pressure to reduce its burdensome debt load."}
