I grew up in a car-averse household in Toronto, and on mornings when most kids were being driven to school, my parents told me to bundle up and get on my bike. I didn\u2019t like it at the time, but thanks to them, I\u2019ve never seen cold weather as a reason not to ride.\n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing\u2014though many commuters can\u2019t imagine making the trip to work without climate control, I\u2019m not alone in my determination to keep riding, no matter the road conditions. Across the United States, many of the cities that boast the highest percentage of bike commuters are also known for nasty winters\u2014places like Minneapolis and Madison, Wisconsin. Warm-weather cities like Austin and San Diego, where the sun always seems to shine, have far fewer regular riders.\n\nIt\u2019s a puzzling phenomenon, but less so when you consider which cities have extensive bike lanes and actively promote cycling, explains Caroline Szczepanski, a spokesperson for the League of American Bicyclists.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is that weather actually isn\u2019t much of an issue if there\u2019s a strong bike culture,\u201d she says.\n\nMinneapolis, for instance, has a phenomenal trail system, downtown bike share, and tons of organized events like bike-to-work days and group rides. Urban planning makes a difference, too. If the nearest grocery store is 10 miles away, you\u2019re less likely to hop on your bike\u2014regardless if it\u2019s 5 degrees or 100.\n\nEven in New York City, and with the help of a city-wide bike sharing program, more and more riders seem ready and willing to brave the elements. On January 7, NYC temperatures plummeted to 4 degrees Fahrenheit, the coldest day on record since 1896. That same day, CITI Bike proudly announced via Twitter that the bike share program had logged 6,669 trips. That number is far below the daily average of 35,000, sure, but it\u2019s still evidence that not everyone sees a frozen thermostat and heads for the subway.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you live in a city with a strong bike culture, you're undeterred by the elements -- even the cold and the snow", "title": "Why I biked through the polar vortex (no, I\u2019m not crazy)", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "If you live in a city with a strong bike culture, you're undeterred by the elements -- even the cold and the snow", "title": "Why I biked through the polar vortex (no, I\u2019m not crazy)", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/23/a_shocking_number_of_people_biked_to_work_in_4_degree_weather_heres_why_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/shutterstock_147987338.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you live in a city with a strong bike culture, you're undeterred by the elements -- even the cold and the snow", "title": "Why I biked through the polar vortex (no, I\u2019m not crazy)", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/shutterstock_147987338.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Tory", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Benefits, biking, Environment, life, OnEarth.org, Snow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdba1\"", "article_summary": "That same day, CITI Bike proudly announced via Twitter that the bike share program had logged 6,669 trips.\nMinneapolis, for instance, has a phenomenal trail system, downtown bike share, and tons of organized events like bike-to-work days and group rides.\nYeah, I\u2019m one of those crazy bikers who choose to pedal no matter what the weather.\nEven in New York City, and with the help of a city-wide bike sharing program, more and more riders seem ready and willing to brave the elements.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve found is that weather actually isn\u2019t much of an issue if there\u2019s a strong bike culture,\u201d she says."}
