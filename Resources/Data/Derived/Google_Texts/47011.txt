Days before Liz Cheney sparred with her sister over gay marriage, the Wyoming Senate candidate lamented a separate issue that could be "dangerous" for the Republican Party.

In a Nov. 12 Q&A with TIME published on Thursday, Cheney was asked about a variety of topics, from how the GOP handled its attempts to defund Obamacare, to differences between her and incumbent Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.).

The question that appeared to strike a strong chord was on foreign policy -- specifically if the GOP was veering away from tactics long supported by her and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney.

TIME: The Republican Party is turning away from the brand of foreign policy that you and your father have long espoused. Is that a danger for the Republican Party?

Cheney: I think that yes, it is dangerous. I think isolationism is a mistake, no matter what party you see it in. We have to remember that there are two threats to our freedom: there’s a threat that comes from the federal government, from the Obama Administration policies..but there’s also a huge and significant threat from al-Qaeda. The war on terror is still underway. Al-Qaeda is stronger today than it’s been in many years. We have to be able to protect our freedom from both of those threats.
