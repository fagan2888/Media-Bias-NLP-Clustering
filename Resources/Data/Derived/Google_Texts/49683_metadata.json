Every kind of war you can imagine \u2026 because they recognize there is strength in our unity,\u201d Carson told more than 200 people at a rally Tuesday afternoon in Cedar Rapids.\n\nThe rally was part of the retired neurosurgeon\u2019s first day on the Iowa caucus campaign trail after formally entering the race for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination Monday in his hometown of Detroit.\n\nCarson won frequent applause during his 22-minute speech that touched on federal government overreach, taxation, replacing the health care law, policing and the military.\n\nHowever, his audience wasn\u2019t sure how to take Carson when he talked about his childhood and running from the police \u201cback in the days before they would shoot you.\u201d\n\nThat was greeted with a mixture of laughter and \u201cooh.\u201d\n\nHe quickly followed up with a call for support for police and rejection of the people \u201cstoking up this division\u201d that, Carson said, would lead to more militarization of police departments.\n\nLisa McGrath of Cedar Rapids liked his sometimes lighthearted approach to serious issues.\n\n\u201cAfter today, I\u2019m a supporter,\u201d she said.\n\nShe liked his solution to the Affordable Care Act. Carson called for replacing Obamacare with health savings accounts that would begin at birth and could be passed on to family members.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want the government in control of the most important thing you have, which is your health and your health care,\u201d Carson said to applause. \u201cIf they have control of your health care, everything else is secondary \u2026 they\u2019ve got the most important thing.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the day, Carson visited the Capitol in Des Moines where he said he plans to spend a lot of time in Iowa getting to know voters and what\u2019s on their minds.\n\n\u201cAnd if anyone has good solutions, I want to hear them,\u201d Carson said.\n\nNever having run for office will be an advantage and help him stand out in a growing field of GOP candidates, he said.\n\nPoliticians, he said, \u201chave a tendency to be political and always have their finger in the air and seeing which way the wind is blowing and to try to say the right things.\u201d\n\nRobert Heath of Cedar Rapids liked that and a lot of what Carson said, but \u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019s my No. 1.\u201d\n\nLikewise, retired banker Steve Menzner of Marion applauded many of Carson\u2019s ideas, but said the question is \u201cCan he do this, can he get these things enacted?\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s outsider talk \u201cmay get him headlines in a crowded GOP field,\u201d Sam Lau of the Iowa Democratic Party said, \u201cbut his positions fail to separate him from a Republican Party that gets more extreme each and every day.\u201d\n\nCedar Rapids area residents will have the opportunity to see two other GOP hopefuls Thursday when Carly Fiorina has a meet-and-greet at 7:30 a.m. at Blue Strawberry, 118 Second St. SE, and Mike Huckabee has a gathering at 4:30 p.m. at Pizza Ranch, 2450 Westdale Drive SW.\n\nErin Murphy of The Gazette-Lee Des Moines Bureau contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | CEDAR RAPIDS - When presidential candidate Ben Carson says he's not a politician, he seems to be distancing himself from what he calls the 'purveyors of d", "og": {"site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "CEDAR RAPIDS - When presidential candidate Ben Carson says he's not a politician, he seems to be distancing himself from what he calls the 'purveyors of division' who try to 'separate us, to make us into enemies.'", "url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/carson-wants-to-get-to-know-iowans-20150505", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20150505/ARTICLE/150509846/EP/1/9/EP-150509846.jpg", "article": {"section": "News"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/carson-wants-to-get-to-know-iowans-20150505", "description": "CEDAR RAPIDS - When presidential candidate Ben Carson says he's not a politician, he seems to be distancing himself from what he calls the 'purveyors of division' who try to 'separate us, to make us into enemies.'", "site": "@gazettedotcom", "title": "Ben Carson wants to get to know Iowans as presidential candidate"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"modDate": "2015-05-05T19:47:00-05:00", "type": "thegazette_news", "pubDate": "2015-05-05T11:47:53-05:00", "title": "Ben Carson wants to get to know Iowans as presidential candidate"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd515\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI don\u2019t want the government in control of the most important thing you have, which is your health and your health care,\u201d Carson said to applause.\nLisa McGrath of Cedar Rapids liked his sometimes lighthearted approach to serious issues.\nCarson won frequent applause during his 22-minute speech that touched on federal government overreach, taxation, replacing the health care law, policing and the military.\nEvery kind of war you can imagine \u2026 because they recognize there is strength in our unity,\u201d Carson told more than 200 people at a rally Tuesday afternoon in Cedar Rapids.\nCarson called for replacing Obamacare with health savings accounts that would begin at birth and could be passed on to family members."}
