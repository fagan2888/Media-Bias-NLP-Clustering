He says he will build a wall and Mexico will pay for it. \u201cIt\u2019ll be so easy,\u201d Trump says. Trump says our tax code incentivizes companies to leave the country and he wonders if \u201cwe have anybody\u201d who wants to send a delegation to keep companies like Carrier in the United States.\n\n[And\u2026. another commercial break\u2026 seems like there have been more commercial breaks for Fox to run commercials than previous town halls.]\n\n@greta my god can you possibly have more commercial breaks for Trump town hall?? \u2014 Michael (@ChiMike1) April 4, 2016\n\n@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump @greta You have to many commercials for town hall, very disappointed.

Trump says we have to \u201cknock out ISIS\u201d and the cheapest thing to do is to make your military bigger, better, and stronger than ever before. Trump says he was right when he said NATO was \u201cobsolete\u201d and not focused on terrorism. Trump says we have to go Japan, Korea, Saudi Arabia and say we need to be properly reimbursed for our defense.

He notes that the manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin are \u201cway, way down.\u201d\n\n8:15: Trump says he gets politicians to do what they\u2019re going to do.

Trump says Obamacare is a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d but \u201cwe\u2019re going to take care of people\u201d because \u201cwe\u2019re going to have great health care for a lot less money.\u201d He says Obamacare\u2019s deductibles are too high and his reforms will have \u201ca lot of options.\u201d Trump says insurance companies like Obamacare and talks about getting rid of the \u201cboundary lines\u201d around the states and he will do so because he is self-funding his campaign.
