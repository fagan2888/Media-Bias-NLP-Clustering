The Galaxy Health program, which debuted at Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center (LAC+USC) in 2012, proved that intuitive and inexpensive interventions improve patient care and physician and staff morale.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the report (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nMedical home model boots patient, staff satisfaction\n\nStudy: Even small steps toward medical homes improve care\n\nSpecialty medical home expects millions in savings\n\nJoint Commission offers new medical home certification\n\nMost practices lack infrastructure to become medical homes", "article_metadata": {"description": "A\u00a0patient-centered medical home\u00a0(PCMH) model resulted in reduced costs of care, unnecessary emergency room (ER) and hospital visits, and improved population health, according to a research\u00a0report\u00a0by the\u00a0Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "A\u00a0patient-centered medical home\u00a0(PCMH) model resulted in reduced costs of care, unnecessary emergency room (ER) and hospital visits, and improved population health, according to a research\u00a0report\u00a0by the\u00a0Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative.", "title": "Report: PCMH model leads to reduced cost of care, improved population health", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/report-pcmh-model-leads-reduced-cost-care-improved-population-health/2014-01-15", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Accountable Care Organizations,Care Delivery,patient-centered medical homes,Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative,PCMH", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3cc0\"", "article_summary": "A patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model resulted in reduced costs of care, unnecessary emergency room (ER) and hospital visits, and improved population health, according to a research report by the Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative.\nThe Galaxy Health program, which debuted at Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center (LAC+USC) in 2012, proved that intuitive and inexpensive interventions improve patient care and physician and staff morale.\nThe PCMH model is also being incorporated into significant payment reforms, including Congressional reforms to the Medicare sustainable growth rate, which would aid in moving the U.S. healthcare system away from fee-for-service toward alternative payment methods, including ones build around the PCMH model, according to the report.\nImprovements in population-health indicators and preventive services: 31 percent of peer-reviewed studies and 29 percent of industry-generated studies saw better controlled HbA1c, blood pressure and LDL levels, as well as an increase in screening and immunization rates.\nThe report also found PCMHs play a role in strengthening the larger healthcare systems, especially accountable care organizations."}
