Casey Hugelfink, CC BY-SA 2.0.\n\nAs the debate over whether fracking is both a lucrative and safe method of gas and oil extraction rages on, the Environmental Protection Agency finally offered a pretty inconclusive response on allegations of water contamination near fracking sites: Yes, fracking has contaminated water supplies in some instances, but those instances were few in comparison to the breadth of the industry.\n\nThe draft report, which analyzed the 950 papers, technical reports and published studies that Congress had requested, declared that five key components of the fracking process had contaminated drinking water, but this \u201cwas small compared to the number of hydraulically fractured wells.\u201d The EPA emphasized that from the beginning of their investigation, their intent was not to determine whether fracking was hazardous to human health or to environmental health, nor did they intend to analyze impacts of fracking on air quality or its possible contribution to greenhouse emissions. The report is still subject to review by the EPA\u2019s panel of scientists.\n\n\u201cThis is a study of how we can best protect our water resources,\u201d said Tom Burke, deputy assistant administrator of the EPA\u2019s Office of Research and Development to U.S. News. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of safe or unsafe. It\u2019s a question of understanding vulnerabilities so that we can address those vulnerabilities, practice hydraulic fracturing in the safest way possible to reduce those risks, and protect our water resources.\u201d\n\nIt is clear from responses to the draft report\u2019s claims that researchers from the EPA were seeking to find a middle ground, as both sides of the debate have been largely supportive of its conclusions.\n\nAccording to Alaskan Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican and supporter of fracking, this report lays out the claims her side has been making all along. \u201cToday\u2019s study confirms what we already know. Hydraulic fracturing, when done to industry standards, does not impact drinking water,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, those opposed to fracking are finding their argument in the report as well. The Sierra Club, similarly, said the report \u201cconfirms what millions of Americans already know \u2014 that dirty oil and gas fracking contaminates drinking water.\u201d\n\nAlthough the process of fracking, which frees up underground stores of oil and gas deposits, has become a major source of American energy, creating 25,000 to 30,000 wells per year since 2011, the health and environmental repercussions are still unclear. What is clear, though, is the advantages of fracking to the American energy industry. \u201cHydraulic fracturing has been used safely in over a million wells, resulting in America\u2019s rise as a global energy superpower, growth in energy investments, wages and new jobs,\u201d says Erik Milito of the American Petroleum Institute, one of the largest lobbying groups for the oil and gas industry.\n\nHowever, for those living near fracking sites, especially in northeastern Pennsylvania, it is not an issue of jobs or revenue, but of the safety of the water their families are drinking. In early May, a study linked water contamination in Dimock PA with a nearby fracking well, one of many instances in the epicenter of the natural gas industry.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe your children should live there, I agree, no child should live there,\u201d New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said, taking a stance against fracking in favor of citizen welfare. Cuomo, along with legislators in Vermont, decided to ban fracking last December, despite the potential revenue it could generate for the state.\n\nMany speculate that the health impacts of fracking may be severe. In some studies it has been linked to interfering with hormone function, while others have found fracking contamination to cause gastrointestinal and sinus issues. With little knowledge as to whether or not air contamination results, there may be a whole slew of respiratory issues to be explored as well.\n\nEven though the EPA\u2019s finalized report has not been released, it is safe to say a definitive stance on health and safety issues will not be taken at this time. Hopefully, however, the report will illuminate the importance of enforcing fracking regulations to keep pollution out of our drinking water.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "water pollution, causes of water pollution, fracking", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The EPA acknowledges that fracking has caused contamination of water supplies in some instances, but these cases were small relative to all fracking wells.", "title": "Fracking Pollutes Water, But Not All The Time: EPA", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/epa-declares-fracking-has-polluted-water-supplies-not-frequently-336766", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/05/fracking.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The EPA acknowledges that fracking has caused contamination of water supplies in some instances, but these cases were small relative to all fracking wells.", "title": "Fracking Pollutes Water, But Not All The Time: EPA", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/epa-declares-fracking-has-polluted-water-supplies-not-frequently-336766", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/05/fracking.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/05/fracking.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-06-05T13:45:11-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-05T13:45:11-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The EPA acknowledges that fracking has caused contamination of water supplies in some instances, but these cases were small relative to all fracking wells."}, "article_summary": "The EPA acknowledges that fracking has caused contamination of water supplies in some instances, but these cases were small relative to all fracking wells.\nHopefully, however, the report will illuminate the importance of enforcing fracking regulations to keep pollution out of our drinking water.\nIn some studies it has been linked to interfering with hormone function, while others have found fracking contamination to cause gastrointestinal and sinus issues.\nHydraulic fracturing, when done to industry standards, does not impact drinking water,\u201d she said.\nIn early May, a study linked water contamination in Dimock PA with a nearby fracking well, one of many instances in the epicenter of the natural gas industry."}
