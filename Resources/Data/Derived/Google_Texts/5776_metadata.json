At the same time, the number of Americans identifying as religiously unaffiliated \u2013 including atheists and agnostics \u2013 has increased from 16.1 percent to 22.8 percent. The study attributes the changing religious landscape largely to millennials, who attend church far less than previous generations. But the trend is noticeable among older demographics as well. So what are to we make of these findings?\n\nThey should be seen, in part, as an inevitable result of the politicization of Christianity. Politics and religion have always made uneasy bedfellows, but there was a definitive shift in America\u2019s political and religious culture in the 1940s that set Christianity on its current course. As historian Kevin Kruse notes in a recent essay, it was during this period that Christian America was co-opted by corporate America. Following the Great Depression, Big Business had something of an image problem, and needed rebranding. Also problematic was FDR\u2019s New Deal, which was indispensable to the middle class but anathema to corporate interests.\n\nIndustrialists realized, Kruse writes, that, \u201cAs men of God, ministers could voice the same conservative complaints as business leaders, but without any suspicion that they were motivated by self-interest.\u201d Kruse goes on to explain how religious authorities were recruited by business leaders: \u201cIt was a watershed moment \u2013 the beginning of a movement that would advance over the 1940s and early 1950s a new blend of conservative religion, economics, and politics that one observer aptly anointed Christian libertarianism.\u201d Under the guise of this ideology, American clergy began to demonize the state: individualism was exalted; secularism was synonymous with socialism; and collectivism became the preferred boogeyman of businessmen and Christians. In short, capitalists purchased the pulpits of preachers, who equated economic freedom with spiritual salvation, God with limited government.\n\nThis alliance paved the way for the prosperity gospel, a preposterous doctrine according to which godliness and wealth are one and the same. Although the prosperity gospel emerged in the late 1940s as an independent Pentecostal movement, it aligned perfectly with the free market theology of Christian libertarianism.\n\nMuch like Christian libertarianism, the prosperity gospel is a swindle, a half-baked justification for hucksterism and greed. It\u2019s also an affront to Christ, who told his followers \u201cto sell what you have and give to the poor,\u201d to deny one\u2019s self and \u201ctake nothing for the journey.\u201d I\u2019m not a Christian, but these are clearly not the words of a libertarian or a capitalist. That anyone could wrest a doctrine of self-interest out of Christ\u2019s teaching is a miracle of misinterpretation. Christ was a prophet, not a profiteer. Prosperity theology is the gospel of those who want to feel good about serving themselves, who want to make a virtue of vice. And it\u2019s alive and well in America today, thanks, in part, to the corruption of Christianity by entrenched economic interests.\n\nThe politicization of Christianity was hastened in the 1970s and \u201980s, as conservative Protestants became politically active. The culture wars were reignited, and conservatives rallied to defend what they believed were traditional family values. The movement was explicitly religious, and fueled by fundamentalism. As evangelical scholar Lynn Buzzard observed, conservative Christians were told to \u201creject the division of human affairs into the secular and sacred and insist, instead, that there is no arena of human activity, including law and politics, which is outside of God\u2019s lordship.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nowadays, the Christian right is a fixture of the political world.
