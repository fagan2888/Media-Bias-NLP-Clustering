The previous high was 58 in a 66-8 win over the York Lions in 2009. The 66 points tied the team high also tied in the win over York in 2009 and originally recorded in a 66-14 win over the Toronto Varsity Blues in 2006.\n\n\"Every week we think we're the best team out there and if we're playing the way we can play, that's how we should be beating teams every day,\" Gryphon quarterback Jazz Lindsey said.\n\n\"Some people like to beat Western, I like to beat Queen's,\" Gryphon head coach Stu Lang said of downing his alma mater.\n\nFor the Gaels, the margin of defeat was their largest since 1971. Previous high was 60 points in 2000 when Queen's lost 67-7 to the Laurier Golden Hawks.\n\nOn this day in front of an announced crowd of 7,855, the Gryphs could do little wrong and the Gaels could do little right.\n\n\"It was good, but of course we had our little breakdowns here and there,\" Lindsey said. \"When we needed to put up some points and we needed to get our offence going, we were pretty good at that. We kept things going well.\"\n\n\"The good thing from a coaching standpoint is the team seems to be getting better and better each week,\" Lang said.\n\nThe Gryphs collected 679 yards of total offence and held Queen's to 264. The host gained 353 yards passing and 336 rushing and had another 204 on punt returns. They didn't have any kickoff return yards as the Gaels never kicked off.\n\nLindsey was at his best for the Gryphs as he completed 23 of 35 pass attempts for 345 yards and three touchdowns. He also ran six times for 46 yards and two touchdowns.\n\n\"Football is a quarterback driven sport and Jazz played arguably the best game he's ever done as a Gryphon,\" Lang said. \"That's exciting for us going forward.\"\n\nWhile Alex Charette (10 catches for 137 yards) and A'dre Fraser (8 for 127) accounted for most of the receptions, five other receivers hauled down passes.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you're just throwing to the open guy,\" Lindsey said. \"Things worked out and it was pretty well spread out, which is nice. It makes it a lot harder for everyone else when we're spreading the ball around.\"\n\nRunning back Rob Farquharson, who nursed a sore ankle last week and never participated in practice Thursday, churned ahead for 167 yards and a touchdown on 19 carries in three quarters. In the fourth quarter, he was on the Gryphon bench with ice on his left ankle. He'll be glad for the upcoming bye week.\n\n\"What a workhorse, it's unbelievable,\" Lang said.\n\nThe Gryphon defence recovered six fumbles by the Gaels and had 10 sacks including two each by defensive linemen Cam Walker, rookie Charlie Taggart and Djordge Gavrilovic who had his two on back-to-back plays.\n\n\"It was attrition,' Gavrilovic said of the sacks. \"I'd been getting there all game and didn't get a sack, but as a result of my teammates around me, I eventually got them.\"\n\nThe Gaels were held to 86 yards rushing on 26 carries.\n\n\"The key was to stop the run \u2013 stop the run and get in Billy's face,\" Gavrilovic said of hurrying Queen's quarterback Billy McPhee. \"We stopped the run early and they started throwing the ball and we got in the face of Billy. It was just a combination of everything. The secondary played extremely well and gave us time to get to the quarterback. The linebackers filled well on the run and we played well up front and it wasn't just one guy or two guys. It was everybody, the entire unit bringing everything together.\"\n\nThe Gryphs led 17-0 after the first quarter, 32-0 at halftime and 46-0 after the third quarter.\n\nLindsey scored touchdowns on 11- and one-yard runs and had touchdown tosses to Lucas Spagnuolo (27 yards), Fraser (40 yards) and Charette (23 yards).\n\nJohnny Augustine, who carried the ball nine times for 61 yards, scored a pair of touchdowns on 11-yard runs and Farquharson scored his touchdown on a six-yard run.\n\nAll the other points for the Gryphs were scored by the kicking Ferraro brothers. Daniel hit on a 40-yard field goal and kicked six converts and two rouges. Younger brother Gabe connected on a 12-yard field goal and kicked two converts and two rouges.\n\nWith the win, the Gryphs remain fourth in the league at 3-1. The McMaster Marauders lead at 4-0 while the Western Mustangs and Windsor Lancers are each at 3-0. The Carleton Ravens and Laurier Golden Hawks are each at 2-1 while the Ottawa Gee-Gees are at 2-2, the Toronto Varsity Blues are at 1-3 and the Gaels, Waterloo Warriors and York Lions are each at 0-4 and in danger of missing the playoffs.\n\nThe Gryphs are the team with the bye next weekend, then play the Windsor Lancers at Windsor Oct. 4. Next home game is Oct. 10 when the Gryphs are to host Carleton in a game on the Friday night of the Thanksgiving weekend.", "article_metadata": {"RATING": "GENERAL", "DESCRIPTION": "GUELPH \u2013 Don\u2019t know about the fans in the Alumni Stadium stands Saturday, but the Queen\u2019s Gaels certainly got hammered...", "COPYRIGHT": "\u00a9 Copyright 2016 Metroland Media Group Ltd.
