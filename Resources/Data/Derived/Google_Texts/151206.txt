COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — On the road into the capital from the main airport, dozens of the faithful have turned out in recent days to clean and decorate the Catholic churches that Pope Francis will pass on his Tuesday drive into Colombo.

“It is a privilege to see him with our own eyes,” said Sister Mary Cleophus, a nun and longtime teacher who was hanging decorative cloths of white and yellow — the papal colors — at Saints Peter and Paul Church.

Like many in the Indian Ocean island nation, she had feared last week’s elections, which pushed aside longtime President Mahinda Rajapaksa in a stunning upset. Politics has often meant violence in Sri Lanka, and Rajapaksa had rarely been subtle about amassing his immense power.

But when he was defeated by a former ally, Maithripala Sirisena, he quietly stepped down Friday morning. All went peacefully.

“It is a miracle,” said Cleophus. “We had doubts.”

Catholics make up less than 7 percent of Sri Lanka’s population.
