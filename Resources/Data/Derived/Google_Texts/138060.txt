Michigan transportation officials say a bus involved in a crash in Arkansas that killed six people had passed all recent safety inspections.

Michigan Department of Transportation spokesman Michael Frezell says the 1997 Van Hool bus involved in Friday's crash had passed all its annual inspections since 2009, as required under state law.

Frezell says the bus was last inspected in April and that transportation officials did not know what condition it was in when it was sold last month.

The company involved in a bus crash that killed six people on an Arkansas interstate had received approval from the federal government to bring foreign nationals to the U.S. to work in temporary agricultural jobs.

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services says it approved a petition from Juan Vasquez, doing business as Juan Vasquez Citrus, last year under its H-2A worker program. The program allows U.S. employers who meet specific regulatory requirements to bring in foreign nationals.

Employers must prove the jobs are seasonal and they don't have enough U.S. workers who are able, willing, qualified, and available to do the temporary work. H-2A visa holders can stay in no more than three years.

Authorities have not yet released the names or nationalities of those killed in Friday's crash but said the Mexican Consulate was helping to contact relatives.

The owner of a Michigan company whose name is emblazoned on a charter bus involved in a fatal crash in Arkansas says he'd recently sold a bus.

Jeff Lawson, who identified himself as the owner of Continental Charters in Detroit, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette newspaper that he sold the bus Saturday to a man who "said he needed a second bus to haul people from (Detroit) to Texas... and Florida."

The bus that crashed early Friday on Interstate 40 in Arkansas had "Continental" displayed on the side.

Lawson says that as part of the sale, he stipulated that the buyer remove the "Continental" lettering from the bus. He says Continental Charters did not have any scheduled routes in Arkansas on Thursday and does not regularly operate in the area.

Lawson says the bus he sold is a 1997 Van Hool that was most recently inspected by his company in February or March.
