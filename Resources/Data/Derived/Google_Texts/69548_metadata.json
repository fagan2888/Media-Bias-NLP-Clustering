That\u2019s almost twice the company\u2019s losses of $767 million in 2014, the first year of the informally-dubbed Obamacare\u2019s state exchanges for purchasing insurance.\n\nExpecting bigger losses in 2015 in relation to ACA products, HCSC earmarked close to $400 million in 2014, effectively raising reserves to $680.9 million. The company then spent almost all \u2013 $657.3 million \u2013 of those reserve funds to shoulder medical expenses in relation to ACA products in 2015.\n\n\u201c2015 was not a good year as far as the ACA went,\u201d said health insurance specialist Stephen Zaharuk, senior vice president at Moody\u2019s Investors Service. \u201cInsurers had no idea what to expect.\u201d\n\nIn what has been a big blow and arguably serious pain point for Obamacare, several large insurance firms, HCSC included, have reported significant losses on ACA plans. The overarching Affordable Care Act has allowed greater access to health insurance by expanding Medicaid and subsidizing insurance costs with tax credits. This has allowed more consumers to take advantage of insurance policies, but a lot of the growth has been empty, not earning much profit and suggesting unexpected medical expenses and regulatory pitfalls.\n\nThere may, however, be a light at the end of the tunnel for HCSC and other firms. According to HCSC divisional senior vice president Carl McDonald, the company did not earmark any reserves for potential ACA-related losses in 2016. This could hint at HCSC\u2019s business potentially breaking even this year. Still, the company has decided to play it cagey.\n\n\u201cOur not booking (reserve funds for ACA losses) for 2016 does not indicate nor imply an anticipated level of profitability for the year,\u201d wrote HCSC spokesman Gregory Thompson in an email to the Chicago Tribune.\n\nMeanwhile, stakes are also high for health insurance co-ops, which were battered by rough financial waters in 2015 resulting from ACA products. These co-ops have had a hard time attracting customers to the fold, and have also had to deal with expenses that went over forecasts. Experts such as HealthCare.gov CEO Kevin Counihan believe that 2016 will be a very important year for co-ops, as they will be forced to \u201cmove from startup to stability\u201d and become more financially solvent than they were in previous years.\n\nLaugh of the day:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Modern Readers", "description": "In its second year, the Obama administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act cost Blue Cross and Blue Shield\u00a0parent Health Care Service Corp (HCSC) and other insurers a\u00a0lot of money, giving critics more ammunition against President Barack Obama\u2019s so-called \u201cObamacare\u201d plans.
