But the increase expires on Thursday \u2014 just weeks after the Obama administration told the Supreme Court that doctors and other providers had no legal right to challenge the adequacy of payments they received from Medicaid.\n\nThe impact will vary by state, but a study by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research organization, estimates that doctors who have been receiving the enhanced payments will see their fees for primary care cut by 43 percent, on average.\n\nStephen Zuckerman, a health economist at the Urban Institute and co-author of the report, said Medicaid payments for primary care services could drop by 50 percent or more in California, Florida, New York and Pennsylvania, among other states.\n\nIn his budget request in March, President Obama proposed a one-year extension of the higher Medicaid payments. Several Democratic members of Congress backed the idea, but the proposals languished, and such legislation would appear to face long odds in the new Congress, with Republicans controlling both houses.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. David A. Fleming, the president of the American College of Physicians, which represents specialists in internal medicine, said some patients would have less access to care after the cuts. It would make no sense to reduce Medicaid payments \u201cat a time when the population enrolled in Medicaid is surging,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. George J. Petruncio, a family physician in Turnersville, N.J., described the cuts as a \u201cbait and switch\u201d move. \u201cThe government attempted to entice physicians into Medicaid with higher rates, then lowers reimbursement once the doctors are involved,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Nicole Brossoie, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Human Services, which runs the state\u2019s Medicaid program, said the increase was not meant to be permanent. \u201cThe enhanced rates will not be extended in New Jersey,\u201d Ms. Brossoie said. \u201cIt was always understood to be temporary.\u201d\n\nThe White House says Medicaid is contributing to the \u201clargest coverage gains in four decades,\u201d with 9.7 million people added to the Medicaid rolls since October 2013, bringing the total to 68.5 million. More than one-fifth of Americans are now covered by Medicaid.\n\nBut federal officials have not set forth a strategy to expand access to care with enrollment, and in many states Medicaid payment rates for primary care services, like routine office visits and the management of chronic illnesses, will plunge back to 2012 levels, widely seen as inadequate.\n\nFor the last two years, the federal government has required state Medicaid agencies to pay at least as much as Medicare pays for primary care services. Family doctors, internists and pediatricians have thus received Medicare-level payments for primary care, with the federal government making up the difference in costs.\n\nThe impending cuts are larger in states like California that have the widest gaps between Medicaid and Medicare rates.\n\nA survey by the Ohio State Medical Association found that some Ohio doctors began accepting Medicaid patients because of the rate increase in 2013. Ohio doctors who were already participating in the program said they had accepted more Medicaid patients after the rate increase. And almost 40 percent of Ohio doctors indicated that they planned to accept fewer Medicaid patients when the extra payments lapsed.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUnder federal law, Medicaid rates must be \u201csufficient to enlist enough providers\u201d so that beneficiaries have at least as much access to care as the general population in their geographic area. In practice, doctors say, this standard is murky.\n\nThe Obama administration told the Supreme Court last month that health care providers had no legal right to enforce the \u201cequal access\u201d requirement in court. This section of the Medicaid law provides guidance to federal and state officials in setting Medicaid rates, but does not allow health care providers to sue state officials to enforce it, said Donald B. Verrilli Jr., the solicitor general of the United States.\n\nThe case, Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, was filed against Richard Armstrong, director of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, by five providers of residential habilitation services to children with disabilities. They argued that Idaho\u2019s payment rates fell below federal standards, and they sued to enforce federal law, invoking the supremacy clause of the Constitution, which makes federal law \u201cthe supreme law of the land.\u201d\n\nThe court sidestepped the issue in a similar case from California in 2012. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said then, in a dissenting opinion, that \u201cnothing in the Medicaid Act allows providers or beneficiaries (or anyone else, for that matter) to sue to enforce\u201d the equal-access provision.\n\nMatt D. Salo, the executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, which represents state officials, said his group had not lobbied for an extension of the Medicaid fee increase. \u201cIt has rewarded providers who were already doing the right thing, but did not bring in a flood of new providers,\u201d Mr. Salo said.\n\nThe higher payments for primary care have been available in the traditional fee-for-service Medicaid program as well as in managed-care plans, which typically pay doctors a fixed amount per patient per month.\n\nJoseph A. Reblando, a spokesman for Medicaid Health Plans of America, a trade group, said, \u201cThe fee increase was a good idea in concept, but it was built on an antiquated system in which doctors were paid a separate fee for each service.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20141227091326, "twitter": {"description": "The Affordable Care Act provided a big increase in Medicaid payments
