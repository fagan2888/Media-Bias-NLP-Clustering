(Photo: karen roach, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nHospitals and medical practices share a growing problem with those they treat: Patients aren't paying their bills.\n\nWorking people are on the hook for an increasingly large portion of the cost of their care, as insurance policies pay for less. It's a trend that is not reversing \u2014 and it\u2019s causing financial distress for families and CEOs alike.\n\nIn health care, the billing process is called revenue cycle management. It\u2019s a complex system of diagnostic codes, services, insurance benefit analysis, billing departments and software.\n\nHospitals and providers, historically, received 90 percent of the reimbursement from insurers, according to The Advisory Board. The patient portion was more of an afterthought.\n\nThat dynamic is shifting as more people come under high deductible health plans. The ratio could settle around 70-30 \u2014 with patients paying nearly a third of their bills, said Ken Kubisty, senior vice president at Advisory Board Consulting and Management.\n\nFor every patient dollar being billed, hospitals have historically failed to collect 65 cents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take time for people to get their head around it, to understand they have to prepare for it.\u201d Larry Van Horn\n\nThe old process, in today\u2019s era of high deductibles and cost-sharing, is more aptly described as \"revenue cycle mismanagement\" \u2014 and it's impacting hospitals and medical groups around the country.\n\nWayne Smith, chairman and CEO of Franklin-based Community Health Systems, talked about the company\u2019s struggles with \u201cdoubtful accounts\u201d \u2014 or those unlikely to be paid \u2014 on a recent earnings call. A decline in collections, patient-paid co-pays and deductibles \u2014 as well as an increase in personal bankruptcies \u2014 led CHS to raise its doubtful account projection by $169 million.\n\nSmith talked about \"a decline in the growth for patient payments over time; and decreased collections from continuous self-pay growth\" in states that didn't expand Medicaid. A spokeswoman did not respond to requests for an interview.\n\nCHS is not alone, and the problem is not simple.\n\nBilling practices are not designed to collect small, incremental payments from hundreds or thousands of patients. They are designed to bill a handful of large entities \u2014 insurance companies \u2014 not individuals who walk in the door.\n\nOn top of that, patients aren\u2019t psychologically or financially prepared to pick up larger tabs. Nearly one in three Tennessee adults had outstanding medical debt in 2012.\n\nThere has to be a collective mindset shift, said Larry Van Horn, executive director of health affairs at Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate School of Management. Hospitals have to be more transparent in billing and pricing while patients have to be prepared to set money aside to pay for health care.\n\nWayne T. Smith, chairman and CEO, Community Health Systems (Photo: Submitted)\n\n\u201cPeople are not saving and people are going to need to plan for health care expenses just like they do for all kinds of services they already (pay for) out-of-pocket,\u201d said Van Horn.\n\nAn evolving marketplace\n\nThere are several reasons that bills go unpaid, including shifting payment responsibility, complicated billing and pricing practices.\n\nThe nature of insurance began changing well before the Affordable Care Act, bringing more people into high-deductible health plans \u2014 and upending the decades-old order of most reimbursement coming from insurance companies.\n\n\u201c(Providers) are lousy at doing business with patients because in reality they didn\u2019t have to in the past,\u201d said Kubisty.\n\nHigh deductibles are frequently the norm as employers restructure coverage to manage costs and more people shop on the federally-run exchange.\n\nNearly a quarter of the U.S. has a $2,000 deductible, said Van Horn.\n\nKen Kubisty (Photo: Submitted)\n\nThat\u2019s a staggering bill to pay before insurance coverage kicks in considering nearly two-thirds of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings, according to gobankingrates.com.\n\nA new group of underinsured people has emerged with the rise of high deductibles. They carry insurance cards in their wallet but struggle to meet the responsibility that comes with high deductibles.\n\nThe patient has not paid for, or even known, the true cost of care for decades. Consumption of service was divorced from payment unlike other services or goods.\n\nSurgeries, checkups and procedures are unlike any other service or product Americans purchase.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made choices and become accustomed to a level of consumerism, without setting aside money for health care,\u201d said Van Horn. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time for people to get their head around it, to understand they have to prepare for it.\"\n\nStruggling for a solution\n\nPatients are being thrust into the role of shoppers who buy necessary services that carry luxury price tags.\n\nVan Horn said \u201cthe move toward high-deductible health plans is unstoppable.\u201d He thinks that in 15 years that\u2019s all people will have.\n\nIt\u2019s a transition with hefty consequences for personal and corporate finances, as illustrated by Smith\u2019s recent comments.\n\nLarry Van Horn (Photo: Submitted)\n\nThe old system was designed to send past due accounts to collection agencies or write them off. But as patients are billed for more of the cost of their care, a new system balancing their responsibility with their ability to pay has yet to emerge.\n\nBut it should reflect the necessity of care as well as the necessity of payment.\n\nDavid Frederiksen, CEO of PatientFocus, is trying to make hospital billing more patient friendly. (Photo: Ashley Segroves)\n\n\u201cPatients have to adapt to a new reality. That\u2019s true. But so are providers. So are hospitals. They are chasing more dollars from patients,\u201d said David Frederiksen, CEO of PatientFocus. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be persistent and polite with patients.\"\n\nFrederiksen is trying to improve the way hospitals interact with patients once the bills start arriving. Nashville-based PatientFocus will explain a bill to patients and try to get them on a payment plan to keep them away from debt collectors.\n\n\u201cAs long as they are willing to send me something every month I will keep them out of bankruptcy, in terms of this,\u201d he said.\n\nThere will still be people who can\u2019t, or won\u2019t pay. Frederiksen said he expected the majority of people would opt for a payment plan but that\u2019s not been the case.\n\nAbout 10 percent of people choose a longtime payment option. About 30 percent choose to pay in full. The rest choose not to pay. They get thrown back to the hospital for a decision about whether to send the account to debt collection agency or write it off.\n\nObstacles ahead\n\nSolving the revenue cycle riddle will not be easy or cheap.\n\nStreamlining billing into a single itemized list is essential to helping turn patients into bill-paying customers.\n\nCommunity Health Systems has finalized a sale of two hospitals, agreed to sell another two and bought stakes in a portfolio of hospitals in Oklahoma. (Photo: Submitted)\n\nOne might not go back to a restaurant that gave you a bill for the appetizer then a bill for the bread then individual bills for the entr\u00e9e and drink.\n\nBut that\u2019s how health care is presently billed. An open heart surgery could bring individual bills from the cardiologist, the surgeon, the lab, the anesthesiologist, a consulting doctor who helped read charts and more.\n\n\u201cJust tell me what I owe. Quit nickel-and-diming me every 10 minutes,\u201d said Frederiksen. \u201cIt will wear you out.\"\n\nHospitals need to engineer user-friendly billing practices and processes, experts said.\n\nThe tools and models exist but they are not widely used, said Kubisty, who added his consultancy is seeing interest from hospitals on how to implement better billing processes.\n\nDuke University Health System \u2014 which fares better because officials strategize with patients about a payment plan before a procedure, according to Kubisty \u2014 reportedly spent about $700 million on a switch to Epic Systems\u2019 electronic health record software.\n\nThat\u2019s a journey that Vanderbilt University Medical Center started this fall.\n\nVUMC\u2019s chief informatics officer Dr. Kevin Johnson said the \u201ccoolest thing we\u2019re going to do with\" Epic \"is we\u2019re going to have our patients experience one bill.\u201d\n\nKevin Johnson, M.D. Biomedical Informatics Vanderbilt University Medical Center Photo: Anne Rayner;VUMC (Photo: Submitted)\n\nEasy-to-read billing and better financial counseling before a procedure will go a long way in bringing in more money, experts said.\n\nIt\u2019s a long-held perception in health care that a person with insurance had the income to pay the bills, said Kubisty. Insured patients are often not considered for charity care or the hospital\u2019s payment plans.\n\nBut one surgery or unexpected serious injury could destabilize a family\u2019s finances, even one that has insurance.\n\n\u201cYou have to be a good citizen. You can\u2019t beat up someone who can\u2019t participate,\u201d Kubisty said.\n\nReach Holly Fletcher at 615-259-8287 or on Twitter @hollyfletcher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1p1SIfG", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Hospitals and medical practices share a growing problem with those\u00a0they treat: Patients\u00a0aren't paying their bills.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Hospitals and medical practices share a growing problem with those\u00a0they treat: Patients\u00a0aren't paying their bills.", "title": "Why more than half of hospital bills don't get paid", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/money/industries/health-care/2016/03/07/why-more-than-half-hospital-bills-dont-get-paid/81297202/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hospitals and medical practices share a growing problem with those\u00a0they treat: Patients\u00a0aren't paying their bills.", "title": "Why more than half of hospital bills don't get paid", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a6f961a4642292d39e8d4193860fe333f6f82902/c=88-0-2424-2336&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/04/Nashville/Nashville/635926922818728942-ThinkstockPhotos-121277675.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/byhollyfletcher"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Companies/HCA Holdings", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Companies/HCA Holdings", "title": "Why more than half of hospital bills don't get paid", "author": "Holly Fletcher", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/industries/health-care", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2d1419d76abdd32e27dc91c968fb90151d9185b7/c=335-0-2087-2336/local/-/media/2016/03/04/Nashville/Nashville/635926922818728942-ThinkstockPhotos-121277675.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1aacbdbc94f970eb5426c496da685d1b7be69fed/c=88-0-2424-2336/local/-/media/2016/03/04/Nashville/Nashville/635926922818728942-ThinkstockPhotos-121277675.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e3e37e4f88d6721e7979211fb52d625d09b96924/c=199-0-3306-2336/local/-/media/2016/03/04/Nashville/Nashville/635926922818728942-ThinkstockPhotos-121277675.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ba1047637b0c5b6fa1c94010ffa5308079b7f32c/c=0-277-3499-2254&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2016/03/04/Nashville/Nashville/635926922818728942-ThinkstockPhotos-121277675.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-03-07T09:17:27.600000-06:00", "shorthed": "Why more than half of hospital bills don't get paid", "articleid": 81297202, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a41295d9977832b40df67b952aedc9c0bd7daf4f/c=0-277-3499-2254/local/-/media/2016/03/04/Nashville/Nashville/635926922818728942-ThinkstockPhotos-121277675.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/acf278a08c04d162551104ad1899bc838aae8416/c=665-0-1973-2336/local/-/media/2016/03/04/Nashville/Nashville/635926922818728942-ThinkstockPhotos-121277675.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "medical debt, community health systems, chs doubtful accounts, hca, revenue cycle management, larry van horn, patientfocus, advisory board, high deductibles, do i have to pay my hospital bill, why people don't pay hospital bills, medical bills, my doctor won't stop billing me,"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s a long-held perception in health care that a person with insurance had the income to pay the bills, said Kubisty.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made choices and become accustomed to a level of consumerism, without setting aside money for health care,\u201d said Van Horn.\nIn health care, the billing process is called revenue cycle management.\nBut that\u2019s how health care is presently billed.\nAn evolving marketplaceThere are several reasons that bills go unpaid, including shifting payment responsibility, complicated billing and pricing practices."}
