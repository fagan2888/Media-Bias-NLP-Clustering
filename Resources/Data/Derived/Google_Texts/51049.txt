With 6:57 remaining in Sunday’s game in Houston, Peyton Manning threw a touchdown pass to receiver Eric Decker, the quarterback’s 50th of 2013. (He threw one more on the afternoon, ending the day with 51, a new NFL record.) The pass, initially ruled a catch, was reviewed, and upon review, officials upheld the initial ruling.

Five days later, though, Texans interim head coach Wade Phillips says otherwise. Phillips told Houston media Friday that he asked the NFL for clarification on the catch after the fact, and the league told him that upon further review, Decker’s reception shouldn’t have been ruled a catch because he was juggling the ball.

“Poor Manning,” Phillips told Houston media. “He thought he broke the record.”

No matter what, the touchdown remains, and Manning still has the record, which he’s sure to add to on Sunday. Want to be the judge yourself? The Broncos have a video of the reception (or incomplete pass, depending on your perspective) on their website.
