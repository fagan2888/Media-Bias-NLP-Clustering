A former West Orange High School English teacher from Livingston, she says her priorities include improving the quality of life in Essex County, working with the open space trust fund, and working to create vocational schools in Essex County. \u201cI grew up in a family where I learned you do as much as you can for other people,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel the same way about being an elected official; I do as much as I can.\u201d Rufus Johnson \u2013 Johnson is a current Freeholder running for his third term on the board. The Newark resident said his priorities include public safety, park improvement, and infrastructure improvement. \u201cThe bottom line is results,\u201d he said of his political style. \u201cI don\u2019t need a soap box, I like to let my work speak for me.\u201d Lebby Jones \u2013 Jones, who spent 20 years as a councilwoman in Irvington, is running for Freeholder for the first time.

Brendan Gill \u2013 A current Freeholder in District 5, Gill is running for his first shot as an at-large Freeholder. Gill, of Montclair, who is also currently working as an advisor on the Cory Booker senate campaign, said he is most concerned about taxes and the county\u2019s fiscal health, improving residents\u2019 quality of life, protecting open space, and creating vocational schools in Essex County. \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor to serve the people of Essex County and I hope I can earn their trust and support again,\u201d he said.\n\nREPUBLICANS\n\nAdam Kraemer \u2013 Kraemer, a Columbia Teachers College graduate and West Orange resident who works at a international plastics manufacturer in Livingston, is running for his first term as Freeholder.

But, all nine Freeholders on the board are from the same party. There\u2019s not a diversity of ideas there,\u201d he said. Ryan Funsch \u2013 Funsch is a 23-year-old Montclair State graduate who works for the state of New Jersey, according to family members. He declined an interview for this article.

He said his main concerns are decreasing taxes and creating a magnet public high school in the county. \u201cMy number one issue is taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cEssex County has become unaffordable. I think the county spends too much money, and it spends it on foolish things.\u201d\n\nDISTRICT ONE\n\nThree candidates are running for one District One Freeholder seat. District One includes the North, East, and parts of Central and West Wards in Newark.\n\nDemocrat Rolando Bobadilla \u2013 First appointed to the seat in 2011 and elected to his first term later that year, Bobadilla is currently seeking his second term.
