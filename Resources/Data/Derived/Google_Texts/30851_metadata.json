But it goes back to that he\u2019s an old Missoula Central Spartan like myself.\n\n\u201cWhen he was let go at the University of Montana, he landed at Eastern Washington. He brought me there. He was recruiting me for (Montana) and he was the one responsible to get to me to Eastern. We remained friends. We had cabins up on Flathead Lake by each other and obviously he\u2019s the guy to set my path, my destiny more than anybody else.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t a very good player. He had a soft spot in his heart for an old Spartan. He meant a lot to a lot of people. The lives that he touched. \u2026 When I think about his funeral and all the people that were there, it was something. You see all the players that he touched, the people that he touched, the kind of guy he was. He\u2019d give you anything. He never asked for anything in return. Players who played for him loved him.\u201d\n\nAllen, a former star quarterback at Utah, had been defensive coordinator for the Portland Breakers when the United States Football League folded and stayed to become head coach at Portland State, then a struggling Division II program. The Vikings made the Division II national championship game twice under Allen and in 1992 drilled Boise State, then a I-AA power, 52-26 in Broncos Stadium, and Boise State hired him away for the next season.\n\nBy his second season, 1994, the Broncos made the I-AA national championship game. After Allen\u2019s death, the Broncos moved up to Division I in 1997 and Allen\u2019s successors included Houston Nutt, Dirk Koetter, Dan Hawkins, Chris Petersen and now Harsin.\n\nHarsin had been on the Boise staff when he joined Mack Brown\u2019s Texas staff in 2011, then spent 2013 as head coach at Arkansas State before returning to Boise State when Petersen took the job at Washington.\n\n\u201cA lot of people in college football don\u2019t really know where this guy was about to go,\u201d McElwain said. \u201cIt was cut way too short.\u201d\n\nHarsin this week said stepping away from Boise State for three seasons gave him \u201csomething different. And even stepping away from Boise State, (it was) hearing other people\u2019s opinions and perceptions of Boise State.\n\n\u201cPeople will tell you when you\u2019re no longer a part of it. But also, I think ultimately just a belief in our program and how we do things. It was something that was ingrained when I left and spent a few years away, you know what you want and I know what I believe and it\u2019s here at Boise. But seeing different things from different people, at different places, so I think I bring a little bit different perspective than I would have had I just stayed here. I think that helps our players and our coaches and ultimately hopefully it makes a better football team because of it.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, if they meet informally at midfield during early warmups, Harsin and McElwain can tell Pokey stories.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Boise State\u2019s Bryan Harsin, CSU\u2019s Jim McElwain played for beloved coach", "title": "Boise State\u2019s Bryan Harsin, CSU\u2019s Jim McElwain played for beloved coach", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/02/boise-states-bryan-harsin-csus-jim-mcelwain-played-for-beloved-coach/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140826__jim-mcelwain-csu-rams-082614bp1-4.jpg", "height": 479}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140826__jim-mcelwain-csu-rams-082614bp1-4.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-02T19:59:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:10:09+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda21d\"", "article_summary": "And even stepping away from Boise State, (it was) hearing other people\u2019s opinions and perceptions of Boise State.\nAs a player, Boise State coach Bryan Harsin was in the Broncos\u2019 program from 1995-99, and Colorado State\u2019s Jim McElwain \u2014 who like Allen was from Missoula, Mont.\n\u201cIt was cut way too short.\u201dHarsin this week said stepping away from Boise State for three seasons gave him \u201csomething different.\nHarsin had been on the Boise staff when he joined Mack Brown\u2019s Texas staff in 2011, then spent 2013 as head coach at Arkansas State before returning to Boise State when Petersen took the job at Washington.\nThe Vikings made the Division II national championship game twice under Allen and in 1992 drilled Boise State, then a I-AA power, 52-26 in Broncos Stadium, and Boise State hired him away for the next season."}
