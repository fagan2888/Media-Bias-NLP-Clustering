There is a reason I became a writer, and a deep love of math (or a talent with numbers, for that matter) wasn\u2019t one of them.\n\nFor example, somebody recently asked me if I knew how big the deficit was, and after thinking until my brain turned into a Gordian knot, I said, \u201cIn inches?\u201d\n\nBut I was curious. Just what exactly makes proportions pleasing? Is there a cheap trick?\n\nI reserved two seats for the \u201cDivine Proportions\u201d talk hoping that I would find someone nerdy enough to go with me, or at least elbow me to keep me from nodding off.\n\nStraight away, the first speaker put up a slide about some guy named Fibonacci. Who?\n\nHe was a math whiz born back in the 1200s who had nothing better to do than add sequential numbers together like this: 0 plus 1 is 1. 1 plus 1 is 2. 1 plus 2 is 3. 2 plus 3 is 5 and so on,\n\nThe sums of all these equations \u2014 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 \u2014 is known in certain esoteric circles in which I do not travel as the Fibonacci sequence. (At this point, I am scanning the room to see if anyone has put out appetizers. But I\u2019m stuck, and my friend actually appears interested, or is faking it well.)\n\nFibonacci apparently did this math either into infinity, or until he bored himself. Which came first, historians aren\u2019t quite sure.\n\nBut what they do know is, apparently, once you get rolling with the Fibonacci numbers, and get past eight, something magical happens. When you divide the smaller number into its larger neighbor, you get, more often than not, 1.618.\n\nI\u2019m not making this up: 34 into 55 is 1.618. Keep going, 144 into 233 is 1.618.\n\nSome call this the Divine Proportion, or the Golden Mean. I call it flippin\u2019 freaky.\n\nSo what does this have to do with home design? (By now, my eyebrows are working so hard to find each other they have crocheted a little blanket.)\n\nHere\u2019s what: Someone figured out that the relationship between those numbers not only made beautiful math, but also beautiful art and architecture.\n\nThat ratio of one to, let\u2019s call it 1.6, just to tick them off, is repeated over and over in art, design, architecture and \u2014 get ready for this \u2014 nature, because apparently God was in on all this, too.\n\nThe relationship between the smaller and the larger forms creates what is universally believed to be the most pleasing proportions. The ratio is evident in Stonehenge, the Egyptian Pyramids and the Parthenon. Leonardo DaVinci and Michelangelo read Fibonacci, and must have thought he was onto something, because the golden ratio was a staple in their art.\n\nIn nature, we see the proportionally progressive spiral in a nautilus shell, a hurricane and a galaxy. It shows up in the seed pattern in the center of a sunflower, the pattern on a pine cone, the curl of an ocean wave and the unfurling tip of a fern. It shows up so often it defies coincidence.\n\nOK, so I was wowed. But that stopped when the experts began speculating whether our preference for these pleasing proportions is learned or innate. Do we like them because we\u2019ve seen them around since the beginning of time, or because we were born liking them, given our creator?\n\nThe discussion had now gotten to a level of theological navel-gazing best reserved for those who really care whether the chicken or egg came first. I was out of there.\n\nBut I left caring about how to apply this math magic at home. Here\u2019s how:\n\n1. Divide by three.\n\nWhen comparing two items that are perfectly proportioned, according to these rules, the larger one will be almost two thirds larger than the smaller one. So an ideally proportioned table would be about two thirds longer than it is wide, or 45 by 72 inches.\n\n2. The 60-30-10 rule.\n\nSome interior designers have taken the Golden Mean and interpreted it informally into the 60-30-10 rule of design. Applied to color, it works well: 60 percent of your room should be one background color \u2014 say, pale aqua; 30 percent should be a contrast color \u2014 call it dark pewter; and 10 percent an accent color \u2014 let\u2019s say tangerine. (A tiny splash of turquoise would also be a nice touch.)\n\n3. Five stars.\n\nThe Golden Mean is evident in a pentagon, which, of course, is the star, the starfish, and the pattern seen in the lateral cut of an apple, and in the figure of the Vitruvian Man, where a five-pointed body with a head plus two arm and two legs fits in a circle. The five-pointed shape factors heavily \u2014 and pleasantly \u2014 into design.\n\n4. Be odd.\n\nThe best designs aren\u2019t static. They show progression. This is partly why three or five flowers in a vase look better than two or four. The odd number creates a hierarchy.\n\n5. Apply spiral math.\n\nAccessories on a mantle or coffee table should spiral down in a progression to an arc of interesting objects to look at.\n\nAnd that is all the math for me \u2014 for at least 1.618 decades.\n\nSyndicated columnist and speaker Marni Jameson is the author of \u201cHouse of Havoc\u201d and \u201cThe House Always Wins\u201d (Ad Capo Press).
