She has Crohn\u2019s disease and uses a wheelchair to get around because walking exhausts her.\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t want to be in the nursing home where she has lived since May.\n\nGiron, 65, is looking to rent a small house in the industrial town in the Cleveland suburbs where she grew up. Using federal funds from a special project, thousands of elderly and disabled nursing home residents have been able to move into their own homes in recent years. The experimental project has reached people in 44 states, including more than 5,400 in Ohio. It connects people to the medical and living support they need to move into private homes, so that they can live independently.\n\nBut often the housing is the sticking point. Giron doesn\u2019t have family members who could take her in, so she\u2019s house-hunting. As she tours one likely prospect, she manages to get out of her wheelchair to maneuver down some stairs; at the bottom, Giron looks out a window at the front porch and says she can picture herself sitting outside watching the neighborhood.\n\nThen, she sees the kitchen.\n\n\u201cOh, we even got a dishwasher! Oh, my goodness gracious. Yeah, I want this one. I want this one,\u201d she says, laughing.\n\nDespite her health problems, Giron feels out of place in the nursing home, where many residents are older and sicker than she is.\n\nDespite her health problems, Giron feels out of place in the nursing home, where many residents are older and sicker than she is.\u201cI\u2019m a very independent woman,\u201d she says. \u201cI have been for most of my life. I mean, I\u2019ve had to be.\u201d\n\nBut independence is difficult to achieve. And until recently her health insurance \u2013 Medicaid \u2014 has been the roadblock. Ohio Medicaid director John McCarthy explains that the federal program that offers health coverage for the poor and disabled is primarily set up to help people live in nursing homes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the housing that\u2019s the hard part, because Medicaid will not pay for housing costs, meaning room and board,\u201d McCarthy says. \u201cIt will only pay for room and board in institutions.\u201d\n\nIf Giron finds a home, she will have to pay rent out of her small pension. But as part of this experimental program, Medicaid will pay for the costs of setting up house: house-hunting, deposits for rent, and the purchasing of household items like furniture. Perhaps most importantly, it provides a transition coordinator to help find the home and connect Giron to services she\u2019ll need, such as home health workers.\n\n\u201cIt is a lot of work,\u201d McCarthy says. \u201cThese are not easy cases to deal with. It\u2019s not like you just find somebody and move them. It takes a lot of time and effort to make this happen.\u201d\n\nMany in the program are older and disabled like Giron. But most in Ohio are actually younger than 65, often with physical or mental challenges that make finding the right housing particularly difficult.\n\nIn every category, though, making it possible for these Medicaid recipients to live on their own saves the state and federal government money. McCarthy and his team estimate that the average costs for an individual in the experimental program (which is called Money Follows the Person) is $49,000. Under traditional Medicaid it costs about $64,000 annually for nursing home care in Ohio.\n\nThe state\u2019s Republican administration believes so strongly in this project that it stepped up efforts to transition people into it three years ago, right after the project was funded again, under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nOhio, Texas and Washington account for 40 percent of the nation\u2019s home placements since the federal project began.\n\nThe program is very popular with beneficiaries, policy makers and even some nursing homes, but there are still two big challenges. For one, funding for the program was extended under the Affordable Care Act in 2010 but is set to expire in September 2016.\n\nAnd, secondly, people like Giron who are waiting to get a home are finding it very difficult to find one that\u2019s affordable.\n\n\u201cI just want my own place,\u201d Giron says. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything fancy. I just want something to call my own. I just want to be in my own home. I just want to live my life normally like most people do. I want to be on my own. I want to be happy.\u201d She starts to cry.\n\nGiron did not end up getting the little, two-story house with the dishwasher. But she did get some good news for the holidays: In late December, she signed a lease for a different place and is slated to move into the home in January.\n\nThis story is part of a reporting partnership with Ideastream, NPR and Kaiser Health News.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The average costs for an individual in the experimental program (which is called Money Follows the Person) is $49,000.
