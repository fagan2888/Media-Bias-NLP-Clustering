Contributing to the growth were increases of 13 percent in UPMC Health Plan membership, 3 percent in physician revenue and 1 percent in outpatient revenue, while hospital stays dropped by 1 percent, according to financial statements.\n\nThe system reported $5.1 billion in cash and investments, and total operating revenues for the period of $9.5 billion.\n\nThe results followed the recent announcement that UPMC has entered merger talks with Susquehanna Health, a four-hospital health system with a $562 million operating budget in north central Pennsylvania.\n\nHospital officials reported revenue increases from mergers ranging from 4 percent at UPMC Altoona \u2014 with which UPMC merged in 2013 \u2014 to 47 percent at UPMC Mercy since a 2008 merger.\n\nPatient volumes have increased following the mergers, said Leslie Davis, the system's chief operating officer.\n\n\u201cConsumers recognize our brand, and when we're willing to move it to the community, we're either creating demand that didn't exist before or people are probably coming from other places,\u201d Davis said.\n\nBranding plays a role, she said. The system attached the Magee-Womens brand to a new women's hospital at UPMC Hamot in Erie and increased services, driving up revenues, she said.\n\nAdding hospitals to the system also helps increase UPMC Health Plan membership, said Robert DeMichiei, UPMC's chief financial officer.\n\nThe health plan has attracted members through the federal Affordable Care Act's marketplace and in Medicaid managed care plans, DeMichiei said.\n\nUPMC has not reported specific financial results for its ACA plans, a line of business that is losing money for many insurers \u2014 including Highmark Inc. \u2014 but not all.\n\nUPMC plans to continue to sell health insurance in the areas where it merges with new hospitals, he said.\n\nWes Venteicher is a Tribune-Review staff writer.
