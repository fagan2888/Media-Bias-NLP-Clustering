Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP, says tech firms are starting to dominate the Brandz Top 10 most valuable brands, not just the Chinese banks.

The flurry of deals by Chinese companies made in recent weeks could be the start of a broader push by firms in the mainland to fast track their entry overseas, said Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising giant WPP.

Sorrell's comments come close on the heels of a slew of high-profile moves by Chinese companies to snag assets abroad, including Chinese insurer Anbang, which is set to acquire hotel operator Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide for about $13.2 billion, the firm's biggest push yet into the global real estate market.

"(We are now seeing) quite strong entrepreneurially-driven, individually-driven companies which are being very aggressive on the world stage as state-owned enterprises come under the microscope, maybe not moving as quickly as the government wants them to," Sorrell told CNBC's Squawk Box on Monday.
