This is a must-watch for its wider implications. The question is stark: Who is going to do the shoving and who gets pushed?\n\nOn one side stand private-sector bondholders, who have been talking a very tough game. No, they won\u2019t take the kind of haircut\u2014a write-down of principal and interest\u2014that they accepted in the Greek case three years ago. In the trade this is called \u201cGreek fatigue,\u201d as in enough\u2019s enough.\n\nRelated: Ukraine Creditor Group Repeats Objection To 'Haircut'\n\nOn the other side stand the Kiev government and its international backers. Among these the International Monetary Fund is paramount, but the U.S. Treasury and the European Union are also on the scene.\n\nNatalie Jaresko, the Ukrainian finance minister, makes the argument plainly and often. \u201cI don\u2019t see a meltdown per se,\u201d she said at a gathering in Kiev earlier this month, \u201cbut the question is whether we can continue to service our debt.\u201d As if in response, the parliament in Kiev voted last week to give Jaresko the power to suspend debt payments to \u201cunscrupulous\u201d international lenders.\n\nI don\u2019t know the difference between a meltdown and a meltdown per se, but Jaresko\u2019s \u201cper se\u201d seems in danger of disappearing. Near term, a meltdown would mean a moratorium on debt payments, which is what we say in polite company when we want to avoid the term \u201cdefault.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d say this game\u2019s just about over. It\u2019s the bottom of the ninth and Kiev is at bat. It either scores a deal with its creditors or the home team turns in a losing season.\n\nRelated: Summers Says Ukraine Shouldn\u2019t Pay 'Selfish' Bondholders\n\nMy call: Jaresko will get enough of what she wants to keep Ukraine staggering along. Two reasons.\n\nOne, reports last week indicate a thaw in her contacts with investors, who recently formed groups to advance their positions, which vary. Two, the geopolitics animating the Ukraine case are simply too powerful: Propping up Kiev involves way more than a bunch of bank transfers that bring smiles to bondholders\u2019 faces.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to distinguish the black hats from the white in all this for the simple reason nobody wears either this time. Settling Ukraine\u2019s debt is a sordid contest of wills, and whichever side wins doesn\u2019t deserve to, for my money.\n\nThat zinger requires explanation, so here goes:\n\nInternational bondholders make the same argument advanced in the Greek case: We extended credit, the terms are agreed, and we expect them to be observed. Not only do we want our money back; there\u2019s also the question of maintaining order in international lending markets.\n\nCreditors nurse another gripe, and it\u2019s not to be missed.\n\nRelated: Russia Says Ukraine Debt Repayment Law Amounts to Default\n\nUntil the global financial and economic crises of the past seven years, the I.M.F. did things pretty simply. It extended a bailout with severe conditions attached and the banks got paid. As a European friend put it not long ago, it was too embarrassing for the fund to write checks directly to lenders, so it wrote them to the debtor nation, which then wrote the checks to creditors.\n\nBut amid multiple crises the fund has taken to requiring lenders to take at least modest hits themselves. These are the frequently cited bail-ins, or haircuts. \u201cWe\u2019ll come in on this,\u201d the I.M.F. effectively tells the banks, \u201cbut for less than net present value. You suck up the rest.\u201d\n\nThis is new and not popular, to put the point mildly. Lenders took a 50 percent-plus haircut in Greece\u2019s 2012 restructuring, but the Greeks\u2014as is now evident\u2014may\u2019ve won the battle and lost the war.\n\nIn April creditors accepted a three-month moratorium on a debt payment due from a state-owned Ukrainian bank. But that, they have since stressed, involved no adjustment in terms.\n\nA final point to be noted: In a television interview Friday, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev indicated that Moscow saw no reason to alter any of the terms on the Ukrainian debt it holds. It\u2019s a hard line, but I\u2019m not sure anyone could expect otherwise in the context.\n\nRelated: Sanctions-Hit Russian Economy Shrinks In First Quarter\n\nUkraine argues that it has instituted one of the most extensive reform programs in the I.M.F.\u2019s annals. It is cutting wastage, bureaucratic red tape, impediments to foreign investment, corruption, labor protections, and subsidies.\n\nKiev insists it can meet the I.M.F.\u2019s core condition\u2014$15.3 billion in savings\u2014to shake loose further tranches of the $40 billion bailout the fund supports and partly finances. \u201cThe case for debt reduction is as strong as any that I have encountered over the past quarter century,\u201d Lawrence Summers wrote in a much-noted Financial Times comment earlier this month.\n\nThat\u2019s the explicit argument. The implicit argument is that the geopolitics surrounding Ukraine\u2019s future can\u2019t be ignored. Summers, indeed, brought this point to the surface in his FT item.\n\nLast Friday Jaresko signaled that direct talks in London with lender groups, which have so far looked pointless, will soon begin in earnest. \u201cThere is noticeable progress,\u201d she said in a telephone exchange with Reuters. \u201cAdvisers are in contact every day. We expect that the next step will be a meeting with the creditors.\u201d\n\nA few creditor groups have already signaled that they\u2019ll accept marginal write-downs, opening the door to protracted horse-trading. My call: At bottom this is a political crisis, and in the end the politics will rule in Kiev\u2019s favor.\n\nIt\u2019ll be no cause for hallelujahs either way.\n\nRelated: Putin Isn\u2019t Reviving the USSR, He\u2019s Creating a Fascist State\n\nCreditors look selfish and spoiled. They lent the money -- every profligate borrower requires a profligate lender. The word missing from their vocabulary is \u201crisk.\u201d Equally, the I.M.F. doesn\u2019t\u2014or shouldn\u2019t\u2014operate as a bank-rescue mechanism. It is supposed to rescue nations.\n\nAs to Kiev, a good deal of its argument is simply false. The Poroshenko government is proving at least as corrupt as the regime it replaced; Prime Minister Arsenyi Yatsenyuk is now under investigation on suspicion of misappropriating $325 million in public funds.\n\nThere are serious political liabilities, too. Yatsenyuk\u2019s reform package is ambitious, yes, but it has rendered him deeply unpopular, if not despised, my sources in Kiev report; political instability in the capital is already evident.\n\nFinally, Kiev has been very uncooperative in advancing the terms of the settlement agreement known as Mink II. Europeans now view it as the main impediment to a negotiated solution, my sources tell me.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Push is quickly coming to shove over Ukraine\u2019s $35 billion in government debt, $23 bil", "title": "Why Ukraine Will Get Its Debt Restructured", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/05/26/Why-Ukraine-Will-Get-Its-Debt-Restructured", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10172012_World_Currency_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/05/26/Why-Ukraine-Will-Get-Its-Debt-Restructured", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10172012_World_Currency_article.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Push is quickly coming to shove over Ukraine\u2019s $35 billion in government debt, $23 bil", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfab9\"", "article_summary": "Related: Russia Says Ukraine Debt Repayment Law Amounts to DefaultUntil the global financial and economic crises of the past seven years, the I.M.F.\nPush is quickly coming to shove over Ukraine\u2019s $35 billion in government debt, $23 billion of which must be either paid or restructured in June.\nRelated: Summers Says Ukraine Shouldn\u2019t Pay 'Selfish' BondholdersMy call: Jaresko will get enough of what she wants to keep Ukraine staggering along.\nRelated: Ukraine Creditor Group Repeats Objection To 'Haircut'On the other side stand the Kiev government and its international backers.\nTwo, the geopolitics animating the Ukraine case are simply too powerful: Propping up Kiev involves way more than a bunch of bank transfers that bring smiles to bondholders\u2019 faces."}
