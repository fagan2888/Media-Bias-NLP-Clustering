The footnotes have been removed from the online version.)\n\nWhat exactly do we mean by the phrase \"conspiracy theory\"? The problem is vexing enough in the academic literature, where scholars have made countless attempts to formulate a firm definition, none of which has managed to push its rival definitions off the stage. In everyday usage, the term is even more slippery: Its meaning constantly stretches and narrows, particularly when it is used as a pejorative. What follows is more impressionistic than systematic\u2014not a complete study of the way the words \"conspiracy theory\" are used, but some observations about the way it bends to include or not include certain stories, and a hypothesis about why that might be so.\n\nLet's begin with the great vaccine debate of February 2015. That month New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, and White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest all suggested, to one degree or another, that when it comes to childhood vaccines, public health should be balanced with parental choice. Christie, who we'll focus on here, called vaccinations \"an important part of being sure we protect\" children's health, but added that \"parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well.\"\n\nChristie's opponents immediately started digging for anything else he might have said on the subject. They found he had a history of courting voters who believe there might be a causal link between vaccines and autism. In 2009, for example, he put his signature on a letter that said:\n\nI have met with families affected by autism from across the state and have been struck by their incredible grace and courage. Many of these families have expressed their concern over New Jersey's highest-in-the nation vaccine mandates. I stand with them now, and will stand with them as their governor in their fight for greater parental involvement in vaccination decisions that affect their children.\n\nOne prominent liberal site, ThinkProgress, reported this news under the headline \"Chris Christie's Long Flirtation With Anti-Vaccine Conspiracy Theories.\" Another, The Daily Kos, used the title \"In 2009, Chris Christie sent letter endorsing anti-vaxxer conspiracy theory.\" Watching discussions of the story on social media, I repeatedly saw the phrase \"conspiracy theory\" attached to Christie's claims. Yet none of Christie's comments invoked a conspiracy.\n\nPerhaps the slippage is understandable in this case. After all, many people who believe these discredited claims about vaccines also believe that there is a conspiracy to conceal the shots' supposed ill effects. But the idea of a vaccine/autism connection is not innately conspiratorial, and the attempts I've seen to argue otherwise fall flat. An article in Salon, for instance, claimed that anti-vaxxers \"are, at their core, conspiracy theorists\" because they must \"believe that all major health organizations in the world are colluding to cover up the supposed dangers of vaccines.\" But of course there's no reason to assume a vaccine skeptic is actually aware of how strong the scientific consensus on the question is. Indeed, when powerful figures like Christie\u2014and, the year before Christie wrote that letter, Barack Obama, John McCain, and Hillary Clinton\u2014throw around phrases like \"the science right now is inconclusive,\" that creates the illusion not of a conspiracy but of an open question.\n\nA year before the vaccine debate flared up, the phrase \"conspiracy theory\" was invoked in an even odder context. At one moment during CNN's heavy coverage of the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, host Don Lemon mentioned that some people had suggested the plane had been swallowed by a black hole, an idea he categorized with \"all of these conspiracy theories.\"\n\nAs with the supposed vaccination/autism link, there have been conspiracy theories about the missing airplane. But this surely was not one of them, since a black hole is not a secret plot. Yet Lemon wasn't the only person to make that category error. A video at The Daily Beast, for example, claimed to list the \"kookiest conspiracy theories\" about the plane. It did indeed list a lot of conspiracy theories, but it also included the black hole, along with the idea that the plane had been hit by a meteor\u2014no, not a meteor controlled by a conspiracy\u2014and the notion that it had landed on an isolated island.\n\nAnother recent example: In 2014 Technology Review published an article headlined \"Data Mining Reveals How Conspiracy Theories Emerge on Facebook.\" This article covered an interesting piece of research from Italy, where a quintet of scholars were observing how a large sample of Facebook users engaged with different sorts of stories. One of the tales the team looked at was a satiric piece claiming the country had passed a bill giving legislators 134 billion Euros \"to find a job in case of defeat.\" Many readers had mistaken this spoof for an actual news report, and thousands of people signed a petition against the imaginary law. The Technology Review article led with this tale, which it used to argue that \"Conspiracy theories seem to come about by a process in which ordinary satirical commentary or obviously false content somehow jumps the credulity barrier.\"\n\nYet again, we see the term being applied in a strange way. The rumor involved a bill supposedly passed in public by the Italian senate, not a secret plan hatched by an hidden cabal. Nor did the original group of scholars claim it was a conspiracy theory. Their concern was with the transmission of false stories, whether or not they involved secret plotting. (The word \"conspiracy\" and its variants appear only four times in their study.) But for the Technology Review writer, \"false story\" and \"conspiracy theory\" apparently were synonyms.\n\n* * *\n\nSo on the one hand there is this habit of using the phrase \"conspiracy theory\" to describe dubious claims that do not actually include conspiracies. Couple that now with another trend: the tendency not to use the phrase \"conspiracy theory\" to describe conspiracy stories embraced by the mainstream.\n\nWhen I say \"embraced by the mainstream,\" I'm not referring to beliefs that are widely held but still somewhat disreputable, like some of the JFK assassination theories. Nor do I mean those events, such as Watergate or Iran-contra, where a conspiracy clearly took place. I mean things like these:\n\n\u2022 Terrorism. Real terrorist conspiracies obviously do exist, but recent history is also filled with purported plots that failed to materialize. Furthermore, when terror plots do occur, people often assume they're part of a larger organized effort even when the evidence for such centralization is scarce. (In the wake of 9/11, for example, the White House reportedly pushed the FBI to prove that Al Qaeda was responsible for the anthrax mailings.) And where there really is a larger organized effort, there is a tendency to imagine it in ways that have more in common with paranoid pulp fiction than with asymmetric warfare as it's conducted in the real world.\n\nConsider this November 2001 report in The Independent, which purported to describe Osama bin Laden's Tor Bora base:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The assumptions baked into a familiar phrase", "title": "What We Mean When We Say 'Conspiracy Theory'", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/03/15/what-we-mean-when-we-say-conspiracy-theo", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14260132256886.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The assumptions baked into a familiar phrase", "title": "What We Mean When We Say 'Conspiracy Theory'", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14260132256886.jpg", "creator": "@notjessewalker", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-03-15T14:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/jesse-walker"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Couple that now with another trend: the tendency not to use the phrase \"conspiracy theory\" to describe conspiracy stories embraced by the mainstream.\nWhat exactly do we mean by the phrase \"conspiracy theory\"?\nWatching discussions of the story on social media, I repeatedly saw the phrase \"conspiracy theory\" attached to Christie's claims.\n(This paper was presented at the Conspiracy Theory Conference at the University of Miami on March 13, 2015.\n* * *So on the one hand there is this habit of using the phrase \"conspiracy theory\" to describe dubious claims that do not actually include conspiracies."}
