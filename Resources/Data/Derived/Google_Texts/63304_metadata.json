But the rhetoric and uncertainty of the electioneering means increased short-term market volatility, according to Fidelity International.\n\nThat said, these aren\u2019t hard and fast rules, and history does not always repeat itself.\n\nThis year is unique in many ways; there is no presidential incumbent running for re-election and the current vice president is not a candidate, so whoever wins will be new to the office.\n\nIndustries affected by the election\n\nAt this early stage, it is difficult to assess which sectors and companies are going to benefit from each candidate\u2019s policies.\n\nIt is likely that there will be further clarity when the real campaign starts with drug pricing, US defence spending, and financial services regulatory reform set to be the topics most in the spotlight.\n\n\"On the whole, the short-term volatility in the run-up to the election can create buying opportunities.\"\n\nAt a broader level, there is also speculation around how each candidate\u2019s policies will impact the pace of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve.\n\nDrug pricing\n\nPharmaceutical and biotech stocks have suffered from downwards pricing pressure following comments from Clinton last autumn and this may continue to weigh on performance. But at the same time it may also provide some interesting entry points.\n\nIt is perhaps worth remembering that the Republicans control the senate and are likely to be lukewarm, at best, towards new legislation on reducing drug prices.\n\nThis reluctance to support healthcare reforms was demonstrated in their opposition to \u2018Obamacare\u2019, ultimately resulting in a much watered down version of the original proposals.\n\nAs for Trump, like many of his policies, the messages on healthcare are somewhat inconsistent.\n\nHe has spoken about the need for drug price negotiation on the campaign trail, but this has not subsequently featured in his \u2018Seven Point Plan\u2019.\n\nHe remains a Republican deep down and this means that significant reforms in healthcare appear unlikely. Perhaps the most likely outcome from this bad publicity during the campaign is that the healthcare industry self regulates drug prices more sensibly.\n\nUS military spend\n\nDefence budgets are also likely to be as subject of debate, but meaningful cuts are perhaps unlikely in the context of ongoing global security concerns. For instance, the US has already set out plans to quadruple the budget for European defence in 2017 in the light of \u2018Russian aggression\u2019.\n\nInstead of calling for yet another round of defence budget cuts, both front-runners seem to be more focused on proposing better transparency and efficiency within the US military.\n\nFinancial services regulatory reform\n\nIt is more than seven years since the height of the financial crisis, but banks have struggled to restore their reputation in the eyes of the US public. This has made them a popular \u2018pantomime villain\u2019 for the campaign trail.\n\nMost candidates have proposed stricter regulations and Democrat Bernie Sanders has even called for a bill to recreate the \u2018Glass Steagall Act\u2019, which separates investment banking from retail banking.\n\nSuch extreme reforms are perhaps unlikely given the regulations already brought in under the Obama tenure, especially when taking into account the improved health of US banks balance sheets.\n\nMinimum wage\n\nOn the flip side, there has been increased noise about the raising of the minimum wage during the campaign trail.\n\nIn the US, the Federal minimum wage has not increased since 2009 and a rise may lead to acceleration in wage growth, which could force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at a faster rate.\n\nHistorically, interest rate rises have supported earnings growth for banks and insurance companies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the final battle for the White House inevitably looking like a showdown between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, the relationship between presidential elections and the US stock market is once again catching the attention of investors.", "csrf-token": "MDepRo9avi/rRqyZ0GsC1Ood7C1oRHyuV+u0QWij4ms=", "robots": "index, follow", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "www.international-adviser.com", "description": "With the final battle for the White House inevitably looking like a showdown between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, the relationship between presidential elections...", "title": "Clinton vs Trump and the US stock market fallout", "url": "http://www.international-adviser.com/news/1028977/clinton-vs-trump-us-stock-market-fallout", "image": "http://www.international-adviser.com/w-images/000c3ecf-5ce5-4bbd-b227-628a4a52aedc/2/boxinggloves-350x250.jpg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "North America ,Hillary Clinton,Donald Trump,White House,Election,United States", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=2.0,minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "This reluctance to support healthcare reforms was demonstrated in their opposition to \u2018Obamacare\u2019, ultimately resulting in a much watered down version of the original proposals.\nBut the rhetoric and uncertainty of the electioneering means increased short-term market volatility, according to Fidelity International.\nMinimum wageOn the flip side, there has been increased noise about the raising of the minimum wage during the campaign trail.\nHe remains a Republican deep down and this means that significant reforms in healthcare appear unlikely.\nHistorically, the US market has tended to fall in the final year of a president\u2019s second term."}
