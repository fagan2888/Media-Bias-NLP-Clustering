Each pronouncement from the Sultan of Slur is treated as epic, no matter how deeply insulting, bigoted or just plain ridiculous.\n\nYou may have seen by now that recent Tyndall Report analysis of the nightly news shows on ABC, CBS, and NBC. It found that from January 1 through November, the big three had devoted 234 minutes of reporting to Donald Trump but only ten to Bernie Sanders. At ABC,World News Tonight had given the Trump campaign 81 minutes of coverage while Bernie Sanders has received less than a minute. A minute!\n\nOur friend and colleague John Nichols at The Nation magazine says that it\u2019s useless to try to get the networks to dial it back; every Trump bellow leaves them begging for more. Rather, he writes, \u201cWhen a candidate is playing to the worst fears of Americans, what\u2019s needed is more serious and intensive coverage that puts things in perspective\u2026 The point is to recognize that there are other candidates who are getting as much support as Trump, that are exciting crowds and gaining significant support, and that are advancing dramatically different responses to the challenges facing America. That\u2019s not happening now.\u201d\n\nBig surprise, the problem is money. Tons of it. Trump brings ratings and ratings raise advertising revenue. What\u2019s more, in an insane election cycle like this one, cash already is pouring in from the production, sale and placement of political TV advertising, cash that also makes television executives and political strategists wealthy. Here\u2019s CBS chief executive Les Moonves at an investor presentation last week, cheering on Trump and the other Republican candidates: \u201cThe more they spend, the better it is for us\u2026 Go Donald! Keep getting out there. And you know, this is fun, watching this, let them spend money on us\u2026 We\u2019re looking forward to a very exciting political year in \u201916.\u201d\n\nThis is the same Les Moonves who declared during the 2012 campaign, \u201cSuper PACs may be bad for America, but they\u2019re very good for CBS.\u201d And earlier this year, on an investors call, he said, \u201cLooking ahead, the 2016 presidential election is right around the corner and, thank God, the rancor has already begun.\u201d You can hear the fictional Howard Beale of Paddy Chayefsky\u2019s Network spinning in his fictional grave, still mad as hell.\n\nMoonves likes to play the wise guy but he also knows that some are predicting that the 2016 presidential election may cost as much as $5 billion, with much if not most of it going to television. Hard to believe that, as Julie Bykowicz at the Associated Press reported earlier this month, \u201c\u2026 Some 62,462 presidential ads have been on broadcast airwaves already this year, according to advertising tracker Kantar Media\u2019s CMAG. The 2016 hopefuls and their related political groups, such as super PACs, have plans to spend $133 million on broadcast TV by the beginning of March, CMAG information shows.\u201d\n\nIs it any wonder local and national TV news is squeamish about taking on real, in-depth coverage of the campaigns that unload endless wheelbarrows of cash on their doorsteps?\n\nThis is why, despite the encroachments of cable, satellite and the Internet, local and network broadcast television is still such a money-making machine. At some TV stations, a third of advertising revenue comes from political ads.\n\nSo is it any wonder local and national TV news is squeamish about taking on real, in-depth coverage of the campaigns that unload endless wheelbarrows of cash on their doorsteps? That broadcast executives have no qualms about ruining the airwaves and honest discourse while taking glee at the windfalls of profits?\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the ferocity with which television stations and networks have been fighting against campaign finance reform, fearing the death \u2014 or at least hobbling \u2014 of the golden goose.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Political campaigns are spending more and more on ads to influence voters -- and network execs are cheering them on", "title": "Howard Beale would be mad as hell: Donald Trump, Les Moonves and the sale of American democracy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Political campaigns are spending more and more on ads to influence voters -- and network execs are cheering them on", "title": "Howard Beale would be mad as hell: Donald Trump, Les Moonves and the sale of American democracy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/19/howard_beale_would_be_mad_as_hell_donald_trump_les_moonves_and_the_sale_of_american_democracy_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/2015-12-181.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Political campaigns are spending more and more on ads to influence voters -- and network execs are cheering them on", "title": "Howard Beale would be mad as hell: Donald Trump, Les Moonves and the sale of American democracy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/2015-12-181.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Bill Moyers and Michael Winship", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, BillMoyers.com, CBS, Donald Trump, Les Moonves, Television", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2002\"", "article_summary": "Topics: BillMoyers.com, CBS, Donald Trump, Les Moonves, Television, Media News, Politics NewsThis piece originally appeared on BillMoyers.com.\nThe networks have grasped Donald Trump to their collective bosom like the winner of one of those misogynistic, televised beauty pageants he owns.\nIt found that from January 1 through November, the big three had devoted 234 minutes of reporting to Donald Trump but only ten to Bernie Sanders.\nThis is why, despite the encroachments of cable, satellite and the Internet, local and network broadcast television is still such a money-making machine.\nWhat\u2019s more, in an insane election cycle like this one, cash already is pouring in from the production, sale and placement of political TV advertising, cash that also makes television executives and political strategists wealthy."}
