See below.\n\nOn his Tuesday radio program, Washington, D.C.\u2019s WMAL talk show host Chris Plante revealed to his listeners that CNN president Jeff Zucker sees the criticism aimed at President Barack Obama over HealthCare.gov as not the product of a faulty website, but instead a product of racism.\n\nAccording to Plante, who was a former CNN correspondent, two sources had told him that Zucker made that claim in a 9 a.m. conference call to the various CNN bureaus around the country.\n\n\u201cNow as many of you know, I used to work at CNN \u2014 the cable news network,\u201d Plante said. \u201cAnd the big boss there now \u2014 they swap them out pretty regularly is this guy, Jeff Zucker. Well, Jeff Zucker on the 9 a.m. editorial conference call just the other day was speaking to the troops \u2014 you know, all the big people at the bureaus around the country, get on the phone for the 9 a.m. editorial call and the big boss, Jeff Zucker, kind of lays out their strategy, their plan for the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know \u2014 this is what we\u2019re going to cover, these are the big stories, keep this stuff in mind as you go about your day and all that stuff,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd according to two sources, CNN sources \u2014 on the 9 a.m. editorial call, he said all of this bashing of HealthCare.gov and the Obamacare thing was in the end \u2014 come on, take a guess \u2014 racist. That people are just saying Obama couldn\u2019t build a website because he is black and you know, they hate him. That\u2019s the president of CNN. That\u2019s Jeff Zucker. That\u2019s his guidance to the troops.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Caller reached out to CNN for a comment, but as of 5 p.m. ET, has not received a response.\n\nCNN\u2019s ratings have struggled lately under Zucker\u2019s guidance. Last week, CNN averaged just 385,000 total viewers and captured just 95,000 viewers in the coveted 25-54 demo.\n\nUpdate:\n\nA spokesperson from CNN denies the account.\n\n\u201cThat never happened, simply untrue,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email to The Daily Caller.\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Poor", "description": "Talk radio host and former CNN correspondent Chris Plante says sources say network president made remarks on editorial conference call", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "UPDATE: CNN responds.
