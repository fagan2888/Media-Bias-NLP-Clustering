To this day, it resonates in those cities with residents of a certain age who don\u2019t realize that its civic authenticity is on par with that of the local Hard Rock Caf\u00e9.\n\nThe story is a lesson in the power and peril of branding, and in particular, of sonic branding \u2014 associating sounds and music with products, companies, organizations and ideas. Global brands have sonic strategies, says Joel Beckerman, the founder of Man Made Music and composer of jingles for AT&T, CBS and others. So why not cities?\n\nBy strategy, Beckerman is referring to a much wider range of sonic interventions than tourist outreach of the \u201cHello Calgary\u201d type. There are foreground sounds like subway announcements, and background sounds like ambient music. Cities have a lot of \u201csonic trash,\u201d he says, and not enough \u201csonic feng shui.\u201d\n\nBeckerman has a new book out, \u201cThe Sonic Boom,\u201d about his life as a professional soundsmith. But, he insists \u2014 as if the goal were more modest \u2014 he\u2019s less interested in selling books than in starting a movement.\n\nBad sound, according to Beckerman, is \u201cas detrimental to quality of life as bad streetlights or poor sidewalks.\u201d (Like the high hat in a pop song, once you hear it, it can\u2019t be unheard.) He wants to urge us toward a \u201csonic humanism\u201d: an awareness of our sonic environment, and a cognizance that we can change it if we want to.\n\nThe artists Bruce Odland and Sam Auinger have called these spaces \u2014 from streets to parks to airports \u2014 the \u201csonic commons,\u201d where citizens \u201care submerged in a sea of shared sound.\u201d It\u2019s telling that discussion of city noise requires hitching common terms to the word \u201csonic.\u201d The field is young and frequently forced to piggyback on the ancient lexicon of architecture and visual arts. R. Murray Schafer, the father of acoustic ecology and author of \u201cThe Tuning of the World,\u201d coined both \u201csoundscape\u201d and \u201cearmark,\u201d alterations of their land-based equivalents. Shafer also suggested citizens try a \u201csoundwalk,\u201d a d\u00e9rive for the aurally inclined, \u201ca form of active participation in the soundscape.\u201d\n\nGenerally, advocates, artists and professionals like Beckerman tend to feel society has given sound short shrift. \u201cThe majority of architects do not make sound a primary consideration in the viability of the space,\u201d he told me.\n\n\u201cAll infrastructure is designed,\u201d Osland and Auinger write, \u201cOur ears were simply not part of the design brief.\u201d\n\nThis has practical consequences. Sound cues relieve your overworked eyes by sharing the burden of daily stimuli between the senses. Most pedestrians, whether they realize it or not, take their daytime jaywalking cues from sound as much as from sight. Drivers with standard transmissions hear and feel the engine telling them to switch gears.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bad sound is \"as detrimental to quality of life as bad streetlights or poor sidewalks,\u201d according to one expert", "title": "The sounds of our lives suck!
