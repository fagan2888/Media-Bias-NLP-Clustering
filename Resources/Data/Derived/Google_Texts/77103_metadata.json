After the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled that the group must comply with Obamacare\u2019s abortion mandate, The Little Sisters of the Poor found reprieve Friday morning after the Tenth Circuit issued an order temporarily safeguarding the group and other ministries from being forced to violate their faith. That is, until the Supreme Court rules on their case.\n\n\u201cThe federal government doesn\u2019t need the Little Sisters or any other ministry to help it distribute abortion-inducing drugs and other contraceptives,\u201d Mark Rienzi, senior counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents the Little Sisters, said in a statement. \u201cYet it not only insists on forcing them to participate in the delivery, it argues that their beliefs against participating are wrong and that government officials and judges can tell the Little Sisters what Catholic theology really requires. That\u2019s wrong, and it\u2019s dangerous \u2014 especially when those same government officials have disrespectfully compared the Sisters\u2019 beliefs to \u2018fighting an invisible dragon\u2019 that can be vanquished with the \u2018stroke of the [Sisters\u2019] own pen.\u2019\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor and several other ministries had appealed the July ruling to the High Court shortly after it was handed down, hoping for long-term relief from the HHS mandate. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the case this fall.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Good. .05/27/2016 8:50:24AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Good.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Little Sisters of the Poor Gets Short-term Relief From HHS Mandate", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/08/23/little-sisters-receive-shortterm-shelter-from-hhs-mandate-n2042105", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/204/6bda6ded-3385-4331-8f34-a01e84c0efef.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Good.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Little Sisters of the Poor Gets Short-term Relief From HHS Mandate", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/08/23/little-sisters-receive-shortterm-shelter-from-hhs-mandate-n2042105", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/204/6bda6ded-3385-4331-8f34-a01e84c0efef.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Little Sisters of the Poor Gets Short-term Relief From HHS Mandate, Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe federal government doesn\u2019t need the Little Sisters or any other ministry to help it distribute abortion-inducing drugs and other contraceptives,\u201d Mark Rienzi, senior counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents the Little Sisters, said in a statement.\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor has been through more than any faith-based charity should have to go through all to continue the noble work they\u2019re doing without violating their faith.\nThe Supreme Court is expected to rule on the case this fall.\nThat is, until the Supreme Court rules on their case.\n\u201cYet it not only insists on forcing them to participate in the delivery, it argues that their beliefs against participating are wrong and that government officials and judges can tell the Little Sisters what Catholic theology really requires."}
