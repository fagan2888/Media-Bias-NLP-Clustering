Burwell. With this opinion, the court preserved the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), keeping federal subsidies to people who buy their health insurance on the federal exchange intact.\n\nHad he changed his vote, Obamacare would be effectively dead.\n\nThis was Roberts\u2019 second time to save Obamacare. The first was three years ago, when Roberts recast Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate as a tax. Thirteen of 21 constitutional law experts interviewed by Bloomberg expected Obamacare to be gutted on a partisan 5-4 vote by the court, while 19 of 21 thought that it should be preserved. Their thinking was influenced by the apparently settled notion that the commerce clause allowed Congress to compel people into economic transactions, including the purchase of health insurance.\n\nRoberts surprised them and President Obama as well. He gave Obama his policy victory on the individual mandate, but at the same time he clamped down hard on the commerce clause. Roberts wrote then:\n\nConstruing the Commerce Clause to permit Congress to regulate individuals precisely because they are doing nothing would open a new and potentially vast domain to congressional authority. Congress already possesses expansive power to regulate what people do. Upholding the Affordable Care Act under the Commerce Clause would give Congress the same license to regulate what people do not do. The Framers knew the difference between doing something and doing nothing. They gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it. Ignoring that distinction would undermine the principle that the Federal Government is a government of limited and enumerated powers. The individual mandate thus cannot be sustained under Congress\u2019s power to \u2018regulate Commerce.\u2019\n\nWhen Obama opposed Roberts\u2019 nomination to the Court in 2005, he said that he did it out of concern for Roberts\u2019 philosophy on such issues as \u201cwhether the commerce clause empowers Congress to speak on those issues of broad national concern that may be only tangentially related to what is easily defined as interstate commerce.\u201d Roberts answered him in 2012 as Obama feared he would, with a strong \u201cno.\u201d\n\nRoberts\u2019 opinion in 2012 was a blow to conservatives who hated a specific policy. That policy survived. But at the same time, conservatives won a much broader philosophical victory, a strong barrier against expanded use of the commerce clause. The precedent there was as big a victory for conservatism as striking down the individual mandate would have been.\n\nWhat Roberts did last week involved a similar split, delivering a general win to conservatives while granting a policy win to Obama.\n\nMuch more important than the immediate conclusion of a Supreme Court opinion is the logic behind it. It is possible to win a policy victory while losing a philosophical war. For instance, conservatives opposed to abortion might find their joy turn to horror if the court banned abortion, but reasoned its way to that outcome by arguing that the state did, in fact, have final authority over all aspects of reproduction. How you get your victory is every bit as important as the victory itself.\n\nWith his opinion on Burwell, Roberts shifted power from agencies like the IRS and EPA onto the courts; Congress has shifted a great deal of its own power onto those so-called \u201cadministrative agencies,\u201d which now have the authority to interpret the law broadly, then issue regulations to give their interpretations the weight of law. The power of those agencies can now be much more easily circumscribed by the courts.\n\nThe general expectation before last week was that if the court upheld the legality of the federal subsidies, it would appeal to Chevron deference. The principle of Chevron deference is named for a 1984 Supreme Court case, Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. The case dealt with the way the Environmental Protection Agency interpreted the Clean Air Act amendments of 1977.\n\nChevron deference means that, even if the court finds that there are better interpretations of the law than those applied by an administrative agency, the court must defer to the agency if its interpretation is at all reasonable. The EPA, the IRS and every other administrative agency is allowed to interpret the law as it sees fit, so long as its interpretation is reasonable.\n\nThe concept of \u201creasonableness\u201d rests on ambiguity. Laws can\u2019t cover every possible contingency; legislators can\u2019t possibly imagine every situation that might occur that is relevant to the law.\n\nWhere the law is unambiguous, the clear letter of the law is the law. Where the law is ambiguous, the administrative agency must interpret the law for itself, so long as its interpretation is not \u201carbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\u201d That is a very low standard, giving the agency extremely wide latitude to decide for itself how to enforce the law.\n\nRoberts pulled back on Chevron deference. He wrote in last week\u2019s opinion:\n\nWhen analyzing an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute, we often apply the two-step framework announced in Chevron , 467 U. S. 837. Under that framework, we ask whether the statute is ambiguous and, if so, whether the agency\u2019s interpretation is reasonable. \u2026 This approach \u2018is premised on the theory that a statute\u2019s ambiguity constitutes an implicit delegation from Congress to the agency to fill in the statutory gaps.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018In extraordinary cases, however, there may be reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress has intended such an implicit delegation.\u2019\n\nThis is one of those cases. The tax credits are among the Act\u2019s key reforms, involving billions of dollars in spending each year and affecting the price of health insurance for millions of people. Whether those credits are available on Federal Exchanges is thus a question of deep \u201ceconomic and political significance\u201d that is central to this statutory scheme; had Congress wished to assign that question to an agency, it surely would have done so expressly. \u2026 It is especially unlikely that Congress would have delegated this decision to the IRS, which has no expertise in crafting health insurance policy of this sort. \u2026 This is not a case for the IRS.\n\nRoberts\u2019 reasoning holds two important implications. First, because the court has interpreted the law itself, a change in administrations won\u2019t change the interpretation. If a Republican is elected in 2016, he can\u2019t decide that federal subsidies will only be provided to people who buy health insurance on state exchanges. The interpretation is now set until the law is changed or repealed, or until the Supreme Court returns to this issue and changes its interpretation.\n\nSecond, as we already noted, the court has suddenly circumscribed the power of future administrations to interpret any law. Whether the courts will pursue Roberts\u2019 precedent to assert limits on executive power remains to be seen, but Roberts\u2019 opinion gives them that option. They need no longer simply accept that the administration\u2019s approach is \u201creasonable,\u201d hence inviolable.\n\nThis, like Roberts\u2019 restrictions on the use of the commerce clause, is potentially an important gain for conservative government. Only potential, however. The executive branch can be counted on to act to protect and expand its authority. Power goes where it\u2019s used, not where statute or even court opinions say it belongs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chief Justice Roberts has outraged conservatives with his opinions on Obamacare, but those opinions preserve a liberal policy with conservative reasoning.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Jim Picht", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "Chief Justice Roberts has outraged conservatives with his opinions on Obamacare, but those opinions preserve a liberal policy with conservative reasoning.", "title": "The paradoxical John Roberts and Obamacare", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/politics-2/the-paradoxical-john-roberts-and-obamacare-44237/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John-Roberts-Chief-Justice-John-Roberts.jpg", "height": 482}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chief Justice Roberts has outraged conservatives with his opinions on Obamacare, but those opinions preserve a liberal policy with conservative reasoning.", "title": "The paradoxical John Roberts and Obamacare", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/John-Roberts-Chief-Justice-John-Roberts-435x375.jpg", "creator": "@jwpicht", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "obamacare,aca,chief justice,john roberts,supreme court,commerce clause", "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-02T02:08:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-06T02:39:35+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ACA, Chief Justice, Commerce Clause, John Roberts, obamacare, Supreme Court"}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe4fcc\"", "article_summary": "This, like Roberts\u2019 restrictions on the use of the commerce clause, is potentially an important gain for conservative government.\nWhether the courts will pursue Roberts\u2019 precedent to assert limits on executive power remains to be seen, but Roberts\u2019 opinion gives them that option.\nUpholding the Affordable Care Act under the Commerce Clause would give Congress the same license to regulate what people do not do.\nHe gave Obama his policy victory on the individual mandate, but at the same time he clamped down hard on the commerce clause.\nRoberts wrote then:Construing the Commerce Clause to permit Congress to regulate individuals precisely because they are doing nothing would open a new and potentially vast domain to congressional authority."}
