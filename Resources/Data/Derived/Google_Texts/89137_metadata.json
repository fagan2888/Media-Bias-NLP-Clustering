The U.S. is slated to mostly pull out of Afghanistan by the end of July. \u201cBy the end of this year, the transition will be complete and Afghans will take full responsibility for their security, and our combat mission will be over,\u201d Mr. Obama told troops during a surprise trip to Afghanistan over the weekend. On Wednesday, it\u2019s step one of the president\u2019s foreign-policy push with his commencement address at West Point. Next week, he will travel to Europe, where he will deliver yet another speech in Poland. It\u2019s all part of the 70th anniversary of D-Day at Normandy commemorations. The speech at West Point will \u201clay out [the president\u2019s] broad vision for U.S. foreign policy and our role in the world,\u201d a senior White House official told Morning Line. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot at stake and now is the right time for this speech.\u201d Continuing to try and learn the lessons and mistakes of former President George W. Bush\u2019s foreign policy \u2014 most notably the decision to go to war in Iraq \u2014 Mr. Obama is aiming to lay out a foreign policy \u201cthat is both interventionist and internationalist, but not isolationist or unilateral.\u201d Talk about trying to thread a needle.\n\nTrying to take control of the message: The official also said the president wants to take the reins of foreign policy now, especially because the administration has been forced to address events outside his control, from the Snowden revelations to Syria to Ukraine. \u201cOver the last 6-9 months, we\u2019ve had to respond to a series of big events rather than talking about our overarching policy,\u201d the official said, adding, \u201cThe United States is the only nation capable of galvanizing action and the president will explain why we need to put that to use in an international system that is sustainable and enduring, and that can address challenges from traditional ones, like maritime and trade issues, to emerging ones, like climate change.\u201d Expect other administration officials like Secretary of State John Kerry and others to pick up on the message. It is pretty fascinating (and scary) to think about where the world will go and what America\u2019s role in it will be in this post-9/11, post-Iraq and Afghanistan world.\n\nThe risk of overplaying your hand: It\u2019s been true over the last several years that both sides have had a hard time taking their ball and going home. Or at least figuring out how to artfully deal with a political \u201cwin\u201d without looking political. That got blundered Monday when Republican Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina decided to pick a fight with veterans groups on Memorial Day for not speaking out more strongly for Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign. In an open letter to veterans, Burr chided veterans\u2019 service organizations \u2014 aside from the American Legion \u2014 charging they \u201cappear to be more interested in defending the status quo within VA, protecting their relationships within the agency, and securing their access to the Secretary and his inner circle.\u201d And he declared they were \u201cmore interested in their own livelihoods and Washington connections than they are to the needs of their own members.\u201d It sounds like the kind of email you write but don\u2019t send and then come back to it and delete it because, \u201cWhat was I thinking?\u201d\n\n\u2018Worst of politics\u2019: As to be expected, Burr\u2019s letter was NOT well received by the VSOs, many of which called for reforms at a hearing last week but notably didn\u2019t go as far as the American Legion in seeking Shinseki\u2019s resignation. Both Paralyzed Veterans of America and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, or VFW, said Burr \u201cshould be ashamed.\u201d Paralyzed Veterans said Burr \u201crepresents the worst of politics\u201d and pointed out that he voted against measures that would have given more resources to the VA to try and fix the problems. And it pointed out that Burr was not present when the organizations testified and \u201cdid not ask a single question to gauge our recommendations about how to fix the problems the VA health care system.\u201d The VFW also pointed at Congress. \u201cIf we\u2019ve been remiss in anything Senator,\u201d the group wrote, \u201cwe\u2019ve been remiss in being too polite with Congress. For years, the VFW has come to Congress with hat in hand and for years, we\u2019ve heard the same old story. You can be assured Senator, that you\u2019ve done a superb job in showing us the error in our ways.\u201d Disabled Veterans of America echoed that, accusing Burr of playing politics and noting that replacing one secretary won\u2019t solve the VA\u2019s problems. \u201cRegrettably,\u201d the group\u2019s national commander wrote, \u201cSenator Burr shows no interest in pursuing serious policy solutions, preferring instead to launch cheap political attacks.\u201d Burr stood by his letter, saying it \u201chit a nerve\u201d and charging that veterans groups have \u201cshown more outrage toward my open letter than outrage toward the current crisis at the V.A.\u201d The art of politics is scoring political points while at least maintaining a guise of trying to do what\u2019s best for the country. If Burr was trying to do that, this wasn\u2019t his best effort. Burr is probably lucky he isn\u2019t up for reelection this year.\n\nTexas primary runoff: Tuesday\u2019s another primary day with the runoff elections in Texas. There are two races to watch, including whether Ralph Hall, who at 91 is the oldest member of Congress, becomes the first congressional incumbent of the cycle to lose. So far, they are 139-for-139. He is running against former U.S. attorney John Ratcliffe, who is 48 and has subtly raised the issue of Hall\u2019s age. His campaign slogan: \u201cA New Generation of Conservative Leadership.\u201d Hall placed first in the March primary with 45 percent of the vote compared to 29 percent for Ratcliffe. Getting that extra 5 percent could be a hurdle for Hall, considering he\u2019s the only member of Congress anyone in this district has known for 34 years.\n\nReality check on Democrats\u2019 chances in Texas \u2014 and the tea party has already won: The latest tea party vs. establishment battle of the primary season also takes place Tuesday in the Lone Star State in the lieutenant governor\u2019s race. Democrats hope to contest \u2014 and win their first statewide seat in 20 years \u2014 if the tea party candidate wins. But Democrats\u2019 candidate, Leticia van de Putte, trails in the polls, and despite being Latina and having served in the state legislature for 24 years is not well known among Latinos statewide. In Tuesday\u2019s race, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst faces a runoff contest against state Sen. Dan Patrick, a former radio host who founded the tea party caucus in the Texas legislature. Patrick, who outpaced Dewhurst by 13 points in the four-candidate March primary, appears poised to pick up the win and knock Dewhurst from the office he has held for more than a decade. It would mark the second time in as many cycles that Dewhurst was overtaken by an insurgent candidate, having lost to Ted Cruz in the 2012 Senate GOP primary race. But the big story in Texas is, regardless of the outcomes Tuesday, how the tea party has already won in the state. The Dallas Morning News: \u201cThe victor in Tuesday\u2019s runoff elections is already known. The tea party has won big. \u2026 In virtually every Republican matchup, candidates have espoused the movement\u2019s talking points, attended groups\u2019 forums, and adopted their issues.\u201d\n\nDaily Presidential Trivia: On this day in 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt proclaimed an \u201cunlimited national emergency\u201d in response to threats of world domination by Nazi Germany.
