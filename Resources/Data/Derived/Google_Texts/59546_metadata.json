In fact, any immigrant that passed the test to become a citizen has a better grasp on the practical aspects of citizenship, and the rights and duties to each other as members of American society than most Americans. More than anything, a naturalized citizen understands how the government operates according to the United States Constitution, and regardless their claim to strictly adhere to its tenets, conservatives have no comprehension of the nation\u2019s founding document. This weekend a group of vigilante truck drivers will set upon Washington to demonstrate that when it comes to Constitutional ignorance, they have few peers outside the Republican Party.\n\nThe truckers calling themselves \u201cTruckers for the Constitution\u201d plan to shut down I-495 until law enforcement arrests Democratic legislators who \u201cviolated their oath of office\u201d and \u201cdisregard the Constitution.\u201d (Editor\u2019s Note: The truckers have since walked back this threat.)The rally\u2019s coordinators say truckers are sick and tired of EPA fuel efficiency standards, the Affordable Care Act, state and local laws regarding idling their trucks, and \u201cinsurance companies purportedly requiring technological updates.\u201d The vigilante truckers plan to drive three abreast on the \u201cBeltway\u201d that circles Washington to obstruct traffic except for drivers who have \u201cT2SDA\u201d written on their vehicle. T2SDA is an acronym for the tractor-trailer drivers\u2019 name for their event, \u201cTruckers to Shut Down America.\u201d According to Earl Conlon, a Georgia trucker, \u201ceverybody that doesn\u2019t have a supporter sticker on their window, good luck: Nobody in, nobody out\u201d and likely they will incur a response from law enforcement for trapping motorists on a federal highway.\n\nConlon warned law enforcement in advance that if they do not allow the truckers to obstruct traffic, they will \u201clock the brakes up, and stop right there, we\u2019re going to be a three lane roadblock.\u201d A country singer affiliated with the truck drivers claimed they will present their demands to congressional representatives and if they agree to the truckers\u2019 demands they will cancel the road block. It is unclear why the truckers believe blocking a major thoroughfare will eliminate EPA regulations, insurance industry requirements, and the health law, or what they have to do with the Constitution or Democrats violating their oath of office, but they \u201cwant these people arrested, and we\u2019re coming in with the grand jury to do it. We are going to ask the law enforcement to uphold their constitutional oath and make these arrests. If they refuse to do it, by the power of the people of the United States and the people\u2019s grand jury, [if] they don\u2019t want to do it, we will. \u2026 We the people will find a way.\u201d It is the second time in less than a month that extremist conservatives cited vigilante grand juries as a means of clearing Democrats out of government and throwing them in prison.\n\nAbout three weeks ago another conservative vigilante warned of the impending consequences from the \u201cpeople\u2019s grand juries\u201d and announced plans to march on the White House sometime close to Thanksgiving and demand that President Obama surrender to religious teabaggers. Larry Klayman believes a million extremists will surround the White House and chant \u201cMr. President, put the Quran down, get up off your knees, and come out with your hands up\u201d because \u201cRepublicans, the judicial system, and government officials lack the will or courage to remove the mullah-in-chief from office.\u201d The tractor-trailer drivers claim they are not demanding the President\u2019s impeachment and only want to arrest legislators such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senator Barbara Boxer because they disregard the Constitution and violate their oath of office according to indictments handed down by \u201cthe people\u2019s grand juries.\u201d\n\nA \u201cpeople\u2019s grand jury\u201d is a non-actionable, non-governmental vigilante organization assuming responsibility to indict an individual or groups of individuals of committing actionable crimes similar to an official grand jury. People\u2019s grand juries are favored by conspiracy theorists like those seated to challenge President Obama\u2019s birth certificate, and are loosely based on the Fifth Amendment premise that \u201cno person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury.\u201d A band of jurors convened without court approval has no standing or authority to indict or issue arrest warrants for public officials, and law enforcement certainly will not recognize or execute a fake indictment, but that is of no consequence to constitutionally ignorant vigilantes.\n\nIt is unclear why conservatives became so obsessed with enforcing their version of the Constitution through vigilantism, but it likely has everything to do with an African American President. One also wonders if the \u201cconstitutional genius\u201d truck drivers comprehend that the laws and agencies they so despise were passed and executed according to the real U.S. Constitution, because their not-so-veiled threats imply they have legitimate legal standing to take the law into their own hands.\n\nLike the extremist who intends on marching on the White House, the vigilante truckers\u2019 organizer leveled a veiled threat of violence if they are held to the laws of the road or prohibition on kidnapping U.S. Representatives to Congress. The man organizing the million person assault on the White House to arrest President Obama said, \u201cI do not advocate violence, but it is time we show Obama that we mean business,\u201d and the vigilante truckers\u2019 spokesperson parroted Klayman only with stronger language. He said, \u201cWhat we want to do is go in nice and peaceful and keep it as peaceful as possible\u2026 but if they decide to get ugly with us we\u2019re going to do what we have to do. If all I get is one or two congressmen walked out of there in handcuffs, that will be a shot across the bow. I hope they are all civil enough and brave enough to step out onto the congressional steps.\u201d\n\nIt is highly probable that if a vigilante gang parks in front of the Capital building waiting for congressional representatives to step out on the \u201ccongressional steps,\u201d they will be accompanied by federal law enforcement officials who will not take kindly to vigilante truckers attempting to kidnap U.S. Representatives based on phony indictments from an equally phony people\u2019s grand jury. However, at the rate extremist conservatives and so-called constitutional adherents are threatening Democratic representatives and President Obama with arrest, it is entirely possible they will come to Washington heavily armed and looking for trouble. It is, after all, what constitutionally ignorant vigilantes are prone to do and when they do start trouble, they can be certain a real grand jury will hand down real indictments for insurrection against the government of the United States.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A group of vigilante truck drivers will set upon Washington to demonstrate that when it comes to Constitutional ignorance, they have few peers outside the Republican Party.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rmuse", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "A group of vigilante truck drivers will set upon Washington to demonstrate that when it comes to Constitutional ignorance, they have few peers outside the Republican Party.", "title": "Protesting Right Wing Truckers Are Hauling a Load of Constitutional Ignorance", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2013/10/09/protesting-wing-truckers-hauling-load-constitutional-ignorance.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/vigilantes.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-09T20:24:42+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Congress,Earl Conlon,Grand Jury,kidnapping congressional representatives,Larry Klayman,Law Enforcement,people's grand juries,Truck driver,Truckers for the Constitution,United States Constitution,vigilanties,Washington,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2013-10-09T20:24:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-09T20:24:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Congress, Earl Conlon, Grand Jury, kidnapping congressional representatives, Larry Klayman, Law Enforcement, people's grand juries, Truck driver, Truckers for the Constitution, United States Constitution, vigilanties, Washington"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce384\"", "article_summary": "We are going to ask the law enforcement to uphold their constitutional oath and make these arrests.\nRepresentatives based on phony indictments from an equally phony people\u2019s grand jury.\nIf they refuse to do it, by the power of the people of the United States and the people\u2019s grand jury, [if] they don\u2019t want to do it, we will.\nThe truckers calling themselves \u201cTruckers for the Constitution\u201d plan to shut down I-495 until law enforcement arrests Democratic legislators who \u201cviolated their oath of office\u201d and \u201cdisregard the Constitution.\u201d (Editor\u2019s Note: The truckers have since walked back this threat.\nThis weekend a group of vigilante truck drivers will set upon Washington to demonstrate that when it comes to Constitutional ignorance, they have few peers outside the Republican Party."}
