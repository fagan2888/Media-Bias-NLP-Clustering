During a discussion on Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech before Congress, Feinstein touted the importance of a deal with Iran and took issue with Netanyahu’s claim that an agreement could endanger Israel’s existence. She further said, “we have a Middle East that’s coming apart now. We’ve got ISIL and ISIS, they occupy a third of the territory of Syria. They occupy about 9 or 10 cities in Iraq. They are forming their own government. They are occupying land, which is a new thing for a terrorist group. And you have Yemen in trouble. you have Egypt in transition. You have Libya close to a civil war, and you have Jordan and Lebanon in danger.”

Later, Feinstein did tout the success of the US’ counter-ISIS operations.
