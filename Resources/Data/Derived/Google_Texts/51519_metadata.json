They argue this violates ObamaCare\u2019s rules prohibiting discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions, because it makes the coverage unaffordable.\n\nThe say state and federal regulators should be paying more attention to the insurance company policies for designing \u201cformularies,\u201d lists of drugs that fall under certain categories for the purpose of determining patient co-pays.\n\n\u201cWhen plans are not prohibited from designing formularies in this manner, high out-of-pocket costs are concentrated among a subset of patients, potentially undermining the very purpose of insurance,\u201d said PhRMA. \u201cAdditional oversight and stronger standards for formulary design would help prevent the practices described in this report.\u201d\n\nPhRMA CEO John Castellani said the Department of Health and Human Services should release guidance immediately on how much insurance plans can charge for specialty drugs.\n\nAs insurers begin to publish their plans ahead of the 2015 enrollment period, Castellani said it was important to have guidance that could limit patient co-insurance.\n\nThe AIDS institute, which attended Wednesday\u2019s event at the National Press Club, has filed a complaint against some health insurers in Florida for putting too much burden on HIV/AIDS patients to pay for drugs. They say some patients must pay 40 percent or more of drugs that result in out-of-pocket costs that average $1,000 per month.\n\nPhRMA said it supports the move but does not intend to join the complaint.\n\nOther groups present at the release including Health HIV, Colon Cancer Alliance and Immune Deficiency Foundation said they have joined or are joining the complaint.\n\nThe American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association said it would join any potential appeal if the complaint failed to illicit the right response in the first round.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "PhRMA accuses insurers of discrminating against patients.", "description": "PhRMA accuses insurers of discrminating against patients.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Ferdous Al-Faruque", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "PhRMA accuses insurers of discrminating against patients.", "title": "Drug-makers launch counter-attack on insurers", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/208994-drug-makers-launch-counter-attack-on-insurers", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/208994-drug-makers-launch-counter-attack-on-insurers", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-06-11T12:11-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ferdous Al-Faruque", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-11T12:11:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "keywords": "Medicine, Health insurance, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, AIDS, Copayment, Health, ObamaCare,,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/208994-drug-makers-launch-counter-attack-on-insurers", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "PhRMA accuses insurers of discrminating against patients.", "card": "summary", "title": "Drug-makers launch counter-attack on insurers"}, "dcterms.title": "Drug-makers launch counter-attack on insurers"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc10e\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTPhRMA\u2019s comments are the latest jab in its fight with America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the main lobbying group representing insurers.\nDrugmakers and advocacy groups say insurers are charging co-pays that are too high for drugs to treat chronic diseases.\nDrug-makers on Wednesday slammed the health insurance industry for over-charging patients who suffer from cancer and other diseases for drugs.\nAHIP has accused drug-makers of pushing up prices of specialty drugs, costs of which insurers in turn have passed on to patients through higher cost-sharing plans.\nThey say some patients must pay 40 percent or more of drugs that result in out-of-pocket costs that average $1,000 per month."}
