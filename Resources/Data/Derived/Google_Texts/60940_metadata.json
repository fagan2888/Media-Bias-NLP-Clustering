Orrin Hatch wants the administration to investigate who owes the feds money.\n\nThe Republican chair of the Senate Finance Committee has asked the IRS\u2019s Treasury inspector general for tax administration to look into who\u2019s receiving the taxpayer subsidies under Obamacare and whether they owe money back to the federal government. IRS commissioner John Koskinen revealed to Hatch just last week that 710,000 Obamacare customers who received Obamacare subsidies last year both failed to file tax returns \u2014 a step required of all those who receive Obamacare\u2019s advanced premium tax credits to allay the cost of their coverage \u2014 nor did they request an extension for their tax returns.\n\nAll that money adds up. Hatch points out that because on average, Obamacare customers received $3,400 in subsidies, those 710,000 customers who did not update file their tax returns \u201clikely received more than $2.4 billion in advanced credit payments alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cA critical element in safeguarding the integrity of insurance subsidies is the reconciliation process that occurs when taxpayers file their tax returns and reconcile subsidies received versus the amount they were in fact due,\u201d Hatch wrote to J. Russell George, the IG for tax administration. \u201cWhile it is likely that not all of these are fraudulent, because of the Marketplace\u2019s lax integrity controls there is reason to believe that a significant portion could be.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not the only concerning information to crop up about the subsidies, either \u2014 the Government Accountability Office revealed last week that in an undercover test of the federal Obamacare exchange, investigators were able to get 11 of 12 fake customers health insurance and subsidies complete with fake identities and fake documents with little trouble \u2014 complete with $30,000 in subsidies.

(RELATED: Federal Investigators Got Obamacare Subsidies With Fake Identities, Docs)\n\nHatch is looking for the IRS watchdog to audit a \u201clarge sampling\u201d of the 2014 group of Obamacare customers, checking that customers are using their true identities and that they qualify for the amount of premium subsidy they\u2019ve received.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
