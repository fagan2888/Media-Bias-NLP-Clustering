Loren Hart, 40, of Jersey City used to describe Barnas, based on the three years he worked with him at Ladder Co. 6.\n\nHart said that while some firefighters treated fighting fires as just a job, it took on a much more profound meaning for Barnas.\n\n\u201cFor someone like him who volunteered not only in his town, but statewide in terms of teaching, it\u2019s a vocation,\u201d he said. \u201cHe really was an outstanding fireman, and that\u2019s the highest compliment you can pay a firefighter.\u201d\n\nFlags in Jersey City were flown at half-staff and bunting was placed on Barnas\u2019 firehouse. On two Facebook pages created after Barnas\u2019 death, tributes were posted from all over the East Coast by firefighters he trained.\n\nAt the scene of a Jersey City fire yesterday, Deputy Fire Chief Kevin Stewart testified to Barnas\u2019 dedication to his work, calling his death a \u201ccolossal, tragic loss ... He went above and beyond off-duty and on-duty.\u201d\n\nBarnas, who joined the Jersey City Fire Department in 1985 and was promoted to captain in 2003, served as company officer of Ladder 6 for the better part of his career, the JCFD said in a statement released today.\n\nBarnas is survived by his wife, Patty, and his two sons, Kevin and John. Kevin became a Jersey City firefighter last June and John aspires to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps.\n\nKevin and John Barnas were both at the scene of the Wallington fire when their father tumbled to his death.\n\n\u201cHe died doing what he loved, and there\u2019s something noble about that,\u201d Hart said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the only consolation we have for this type of loss.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "jersey-city", "title": "Jersey City firefighters who worked with Wallington fire captain who died on job recall a man who went above duty", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Jersey City firefighters who worked with Wallington fire captain who died on job recall a man who went above duty \", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/03/jersey_city_firefighters_who_w.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/02/14383077-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12321572\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-01T08:04:38Z\", \"author\": \"Jonathan Lin | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"jersey-city\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/02/14383077-small.jpg", "description": "Unlike the chaotic, panic-inducing fires he so often fought, Gregory Barnas always exuded a calmness that was ideal for his job, a fellow Jersey City fire captain told The Jersey Journal yesterday.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, March 01, 2014,  3:04 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/02/14383077-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"jclin\", \"author_nickname\": \"Jonathan Lin | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"11098115\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Unlike the chaotic, panic-inducing fires he so often fought, Gregory Barnas always exuded a calmness that was ideal for his job, a fellow Jersey City fire captain told The Jersey Journal yesterday.", "title": "Jersey City firefighters who worked with Wallington fire captain who died on job recall a man who went above duty", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/03/jersey_city_firefighters_who_w.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, March 01, 2014,  3:01 AM", "article_author": "Jonathan Lin | The Jersey Journal", "Description": "Unlike the chaotic, panic-inducing fires he so often fought, Gregory Barnas always exuded a calmness that was ideal for his job, a fellow Jersey City fire captain told The Jersey Journal yesterday."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf72c\"", "article_summary": "Loren Hart, 40, of Jersey City used to describe Barnas, based on the three years he worked with him at Ladder Co. 6.\nUnlike the chaotic, panic-inducing fires he so often fought, Gregory Barnas always exuded a calmness that was ideal for his job, a fellow Jersey City fire captain told The Jersey Journal yesterday.\nKevin became a Jersey City firefighter last June and John aspires to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps.\nBarnas, 57, of Wallington, died yesterday while fighting a fire in his hometown after he fell off its roof.\nKevin and John Barnas were both at the scene of the Wallington fire when their father tumbled to his death."}
