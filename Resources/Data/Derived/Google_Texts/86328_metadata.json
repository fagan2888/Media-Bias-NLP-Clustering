Like if he heard NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell ask Hillary Clinton in a recent interview, \u201cDoes it hurt you when people say you are too lawyerly, you parse your words, you are not authentic, you\u2019re not connecting?\u201d\n\nOr when the Wall Street Journal published a piece suggesting so much of what Clinton does sounds \u201cscripted and poll-tested.\u201d Or when Politico declared she\u2019s a White House hopeful \u201cwith an authenticity problem.\u201d Or when the Washington Post reported, \u201cHer campaign has struggled to present her as authentic and relatable.\u201d Or when McClatchy Newspapers asked \u201cIs Hillary Clinton Authentic Enough for Voters,\u201d and likened her to Richard Nixon.\n\n\u201cAuthenticity\u201d has clearly become the Beltway media\u2019s latest buzzword to describe what\u2019s supposedly wrongwith Clinton\u2019s campaign, even as she continues to have a sizeable national lead over her Democratic competitors.\n\nThe answer: She\u2019s a phony.\n\nWhy is this all likely ringing in Gore\u2019s ears? Because the last White House campaign that the Beltway press openly waged war against (the way it\u2019s now openly waging war on the Clinton campaign) was Gore\u2019s 2000 push. The Beltway elites hated Gore and didn\u2019t try to hide it, just like so many journalists seem to openly despise Clinton today. (\u201cReporters liked Bush and didn\u2019t like Gore,\u201d observed Paul Krugman at the New York Times.)\n\nIn 2000, Gore was widely ridiculed in the press as the wooden, over-calculating, poll-driven phony who was running against the epitome of true authenticity: George W. Bush. Sure, Gore knew his stuff cold and Bush seemed wobbly on the facts, and forget that Bush\u2019s entire campaign turned out to be built around the staged-crafted prevarication known as \u201ccompassionate conservativism.\u201d The press loved the Bush image and couldn\u2019t stand the Gore persona \u2014 The New York Times mocked him as \u201cEddie Haskell,\u201d the neighborhood brownnoser from Leave It To Beaver.\n\nThe press dutifully spent the entire campaign regurgitating the Republicans\u2019 playbook on Gore: he\u2019s a phony who can\u2019t be trusted. Fast-forward and the Republican playbook reads the same on Clinton: She\u2019s a phony who can\u2019t be trusted. So yes, the media\u2019s current authenticity chatter plays right into the GOP\u2019s hands. It perfectly coincides with conservative talking points about how to undermine the Democratic frontrunner.\n\nBut the authenticity math doesn\u2019t seem to add up.\n\nIn 2008, Clinton tallied 18 million votes during the Democratic primary season. Obviously, she lost to Barack Obama but how did she win a whopping 18 million votes if, according to the press, she can\u2019t connect with people due to her utter lack of authenticity? (Reminder: Clinton won her 2000 New York Senate race in alandslide.)\n\nThe recent \u201cauthenticity\u201d wave began with a New York Times article that claimed \u201cthere will be new efforts to bring spontaneity to a candidacy that sometimes seems wooden and overly cautious.\u201d The piece came complete with the mocking headline, \u201cHillary Clinton to Show More Humor and Heart, Aides Say.\u201d (Punch line: Clinton\u2019s handlers have to instruct her be warm and funny?)", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Beltway media's newest talking point is that Clinton is some kind of phony.
