She\u2019ll bump into a special-education teacher or a social worker who once helped her foster daughter, Deltrece Benson.\n\nShe has gotten random calls from the homicide detective who first caught the case, and a call from one of the early suspects, who later was cleared. Feb. 10 marked the 25th year since Deltrece, age 12, was murdered, found by the landlord alone in the family\u2019s apartment with two scarves tied around her neck.\n\nAnd for the 25th year, McKenna grieved and wondered what more she could do to coax a witness forward. As she always does, she went downtown to the homicide unit of the Minneapolis Police Department and gave the detective handling the case, Sgt. Darcy Klund, a plant with a purple ribbon, Deltrece\u2019s favorite color.\n\nIt\u2019s both a thank you to the officers for their work on the case and a reminder that justice still has a score to settle.\n\nThe murder of Deltrece has been a mystery for as long as the missing-person case of Jacob Wetterling, but few have heard about Deltrece. McKenna has spoken, appeared and exchanged hugs with the Wetterlings many times over those years.\n\nLike the Wetterlings, she knows if there is any hope of finding the person who did it, she needs to keep bringing the case to the public. I wrote about the effort by Mc\u00adKenna and police five years ago, and told her I would try again, in case there is someone out there who knows something.\n\nWhen she was murdered, police believed, and still believe, that the killer was someone familiar. While her mother, Jodi Benson, was out that night, she let the killer into the apartment.\n\nWhen Benson called home to check on her daughter, there was no answer. So the mother called the landlord, who discovered the body.\n\nPolice initially arrested a 15-year-old boy on suspicion of the murder, but released him when the facts didn\u2019t match, McKenna said.\n\n\u201cI actually remember the case well because it was one of the few we didn\u2019t solve,\u201d said Brad Johnson, who went on to head the city\u2019s homicide unit. Johnson, now retired, said \u201cthe case does still bug me.\u201d\n\nWhen Deltrece was younger, Benson struggled to care for her, so child protection workers moved the girl to the McKenna home in Prior Lake.\n\nDeltrece was eventually returned home but continued to spend every other weekend with her foster family as \u201crespite\u201d for her mother, and a chance to continue the relationship with the McKennas, who grew close with the girl despite their different backgrounds.\n\n\u201cMy sons are now 32 and 34, and the murder has greatly affected their lives,\u201d said McKenna. \u201cShe was a big sister to them.\u201d\n\nDeltrece grew while she was with the McKennas.\n\n\u201cShe played basketball and softball,\u201d said McKenna. \u201cShe joined the Girl Scouts. I still run into some of her classmates and they have families and kids \u2014 the kind of life she could have.\u201d\n\nAll of them ask about Deltrece, and about any progress on her case.\n\n\u201cYou forget the ripple effects you have on other people,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cShe was quite entertaining for a 12-year-old. She did a lot of living in a very short time.\u201d\n\nMcKenna said Deltrece was captivated at breakfast by the pictures of missing kids on milk cartons. She did not foresee that her foster mom would one day share grief with the mother of Minnesota\u2019s most famous missing child.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to do something for missing kids,\u201d said McKenna. \u201cShe wanted to be somebody like John Walsh,\u201d host of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Wanted\u201d and head of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.\n\nMaybe Deltrece\u2019s dream was a good omen. The detective who now has her case, Klund, was named an \u201cAll Star\u201d by Walsh\u2019s show in 2011 for his work to solve the 1990 stabbing of 11-year-old Marcus Potts in 2006, and his persistence in solving the 2003 shooting death of Marcus Dortch, whose killer was convicted in 2010.\n\nKlund says solving a case that\u2019s been cold so long will take continued diligence and some luck.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take somebody coming forward that knows more than what\u2019s being said,\u201d said Klund. It\u2019s highly likely the killer has told someone, Klund said. He\u2019s had cases where a witness finds a conscience, or maybe gets arrested themselves and gives up the suspect to cut a deal.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing I would like [more] than to have one of those moments,\u201d Klund said. People may have information on the case and \u201cdon\u2019t know the value of what they have.\u201d\n\nWhenever police solve a cold case, it tends to elicit a lot of calls from other families with open cases. \u201cIt sort of revives things for the families because it gives them hope. It reassures the families that we are still working on cases and gives the public the sense we are never going to give up.\u201d\n\nBut Deltrece never got the chance to follow any dream. She was buried at Hillside Cemetery. Her headstone reads, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, be happy.\u201d\n\nFollow Jon on Twitter: @jontevlin", "article_metadata": {"description": "The memories come back to Mary McKenna in odd ways.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The memories come back to Mary McKenna in odd ways.", "title": "Tevlin: 25 years later foster mom still hopes a killer is found", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/tevlin-25-years-later-foster-mom-still-hopes-a-killer-is-found/291968421/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The memories come back to Mary McKenna in odd ways.", "title": "Tevlin: 25 years later foster mom still hopes a killer is found", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/tevlin-25-years-later-foster-mom-still-hopes-a-killer-is-found/291968421/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464201858"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "Mary McKenna"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "Darcy Klund,Deltrece Benson,Mary McKenna"}, "article_summary": "She did not foresee that her foster mom would one day share grief with the mother of Minnesota\u2019s most famous missing child.\nShe\u2019ll bump into a special-education teacher or a social worker who once helped her foster daughter, Deltrece Benson.\nAnd for the 25th year, McKenna grieved and wondered what more she could do to coax a witness forward.\nWhile her mother, Jodi Benson, was out that night, she let the killer into the apartment.\nWhen she was murdered, police believed, and still believe, that the killer was someone familiar."}
