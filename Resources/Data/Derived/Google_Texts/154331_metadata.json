Ed Royce (R-CA) and Eliot Engel (D-NY) this week condemned the beheading of journalist Steven J. Sotloff and called for an international coalition to defeat the extremist group.\n\n\u201cSadly, ISIS is bringing this barbarity across the region \u2013 beheading and crucifying those who don\u2019t share their dark ideology,\" said Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cIf we don't disrupt and defeat it,\" warned Engel, the ranking Democrat on the committee, \u201c[ISIS] will attack homelands all over the world.\u201d\n\nFor all the outrage, two big questions remain: What precisely is the Obama administration prepared to do to contain or destroy the Islamic State, and will Congress grant the president all the war powers authority he wants or needs?\n\nObama began to outline his strategy at a press conference in Estonia Wednesday morning, en route to a NATO summit in Wales. Obama said that if the U.S. can enlist the support of the international community, \u201cwe can continue to shrink ISIL\u2019s sphere of influence, its effectiveness, its financing, its military capabilities to the point where it is a manageable problem,\u201d according to The New York Times and other media.\n\nRelated: What ISIS Really Wants (Besides Your Head)\n\n\u201cOur objective is clear, and that is: degrade and destroy ISIL so that it\u2019s no longer a threat, not just to Iraq but also to the region and to the United States,\u201d Obama said, using an alternative acronym for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel, meanwhile, told CNN in Newport, R.I., that the mission is specifically to \u201cdegrade and destroy the capability of ISIL to come after U.S. interests all over the world, and our allies.\u201d Hagel was vague on how great a threat ISIS poses to U.S. interests, particularly within U.S. territory, The National Journal noted.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of over 100 U.S. citizens who have U.S. passports who are fighting in the Middle East with ISIL forces,\u201d he said. \u201cThere may be more, we don\u2019t know.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there is a direct threat from ISIS right now to the homeland.\n\nIn Maine on Wednesday morning, Vice President Joe Biden gave a colorful explication of the country\u2019s aims with regard to ISIS. \u201cThe American people are so much stronger, so much more resolved than any enemy can fully understand,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a nation we are united and when people harm Americans we don\u2019t retreat, we don\u2019t forget. We take care of those who are grieving and when that\u2019s finished, they should know we will follow them to the gates of hell until they are brought to justice because hell is where they will reside.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Key to Solving Both ISIS and Russian Aggression\n\nObama, however, has repeatedly insisted that stepped-up and expanded air strikes against ISIS forces in Iraq or Syria would not mean a reintroduction of ground troops except to protect U.S. interests in those areas. Last week, he was clear that there would be no major escalation of the U.S. response to ISIS without Congress\u2019 involvement, which has been in recess since the end of July. During his interview, Hagel also said the president would seek congressional cooperation, saying he wants the \u201clegal authority\u201d to act against ISIS.\n\nDespite criticism of the president for failing to take stronger action already, some lawmakers argue that for both practical and political purposes, that is the best plan.\n\nLast weekend, Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK) urged the president to resist calls for immediate action, saying there is \u201ctoo much emphasis on acting now.\u201d Obama, he said, is right to wait for Congress to come up with a bipartisan plan. \u201cMake everybody put their fingerprints on this,\u201d Cole said.\n\nRep. Frank Wolf (R-VA) said Wednesday he would introduce the \u201cAuthorization for Use of Military Force against International Terrorism Act,\u201d giving the president broad authority to take action against terrorists. The bill would allow the president \u201cwith the close consultation, coordination, and cooperation with NATO and regional allies to use all necessary and appropriate force against those countries, organizations, or persons associated with or supporting terrorist groups.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Plays Long Game with ISIS and Ukraine\n\n\u201cFor far too long the Obama administration and the Congress have been debating whether or not authority exists for action to address this threat,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThis resolution would provide clear authority for the president and our military, working with coalition partners, to go after these terrorists.\u201d\n\nMichael O\u2019Hanlon, foreign policy expert with Brookings Institution, said Congress basically has two options for responding to the ISIS crisis in Iraq and Syria:\n\n1. Approve Obama\u2019s request for $500 million of supplemental funds to train and arm the moderate Free Syrian Army and use the measure to grant expanded authority.\n\n2. Debate and vote on major authorization legislation \u2013 along the lines of Wolf\u2019s bill \u2013 spelling out the administration\u2019s expanded role.\n\nThe administration submitted its request in late June, when the conflicts in Syria and Iraq became increasingly intertwined with the rapid growth of ISIS and its murderous drive to amass land in Iraq and Syria. Obama said his funding request was aimed at strengthening more moderate Syrian rebels.\n\nO\u2019Hanlon believes congressional action on the president\u2019s budget request would be the best and most expeditious way for Congress to respond. It would give the administration time to provide supporting documentation and witnesses to back up the request and spell out the mission.\n\nRelated: Releasing More Abu Ghraib Pics Would Help ISIS\n\n\u201cThe point is that if these things were explained as different pieces of a whole, my view is that the Congress would be essentially participating in the decision simply by approving that half billion dollars to the Syrian opposition,\u201d said O\u2019Hanlon.\n\nLawrence J. Korb, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and a senior adviser to the Center for Defense Information, has argued that the administration should seek separate authorization for any U.S. military action in Syria. \u201cI think Congress, if they approve the money for the Free Syrian Army, that does not include an all-out air war to support them. I think they should be separate votes,\u201d Korb said Tuesday on MSNBC.\n\nRelated: Obama Hammered on Ukraine, ISIS Delays\n\nHowever, debating and passing major authorization legislation will be difficult and time consuming. And with House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) eager to wrap up work well before the Nov. 4 election, Congress could end up signaling its views on ISIS in the supplemental defense spending bill.\n\nAsked whether he thought the beheadings would galvanize or motivate members coming back, Brookings\u2019 O\u2019Hanlon said, \u201cNot enough to fundamentally counter their skittishness. All of us are feeling outrage and disgust and sadness the first day. But everyone knows that if you get into a war like this you might implicate yourself in even more loss of American life. The beheadings are obviously significant and terrible, but I don\u2019t think they will be a game changer in and of itself. \u201c\n\nArguably the bluntest reaction came from Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, who was asked about the ISIS beheading at a veterans event in Chicago. \u201cWe should bomb the hell out of them,\u201d said the Republican lawmaker.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In very different ways, the president and vice president on Wednesday said the U.S. aims to destroy ISIS.
