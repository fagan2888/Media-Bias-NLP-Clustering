The last few years have brought home the fact that between the telecommunication companies, street surveillance cameras, tollbooth cameras and EZ-pass, and corporations such as Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook, virtually no aspect of our lives is immune from the intrusive watch of some agency of the state.\n\nThe usual response to this information is: \u201cI have nothing to hide. It doesn\u2019t matter if the state has my information.\u201d Critics like Glenn Greenwald point out one response, along the lines of \u201cOK, hand over your passwords to your email and bank accounts and credit card information.\u201d This is certainly right. This kind of information is crucial to the protection of your money, your private messages to others. Yet, it doesn\u2019t exhaust the other reasons why data collection and invasion of privacy is a problem about which many of us should be disturbed.\n\nAnother reason why privacy is important, as Greenwald and many others, including the philosopher Hannah Arendt, have argued, is that privacy is crucial to personal exploration, creativity, dissent \u2014 those interests and thoughts that reflect the complexity of human beings and their ability to flourish and lead meaningful lives. But as we also know, creativity and dissent can be disruptive to the smooth functioning of society \u2014 making the lives of bureaucrats and autocratic politicians much harder because their authority would be constantly challenged. As Professor Roger Berkowitz, Director of Bard College\u2019s Hannah Arendt Center, suggests in an excellent post on the importance of privacy for Hannah Arendt,\n\nSuch independent thinking is dangerous, or at least disturbing to the demands for conformity and correctness of public society. The real reason privacy is in decline today is because the very fruits of a rich private life \u2014 uniqueness, difference, and plurality \u2014 are scorned by the insistence on uniformity of opinion and behavior in good society. What suffers in the poverty of a meaningful private sphere is politics.\n\nLeading a meaningful life also, and often, means leading a complicated, unpredictable, undecipherable \u2014 but not necessarily a criminal or immoral life. I may be having an affair outside of my marriage \u2014 but why should this fact be up for scrutiny by the state or even my neighbors? Why should anyone else judge those actions except for myself and my marital partner (and maybe it\u2019s OK with him/her). How does my calling someone on the Pakistan/India border tell the NSA anything interesting about me \u2014 unless they are also making huge, overgeneralized judgments based on my ethnic and religious identity? Not only independent thinking, but unruly (read: brown, black, Muslim) appearances are also enough to rouse suspicion. Recently we saw this through the Intercept\u2019s story about the FBI and NSA surveillance of five prominent Muslims, from professors to Republican Party members, to the head of the Council on Islamic-American Relations (CAIR).\n\nBut spying isn\u2019t necessarily just about obtaining information. Surveillance is about gaining control. Collecting information on you \u2014 whether by the NSA, health insurance companies, the NYPD or a hacker \u2014 is an effort to predict your behavior and then to take steps to box it in, to stop you from acting in ways that are nonconforming (but not necessarily criminal), or to profit from your wayward behavior. We see this constantly: Credit reporting agencies collect all sorts of data about you \u2014 your spending habits, how many credit cards you have, how prompt you are in paying those bills, how many times you\u2019ve been late, what kind of disputes you\u2019ve had with other parties to whom you owe money. The official story for this kind of data accumulation is that they are attempting to assess what kind of credit risk you are. The problem with this is that their inferences about your behavior are often just plain wrong, if not dumb; having had a credit card dispute because I\u2019ve refused to pay a certain charge does not necessarily make me irresponsible. It might instead mean that I\u2019m likely to challenge charges that I think are unfair or wrong \u2014 which of course is a negative behavior in the eyes of a mortgage company or an employer (since we now know that employers regularly collect credit information about prospective employees) \u2014 the idea that I might challenge inaccuracies or unfairness might mean that I have an obstreperous personality that isn\u2019t actually conducive to the \u201cgo along and get along\u201d personalities that employers and mortgage companies value. So that means a higher mortgage interest rate for me.\n\nSimilarly, the NSA\u2019s collection of information about my online life \u2014 whether I\u2019m visiting the sites of fundamentalist imams or calling someone monthly who lives near the Pakistan/India border, is also an attempt to assess my politics and what kind of company I keep \u2014 in order to decide whether I am a so-called \u201cthreat\u201d to the national security of the United States. But surfing those websites or calling someone near the Pakistan/India border tells the NSA very little about my thinking process: For one thing, it\u2019s often difficult to know exactly why someone is doing something unless you can actually get inside their heads (Shhh, don\u2019t give the NSA any ideas). Maybe I\u2019m visiting the site because I\u2019m doing a report about Islam, or because I\u2019m skeptical about the news stories I come across that tell me that the imam whose sermons are on that site is a terrorist, or because I\u2019m looking for spiritual meaning. None of these mean that I will or want to become a terrorist \u2014 but they do mean that I am doing something that the state finds suspicious, or that they don\u2019t want me to do.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Government data collection is scary for many reasons.
