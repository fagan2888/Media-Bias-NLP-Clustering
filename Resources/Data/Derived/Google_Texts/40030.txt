The College of Charleston got a titanic early Christmas gift in the form of a 41-foot long Tyrannosaurus rex.

Students and members of the Geology department put together "Bucky" on Wednesday as a present to the college and the community.

According to school officials, Bucky weighs one ton, is 41 feet long, and stands 13 feet tall.

Bucky isn't composed of real bones but made out of a cast from a real Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton.

Officials said it took less than three hours to put Bucky together with about 10 people involved in the construction.

The dinosaur is on loan to the college for one year from the Indiana Children's Museum.

"He is on display in the lobby right outside the Mace Brown Museum of Natural History, located in the new Science and Mathematics Building, 202 Calhoun St." college officials said.

The building and the museum are closed for the holidays until Jan 5., but officials welcome people to take a sneak a peek through the windows.
