NJ Transit can increase its capacity by providing double-decker cars, lengthening trains, improving boarding procedures and turnaround times at Secaucus Junction, and installing new signs and equipment at the MetLife Stadium train station\n\nBuses would also be augmented, the newspaper reported. The No. 85 line in Hudson County, the 703 in Passaic County, and the No. 772 in Bergen County also would be expanded on game days during American Dream Meadowlands hours, the Record reported.\n\nAccording to the memo, the Turnpike Authority has agreed to pay for improvements at Interchange 16W and re-route traffic on the turnpike near the start and finish of games to the eastern spur to ease football related congestion on the western spur.\n\nTriple Five agreed to fund an increase in ramp capacity at various exits by upgrading pavement markings and adding signage at key locations that directs patrons to on-site parking or to off-site lots.\n\nThe 19-page memo stems from a 2012 lawsuit field by the Giants and Jets against Triple Five. The case was originally dismissed by Superior Court Judge Peter Doyne because the board of the sports authority \u2014 the landlord of the sports complex \u2014 had not approved the Triple Five plan. The teams refiled the case last summer after that approval was given.\n\nThe settlement was announced earlier this week.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\n\n\u2022 Jets, Giants agree to drop American Dream lawsuit\n\n\u2022 Giants and Jets go to court to stop American Dream project", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "David Giambusso/The Star-Ledger", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "'@jets','@river','american-dream-meadowlands','giants','meadowlands','nj-traffic','nj-transportation','nj-turnpike'", "title": "Traffic, transit improvements near Meadowlands key to American Dream deal", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Traffic, transit improvements near Meadowlands key to American Dream deal\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/nj_transit_nfl_triple_five_reach_meadowlands_traffic_deal.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.lehighvalleylive.com/home/lvlive-media/width620/img/breaking-news_impact/photo/12296460-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12437783\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-15T17:17:32Z\", \"author\": \"David Giambusso/The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@jets\",\"@river\",\"american-dream-meadowlands\",\"giants\",\"meadowlands\",\"nj-traffic\",\"nj-transportation\",\"nj-turnpike\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@njdotcom", "image": "http://media.lehighvalleylive.com/breaking-news_impact/photo/12296460-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "Increased trains, buses and turnpike improvements are at the heart of a settlement between entities at the Meadowlands.", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Giambusso"}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, December 08, 2014, 10:37 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.lehighvalleylive.com/breaking-news_impact/photo/american-dream-meadowlands-2a8aec990fc872bc.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dgiambus\", \"author_nickname\": \"David Giambusso/The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"5470\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Increased trains, buses and turnpike improvements are at the heart of a settlement between entities at the Meadowlands.", "title": "Traffic, transit improvements near Meadowlands key to American Dream deal", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/nj_transit_nfl_triple_five_reach_meadowlands_traffic_deal.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, March 15, 2014, 12:21 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Increased trains, buses and turnpike improvements are at the heart of a settlement between entities at the Meadowlands."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaea5\"", "article_summary": "RELATED COVERAGE\u2022 Jets, Giants agree to drop American Dream lawsuit\u2022 Giants and Jets go to court to stop American Dream project\n772 in Bergen County also would be expanded on game days during American Dream Meadowlands hours, the Record reported.\nThe 19-page memo stems from a 2012 lawsuit field by the Giants and Jets against Triple Five.\nEAST RUTHERFORD \u2014 After a dispute over potentially nightmarish traffic at the stalled American Dream project, NJ Transit, the Turnpike Authority, the Giants, the Jets and Triple Five \u2014 the American Dream project developer \u2014 hammered out an accord designed to ease congestion on game days at the adjacent Meadowlands Sports Complex, according to a report in The Record.\nThe memorandum of understanding between the parties, which was obtained by the newspaper, provides no compensation for teams and does not limit the hours of American Dream, but reconfigures traffic patterns, adds signage and buttresses train access to the site."}
