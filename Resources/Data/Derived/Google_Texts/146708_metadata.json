Without them, health insurance exchanges are likely to fill with people who need more care, increasing overall risks and sending insurance premiums higher.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, it may not be an easy sell to get the 75 percent of younger people who lack health care insurance according to a recent Gallup poll, to sign up for coverage. Some may bet they simply don\u2019t need health care coverage. Others may do the math and figure they\u2019d spend less on the federally mandated penalty for not having coverage.\n\nSo state and federal insurance officials are coming up with novel ways to get the message to their target audience. A group in Colorado, for instance, crafted an Internet-only ad campaign showing a college student doing a handstand on a keg of beer.\n\n\u201cKeg stands are crazy,\u201d the ad said. \u201cNot having health insurance is crazier.\u201d\n\nCover Oregon is now running ads with the same goal of attracting young people. In trying to show that health insurance is more affordable than many think, the tag line is, \u201cFor the cost of [a] $5 vanilla soy latte a day, you can get a sweet health insurance plan to match.\u201d\n\nRead the ruling and return to OregonLive to tell us what you think in this story's comment section.\n\n-- Dana Tims\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, cover oregon, politifact oregon, politifact oregon truth-o-meter, news", "title": "Can Cover Oregon insurance plans be purchased 'for the cost of a $5 vanilla soy latte a day'?
