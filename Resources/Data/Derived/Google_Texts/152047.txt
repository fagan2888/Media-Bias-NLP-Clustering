ANKENY, Iowa- Carly Fiorina Thursday brought her campaign to Ankeny’s Main Street Cafe and Bakery.

The former Hewlett-Packard CEO told the group she is calling for smaller government.

“The very act of repealing Obamacare,and rolling back these ridiculous regulations, that in and of itself unleashes productivity,” said Florina. “Ronald Reagan said a long time ago, but it’s still true,government is not the solution, government is the problem.”

Fiorina also brought her 6 point blueprint to show what she intends to do, as a way for citizens to hold her accountable.

Florin said she wants to bring technology into government for a common sense budget.

“That bill for zero based budgeting, press one for yes,.two for no,” said Florina.

“We use technology for foolish things like throwing people off of islands, voting for voices, I’m gonna use it for serious things,” said Florina. “We must restore a citizen government, it’s what we were intended to be.”

Fiorina made appearances in Ankeny and Marshalltown before heading to the GOP debate on FOX news in Des Moines.
