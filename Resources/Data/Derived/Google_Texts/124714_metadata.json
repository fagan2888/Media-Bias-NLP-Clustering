Funded by the government-run Indian Health Service (IHS), the conditions in these hospitals are proof of the racial disparities that exist in the nation\u2019s health care system, according to legislators and rights activists.\n\nIn 1978, well before Obamacare\u2019s inception, the United States government agreed to provide federally recognized American Indians and Alaska Natives with free health care. However, as this week\u2019s senate hearings exposed, the health care provided through IHS can be dangerous at best and deadly at worst. After visiting an IHS-funded hospital in Pine Ridge, S.D., inspectors with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they found various unsecured drugs, unlocked cupboards containing syringes and needles, and doctors who lacked proper credentials, the Rapid City Journal reported.\n\n\"What we've found is simply horrifying and unacceptable,\u201d said Senator John Barrasso (R-Wy.), chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, according to NBC News. \u201cIn my view, the information provided to this committee and witnessed first hand can be summed up in one word: Malpractice.\"\n\nPerhaps the most shocking story is about Debra Free, who died of a heart attack at Winnebago Hospital in Nebraska in 2011. She had reportedly been overmedicated by poorly-trained staff, none of whom were around to check up on her later in the night. She died on the hospital floor after falling from her bed.\n\nA major reason for these health care shortcomings is poor funding. In 2014, Mint Press News reported that IHS had only received $4.4 billion in annual funds from the federal government, when it really needs about $15 billion. NBC News more recently reported IHS has about half as much funding as it needs. Nearly 2.2 million of the nation\u2019s estimated 3.4 million American Indians and Alaska Natives receive care through IHS.\n\nThese issues with funding likely contribute to the racial disparities in health care we see today. According to IHS, Native Americans born today live an average 4.2 fewer years than any other racial group in the U.S. In part, this is because they\u2019re at a higher risk for diseases, such as chronic liver disease, type 2 diabetes, and chronic respiratory disease, as well as suicide and homicide.\n\nThe cause of these disparities goes deeper, however. A 2008 report from the Commonwealth Fund, a private nonpartisan foundation that researches health and social issues, found differences in income and education are significant predictors of health status and a person\u2019s ability to obtain high-quality health care. One of every four Native Americans lives in poverty. And as Mint Press News reported, 229 of the 566 reservations spread across the nation are in Alaska, in remote areas only accessible by airplane or boat. Seeing a doctor for one visit, let alone a follow-up, therefore becomes inconvenient and costly.\n\nThese health disparities have long been a point of contention between American Indians and their representatives and the federal government. With the senate hearing just passed, however, officials say they\u2019re ready to address the problem. \u201c[The IHS\u2019] federal obligation mandates that they promote healthy and safe Indian communities while honoring tribal governance,\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cThis is not happening.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "healthcare, native, american, reservations, horrifying, us, who, you, are, affects, how, youre", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A recent Senate hearing has exposed how underfunded and dangerous the government-run Indian Health Service really is.", "title": "Native Americans Are Getting Terrible Healthcare Services, But Are We Really Surprised?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/native-american-reservations-healthcare-terrible-372442", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/05/native-american_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A recent Senate hearing has exposed how underfunded and dangerous the government-run Indian Health Service really is.", "title": "Native Americans Are Getting Terrible Healthcare Services, But Are We Really Surprised?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/native-american-reservations-healthcare-terrible-372442", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/05/native-american_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/05/native-american_0.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2016-02-05T15:36:46-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-05T15:36:45-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A recent Senate hearing has exposed how underfunded and dangerous the government-run Indian Health Service really is."}, "article_summary": "The state of health care services on Native American reservations was divulged at a senate hearing on Wednesday, where eyewitnesses reported \u201chorrifying\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d conditions.\nThese health disparities have long been a point of contention between American Indians and their representatives and the federal government.\nIn 1978, well before Obamacare\u2019s inception, the United States government agreed to provide federally recognized American Indians and Alaska Natives with free health care.\nAccording to IHS, Native Americans born today live an average 4.2 fewer years than any other racial group in the U.S.\nNearly 2.2 million of the nation\u2019s estimated 3.4 million American Indians and Alaska Natives receive care through IHS."}
