A reporter then asked her the predictable question from a media that don\u2019t understand how a glitch in a rollout to a program that millions need won\u2019t have a huge impact in 2014.\n\nPelosi has no plans to hide from ObamaCare. Instead, she owned it as a pillar of security. You heard that correctly \u2014 a Democrat owning one of their policies that will benefit the people. It\u2019s a new day in politics.\n\nThe Democratic leader had clearly been waiting for someone to ask her this question about ObamaCare hurting Democrats in 2014. She beat the narrative to a pulp, and managed to claim the founding fathers while she was at it, \u201cThe affordable care act upholds the values of our founders\u2026 The legislation and the law is very strong, it sits right there as a pillar of security along with Medicare and Social Security.\u201d\n\nYes, that\u2019s right, the Speaker compared ObamaCare to two beloved safety nets, Social Security and Medicare \u2014 both of which the public won\u2019t let Republicans privatize/kill no matter how they frame it. Republicans are well aware that the people will really like ObamaCare if they get a taste of it, which is why they\u2019ve worked so hard to obstruct it, repeal it, delay it, and demonize it before 2014.\n\nPelosi continued explaining that the website glitch is a small piece of ObamaCare, \u201cIt\u2019s a small piece of a very big, transformative piece for our country that will succeed.\u201d\n\nThis attitude is the exact opposite of what Republicans were banking on for 2014. The entire Republican plan for 2014 was to run against ObamaCare. They thought they had Democrats on the run over the website glitch. Darrell Issa is still hoping to manufacture a few more witch hunts that will provide great sound bites for Republican ads, but the reality is that ObamaCare is a much needed program that should succeed.\n\nThe reality is that now that ObamaCare is here, and people have access to it, running on taking away access to affordable healthcare without an alternative is a really bad idea.\n\nNancy Pelosi is correct to boldly own ObamaCare and the positive change it will bring to millions, barring any huge problems. Republicans were hoping to force Democrats into running away from their biggest legislative success in years, but Nancy Pelosi isn\u2019t going to let that happen.\n\nPelosi threw down the ObamaCare gauntlet.
