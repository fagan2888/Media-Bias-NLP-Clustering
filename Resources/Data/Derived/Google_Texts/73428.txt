The 2014 Winnebago system sturgeon spearing season opened with 878 fish registered Saturday, including 636 on Lake Winnebago and 232 on the Upriver Lakes of Butte des Morts, Poygan and Winneconne.

The opening day harvest exceeded the entire 16-day season total last year (567 fish). This year features excellent ice and water clarity conditions; last year water clarity was poor.

The Department of Natural Resources reported 4,046 spearing shanties on Lake Winnebago and 380 on the Upriver Lakes.

The heaviest fish was a 143.9 pounder registered by William Zahringer at the Stockbridge Harbor station. The fish was 75.4 inches in length. Fifty of the fish registered Saturday were 100 pounds or more.

The systemwide harvest caps are the same as they have been the last two years - 400 juvenile females, 828 adult females and 1,200 males.

The DNR sold 11,823 licenses for the season, including 11,355 for Lake Winnebago and 468 for the Upriver Lakes. The licenses sales are down 6% from 2013 but fourth highest in history.

Spearers in 2013 registered 567 sturgeon for the entire season, including 261 on the Upriver Lakes.

The 2013 season featured fair ice conditions but poor water clarity and lasted the full 16 days on Lake Winnebago. Conditions are excellent for spearers this year, including 16 to 18 feet of visibility.

The fast pace of harvest means harvest caps will likely be reached in the next day or days on both the Upriver Lakes and Lake Winnebago, according to DNR sturgeon biologist Ryan Koenigs.

Bernice Young, 78, of Kaukauna was among the successful spearers Saturday. The photo below shows Bernice at the Stockbridge Harbor registration station; her fish is being carried by her son, Ron, 46.
