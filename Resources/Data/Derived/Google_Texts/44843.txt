New Denver psych-pop act Sunboy appeared on the scene last year with the fascinating and makeshift stop-motion video for “Highway Screamin’.” A dreamy summer day lost in a synth haze and a jaunty beat, the song and accompanying video quickly defined the band as one to watch for. Now, Sunboy will headline the Larimer Lounge on May 17 after playing opening spots on a few notable bills in the subsequent months. With a knack for hazy melodies and an affinity for tie-dye projectors, Sunboy joins the new age of psych music that has been made popular by Tame Impala and Unknown Mortal Orchestra. Wild High, Thanks for Everything and Male Blonding open the show. ($10, larimerlounge.com)

Leave it to Lana Del Rey to make her Colorado debut in the most Lana Del Rey way possible. The singer has always had panache in her short, bright career — especially when it comes to dominating headlines and conversation. And so it should only make sense that she’ll play her first Colorado show by headlining the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheatre on May 19. Del Rey’s 2012 album “Born to Die” dominated sales, becoming the fifth-best-selling album that year thanks to her somber, delightfully creepy persona. This year, she’s prepping the release of her new album, “Ultraviolence.” (Sold out)
