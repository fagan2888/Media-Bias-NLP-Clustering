(John Minchillo / Associated Press)\n\n\"Iran's nuclear military capabilities must be fully dismantled,\" he said.\n\nNetanyahu said that some criticism of Israel's policy is no more than anti-Semitism.\n\nWhen national leaders compare Israel to the Nazis, \"This is not a function of Israel's policies. It's a function of diseased minds and that disease has a name. It's called anti-Semitism.\"\n\n\"It is now spreading in polite society where it masquerades as legitimate criticism of Israel,\" he said.\n\nSeparately, Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns acknowledged Monday that negotiations between Iran and six world powers over Iran's nuclear program are at an especially difficult point.\n\nTo achieve ... peace, we must look not only to Jerusalem and Ramallah, but also to Cairo, to Amman, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh and elsewhere. \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\n\nAppearing at the Washington Institute on Near East Policy, Burns said that this year's talks are more difficult than last year's effort to reach an interim nuclear agreement.\n\n\"It's no secret that the negotiations are quite significant right now,\" he said. \"There are some quite significant gaps right now on the issues that are going to be critical\" in completing the deal.\n\nHe insisted, however, that it is still possible to reach a deal by the deadline of Nov. 24.\n\nThe world powers and Iran are seeking a deal that would lift economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for its taking steps to ensure that it won't gain bomb-making capability.\n\nSpecial correspondent Batsheva Sobelman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.\n\nFor foreign policy news, follow @richtpau", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Netanyahu calls on Arabs to take first step for peace", "date": "2014-09-29", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , in remarks to the United Nations General Assembly , said Monday that Arab nations should start working with Israel if they want to bring about an Israeli-Palestinian peace.", "title": "Netanyahu calls on Arabs to take first step for peace", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-netanyahu-arabs-peace-20140929-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5429d04e/turbine/la-fg-netanyahu-arabs-peace-20140929", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp09.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Netanyahu, Israel, Iran, Palestinians", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/81538031", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "Netanyahu, Israel, Iran, Palestinians", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in remarks to the United Nations General Assembly, said Monday that Arab nations should start working with Israel if they want to bring about an Israeli-Palestinian peace.
