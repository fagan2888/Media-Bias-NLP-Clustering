I mean, nothing that we\u2019re used to. Nothing that we would be expecting to see as the biggest drugs of abuse in Broward County for sure, but also throughout the country, and I\u2019ll show you\u2026\u201d\n\nSomewhere in that soup is Alpha PVP, or \u201cFlakka,\u201d a white powder that sent 40 Broward County victims to the morgue in the past 8 months and others running paranoid and naked down the streets.\n\nBroward Sheriff\u2019s executive director David Scharf:\n\n\u201cThe internal organs are actually melting as a result of this. The body is not able to flush these toxins out sufficiently, and what\u2019s happening is kidneys are failing and organs are failing and people are dying as a result of that.\u201d\n\nAt certain doses, Flakka creates a crystal meth like high and can be more addicting than cocaine, experts say. But the line between euphoria and so-called \u201cexcited delirium\u201d is razor thin.\n\nExcited delirium has caused victims to throw rocks through police department windows and impale themselves on fences. Adrenaline dumps give them super human strength. Untrained police could make a tragic mistake, Scharf says.\n\n\u201cSo the signs that we know and we see are going to be important for us to impart on these folks so that they don\u2019t make a mistake and shoot somebody.\u201d\n\nGadsden County Sheriff Morris Young says he invited his Broward counterparts to North Florida because he thinks the plague is spreading. Young says two deaths have been attributed to Flakka in Gadsden since June and emergency medical personnel are fielding five calls a day.\n\nIn South Georgia, Grady County Sheriff Harry Young says flakka is just beginning to rear its head. He says it\u2019s causing problems at the jail.\n\n\u201cIt seems like it\u2019s worse, really, as far as the attitude people have when they take this drug. It\u2019s hard to control them. Even when they come to jail. We have to put them aside, put them separate, because they\u2019re more violent.\u201d\n\nLeon County Sheriff\u2019s Sergeant Grady Jordan, a narcotics officer, says his unit has already arrested flakka dealers in drug stings. He says what\u2019s happening in Broward worried him enough to come to the seminar.\n\n\u201cHopefully with this type of training and education of our citizenry, we won\u2019t get to that level.\u201d\n\nThe good news, according to Broward County Sheriff\u2019s lieutenant Ozzie Tianga is that the trend might be slowing. The four hospitals tracking flakka-related admissions in Broward County report the number of daily admissions has fallen \u2013 from 11 to 9.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "With South Florida emergency rooms overflowing and body counts rising, the only way to halt an epidemic of the designer drug Flakka is education and", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/flakka-training-draws-500-north-florida", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201509/438971236.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "With South Florida emergency rooms overflowing and body counts rising, the only way to halt an epidemic of the designer drug Flakka is education and", "title": "Flakka Training Draws 500 To North Florida"}, "story_id": 438971204, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Jim Ash", "org_id": 390, "dc": {"title": "Flakka Training Draws 500 To North Florida"}, "nid": 11907, "datePublished": "2015-09-10", "keywords": "flakka", "wordCount": 634, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s the discouraging message Broward County Sheriff\u2019s officials brought Wednesday to the Florida Public Safety Institute in Havana.\nWith South Florida emergency rooms overflowing and body counts rising, the only way to halt an epidemic of the designer drug Flakka is education and community outreach.\nThe four hospitals tracking flakka-related admissions in Broward County report the number of daily admissions has fallen \u2013 from 11 to 9.\nBroward Sheriff\u2019s executive director David Scharf:\u201cThe internal organs are actually melting as a result of this.\n\u201cHopefully with this type of training and education of our citizenry, we won\u2019t get to that level.\u201dThe good news, according to Broward County Sheriff\u2019s lieutenant Ozzie Tianga is that the trend might be slowing."}
