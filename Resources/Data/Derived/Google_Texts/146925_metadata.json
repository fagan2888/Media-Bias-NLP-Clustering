As a professional psychic, there was a chance she\u2019d see the curve balls coming.\n\nHere, Gillies shares what she knew, and learned, about her fellow Real Housewives of Melbourne:\n\nHer big prediction? \u201cThis show is off the hook\u201d.\n\nGINA LIANO \u2014 BIG-HAIRED BARRISTER\n\n\u201cMy first thought was: \u2018Wow, Las Vegas s#@t\u2019,\u201d says Gillies of the barrister who boasts she hones her arm muscles backcombing her hair. \u201cShe\u2019s very bling, bling. I love bling bling.\n\n\u201cGina has this great talent for moving on. We have this rocky relationship where we get really cut with each other, but the next day we\u2019re having a laugh.\u201d\n\nANDREA MOSS \u2014 BOTOX IS HER BUSINESS\n\n\u201cMy initial feeling was Andrea was conservative and cliquey,\u201d says Gillies of the plastic surgery devotee who \u2018lives in Toorak, shops in Toorak and works in Toorak\u2019 \u2014 Melbourne\u2019s snobbiest suburb. But Gillies discovered that Moss and her plastic surgeon husband \u2014 as well as running a hugely successful beauty and plastic surgery business \u2014 are \u2018the most generous people you have ever met\u2019.\n\nCHYKA KEEBAUGH \u2014 BIG BUSINESS, SERIOUS CLOUT\n\nGillies\u2019 gut feeling that here was a woman who had it all together was spot on. \u201cChyka is the mother hen, the peacemaker, you can go to her for advice,\u201d Gillies says. \u201cShe started a business from scratch, and she just gets it. There\u2019s nothing to prove. Everyone calls her Switzerland, but she\u2019s not a fence-sitter. She just prefers not to get caught up in all the bulls@#t.\u201d\n\nLYDIA SHIAVELLO \u2014 THE (PRIVATE JET) FLYING FLYING MUM\n\n\u201cI felt she would be posh, saucy and a bit snobby,\u201d says Gillies of the interior design student woman who heads up a \u2018Brady Bunch\u2019 blended family. But she discovered despite the Porsche Carrera, the snow house in Thredbo, the exotic holidays, fast jet, fast car and fast husband, Lydia is \u2018one of the most down-to-earth women you will meet\u2019. \u201cShe\u2019s also as very sensitive.\u201d\n\nJACKIE GILLIES \u2014 PSYCHIC MRS SILVERCHAIR\n\n\u201cI am able to see people\u2019s past, present and future and read people,\u201d says Gillies. \u201cThe universe will always guide you, but so many people will not damn listen. I don\u2019t want to say I\u2019ve been given a gift, because I think every human is a bit psychic, but mine is clearer. There are people that don\u2019t believe and it\u2019s not my job to convince them. I wouldn\u2019t have done a show that was scripted. First, I\u2019m no actor. Second, you have to keep it real.\u201d\n\nJANET ROACH \u2014 POWERHOSUE PROPERTY DEVELOPER\n\n\u201cI met her and it was like \u2018this is my soul sister from a past life\u2019, I felt a strong connection, says Gillies of Roach, successful property developer, who is newly-single, and never washes her own hair. \u201cI love her to death. It\u2019s almost like Thelma and Louise. I have learned with all these ladies that no matter how much money you have, at the end of the day, we all have the same problems.\u201d\n\nTHE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF MELBOURNE, SUNDAY, 8.30PM, ARENA", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "description": "JACKIE Gillies felt like the new girl at school when she joined the cast of The Real Housewives of Melbourne.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "NewsComAu", "description": "JACKIE Gillies felt like the new girl at school when she joined the cast of The Real Housewives of Melbourne.", "title": "Jackie Gillies on Arena\u2019s Real Housewives of Melbourne", "url": "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/jackie-gillies-on-arenas-real-housewives-of-melbourne/story-e6frfmyi-1226834698907", "image": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2014/02/22/1226834/697260-414ed486-9b8f-11e3-a5ad-5f99c6c437b4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "image": {"src": "http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2014/02/22/1226834/697260-414ed486-9b8f-11e3-a5ad-5f99c6c437b4.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@newscomauHQ", "id": "@newscomauHQ"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "news.com.au", "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": "1533025129,653135158,737988273", "app_id": 113758722003364}, "articleid": 1226834698907, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "news.com.au", "google-site-verification": "GWTbDFKaKnGKyk3q0Na5jIbWHZ4qXn-ibcfMayjSQA0", "keywords": "plastic surgery devotee, mother hen, ,Las Vegas,Nevada,United States of America, ,Paddington,New South Wales,Australia, ,Toorak,Victoria,Australia, ,,,Switzerland, ,Woollahra,New South Wales,Australia, Lydia Shiavello, Real Housewives, plastic surgeon, Gillies stars, plastic surgery, profile businessmen, cultured lifestyle, skin care centre, Sydney Harbour, rock star, private jets, property developer, plastic surgery business, amazing homes, interior design student, psychic powers, plastic surgeon husband, design student woman, soul sister, reality franchise, gut feeling, curve balls, arm muscles, Liberty Belle, TV reality show, Jackie Gillies, Foxtel, Chyka Keebaugh, Arena, Janet Roach, Real Housewives of Melbourne, Andrea Moss, Gina Liano, Ben Gillies", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sat Feb 22 23:56:23 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sat Feb 22 23:56:23 EST 2014", "author": "Debbie Schipp Sunday TV Guide Editor"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "REAL HOUSEWIVES OF MELBOURNE CAST GET THEIR CLAWS OUTPOLL: REAL HOUSEWIVES AGAINST FAT TONY AND DOWNTON ABBEYGINA LIANO ON HER REAL HOUSEWIVES CAST MEMBERSGillies, wife of Silverchair drummer Ben Gillies was certainly rich, but new to Melbourne, and nobody on the social scene.\nVideoImage Real Housewives of Melbourne 1:29 Play video The Real Housewives of Melbourne will feature six new housewives who enjoy the lavish, pampered and cultured lifestyle who own private jets, amazing homes and are married to high profile businessmen, including one to a rock star and another to a plastic surgeonJACKIE Gillies felt like the new girl at school when she joined the cast of The Real Housewives of Melbourne.\nHere, Gillies shares what she knew, and learned, about her fellow Real Housewives of Melbourne:Her big prediction?\nThe Australian take on the hugely- successful US Real Housewives reality franchise had searched Melbourne for rich and powerful women, established on the city\u2019s social circuit.\n\u201cShe\u2019s also as very sensitive.\u201dJACKIE GILLIES \u2014 PSYCHIC MRS SILVERCHAIR\u201cI am able to see people\u2019s past, present and future and read people,\u201d says Gillies."}
