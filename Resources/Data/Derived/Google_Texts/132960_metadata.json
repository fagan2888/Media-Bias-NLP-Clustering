U.S. Government\n\nSpain\u2019s health ministry says the country documented its first case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) late this week in Madrid.\n\nA Moroccan-born Spanish resident was hospitalized in the capital city after visiting Saudi Arabia in October, where she was diagnosed with pneumonia. The woman is expected to recover from her illness and poses no threat to public health, the government said Thursday.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) also confirmed this week a second case from Saudi Arabia. A 56-year-old woman with underlying medical conditions died Oct. 30, several days after falling ill. Although reporting no exposure to animals possibly spreading the disease, she had contact with a patient previously diagnosed with MERS.\n\nMedical researchers in August said Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome may have spread from camels. U.S. Government\n\nSince last September, 64 people have died in a total of 150 cases of the emergent infectious disease, which may have spread by camels and other animals. Most patients infected by MERS-Cov \u2014 as the disease is known technically \u2014 have developed severe acute respiratory illness, with fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Thus far, infections have appeared only in countries linked to Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries. Although no infections have been reported in the United States, France has reported two cases and Italy one.\n\n\u201cBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all member states to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns,\u201d WHO officials said Thursday in a statement. \u201cHealthcare providers are advised to maintain vigilance.\u201d\n\nAny travelers from the Middle East developing severe acute respiratory infections should be tested for MERS, WHO advised. Moreover, hospitals and other healthcare facilities should exercise extreme care in preventing and controlling infections, given the highly contagious nature of the disease and possibility of transmitting infections to hospital workers.\n\nThus far, patients diagnosed with MERS have suffered respiratory disease as their primary illness. Other less common complications reported among patients are diarrhea, renal failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome with shock. However, WHO officials stress the possibility that immunocompromised patients might present doctors with atypical symptoms and signs of the disease.\n\nAlthough extremely dangerous, the disease remains rare. WHO officials told member states this week do not recommend special screenings for MERS at airports and borders, nor do they recommend placing travel or trade restrictions on Saudi Arabia and other Arabian Peninsula nations. \u201cThe conditions for a \u2018public health emergency of international concern\u2019 have not at present been met,\u201d officials said.\n\nOfficials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that the institution is continuing to investigate the emergent disease.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mers, middle eastern respiratory syndrome, saudi arabia mers, spain mers, severe acute respiratory infection", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The World Health Organization this week confirmed two more cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, including one in Spain.", "title": "Spain Confirms First MERS Case", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/spain-confirms-first-mers-case-world-health-organization-officials-recommend-vigilance-not-travel", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/09/who-mers-warrants-vigilance-no-travel-restrictions.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The World Health Organization this week confirmed two more cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, including one in Spain.", "title": "Spain Confirms First MERS Case", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/spain-confirms-first-mers-case-world-health-organization-officials-recommend-vigilance-not-travel", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/09/who-mers-warrants-vigilance-no-travel-restrictions.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/09/who-mers-warrants-vigilance-no-travel-restrictions.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-11-09T21:38:16-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-10T11:17:56-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The World Health Organization this week confirmed two more cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, including one in Spain."}, "article_summary": "The World Health Organization confirmed two more cases of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome this week, including one in Spain.\nU.S. GovernmentSpain\u2019s health ministry says the country documented its first case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) late this week in Madrid.\n\u201cHealthcare providers are advised to maintain vigilance.\u201dAny travelers from the Middle East developing severe acute respiratory infections should be tested for MERS, WHO advised.\nMedical researchers in August said Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome may have spread from camels.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) also confirmed this week a second case from Saudi Arabia."}
