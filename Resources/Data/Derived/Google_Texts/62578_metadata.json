I think the risk profile is essentially the same. I think we\u2019ve gone through all the work and I think that\u2019s a better product for the institution.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI think we\u2019ll get started very soon working on what the next steps are. With the interest-rate environment, I\u2019d like to get moving as fast as we can and progress on things.\u201d\n\nThe board\u2019s next regular meeting is in February.\n\n\u201cI would assume we would try and bring a plan of finance and a program plan (to that meeting), and I think we\u2019ll be able to meet that,\u201d Frank said.\n\nDuring the meeting, Frank went through the highlights of his assessment of the four options he laid out for study in October, after saying the publicly stated initial goal of raising half the stadium cost \u2014 or $110 million \u2014 by October hadn\u2019t been met. He argued that remaining in Hughes Stadium, whether through short-term \u201cmaintenance\u201d or a long-term commitment, was financially impractical.\n\nThen he got to the two options involving the new stadium \u2014 one the $195 million model and the other the $220 million plan. He reiterated that nothing viable had come out of discussions in building the higher-priced model as a public-private partnership, but made the case that it might be possible to go with the more ambitious model, anyway.\n\nHe told the board: \u201cI think that we can attain a CSU-owned and operated facility with minimal changes to the full scope as we look to the $220 million project,\u201d Frank said. \u201cI believe it meets the fiscal standard we have established. I believe it will have no impact on the general fund. And I believe that risk is more than adequately buffered by non-general fund resources and such a facility is in my opinion very much in the best long-term interests of the university.\u201d\n\nHe emphasized that the mandate would be to come up a \u201cfinancing option that meets (the) standard of minimizing impact to the general fund.\u201d\n\nIn the board\u2019s discussions, only Zimlich \u2014 who ultimately abstained \u2014 said he wouldn\u2019t support the motion.\n\n\u201cI continue to have signficant concerns about the risks that the students will bear an ultimate burden with the level of debt that we will put on the stadium,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve increasingly asked the students to pay more \u2014 higher tuition, higher fees. The citizens of the state of Colorado, when you talk about top issues they have, it\u2019s getting good jobs, the level of debt and its retirement. And the level of debt, when you talk to them about that, student debt pops up.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe added, \u201cTo me, the risk that we don\u2019t achieve the (revenue) projections and that the students will end up bearing the cost for this is a significant risk.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBoard chairman Dorothy Horrell said, \u201cI cannot stand the thought of just settling in anything we do. I\u2019ve come to believe that the risk of not doing this is greater than doing it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nearly five-hour meeting also included two hours of public comment.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/tfrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU board of governors approves football stadium plan", "title": "CSU board of governors approves football stadium plan", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/05/csu-board-of-governors-approves-football-stadium-plan/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141129__csu-hughes-stadium-1p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141129__csu-hughes-stadium-1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-05T16:58:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T09:11:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "Then he got to the two options involving the new stadium \u2014 one the $195 million model and the other the $220 million plan.\nThe resolution passed, in line with Frank\u2019s recommendation to the board, was to commit to building the stadium and authorize Frank to return to the board with a specific program plan and financing plan.\nThe Colorado State University system\u2019s board of governors Friday approved president Tony Frank\u2019s recommendation to move forward to build an on-campus stadium to replace the off-campus Hughes Stadium, which opened in 1968.\nHe told the board: \u201cI think that we can attain a CSU-owned and operated facility with minimal changes to the full scope as we look to the $220 million project,\u201d Frank said.\nFrank said it was \u201cvery likely\u201d a new stadium \u2014 and he and others emphasized it would be considered \u201cmulti-use\u201d for events other than football \u2014 could open for the 2017 football season."}
