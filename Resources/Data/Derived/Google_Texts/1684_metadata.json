His wife Chrysa has, like her parents, donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democrats in recent years.\n\nAngelo Tsakopoulos is \u201cabout as big as it gets\u201d in California Democratic politics, and was the fourth biggest donor in the 2008 election cycle, not far behind DreamWorks executive Jeffrey Katzenberg. He contributed $338,700 that year, 97 percent of which went to Democratic candidates, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nA \u201chuge source of cash for Democratic politicians,\u201d according to the Washington Post, Angelo Tsakopoulos served as the national chair of Greek-Americans for Bill Clinton during his 1992 and 1996 campaigns. He told the Greek Reporter last year that Hillary would run for president in 2016, per a conversation with Bill.\n\nThis is Demos\u2019 third attempt to garner the Republican nomination.\n\nIn the 2010 Republican primary he came in second with 31 percent of the vote, and in 2012 dropped out of the race, citing his imminent marriage to Chrysa Tsakopoulos.\n\nHe raised $543,640 in 2010 and $354,652 in 2012 before leaving the primary.\n\nDemos already has $2.1 million in the bank this year, thanks to two $1 million personal loans to his campaign. He has received roughly $200,000 in individual contributions.\n\nChrysa Tsakopoulos has donated over $200,000 to Democratic candidates and political action committees, according to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). She has contributed thousands to liberal Democrats, including Hillary Clinton and California Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein.\n\nOnly 2.7 percent of the $270,527 she donated between 2004 and 2011 went to Republican candidates.\n\nAngelo Tsakopoulos is the founder and owner of AKT Development, a real estate company that has helped the family\u2019s \u201cadmirers,\u201d the Pelosi\u2019s, make millions over the years. Tsakopoulos himself is worth an estimated $600 million.\n\nNancy Pelosi came under controversy in 2011 for not disclosing her husband Paul\u2019s business dealings with Mr. Tsakopoulos in her past financial disclosure forms. She failed to list an investment worth as much as $25 million, according to the Washington Times.\n\nPaul Pelosi had already earned between $1.4 million and $9 million from investments with Angelo Tsakopoulos since 1991.\n\nEleni Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis, Angelo Tsakopoulos\u2019s other daughter, is also well connected in Democratic circles, and close friend to Mrs. Pelosi.\n\nTsakopoulos-Kounalakis raised more than $1 million for Hillary Clinton during her 2008 primary battle with Barack Obama, and was named the U.S. Ambassador to Hungary in 2010, where she served until July 2013.\n\nThen-House Speaker Pelosi and her husband Paul sat in the front row for Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis\u2019 Senate confirmation hearing. \u201cMy husband and I are here as friends of the family and admirers of the Tsakopoulos-Kounalakis family,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s heard of the Reagan Democrat. George Demos is the world\u2019s first Pelosi Republican,\u201d David Laska, communications director for the New York Republican State Committee, told the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nLaska criticized Demos\u2019 campaign as taking \u201ctainted money\u201d from the Tsakopoulos family.\n\n\u201cThis is somebody who has been running for office consistently for four years, in a district in which he does not live,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when he fails catastrophically at gaining any real traction or support from either the Republican party or grassroots activists he decided he would try to buy his way into the Republican line with tainted money from his father-in-law, who is one of the most prolific donors to west-coast liberal interests in America.\u201d\n\nThe Demos campaign contends that he is an anti-establishment candidate. He received an endorsement in 2010 from conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who called the candidate a \u201cliteral Rush Baby.\u201d Limbaugh read a letter that Demos wrote to him in 1995, where Demos called himself an \u201c18-year-old private of the Dittohead reserves.\u201d\n\nLimbaugh described Demos as a \u201cconservative that the GOP power structure is trying to run out.\u201d\n\nNational Review\u2019s publisher Jack Fowler also praised Demos that year, saying, \u201cI like very much what I see\u2014on the issues he is all there.\u201d\n\nOn his campaign website, Demos lays out his positions as a pro-life conservative for \u201ccutting wasteful spending,\u201d \u201clowering taxes,\u201d and \u201cstrengthening national security.\u201d\n\nDemos had the support of the Tsakopoulos family in his previous races, receiving $9,600 for his first bid.\n\nHe received maximum $2,500 contributions from Angelo, Alexandra Tsakopoulos, Athena Tsakopoulos, Kyriakos Tsakopoulos, and Chrysa in 2012, totaling $12,500, which was refunded following his departure from the race, according to the FEC.\n\nDemos is running against State Sen. Lee Zeldin (R.) for the chance to challenge Democratic incumbent Tim Bishop, who has represented the district since 2003.\n\nWhen asked about his family ties by the Free Beacon, Demos\u2019 campaign spokesman instead criticized Zeldin, saying he is an \u201cestablishment\u201d candidate who supports Obamacare.\n\n\u201cSince Lee Zeldin got caught voting for Obamacare with the rest of the Albany crowd, his supporters are trying to say it was only a vote to allow federal money to pass through to the state,\u201d said Kevin Tschirhart, Demos\u2019 campaign manager. \u201cExactly. It allowed Obamacare to be funded in New York State.\u201d\n\nDemos is spending $30,000 a week to run television ads in Long Island that attempt to tie Zeldin to the president\u2019s health care law, according to the New York Daily News. Zeldin\u2019s campaign called the ad an \u201cirresponsible lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the way, the George Demos is running for Congress\u2014not his cousins, uncles, aunts, in laws, or wife,\u201d Tschirhart said.\n\n\u201cThe establishment is scared and ashamed of exposure,\u201d he added. \u201cTheir days are numbered.\u201d\n\nTschirhart did not address questions about Demos\u2019 connection to the Tsakopoulos family, his wife\u2019s donations to Democrats, or whether his in-laws have held fundraisers for the Demos campaign.\n\nThe primary is scheduled to take place on June 24.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u2018The world\u2019s first Pelosi-Republican\u2019", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "A Republican candidate for New York\u2019s first congressional district has close family ties to major Democratic donors, including the business partner of Paul Pelosi, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi", "title": "Republican Candidate for NY Seat Tied to Major Democratic Donors", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/politics/republican-candidate-for-ny-seat-tied-to-major-democratic-donors/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GeorgeDemos-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Republican candidate for New York\u2019s first congressional district has close family ties to major", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GeorgeDemos-150x150.jpg", "title": "Republican Candidate for NY Seat Tied to Major Democratic Donors", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b44\"", "article_summary": "George Demos is the world\u2019s first Pelosi Republican,\u201d David Laska, communications director for the New York Republican State Committee, told the Washington Free Beacon.\nShe failed to list an investment worth as much as $25 million, according to the Washington Times.\nLaska criticized Demos\u2019 campaign as taking \u201ctainted money\u201d from the Tsakopoulos family.\nAngelo Tsakopoulos is the founder and owner of AKT Development, a real estate company that has helped the family\u2019s \u201cadmirers,\u201d the Pelosi\u2019s, make millions over the years.\nPaul Pelosi had already earned between $1.4 million and $9 million from investments with Angelo Tsakopoulos since 1991."}
