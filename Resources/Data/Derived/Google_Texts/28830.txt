Letters to the editor (Photo: Gannett)

The presidential campaign has generated some shocking statements from the candidates.

Hillary Clinton announced that, in her opinion, unborn babies have no constitutional rights.

That is why in her mind, if you are pregnant, you can simply hire a medical doctor to abort and kill the unborn baby. Planned Parenthood can come in and dissect some of the baby’s parts and sell them for research.

Even prisoners on death row have constitutional rights and you could not, if you executed them, sell their parts without their consent. If you see a pregnant woman walking a dog, the unborn baby has no constitutional rights, but if you abuse that dog you can be arrested for cruelty to an animal.

Advocates for abortion call it “pro-choice.” It is an elective procedure not an emergency procedure to save a life. Nevertheless, the Obama administration through the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, will pay the abortionist, primarily through Planned Parenthood, to kill the unborn baby.

The Supreme Court no longer interprets the Constitution. It is a super legislature.

If Hillary Clinton is elected president of the United States, she will probably appoint Barack Obama to the Supreme Court and believe me, the last chance to reverse Roe v. Wade and save babies will be gone.
