Yet, he remains the leading Republican presidential contender.\n\nMany have tried to explain Trump\u2019s rise in the nine months since he entered the race, and now President Barack Obama can be counted among them: He offered up his analysis of Trump and the broader fight for the Republican presidential nomination during a speech Friday afternoon at a Democratic National Committee event at Texas\u2019s Austin Music Hall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a debate inside the other party that is fantasy and schoolyard taunts and selling stuff like it\u2019s the Home Shopping Network,\u201d he joked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nObama said he was unsurprised by the billionaire businessman and reality TV star\u2019s rise.\n\n\u201cHow can you be shocked?\u201d he asked to laughter from the crowd, according to a transcript. \u201cThis is the guy, remember, who was sure that I was born in Kenya - who just wouldn\u2019t let it go. And all this same Republican establishment, they weren\u2019t saying nothing. As long as it was directed at me, they were fine with it. They thought it was a hoot, wanted to get his endorsement. And then now, suddenly, we\u2019re shocked that there\u2019s gambling going on in this establishment.\u201d\n\nThe Republican Party set the conditions long ago for Trump\u2019s success, Obama said. The billionaire just capitalized on the GOP\u2019s own tactics, the president argued:\n\n\u201cWhat is happening in this primary is just a distillation of what\u2019s been happening inside their party for more than a decade. I mean, the reason that many of their voters are responding is because this is what\u2019s been fed through the messages they\u2019ve been sending for a long time - that you just make flat assertions that don\u2019t comport with the facts. That you just deny the evidence of science. That compromise is a betrayal. That the other side isn\u2019t simply wrong, or we just disagree, we want to take a different approach, but the other side is destroying the country, or treasonous. I mean, that\u2019s - look it up. That\u2019s what they\u2019ve been saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo they can\u2019t be surprised when somebody suddenly looks and says, you know what, I can do that even better. I can make stuff up better than that. I can be more outrageous than that. I can insult people even better than that. I can be even more uncivil. I mean, conservative outlets have been feeding their base constantly the notion that everything is a disaster, that everybody else is to blame, that Obamacare is destroying the country. And it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s true or not. It\u2019s not, we disagree with this program, we think we can do it better \u2014 it\u2019s, oh, this is a crisis!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo if you don\u2019t care about the facts, or the evidence, or civility, in general in making your arguments, you will end up with candidates who will say just about anything and do just about anything. And when your answer to every proposal that I make, or Democrats make is no, it means that you\u2019ve got to become more and more unreasonable because that\u2019s the only way you can say no to some pretty reasonable stuff. And then you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when your party ultimately has no ideas to offer at all.\u201d\n\nDespite his strong critique of the GOP, though, Obama added a caveat:\n\n\u201cThere are thoughtful conservatives \u2014 good people in the Republican Party, good people who are Republican voters who care about poverty and they care about climate, and don\u2019t resort to insults, and are troubled by what\u2019s happening inside their own party. I know them. I\u2019ve talked to them. But they\u2019ve got to acknowledge why this happened - because some of them have been writing that, \u2018Well, the reason our party is going crazy is because of Obama.\u2019 Which is a pretty novel idea. The notion is Obama drove us crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, the truth is, what they really mean is their reaction to me was crazy and now it has gotten out of hand. But that\u2019s different. I didn\u2019t cause the reaction. The reaction is something that they have to take responsibility for and then figure out how do we make an adjustment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Nation/World, Nation/World news, New Haven Nation/World news, CT Nation/World news, US Nation/World news, world Nation/World news.", "title": "Obama\u2019s brutal assessment of the rise of Donald Trump", "og": {"url": "http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20160312/obamas-brutal-assessment-of-the-rise-of-donald-trump", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20160312/NEWS/160319807/AR/0/AR-160319807.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1000px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Obama\u2019s brutal assessment of the rise of Donald Trump"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nhregister.com", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s ascendance is nothing if not surprising.", "title": "Obama\u2019s brutal assessment of the rise of Donald Trump", "url": "http://www.nhregister.com/general-news/20160312/obamas-brutal-assessment-of-the-rise-of-donald-trump", "image": {"src": "http://www.nhregister.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20160312/NEWS/160319807/AR/0/AR-160319807.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@nhregister", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id568468308", "iphone": "id520203861", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.newhavenregister"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 18506000}, "keywords": "Nation/World, Nation/World news, New Haven Nation/World news, CT Nation/World news, US Nation/World news, world Nation/World news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Donald Trump\u2019s ascendance is nothing if not surprising."}, "article_summary": "I mean, that\u2019s - look it up.\nAnd then now, suddenly, we\u2019re shocked that there\u2019s gambling going on in this establishment.\u201dThe Republican Party set the conditions long ago for Trump\u2019s success, Obama said.\nAdvertisementObama said he was unsurprised by the billionaire businessman and reality TV star\u2019s rise.\n\u201cThis is the guy, remember, who was sure that I was born in Kenya - who just wouldn\u2019t let it go.\nThe reaction is something that they have to take responsibility for and then figure out how do we make an adjustment.\u201d"}
