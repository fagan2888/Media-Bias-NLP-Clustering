REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS) - RTX155J1\n\n3984679\n\nThe bungled rollout of President Obama\u2019s signature health care law might have kept the president away from Gettysburg, but it has not kept him off the links or away from the fundraising circuit.\n\nSince the launch of the HealthCare.gov on October 1, Obama has gone golfing five times and attended ten fundraisers \u2014 with five more scheduled for the beginning of this week \u2014 while Obamacare\u2019s favorability has hit all time lows.\n\nAnd while President Obama\u2019s schedule has been open for golf and fundraisers, he was unable to attend the anniversary of the Gettysburg Address Tuesday due to \u2014 as White House advisor Dan Pfeiffer put it \u2014 \u201cthis whole website thing that someone suggested might destroy the Dem Party.\u201d\n\nThe problems affecting HealthCare.gov, however, did not stop Obama from golfing on Oct. 20, Oct. 27, Nov. 2, Nov. 9 or Nov. 17.\n\nFurther by the end of November, Obama will have attended some 15 fundraisers since the botched launch of HealthCare.gov on Oct. 1 \u2014 including the DNC\u2019s Women\u2019s Leadership Forum in D.C. on Oct. 24, two fundraisers in New York to benefit the DCCC and DNC on Oct. 25, a DCCC fundraiser in Boston on Oct. 30, two fundraisers for the DSCC in Dallas on Nov. 6, A DNC fundraiser and two DSCC fundraisers in Miami on Nov. 8 and a DCSS fundraiser in Philadelphia on Nov. 14.\n\nObama will also travel to Washington state and California early this week, where he will attend another five fundraisers.\n\nLast week the Guardian highlighted \u2014 as The Daily Caller did in May \u2014 that Obama\u2019s second term fundraising activities has vastly out paced those of his two-term predecessors, more than twice the rate of both former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.\n\n\u201cTravelling to the 30 fundraisers [since April], mostly held in private mansions and luxury hotels across 10 cities, has also required him to clock up more than 20,000 miles on Air Force One at an estimated cost to the US taxpayer of more than $6m,\u201d the Guardian reported on Nov. 12 \u2014 noting that Bush attended 11, Clinton 16, and Reagan 10 in that same time period during their respective second terms.\n\nOther news outlets have reported President Obama did pledge to raise money for the Democratic campaign committees, and is following through \u2014 despite the website and insurance cancellation notice threatening Obama\u2019s trustworthiness and signature legislation.\n\nFollow Caroline on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Caroline May", "description": "The bungled rollout of President Obama\u2019s signature health care law might have kept the president away from Gettysburg, but it has not kept Obama off the links", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "The bungled rollout of President Obama\u2019s signature health care law might have kept the president away from Gettysburg, but it has not kept him off the links or away from the fundraising circuit.", "title": "Obama makes room for fundraisers, golf in his schedule despite Obamacare troubles", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/24/obama-makes-room-for-fundraisers-golf-in-his-schedule-despite-obamacare-troubles/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/obama-wave-e1385323196260.jpg", "height": 252}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The bungled rollout of President Obama\u2019s signature health care law might have kept the president away from Gettysburg, but it has not kept him...", "title": "Obama makes room for fundraisers, golf in his schedule despite Obamacare troubles Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/11/24/obama-makes-room-for-fundraisers-golf-in-his-schedule-despite-obamacare-troubles/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/obama-wave-e1385323196260.jpg"}, "creator": "@c_maydc", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-24 22:10:08", "sailthru.title": "Obama makes room for fundraisers, golf in his schedule despite Obamacare troubles", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama,dnc,golf,obamacare,caroline-may", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "barack obama,dnc,golf,obamacare", "sailthru.description": "The bungled rollout of President Obama\u2019s signature health care law might have kept the president away from Gettysburg, but it has not kept him off the links or away from the fundraising circuit.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/obama-wave-e1385323196260.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb379\"", "article_summary": "Obama will also travel to Washington state and California early this week, where he will attend another five fundraisers.\nU.S. President Barack Obama waves as he departs the White House in Washington November 8, 2013.\nOther news outlets have reported President Obama did pledge to raise money for the Democratic campaign committees, and is following through \u2014 despite the website and insurance cancellation notice threatening Obama\u2019s trustworthiness and signature legislation.\nREUTERS/Kevin Lamarque (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS) - RTX155J13984679The bungled rollout of President Obama\u2019s signature health care law might have kept the president away from Gettysburg, but it has not kept him off the links or away from the fundraising circuit.\nObama is traveling to New Orleans and Miami today."}
