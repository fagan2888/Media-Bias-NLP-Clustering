This year, families have 41 options to choose from which can be a daunting task. Dr. Alicia Arnold sat down with an Affordable Care Act Navigator for advice on where to start.\n\nDr. Arnold asks, \"Can you tell us some of the benefits of the Affordable Care Act?\"\n\nAffordable Care Act Navigator says, \"For family of four to qualify for advanced premium tax credits which can lower their premium is $97,000. If they don't have coverage for 2016, when they do their taxes is 695 per uninsured adult, half that for children to a maximum of 2085.\"\n\nAlicia asks, \u201cDo you find that once people start looking into it, its not as difficult to get these plans as first thought?\u201d\n\nLane explains, \u201cThere's not a lot of information people have to enter anymore. Those aren't factored into the coverage, cost or anything anymore. Basically what you're entering in is your name address, birth dates of people in family and only sort of health related question is if you're a tobacco user.\"\n\nAlicia asks, hat would you suggest?\n\nLane responded by saying,\"The only people that can really give them advice as to which plan is best is health insurance agents who have been certified to help with the marketplace. That's really a good place to go and there's no charge for that.\"\n\nArnold says, \"What advice do you have for somebody already enrolled?\"\n\nLane says, \u201cMake sure income information is correct. 23:11:26 starting this year, the marketplace is taking their 2014 income and using that as a basis for tax credit for 2016. A lot of times people income changes a lot. With information in enrollment sessions that I'm having people can come and learn about the marketplace and learn about the marketplace and the tax subsidies. You have to enroll in the 15th of the month, in order for the coverage to start on the 1st of the following month. So Dec. 15 is a big date.\"\n\nAlicia asked, \"I there anything else you want people to know?\"\n\nSue says, \"Once open enrollment is closed, it doesn't mean people can't enroll in plans. Often times, people go through life events and make them eligible for special enrollment period.\"\n\nFree Informational Sessions\n\nLE Phillips Memorial Public Library\n\nMon Nov. 16\n\nThurs.
