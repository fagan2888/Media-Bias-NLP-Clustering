Besides sitting out the Medicaid expansion and refusing to set up a state-run marketplace for health insurance, Missouri has enacted some of the nation\u2019s toughest restrictions on \u201cnavigators,\u201d the community workers paid by the federal government to help consumers find affordable coverage.\n\nNow health advocates are calling the state\u2019s bluff. In a lawsuit filed in federal district court last week, physicians and community organizations claim that Missouri\u2019s \u201cHealth Insurance Marketplace Innovation Act of 2013\u201d violates both federal law and the U.S. Constitution.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the federal government trains, tests and certifies health care navigators. States can subject navigators to additional regulations, as long as the rules don\u2019t \u201cprevent the application\u201d of the health care law. The lawsuit claims Missouri crosses that line by restricting what navigators can say to consumers and limiting what the rest of us can say to each other. Some examples:\n\n\u25cf The Missouri law bars navigators from offering \u201cadvice concerning the benefits, terms, and features of a particular health plan.\u201d Yet their job, under federal law, is to help people find and choose the plans that are best for them.\n\n\u25cf Missouri prohibits navigators from talking about plans sold outside of the state\u2019s federally-operated insurance exchange\u2014yet the health care law requires them to \u201cprovide information about the full range of qualified health plans.\u201d\n\n\u25cf If a Missouri navigator meets a consumer whose current health plan was purchased through a private insurance broker, the navigator must refer the consumer back to the broker. Brokers are paid to push certain companies\u2019 products, but federal law requires navigators to provide \u201cimpartial information\u201d and \u201cact in the best interest of the applicant.\u201d\n\n\u25cf The Constitution bars lawmakers from regulating the content of speech, but the Missouri law effectively prohibits anyone from sharing advice about health insurance, even casually, without first getting licensed as a navigator.\n\nTwo of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit\u2014the St. Louis Effort for AIDS and Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region\u2014have been certified and licensed by the state. But the lawsuit claims the state is keeping them from performing their federally assigned roles. \u201cPlanned Parenthood has received numerous questions from individuals, including whether there are differences between the plans that are offered on the Exchange \u2026 and whether there are any products a person should consider off the Exchange,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cPlanned Parenthood believes that it cannot answer these questions because under [the Missouri law], it is not allowed to discuss the benefits, terms and features of health plans or to talk about products not offered on the Exchange.\u201d\n\nTwo other plaintiffs\u2014the Consumers Council of Missouri and Missouri Jobs with Justice\u2014say they can\u2019t even sustain their routine activities without running afoul of the state\u2019s onerous restrictions. Neither group employs official navigators, but both work to promote affordable health care and help people find it. \u201cConsumers Council believes that it cannot provide Missourians with information about enrollment because performing these duties could be performing \u2018service as a navigator,\u2019\u201d the complaint alleges, \u201cand thus the [council] could be penalized for doing so without a license.\u201d\n\nThe other plaintiffs\u2014two retired physicians, a social welfare advocate and a cerebral palsy patient named Chris Worth\u2014voice related concerns. \u201cChris Worth would like to make an educated choice about which plan to choose and believes that the health care attorneys in Paraquad [the advocacy group he works for] are best suited to give him advice,\u201d according to the lawsuit. \u201cWorth has not sought help from his colleagues for fear they could be penalized \u2026 for providing him advice.\u201d\n\nThe Missouri lawsuit is the first to challenge a navigator-suppression law, but it may not be the last. Health care attorney Jay Angoff\u2014the former Missouri insurance commissioner and HHS official who heads the plaintiffs\u2019 legal team\u2014has identified four states that bar navigators from comparing different health plans, and 10 states that penalize private citizens for helping each other find coverage. A ruling against one would invite challenges to the others.\n\nAnd recent experience suggests the Missouri law is vulnerable. Tennessee\u2019s insurance department imposed similar restrictions through \u201cemergency rules\u201d earlier this year, but it abandoned them this fall after health advocates filed state and federal lawsuits. In granting the Tennessee plaintiff\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order, U.S. District Judge Todd Campbell declared that the rules likely violated both the First Amendment and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe Missouri case could settle those questions for good.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Advocates challenge a Missouri statute that bars residents from discussing the \"terms and features of a particular health plan.\"", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/can-state-outlaw-health-care-advice", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Advocates challenge a Missouri statute that bars residents from discussing the \"terms and features of a particular health plan.\"", "title": "Can Missouri fine you for talking about health care?", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/can-state-outlaw-health-care-advice", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/articles/187991330.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/can-state-outlaw-health-care-advice", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/187991330.jpg?itok=RoNMlA1H", "height": 553}, "title": "Can Missouri fine you for talking about health care?", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Advocates challenge a Missouri statute that bars residents from discussing the \"terms and features of a particular health plan.\""}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-12-03T19:45:00-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "geoffreycowley", "tags": "health,health-care-reform,missouri,obamacare,republicans", "title": "Can Missouri fine you for talking about health care?", "published": 1, "date": "12/03/2013 19:45:00 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/can-state-outlaw-health-care-advice"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Advocates challenge a Missouri statute that bars residents from discussing the \"terms and features of a particular health plan.\"", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Republicans, Missouri, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c2d\"", "article_summary": "Under the Affordable Care Act, the federal government trains, tests and certifies health care navigators.\nStates can subject navigators to additional regulations, as long as the rules don\u2019t \u201cprevent the application\u201d of the health care law.\nNeither group employs official navigators, but both work to promote affordable health care and help people find it.\nAnd recent experience suggests the Missouri law is vulnerable.\n\u25cf Missouri prohibits navigators from talking about plans sold outside of the state\u2019s federally-operated insurance exchange\u2014yet the health care law requires them to \u201cprovide information about the full range of qualified health plans.\u201d\u25cf If a Missouri navigator meets a consumer whose current health plan was purchased through a private insurance broker, the navigator must refer the consumer back to the broker."}
