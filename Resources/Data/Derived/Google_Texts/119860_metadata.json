Her seven-year tenure as president lasted from 2004 to 2011, ending with a golden parachute: a $200,000 severance package. In 2010, she directed the institution in its $10 million purchase of 33 acres along the bank of Lake Champlain from the Roman Catholic Diocese. Fast forward to 2014, 25 acres have been re-sold for $7 million or a $3 million dollar loss to real estate developer Eric Farrell. This was a real boon to him, a failed hail Mary effort to keep the school\u2019s doors open. Those doors will close for good on May 27th, ironically just shy of Memorial Day, Monday. As past is prelude, the millennial teachable moment for the 2016 presidential election? Ruling progressive/socialists like Jane, Bernie \u2014 and Hillary \u2014 always personally live large. However, their Obama style big government policies always leave ruin in their wake.\n\nWhat was her grandiose, utopian plan? An empty pledge to double the student enrollment. How is that unrealized promise any different than her socialist hubby\u2019s of \u201cfree\u201d public college? Her pipe dream was to be a paradise: a beautiful new campus funded on borrowed money. What now remains? About 30 educators and staff out of work \u2014 and a lender making angry noises about potential fraud in the application filed by Mrs. Sanders. (\u201cJane, you got some splainin' to do!\u201d) Likewise is Bernie\u2019s absurd advocacy of a 90% tax rate and expanded government dependence programs that will add 18 trillion to the nation\u2019s already mammoth, and climbing, 19 trillion dollar debt. (Recall that 9 trillion of that has been added by Mr. Obama alone.) Yet, make no mistake, Burlington College\u2019s fate is a litmus test of Sanders' style failed leadership. Like wife, like husband, trust that that apple doesn\u2019t fall far from its tree!\n\nAs proof, anyone at the now bankrupt Burlington College can attest, the economics of socialism are inherently unsustainable. Britain\u2019s prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, famously said the real problem with socialist governments is that \u201cthey always run out of other people\u2019s money.\u201d Well, precisely. Socialists redistribute (think Obamacare). They steal from (capitalist) \u201cPeter\u201d to bribe (voter) \u201cPaul\u201d \u2014 and government they mismanage controls all! In a nutshell, that\u2019s the fascist Obama presidency. Specifically, consider coddled Michelle Obama\u2019s attitude of entitlement as her husband stoops to \u201clead\u201d us. Therefore, it is no surprise to any clear thinking person that job creators have been driven out of America (read: widespread corporate inversion). These hard leftist locusts rule and consume resources until there is no money left to beg, borrow or steal. Then, these characters perpetually claim hollow victories (fairness! equality!) and move on. All that is required is Mr. Obama\u2019s political optics. His formula: a few disconnected, cursory remarks, maybe a fly-in photo-op (read: Flint\u2019s water crisis) then onto those all-important waiting golf links. The end result is almost 8 chaotic years of anti-Americanism from every direction. Indeed, our society has been mangled \u2014 twisted backwards, upside down and inside out. Hence Black Lives Matter. So much for the hope in that change.\n\nExamples of progressive failures abound. Think of Maryland\u2019s \u201csinging cowboy,\u201d former governor Martin O'Malley\u2019s \u201cmillionaire\u2019s tax.\u201d (His \u201cflush tax\u201d and \u201crain tax\u201d are also real gems.) Of course there is the economic downturn perpetuated by continuous overspending with America\u2019s Chinese credit card, and tax-and-spend policies of the aforementioned Obama administration. Yet, let\u2019s cast the net even wider. Think of Venezuela\u2019s toilet paper shortage and two-day work week. Does Jane Sanders\u2019s failed leadership, \u201cthe crushing weight\u201d of debt incurred during her presidency, portend her husband\u2019s?\n\nJane was Burlington College\u2019s fourth president, but rest assured Bernie won\u2019t be America\u2019s 45th. That honor is likely reserved for his opposite counterpart, a blustering populist and plain-speaking pro-American capitalist who defies all political odds, and has galvanized the electorate. Someone who actually knows how keep the lights on, the doors open \u2014 and pay the bills.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-token": "0LEZ4Wu41CqPzmhsYEZm4oIo231IgbH6RYdNQthzgmg=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "Decisions made by Bernie Sanders&rsquo;s better half \u2014 his wife, Jane \u2014 have run a small Vermont private school Burlington College into the ground.
