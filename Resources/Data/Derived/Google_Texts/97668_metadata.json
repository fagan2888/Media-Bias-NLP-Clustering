How you speak to people matters.\n\nOne of the things that I will say and that I want \u2013 especially when we\u2019re talking about people, so thank you all for being here \u2013 is that, we have a tendency to turn people off right away, depending on what\u2019s being said. Some of that has nothing to do with what we say, it\u2019s the perception \u2013 you know, perception becomes reality \u2013 and if there\u2019s \u2013 if someone knows that you\u2019re a Republican, if someone knows I\u2019m a Republican, I many times don\u2019t even really talk about that, I just start having the conversation.\n\nAnd people, you know, especially young women, \u2018You\u2019re a Republican? I had no idea.\u201d Why? Because of how \u2013 yeah \u2013 how we are painted. And so, they\u2019re so surprised.\n\nWomen, by and large, agree with us on all of the issues. If you go through each issue, they agree. It\u2019s how we are able to articulate ourselves \u2013 make sure that we\u2019re getting the point across that we care, before we do anything else. That we relate to them, understand what every woman in this country is dealing with.\n\nEspecially moms, you know we balance so many different things, you know. Or school. Think about what many of you are doing, you know, you\u2019re trying to maintain that job, you know, you\u2019ve got to be moving up in your career. All these different things are coming in at the same time.\n\nMen do tend to talk about things on a much higher level. You know, one of the things that has always been one of my frustrations and I speak about this all the time \u2013 many of my male colleagues, when they go to the House floor, you know, they\u2019ve got some pie chart or graph behind them and they\u2019re talking about trillions of dollars and, you know, how the debt is awful and, you know, we all agree with that.\n\nBut by starting off that discussion that way, we\u2019ve already turned people away. Because it\u2019s like \u2018that doesn\u2019t affect my life, I don\u2019t understand how that affects my life.\u2019\n\nSo one of the things that we have worked with, with our male colleagues \u2013 and I have seen a difference, I will tell you I\u2019ve seen a difference \u2013 is to again, engaging individuals on their level. Talking about them on a personal level first. Making sure that when we speak to individuals, we\u2019re coming from the perspective that we care about what\u2019s happening in your life. We know that these things \u2013 that the agenda of the Obama administration, the Obama economy, has been hurting you and your family consistently. Obamacare is hurting your family.\n\nAnd then starting to talk about the solutions. One of the things \u2013 and you heard this from all of my colleagues \u2013 women are wanting commonsense solutions. Stop the \u2018no, no, no, we\u2019re against, we\u2019re against, we\u2019re against.\u2019 Tell us what you are for.\n\nThat\u2019s what women want to hear. Tell us how you\u2019re going to fix it.\n\nThe biggest need that women have is more time. We all want more time in our lives. More time in the morning to get ready. More time in the evening to spend time with our families. All of these things \u2013 more time to move up that career path. It\u2019s about time. And we have to make sure that women understand that we understand that.\n\nWe need our male colleagues to understand that if you can bring it down to a woman\u2019s level and what everything that she is balancing in her life \u2013 that\u2019s the way to go.\n\nAnd many of our male colleagues are starting something that I think is very important: Utilizing \u2013 especially when we\u2019re talking about the war on women \u2013 they are saying, you know \u2018I have a wife, I have daughters, I have a mother, I have sisters \u2013 if there\u2019s a war on women, I\u2019m losing it.\u2019\n\nYou know, I mean, basically \u2013 because they\u2019re saying \u2018these are the women that I go to, these are the women that I listen to, these are my \u2013 these are the folks that I need to talk to, these are the ones who direct my transactions.\u2019\n\nAnd when we talk \u2013 when our male colleagues talk about those things, those connections to women, they do much, much better job and women connect with them.\n\nYou know, exactly, it has to be consistent. It can\u2019t just be sporadic when we\u2019re talking about certain pieces of legislation or if there\u2019s an issue that arises and then we focus in on that. It has to be on an every day level, it has to be part of the discussion that our male colleagues have. It certainly is for us, you know, it\u2019s very easy for us to talk about the issues that are affecting women.\n\nYou know, one of the other issues, obviously, you know, some of the social issues, you know, many times, we know how the left, the media will try to trap one of our colleagues into a position, talking about what they\u2019re belief is especially if they know they\u2019re pro-life, right? Basically what we\u2019ve said to my friends, you know, I say: \u2018You know what? State your position. Where you are on this issue, when it comes to whether you\u2019re pro-life, pro-choice \u2013 wherever you are. And then you come out of that situation.\u2019\n\nBecause, one of the things that, especially women I think, are looking for right now is good leadership. And women may not necessarily agree with the position that you take, but they appreciate and they respect the fact that you have shared that with them and that they understand now where you stand on the issue. And there again, it\u2019s about leadership and unfortunately the lack of leadership here in Washington. If we can learn to be better leaders, and actually start looking and making sure [unintelligible] \u2013 for you, young people, that there\u2019s a vision for prosperity, that there\u2019s a vision for the country where we will be in a better place, I think that\u2019s another winning message, too.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Sunday, I wrote an article about the GOP's poor messaging on the \u201cwar on women\u201d narrative.
