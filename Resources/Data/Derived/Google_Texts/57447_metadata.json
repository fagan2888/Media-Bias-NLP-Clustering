The final batch is due at the end of this week, but on Friday, before the full fury of the storm was realized, the department asked a federal judge for a month\u2019s delay.\n\nThat delay would push the final email release \u2014 which is expected to include emails with high classification levels \u2014 to the end of February, after the first four states have voted in the Democratic presidential primary.\n\nHouse lawmakers, who were on a weeklong recess last week, were expected to be in session Monday through Wednesday this week, then off Thursday and Friday so Democrats could hold a retreat. But Mr. McCarthy\u2019s office said business is canceled through Wednesday because of the storm.\n\nArea airports were shut down Sunday, and returning to normal business is likely to take days. That means some lawmakers will struggle to get back to Washington.\n\nThe House was slated to vote to override President Obama\u2019s veto of a bill repealing key parts of his signature health care act, but that vote has now been pushed into February, as has a vote on an Iran sanctions bill.\n\nThe Senate, which was slated to convene Tuesday, has pushed back its first votes of the week until Wednesday evening.\n\nWashington doesn\u2019t always shut down for snowstorms. In 2009, Harry Reid, Nevada Democrat and Senate majority leader at the time, forced a weekend session in the middle of a storm to get the clock ticking on passage of Obamacare.\n\nThat storm shut down the region\u2019s subway system, but Mr. Reid, intent on getting the Affordable Care Act passed before Christmas, kept his troops at the Capitol. The bill cleared on Christmas Eve.\n\nThis year, with Capitol Hill leaders and Mr. Obama at odds on nearly every issue, little pressing business is likely to get accomplished, and all sides are looking ahead to the November elections.\n\nOn that score, Mrs. Clinton may catch a break if U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras accepts the State Department\u2019s request.\n\nThe last set of thousands of emails was slated to be released Jan. 29. It is the largest release yet and will complete production of more than 30,000 messages Mrs. Clinton sent on the email account tied to a server at her home in New York.\n\nThe release is likely to contain some of the most troublesome emails for Mrs. Clinton. Hundreds of her messages are deemed to contain classified information that officials say should have been sent only on a State.gov account.\n\nOn Friday, as the snowstorm was gearing up, the Obama administration requested a delay on behalf of the State Department, saying screeners were planning on working throughout the weekend but would no longer be able to do so because of the weather.\n\nThe State Department also acknowledged that it belatedly realized this month that it had a whole set of documents that other agencies needed to clear, but which officials never sent for review.\n\nThe department blamed Judge Contreras\u2019s strict schedule.\n\n\u201cState overlooked some necessary consultations at a time when the Clinton email team\u2019s efforts were focused on processing records that had already gone through interagency consultation in order to meet the monthly interim goals set in the scheduling order,\u201d the administration said in its court filing. \u201cThus, this oversight was not detected until the push to meet the final deadline.\u201d\n\nThe State Department said it has sent some of the documents to other agencies, but the storm disrupted that process, too.\n\nThe department said it hopes to have them delivered and returned, cleared, in order to be released Feb. 29.\n\nThat would mean the first four states in the Democratic presidential primary calendar \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina \u2014 would vote before the last and most controversial set of emails is made public.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House canceled all business for this week because of the snowstorm, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Sunday as the disruption of official Washington business looked to continue for some time.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The House canceled all business for this week because of the snowstorm, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Sunday as the disruption of official Washington business looked to continue for some time.", "title": "Hillary Clinton email release delay sought in wake of blizzard", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/24/hillary-clinton-email-release-delay-sought-in-wake/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/24/Clinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/24/Clinton.jpg", "description": "The House canceled all business for this week because of the snowstorm, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Sunday as the disruption of official Washington business looked to continue for some time.", "card": "summary", "title": "Hillary Clinton email release delay sought in wake of blizzard"}, "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Department Of State, United States Department Of State"}, "article_summary": "The State Department has blamed the storm for delays in finishing the release of former Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s emails.\nThe release is likely to contain some of the most troublesome emails for Mrs. Clinton.\nOn that score, Mrs. Clinton may catch a break if U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras accepts the State Department\u2019s request.\nThe department said it hopes to have them delivered and returned, cleared, in order to be released Feb. 29.\nThe Senate, which was slated to convene Tuesday, has pushed back its first votes of the week until Wednesday evening."}
