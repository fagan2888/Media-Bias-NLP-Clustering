Donald Trump on Friday blasted the Club for Growth for its ads in Utah attacking the Republican presidential front-runner for his support of universal healthcare, releasing a letter the organization sent him seeking a $1 million contribution the same month he kicked off his campaign last year.Trump said on Twitter:The tweet includes a letter — dated June 2, 2015 — from Club for Growth President David McIntosh, referencing a recent meeting with Trump in New York and saying, "that is why I am hoping you will consider making a most generous contribution of $1 million to the Club for Growth."This contribution would have a dramatically positive impact on the Club's ability to identify future free-enterprise champions," McIntosh continued. "I hope that I can count on your support."The organization's super PAC released the 30-second TV spot in Utah on Thursday, ripping Trump for his support for universal healthcare, tying his position to that of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton."Ask Donald Trump why he sides with Hillary Clinton, and why he wants more government health care," the spot says.In releasing the ad, McIntosh said in a statement: "Donald Trump has repeatedly reaffirmed his support for a health care mandate and for government-run healthcare, and the Club for Growth will continue to urge people to tell Trump that he’s wrong on this issue."Utah holds its presidential nominating caucuses on Tuesday.
