( Photo courtesy of Sara Anderson )\n\nA bad bout of pneumonia sent Bruce Anderson to Sutter Medical Center in Sacramento last May. As soon as he recovered, hospital staff tried to return him to the nursing home where he had been living for four years.\n\nAfter patient recovered from pneumonia, his nursing home refused to take him back.\n\nBut the home refused to readmit him, even after being ordered to do so by the state. Nearly nine months later, Anderson, 66, is still in the hospital.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m frustrated,\u201d said his daughter, Sara Anderson. \u201cYou cannot just dump someone in the hospital.\u201d\n\nAnderson said her father, who has a brain injury that causes dementia-like symptoms, is confined to the hospital bed and frequently given anti-psychotic medications. She believes the nursing home, Norwood Pines Alzheimer\u2019s Care Center, refused to readmit him because it wanted to make room for more lucrative and less burdensome residents.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have any question this was about money,\u201d she said.\n\nNursing home residents are entitled to hearings under federal law to determine whether they should be readmitted after hospitalization. The state Department of Health Care Services holds the administrative hearings, but has said it is not responsible for enforcing the rulings.\n\nBut the state Department of Public Health, which oversees nursing homes, neglects to enforce the rulings and sometimes disagrees with them, according to advocates and court documents.\n\nThat leaves residents like Anderson, who won his hearing in July, with little recourse \u2014 and not many places to go. And since many nursing home residents have publicly-funded insurance, it means taxpayers are on the hook for hospital stays long after the patients are ready for discharge.\n\n\u201cFederal and state law have created a complicated and expensive process to ensure residents are not abandoned by their nursing homes,\u201d said Tony Chicotel, a staff attorney at the nonprofit California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform. \u201cIt fundamentally doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nChicotel said the outcome is \u201cprofoundly problematic\u201d \u2014 vulnerable residents are abandoned by the nursing homes and then by the state.\n\nBruce Anderson, two other displaced nursing home residents and California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform are plaintiffs in a pending lawsuit against the California Health and Human Services agency.\n\nTheir suit, filed in federal court in San Francisco last November, alleges that the state is violating U.S. laws aimed at protecting nursing home residents from being \u201cdumped\u201d at hospitals. A hearing on the case is scheduled for next month.\n\nAttorney Matthew Borden, who is representing the plaintiffs, said he wants the federal court to require California to establish a hearing process that complies with federal law and to enforce the rulings.\n\n\u201cWe are not asking for the moon,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is the point of a hearing if no one is going to enforce it? \u2026 This illustrates how futile this process is.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state\u2019s Health and Human Services agency, which oversees both health departments involved, declined to comment, as did its attorneys at the California Department of Justice.\n\nThe defense lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the case, however, arguing that the plaintiffs haven\u2019t presented evidence of a \u201csystemic problem\u201d with regard to residents who are not readmitted to facilities after winning their administrative hearings.\n\nThe defense motion also lays out several ways in which state officials could enforce administrative hearing orders, including civil penalties against nursing homes. But Chicotel, of California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, said the state doesn\u2019t avail itself of the enforcement mechanisms.\n\nDeborah Pacyna, public affairs director of the California Association of Health Facilities, the trade association for nursing homes, said facilities can\u2019t always take residents back after hospitalization \u2014 even if the administrative ruling is in the resident\u2019s favor.\n\nFor example, nursing homes are prohibited by law from taking residents if they are dangers to themselves or others \u2014 or if the facility can\u2019t provide adequate care for them, Pacyna said.\n\nShe said Bruce Anderson did pose a danger \u2014 that he had assaulted a staff member and law enforcement officers. The nursing home said in the administrative hearing that it believed Anderson would be better off in a psychiatric facility, according to the ruling.\n\n\u201cThis is not about money,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about patient safety \u2026 The nursing home has to take into account the safety of the entire population.\u201d\n\nRegardless of motive, the refusal of nursing homes to readmit residents can put hospitals in a difficult situation. Patients can linger in the hospital for a year or more as staff members search for places that can accommodate their serious physical or behavioral needs, said Pat Blaisdell, vice president for the continuum of care at the California Hospital Association.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a major problem,\u201d she said, noting that on any given day there are a few hundred people in hospital beds around the state who shouldn\u2019t be there. That takes up valuable beds, staffing time and money that would be better spent on patients who genuinely need to be there.\n\nMedi-Cal pays hospitals about $400 a day for these patients \u2014 far less than what it takes to provide care for them, Blaisdell said. Nursing homes also receive meager reimbursement from Medi-Cal, which Blaisdell said she believes is likely a factor when they decide not to readmit residents.\n\nWhatever the reason, keeping patients hospitalized when they don\u2019t need to be is medically bad for them, she said.\n\nJohn Wilson, 61, is another one of the other plaintiffs in the lawsuit. He spent seven months at St. John\u2019s Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo after the hospital\u2019s parent company, which owns the skilled nursing unit where he had resided, refused to readmit him to it. Wilson has ALS, a degenerative neurological disorder commonly known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, and he needs a ventilator to breathe.\n\nWilson\u2019s son, Jeremy Wilson, said that in the past his father had gone to the hospital frequently for pneumonia, skin infections and other ailments, and each time the skilled nursing unit took him back. But last April, after Wilson got a bacterial infection and ended up in the intensive care unit, a social worker said he would not be accepted back into the nursing facility.\n\nThe family appealed the decision, and won its case in an administrative readmission hearing. But the facility still refused to readmit Wilson, his son said.\n\nJeremy Wilson said he was angry that the nursing home didn\u2019t comply with the order \u2014 and that the state didn\u2019t do anything about it. But after he pushed for months, the nursing home finally allowed his father to return, he said.\n\n\u201cHe was basically in a jail for seven months,\u201d the son said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t get in a wheelchair and go down into the garden. He was literally stuck in the room, and from a psychological standpoint, it took a great toll on him.\u201d\n\nSara Anderson said she is still trying to get her father out of Sutter Medical Center in Sacramento. She, too, sees the toll it is taking on him. He has grown weaker and he misses his home at Norwood Pines \u2014 and playing bingo with the other residents, she said.\n\nAnderson said the hospital staff is nice to him and he is receiving good care, but he really needs to be in a skilled nursing facility \u2014 not an acute care hospital.\n\nShe worries that it still may be a long time before her father is discharged, and that when he is, he will be sent someplace far from her home in San Joaquin County. Finding a place for him is very difficult, she said. \u201cPlaces do not want to take someone like him \u2026 He is a hard sell.\u201d\n\nBeyond her father\u2019s situation, Anderson said she wants the state to fix the way it handles nursing home readmission disputes. \u201cThis suit is really for the next family whose loved one gets dumped in the hospital,\u201d she said.\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After Bruce Anderson recovered from pneumonia, his nursing home refused to readmit him.
