Look, death comes for us all. In the words of the inimitable Dr. Cox from Scrubs\u2014\u201cEverything we do here\u2014everything\u2014is a stall. We\u2019re just trying to keep the game going, that\u2019s it.\u201d We\u2019ve gotten much better at stalling over the years (life expectancy in the United States has doubled since 1880), but there\u2019s still plenty of question as to how best to stall, for the longest amount of time, with the best results. In recent years, focus has increasingly shifted to offense rather than defense with the rise of \u201cpreventive medicine.\u201d Rather than doing our best to treat conditions once they arise, preventive medicine means getting out in front of the problems\u2014promoting healthy behavior, screening for diseases, trying to remove environmental and economic barriers to care. Preventive medicine was a key tenet of the Affordable Care Act, which created the National Prevention Strategy and a National Prevention, Health Promotion, and Public Health Council to implement it.\n\nBut how exactly can we catch diseases early, or, better yet, keep people from getting sick in the first place? How can we \u201cincrease the number of Americans who are healthy at every stage of life,\u201d as the National Prevention Strategy aims to? What strategies work? ANSWER The first step is to raise awareness. The public needs to be educated, prepared, and vigilant. Question How many people out there seem unaware of things like cancer, though? \u201cAwareness\u201d is a big buzzword in public health, and it\u2019s hard to argue against\u2014sure, it\u2019s probably good for people to be aware of diseases and health risk factors. But do these awareness campaigns\u2014the nearly 200 official U.S. \u201chealth awareness days\u201d and the scores of others put on by companies and organizations\u2014actually translate to any real-world action? Do they inspire people to eat better, exercise, or get tested? They may inspire people to donate to research or to advocacy organizations. And that\u2019s not nothing. But a literature review published last year in the American Journal of Public Health found that there haven\u2019t been many studies done evaluating the efficacy of awareness days, and the few that have been done weren\u2019t designed very well. One recent study analyzed the Great American Smokeout (an anti-smoking awareness day held on the third Thursday of November) and found that on the day, there were 61 percent more news stories about quitting smoking, 13 percent more tweets, 42 percent more calls to quitting hotlines, and 25 percent more quitting-related Google searches, than would be expected on a normal day. Questioning popular answers to pressing conundrums\n\nRead more So if the point is to get attention, that particular awareness day seems to be successful. But how many people actually quit smoking because of the Great American Smokeout? We don\u2019t know. There are cases where public awareness, or I might prefer to call them \u201cinformation campaigns,\u201d are totally needed\u2014in the case of emerging diseases for example, or ongoing outbreaks. During the Ebola outbreak, people needed to know how the disease was spread, how to protect themselves, and where to go to seek care. The current outbreak of Zika is a case where medical knowledge about the disease is still developing, and so updates on what we\u2019re learning are particularly valuable.\n\nBut awareness for the sake of awareness is a goal that seems, at least, questionable. ANSWER One concrete thing we can do is encourage people to get screened for diseases. If we catch them early, we can save lives. QUESTION Do the benefits of testing always outweigh the harms? At first blush, it\u2019s hard to see what the harms could be. You\u2019re being proactive about your health! You\u2019re giving doctors more time to treat and help you if they do find something. But false positives are a real danger with many kinds of screening tests, and they can lead not only to unnecessary stress and anxiety for a patient who is actually fine, but to invasive follow-up tests like biopsies. And for some cancers\u2014even if there is a tumor there, it may be one that\u2019s never likely to grow, that a patient can live with indefinitely with no ill effects. In his book on medical uncertainty, Snowball in a Blizzard, Steven Hatch, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, writes that false positives are more likely than false negatives, because humans are wired to look for patterns, and are also more likely to focus on possible threats. And using even a very accurate test on a population with lower risk for the disease can lead to more false positives, he writes. In recent years, several old trusty screening tests have come into question, and recommendations have been revised to advise using them less often. Mammograms for women under 50 are no longer recommended and neither is using the prostate-specific-antigen test to screen for prostate cancer. Women are supposed to get pap smears only once every three years instead of annually, and annual pelvic exams have also been deemed unnecessary for healthy women who aren\u2019t pregnant, by the American College of Physicians. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force studies and rates screening tests, giving them grades based on their likelihood of being beneficial. An A recommendation means there\u2019s high certainty of substantial benefit\u2014Hepatitis B screening for pregnant women and HIV screening are examples of A-level tests. Bs are for high certainty of moderate benefit or moderate certainty of high benefit; B tests include depression screening and mammograms for women 50 to 74. Cs are for moderate certainty of a small benefit (like mammograms for women 40 to 50), Ds are for moderate or high certainty that there are no benefits, or that the harms outweigh the benefits (like PSA prostate screenings).", "article_metadata": {"description": "The ups and downs of preventive medicine", "author": "Julie Beck", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The ups and downs of preventive medicine", "title": "How Can We Stop Disease Before It Starts?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/04/Health_AQ_1/facebook.jpg?1460752177", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/04/how-can-we-stop-disease-before-it-starts/477402/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force studies and rates screening tests, giving them grades based on their likelihood of being beneficial.\nPreventive medicine was a key tenet of the Affordable Care Act, which created the National Prevention Strategy and a National Prevention, Health Promotion, and Public Health Council to implement it.\nBut do these awareness campaigns\u2014the nearly 200 official U.S. \u201chealth awareness days\u201d and the scores of others put on by companies and organizations\u2014actually translate to any real-world action?\nIn recent years, several old trusty screening tests have come into question, and recommendations have been revised to advise using them less often.\nAn A recommendation means there\u2019s high certainty of substantial benefit\u2014Hepatitis B screening for pregnant women and HIV screening are examples of A-level tests."}
