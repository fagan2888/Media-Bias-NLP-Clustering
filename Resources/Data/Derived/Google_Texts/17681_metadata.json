The young, charismatic senator from Florida was an establishment savior, the physical manifestation of their political vision for winning national elections by appealing to Hispanics and young voters. He\u2019d do so, they envisioned, without compromising on the party\u2019s core religious and business policies\u2014just immigration reform and Tea Party rhetoric. But immigration reform crashed and Rubio seemed unprepared to compete at the highest levels. His numbers have declined; he\u2019ll struggle to regain the trust of the establishment.\n\nSo far, Rubio and Jindal look like they\u2019re auditioning for the role of 2016\u2019s Tim Pawlenty\u2014a candidate the mainline establishment wished could take off, but someone who didn\u2019t have the chops to win either Iowa or New Hampshire, states where the Tea Party and moderates are at an advantage. Perhaps the most obvious alternative to Rubio is Jeb Bush. But it\u2019s unclear whether the \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d message still plays with Republican primary voters, let alone whether Bush will run.\n\nThere\u2019s another potentially unifying mainline conservative, though, and he lurks in Madison. Scott Walker, the battle-hardened governor of Wisconsin, is the candidate that the factional candidates should fear. Not only does he seem poised to run\u2014he released a book last week\u2014but he possesses the tools and positions necessary to unite the traditional Republican coalition and marginalize its discontents.\n\nWalker has the irreproachable conservative credentials necessary to appease the Tea Party, and he speaks the language of the religious right. But he has the tone, temperament, and record of a capable and responsible establishment figure. That, combined with Walker\u2019s record as a reformist union-buster, will appeal to the party\u2019s donor base and appease the influential business wing. Walker\u2019s experience as an effective but conservative blue state governor makes him a credible presidential candidate, not just a vessel for the conservative message. Equally important, his history of having faced down organized labor and beaten back a liberal recall effort is much more consistent with the sentiment of the modern Republican Party than Jeb Bush\u2019s compassionate conservatism. Altogether, Walker has the assets to build the broad establishment support necessary for the fundraising, media attention, and organization to win the nomination. He could be a voter or a donor\u2019s first choice, not just a compromise candidate.\n\nThe other mainline conservatives possess some of Walker\u2019s characteristics, but not all. He\u2019s more compelling and presidential, with more gravitas than Rubio or Jindal.\n\nTo a certain extent, Walker is benefitting from caution and obscurity. Last year, I could have easily written that \u201cRubio could be a voter or a donor\u2019s first choice, not just a compromise candidate.\u201d Perhaps Walker will disappoint, too. After all, Pawlenty shared Walker\u2019s impressive electoral record in competitive states, but apparently lacked the chops to pursue the presidency. There\u2019s no way to know whether Walker\u2019s prepared until he runs.\n\nBut even though Walker\u2019s political skills remain an open question, there are reasons why he might be a stronger candidate on paper. For one, he\u2019s a more experienced politician\u2014and the fact is that political skills and instincts are learned and honed under tough circumstances. By the time Walker\u2019s wins reelection\u2014which I expect\u2014he will have won three competitive statewide contests in a tilt-blue state, under three different circumstances. He will have done so while campaigning and governing as a conservative. There are very few politicians who can claim as much.\n\nIt\u2019s also easy to imagine Walker catching fire in Iowa. The language of the religious right comes naturally for Walker, who often begins his speeches by thanking God or his supporters for their prayers during the recall. And ultimately, the Iowa caucuses privilege the religious right more than the Tea Party or any other form of modern conservatism. According to the 2012 entrance polls, 57 percent of Republican Caucus goers were Evangelical Christians\u2014Rick Perry and Rick Santorum won a combined 46 percent of their vote, with Newt Gingrich and Michele Bachmann adding on another 20 percent. Sixty percent of 2008 Republican Iowa Caucus-goers were Evangelical Christians, and Huckabee won 46 percent of their vote.\n\nWalker won\u2019t campaign as a culture warrior, like Santorum or Mike Huckabee. But overt religiosity would give Walker a considerable edge over the typical mainline conservative, much as it did for George W. Bush. It would even give Walker an edge over an ultraconservative Tea Party candidate who doesn\u2019t speak the language of the religious right: It\u2019s not a coincidence that Huckabee and Santorum won Iowa, or that Santorum won Iowa\u2019s \u201cstrong Tea Party supporters\u201d by a 13-point margin. And Walker\u2019s status as a culture ally, not a culture warrior, would give him broader appeal throughout the party\u2014especially given his temperament and reformist pedigree. Unlike Huckabee and Santorum, he\u2019ll play outside of the South.\n\nWalker\u2019s Midwestern roots would also be helpful, and not just because he should play well in Iowa, which neighbors his home state. If Santorum or Gingrich had the organization necessary to compete for the nomination, they would have needed to win Midwestern states like Michigan and Ohio. Incredibly, both states were extremely close\u2014mainly because evangelicals represented between 42 and 49 percent of the electorate. Romney prevailed by racking up massive margins in metropolitan areas\u2014a blueprint Christie will likely need to follow. But Walker stands a real chance of competing with Christie, blow for blow, in the relatively moderate but still conservative Republican turf around Detroit, Cleveland, and Cincinnati, while winning the countryside by a large margin.\n\nOf course, Walker's not even assured of winning reelection. And Christie has a head start in the invisible primary. But on paper, Walker\u2019s a very credible candidate\u2014even a great one. Mainline conservatives with hesitations about Christie seem likely to give Walker a serious look. Ultimately, he\u2019d need to take advantage of that opportunity, and prove he\u2019s as strong in practice as he is in theory, by performing well in the debates, building a capable campaign, and building support in Iowa. But so far, there\u2019s no reason to think he can\u2019t. If he does, he\u2019ll be the Republican frontrunner.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misspelled Michele Bachmann's first name.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Unlike Chris Christie or Ted Cruz, Scott Walker can appeal to the entire party.", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Unlike Chris Christie or Ted Cruz, Scott Walker can appeal to the entire party.", "title": "Scott Walker Could Reunite the GOP", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/675c683dcbc466f0a45dbf2ac42c54ced34a4471.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/115768/scott-walker-real-2016-frontrunner-he-could-unite-gop", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/675c683dcbc466f0a45dbf2ac42c54ced34a4471.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "Scott Walker Could Reunite the GOP", "description": "Unlike Chris Christie or Ted Cruz, Scott Walker can appeal to the entire party.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newrepublic"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/675c683dcbc466f0a45dbf2ac42c54ced34a4471.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Scott Walker Could Reunite the GOP\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/115768/scott-walker-real-2016-frontrunner-he-could-unite-gop\",\"section\":\"Election 2016\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-01T23:30:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":115768,\"author\":\"Nate Cohn\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Election 2016\",\"Politics\",\"Scott Walker\",\"Ted Cruz\",\"Rand Paul\",\"Marco Rubio\",\"Chris Christie\",\"Jeb Bush\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Election 2016", "published_time": "2013-12-01"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "He\u2019d do so, they envisioned, without compromising on the party\u2019s core religious and business policies\u2014just immigration reform and Tea Party rhetoric.\nSixty percent of 2008 Republican Iowa Caucus-goers were Evangelical Christians, and Huckabee won 46 percent of their vote.\nWalker has the irreproachable conservative credentials necessary to appease the Tea Party, and he speaks the language of the religious right.\nAnd ultimately, the Iowa caucuses privilege the religious right more than the Tea Party or any other form of modern conservatism.\nScott Walker, the battle-hardened governor of Wisconsin, is the candidate that the factional candidates should fear."}
