At the time, criticism of Rep. Lamar Smith\u2019s (R-TX) proposal centered on the fact that it would have eliminated the diversity visa program that was included in a similar bill by Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA). Watson then accused Obama\u2019s policies of relying on \u201ctax-and-spend\u201d economics, while Republicans were focused on renewing \u201cthat entrepreneurial spirit that makes America great.\u201d\n\nWatson also avoided responding to criticism of the RNC\u2019s online mishap on Sunday, in which the party thanked Civil Rights activist Rosa Parks on Twitter \u201cfor ending racism,\u201d particularly former RNC chair Michael Steele\u2019s statement that it displayed the lack of \u201ca Black voice\u201d to filter out those kinds of messaging errors. Instead, Watson produced a statement he said the party sent before the errant Twitter post.\n\n\u201cTalking about a typo and a tweet, it\u2019s old news,\u201d Watson told Roberts.\n\nWatch Roberts\u2019 interview with Watson, as aired on Wednesday, below.\n\n[h/t Talking Points Memo]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Black-RNC-spokesperson-asks-what-Obama-has-done-for-Black-community-MSNBC-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Black Republican: What has Obama done for the Black community?"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc939d\"", "article_summary": "Black RNC spokesperson asks what Obama has done for Black community [MSNBC]A spokesperson for the Republican National Committee (RNC) deflected criticism over the party\u2019s public statement regarding Rosa Parks on Wednesday by trying to paint the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as a problem for the Black community, which he suggested has been ignored by President Barack Obama and his Democratic party.\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t the jobs act pass in the House?\u201d Roberts asked, alluding to the STEM Jobs Act, which was defeated in Sept. 2012 after failing to gain a two-thirds majority.\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re focused on, you know, trying to create jobs, private sector jobs, good-paying jobs, career-making jobs, I would ask, you know, what exactly has the President done for the black community?\u201d RNC Communications Director for Black Media Orlando Watson asked MSNBC host Thomas Roberts.\nInstead, Watson produced a statement he said the party sent before the errant Twitter post.\n\u201cTalking about a typo and a tweet, it\u2019s old news,\u201d Watson told Roberts."}
