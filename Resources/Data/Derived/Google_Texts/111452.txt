In news that may bring a quick smile to your face or have you cringe in horror, depending on how well you know snakes, a pregnant California mom rushed to her 4-year-old son’s rattlesnake bite and attempted to suck the venom out. Unfortunately, as Folsom resident Jaclyn Caramazza found out, that particular home remedy is nothing but movie magic.

As reported by FOX 40, the Caramazza family was out enjoying the scenery of their local bike trail when son Vinny accidentally stepped on a baby rattlesnake. Before long, Vinny’s leg swelled purple from the venom and the nine-month pregnant Jaclyn responded as best as she knew how. "Mama bear instinct in me decided to suck the venom because that’s what Bonanza does," Jaclyn told FOX 40. Suffice to say, taking advice from a 14 season-long TV western probably isn’t the most medically sound approach, not least of which because someone sucking out the venom may very well end up poisoning themselves as well.

As it turns out, there are much safer and more practical ways to deal with a snakebite. “Use your basic wound type stuff, soap and water, wash the area, keep it clean and call 911 immediately,” Chris Stoots of California Fish and Wildlife told FOX 40. Other basic pointers to avoid getting bitten in the first place are to come prepared with proper footwear and avoiding any sort of confrontation with a spotted snake. "Any type of boot or some type of leather, something good is going to protect your feet and ankle area, which is a common area for bites," Stoots said.

Luckily, both mom and son are perfectly fine after their ordeal, with Vinny receiving proper medical care and antivenoms soon after the bite. More than anything else, it seems their story will serve as a good cautionary tale for anyone else who tries to be the next snakebite expert.
