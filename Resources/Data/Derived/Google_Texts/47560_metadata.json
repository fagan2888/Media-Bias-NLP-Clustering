Given that, the law shouldn\u2019t force sex workers to put themselves in even greater jeopardy every time they turn a trick. But that\u2019s just what it does.\n\n\u201cThey prevent people engaged in a risky \u2014 but legal \u2014 activity from taking steps to protect themselves from the risks,\u201d McLachlin wrote. \u201cParliament has the power to regulate against nuisances, but not at the cost of the health, safety and lives of prostitutes.\u201d\n\nChief Justice Beverley McLachlin and her colleagues voted \u2014 unanimously \u2014 to strike down all three of Canada\u2019s major prostitution-related prohibitions as overbroad, grossly disproportionate and unconstitutional because they impose \u201cdangerous conditions\u201d on how workers operate and \u201cheighten the risks,\u201d violating the basic Charter right to security of the person.\n\nAfter Robert Pickton\u2019s grisly serial murders \u2014 he boasted of killing 49 prostitutes and other women in British Columbia \u2014 this well-reasoned, landmark ruling was to be expected, and welcomed. The only surprise was its strength and sweeping scope.\n\nPrime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservative government can\u2019t rag the puck much longer on Canada\u2019s antiquated sex trade laws. The laws put vulnerable workers needlessly at risk. Now, the Supreme Court has given Parliament a year to rewrite them, paying more attention to the safety of those in the sex trade.\n\nAs the Star\u2019s Tonda MacCharles reports, Parliament needs to redraft the Criminal Code\u2019s triple ban on brothels, on living off the avails of prostitution and on communicating for the purposes of prostitution. The court acknowledged that regulation is a \u201ccomplex and delicate matter.\u201d Even so, the law must take more cognizance of the practical safety issues facing those who \u201coften have little choice but to sell their bodies for money\u201d because they are financially desperate, for example, or have drug addictions.\n\nIf Ottawa doesn\u2019t act, prostitutes will be free a year from now to ply their trade, hire staff and freely screen clients.\n\nInevitably, this ruling has brought calls for Ottawa to recriminalize prostitution, rather than rewrite the law. But that is a counsel of folly. Recriminalization would be unenforceable, ineffective and unwise. It would further stigmatize sex workers rather than rehabilitate or protect them, and would push the trade deeper into the shadows, putting the vulnerable at greater risk. The better approach is to rewrite the law so that it passes constitutional muster.\n\nThis needn\u2019t mean that \u201canything goes\u201d on the streets of our cities and towns. Far from it. Ottawa could allow sex workers to operate out of brothels or homes where they can better protect themselves, for example. Many already do. It could fine-tune the ban on living off the avails in a way that maintains \u201cexploitive\u201d pimping as a crime but that also allows prostitutes to hire bodyguards and other staff. With those safeguards in place, Ottawa might find itself on stronger ground arguing, for example, that the ban on communicating in public about a proposed act of prostitution \u2014 street prostitution \u2014 is a reasonable restriction to prevent nuisance solicitation, drug trafficking and other problems.\n\nAs the Supreme Court pointed out, Parliament has flexibility in deciding where and how prostitution may be conducted. \u201cThe regulation of prostitution is a complex and delicate matter. It will be for Parliament, should it choose to do so, to devise a new approach, reflecting different elements of the existing regime.\u201d What matters is the overall impact of the laws.\n\nThe challenge for Ottawa is to get that right. Laws that perversely impose dangerous conditions on a legal activity don\u2019t deserve to be on the books.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The sex trade is a dangerous, exploitative reality that stirs controversy about human dignity and public safety.
