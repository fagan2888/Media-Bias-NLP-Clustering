Students Abbey Crain and Matt Ford have published a damning report alleging that the university\u2019s alumnae and leadership still prevent black women from joining the school\u2019s historically white sororities.\n\nOne account, relayed to the Crimson White by Alpha Gamma Delta member Melanie Gotz:\n\nBy any measure, this candidate was what most universities would consider a prime recruit for any organization, sorority or otherwise. She had a 4.3 GPA in high school, was salutatorian of her graduating class and comes from a family with deep roots in local and state public service and a direct link to The University of Alabama. The recruit, who asked to remain anonymous, seemed like the perfect sorority pledge on paper, yet didn\u2019t receive a bid from any of the 16 Panhellenic sororities during formal recruitment. Gotz and others said they know why: The recruit is black. She and at least one other black woman, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of personal safety, went through formal recruitment this year, but neither was offered a bid.\n\nAccording to Gotz, university alumnae, who must approve all of the sorority\u2019s recruits, denied the admission. \u201cYou know, I would say there were probably five people in the room that disagreed with everything that was being said,\u201d said Gotz. \u201cThe entire house wanted this girl to be in Alpha Gam. We were just powerless over the alums.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much longer is it going to take till we have a black girl in a sorority?\u201d Gotz asked. \u201cIt\u2019s been years, and it hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Students say that fifty years after the school desegrated, its sororities still haven't", "title": "Report says University of Alabama\u2019s white sororities keep black women out", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Students say that fifty years after the school desegrated, its sororities still haven't", "title": "Report says University of Alabama\u2019s white sororities keep black women out", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/11/report_says_university_of_alabamas_white_sororities_keep_black_women_out/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/AP100409127683-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Students say that fifty years after the school desegrated, its sororities still haven't", "title": "Report says University of Alabama\u2019s white sororities keep black women out", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/AP100409127683-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@prachigu", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Prachi Gupta", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, greek life, Racism, Segregation, Sororities, University of Alabama", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Students Abbey Crain and Matt Ford have published a damning report alleging that the university\u2019s alumnae and leadership still prevent black women from joining the school\u2019s historically white sororities.\nAccording to Gotz, university alumnae, who must approve all of the sorority\u2019s recruits, denied the admission.\nTopics: greek life, Racism, Segregation, Sororities, University of Alabama, NewsFifty years after The University of Alabama was desegregated, \u201cthe UA greek system is still almost completely divided along racial lines,\u201d reports UA\u2019s newspaper The Crimson White.\nWe were just powerless over the alums.\u201d\u201cHow much longer is it going to take till we have a black girl in a sorority?\u201d Gotz asked.\nGotz and others said they know why: The recruit is black."}
