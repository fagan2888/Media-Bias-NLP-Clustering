Neither program was welcomed with open arms.\n\nSocial security critics of the time likened the move to socialism, which was a very dirty word for many during that era. Robin Toner\u2019s 2007 New York Times article, \u201cNew Deal Debate For a New Era,\u201d which tackled health care while Obama was on the campaign trail, lobbying for the first term of his present job, points out an exchange on Capitol Hill as the idea of Social Security was taking form that Linn also highlights in her article.\n\n\u201cSenator Thomas Pryor Gore, Democrat of Oklahoma, put it bluntly when Frances Perkins, the secretary of labor, testified on Capitol Hill that year about President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s plan for a new program called Social Security.\u201d\n\n\u2018Isn\u2019t this socialism?\u2019 Senator Gore demanded. When Ms. Perkins denied it, he asked again: \u2018Isn\u2019t this a teeny-weeny bit of socialism?\u2019\u201d\n\nToday it may be hard to imagine \u201csocialism\u201d as an evil threat but, at the time, many politicians feared the systems being implemented in Western Europe would take hold in the U.S. And this was a bad move in their eyes. Healthcare was so daunting a task that Toner notes even \u201cHarry Truman tried but failed to deliver a national health insurance program.\u201d Of course Bill Clinton also failed to implement his healthcare plan. So, in that respect, that Obama has even gotten this far is a triumph, even if at this moment of government shutdowns and website mishaps it\u2019s hard to discern.\n\nTechnical difficulties, as Delaney emphasizes in his article, are not unique to Obamacare. Social security\u2019s difficulties seemed far more insurmountable at the time. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d writes Delaney. \u201cAfter Congress passed the Social Security Act in 1935, a nascent Social Security Board faced a daunting task: enrolling 26 million industrial workers in less than a year, and another 2.5 million each year after that. One major problem: A lot of people had the same name.\u201d\n\nFor many, that reality made Social Security impossible to implement. Alf Landon, the 1936 Republican presidential nominee whom F.D.R. defeated by a landslide, called social security a \u201ccruel hoax\u201d and \u201cfraud on the workingman.\u201d Eventually, as Nancy Altman documents in her 2005 book, The Battle for Social Security, that problem was solved by devising the numerical system that created Social Security numbers.\n\nWith that hurdle cleared, another one popped up. \u201cBut how to reach the workers?\u201d writes Delaney. Altman, whose book he quotes, explains that \u201c\u2018Letter carriers delivered applications for numbers, helped people fill out the forms, answered questions about the program, returned the forms to typing centers where the cards could be produced, delivered the cards to the workers, and transmitted the applications of workers together with their newly-assigned Social Security numbers to [headquarters in] Baltimore.\u2019\u201d\n\nLinn notes that Medicare was opposed by the American Medical Association, Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan. \u201cIn 1961,\u201d writes Linn, \u201cthe future president recorded a speech in which he painted a dark picture of a time in which doctors would be told by the government which patients they could see, and where.\n\nIf his listeners didn\u2019t oppose Medicare, he warned, the medical plan would be followed by \u2018other federal programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country.\u2019\u201d\n\nMuch like Dr. Ben Carson\u2019s ridiculous claim that Obamacare is \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\u201d Reagan argued that if Medicare was implemented \u201c. . . one of these days you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children, and our children\u2019s children, what it once was like in America when men were free.\u201d\n\nSo, in that respect, the Republicans are using an old script. Thankfully history seems to be in Obama\u2019s favor. If Social Security and Medicare made it all the way through to implementation, there is little reason to believe that the Affordable Care Act will not follow suit. And the reality is: it has to.\n\nIn her 2009 article for CNN.com, Theresa Tamkins wrote, \u201cBankruptcies due to medical bills increased by nearly 50 percent in a six-year period, from 46 percent in 2001 to 62 percent in 2007, and most of those who filed for bankruptcy were middle-class, well-educated homeowners, according to a report that will be published in the August issue of The American Journal of Medicine.\u201d\n\nThe situation is dire, as lead author of that article, Harvard\u2019s Steffie Woolhandler, M.D., told Tamkins, \u2018Unless you\u2019re a Warren Buffett or Bill Gates, you\u2019re one illness away from financial ruin in this country.\u2019 During his first presidential run, Obama said, in response to then Republican criticism, \u201cWe can start getting into an ideological argument about whether we\u2019re slipping into socialism, [b]ut as long as there are 9 million children in the United States of America with no health insurance, it is a betrayal of our ideals that we hold as Americans.\u201d\n\nAnd, today, glitches and all, Obamacare, despite Republican strong arm tactics, will prevail because, like social security and Medicare before it, the need is far greater than the opposition.", "article_metadata": {"description": "OPINION - As some Republicans gloat over the technical hiccups of the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, more popularly known as Obamacare, the glitches aren\u2019t exactly unprecedented...", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "theGrio", "description": "OPINION - As some Republicans gloat over the technical hiccups of the rollout of the Affordable Care Act, more popularly known as Obamacare, the glitches aren\u2019t exactly unprecedented...", "title": "Attention Obamacare haters: Social security didn\u2019t have a smooth rollout\u00a0either", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2979, "identifier": "http://i0.wp.com/thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/social-security-16x9.jpg?fit=2979%2C1676", "height": 1676}, "url": "http://thegrio.com/2013/10/24/attention-obamacare-haters-social-security-didnt-have-a-smooth-rollout-either/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1699887390250781, "pages": 75928194876}, "google-site-verification": "nGSqmdocNPXRMLRT9q_QAemkqyzj9W5Vd4tzA7hsksg", "keywords": "opinion, politics, barack obama, health care reform, medicare, obamacare, rollout, social security, socialism", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "tag": "Socialism", "published_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-24T14:31:33+00:00", "author": "http://thegrio.com/author/rondarochapenricethegrio/"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd947c\"", "article_summary": "defeated by a landslide, called social security a \u201ccruel hoax\u201d and \u201cfraud on the workingman.\u201d Eventually, as Nancy Altman documents in her 2005 book, The Battle for Social Security, that problem was solved by devising the numerical system that created Social Security numbers.\nAllison Linn, in her CNBC article, \u201cObamacare fight vs. birth of social security: Which was uglier?\u201d adds Medicare to the mix.\nOne major problem: A lot of people had the same name.\u201dFor many, that reality made Social Security impossible to implement.\n\u201cAfter Congress passed the Social Security Act in 1935, a nascent Social Security Board faced a daunting task: enrolling 26 million industrial workers in less than a year, and another 2.5 million each year after that.\nSocial security critics of the time likened the move to socialism, which was a very dirty word for many during that era."}
