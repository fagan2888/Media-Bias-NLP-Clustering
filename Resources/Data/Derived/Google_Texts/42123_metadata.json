It was found that flying snakes have the ability to glide across considerable distances by flattering out their bodies and positioning themselves in an S-shaped profile. The aerodynamics of the snakes while flying is similar to properties of flying saucers (UFOs).\n\nThe unique snake pattern of the flying snakes helps them get some extra airtime, suggested new research.\n\nStudy co-author Jake Socha, a biomechanics researcher at Virginia Tech, said, \"The shape is unusual. You never find this kind of shape in any other animal flyer; you don't find it in engineered flyers. We didn't know if that was a good shape to have\".\n\nChrysopelea paradisi, or Paradise Flying Snake, is a strange flying snake as it curls its tails around a tree branch over 50 feet above the ground before flinging upward in the air. Researchers at Virginia Tech University found that the Paradise Flying Snakes position themselves at 60 degree angle to the ground while flying. But by the time they land, they have enough lift to move almost horizontally.\n\nDr. Socha said that they probably use their flying ability to escape from predators or to travel fast between trees.\n\nBetter understanding of their aerodynamic may help in developing better flying machines in future. Micro-air vehicles are good example of them that can effectively travel in the air. Snake robots could also be created to help in disaster relief operations.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc9ac\"", "article_summary": "Chrysopelea paradisi, or Paradise Flying Snake, is a strange flying snake as it curls its tails around a tree branch over 50 feet above the ground before flinging upward in the air.\nIt was found that flying snakes have the ability to glide across considerable distances by flattering out their bodies and positioning themselves in an S-shaped profile.\nResearchers at Virginia Tech University found that the Paradise Flying Snakes position themselves at 60 degree angle to the ground while flying.\nThe unique snake pattern of the flying snakes helps them get some extra airtime, suggested new research.\nResearchers have unraveled the mystery behind the mechanism of flying snakes."}
