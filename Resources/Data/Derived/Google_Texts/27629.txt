Sioux Falls, SD

The undead will walk the streets of Sioux Falls Saturday, October 24, and you're invited to join the invasion.

The 10th Annual ZombieWalk features a full parade that starts at 5 p.m Saturday. Registration to participate begins at 11 a.m and ends at 4:30 p.m. Zombies must purchase an official button for $3 behind Skelly's Pub. You can get yourself "zombie-fied" with make-up at Vishnu Bunny or Skelly's Pub for $5.

The parade starts at Skelly's Pub at 130 S. Phillips Avenue and down Main Avenue, where it will end at the Coliseum at 5th and Main. This results in road closures starting at 9th Street and River Road to Main Avenue from 9th Street to 4th Street. Roads will open again at 7 p.m.

Proceeds from the event go to the Big Paws Canine Foundation and the Sioux Falls Roller Dollz.
