Earnest said the article also noted that Democrats somehow appeared to be obsessed with sex.\n\nThat assertion couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, the press secretary told reporters.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a rather amusing observation on their part because it\u2019s Republicans who have, for example, passed this HB2 law in North Carolina.
