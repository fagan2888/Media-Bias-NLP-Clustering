Those groups built the site using $3.9 million in federal grant money made available through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe information can be found at www.cahealthcarecompare.org.\n\n\u201cThe time for greater transparency for healthcare costs is long overdue,\u201d Jones said. \u201cConsumers have been in the dark about the price of medical services from one medical provider and facility to the next and certainly haven\u2019t had cost information paired with quality measures.\u201d\n\nTwo months ago, California and 44 other states received a failing grade in an annual report card that measures how much access patients have to actual prices for medical care.\n\nThe new online tool seeks to remedy that by offering the range of prices paid by health insurers for more than 100 medical procedures or conditions as well as the average cost by geographic area.\n\nPublishing the amounts actually paid to hospitals and other providers \u2014 rather than just the amount charged \u2014 is considered more useful. Insurers often pay just a fraction of billed charges, and a policyholder\u2019s share is derived from the lower, discounted rate.\n\nResearchers who helped develop the site say the information will be eye-opening to many patients.\n\nFor instance, the amount paid for a total knee replacement ranged from $18,493 to $47,399 in west Los Angeles County. The average out-of-pocket for an insured patient was $750, including co-pays and deductibles.\n\nFor that procedure, consumers also can see individual hospitals rated for quality on a scale of 1 to 5 for joint replacement surgeries.\n\n\u201cIn any region for any service, it is astonishing to see the price variation,\u201d said Dr. R. Adams Dudley, director of the UCSF Center for Healthcare Value and a key architect of the online tool. \u201cI think this is a big step forward. We're moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nConsumers could use the website to check whether the price they were quoted for a routine lab test or procedure is out of line with the average cost in their community. Armed with that information, a patient could shop around or negotiate for a lower fee.\n\nBut prices alone tell only part of the story, Dudley said. That's why the site also gives ratings on the quality of care, drawing on data from government sources and outside groups.\n\n\u201cWe really don't think people just want prices. Nobody wants the cheapest toilet paper, and nobody wants the cheapest healthcare,\u201d Dudley said. \u201cWe really want high value \u2014 taking price and quality information into account.\u201d\n\nResearchers said the data also show a wide variation on the quality of care that patients receive from different providers.\n\nDoris Peter, director of the health ratings center at Consumer Reports, said the shopping tool illustrates that a well-regarded hospital may excel in one area of care, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to other specialties.\n\nThere are some limitations to the information available on the site.\n\nDudley said people can't compare what different health plans pay for the same service or at a particular hospital or doctor's office. The pricing data are aggregated by an outside vendor, and health plans aren't listed by name.\n\nDudley said health insurers balked at making their specific information available on the state website, fearful that competitors would see the rates they negotiated with medical providers.\n\nInstead, people can click on a button that will take them to their health insurer's website for detailed cost estimates. One drawback is that only health plan members can access that information, and consumers can\u2019t check the information before buying a policy.\n\nThese issues have taken on greater importance as many employers try to control their healthcare costs by raising deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses for workers and their families.\n\nIndividuals buying Obamacare coverage in government exchanges also face annual deductibles of several thousand dollars to hold down their monthly premiums.\n\n\u201cThe need for this is even more acute than a few years ago,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have a functioning healthcare market where consumers don\u2019t have pricing information.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Consumers can check medical prices, quality scores on new state website", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Lifting some of the secrecy surrounding California healthcare, state officials unveiled a website where consumers can look up average prices for common medical procedures \u2014 as well as quality scores for providers.", "title": "Consumers can check medical prices, quality scores on new state website", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-health-prices-20150921-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55ff52d4/turbine/la-fi-health-prices-20150921", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp10.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "medical care, prices, Affordable Care Act, health costs", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/84476491", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-09-21", "Description": "Lifting some of the secrecy surrounding California healthcare, state officials unveiled a website where consumers can look up average prices for common medical procedures \u2014 as well as quality scores for providers.
