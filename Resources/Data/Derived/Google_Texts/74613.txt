Dianne Sandberg has become good at lying, an odd habit, she admits, for someone of her stature.

Sandberg is a wish-granter with the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

“I’ve learned to do it, mainly over the phone,” she said. “I don’t want to give away the surprise before it happens.”

Her unique talent was in demand again Friday as she met the Stoop family of Newbury Park: Joe and Jessica and their three children — Alicia, 7; Josef, who goes by Joe-Joe, 6; and Dominick, 4. Both Joe-Joe and Dominick have spinal muscular atrophy and use motorized wheelchairs.

It was Joe-Joe’s wish that got Sandberg and a group of wish-granters involved in a two-month process to provide the Stoops with a toy-hauler RV, purchased by Make-A-Wish wish-granters and provided by Barber RV in Ventura.

“This is really going to give them some freedom to get out as a family and see the world,” said Sandberg. “I’ve got them thinking they’re coming here just to kind of see things and maybe check on a trailer hitch for their truck. I have to keep that illusion up until they get out here.”

Out in the sales lot, Barber RV employees were gathering. All of them had pitched in to donate accessories and items to go with the 23-foot Forest River Stealth toy hauler.

“We put in some things like fishing rods and a color television,” said Mike Arrambide, sales manager at Barber RV. The trailer has air-conditioning, leather seats, bunk beds, a queen bed and a full bathroom and shower.

“Joe-Joe’s into bugs too, and so we got him a bug collecting kit and some other things,” Arrambide said. “We’ve done this before. It’s the most heartfelt thing we can do. Joe-Joe wanted to be able to go to all the national parks and camp with his family, and in the van they have, they really couldn’t do that. Now they can.”

Mike Liang, park ranger with the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, was on hand to provide Joe-Joe with a lifetime pass to enter any of the national parks. He also gave him a series of photographs and videos made by rangers from 20 different parks, including the Statue of Liberty, Gettysburg, Denali and Joshua Tree.

“People with permanent disabilities get these lifetime passes from the parks,” said Liang. “We’ve always felt that the parks belong to everybody, but they primarily belong to children. It’s an incredible feeling to be involved in something like this.”

As Joe-Joe and his family came out the door, the staff of more than 30 Barber employees broke into applause and cheered. When the Stoops were presented the toy-hauler trailer and the keys to open and operate it, the parents cried and Joe-Joe was overwhelmed.

“I’m speechless, I’m just boggled,” said Joe Stoop, who works for Home Depot.

Joe-Joe and Dominick turned their chairs to go up the ramp and into the trailer. Joe-Joe smiled wide as he looked around.

“The first place we’ll go is San Diego,” his father said. “We’ll try it out. But then Joe-Joe wants to go the Badlands,” in South Dakota.

Joe-Joe’s mom, choking back tears, said she was overwhelmed.

“I had no idea this was going to happen,” she said. “I was waiting, hoping and praying.”

Then she turned and shouted out to the Make-A-Wish and Barber staff:

“You guys are so awesome!”
