That\u2019s about the same number as in the U.S., though Pakistan only has 180 million residents to the U.S.\u2019 313 million.\n\nWith a health care system in shambles and more young women getting the disease, breast cancer rates only are expected to get worse. World Health Organization official Shahzad Aalam in Pakistan said it was difficult to determine the exact magnitude, but that the disease is rampant.\n\n\u201cIt is the leading cancer killer among women,\u201d Aalam said.\n\nAmong Pakistani women there is very little knowledge about the disease. A study done at Rawalpindi General Hospital about breast cancer awareness among 600 women found nearly 70 percent totally ignorant of the disease, while 88 percent did not know about breast self-exams and 68 percent did not understand the significance of finding a lump in the breast.\n\n\u201cIf women are being diagnosed with breast cancer, they don\u2019t even share the news with their family members,\u201d said Omar Aftab, who heads PinkRibbon in Pakistan, which put on the university presentation where organizers couldn\u2019t even say \u201cbreast.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, we\u2019re trying to break these taboos,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother challenge is Pakistan\u2019s abysmal health care sector that is starved for money, the latest technology and drugs. Oncologist Saira Hasan at Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad said most major hospitals lack a screening center or mammogram facility. Many patients first go to a traditional healer and by the time they visit a reputable doctor, the disease is often too far advanced to treat, Hasan said.\n\nWomen in the developing world, like Pakistan, tend to die at greater rates than in more developed countries because the disease is generally detected later and health care options aren\u2019t as good.\n\nHasan said several factors have contributed to the rise in the disease \u2014 above all the cultural taboos.\n\nUnlike in the U.S. where celebrities like singer Sheryl Crow or actress Christina Applegate have freely discussed their fight with breast cancer, few such public figures have come forward in Pakistan. That\u2019s changed with Mirza, though she had to delay her treatment for three months after she was diagnosed in March 2012 to handle her work, which included how to rule on whether a criminal conviction against the serving prime minister should disqualify him from politics.\n\n\u201cThere was lot of pressure on me, work pressure,\u201d she said. \u201cEverybody (would) say it\u2019s an excuse I\u2019m using to run away.\u201d\n\nMirza described her friends and family being shocked by the diagnosis, as the cancer is considered by many as a death sentence. But during her diagnosis and treatment, she attended international conferences, ruled on the then-prime minister\u2019s case and later ran for re-election and won while undergoing chemotherapy.\n\nShe now uses her position in parliament to advocate for women\u2019s health issues. She plans to propose a bill making it mandatory for women to have breast cancer screenings and mammograms yearly, as well as to teach girls in schools to do breast exams themselves. She also pushed the health ministry to explain why there is no national database on breast cancer deaths.\n\n\u201cI think the role models will have to come forward,\u201d Mirza said. \u201cThat is one reason I had to.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe57d7\"", "article_summary": "With a health care system in shambles and more young women getting the disease, breast cancer rates only are expected to get worse.\nShe also pushed the health ministry to explain why there is no national database on breast cancer deaths.\nAnother challenge is Pakistan\u2019s abysmal health care sector that is starved for money, the latest technology and drugs.\nOne in nine women in Pakistan will face breast cancer during their life, with the country itself having the highest rate of the disease across Asia, according to the breast cancer awareness group PinkRibbon, oncologists and other aid groups.\nIn Pakistan, a country where breast cancer kills more women than terrorist attacks, an awareness group couldn\u2019t even say the word \u201cbreast\u201d while talking at a university about mammograms and how to check for lumps."}
