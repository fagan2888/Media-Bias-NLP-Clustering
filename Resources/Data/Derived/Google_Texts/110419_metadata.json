Photo of Mallott: David Dodman, KNOM.\n\nAlaska\u2019s three-way race for governor is now a two-ticket contest after Democratic candidate Byron Mallott and Independent Bill Walker declared late Monday, Sept. 1, they will be running together.\n\nTuesday, Sept. 2, is the last day for changes to the November general election ballot, and that deadline kept the Mallott and Walker campaigns negotiating late into Monday evening before announcing the two men will run together, Walker for governor and Mallott for lieutenant governor, on an independent ticket.\n\nIn a phone interview Monday night, Walker said the decision of who should ultimately be the one to seek the governorship under the \u201cunity\u201d ticket \u2014Mallott or Walker\u2014was simply driven by data.\n\n\u201cA head-to-head poll we took right after the primary had me about four or five points ahead of Governor Parnell,\u201d Walker said. \u201cSo, the numbers really drove that decision.\u201d\n\nThe decision was also endorsed by Mallott\u2019s democratic colleagues. The party\u2019s central committee voted 89 to 2 Monday night for the switch to an independent ticket. Mallott will drop his party\u2019s democratic nomination (despite an easy victory in last month\u2019s primary), and Walker will likewise forgo his past Republican affiliation. The two will appear on the \u201cAlaska First Unity Ticket,\u201d with the Democratic party pledging not to field another gubernatorial candidate.\n\nWith Mallott now running as lieutenant governor, the men who were hoping for that job\u2014Walker\u2019s running mate Craig Fleener and Hollis French, who won the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor to run alongside Mallott\u2014are resigning and stepping away from the campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very appreciative of their willingness to put Alaska\u2019s interests ahead of politics,\u201d Walker said. \u201cSo, we look forward to an administration that is non-partisan, not based upon one political persuasion or another.\u201d\n\nWalker said he\u2019s focusing on solutions to Alaska\u2019s high energy costs in his campaign, and pledged to challenge Governor Sean Parnell for what Walker called deficit spending.\n\n\u201c[Alaska] borrows about $7 million a day \u2026 from our savings account to stay afloat,\u201d Walker said. \u201cAnd we can do that for about five years. We will reach a point that, when we run out of savings, what then? So it really is this \u2018fiscal cliff\u2019 that\u2019s causing me concern.\u201d\n\nWalker said he and Mallott will also move to expand Medicaid\u2014the federal government\u2019s low-income healthcare program\u2014something Gov. Parnell opted out of leading up to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s launch last November.\n\n\u201cAlaska needs to accept expanded Medicaid,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cAlaskans have paid for it, 10,000 to 40,000 Alaskans benefit from it, it brings down the cost of healthcare, and it creates 4,000 new healthcare jobs in Alaska. So, I will accept expanded Medicaid.\u201d\n\nWalker added a caveat to that pledge: he said he\u2019ll only accept the Medicaid expansion if the federal government holds to its funding promises.\n\nAlaska voters summarily rejected a recent ballot initiative on oil taxes, which cements Gov. Parnell\u2019s oil tax system (known as MAPA) in the state\u2019s tax code. Despite Mallott and Walker both being confirmed opponents of Parnell\u2019s MAPA tax, Walker said, if elected, he would abide the will of the voters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going into this to spend our time in Juneau wrestling over this oil tax,\u201d Walker said, adding that he would focus on projects that get more oil in the pipeline.\n\nDespite agreement with both campaigns, the merged ticket is far from certain. Any changes to the November ballot must first be approved by the Lieutenant Governor\u2019s office. Just how the change at the Division of Elections will play out will be seen in the coming days.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "KNOM Radio Mission", "description": "Walker will run as governor, Mallott as lieutenant governor on the \u201cAlaska First Unity Ticket.\u201d", "title": "Walker, Mallott Unite to Seek Governorship on Independent Ticket", "url": "http://www.knom.org/wp/blog/2014/09/02/walker-mallott-unite-to-seek-governorship-on-independent-ticket/", "image": {"width": 1216, "identifier": "http://www.knom.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014-09-02-Walker-Mallott-Combined-1216px.jpg", "height": 812}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.knom.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2014-09-02-Walker-Mallott-Combined-1216px.jpg?w=640", "site": "@knom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.knom.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/cropped-KNOM-K-Logo-512px-square-270x270.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-02T20:27:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-04T17:47:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2907\"", "article_summary": "Walker, Mallott Unite to Seek Governorship on Independent TicketBill Walker (left) and Byron Mallott (right) teamed up in a \u201cunity\u201d governor/lieutenant bid.\nPhoto of Walker: \u201cWalker for Alaska\u201d campaign.\nIn a phone interview Monday night, Walker said the decision of who should ultimately be the one to seek the governorship under the \u201cunity\u201d ticket \u2014Mallott or Walker\u2014was simply driven by data.\nThe party\u2019s central committee voted 89 to 2 Monday night for the switch to an independent ticket.\nDespite Mallott and Walker both being confirmed opponents of Parnell\u2019s MAPA tax, Walker said, if elected, he would abide the will of the voters."}
