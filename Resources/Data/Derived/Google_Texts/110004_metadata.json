It\u2019s for everyone.\u201d\n\nKarim Benzema sealed Madrid\u2019s ninth straight win - and seventh consecutive clean sheet - in all competitions in the 74th, moments after Ronaldo\u2019s deflected free kick clipped the crossbar.\n\nMadrid moved two points above Barcelona and Atletico Madrid before they play games on Sunday.\n\n\u201cMy team is playing perfectly in 2014,\u201d Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said. \u201cIt has balance between attack and defense. That\u2019s the key. We haven\u2019t won any silverware yet \u2026 but our games in 2014 have been perfect.\u201d\n\nAlso, Levante twice overcame one-goal deficits before Simao Mate scrambled in the 75th-minute winner to topple Sevilla 3-2 on the road, dealing the Andalusian side its first defeat in nine rounds.\n\nLevante goalkeeper Keylor Navas again proved to be among the best in Spain with multiple saves, while Sevilla midfielder Ivan Rakitic scored his 10th goal of the season after missing a penalty. Levante\u2019s Nikos Karabelas and Sevilla\u2019s Jairo Samperio were both shown red cards late.\n\nValladolid ended Villarreal\u2019s three-game winning run with a 1-0 victory at home courtesy of defender Jesus Rueda\u2019s 40th-minute header to provisionally escape the relegation zone.\n\nEspanyol\u2019s promising striker Jhon Cordoba scored from long range before earning a penalty to help draw 2-2 at Valencia as both teams stayed in the upper half of the table.\n\nMadrid\u2019s Gareth Bale was substituted at halftime after being kicked in the groin early on. Ancelotti said after the game Bale wasn\u2019t injured, just \u201cuncomfortable,\u201d and he expects his winger to be ready for the Copa del Rey match against Espanyol on Tuesday.\n\nThis was Madrid\u2019s first home game since Ronaldo won his second Ballon d\u2019Or on Jan. 13 when he ended Lionel Messi\u2019s four-year reign.\n\nMadrid fans greeted Ronaldo with an enormous mosaic stretching across a wide section of seating that read \u201cCR7\u201d - Ronaldo\u2019s nickname composed of his initials and shirt number. Ronaldo responded by lifting his award with one hand while waving to his supporters with the other. He then called his teammates and veteran stadium manager Agustin Herrerin to pose with him for photos.\n\nRonaldo scored his 32nd goal in 28 games overall this season after receiving a pass from Luka Modric, who has established himself as Ancelotti\u2019s most reliable midfielder both in attack and defense.\n\n\u201c(Modric\u2019s) biggest quality is his ability to make incisive passes,\u201d Ancelotti said. \u201cEarlier in the season we had less personality in our style.\u201d\n\nRonaldo turned with the ball, shuffled to his left, and slotted a left-footed strike inside the post before running to the end-line to bask in his second showering of applause for the day.\n\nGranada never threatened Madrid, while goalkeeper Roberto Fernandez denied Ronaldo\u2019s bicycle kick in first-half injury time and got low to save his shot in the 68th.\n\n\u201cWe showed too much fear,\u201d Roberto said. \u201cThey are so fast on the break and with three touches are in the box. We were too scared that they would catch us on the break if we advanced our midfielders. It\u2019s tough to stop them right now, and especially on their pitch.\u201d\n\nRonaldo also participated in Madrid\u2019s second goal when he worked a one-two passing combination to free Marcelo, who squared for Benzema to fire home.\n\nBarcelona hosts Malaga on Sunday while Atletico visits Rayo Vallecano.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cristiano Ronaldo paraded his Ballon d'Or trophy and scored his league-leading 22nd goal, helping Real Madrid to provisionally move top of the Spanish league with a 2-0 win over Granada on Saturday.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Cristiano Ronaldo paraded his Ballon d\u2019Or trophy and scored his league-leading 22nd goal, helping Real Madrid to provisionally move top of the Spanish league with a 2-0 win over Granada on Saturday.", "title": "Ronaldo parades Ballon d\u2019Or, scores in Madrid win", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/25/ronaldo-parades-ballon-dor-scores-in-madrid-win/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/25/98b5175488c7f003490f6a7067003ab9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/25/98b5175488c7f003490f6a7067003ab9.jpg", "description": "Cristiano Ronaldo paraded his Ballon d'Or trophy and scored his league-leading 22nd goal, helping Real Madrid to provisionally move top of the Spanish league with a 2-0 win over Granada on Saturday.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ronaldo parades Ballon d\u2019Or, scores in Madrid win"}, "Author": "JOSEPH WILSON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlo Ancelotti, Karim Benzema"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe11ff\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe Ballon d\u2019Or is for the equipment managers, the trainers \u2026 for all the people who work for Real Madrid.\nThis was Madrid\u2019s first home game since Ronaldo won his second Ballon d\u2019Or on Jan. 13 when he ended Lionel Messi\u2019s four-year reign.\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) - Cristiano Ronaldo paraded his Ballon d\u2019Or trophy and scored his league-leading 22nd goal, helping Real Madrid to provisionally move top of the Spanish league with a 2-0 win over Granada on Saturday.\nIt\u2019s tough to stop them right now, and especially on their pitch.\u201dRonaldo also participated in Madrid\u2019s second goal when he worked a one-two passing combination to free Marcelo, who squared for Benzema to fire home.\nMadrid moved two points above Barcelona and Atletico Madrid before they play games on Sunday."}
