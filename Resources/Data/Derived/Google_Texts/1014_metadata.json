Under the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, thousands of hospitals have had their Medicare reimbursement cut because of high rates of patients returning soon after their discharge.\n\n\u201cIn essence, it\u2019s a lot of bookkeeping tricks instead of a real effort to improve care,\u201d said David Himmelstein, who co-wrote the analysis with Steffi Woolhandler. \u201cThey\u2019re saving Medicare some money by shifting costs onto patients.\u201d Himmelstein and Woolhandler, professors of public health at City University of New York, have argued that Obamacare doesn\u2019t go far enough in reforming the health-care industry and support a single-payer system.\n\nFewer Returns\n\nWhile the rate of Medicare patients returning to hospitals within 30 days of discharge stayed relatively steady at about 19 percent from 2007 through 2011, it dropped to about 17.5 percent in 2013, according to government data. Reduced readmissions means patients get better treatment at lower cost, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The department didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe decline may also mean that hospitals are simply putting another label on returning patients, Himmelstein said. Observation stays doubled from 2006 through 2013, and about a third of the claimed decrease in admissions from 2010 to 2013 is due to an increase in observation stays, according to the study, which analyzed data released last year by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.\n\nAkin Demehin, senior associate director of policy for the American Hospital Association in Washington, said hospitals work hard to avoid readmissions and have had some success. Other analyses haven\u2019t found a link between falling readmissions and increased emergency visits or observation stays, he said.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, this blog post makes sweeping assertions of cause and effect based largely on high-level information on volumes of admissions, observation stays and emergency department visits,\u201d he said in an e-mail.\n\nObservation Stays\n\nMedicare classifies patients in observation stays as outpatients, even though they may spend days in a hospital room. Patients are responsible for about 20 percent of their hospital costs, and Medicare won\u2019t cover a subsequent stay in a physical therapy facility, as it does for regular hospital admissions.\n\nAbout three-fourths of U.S. hospitals will have their Medicare reimbursement rate cut next year because they\u2019ve exceeded limits on readmissions. The rule hurts safety-net hospitals that serve the poor especially hard, said Peter Pronovost, director of the Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cWe might treat a lung-disease patient who can\u2019t afford to buy an inhaler we prescribed,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the patient is readmitted, there might be a penalty to the hospital that doesn\u2019t reflect the quality of care.\u201d\n\nThe Obamacare rule should be changed to account for patients\u2019 socioeconomic status, Pronovost said.\n\nThe readmission measure is just one of many pay-for-performance ideas that have failed in health care, Himmelstein said.\n\n\u201cGet rid of it,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "John Lauerman", "news_keywords": "Health,Health,medicare,Hospitals", "parsely-section": "industries", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-27/lower-hospital-readmissions-a-mere-label-change-analysis-says", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "title": "Lower Hospital Readmissions a Mere Label Change, Analysis Says"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-27/lower-hospital-readmissions-a-mere-label-change-analysis-says", "site": "@business", "card": "summary", "title": "Lower Hospital Readmissions a Mere Label Change, Analysis Says"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "parsely-tags": "Health,Health,medicare,Hospitals,Region: Global,Page: article", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-title": "Lower Hospital Readmissions a Mere Label Change, Analysis Says", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "NTPFD3SYF01W01", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "parsely-author": "John Lauerman", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Health,Health,medicare,Hospitals", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-08-27T12:00:00.002Z", "date": "2015-08-27T12:00:00.002Z", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-27/lower-hospital-readmissions-a-mere-label-change-analysis-says"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9caa\"", "article_summary": "Observation StaysMedicare classifies patients in observation stays as outpatients, even though they may spend days in a hospital room.\nOther analyses haven\u2019t found a link between falling readmissions and increased emergency visits or observation stays, he said.\nThe decline may also mean that hospitals are simply putting another label on returning patients, Himmelstein said.\nReduced readmissions means patients get better treatment at lower cost, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\nMedicare, the government program for the elderly, has targeted readmissions as a way of improving hospital care."}
