They happened all the time.\n\n\u201cSometimes you would be called out to a fire in the early morning and you\u2019d find a naked firefighter chained to the truck. You\u2019d have to cut him free before you could get on the road.\n\n\u201cThe mob mentality in there was just out of control. And the senior offices did nothing about it.\u201d\n\nThe mob mentality in there was just out of control. And the senior offices did nothing about it\n\nThe former firefighter revealed the photographs after reading a report in last week\u2019s Sunday Telegraph into the case of another firefighter, Ron Moor, who was bullied, harassed and humiliated while working at the same fire station.\n\nMr Moor is suing Fire & Rescue NSW in the Supreme Court for more than $1 million in lost earnings. Mr Moor, who suffered a humiliating initiation ceremony in the late 1980s and ongoing physical and mental bullying from his workmates at Castlereagh Street, had a mental breakdown in 2007.\n\nSince Mr Moor\u2019s story appeared, another seven firefighters have contacted his legal firm, Turner Freeman Lawyers, seeking legal help for allegations of workplace abuse.\n\n\u201cThis behaviour was clearly systemic, leaving most of these victims scarred for life,\u201d solicitor Sally Gleeson said.\n\nIn 2010, a Sunday Telegraph investigation revealed a hidden culture of bizarre sexualised initiation ceremonies within the Fire Brigades including firefighters being sexually assaulted and branded with red-hot coat hangars.\n\nFire & Rescue Nsw Commissioner Greg Mullins said in a statement that if the organisation been made aware of the August 2002 incident, it would have been investigated and appropriate action taken.\n\nHe said Fire & Rescue NSW has spoken with the firefighter who advised that he did not suffer ongoing physical or psychological issues.\n\n\u201cBullying and harassment of any kind will not be tolerated in Fire & Rescue NSW.\n\n\u201cThe revelations of bullying and harassment made in 2010 helped us, as an organisation, face up to aspects of the past that we are not proud of and to eliminate bullying and harassment from the workplace.\n\nSince 2010, we have made significant progress in implementing measures to prevent workplace bullying and harassment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Disturbing images of a bastardisation ceremony have emerged for the first time, providing damning evidence of institutionalised workplace humiliation within the NSW fire brigade.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "DailyTelegraph", "description": "Disturbing images of a bastardisation ceremony have emerged for the first time, providing damning evidence of institutionalised workplace humiliation within the NSW fire brigade.", "title": "Firefighter shackled to the back of a truck in disturbing, brutal ritual", "url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/firefighter-shackled-to-the-back-of-a-truck-in-disturbing-brutal-ritual/story-fni0cx4q-1226921189777", "image": "http://resources.news.com.au/cs/dailytelegraph/images/placeholders/story-thumb-large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": {"identifier": "@dailytelegraph", "id": "@dailytelegraph"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135086289853833}, "articleid": 1226921189777, "keywords": "unreasonable order, mental bullying, cable ties, appropriate action, mental breakdown, official complaint, caustic oven, lost earnings, damning evidence, mob mentality, Disturbing images, sexualised initiation ceremonies, bizarre sexualised initiation, photo card, Supreme Court, soda ash, Greg Mullins, Sally Gleeson, senior officer, oven cleaner, humiliating initiation ceremony, fire hose, workplace humiliation, bastardisation ceremony, fire brigade, corrosive oven cleaner, fire station", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sun May 18 12:31:06 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sun May 18 12:31:06 EST 2014", "author": "JIM O\u2019ROURKE"}}, "article_summary": "The victim, who Fire & Rescue NSW management said did not make an official complaint, is now stationed in regional NSW.\nMr Moor is suing Fire & Rescue NSW in the Supreme Court for more than $1 million in lost earnings.\nHe said Fire & Rescue NSW has spoken with the firefighter who advised that he did not suffer ongoing physical or psychological issues.\nFirefighter shackled to the back of a truck in disturbing, brutal ritualDisturbing images of a bastardisation ceremony have emerged for the first time, providing damning evidence of institutionalised workplace humiliation within the NSW fire brigade.\nSince 2010, we have made significant progress in implementing measures to prevent workplace bullying and harassment.\u201d"}
