Broadening ownership and boosting workers\u2019 share of capital through retirement savings helps strengthen the economy and create jobs. That\u2019s why we, together with six of our House Ways and Means Committee colleagues, have again introduced the Promotion and Expansion of Private Employee Ownership Act of 2014 (H.R. 4837).\n\nA recent Harvard study says it\u2019s no easier to climb the income ladder now than it was 20 years ago, a trend we should be focused on improving, especially since according to the Federal Reserve, one in five people who are near retirement age have zero money saved. With half of our workers devoid of retirement accounts, there\u2019s no denying something needs to be done.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOur bill, which had 97 bipartisan cosponsors in the 112Congress, eliminates barriers that business owners currently face in establishing a new S corporation ESOP or expanding the employee-ownership stake in an S corporation. Eighteen years ago, Congress created the S corporation ESOP structure to encourage and expand retirement savings, giving more workers in private companies the chance to own their companies through an ESOP, a qualified retirement savings program.\n\nMore than 2,000 privately held \"Subchapter S\" corporations in the U.S. are owned mostly or entirely by their workers through broad-based employee stock ownership plans. Close to a million employees who are part of S ESOPs have retirement account balances on average three to five times higher than the average U.S. 401(k), and the funds invested come from the company's profits, not from the worker's personal funds.\n\nIn a recent report, economist Alex Brill said, \u201cBeyond the immediate benefit they provide to employees and customers, S ESOPs\u2019 positive outcomes yield benefits to the U.S. economy broadly.\u201d The study, Macroeconomic Impact of S ESOPs on the U.S. Economy, also found total direct and indirect output from these companies is nearly 2 percent of gross domestic product.\n\nWhen we visit employee-owned companies, we can immediately tell there is truly something special and different when employees have \u201cthe American Dream at Work.\u201d As Congress contemplates measures to grow and retain good jobs and increase retirement security for American workers, we should look to employee ownership as a model that works.\n\nReichert has represented Washington's 8th Congressional District since 2005.
