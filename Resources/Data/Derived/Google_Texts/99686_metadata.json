ACOs are affiliations of doctors, hospitals, and other providers that jointly care for Medicare patients with the goal of pocketing a portion of what they save the government. Those that spend above Medicare estimates stand to lose money.\n\nThere are more than 330 such networks around the country caring for about 5 million people through the Medicare Shared Savings Program, which includes most of the ACOs. The revisions to the program are intended to entice providers to form new ACOs and to keep existing ones in the program, which is voluntary.\n\nFDA Okays Second Pump-Sensor Combo\n\nThe FDA approved the Animas Vibe, an integrated insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor (CGM) system, for insulin-dependent diabetes patients ages 18 and up, the company announced Tuesday.\n\nIt is the second CGM-enabled insulin pump to come to market; the first was the Medtronic MiniMed, approved in April 2006.\n\nThe pump has a Dexcom G4 Platinum CGM built right into it, enabling patients to view their glucose data and administer insulin directly from the pump, which allows them to carry one less piece of equipment.\n\nAnimas said it is now accepting orders for the device and expects to start shipping in January 2015.\n\nHHS Civil Rights Director Talks Opportunities, Challenges\n\nMedPage Today News Editor Joyce Frieden talked Tuesday with OCR Director Jocelyn Samuels about sex discrimination in healthcare, the Ebola Bulletin, and privacy and security protections surrounding mental health information during background checks for gun ownership, as well as the office's expanded powers under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nSamuels, who began her job in August, was previously the acting assistant attorney general for civil rights at the Department of Justice, where she managed the operations of the Civil Rights Division.\n\nNext Week\n\nOn Monday, the Alliance for Health Reform will convene a panel to discuss policy, regulatory, and other concerns related to digital health innovations.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Senate Subcommittee on African Affairs will discuss the Ebola epidemic and the international response.\n\nOn Thursday, the FDA's Pediatric Oncologic Subcommittee will discuss the potential of three new adult cancer drugs in various stages of development for use in children.\n\nOn Friday, the Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee will discuss the Superion InterSpinous Spacer for patients suffering from pain and numbness and/or cramping in the legs.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Shannon  Firth", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/Washington-Watch/Washington-Watch/48959", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/media/images/48xxx/48959.jpg", "description": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced new regulations to stomp out Medicare fraud and proposed delaying penalties for poorly performing ACOs.", "card": "Summary", "title": "D.C Week: CMS Addresses Medicare Fraud, ACO Penalties"}, "dc.date.issued": "2014-12-06 12:00:00", "sailthru.is_cme": 0, "sailthru.tags": "primarycare,publichealthpolicy,generalprimarycare,washington-watch,hospitalbasedmedicine,fdageneral,nursing,nursing", "sailthru.date": "2014-12-06 12:00:00", "sailthru.title": "D.C Week: CMS Addresses Medicare Fraud, ACO Penalties", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "verify-v1": "Vy2WQqSVx1yA90Uu2Rw12f2R8yqP7X0cxBFbafIuqao=", "sailthru.exclude": 1, "description": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced new regulations to stomp out Medicare fraud and proposed delaying penalties for poorly performing ACOs.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-12-07 12:12:00", "date": "2014-12-06 12:00:00", "sailthru.description": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced new regulations to stomp out Medicare fraud and proposed delaying penalties for poorly performing ACOs.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"url": "http://www.medpagetoday.com/Washington-Watch/Washington-Watch/48959", "image": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/media/images/48xxx/48959.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced new regulations to stomp out Medicare fraud and proposed delaying penalties for poorly performing ACOs.", "title": "D.C Week: CMS Addresses Medicare Fraud, ACO Penalties"}, "sailthru.featured": 1, "dc.date": "2014-12-06 12:00:00", "sailthru.is_video": 0, "google-site-verification": "0uwxbLV_H5lccP3wm0UgRXFQ9w6ZQXh9ZLn-G0av8i0", "sailthru.speciality": "primarycare,Other,hospitalmedicine", "sailthru.image.full": "http://clf1.medpagetoday.com/media/images/48xxx/48959.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0039\"", "article_summary": "The agency's strategy for curbing unscrupulous providers includes using new predictive analytics technology, implementing fingerprint-based criminal background checks, and temporarily freezing enrollment of new ambulances and home health providers in seven \"fraud hot spots.\"\nACOs are affiliations of doctors, hospitals, and other providers that jointly care for Medicare patients with the goal of pocketing a portion of what they save the government.\nThis week in Washington, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced new regulations to stomp out Medicare fraud and proposed delaying penalties for poorly performing ACOs, while the FDA approved another pump-sensor combo for insulin-dependent diabetics.\nThe proposal is one of dozens of changes that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services wants to make to rules governing accountable care organizations.\nOn Wednesday, the Senate Subcommittee on African Affairs will discuss the Ebola epidemic and the international response."}
