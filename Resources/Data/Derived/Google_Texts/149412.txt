Coloradans will honor slain Park County Cpl. Nate Carrigan on Monday.

Gov. John Hickenlooper ordered flags to fly at half-staff from sunrise to sunset Monday on all public buildings statewide.

Carrigan, 35, was killed Feb. 24 in a shootout while serving a “high-risk” eviction notice in Bailey. Two other deputies were wounded, and the homeowner, Martin Wirth, was killed.

Officials also announced several Denver area highways will be affected by Carrigan’s funeral procession.

The Jefferson County sheriff’s office announced the procession will begin at 9 a.m. Monday and proceed from Bailey to Arvada. Drivers should also expect traffic disruptions on highways that feed into the procession route.

Carrigan’s funeral service is scheduled to start at 11 a.m. Monday at Faith Bible Chapel, 6210 Ward Road in Arvada.

Carrigan was a 13-year veteran of the Park County Sheriff’s Department, and also worked as assistant coach for the Platte Canyon High School football team and head coach of the school’s baseball team.
