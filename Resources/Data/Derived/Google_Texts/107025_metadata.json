Many close calls occurred during takeoffs and landings at the nation\u2019s busiest airports, presenting a new threat to aviation safety after decades of steady improvement in air travel.\n\nRelated: 12 Weird Uses for Drones\n\nMany of the previously unreported incident reports \u2014 released Wednesday by the FAA in response to long-standing public-records requests from The Washington Post and other news organizations \u2014 occurred near New York and Washington.\n\nThe FAA data indicates that drones are posing a much greater hazard to air traffic than previously recognized. Until Wednesday, the FAA had publicly disclosed only one other near-collision between a drone and a passenger aircraft: a March 22 incident involving a US Airways regional airliner near Tallahassee, Fla.\n\nThe newly released incident reports, however, reveal that the FAA has been receiving a steady stream of near-miss alerts from airliners and private pilots since then.\n\nOn Sept. 30, air-traffic controllers at LaGuardia Airport in New York reported that Republic Airlines Flight 6230 was \u201calmost hit\u201d by a brightly colored small drone at an altitude of 4,000 feet as the passenger plane was descending to land. On Sept. 8 at LaGuardia, three different regional airliners \u2014 Express Jet, Pinnacle and Chautauqua \u2014 reported \u201cvery close calls\u201d with a drone within minutes of one another at an altitude of about 2,000 feet as they were preparing to land.\n\nRelated: How Drones Could Help America's Infrastructure\n\nOn July 29, a US Airways shuttle flight that had departed from Reagan National Airport reported an extraordinarily narrow encounter with a yellow drone with a four-foot wingspan that suddenly passed within 50 feet of the aircraft while it was approaching LaGuardia.\n\nOutside Washington, Porter Airlines Flight 725 from Toronto was descending to Dulles International Airport at an altitude of 2,800 feet on June 29 when it reported that a black-and-silver drone zipped past, just 50 feet away. On June 1, a United Airlines flight originating from Rome alerted the control tower at Dulles that a four-engine helicopter drone interfered with its descent and passed just 100 feet underneath the Boeing 767.\n\nThe 25 near-midair collisions were among more than 175 incidents in which pilots and air-traffic controllers have reported seeing drones near airports or in restricted airspace since June. Pilots described most of the rogue drones as small, camera-equipped models that have become increasingly popular with hobbyists and photographers.\n\nAlthough such drones often measure only a few feet in diameter and weigh less than 10 pounds, aviation safety experts say they could easily trigger an accident by striking another plane\u2019s propeller or getting sucked into a jet engine.\n\nRelated: Why Drones Are Too Valuable to Dismiss\n\n\u201cThe potential for catastrophic damage is certainly there,\u201d said Fred Roggero, a retired Air Force major general who was in charge of aviation safety investigations for the service and now serves as a consultant to companies seeking to fly drones commercially.\n\nThe reported increase in dangerous encounters comes as the FAA is facing pressure from federal lawmakers and drone manufacturers to move more quickly to open the skies to remotely controlled aircraft.\n\nUnder a 2012 law, Congress ordered the FAA to safely integrate drones into the national airspace. The FAA is still developing regulations to make that happen, a process that is expected to take years.\n\nUnder FAA guidelines, it is legal for hobbyists to fly small drones for recreational purposes, as long as they keep them under 400 feet, at least five miles away from airports and outside other restricted areas. Flying drones for commercial purposes is largely prohibited, although the FAA has begun to issue special permits to filmmakers and other industries to operate drones on a case-by-case basis until the agency can adopt a final set of safety regulations.\n\nRelated: Everything You Wanted to Know About Drones But Were Afraid to Google (INFOGRAPHIC)\n\nThe FAA, however, is struggling to keep up with an influx of cheap drones that have flooded the market. According to some estimates, half a million small drones have been sold in the U.S. in the past three years. The aviation-safety agency lacks the manpower to police airports or effectively track down offenders. Only a handful of rogue drone operators have been apprehended or penalized across the country.\n\nIn a statement, the FAA acknowledged that it is now receiving about 25 reports a month from pilots who have spotted drones flying in restricted airspace or in close proximity to other aircraft.\n\n\u201cIn partnership with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, the FAA has identified unsafe and unauthorized [drone] operations and contacted the individual operators to educate them about how they can operate safely under current regulations and laws,\u201d the agency said.\n\nPreviously, the only other occasion in which the FAA has released data on drone sightings near airports came in June, when The Post reported that the agency had received a total of 15 reports of risky encounters over a period of two years \u2014 or an average of fewer than one incident a month.\n\nRelated: 10 High-Tech College Classes: Learn to Fly a Drone\n\nAsked why there had been such a large increase in reports since then, the FAA said in a statement Wednesday that the difference could be \u201cattributed to increased awareness by pilots and the public and improved reporting and record-keeping processes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Pilots around the United States have reported a surge in near-collisions and other dan", "title": "Drones Pose Fresh Threat to Commercial Flight Safety", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/27/Drones-Post-Fresh-Threat-Commercial-Flight-Safety", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Amazon_Prime_Air.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/11/27/Drones-Post-Fresh-Threat-Commercial-Flight-Safety", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Amazon_Prime_Air.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Pilots around the United States have reported a surge in near-collisions and other dan", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda3d3\"", "article_summary": "According to some estimates, half a million small drones have been sold in the U.S. in the past three years.\nPilots described most of the rogue drones as small, camera-equipped models that have become increasingly popular with hobbyists and photographers.\nThe FAA data indicates that drones are posing a much greater hazard to air traffic than previously recognized.\nMany close calls occurred during takeoffs and landings at the nation\u2019s busiest airports, presenting a new threat to aviation safety after decades of steady improvement in air travel.\nUnder a 2012 law, Congress ordered the FAA to safely integrate drones into the national airspace."}
