Hastings students ‘Go Buggy’ for seniors

Westborough – Students from Danielle King's second grade class at the Elsie A. Hastings Elementary School “buzz” about outside the Salmon Health and Retirement complex after performing a show for the residents June 6.

Each year, according to Leigh Becker, the school's principal, the entire second grade class performs a musical production of “Goin” Buggy!” The annual production is done as the culminating activity in their unit on studying insects. The students performed for their families June 5 and then the following morning, took their act across the road as a treat for the seniors.
