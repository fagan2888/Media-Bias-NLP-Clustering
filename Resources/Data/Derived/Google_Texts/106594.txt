Flowers Foods Bites Bread, As M&A in Healthy Foods Continues

The baked foods company is buying Daves Killer Bread from the Dahl Family and Goode Partners

Flowers Foods Inc. (NYSE: FLO) is buying bread baking company Daves Killer Bread from the founding Dahl Family and Goode Partners LLC for $275 million in cash.

Milwaukie, Oregon-based Daves, founded in 1955, is known for making 17 varieties of whole-grain and organic bread. The target is anticipating 2016 sales of up to $170 million. Daves will remain an independent of subsidiary of Flowers after the acquisition closes by years end. Thomasville, Georgia-based Flowers is funding the acquisition with cash on hand and debt. New York-based Goode Partners acquired a 50 percent stake in Daves in January 2013.

"This is a well-positioned, fast growing company with excellent brand equity and an on-trend organic portfolio that appeals to today's consumers, says Flowers CEO Allen Shiver.

Healthy food companies continue to attract buyer interest as they try to meet consumer demand for healthier food options. For instance, WhiteWave Foods Co. (NYSE: WWAV) is buying privately-held yogurt maker Wallaby Yogurt Company Inc. in a $125 million cash deal and closed the $550 million acquisition of protein powder maker Sequel Naturals Ltd. from VMG Partners, on August 1.
