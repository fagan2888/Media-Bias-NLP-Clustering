The water level is 8.5 feet below conservation pool at Wilson State Lake, which is a record low.

Wilson State Lake receives most all of its' water from the Saline River.

Currently, the Saline River is supplying less than one cubic foot per second. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which manage the lake, are required to let 15 cubic feet per second of water out of the lake. In addition, evaporation is taking water away too.

"We have not been at conservation pool since September of 2011 and essentially the problem is, it remains quite dry," said Dan Hays of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at Wilson State Lake.

Most of the recharge the lake receives occurs in June.

There is dirt showing in the middle of the lake because of the receding water.

Local shops around the lake are not worried about the lake losing tourism. The manager at Knotheads Baitshop says that all of the features the surrounding area of the lake has will keep tourist coming.

Hays says that it is not dangerous for people to go boating.

Wilson lake has been a stable lake when dealing with water levels. There have been two previous instances when the levels were low, 2006 and in the lat 1980's, but the levels currently are the lowest on record.

There is the potential that the low water levels might cause environmental issues. Officials will be monitoring changes in wildlife and plants.
