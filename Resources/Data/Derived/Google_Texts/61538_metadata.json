But Obama\u2019s \u201cpen and phone\u201d strategy for advancing his agenda is no joke. The phrase \u201cpen and phone\u201d became associated with the president when he promised, in his first cabinet meeting of 2014, to \u201cmove the ball forward\u201d should Congress not cooperate with his agenda:\n\nOne of the things that I will be emphasizing in this meeting is the fact that we are not just going to be waiting for legislation in order to make sure that we are providing Americans the kind of help that they need. I\u2019ve got a pen, and I\u2019ve got a phone, and I can use that pen to sign executive orders and take executive actions and administrative actions that move the ball forward.\n\nPreferably, the ball will be \u201cmoved forward\u201d with the concurrence of Congress. Should Congress prove negligent in its sacred charge of advancing the president\u2019s agenda, however, that ball must be \u2014 and will be \u2014 moved forward by other means.\n\nAs the admiring media have documented, Obama is making good on his promise of executive unilateralism. An MSNBC article of April 4 finds him \u201cpicking up his pen and phone to move two issues forward by executive action: education policy and equal pay.\u201d\n\nThe education part refers to Obama\u2019s establishment of Youth Career Connect grants, which are expected to award a total of over $100 million to \u201cschool districts, institutions of higher education, the workforce investment system, and their partners\u201d with the aim of providing \u201creal-world learning opportunities for students.\u201d\n\nThe White House press release announcing an Obama visit to a Maryland high school to reveal the grant winners said: \u201cPresident Obama has made clear that he is committed to making 2014 a year of action by taking steps \u2014 both with Congress and on his own \u2014 to expand opportunity for all Americans\u201d (emphasis added).\n\nThe reference to \u201cequal pay\u201d concerns Obama\u2019s signing of two executive orders dealing with the policies of federal contractors. One prohibits retaliation against female workers who discuss their pay, and the other requires disclosure of data on the gender, race, and pay of new hires. Earlier, the White House issued an executive order raising the minimum wage for federal contractors and subcontractors, again circumventing a Congress reluctant to take up the issue.\n\nObama followed up with another pen-and-phone action concerning federal contractors on June 17. LGBT groups were frustrated that the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity by employers nationwide, was halted in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. \u201cIn the meantime,\u201d writes Jennifer Bendery at the Huffington Post, \u201cpressure has grown for presidential action that doesn\u2019t require legislative approval.\u201d So the White House issued an executive order forbidding federal contractors and subcontractors from engaging in such discrimination.\n\nThe same day, Obama announced his intention to expand the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument from 87,000 square miles to nearly 782,000. Miffed that he did not first consult with Congress, House Natural Resources Committee chairman Doc Hastings (R., Wash.) declared the act to be \u201canother example of this imperial presidency.\u201d\n\nWhile the term \u201cpen and phone strategy\u201d became popularized only this year, unilateral executive action is not new to the administration. Among the most prominent of his earlier \u201cpen and phone\u201d maneuvers are the changes made to the Affordable Care Act since its ratification in 2010. Galen.org keeps an ever-expanding list of changes made by Obama to the ACA. To date, there have been 23 changes made by administrative action, which include delaying the individual and employer mandates.\n\nIn 2012, Obama used his pen-and-phone strategy to \u201cmove forward\u201d on immigration. When the DREAM Act, which would grant legal status to some young illegal immigrants, did not pass the Senate, Obama issued an executive order that deferred deportation for some young aliens under the moniker Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Factcheck.com denied that this action constituted illegal enactment of the DREAM Act by the president. The move arguably undermined the rule of law nonetheless.\n\nMany expect \u2014 and some hope \u2014 that more pen-and-phone action on this front awaits us. Republican senator Marco Rubio (Fla.) has raised the possibility that Obama would try to use his executive authority to \u201clegalize\u201d the 11 million illegal immigrants already in place. That\u2019s an extreme-case scenario, but some immigration advocates have proposed unilateral executive action should the legislative process fail to deliver.\n\nIn a 2013 article for National Journal, Fawn Johnson praises the Obama administration for being \u201cwilling to exert authority to stop the deportation of hundreds of thousands of undocumented youth through its deferred-action program announced last year.\u201d She calls for further unilateral action from the White House, noting that \u201cpolitically, all President Obama needs is proof that Congress can\u2019t get the job done.\u201d\n\nPolitically, perhaps.
