For that to happen, more people will have to sign up in the next two weeks than have signed up in the past five months.\n\n\u201cNumbers for the first five months of enrollment under the Affordable Care Act (show) that 113,733 people enrolled in the Illinois Health Insurance Marketplace,\u201d a statement from Get Covered Illinois reads.\n\nThe enrollment figures do not include a breakdown of how many people have actually paid for private insurance through Obamacare, nor do they show how many people are getting insurance for the first time.\n\nNot many, state Sen. Dave Syverson, R-Rockford, said.\n\n\u201cThe number of uninsured individuals, people who did not have insurance in 2013 verses now, you\u2019re talking about well under 50,000 people,\u201d Syverson said.\n\nA GOP senator who sits on the Legislature\u2019s important COGFA commission, Syverson said most of the 113,733 who have signed up for coverage have matriculated from other insurance policies.\n\n\u201c(These) were people who had previous coverage and are signing-up now because they are going to get some assistance for it.\u201d\n\nGet Covered Illinois says 77 percent of people who have signed-up are eligible for some sort of government subsidy, yet hundreds of thousands more are going directly on to government health-care rolls.\n\nIllinois has seen 315,000 people enroll in Medicaid since Obamacare launched, and Gov. Pat Quinn\u2019s administration says as many as 430,000 could enroll by the end of 2014.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s 315,000 right now. We thought we\u2019re going to be at 200,000 this year,\u201d Illinois Healthcare and Family Services\u2019 Director Julie Hamos told lawmakers late last month.\n\nSyverson said the explosion of Medicaid will drive costs up by nearly $1 billion this year. Illinois spent $13 billion on Medicaid last year.\n\nGet Covered Illinois is trying to spin things in a positive direction, saying \u201capproximately 200,000 people\u201d have enrolled in Medicaid through Obamacare. But that figure neglects to note people already eligible for the government program or the 82,000 people pushed to Medicaid in Illinois through the national Obamacare website, Healthcare.gov.\n\nSyverson said it is no longer a question of whether Obamacare is a failure, but a question of what can lawmakers do to fix it.\n\n\u201c(The Democrats\u2019) idea of fixing it is, \u2018Don\u2019t expand private markets. Move more people to Medicaid. There needs to be incremental steps to move it back to the private sector, to the free enterprise system that was working before.\u201d\n\nContact Benjamin Yount at Ben@IllinoisWatchdog.org and find him on Twitter @BenYount.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Illinois is almost 200,000 people short of its Obamacare goals.
