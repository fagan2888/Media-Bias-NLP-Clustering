It began with a \u201cstimulus\u201d that wasted trillions in the quest of generating jobs, but did little to nothing in achieving that goal. That was followed by ObamaCare which most agree has been a disaster for the nation\u2019s healthcare sector and, finally, Common Core, a one-size-fits-all testing program intended, we were told, to improve learning standards in the nation\u2019s schools. The only thing it has achieved is the opposition of parents, teachers unions, and entire states.\n\nIn the April edition of The Heartland Institute\u2019s School Reform News, one could find headlines that included \u201cArizona House Votes to Repeal and Replace Common Core\u201d, \u201cArizona House Votes to Repeal Common Core\u201d, \u201dWest Virginia House Passes Common Core Repeal Bill\u201d, and \u201cOhio Bill Would Protect Students Opting Out of Common Core Tests.\u201d In March, some 19 states had introduced legislation to either halt or replace Common Core. Do you see a trend here?\n\nOne trend of significance was noted in a commentary by Jason L. Riley in the May 6 edition of The Wall Street Journal. \u201cThe Soccer Mom Revolt Against Common Core\u201d cited a national poll released by Fairleigh Dickinson University earlier this year that put \u201capproval for the new standards at 17%, against 40% who disapproved and other 42% who were undecided. A breakdown by gender had Common Core support 22% for men and only 12% for women.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the greatest surprise among these numbers is that the nation\u2019s largest teachers union, the National Educational Association, as Rob Bluey of the Heritage Foundation noted in February \u201cis no longer a cheerleader for Common Core national education standards.\u201d In a letter to the union\u2019s three million members, its president, Dennis Van Roekel, took Common Core to task for its failure to even provide information for implementing it in their classrooms. The American Federation of Teachers had raised similar concerns nearly a year earlier!\n\nWriting on September 2014, Joy Pullman, a Heartland Institute research fellow whose expertise is education held forth on the \u201cTop Ten Things Parents Hate About Common Core.\u201d Among them was \u201cThe senseless, infuriating math.\u201d \u201cIf Common Core hadn\u2019t deformed even the most elementary of our math abilities so that simple addition now takes dots, dashes, boxes, hashmarks, and foam cubes, plus an inordinate amount of time\u201d, you are not going to get the right answer.\n\nParents in growing numbers have discovered, as Pullman notes, that \u201cwhen they do go to their local school boards, often all they get are disgusted looks and a bored thumb-twiddling during their two-minute public comment allowance.\u201d Pullman says, \u201cThe bottom line is, parents have no choice whether their kids will learn Common Core, no matter what school they put them in.\u201d That, obviously, is changing as state after state pulls out of the Common Core program.\n\nIn a new book by Samuel Blumenfeld and Alex Newman, \u201cCrimes of the Educators: How Utopians are Using Government Schools to Destroy America\u2019s Children\u201d, Blumenfeld points to \u201cGrowing levels of illiteracy, plunging international rankings, the decline of critical-thinking skills, mushrooming decadence, mass shootings, and companies that can\u2019t find the skilled workers they need\u2014these have become some of the atrocious hallmarks of U.S. public schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cCommon Core schemers are engaged in what can only be described as consumer fraud with monumental implications for education and the future of America.\u201d The bottom line is that \u201cthe scheme was never field-tested before being foisted on America.\u201d\n\nThere is no part of student\u2019s education that Common Core does not impede or corrupt. In the area of science, Blumenfeld says \u201cInstead of teaching children about science\u2014real science\u2014the standards will offer students a steady stream of controversial propaganda presented as unchallenged fact.\u201d Regarding climate change \u201cstudents will be required to learn that human activities are mostly to blame, even though this notion is disputed by countless scientists and a vast, growing body of actual scientific observational evidence.\u201d\n\nClosest to home are Common Core\u2019s \u201cNational Sexuality Education Standards\u201d aimed to begin the \u201csexualization of children in kindergarten\u201d says Blumenfeld. \u201cIs learning about \u2018homosexual marriage\u2019 before first grade in government schools really \u2018age appropriate\u2019 or necessary?\u201d But it gets more radical \u201cwith graphic lessons promoting everything from masturbation and fornication to transgenderism and homosexuality.\u201d\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t be surprised at the backlash Common Core has received from both parents and teachers unions among others. Like the \u201cstimulus\u201d and ObamaCare, Common Core demonstrates a thorough lack of understanding of the values of individuality that have underwritten our nation\u2019s free market economy, helped create a respected healthcare system, and which parents have expected the educational system to pass on to new generations.\n\nInstead Common Core teaches collectivism\u2014socialism\u2014and degrades various elements of education from math to English to science.\n\nIt cannot be removed from our nation\u2019s schools soon enough.\n\n[Originally published at Warning Signs]", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd4a\"", "article_summary": "In the April edition of The Heartland Institute\u2019s School Reform News, one could find headlines that included \u201cArizona House Votes to Repeal and Replace Common Core\u201d, \u201cArizona House Votes to Repeal Common Core\u201d, \u201dWest Virginia House Passes Common Core Repeal Bill\u201d, and \u201cOhio Bill Would Protect Students Opting Out of Common Core Tests.\u201d In March, some 19 states had introduced legislation to either halt or replace Common Core.\nInstead Common Core teaches collectivism\u2014socialism\u2014and degrades various elements of education from math to English to science.\nThe only thing it has achieved is the opposition of parents, teachers unions, and entire states.\nThat was followed by ObamaCare which most agree has been a disaster for the nation\u2019s healthcare sector and, finally, Common Core, a one-size-fits-all testing program intended, we were told, to improve learning standards in the nation\u2019s schools.\nIt cannot be removed from our nation\u2019s schools soon enough."}
