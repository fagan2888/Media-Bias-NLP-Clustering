I flew out the 30th, spent a few days home, flew (to Denver) and started practicing,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt\u2019s been the longest season of my life \u2014 August 24 (2013) to June 27.\u201d\n\nHe will rest after the summer league, which the Nuggets are now playing in in Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cThis is a once-in-a-lifetime chance,\u201d Green said. \u201cI\u2019m just going to suck it up, do what I\u2019ve got to do, and then after this go on a nice vacation.\u201d\n\nGreen believes he dropped the ball in his first go-round with the Nuggets last summer after they acquired him on draft night. A second-round pick, the 6-foot-4 Green led NCAA Division I in scoring (25.0 points per game) during his senior season at Virginia Tech. But once he got into a Nuggets uniform, he tried so hard to prove he could be a pure point guard, he didn\u2019t do what he does best: score.\n\n\u201cI kept hearing: \u2018He\u2019s only a scorer. He wasn\u2019t a point guard,\u2019 \u201d Green said. \u201cIn my head, I was saying: \u2018I\u2019m going to go out here and show everybody I can facilitate. I\u2019m not just a scorer.\u2019 Honestly, that hurt me more than anything. If you don\u2019t like me for who I am, and I\u2019m a scoring point guard, then maybe I don\u2019t belong. But there\u2019s a lot of scoring point guards (in the NBA). I think I can be one as well.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets, who need a third point guard, are taking a long look at Green during this summer league session. He\u2019s a focal point of the offense, joining veteran forward Quincy Miller and rookie guard Gary Harris.\n\n\u201cRealistically, we want Quincy and Erick Green and Gary to be put in positions where they can excel and they can score, and we can get a look at what they can do on both ends of the floor,\u201d said Nuggets assistant Noel Gillespie, one of the team\u2019s two summer league head coaches.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s 103-76 loss to the Chicago Bulls, Green scored 16 points. He is relishing the chance to show what he can do.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d Green said. \u201cI was drafted to score the ball, be a scoring point guard and make plays. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\nGreen spent the 2013-14 season with Montepaschi Siena in Italy. His return to the U.S. was delayed because of his team\u2019s run to the championship series.\n\nBut Green said the experience has been a big help.\n\n\u201cOverseas, the physical aspect of the game is just different,\u201d Green said. \u201cIf you get hit, there\u2019s no foul called. It\u2019s more physical. And definitely if you\u2019re an American. When I first arrived there, I got laid on my butt a few times looking for the foul and the ref was like, \u2018Get up.\u2019 In college, I got every call I needed. It was an eye-opener.\u201d\n\nThe Nuggets were off Monday and wrap up preliminary play in Las Vegas on Tuesday against Utah.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Erick Green travels long road in past year for second shot with Nuggets", "title": "Erick Green travels long road in past year for second shot with Nuggets", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/14/erick-green-travels-long-road-in-past-year-for-second-shot-with-nuggets/", "image": {"width": 536, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140714__green-summerp1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140714__green-summerp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-14T14:45:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:31:17+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI was drafted to score the ball, be a scoring point guard and make plays.\nHe wasn\u2019t a point guard,\u2019 \u201d Green said.\nIf you don\u2019t like me for who I am, and I\u2019m a scoring point guard, then maybe I don\u2019t belong.\n\u201cIn my head, I was saying: \u2018I\u2019m going to go out here and show everybody I can facilitate.\nI think I can be one as well.\u201dThe Nuggets, who need a third point guard, are taking a long look at Green during this summer league session."}
