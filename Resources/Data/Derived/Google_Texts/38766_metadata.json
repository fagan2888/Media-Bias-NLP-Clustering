Jim Gerlach Jim GerlachBig names free to lobby in 2016 Ex-Rep. Gerlach ditches K St. in return to campaign world Ex-Sen. Pryor heading to K Street MORE (R-Pa.) will take the helm of an organization aimed at getting more businesses and their employees involved in elections later this year.\n\n\n\nHe\u2019s leaving his K Street gig at Venable after only six months to become the president and CEO of the Business-Industry Political Action Committee (BIPAC), the organization announced on Thursday.\n\n\n\nFormer Senate Sergeant at Arms Gregory Casey, the organization\u2019s outgoing leader, announced in December his intention to retire this year. He had led the organization since 1999. Executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles International quickly got to work to find a replacement.\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBIPAC, a campaign vehicle made up of 7,300 businesses and industry groups, raises money to give to candidates while encouraging employers to engage with their employees about the policies that affect their workplaces.\u201cThe position at BIPAC combines really what I\u2019ve been doing over the last 24 years \u2014 combining policy, politics and team-leading,\u201d he told The Hill. \u201cThe opportunity came along and I couldn\u2019t let it pass by.\u201dThe former Pennsylvania lawmaker retired from Congress at the end of last year after serving for six terms. He also worked in the Pennsylvania legislature for more than a decade. Most recently, Gerlach served on the congressional tax-writing panel, but also sat on transportation, financial services and small-business committees throughout his career.\u201cAs a candidate for public office, early in my career, BIPAC provided me \u2014 personally \u2014 and my campaign with tremendous value as I transitioned from a state legislator to a U.S. Congressman,\u201d Gerlach said in a statement. \u201cI look forward to joining BIPAC and assisting its members and partners in advancing their political, public policy, and business objectives.\u201d\u201cThis is a critical point in time for the business community as Congress considers a range of important issues and I could not be more excited to help lead the effort to advance the interests of America\u2019s job creators,\u201d he said.The political action committee has raised about $22,000 so far in the two-year 2016 election cycle.During its most lucrative cycle, the 2012 presidential race, the organization took in about $476,000 and doled out $219,000 to candidates.While BIPAC is mostly focused on voter education and encouraging people to become more involved in elections, donations to business friendly candidates boost its influence.Gerlach anticipates upping the money ante in election cycles going forward, he told The Hill. Once he takes the reins on June 22, strategic meetings involving goals and a vision for the PAC\u2019s future will begin.\u201c2016 is a huge election year,\u201d he said. \u201cThis organization is going to move forward and it\u2019s going to grow and it\u2019s going to continue to have an important role in the process.\u201d\"From state houses to the U.S. Senate, the business community helped to educate and motivate voters that will translate into stronger and more effective governance in the weeks and months ahead,\" Casey said in a December statement. \"The key now will be to sustain these victories heading into 2016. Our team is already hard at work to strengthen our products and technologies, based on our members' feedback, and BIPAC looks forward to unveiling them next year.\"\n\n\u201cGerlach\u2019s expertise in free market based public policies that create jobs and promote economic prosperity, combined with his trusted expertise in state and federal governments will drive additional value to our Prosperity Project network of partners and members spanning all 50 states,\u201d said former Rep. Tom Tauke (R-Iowa), now a board member at BIPAC.\n\n\n\nThe Prosperity Project, the PAC says, is \u201cone of the nation\u2019s most expansive grassroots and political operations that promotes and empowers employer-to-employee advocacy best practices.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cBIPAC helps employers small and large play a more active role in the public policy-making process,\u201d Tauke said.\n\n\n\nRob Smith, the co-chairman of Venable\u2019s legislative and government affairs advocacy team, said the split is happening on good terms.\n\n\n\n\u201cJim will be extremely effective with BIPAC\u2019s corporate and association members and its vast network of state and local business partners throughout America,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\n\nSaid Gerlach, \u201cVenable is a great law firm with great attorneys, and I will continue to have a good relationship with them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The former lawmaker will become CEO of the Business-Industry Political Action Committee.", "description": "The former lawmaker will become CEO of the Business-Industry Political Action Committee.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Megan R.
