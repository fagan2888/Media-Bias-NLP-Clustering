Officials in Arizona said that though the illegal immigrants have been told to report to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) center within 15 days, they have no idea where the illegal immigrants are going.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs told Brewer that 432 such children were expected to be transported on Friday and another 734 over the weekend.\n\nBrewer said that she was \u201cdisturbed and outraged\u201d that the Obama administration continues to implement this \u201cdangerous and inhumane policy\u201d while \u201cneglecting to answer crucial questions our citizens demand and deserve.\u201d She noted, \u201cNot only does the federal government have no plan to stop this disgraceful policy, it also has no plan to deal with the endless waves of illegal aliens once they are released here.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Obama administration put half the effort into securing our border as it has invested to institute this operation, our state and nation would not be facing this situation,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a crisis of the federal government\u2019s creation, and the fact that the border remains unsecure \u2013 now apparently intentionally \u2013 while this operation continues full-steam ahead is deplorable.\u201d\n\nBreitbart Texas first reported photos of illegal immigrants from Central America being warehoused in Texas, and Arizona may face a similar situation as officials scrambled to find medical supplies for the recently dumped illegal immigrants.\n\nA holding center in Nogales had to be opened \u201cbecause the Department of Health and Human Services had nowhere to turn,\u201d and a Department of Homeland Security official told the Associated Press \u201cthat children are sleeping on plastic cots but about 2,000 mattresses have been ordered, and portable toilets and showers have been brought to the holding center \u2013 a warehouse that has not been used for detention in years.\u201d\n\nThe warehouse reportedly has a capacity of about 1,500, and a Homeland Security official said, \u201cAs quickly as we move them out, we get more. We believe this is just a start.\u201d\n\nLast week, Brewer wrote President Barack Obama a letter, slamming the federal government for not informing Arizona officials before they decided to send thousands of illegal immigrants into her state. She demanded answers about who was responsible for the decision.\n\n\u201cWhat I learned from federal officials today only raises more questions about this operation, and the few answers I did receive have only heightened my concerns,\u201d Brewer asserted. \u201cCitizens demand \u2013 and so should the media \u2013 the reason for this massive influx of illegal crossings and the cost to taxpayers for having to deal with the crisis created by the President.\u201d\n\nBrewer said she has reached out to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson for answers and again called on President Obama to \u201cterminate this operation immediately\u201d and secure the border.\n\nBrewer said she has reached out to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson for answers and again called on President Barack Obama to \u201c terminate this operation immediately\u201d and secure the border.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Friday, Arizona had to reopen a detention center to warehouse illegal immigrants from Central America that the federal government sent from Texas.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "On Friday, Arizona had to reopen a detention center to warehouse illegal immigrants from Central America that the federal government sent from Texas.", "title": "Obama Admin to Dump over 1,000 Illegal Immigrants in AZ This Weekend - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/0DE95AE441AB4D019EB067441B7C2450.ashx", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/06/07/obama-admin-to-dump-1-000-more-illegals-in-az-this-weekend-this-is-just-a-start/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Friday, Arizona had to reopen a detention center to warehouse illegal immigrants from Central America that the federal government sent from Texas.", "title": "Obama Admin to Dump over 1,000 Illegal Immigrants in AZ This Weekend - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/0DE95AE441AB4D019EB067441B7C2450.ashx", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Homeland Security, Illegal Immigrants, Jeh Johnson,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Jeh Johnson", "published_time": "2014-06-07T06:54:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaed3\"", "article_summary": "Officials in Arizona said that though the illegal immigrants have been told to report to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) center within 15 days, they have no idea where the illegal immigrants are going.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROn Friday, Arizona had to reopen a detention center to warehouse illegal immigrants from Central America that the federal government sent from Texas.\nArizona Governor Jan Brewer said more than 1,000 illegal immigrant children will be dropped off in Arizona this weekend, continuing what she said is the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cdangerous policy\u201d of dumping illegal immigrants from Central American countries into Arizona, something that will continue into the foreseeable future.\nWe believe this is just a start.\u201dLast week, Brewer wrote President Barack Obama a letter, slamming the federal government for not informing Arizona officials before they decided to send thousands of illegal immigrants into her state.\nBrewer said she has reached out to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson for answers and again called on President Barack Obama to \u201c terminate this operation immediately\u201d and secure the border."}
