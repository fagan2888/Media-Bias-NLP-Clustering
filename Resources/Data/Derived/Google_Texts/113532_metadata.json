As do the vast majority of Americans. And as a result, in the US, 48 million people will fall ill every year due to food poisoning caused by salmonella, campylobacter, E. coli, and other food-born pathogens. Poultry is the number one culprit.\n\nAccording to Consumer Reports, 97% of chicken breast sold in grocery stores is tainted with harmful bacteria. What\u2019s worse, at least half of the samples contained fecal contaminants, and half of them also contained at least one bacterium that was resistant to commonly-prescribed antibiotics. Multi-drug resistance is a serious global health threat.\n\nAccording to samples taken by Consumer Reports scientists, dangerous amounts of bacteria were present in every brand of chicken that was tested, with no discernible differences in those labeled \u201cNatural\u201d or \u201cOrganic.\u201d Over half the samples contained fecal contaminants (which are particularly worrisome), and E. coli was found in 65.2% of them. Again, this was across all brands and regardless of labels like \u201cNatural\u201d or \u201cOrganic.\u201d\n\nIf this surprises you, you\u2019re probably not alone. Many consumers expect that these labels actually mean something, in terms of quality or health. But more often than not, the consumer is just making an assumption. Because very few people know what\u2019s required in order to earn such a label. What is \u201corganic chicken,\u201d really? Or \u201cNatural\u201d or \u201cNon-GMO\u201d or \u201cCage-Free\u201d? What do these words really mean?\n\nOrganic: For chicken to be labeled \u201corganic,\u201d the animal must have been given non-GMO, exclusively vegetarian feed that wasn\u2019t grown using synthetic pesticides. The chickens can be given antibiotics, as long as the antibiotics are deemed \u201cmedically necessary\u201d \u2014 at the discretion of the farmer. The chickens must be given access to the outdoors, but with absolutely no standard or requirement as to size of the outdoor space, the size of the door leading to the outdoor space, or the amount of time the chickens are granted access to the outdoor space. Organic certification does not require any indoor enrichment, any additional indoor space, any attention to indoor air quality, any regulation of light exposure (chickens are often illuminated continuously, which interferes with their biological rhythms), and does not require any sort of \u201chumane\u201d or special treatment during slaughter.\n\nHumanely Raised: There is no standard definition or government regulation for this term, and therefore it is essentially meaningless. \u201cHumanely Raised\u201d chickens can be subjected to unrestrained antibiotics use, and can be fed a diet of GMOs, animal by-products, and food grown using synthetic pesticides. They are not necessarily granted outdoor access or indoor enrichment. They don\u2019t get additional indoor space or improved air quality, they aren\u2019t granted periods of darkness to rest, and there are no additional regulations regarding slaughter line treatment or slaughter line speed. \u201dHumanely Raised\u201d means nothing.\n\nNo Hormones: There is, by law, no use of growth hormones in any chickens that are destined for US markets. Which means that this term, too, is essentially meaningless. \u201cNo Hormones\u201d chicken could be conventionally-raised, factory farmed chicken.\n\nCage-Free: More marketing jargon, since literally all the chickens raised for meat in the US are raised outside of individual cages. This term lends no insight into the conditions the chickens are kept in, whether they are given access to outdoors, or how much space each bird is given.\n\nFree-Range: A bit better than cage-free, but not much. The chickens can be raised totally conventionally, factory farm-style, except that they must be given access to outdoor space. However, there is no regulated definition of \u201coutdoor space.\u201d There are no rules governing the size of the outdoor space, the size of the door leading to the outdoor space, or the amount of time that door is open. As well, there are no inspections required to maintain such a label.\n\nNatural or All Natural: The most dishonest, most manipulative label of them all. \u201cNatural,\u201d as applied to food packaging, indicates only that the product was \u201cminimally processed,\u201d and contains no artificial ingredients. In this case, it says absolutely nothing as to how the chickens were raised (what sort of conditions, how much space, etc), how they were fed (genetically modified feed sprayed with toxic pesticides, animal byproducts, etc), how they were treated (if they were given antibiotics, synthetic amino acids, etc), or how they were slaughtered.\n\nThe \u201cNatural\u201d label is so egregious because it\u2019s so misunderstood. Of all the US residents polled by Consumer Reports, more than half believed that \u201cNatural\u201d chicken products were free from antibiotics and were never fed GMOs. Over 40% believed that the label meant the chickens were raised outdoors in pasture, and more than a third thought that \u201cNatural\u201d was synonymous with \u201cOrganic.\u201d It isn\u2019t. When it comes to chicken, \u201cNatural\u201d doesn\u2019t mean much of anything at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo now you know that there\u2019s a whole lot you don\u2019t know \u2014 can\u2019t know \u2014 when it comes to consumer health and quality control in poultry packaging. And if you\u2019re going to buy it, you\u2019ll need to do your own due diligence and make sure you follow proper safety precautions.\n\nOr, you know, make it easy on yourself and just give up the meat completely. It\u2019s so easy!\n\nRelated:\n\n16 Vegan Recipes with 3 Ingredients or Less\n\n5 Gross Facts You Never Knew About Grocery Food", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new report shows that 97% of grocery store chicken is contaminated with disease-causing bacteria, regardless of conventional, natural, or organic label.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/greenliving/1289/1288233.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1803\"", "article_summary": "However, there is no regulated definition of \u201coutdoor space.\u201d There are no rules governing the size of the outdoor space, the size of the door leading to the outdoor space, or the amount of time that door is open.\nCage-Free: More marketing jargon, since literally all the chickens raised for meat in the US are raised outside of individual cages.\nWhen it comes to chicken, \u201cNatural\u201d doesn\u2019t mean much of anything at all.\nThe chickens can be given antibiotics, as long as the antibiotics are deemed \u201cmedically necessary\u201d \u2014 at the discretion of the farmer.\nWhat is \u201corganic chicken,\u201d really?"}
