The practical outcome of that decision may prove to be a boon to religious liberty, but a Supreme Court with only eight justices has the potential to create a great deal of problems going forward.\n\nThe death of Justice Antonin Scalia, who was perhaps the most conservative justice at the time of his passing, has left the High Court with four Republican appointees and four Democratic appointees. Ideologically, the court is split down the middle and therefore unable to break a number of judicial stalemates, such as a recent organized-labor case where a lower court decision forces all California teachers to pay union dues. The result is a situation where such deadlocks are making the Supreme Court increasingly unable to adequately fulfill its constitutional responsibilities.\n\nThis is no accident. Republicans in Congress have made no secret of their desire to delay filling the court vacancy until a new president is elected. While the rationale for doing so is hotly debated, in practical terms, there\u2019s an awful lot of uncertainty inherent to that approach.\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, recently released a list of possible judicial appointments that is being praised in conservative circles, but Trump\u2019s mercurial nature raises legitimate doubts about how seriously he takes this responsibility. In addition, even reliably conservative presidents have nominated justices whose record on the court is not ideologically consistent with that of the president who nominated them. There\u2019s no guarantee that a justice nominated after the 2016 vote would render opinions any more acceptable to Republican congressional leaders than Merrick Garland, President Obama\u2019s nominee that Republicans refuse to even consider.\n\nBut there is a principle at stake here that transcends partisan politics. The legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the federal government were intended to provide a system of checks and balances, so it\u2019s more than a little unsettling to see one branch of government so contemptuous of another that they\u2019re willing to effectively sideline the judiciary for an entire year. Surely Congress has a responsibility to at least give the president\u2019s nominee a fair hearing. The Supreme Court may not always issue decisions with which Congress, republicans, or even this newspaper will agree, but the court's constitutional authority deserves more respect than it is currently being afforded.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@deseretnews", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deseret-news/id425758986?mt=8&uo=4", "iphone": "itms://itunes.apple.com/us/app/deseret-news/id425758986?mt=8&uo=4", "googleplay": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.deseretnews.android"}, "name": {"ipad": "Deseret News", "iphone": "Deseret News", "googleplay": "Deseret News"}, "id": {"ipad": 425758986, "iphone": 425758986, "googleplay": "com.deseretnews.android"}}, "description": "Hobbling the Supreme Court for up to a year with an unfilled vacancy is not in America's best interest.", "card": "summary", "title": "In our opinion: Divided 8-judge Supreme Court not in America's..."}, "datePublished": "2016-05-21", "vr": {"category": "opinion", "type": "article"}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"description": "Hobbling the court for up to a year with an unfilled vacancy is not in America's best interest.", "tagline": "In our opinion", "image": "//img.deseretnews.com/images/promo/articlefeature/161595/161595.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-05-21T00:00-06:00", "articleid": 865654745, "recommendable": "true"}}, "speare-timestamp": "2016-05-20 19:36:17", "copyright": "\u00a9 2016 Deseret News Publishing Company", "title": "In our opinion: Divided 8-judge Supreme Court not in America's best interest", "image": "http://www.deseretnews.com/media/photos/web-1696147.jpg", "dsk": "opinion", "tout": {"article": {"id": 865654745}}, "thumbnail": "http://www.deseretnews.com/media/photos/web-1696147.jpg", "medium": "news", "description": "Hobbling the Supreme Court for up to a year with an unfilled vacancy is not in America's best interest.", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"admins": 683545112, "app_id": 320112201431112, "pages": 16317479654}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-21T00:00-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=1024, initial-scale=0.1", "GOOGLEBOT": "ARCHIVE", "og": {"url": "http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865654745/In-our-opinion-Divided-8-judge-Supreme-Court-not-in-Americas-best-interest.html?pg=all", "type": "article", "image": "http://img.deseretnews.com/images/article/hires/1696147/1696147.jpg", "site_name": "DeseretNews.com", "title": "In our opinion: Divided 8-judge Supreme Court not in America's best interest"}, "author": "Deseret News", "dateModified": "2016-05-21", "articleid": 865654745}, "article_summary": "The result is a situation where such deadlocks are making the Supreme Court increasingly unable to adequately fulfill its constitutional responsibilities.\n\"The court expresses no view on the merits of the cases.\u201d So said the United States Supreme Court as it unanimously sent a group of cases challenging the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate back to the lower courts.\nThe practical outcome of that decision may prove to be a boon to religious liberty, but a Supreme Court with only eight justices has the potential to create a great deal of problems going forward.\nThe Supreme Court may not always issue decisions with which Congress, republicans, or even this newspaper will agree, but the court's constitutional authority deserves more respect than it is currently being afforded.\nThe death of Justice Antonin Scalia, who was perhaps the most conservative justice at the time of his passing, has left the High Court with four Republican appointees and four Democratic appointees."}
