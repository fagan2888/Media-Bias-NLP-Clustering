Emphasis is mine.\n\nHillary Clinton appears to have established multiple email addresses for her private use, and possibly the use of her aides, under the domain of \u201cclintonemail.com,\u201d according to a prominent member of the hacking community who supplied independent research data, conducted with high-tech tools, to Fox News.\n\n\n\nThe hacker used an open-source tool, publicly available, called \u201cThe Harvester\u201d to search a variety of data sources \u2013 including well-known platforms such as Google, Bing, LinkedIn, Twitter and others \u2013 for any stored references to email addresses seen using a particular domain, in this case clintonemail.com.\n\n\n\nThe application of The Harvester to clintonemail.com revealed additional email addresses besides the one that Clinton aides have insisted publicly that she used, and have said was the only one that she used, when she served as Secretary of State: namely, hdr22@clintonemail.com.\n\n\n\nA screen grab of The Harvester\u2019s findings provided to Fox News by the source in the hacker community \u2013 whose professional resume also boasts extensive experience in the U.S. intelligence community \u2013 lists rather similar, but nonetheless different, email addresses, including hdr@clintonemail.com, hdr18@clintonemail.com, hdr19@clintonemail.com, hdr20@clintonemail.com, and hdr21@clintonemail.com.\n\n\n\nAlso unearthed by the hacking tool were email addresses of a slightly varied structure, including h.clinton@clintonemail.com, Hillary@clintonemail.com, contact@clintonemail.com, and mau_suit@clintonemail.com.\n\nThe White House and State Department have made multiple attempts this week to defend Clinton's use of personal email, but according to a new report from ABC News, Clinton was in direct violation of State Department policy for six years.\n\nA senior State Department official tells ABC News that under rules in place while Clinton was secretary of state, employees could only use private email accounts for official business if they turned those emails over to be entered into government computers. They were also forbidden from including sensitive but unclassified information on private email, except under some very narrow exceptions.\n\n\n\nThis policy is still in place, according to the Department. Until any private emails are entered into government computers, the official says, an employee is in violation of the rules.\n\n\n\nAnd perhaps the worst part of this entire scandal is the fact that Clinton put her own desires to avoid scrutiny and evade federal records laws about the national security of the United States by communicating sensitive information on an unsecure, personal server.\n\nSecurity researcher Dave Kennedy of TrustedSec agrees: \u201cIt was done hastily and not locked down.\u201d Mediocre encryption from Clinton\u2019s outbox to a recipient (or vice versa) would leave all of her messages open to bulk collection by a foreign government or military. Or, if someone were able to copy the security certificate Clinton used, they could execute what\u2019s called a \u201cman in the middle\u201d attack, invisible eavesdropping on data. \u201cIt\u2019s highly likely that another person could simply extract the certificate and man in the middle any user of the system without any warnings whatsoever,\u201d Hansen said.\n\n\n\nThe invalid certificate would have also likely left Clinton vulnerable to widespread internet bugs like \u201cHeartbleed,\u201d which was only discovered last spring, and may have let hackers copy the entire contents of the Clinton servers\u2019 memory. Inside that memory? Who knows: \u201cIt could very well have been a bunch of garbage,\u201d said Hansen, or \u201cit could have been her full emails, passwords, and cookies.\u201d Heartbleed existed unnoticed for years. A little social engineering, Hansen said, could give attackers access to Clinton\u2019s DNS information, letting them route and reroute data to their own computers without anyone realizing. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly small group of people who know how to do that,\u201d Hansen noted, but \u201cit\u2019s not hard\u2014it\u2019s just a lot of steps.\u201d\n\nAs the Washington Post editorial board stated yesterday in an op-ed, this situation goes far beyond the use of email and Clinton has destroyed (for now at least) the public trust.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Breach. .05/26/2016 2:29:15AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Breach.", "title": "Katie Pavlich - Report: Hillary Clinton Had Multiple Private Email Accounts on Server Used For State Department Business", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/03/06/report-hillary-clinton-had-multiple-private-email-accounts-used-for-state-department-business-n1966632", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/207/2014-06-13T004730Z_1_LYNXMPEA5C00Y_RTROPTP_3_USA.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Breach.", "title": "Katie Pavlich - Report: Hillary Clinton Had Multiple Private Email Accounts on Server Used For State Department Business", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/03/06/report-hillary-clinton-had-multiple-private-email-accounts-used-for-state-department-business-n1966632", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/207/2014-06-13T004730Z_1_LYNXMPEA5C00Y_RTROPTP_3_USA.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Report: Hillary Clinton Had Multiple Private Email Accounts on Server Used For State Department Business, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd30df\"", "article_summary": "As Hillary Clinton continues to dodge questions about why she conducted all of her State Department correspondence through a private email account, a new report from Fox News' James Rosen shows the former Secretary had many private email accounts on a server run from her Chappaqua, New York home.\nThey were also forbidden from including sensitive but unclassified information on private email, except under some very narrow exceptions.\nThe White House and State Department have made multiple attempts this week to defend Clinton's use of personal email, but according to a new report from ABC News, Clinton was in direct violation of State Department policy for six years.\nAlso unearthed by the hacking tool were email addresses of a slightly varied structure, including h.clinton@clintonemail.com, Hillary@clintonemail.com, contact@clintonemail.com, and mau_suit@clintonemail.com.\nA senior State Department official tells ABC News that under rules in place while Clinton was secretary of state, employees could only use private email accounts for official business if they turned those emails over to be entered into government computers."}
