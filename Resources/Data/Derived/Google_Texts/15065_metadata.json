The 7,600-store chain of CVS Caremark Corp. decided to forgo $2B in annual revenues by dropping the sale of cancer-causing cigarettes, cigars and smokeless tobacco in a bold strike against the rank hypocrisy connected with selling life-saving medicines and peddling agents of disease and death.\n\nMerlo on CBS Feb. 5. Merlo on CBS Feb. 5. Former pharmacist and CVS CEO Larry Merlo, who took the helm in 2011, hit the right note, saying: \u201cCigarettes have no place in an environment where healthcare is being delivered.\u201d His decision comes as CVS is repositioning from a drug store to a healthcare company, a shift facilitated by ObamaCare. The American Cancer Society lauded Merlo\u2019s gutsy move. The decision, according to ACS CEO John Seffrin, is \u201can important new development in the fight to save lives from the devastating effects of tobacco use.\u201d He applauded CVS Caremark, which uses Edelman for PR, for its \u201cleadership and strongly encourage other industry leaders to follow suit.\u201d Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. About 160,000 Americans died from it in 2013, according to an estimate by the ACS. Nearly 230,000 Americans were diagnosed with lung cancer during the past year. The hope is that Merlo\u2019s leadership shames Walgreens, which markets itself \u201cat the corner of happy and healthy,\u201d Rite Aid and Wal-Mart into following his lead. AT&T, a long-time sponsor of the U.S. Olympic Committee, took a stand for human rights with support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality just ahead of tomorrow\u2019s opening gala of the Sochi Olympics. The phone company blasted Russia\u2019s recently passed draconian law that bans \u201cpropaganda of non-traditional sexual relations.\u201d AT&T on February 4 released a statement that calls the measure harmful to LGBT individuals and families and a diverse society. AT&T wants \u201cto be on the record with our support for the LGBT community, and we hope that others involved with the Olympic Games will do the same.\u201d Ma Bell celebrates \u201cthe diversity of all Olympic athletes, their fans, Russian residents and all people the world over, including and, especially, our employees and their loved ones.\u201d Much of what passes these days for CSR is nothing more than washed-over pablum. CVS and AT&D did more than talk the talk. They walked the walk. Congratulations to Merlo and AT&T chief Randall Stephenson for showing the world that Big Business can be a force for good.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "CVS and AT&T have kicked 2014 off in fine fashion, making bold moves on the corporate social responsibility front.", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "/images/favicons/favicon-may2016-144.png", "keywords": "CSR, CVS, tobacco, AT&T", "GOOGLEBOT": "NOARCHIVE"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a02\"", "article_summary": "CVS and AT&T have kicked 2014 off in fine fashion, making bold moves on the corporate social responsibility front.\nCongratulations to Merlo and AT&T chief Randall Stephenson for showing the world that Big Business can be a force for good.\nCVS and AT&D did more than talk the talk.\nAT&T, a long-time sponsor of the U.S. Olympic Committee, took a stand for human rights with support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality just ahead of tomorrow\u2019s opening gala of the Sochi Olympics.\nThe hope is that Merlo\u2019s leadership shames Walgreens, which markets itself \u201cat the corner of happy and healthy,\u201d Rite Aid and Wal-Mart into following his lead."}
