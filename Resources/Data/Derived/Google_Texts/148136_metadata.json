If that fills you with dread, you\u2019re not alone.\n\nAmericans are pretty sick of government, elections, and politics these days. Trust in the federal government reached a record low (13 percent) last year and currently sits around 20 percent. Approval of Congress is abysmal, hitting its own record low (9 percent) before bouncing back to a still-pitiful 14 percent. This disdain is based as much on what Congress isn\u2019t doing as what it is doing: Political scientists have found that Congress has tackled only about one-quarter of major national issues via legislation.\n\nWe also know that the political parties have never been more ideologically polarized than they are today. Is it any surprise that public opinion polls consistently register frustration?\n\nRecent trends in political engagement are concerning. The 2014 midterm election saw turnout hit a 72-year low, with just 36 percent of eligible voters casting a ballot. Amazingly, while congressional approval was about 9 percent at the time, 97 percent of incumbents were re-elected to Congress in 2014. Perhaps our system is broken. Something is clearly wrong.\n\nIn a new book, my co-author and I make the case that although there may be widespread dissatisfaction with politics and the electoral process, our system isn\u2019t really broken. As Americans, we already have the power to fix what\u2019s wrong within the institutional setup and framework of the existing system.\n\nWhat\u2019s missing today is consistent and meaningful participation in politics. Citizens need to start taking full advantage of the tools that our system of government offers to produce the outcomes they desire. The beauty of a democracy is that citizens have the ability to govern themselves \u2014 to select and remove their representatives, to come together to solve collective problems, and to voice their ideas and opinions.\n\nYet, in the United States, most citizens routinely bypass opportunities to participate in elections and politics.\n\nAccording to a recent survey, in 2012:\n\n\u00bb 3 percent of Americans volunteered for a party/candidate.\n\n\u00bb 6 percent attended a political meeting/rally/speech.\n\n\u00bb 11 percent gave money to an individual running for public office.\n\n\u00bb 18 percent attended a local government meeting.\n\n\u00bb 24 percent signed a petition of some sort.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the place where we perform \u201cbest\u201d is presidential elections. In 2012, turnout in the presidential election was 58 percent. Voter turnout in local elections across the U.S. averages 25 percent. The recent mayoral election in Green Bay saw turnout of just 31 percent. Low turnout rates like those seen in municipal elections are especially concerning if the preferences of those who vote are not representative of the rest of the population.\n\nTaken together, these statistics don\u2019t paint a picture of a vibrant and engaged democracy. I would argue that when citizens aren\u2019t active players in the political process \u2014 when they aren\u2019t there to monitor what\u2019s going on, to hold elected officials accountable, and to express their preferences \u2014 it\u2019s not surprising that many of the problems we experience continue unabated or even worsen over time.\n\n\n\nWithdrawing from politics when things \u201cget bad,\u201d as people seem to be doing right now, isn\u2019t going to help. Although people may withdraw because they perceive the system to be flawed, it is more likely that the system is flawed because too many citizens have withdrawn. It\u2019s a vicious cycle, but it\u2019s hard to imagine America\u2019s most pressing problems being addressed without clear cues \u2014 intense participation, strong public opinion \u2014 as to which issues matters most.\n\nIn the future, citizens will have to take the lead in resolving the things they think are so bad about American elections and politics. They have the tools. There are dozens of ways to get involved. In order to get what they want out of elected officials and government, Americans are going to have to take action \u2014 in spite of the negative views they have about what\u2019s going on right now.\n\nAaron Weinschenk is assistant professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay.
