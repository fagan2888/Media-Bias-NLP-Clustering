He is presenting himself as a necessary liaison between the campus and the city at large. In a newly redrawn district that is now about 86% students, that could make the difference in November.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been nice to see more students in the last few years join commissions,\u201d Barry said. \u201cI can\u2019t pretend I\u2019m as connected to the campus as I was a few years ago, but I think what I can offer as a candidate is an understanding of the perspective of being a student, but also a broader perspective on the city. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard a lot of students say they want \u2014 to feel like they have a conduit in City Hall, and a pathway to getting involved.\u201d\n\nBarry, a spokesman for the insurance company Blue Shield, was still an undergraduate student himself when he first got involved with city politics. As an editor for the Daily Californian, he covered city meetings and got to know the council members. With Mayor Tom Bates\u2019 blessing, Barry applied to sit on the Waterfront Commission (since merged with Parks), which he later chaired.\n\nCouncilman Daryl Moore later appointed Barry to the Planning Commission and to the Community Health Commission, where he was elected vice chair and wrote an item that would raise awareness of Covered California eligibility. It was passed unanimously by the council.\n\n\u201cMy orientation on that commission has been finding items that can go to the council, get passed, and have an immediate impact,\u201d Barry said.\n\nBarry\u2019s platform, detailed on his website, emphasizes three priorities in the district, and three in the city. He wants to tackle the growing scarcity of affordable housing near campus, beginning by raising awareness of existing tenant protections in Berkeley. Barry referred to the new housing development downtown as \u201cpositive momentum.\u201d\n\nBarry said he would also address public safety in the district that contains the city\u2019s second highest crime area. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue of building trust between the campus community and Berkeley police,\u201d he said, explaining that many crimes \u2014 especially sexual assault among students \u2014 go unreported because of a lack of awareness or confidence in the process.\n\nThe third piece of Barry\u2019s district-specific platform is the revitalization of Telegraph Avenue. He wants to loosen restrictions on types of businesses permitted in the commercial district, and pointed to Peet\u2019s Coffee as a project that had overwhelming support yet required exemptions from multiple city ordinance quotas in order to open.\n\n\u201cA filled store front is better than a vacancy,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been some positive developments in terms of allowing for additional density both on the corridor and in the current district. So, adding some housing units and adding office units, building foot traffic so you have a base clientele for these often very small businesses.\u201d\n\nBarry\u2019s triple-pronged citywide plan includes forging partnerships with health nonprofits, working to boost job opportunities in the city by supporting corporations such as Bayer that offer apprenticeships to students, and harnessing student energy to ensure that the city meets the Climate Action Plan goals.\n\n\u201cSo many people who live in this district don\u2019t drive, and live close to where they go to school and shop,\u201d Barry said. \u201cThose things can contribute toward these goals, and hopefully we can help to advance that through things like solar financing, and doing a better job at meeting Zero Waste goals.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the only other candidate vying for the seat is Worthington, who has said in the past that he would drop out of the race if a progressive UC Berkeley student wanted to replace him.\n\n\u201cIf none of the progressive students that I think are qualified are going to be a candidate, then I am preparing to jump in,\u201d Worthington said.\n\nThe incumbent said both the endorsements Barry has made and those he\u2019s received \u201cindicate that he supports a certain brand,\u201d which Worthington referred to as \u201cthe pro-landlord and pro-Chamber of Commerce side of Berkeley politics.\u201d\n\nBarry has the support of Bates and Council Members Moore, Laurie Capitelli, Susan Wengraf, and Gordon Wozniak. Barry has also endorsed Worthington\u2019s former opponent George Beier, who is running in District 8, along with numerous other candidates.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have an awful lot to say about him,\u201d Worthington said. \u201cNobody that I\u2019ve talked to has seen him out there taking a strong stand for major issues.\u201d\n\nSafeena Mecklai, last year\u2019s Associated Students of University of California External Affairs Vice President, begged to differ.\n\n\u201cSean\u2019s been really proactive about reaching out to student leaders and hearing their thoughts about how he should move forward,\u201d said Mecklai, who served on the Health Commission with Barry last year.\n\nShe said his platform addresses students\u2019 major concerns.\n\n\u201cQuestions about what students want are often answered by non-students,\u201d Mecklai said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s important for students to get a more vocal representation when it comes to business on telegraph, especially when it comes to what kinds of businesses are brought in, but also lighting, safety and cleanliness.\u201d\n\nMecklai was involved in the creation of the Berkeley Student District Campaign (BSDC) redistricting map, which a judge approved in April after a protracted and bitter battle. The map does not stray significantly from the previous district boundaries, but includes more students. The district now stretches south from Hearst Street, and has an eastern boundary on Piedmont Avenue, encompassing most of the Greek system, Southside student residences, and parts of the Willard and LeConte neighborhoods.\n\nAn intern in Worthington\u2019s office created an alternate map that included additional student housing areas, including the International House, and some typically progressive coops and neighborhoods that are excluded from the BSDC map.\n\n\u201cI was supportive of the Berkeley Student District Campaign, and I think it\u2019s a good outcome of that process,\u201d Barry said. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to keep in mind that there are more students than you could possibly fit in one district map.\u201d\n\nBarry said he won\u2019t comment on the major differences between his and Worthington\u2019s politics and platforms until it is clear who the final candidates are.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably premature to make any comparative statements,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he stressed his connection to Cal students.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not running because I want to do this for 20 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a young district. At a certain point, I would want to pass it on to somebody else who was younger and ready to take the torch and run with it. I\u2019m doing this now because I think it\u2019s an opportunity in this district at this time.\u201d\n\nIf Barry is elected, he would be the youngest member of the current City Council. Jesse Arregu\u00edn was 24 when he was elected to the council and Nancy Skinner was 25, and still a student, when she was elected in 1984.\n\nRead Berkeleyside\u2019s coverage to date about the November 2014 elections\n\nWould you like a digest of the day\u2019s Berkeley news in your inbox at the end of your working day?
