Schwartz states: \u201cThe one apparent bright spot in Friday\u2019s report\u2014a sharp drop in the unemployment rate to 6.7 percent from 7 percent\u2014was tarnished because it largely resulted from people exiting the work force rather than because they landed jobs. The work force shrank by 347,000 in December, reversing a big gain from November, and returning the proportion of Americans in the labor force to its October level of 62.8 percent, the lowest in 35 years.\u201d He points out: \u201cAreas of the economy that had been healthy for most of 2013 reversed course as the year drew to a close, significantly cutting into overall job creation.\u201d Schwartz concludes: \u201cEmployment is still about two million below where it was when the recession started.\u201d\n\nWith even the friendlies firing shots at the \u201cdisastrous unemployment number,\u201d the White House tried to get out in front of the story by holding a Tuesday, January 14, meeting with the Cabinet, where President Obama aimed to pick up \u201cthe pace of his jobs message.\u201d According to the Associated Press (AP), White House senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer sent out an email Tuesday morning to the White House list of supporters claiming: \u201cThe president will use every tool he can to create jobs and opportunities for the middle class.\u201d The AP article highlights Obama\u2019s \u201cdetermination to use the power of executive orders and administrative actions . . . to help advance his agenda.\u201d\n\nWhile I oppose this administration\u2019s fondness for skirting Congress through the use of executive orders, here\u2019s a case where an \u201cexecutive order or administrative action\u201d could really help \u201cpick up the pace of the jobs message.\u201d\n\nIf President Obama truly wanted to \u201ccreate jobs and opportunities for the middle class,\u201d he could tell the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) to work with\u2014instead of against\u2014people and companies who are ready to risk their capital in the development of our natural resources and create jobs.\n\nWhile I am sure my readers could cite many similar stories, this one involves mining and mules. I have addressed this specific case three times before\u2014first, July 2010, when the USFS approved the \u201cPlan of Operation\u201d for the Finley Basin Exploration Project in Montana.\n\nMy first column on this provides thorough details and I encourage you to read it, as you will be appalled by how the USFS works\u2014and now, three and a half years later, it has only gotten worse.\n\nBack in the \u201870s Union Carbide drilled several exploration holes on the site, \u201cwhich is rated as having moderate to high mineral potential for the majority of the area.\u201d It is believed that there is a minimum of $250 million in tungsten\u2014which we currently import from China\u2014and that the site also has potential copper, silver, molybdenum, and gold.\n\nAt the time I originally addressed this project, an Australian company wanted to invest in America, bring outside dollars in, and create jobs by exploring and developing the Finley Claims. But the USFS was so difficult to work with, after spending more that $500,000 over two years, the company finally packed up and went home.\n\nThe June 10, 2010, \u201cDecision Memo\u201d states that in order to explore the previously drilled sites, miners will have to \u201cuse a team of mules\u201d and that \u201chand tools will be used to level the drilling pad and clear rocks, debris and any small shrubs.\u201d Additionally, \u201call disturbances would be reclaimed using hand tools.\u201d\n\nReading the Decision Memo, one gets the feeling that the USFS would rather not approve the mining proposal, but there were no real grounds not to. While explaining the \u201crationale\u201d for the decision, the memo states that the company has the \u201clegal right to conduct exploration activities\u201d and that \u201cThe role of the Forest Service is to ensure that mining activities minimize adverse environmental effects. Congress has not given the Forest Service authority to unreasonably circumscribe or prohibit reasonably necessary activities under the 1872 General Mining Law that are otherwise lawful.\u201d\n\nAfter the Australians left, the 276 claims were purchased by experienced miners. Together, the partners in Finley Mining Inc. have more than 80 years experience in mining\u2014with one having expertise in permitting and exploration and the other in project development and production.\n\nBecause the whole mule idea was unfeasible for the size and weight of the required equipment, the new owners submitted a revised Plan of Operations that allowed for use of the existing road Union Carbide built in the \u201870s. Despite the \u201cInventoried Roadless Area\u201d designation, the old road is regularly used by off-highway vehicles for recreation. The road is totally usable and doesn\u2019t require any construction. Yet, the USFS is treating the road as \u201cnew construction\u201d and therefore denied the plan. The experienced partners have, in the past two-and-a-half years, now submitted five different plans of operation. Each time, the USFS comes back with some new ridiculous questions, such as: \u201cIn what order do you plan to drill the holes?\u201d\n\nThe frequent excuse revolves around the various regulations\u2014complying with the National Environmental Policy Act, Federal Land Management and Policy Act, and other Environmental Protection Agency rules and regulations. The USFS Specialists claim they are underfunded and understaffed and are unable to do the processes required before granting a permit.\n\nMeanwhile, to hold the claims, these potential job creators, have to pay $40,000 a year to the Bureau of Land Management. They have spent more than $200,000 for applications, preparing the Plan of Operations, and on consultants and are no further along than they were three-plus years ago.\n\nSince the USFS doesn\u2019t have the staff or the budget to comply with the law, despite the hundreds of thousands of dollars they\u2019ve already taken in on this one project, Finley Mining Inc. has offered to hire approved contractors who can do the needed surveys.\n\nThe Mining Act of 1872, as revised, lays out the rules and regulations in which exploration and production on federal lands can be conducted and does allow for mining activity within Inventoried Roadless Areas\u2014as the original Decision Memo acknowledges. Access cannot be denied to someone who has a claim. Yet, access is denied.\n\nThis one project would employ 10 people in the initial exploration phase. Assuming the resource proves up, as the original drilling on these sites indicated, more drilling will take place and, in addition to the drill site workers, biologists, engineers, economists, and geologists will be needed for analysis. If all goes as expected, Finley Mining Inc. projects a minimum of 300 people would be hired for the construction and mining phases. The nearby Stillwater Mining has 1,740 employees.\n\nIf the USFS encouraged expansion, rather than simply interpreting and enforcing regulations, and managed the forest for the multiple use their mission mandates, the 300 construction workers could now be receiving a paycheck and paying taxes. Instead, we have policy-induced poverty.\n\nIf President Obama is serious about using \u201cevery tool he can to create jobs and opportunities for the middle class,\u201d instead of appointing a new commission or doing a study, he\u2019d issue an administrative action telling the USFS to comply with the law, to process permits within the 30 days required, and sign off on the Plan of Operations when it meets the existing requirements.\n\nOn Wednesday, January 15, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) spoke at a forum on U.S. energy policy. He addressed the Keystone pipeline, saying that the president\u2019s \u201cdelay in deciding the pipelines fate\u201d is making it \u201charder for a Democrat to defend some of the Washington Democrat\u2019s agenda.\u201d According to the Real Clear Politics report, He also \u201ccriticized Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid for failing to call a vote on EPA regulation reforms\u201d and is trying to \u201cget Harry to look at the hard-rock mining.\u201d\n\nYes, if Obama wants to use \u201cevery tool he can to create jobs and opportunities for the middle class,\u201d he has plenty of them. The Finley Basin is an easy one. So is approving the Keystone pipeline.\n\nUnfortunately for America\u2019s un\u2014and under\u2014employed, reality tells us that the January 14 promise is just more hyperbole, more campaign-style platitudes.
