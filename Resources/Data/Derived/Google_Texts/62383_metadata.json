For the next year, GPO will test the site and solicit feedback before GovInfo officially replaces the Federal Digital System in 2017.\n\nCalling it \"the Google for government documents,\" GPO CTO Richard Davis told FCW that the new site was designed with security and usability in mind.\n\nGovInfo will host the Congressional Record, the Federal Register, U.S. court opinions and more, and its responsive design will enhance access from mobile devices.\n\nGPO Program Manager Lisa LaPlant offered an example: When users search under the Affordable Care Act, results will include draft copies of the legislation, the actual law, citations, relevant U.S. code entries and more.\n\nThe site will use the Apache Solr open-source search engine, which will run in a GPO data center rather than via the cloud and will be secured using the encrypted HTTPS protocol.\n\nDavis noted the importance of preserving trust in government digital documents and the threat of data manipulation, and added that GPO has used digital signatures to authenticate documents since 2009.\n\n\"I think that's been a very important initiative that's carrying forward with the new site,\" he said.\n\nHe also noted that after two years of development, GovInfo is gearing up to launch with an annual price tag of roughly $7 million. That's the same amount of money GPO spent on its first digital portal back in 1994, before adjusting for inflation.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "FCW,federal computer week, government technology news, fcw, fcw.com, federal computer weekly, federal computer week magazine, federal computer news, federal computer, federal weekly, fcw daily, fed 100, federal 100, fed 100 awards, federal 100 awards, fed 100 winners, rising star awards, government employment news, federal cio, chief information officer, chief technology officer, government executive, federal executive, fisma, vivek kundra, Federal 100 awards, white house, obama, NSPS, security clearance, gpo, sbinet, nmci, recovery.gov, intellipedia, conflicker, future combat systems, registered traveler, homeland security, e-verify, dhs, homeland security, cybersecurity, gsa, alliant, fisma, cyber command, nmci, kelman, fcw insider, john klossner, dod techipedia, cloud computing, virtualization, dod cyber command, fdcc compliance, disa, ngen navy, grants.gov, dhs eagle ii, forge.mil, fose, telework, government 2.0, obama", "og": {"url": "https://fcw.com/articles/2016/02/03/gpo-site-rebrand.aspx", "image": "https://fcw.com/~/media/GIG/FCWNow/Topics/Records%20Management/digital_record_management.jpg", "site_name": "FCW", "description": "Released for a year of beta testing, GovInfo aims to provide a user-centered portal for accessing federal publications online.", "title": "Government documents portal gets a major facelift -- FCW"}, "description": "Released for a year of beta testing, GovInfo aims to provide a user-centered portal for accessing federal publications online."}, "article_summary": "Citizen ServicesGovernment documents portal gets a major faceliftThe Government Publishing Office launched a beta test of its new documents portal, GovInfo, on Feb. 3.\nCalling it \"the Google for government documents,\" GPO CTO Richard Davis told FCW that the new site was designed with security and usability in mind.\nThat's the same amount of money GPO spent on its first digital portal back in 1994, before adjusting for inflation.\nDavis noted the importance of preserving trust in government digital documents and the threat of data manipulation, and added that GPO has used digital signatures to authenticate documents since 2009.\nFor the next year, GPO will test the site and solicit feedback before GovInfo officially replaces the Federal Digital System in 2017."}
