Thornton police arrested two men Sunday morning after a chase that ended when the stolen pickup truck they were driving struck two police cars injuring two officers.

Arrested were Nathan Wallace, 32, who drove the pickup truck, and passenger Richard Arnold, 27.

Sgt. Matt Cabot said a passerby noticed a pickup truck backed up to the 8000 Liquor Store at 2683 E. 120th Ave.

The passerby followed the truck to a Taco Bell drive through, where a second man got in.

“At that time, the citizen noticed that one of the males had what appeared to be a gun in his waistband,” Cabot said in a release.

Police tried to initiate a traffic stop on the truck near 128th Avenue and Quebec Street, but the people in the truck sped away, and the chase was terminated.

The pursuit picked up again as the suspects fled southbound onto Irma Drive.

The vehicle turned westbound onto East 104th Avenue, and officers executed a maneuver to stop the truck.

During the maneuver, the driver intentionally rammed one police car, injuring the officer.

The vehicle then sideswiped and attached itself to a police car, injuring a second officer.

At that point, the vehicle was stopped and the occupants arrested.

A handgun was taken from the driver, and investigators determined that both the truck and gun were stolen.

Both injured officers were taken to a hospital, treated for their injuries, and released, Cabot said.

The suspects face charges of first-degree burglary, first-degree criminal trespassing and vehicular eluding, Cabot said.

Colorado Bureau of Investigation records show that Wallace has a criminal record that includes arrests for burglary, receiving stolen property and possession of a weapon by a felon.

Arnold’s record includes domestic violence, burglary, failure to appear, receiving stolen property and driving under the influence.
