Like rapper J. Cole, singer Lauryn Hill has used her music to express her frustration, anger and sorrow at the killing of unarmed black teen Michael Brown and the ongoing police brutality in Ferguson, Missouri. On Wednesday night, the Grammy Award-winning singer dedicated an “old sketch” of her song “Black Rage,” which she recorded in her living room. Pitchfork notes that she’s been performing this song, sung to the tune of “My Favorite Things,” since at least 2012. Sadly, it’s just as relevant in 2014, perhaps even more so.
