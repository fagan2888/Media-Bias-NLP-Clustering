Rucker caught a 22-yard pass from quarterback Connor Mitch during South Carolina\u2019s spring football game Saturday.\n\nOn a team with no proven quarterbacks and a dearth of tested receivers, it was somewhat appropriate that the first receiving touchdown of South Carolina\u2019s spring game was hauled in by a country music singer.\n\nThat was the case Saturday, when Charleston native and former Hootie and the Blowfish front man Darius Rucker burst from the Gamecocks bench and caught a 22-yard touchdown from Connor Mitch on the opening series of the Garnet and Black spring game at Williams-Brice Stadium. Head coach Steve Spurrier had promised a \u201cbig-time celebrity\u201d as the event\u2019s annual guest pass-catcher, and the top-selling country artist and avid Gamecocks fan certainly fit that bill.\n\n\u201cHe was fired up about it,\u201d Spurrier said. \u201cI said, \u2018Have you ever caught a touchdown at Williams-Brice?\u2019 He said, \u2018No, I\u2019d love to.\u2019 I said, \u2018I can make it happen for you.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn a team with so many question marks, Rucker\u2019s catch was the highlight of an exhibition the Black team won 14-13 after quarterback Michael Scarnecchia found Terry Googer in the end zone in the final seconds. Deebo Samuel had a 94-yard day to likely clinch the No. 2 wideout spot alongside All-American Pharoh Cooper, and linebacker Jasper Sasser had two interceptions. But the quarterback situation remained muddled on an afternoon when neither Mitch, Scarnecchia or Perry Orth was able to separate themselves from the rest.\n\nMitch, the No. 1 signal-called in spring practice, finished 10-of-16 for 183 yards and one touchdown \u2014 to Rucker, who wasn\u2019t exactly going to take a hit from a defensive back. Scarnecchia finished 12-of-19 for 191 yards, with one rushing score and the game-winning pass to Googer, set up by a 33-yard strike to Samuel. Perry Orth was 11-of-19 for 137 yards, and both interceptions.\n\n\u201cTheir stats are very similar every time we scrimmage,\u201d Spurrier said. \u201cI guess that\u2019s the kind of team we are right there.\u201d\n\nScarnecchia didn\u2019t hurt himself on a final drive that included a 23-yard pass to Jacob August, a 17-yarder to Darius Paulk, and the game-winner to Googer with 28 seconds left. \u201cThat was real nice. That was fun and exciting, especially for the team,\u201d he said. \u201cI enjoyed it because we ran the two-minute offense, and we didn\u2019t really work on it that much.\u201d\n\nBut he was up against a defense that ran two simple coverages and wasn\u2019t allowed to blitz. Spurrier added that Scarnecchia is sometimes too inclined to run with the ball rather continue through his progressions. And he reiterated that the quarterback competition won\u2019t be settled until preseason, by which time incoming freshman Lorenzo Nunez \u2014 in attendance Saturday as a spectator \u2014 will be in the mix.\n\n\u201cThey all did some good things,\u201d Spurrier said. \u201cLorenzo Nunez, he was here watching the scrimmage. He\u2019ll be ready to step into the competition as soon as he steps on campus in the summer. We\u2019re still trying to see if one guy is clearly better than the rest. ... We\u2019re always trying to figure out who the best player is, and if they\u2019re pretty close in ability, you play more than one. Simple as that. We\u2019ve still got a lot of time to find out who\u2019s our quarterback.\u201d\n\nCooper was on the field for the first snap, and then sat out the rest of the game. While a few other receivers like Googer, Carlton Heard and Shaq Davidson had their moments Saturday, Samuel appears to have separated himself. \u201cWe know he\u2019s going to play and Pharoh\u2019s going to play,\u201d Spurrier said, \u201c... but all these other guys are sort of in a wad right now.\u201d\n\nThe same could be said at quarterback, where the competition for the starting job against North Carolina on Sept. 3 could go right up until game week.\n\n\u201cI consider us all on equal ground,\u201d Scarnecchia said. \u201cThroughout the spring we\u2019ve all gotten a lot of equal reps. ... I think the competition, like Spurrier said, is not going to be set in stone unless someone separates themselves or it\u2019s the week before the game. So we\u2019ll have an opportunity to keep showcasing what we have and going out there, and working hard and trying to earn that spot.\u201d\n\nAnd they\u2019ll do it without Rucker, who until the final seconds looked like he\u2019d be the only person Saturday to catch a scoring pass. But give Mitch credit \u2014 his receiver may have been wide open, but the quarterback still had to make an adjustment on the fly.\n\n\u201cYesterday in meetings, coach Spurrier told me I was throwing it to Kenny Chesney,\u201d Mitch said. \u201cSo they called the play, and I\u2019m looking over for Kenny Chesney. I guess they kind of switched it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "At South Carolina\u2019s spring game, Rucker proved the biggest catch, Sports, \r\nSportssouthcarolina, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nrsssports, Darius Rucker,Gamecocks,SEC football,spring football,Steve Spurrier", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 On a team with no proven quarterbacks and a dearth of tested receivers, it was somewhat appropriate that the first receiving touchdown of South Carolina\u2019s spring game was hauled in by a country music singer.", "title": "At South Carolina\u2019s spring game, Rucker proved the biggest catch", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150411/150419822/at-south-carolina-x2019-s-spring-game-rucker-proved-the-biggest-catch", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150411/PC20/150419822/AR/0/AR-150419822.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150411/PC20/150419822/AR/0/AR-150419822.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 On a team with no proven quarterbacks and a dearth of tested receivers, it was somewhat appropriate that the first receiving touchdown of South Carolina\u2019s spring game was hauled in by a country music singer.", "title": "At South Carolina\u2019s spring game, Rucker proved the biggest catch", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150411/PC20/150419822/AR/0/AR-150419822.jpg?201504111724", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150419822}}, "keywords": "At South Carolina\u2019s spring game, Rucker proved the biggest catch , Sports, \r\nSportssouthcarolina, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nrsssports, Darius Rucker,Gamecocks,SEC football,spring football,Steve Spurrier", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-11T16:21:02Z", "modified_time": "2015-04-11T17:24:00Z", "author": "David Caraviello"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 On a team with no proven quarterbacks and a dearth of tested receivers, it was somewhat appropriate that the first receiving touchdown of South Carolina\u2019s spring game was hauled in by a country music singer."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b7c\"", "article_summary": "Rucker caught a 22-yard pass from quarterback Connor Mitch during South Carolina\u2019s spring football game Saturday.\nOn a team with no proven quarterbacks and a dearth of tested receivers, it was somewhat appropriate that the first receiving touchdown of South Carolina\u2019s spring game was hauled in by a country music singer.\nBut the quarterback situation remained muddled on an afternoon when neither Mitch, Scarnecchia or Perry Orth was able to separate themselves from the rest.\n1 signal-called in spring practice, finished 10-of-16 for 183 yards and one touchdown \u2014 to Rucker, who wasn\u2019t exactly going to take a hit from a defensive back.\nIn this 2014 file photo, Darius Rucker sports a USC cap as he performs for at the sold out North Charleston Coliseum."}
