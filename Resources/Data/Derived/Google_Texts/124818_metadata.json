Francis answered the prayer with a phone call, vowing to Benoka that \u201cI will never leave you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wrote to him that we are dying, we are suffering, I am afraid that his children, his little children are dying, please help them, help us,\u201d Benoka says.\n\n\u201cHe called me. He told me certainly, sure I am with you, I will [not] forget you, I will [do] all possible to help you.\u201d\n\nMore than a year after the phone call \u2014 near the anniversary of when Iraqi Christians, Yezidis and Shabaks of the Nineveh Plains were forced to flee their homelands \u2014 Benoka visited the United States for the first time, to coincide with Francis\u2019 arrival in America.\n\n>>>\u2018We Love This Land\u2019: Iraqi Christian Men Fight to Keep ISIS Away From Homes\n\nThe two were not to meet while they were here, but Benoka, who came to Washington, D.C., to lobby for financial and moral support for displaced Christians, closely followed Francis\u2019 message.\n\n\u201cHe is our father \u2014 he could go to places we cannot,\u201d Benoka, 37, told The Daily Signal in an interview Thursday.\n\n\u201cAs the messenger of the church, of the Christian persecuted, I hope he can defend us to the authorities. I hope, especially now in this great nation, in the U.S.A., he could [share] our message, to authorities here in Congress, the White House and U.N., to speak against our genocide, and to defend us here. That is our hope.\u201d\n\nToday, Benoka runs two clinics, where 60 staff members can provide services such as dental care, pediatric care, ultrasounds and even surgery.\n\nBut that is not enough. Benoka says there are some people too sick to serve. There is a shortage of medicine. It would also help to operate his clinic out of an actual building, not a tent, as he does now.\n\nMore than anything, Benoka would like to restore Iraq\u2019s rich Christian history. For that to happen, Iraq\u2019s Christians will have to overcome the greatest period of violence against them since the fall of the Ottoman Empire and World War I, 100 years ago.\n\n\u201cIt is very hard so see the suffering. We are losing them. The world is losing Christians from Iraq. That is a big loss for humanitarian heritage. Yes, we would like to live in peace and security. But we would also like to continue our culture. We are going to disappear.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Inspired by the spirit of Pope Francis, Father Behnam Benoka, an internally displaced Iraqi priest living in Erbil, hopes to save persecuted Christians.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Inspired by the spirit of Pope Francis, Father Behnam Benoka, an internally displaced Iraqi priest living in Erbil, hopes to save persecuted Christians.", "title": "Iraqi Priest Hopes for Pope to Help End \u2018Genocide\u2019 of Christians", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/IraqChristians.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-01T09:24:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QBHeHD"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Inspired by the spirit of Pope Francis, Father Behnam Benoka, an internally displaced Iraqi priest living in Erbil, hopes to save persecuted Christians.", "title": "Iraqi Priest Hopes for Pope to Help End \u2018Genocide\u2019 of Christians", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/IraqChristians.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "middle east", "published_time": "2015-09-24T20:28:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-01T09:24:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Iraq, Christian, Pope Francis, ISIS, Yezidi, internally displaced, refugee, Mosul, Kurdistan, terrorism"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b14\"", "article_summary": "Indeed, at his lowest moment last August, Benoka wrote a letter to Pope Francis, asking for love and blessings.\n\u201cHe is our father \u2014 he could go to places we cannot,\u201d Benoka, 37, told The Daily Signal in an interview Thursday.\nIt would also help to operate his clinic out of an actual building, not a tent, as he does now.\nThat is our hope.\u201dToday, Benoka runs two clinics, where 60 staff members can provide services such as dental care, pediatric care, ultrasounds and even surgery.\n\u201cAs the messenger of the church, of the Christian persecuted, I hope he can defend us to the authorities."}
