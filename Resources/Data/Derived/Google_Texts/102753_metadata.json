As an atheist.\n\nAnd not only that \u2014 the religion he abandoned is Islam.\n\nIn an interview with ESPN the Magazine released Thursday, Mr. Foster said he is fairly open about his atheism in his circles and gets some odd reactions.\n\n\u201cI get the devil-worship thing a lot. They\u2019ll ask me, \u2018You worship the devil?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018No, bro, I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a God, why would I believe there\u2019s a devil?\u2019 There\u2019s a lot of ignorance about non-belief.\u201d\n\nTodd Stiefel, the chairman of Openly Secular, says that as far as he knows, Mr. Foster is the first active roster member in the major U.S. pro-sports leagues to be openly atheistic.\n\nMr. Foster, 28, was raised Muslim, but abandoned that religion in high school.\n\n\u201cThis is unprecedented,\u201d Mr. Stiefel told ESPN. \u201cHe is the first active professional athlete, let alone star, to ever stand up in support of gaining respect for secular Americans.\u201d\n\nMr. Foster said he is confident that other players believe similarly, but they stay private about it because of potential flack from sponsors.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to ruin endorsements,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople might say, \u2018I don\u2019t want an atheist representing my team.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe running back, who injured his groin during training camp and is likely to miss a substantial chunk of the season, said his stardom immunizes him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m established in this league, and as I\u2019m digging deeper into myself and my truth, just being me is more important than being sexy to Pepsi or whoever,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter a while, what\u2019s an extra dollar compared to the freedom of being you? That\u2019s the choice I made.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by ESPN about the common practice of quarterbacks like Russell Wilson and Tim Tebow \u2014 not to speak of athletes in other sports \u2014 crediting God for victories, Mr. Foster said he thinks that \u201cweird.\u201d\u201cIf there is a God and he\u2019s watching football, there are so many other things he could be doing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are hungry children and diseases and famine and so much important stuff going on in the world, and he\u2019s really blessed your team? It\u2019s just weird to me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Houston Texans running back Arian Foster has come out of the closet.
