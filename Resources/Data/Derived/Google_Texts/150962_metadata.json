John Taggart for The Wall Street Journal\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife have put their Brooklyn home on the rental market for $4,975 a month, describing it in an ad as an \u201coasis in Park Slope.\u201d\n\nMr. de Blasio and his family moved to Gracie Mansion in Manhattan this summer and have been doing extensive work on their Brooklyn home ever since. The Brooklyn townhouse went on the market Thursday.\n\nIn the ad, the house is described as sporting a versatile layout with three bedrooms convertible to four. There are high ceilings on the parlor floor, rustic 12-inch wide plank floors, an original decorative marble mantle, exposed brick and two big custom closets.\n\n\u201cThe front landscaped garden of this sun-filled home leads to the original French door entryway,\u201d the ad reads. \u201cThe ground floor living room has newly refinished oak floors and a brick hearth with a hand painted tile hearthstone.\u201d\n\nThe eat-in kitchen has a new dishwasher, refrigerator and microwave. The garden is described as \u201cenchanting, landscaped, perennial and evergreen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIts designed in a multi-tiered flagstone fashion with a beautiful \u2018rose of sharon\u2019 and a mini-crabapple tree. Must see to appreciate!\u201d the ad says of the garden. \u201cYou\u2019ll also enjoy the convenience of the edible herb garden\u2026rosemary, thyme, sage!\u201d\n\nWhile the ad puts the house in the best light, Mr. de Blasio has long described it as \u201chumble.\u201d The home only has one bathroom\u2013and it is on the third floor\u2013and the family of four has described that feature as a challenge over the years.\n\nThe ad specifically prohibits pets and smoking, and stipulates that the tenant will be responsible for heat and hot water, gas and electric.\n\nIn an interview last month, the mayor said the house needed a lot of work because there had been more than a decade of deferred maintenance.\n\n\u201cOh, it just needed a lot because, you know, we were always leading such busy lives and we didn\u2019t get to focus a lot,\u201d he said of the renovations. \u201cThe floors need to be redone and painting. And it\u2019s just a lot of things that we thought from the beginning we should fix but we never got to. So, it\u2019s nice to have the chance to do it.\u201d\n\nLast November, Mr. de Blasio was elected to a four-year term that ends Dec. 31, 2017. If he runs for re-election, as is expected, and wins, he will have access to Gracie Mansion through December 2021.\n\nMr. de Blasio is the first mayor to live in Gracie Mansion in 12 years. His predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, chose to live in his townhouse on the Upper East Side.\n\nWhile Mr. de Blasio said he and the family are thrilled to live in Gracie Mansion, he said he expects to return to Brooklyn when his tenure at City Hall ends. It is unclear if he intends to return to the home he is now renting out, or another property.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as privilege to live in Gracie Mansion. It\u2019s an extraordinary place,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said last month. \u201cIt\u2019s not a home per se because it\u2019s something the public grants to you temporarily. But, you know, in terms of my home, I look forward to the day I return to Brooklyn permanently. And that\u2019s the only place I want to live.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife have put their Brooklyn home on the rental market for $4,975 a month, describing it in an ad as an \"oasis in Park Slope.\"", "title": "De Blasio\u2019s Brooklyn Home Goes on Rental Market", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/10/02/de-blasios-brooklyn-home-goes-on-rental-market/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EV088_nydebl_P_20141002101125.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "De Blasio\u2019s Brooklyn Home Goes on Rental Market", "description": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife have put their Brooklyn home on the rental market for $4,975 a month, describing it in an ad as an \"oasis in Park Slope.\"", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Michael Howard Saul", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife have put their Brooklyn home on the rental market for $4,975 a month, describing it in an ad as an \"oasis in Park Slope.\"", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-02T15:15:27-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/10/02/de-blasios-brooklyn-home-goes-on-rental-market/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-21743", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife have put their Brooklyn home on the rental market for $4,975 a month, describing it in an ad as an \"oasis in Park Slope.\"", "title": "De Blasio\u2019s Brooklyn Home Goes on Rental Market", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/10/02/de-blasios-brooklyn-home-goes-on-rental-market/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EV088_nydebl_P_20141002101125.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-21743", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-02T15:16:14-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c7d\"", "article_summary": "If he runs for re-election, as is expected, and wins, he will have access to Gracie Mansion through December 2021.\nBut, you know, in terms of my home, I look forward to the day I return to Brooklyn permanently.\nMr. de Blasio is the first mayor to live in Gracie Mansion in 12 years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s as privilege to live in Gracie Mansion.\nThe Brooklyn townhouse went on the market Thursday."}
