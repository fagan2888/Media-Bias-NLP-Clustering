Former Marine Eddie Ray Routh is charged with capital murder in the deaths of 38-year-old Chris Kyle and Kyle\u2019s friend, 35-year-old Chad Littlefield, two years ago at a luxury resort\u2019s shooting range in a rural area about 25 miles southeast of Stephenville. The trial is expected to start Wednesday.\n\nThe film \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d is based on Kyle\u2019s 2012 memoir. He left the Navy in 2009 after four tours in Iraq.\n\nJudge Jason Cashon told potential jurors during a jury qualification process last week that they wouldn\u2019t be dismissed just for seeing the movie or reading the book.\n\nInstead of a typical Erath County jury pool of 175, about 800 jury summonses were sent out, district clerk Wanda Pringle has said. Several hundred people who weren\u2019t eliminated due to exemptions or other factors took part in last week\u2019s screening. The group was narrowed during that process after potential jurors were dismissed for a variety of reasons, including some who said pretrial publicity had already led them to a decision in the case.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jury selection to start in \u2018American Sniper\u2019 slaying case", "author": "Jamie Stengle", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Jury selection to start in \u2018American Sniper\u2019 slaying case", "title": "Jury selection to start in \u2018American Sniper\u2019 slaying case", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/09/jury_selection_to_start_in_american_sniper_slaying_case/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/american-sniper-routh-trial.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jury selection to start in \u2018American Sniper\u2019 slaying case", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/american-sniper-routh-trial.jpeg5-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Jury selection to start in \u2018American Sniper\u2019 slaying case", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Jury selection to start in \u2018American Sniper\u2019 slaying case", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7d8f\"", "article_summary": "Judge Jason Cashon told potential jurors during a jury qualification process last week that they wouldn\u2019t be dismissed just for seeing the movie or reading the book.\nInstead of a typical Erath County jury pool of 175, about 800 jury summonses were sent out, district clerk Wanda Pringle has said.\nThe group was narrowed during that process after potential jurors were dismissed for a variety of reasons, including some who said pretrial publicity had already led them to a decision in the case.\nThe film \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d is based on Kyle\u2019s 2012 memoir.\nSeveral hundred people who weren\u2019t eliminated due to exemptions or other factors took part in last week\u2019s screening."}
