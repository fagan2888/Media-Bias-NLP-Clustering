The Eau Claire Sheriff's Department estimates between 800 and 1,000 people were on hand. Cruz was introduced by Gov. Scott Walker, who told the crowd he did not endorse Cruz because of his opposition to any other candidate, but because he believes the Texas senator is the best candidate.\n\nCruz promised the crowd \"We're going to repeal Obamacare, pass the flat tax, pull back the regulators, stop amnesty, and its going to generate millions and millions of new, high paying jobs. Wages rising all across America, that's going to generate trillions of new government revenue, and we will use that revenue to rebuild our military, so it remains the mightiest fighting force on the face of the planet.\"\n\nCruz drew frequent applause as he invoked the name of President Ronald Reagan, promising the crowd he would follow Reagan's model to rebuild America's economy.\n\nHe also promised to destroy \"radical Islamic terrorists\" and secure the nation's borders.\n\nOne of the guests at the Eau Claire rally was Senator Mike Lee of Utah. Cruz remarked \"wouldn't he look good in a robe?\", an apparent reference to future judicial appointments.\n\nCruz also praised Gov. Scott Walker, saying Walker inspired many around the nation by his fight against unions and special interests.\n\nPolls show Cruz with a comfortable lead over Donald Trump in Wisconsin.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Senator Ted Cruz of Texas packed Eau Claire's Florian Gardens Sunday night as he asked his supporters to help him win Wisconsin's primary on Tuesday.
