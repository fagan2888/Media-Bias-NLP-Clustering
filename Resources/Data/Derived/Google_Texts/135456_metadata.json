(Photo: Special to the Register)\n\nIowa's largest health insurer is teaming with hospital systems to offer new health coverage that organizers hope will provide efficient, effective care.\n\nWellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield leaders say the new plans' customers should include people with moderate incomes who are seeking federal subsidies from the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThose Iowans will finally be able to choose Wellmark plans next year \u2014 but their policies generally will only cover care at hospitals and clinics aligned with Mercy Health System, based in Des Moines, or the University of Iowa Health System in eastern Iowa.\n\nWellmark, the state\u2019s biggest health insurer, previously declined to sell policies on Iowa\u2019s version of the federal health insurance marketplace. The online system, which launched in 2013, is the only place to buy policies that qualify for subsidies. Wellmark leaders correctly predicted the marketplace would be plagued by bugs and hassles. But they say it\u2019s better now, and they\u2019re going to offer 2017 policies in 47 counties.\n\nThe new policies will be HMO plans that Wellmark will co-own with the Des Moines-based Mercy system and with the University of Iowa Health Alliance, which includes the Genesis system in the Quad Cities, Mercy Medical Center in Cedar Rapids and the Great River system in Burlington.\n\nThe new plans will be offered to people buying individual plans on or off the Obamacare marketplace and to small businesses. Organizers expect demand to build over several years, as the plans show results in holding down costs and providing good care.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really focused on keeping people well, instead of waiting for patients to show up in the emergency room,\u201d said Jennifer Vermeer, chief operating officer of the University of Iowa Health Alliance. Vermeer, the former chief of Iowa\u2019s Medicaid program, said the new arrangement will include innovative approaches. For example, she said, members of the UI plan will be able to use video-chat software on their phones or computers to talk with doctors about simple health matters for free.\n\nThe new plans will pay for some specialized care outside of the network, such as transplants or treatments of rare diseases not available at Mercy or the UI. Emergency care also will be covered at outside hospitals. But most care will only be covered if it's provided within one of the two networks.\n\nWellmark said the new plans will be up to 15 percent less expensive than its traditional open-network policies. They hope to expand the new plans to more counties as other clinics and hospitals agree to join. They also expect some large employers to show interest in offering the plans as options to their workers.\n\nSteven Kukla, a vice president for the Mercy system, said the new plans will be more customer-friendly than HMOs offered in the past. Mercy owned one of those plans for a few years in the early 1990s, but folded it. The new versions of HMOs are less restrictive, he said. For example, patients wanting to see medical specialists won\u2019t need referrals from primary care doctors if the specialists are within the network.\n\nKukla said the ownership arrangement means the hospital systems will have a direct stake in how well patients fare. The plans will make money if participants remain relatively well. Health coaches will help make that happen, he said. The HMOs will lose money if the patients receive unnecessary treatments and tests.\n\nJanis Van Ahn, an independent Johnston insurance agent who specialize in health policies, said Wellmark\u2019s approach makes sense. Wellmark is being careful in how much exposure it has to risk in the Obamacare marketplace, in which some other carriers have lost money, she said. \u201cThey\u2019re dipping their toe in the water,\u201d she said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1X4Eyrr", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "New plans' customers will include people buying on the Obamacare marketplace, where subsidies are available.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "New plans' customers will include people buying on the Obamacare marketplace, where subsidies are available.", "title": "Wellmark, hospitals to offer new HMOs", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2016/05/12/wellmark-hospitals-offer-new-hmos/84280590/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New plans' customers will include people buying on the Obamacare marketplace, where subsidies are available.", "title": "Wellmark, hospitals to offer new HMOs", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/44224f5f0693afc905a5e6496f73a3b8b5190d16/c=40-0-280-240&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/26/B9315289118Z.1_20141126212325_000+GES98LJV3.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Insurance industry", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Insurance industry", "title": "Wellmark, hospitals to offer new HMOs", "author": "Tony Leys", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/health", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3758d96facd4f719770352cb4aecabcd2314f9b2/c=70-0-250-240/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/26/B9315289118Z.1_20141126212325_000+GES98LJV3.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/80895fe4bbcd15d5ab1503ba862b9cc6f16fb435/c=40-0-280-240/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/26/B9315289118Z.1_20141126212325_000+GES98LJV3.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/361593a8f469527a579a5d5c1aed9a1efebd314e/c=0-0-320-240/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/26/B9315289118Z.1_20141126212325_000+GES98LJV3.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1ca279bd746624fe3d7650b89e93360733a876d1/c=0-30-320-210&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/26/B9315289118Z.1_20141126212325_000+GES98LJV3.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-05-12T14:56:40.133000-05:00", "shorthed": "Wellmark, hospitals to offer new HMOs", "articleid": 84280590, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9fabdbb4e71f847f2d443c07f31bc8951d7e48af/c=0-30-320-210/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/26/B9315289118Z.1_20141126212325_000+GES98LJV3.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9b53f8026c8841a9563b41fb2623239b2397abd9/c=92-0-227-240/local/-/media/DesMoines/2014/11/26/B9315289118Z.1_20141126212325_000+GES98LJV3.1-0.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3c2e\"", "article_summary": "Janis Van Ahn, an independent Johnston insurance agent who specialize in health policies, said Wellmark\u2019s approach makes sense.\nWellmark, the state\u2019s biggest health insurer, previously declined to sell policies on Iowa\u2019s version of the federal health insurance marketplace.\nSteven Kukla, a vice president for the Mercy system, said the new plans will be more customer-friendly than HMOs offered in the past.\nThose Iowans will finally be able to choose Wellmark plans next year \u2014 but their policies generally will only cover care at hospitals and clinics aligned with Mercy Health System, based in Des Moines, or the University of Iowa Health System in eastern Iowa.\nWellmark said the new plans will be up to 15 percent less expensive than its traditional open-network policies."}
