Colorado received the Pac-12’s annual Sportsmanship Award for its humanitarian efforts and resiliency in helping the university and Boulder community recover from the September flooding, CU announced Tuesday.

The award is bestowed by the Pac-12 Student-Athlete Advisory Committee.

“The way our student-athletes, coaches and staff responded during that difficult time was most rewarding to witness personally,” CU Athletic Director Rick George said in a news release.

“I had only been on campus a month and it really gave me a look at all the wonderful people we have in our program. They put aside their own concerns at the time to help out others in the community in numerous ways.”

CU chancellor Phil DeStefano said:

“I can’t express enough how proud I am of our student-athletes and their well-deserved award. Many of them sustained flood damage to their homes and lost their possessions. Yet amid their own distress, they stepped up for the community. Their generous acts brought feelings of solace to our community’s first responders and displaced residents.”

Colorado postponed and then rescheduled its athletics events of Sept. 14-15, including a home football game vs. Fresno State. The CU football team instead spend that day taking food that already had been delivered to the stadium and distributed it to those on campus that had been displaced by the rising waters of Boulder Creek.
