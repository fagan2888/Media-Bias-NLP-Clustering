Because they don\u2019t weigh a lot, you can put them on people and they don\u2019t get in the way.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re affordable and they\u2019re tough \u2013 I\u2019ve run them over and they still work. For sport, the cameras will capture a lot that normal TV cameras can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nWest Perth coach Bill Monaghan said the concept was worth investigating but he wanted GoPros used at every league game to ensure all WAFL clubs received the same scrutiny.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth exploring. Generally the more video analysis you have, the better,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Monaghan said GoPro footage could streamline the tribunal process.\n\n\u201cIf they can see it on vision, they will offer a player a penalty. If there\u2019s no vision, they\u2019ve got no choice but to go to tribunal. It\u2019d be great if every report had a piece of supporting vision with it,\u201d he said.\n\nWAFL umpire manager Darryl Sinclair said GoPro footage could benefit umpire training and coaching as well as catch out footy thugs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly keen to embrace new technology,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAny additional footage helps. This would give you another angle. It certainly could be handy.\u201d\n\nMr Alexander said innovations such as specialised cameras and GPS are \u201calready enhancing the spectator experience, providing real-time monitoring of athlete performance and, of course, helping officials with decision-making\u201d.\n\n\u201cSporting codes will make their own call about if and how the technology is applied (but) there\u2019s certainly benefit on a number of levels, including the potential for improved overall player conduct,\u201d Mr Alexander said.\n\nThe lack of WAFL footage came under the spotlight in 2011 when TV cameras covering West Coast Eagle Daniel Kerr\u2019s return from injury with East Fremantle caught him striking Claremont\u2019s Luke Blackwell.\n\nOrdinarily, news crews would not have covered the game and there would have been little or no footage of the incident.", "article_metadata": {"description": "FOOTBALL umpires in WA leagues should be equipped with tiny yet robust GoPro cameras to catch footy thugs in the act and stamp out on-field violence, experts and coaches say.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "PerthNow", "description": "FOOTBALL umpires in WA leagues should be equipped with tiny yet robust GoPro cameras to catch footy thugs in the act and stamp out on-field violence, experts and coaches say.", "title": "Call for WAFL umpires to wear cameras to stamp out on-field violence", "url": "http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/western-australia/call-for-wafl-umpires-to-wear-cameras-to-stamp-out-onfield-violence/story-fnhocxo3-1226875553591", "image": "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2014/04/05/1226875/553565-ba64d7bc-bbb5-11e3-ada0-f27aaeaffaeb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2014/04/05/1226875/553565-ba64d7bc-bbb5-11e3-ada0-f27aaeaffaeb.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@perthnow", "id": "@perthnow"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135447496484311}, "articleid": 1226875553591, "keywords": "director-general Ron Alexander, footy thugs, umpire manager, Recreation Director-General Ron, FOOTBALL umpires, on-field violence, waterproof cameras, ,East Fremantle,Western Australia,Australia, ,West Perth,Western Australia,Australia, ,Leederville,Western Australia,Australia, Department of Sport and Recreation, Jake Carlisle, Steven Morris, athlete performance, real-time monitoring, pre-season games, league game, spectator experience, off-the-ball incident, footage helps, worth investigating, tribunal process, player conduct, high-res video, Sporting codes, Ron Alexander, Jim Frater, Shane Stewart, Darryl Sinclair, Bill Monaghan, Nick Woodman", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sat Apr 05 18:47:50 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Sat Apr 05 18:47:50 EST 2014", "author": "TREVOR PADDENBURG"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb39f\"", "article_summary": "Call for WAFL umpires to wear cameras to stamp out on-field violenceFOOTBALL umpires in WA leagues should be equipped with tiny yet robust GoPro cameras to catch footy thugs in the act and stamp out on-field violence, experts and coaches say.\nWAFL umpire manager Darryl Sinclair said GoPro footage could benefit umpire training and coaching as well as catch out footy thugs.\nThe AFL trialled the technology with umpires wearing cameras strapped to their chests during pre-season games this year.\nHe said there was \u201ccertainly benefit\u201d in using cameras to stamp out on-field brutes.\nMr Monaghan said GoPro footage could streamline the tribunal process."}
