The drugs have a street value of $3 million.\n\nDetectives have flown to Queensland to speak to Mr Rogerson and have not ruled out further arrests.\n\nDetective Inspectors Mick Sheehy and Russell Oxford arrive at Brisbane Airport to question Roger Rogerson.

He had said he would return to NSW on Monday but did not catch the flight as planned, prompting officers to make the journey north.\n\nThe revelations come as a body wrapped in a blue tarpaulin \u2013 possibly that of Mr Gao \u2013 was found in the sea off Cronulla.\n\nThe body was floating about 2.5 kilometres off Shelly Beach, said Lachlan Steven, who spotted it at 7.30am while travelling from Sydney Harbour to Cronulla.\n\nCharged with murder: former detective Glen McNamara.

He saw two feet with \"white leather runners\" on.\n\nSources close to the investigation have told Fairfax Media the body \"fits\" with the events they allege happened about the time of Mr Gao's disappearance.\n\nThe University of Technology student was reported missing on Wednesday, 24 hours after he was joined by two others in meeting Mr McNamara and Mr Rogerson in the Padstow industrial area, police will allege.\n\nMissing student Jamie Gao.

His phone, keys and wallet were nearby.\n\nMr Gao is an only child from Hurstville; his mother was in Hong Kong when he went missing.\n\nOn Sunday, Superintendent Moore said the circumstances of Mr Gao's disappearance suggested foul play.\n\nHours later, Mr McNamara was pulled over during a traffic stop at Kyeemagh in Sydney's south and he was questioned overnight before being charged with murder and drug offences.\n\nMr Rogerson, 73, was a decorated senior police officer until he shot and killed drug dealer Warren Lanfranchi in 1981.\n\nHe was twice convicted for lying in court and served two separate jail terms.\n\nHe was later accused of supplying drugs, assault, bribery and conspiring to murder, but was never convicted.\n\nMr McNamara is a former investigator with the National Crime Authority and the NSW police; he was a detective stationed in Kings Cross and in Sydney's south. He gave evidence to the NSW police royal commission about alleged police protection of paedophiles.\n\nMr McNamara's Cronulla home has been searched by police and a blue Ford Falcon XR6 was seized from his premises.\n\nMr Rogerson's Padstow Heights home was also searched and a car, a silver Ford Falcon, was taken away.\n\nPolice also searched a storage unit at Caringbah where a boat was taken away for forensic testing.\n\nA third car, a silver Ford Falcon, was found at another location in Cronulla. It is this car detectives believe Mr Gao got into on Arab Road last Tuesday.\n\nSuperintendent Moore said the investigations would continue.\n\n\u201cOur inquiries to date have led us to conclude that Mr Gao has been murdered,\u201d Superintendent Moore said.\n\n\u201cWhile we have charged a man with murder, this investigation will continue and we may make further arrests.\n\nMr McNamara returns to court in July.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NSW", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "It is early Tuesday afternoon and a security camera catches some of the last movements of Sydney university student Jamie Gao as he walks from his sports car with a bag tightly held in his right hand.", "title": "Jamie Gao killed during drug deal with Glen McNamara and Roger Rogerson, police claim", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/jamie-gao-killed-during-drug-deal-with-glen-mcnamara-and-roger-rogerson-police-claim-20140526-38z5t.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/8/z/a/6/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.38z5t.png/1401916972530.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/8/z/a/6/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.38z5t.png/1401916972530.jpg"}, "description": "It is early Tuesday afternoon and a security camera catches some of the last movements of Sydney university student Jamie Gao as he walks from his sports car with a bag tightly held in his right hand.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jamie Gao killed during drug deal with Glen McNamara and Roger Rogerson, police claim"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "It is early Tuesday afternoon and a security camera catches some of the last movements of Sydney university student Jamie Gao as he walks from his sports car ..."}, "article_summary": "University student Jamie Gao was killed during a drug deal with former detectives Glen McNamara and Roger Rogerson, police will allege.\nPhoto: Janie BarrettPolice claim the two men in the car were Mr Rogerson, a disgraced former detective, and Mr McNamara.\nMr Rogerson, 73, was a decorated senior police officer until he shot and killed drug dealer Warren Lanfranchi in 1981.\nDetectives have flown to Queensland to speak to Mr Rogerson and have not ruled out further arrests.\nMr McNamara was charged on Monday with the murder of Mr Gao, whom police believe was killed over the three kilograms of ice he was carrying in that bag."}
