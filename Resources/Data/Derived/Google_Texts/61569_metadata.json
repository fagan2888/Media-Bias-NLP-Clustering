Peggy Greb, U.S. Department of Agriculture\n\nIn an effort to find the reasons for violent behavior among teens, many people point to video games, the media, or eroding families, yet one researcher believes the answer may be as simple as malnutrition.\n\n\u201cAbove all the most influential factor in the course of increasing violence has been changes in the American food system and loss of nutrients for children and growing teens,\u201d wrote Sylvia Onusic, Ph.D., in her article \u201cViolent Behavior: A Solution in Plain Sight.\u201d\n\nIn fact, deficiencies of vitamins and minerals may all contribute to anxiety, aggression, and violent behavior, according to Onusic, whose work was published earlier this year by The Weston A. Price Foundation, a nonprofit nutrition education foundation. Another factor that may be responsible for rising rates of violence? The increasing prevalence of psychiatric drug use among children and teens, says Onusic.\n\nFeed Your Head\n\nThe brain and nervous system require specific nutrients to function properly, Onusic explains in her article, yet a large number of Americans live on processed and other devitalized foods. Whether obese or thin, many people may actually be suffering from malnutrition, with deficiencies in key vitamins, such as A, D, K, B1, B3, B6, B12, and folate, as well as the minerals iodine, potassium, iron, magnesium, zinc, chromium, and manganese, all of which promote brain health.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, this means their brains are starving,\" wrote Onusic, who finds the evidence that nutrient deficiencies can lead to aggression and violent behavior to be \u201coverwhelming.\u201d\n\nOnusic first cites studies that show the vitamins A, D3 and K2 are all critical to brain development. For instance, researchers from the Children\u2019s Hospital and Research Center in Oakland, Calif., described how vitamin D, which is widely distributed throughout the brain, affects portions of the brain involved in learning and memory, as well as motor control. Other scientists have shown how vitamin K2 is needed for the formation of myelin, which insulates the nerves.\n\nMeanwhile, it is common knowledge that vitamin B maintains brain health. All our deficiencies in vitamins B1 or B3 may cause beriberi and pellagra, respectively, which include neurological symptoms such as confusion and even insanity. What many people don\u2019t understand is that they may have \u2018subclinical\u2019 symptoms resulting from slight yet still significant shortages of these vitamins. Also critical for positive mental health, B6 is a precursor for 50 enzymes and is necessary for the process of methylation. Vitamin B12 has been correlated with irrational anger and mental disorders, Onusic stated in her article. \u201cA higher incidence of low B12 is found in mental patients than in the general population,\u201d she wrote. Finally, folate has been associated with fetal growth retardation when mothers receive an inadequate supply during pregnancy.\n\nOn the mineral front, Onusic asserts that deficiencies in iodine, potassium, iron, magnesium, zinc, chromium, manganese, and other minerals (in some cases, prenatal scarcities) may result in mental symptoms, including hostility and aggression.\n\nThe Evil Vitamin S?\n\nCiting the work of Stephen J. Schoenthaler, Ph.D., a professor of criminal justice at California State University, Onusic describes how he has focused his research efforts on the effect of nutrition on cognition and behavior. In particular, he examines populations of school children, prisoners, and institutionalized juveniles. \u201cHe reported a significantly lower level of antisocial behavior after dietary modifications which involved decreasing sugar consumption during a three-month and nine-month period respectively,\u201d wrote Onusic.\n\nIn fact, hypoglycemia, caused by a diet high in sugar as well as refined carbohydrates, could explain many examples of antisocial behavior. With co-researchers Hippchen, Schauss, and others, he discovered that hypoglycemia causes the brain to secrete the neurotoxin glutamate, which may lead to agitation, depression, anger, anxiety, panic attacks, and violent behavior.\n\n\u201cMany factors in the environment are new to the genome since World War II,\u201d wrote Onusic. \u201cThese include changes and additions to the food we eat leading to severe nutrient deficiencies, changes in American agriculture and fertility of the soils, more chemicals in the environment...\u201d\n\nAmong these \u201cother\u201d changes, Onusic would include certain psychiatric medications.\n\nA Cure Worse Than The Illness\n\nIn his blog post, \"The secret at the bottom of psychiatry\u2019s rabbit hole,\u201d Pulitzer Prize nominee Jon Rappoport describes several acknowledged explanations for the school shootings, including access to guns and violence on TV, while also asking why the media has not named psychiatric drugs as a potential cause.\n\n\u201cIn an analysis of mass shootings during the past fifteen years, every shooter had been taking or withdrawing from a psychiatric drug,\u201d Onusic wrote, noting that, between 2004 and 2011, there were almost 13,000 reports to the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) MedWatch system of psychiatric drugs causing violent side effects. And an article published by PLOS One supports, in part, such claims.\n\nResearchers from the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, Harvard Medical School, and Wake Forest University School of Medicine identified 1,527 cases of violence reported for 31 drugs. Among the suspect drugs were varenicline (an aid to smoking cessation), various antidepressants, sedative/hypnotics, and three drugs for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\n\u201cActs of violence towards others are a genuine and serious adverse drug event associated with a relatively small group of drugs,\u201d the authors concluded. \u201cVarenicline, which increases the availability of dopamine, and antidepressants with serotonergic effects were the most strongly and consistently implicated drugs.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Onusic suggests education \u2014 \u201cclearly defining good nutrition and putting it back into the mouths of our children\u201d \u2014 as well as a grass roots effort to return balance to our food system. \u201cMeanwhile, none of us is safe,\u201d Onusic wrote. \u201cSociety as a whole must pay the price for the wholesale poison of our land, our air and our food supply.\u201d\n\nSources: Onusic S.
