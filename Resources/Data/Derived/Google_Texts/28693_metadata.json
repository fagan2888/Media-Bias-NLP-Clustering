The Longmont and Boulder YMCAs are two of roughly 2,700 Ys in 10,000 communities across the country. While YMCA is a national organization, every individual Y runs as a private corporation with an independent board of directors and CEO. YMCA bylaws require that every Y have a CEO. A YMCA chapter was organized in Boulder in 1874 as a social and spiritual center. Its first building, built in 1904 at 13th and Walnum closed in 1926 due to financial troubles. The Longmont YMCA began its programming in 1969, originally as an extension of the Boulder Valley YMCA. In 1989, the Longmont Y split and became an independent non-profit to better serve the needs of the Longmont community. Since 1989, the Ed & Ruth Lehman YMCA and the Boulder Valley YMCA \u2014 which has a location in Boulder and one in Lafayette\u2014 have existed as separate entities, with separate budgets and separate governance. The Longmont YMCA is named for Ed and Ruth Lehman, former owners of the Longmont Times-Call.\n\nAfter going through two CEOs in less than two years, Longmont's Ed & Ruth Lehman YMCA will soon be merged with the Boulder Valley YMCA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe timeline for the merger is unclear, but Boulder YMCA CEO Chris Coker is already managing the Longmont YMCA.\n\nCoker said he was approached by members of the Longmont YMCA Board of Directors in early 2014, after Longmont Y CEO Tony Shockency resigned after four years for reasons that are unclear.\n\n\"They had just gone through a transition with their CEO,\" Coker said. \"They asked, 'Can you take a look at our books and our programs and let us know what you think?\"\n\nBecause the bylaws by which all YMCAs are governed dictate that a Y should almost always have a CEO, the Longmont board of directors was searching for an interim person to fill the position. They settled on Noel Brendefur, who had previously worked in fundraising at the University of Colorado and at the Y in Boulder. Brendefur was hired in March 2014 but also resigned in June of this year due to reasons that are unclear.\n\n\"What happened then is the board said, 'This is crazy. We're going through so many transitions and we're not serving the community the way we want. Should we be re-marrying (the two facilities)?'\" Coker said.\n\nThe operating budget for the Longmont YMCA is $2 million, and the operating budget for the Boulder Valley YMCA is $10 million. The Boulder Valley facilities has almost three times the staff (460 as compared to 160) and 15,700 members, whereas the Longmont YMCA has 4,400 members. Coker said the merger could be advantageous for the Longmont YMCA.\n\n\"Our intent is to put these Y's all back together again,\" Coker said. \"All of them in Boulder County, because a $12 million Y umbrella can do a heck of a lot more than a $10 million one and a $2 million one ...With fitness staff there's a $5 to $8 pay differential right now (between Boulder Valley and Longmont). That's a massive rate increase that the (Longmont) staff will receive if this goes through.\"\n\nThe pool at the Ed & Ruth Lehman YMCA, 950 Lashley St., Wednesday afternoon. (Lewis Geyer / Staff Photographer)\n\nCoker said that two CEOs leaving in under two years does not signal financial instability for the Longmont Y.\n\n\"It wasn't about the finances, it was about what makes sense for resources,\" Coker said. \"There's a lot more stability with three YMCA's than with two. You can weather more.\"\n\nLongmont Y board member Meca Delgado said the decision to move forward with a merger was unanimous.\n\n\"This is still the exploratory phase, looking at the different options and making sure it's mutually beneficial for the communities and organization at large.\"\n\nRight now, Coker said he is unsure what a merger would mean for the two boards of directors, but Coker said that Longmont would still be well represented, as committees that exist under the board must contain members of the community the committee is serving.\n\n\"That's where we are right now, we haven't finished the conversations,\" Coker said, adding that he knows Longmont is a different community than Boulder or Lafayette and he wants to make sure the changes fit Longmont.\n\nLongmont resident, Longmont YMCA member and former board of directors member Stacy LaLonde said she is slightly worried about the merger.\n\n\"I would hope that the merger itself would not take away from serving the local community like the Longmont Y has been able to do to date,\" LaLonde said. \"My only concern is that dollars would be spent elsewhere as opposed to in the community that needs the actual services, like scholarships and preschool and early education and camps.\"\n\nGerald Golter, who is a long-time donor to the Longmont Y echoed those concerns.\n\n\"I feel like I have a connection there because I know Ed Lehman and I'd hate to see that change,\" Golter said. \"Keep it local.\"\n\nIsa Jones: 303-684-5274, jonesi@timescall.com or twitter.com/theisajones\n\nKaren Antonacci: 303-684-5226, antonaccik@times-call.com or twitter.com/ktonacci", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28682796/longmont-ymca-merge-boulder-valley-ymca", "modificationDate": "2015-08-24T08:39:12-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0821/20150821__23TCAYMCw~1_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Isa Jones And Karen Antonacci \n \n  Staff Writers", "description": "About the YMCAThe  YMCA is a national nonprofit organization which aims to promote youth development, healthy living and social responsibilities.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:28682796:view"}, "startDate": "2015-08-23T13:59:10-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28682796/longmont-ymca-merge-boulder-valley-ymca", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0821/20150821__23TCAYMCw~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "About the YMCAThe  YMCA is a national nonprofit organization which aims to promote youth development, healthy living and social responsibilities.", "title": "Longmont YMCA to merge with Boulder Valley YMCA"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "About the YMCAThe  YMCA is a national nonprofit organization which aims to promote youth development, healthy living and social responsibilities.", "title": "Longmont YMCA to merge with Boulder Valley YMCA", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_28682796/longmont-ymca-merge-boulder-valley-ymca", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0821/20150821__23TCAYMCw~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-08-23T13:59:10-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-08-21T18:18:41-0600", "sailthru.title": "Longmont YMCA to merge with Boulder Valley YMCA", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Isa Jones", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0821/20150821__23TCAYMCw~1.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-08-21T20:02:05-0600", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5d17\"", "article_summary": "The Longmont YMCA began its programming in 1969, originally as an extension of the Boulder Valley YMCA.\nThe operating budget for the Longmont YMCA is $2 million, and the operating budget for the Boulder Valley YMCA is $10 million.\nAdvertisementThe timeline for the merger is unclear, but Boulder YMCA CEO Chris Coker is already managing the Longmont YMCA.\nAfter going through two CEOs in less than two years, Longmont's Ed & Ruth Lehman YMCA will soon be merged with the Boulder Valley YMCA.\nSince 1989, the Ed & Ruth Lehman YMCA and the Boulder Valley YMCA \u2014 which has a location in Boulder and one in Lafayette\u2014 have existed as separate entities, with separate budgets and separate governance."}
