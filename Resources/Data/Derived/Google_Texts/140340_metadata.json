Photo courtesy of Shutterstock\n\nA collaborative study by French and English scientists observed that Viagra, the world\u2019s most famous \u201clittle blue pill,\u201d is able to stop the parasite which causes malaria from spreading from humans to mosquitoes. Experts believe this fascinating side effect of the erectile dysfunction medication could help control malaria cases and protect populations where the disease is prevalent.\n\nWhen a human is bitten by an infected mosquito, the bug will deposit the parasite Plasmodium falciparum into their blood stream. This parasite then takes residence in the individual's red blood cells. When an uninfected mosquito then bites a malaria patient, the bug will become infected with the parasite, facilitating the spread of disease.\n\nIn the study, the researchers noted that when an individual infected with malaria takes sildenafil (Viagra), the drug causes the parasite inside the red blood cells to \u201cstiffen.\u201d This causes the entire cell to become less flexible. As reported by The Mirror, the now stiff red blood cells are much more likely to become trapped by the body\u2019s blood filter, the spleen. Although the individual remains infected with malaria, the parasite-infected blood cells are removed from the body before they can be transmitted to another mosquito, further continuing the cycle.\n\nCurrent malaria treatments aim to stop immature forms of the parasite, but this approach is novel in that it targets the mature forms of the parasite.\n\n\"This strategy ... opens new avenues toward the design of novel interventions to halt the spread of malaria to humans,\" explained Ghania Ramdani, lead scientist in the study, as reported by The Mirror.\n\nBefore Viagra is given to malaria patients, the active drug will be modified to help prevent the drug\u2019s erectile effect.\n\nMalaria is a serious and sometimes fatal condition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that worldwide there are around 198 million cases of malaria each year and 500,000 deaths. The condition causes fever, chills, headache, sweats, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nThere is currently no cure or vaccine for malaria, but earlier this year GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s attempt at a vaccine proved to be \"partially effective.\" The vaccine prevented the disease in about 30 percent of the cases. The researchers involved with the vaccine\u2019s developments insist that although the drug is not completely effective, it may be able to help cure the huge burden of the disease.\n\n\u201cPreventing some of those attacks is not insignificant,\u201d said lead study author Dr. Brian Greenwood, as reported by Sky News.\n\nSource: Ramdani G, Naissant B, Thompson E, et al. cAMP-Signalling Regulates Gametocyte-Infected Erythrocyte Deformability Required for Malaria Parasite Transmission.
