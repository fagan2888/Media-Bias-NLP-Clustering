Gurley didn\u2019t specify which companies he thought might bite the dust.\n\nGurley made his remarks during a talk with Journalist and Book Author Malcolm Gladwell at South by Southwest Interactive Sunday. During the hour-long discussion, Gladwell quizzed Gurley on a variety of topics from healthcare to ridesharing to hacking. Near the end of the talk, an audience member, via Twitter, asked Gurley if he thought a tech bubble existed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that we are in a valuation bubble,\u201d Gurley said. \u201cWe are taking on, in these startups, especially these so-called unicorns, a level of risk that we haven\u2019t seen since 1999.\u201d\n\nBurn rates, the amount of cash companies are losing every month to operate, are higher than they have ever been, Gurley said. And in Silicon Valley, more people are working for unprofitable companies than ever in the history of the industry, he said.\n\nDespite that, there is no fear in Silicon Valley right now, Gurley said.\n\nThe problem is startups can\u2019t choose not to play, Gurley said. They are forced to play the game on the field, he said. If a competitor raises $900 million, then the startup must go and raise money, he said.\n\nGladwell asked him if he ever thought about just closing up shop.\n\n\u201cThe best way to protect yourself against the downside is to enjoy every last bit of the upside,\u201d Gurley said.\n\nA number of entrepreneurs today don\u2019t even remember the Dot Com bust of 2000, Gurley said. They were in 9th grade when that happened and the further they get away from that event, the more risk they are willing to take on, he said.\n\nGurley and his partners at Benchmark led early investments in GrubHub, Nextdoor, OpenTable, Snapchat, Twitter, Uber and Yelp.\n\nA big part of Gurley\u2019s talk with Gladwell focused on problems in the healthcare industry.\n\nGurley said he is a skeptic when it comes to solving the healthcare problem.\n\n\u201cThe real problem is there is an assumption of market forces when you do a startup,\u201d he said.\n\nBut those market forces are completely \u201cmucked up in healthcare,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernment incentives, in part, are to blame, Gurley said. In 2009, the federal government passed the reinvestment act and put in place a program where a doctor is paid $44,000 to implement Electronic Health Records, Gurley said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just shocking to me,\u201d he said.\n\nTo date, the payments total $29 billion for doctors to implement software they weren\u2019t actively implementing on their own, Gurley said. The doctors also get another $17,000 to make meaningful use of their Electronic Health Records.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the exact opposite of what entrepreneurs do,\u201d Gurley said.\n\nAs a result of the messed up economics, it\u2019s really tough for startups to compete in the healthcare industry, he said.\n\nThe U.S. spends 17 percent of Gross Domestic Product on healthcare, but Singapore spends just 1.7 percent of GDP on healthcare, Gurley said. That\u2019s because everyone in Singapore is a shopper looking for the best healthcare deal, he said. The Singapore government pays a portion of its citizens\u2019 healthcare costs on a sliding scale tied to income, he said.\n\nIn the U.S., the healthcare system is ballooning to largess, Gurley said. The costs of healthcare procedures vary widely. An MRI might cost $400 at an independent clinic and $3,200 at Stanford Medical Center, he said.\n\nObamacare depends, largely, on high deductible insurance plans and that could create shoppers out of everyone except for acute medical cases, Gurley said.\n\nThe biggest opportunity for having a massive impact on healthcare is in data aggregation and analysis, Gurley said.\n\nGladwell asked why does the hospital continue to exist? \u201cWhy are you delivering babies in the same place you are treating colon cancer?\u201d Gladwell asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s messed up,\u201d Gurley said.\n\nHigh deductible plans could simplify the whole system and bring back market forces, he said.\n\nGladwell asked Gurley, an investor and board member in the transportation alternative Uber, about the company\u2019s transformative effect on the transportation industry.\n\n\u201cIt is transformational in many, many ways,\u201d Gurley said.\n\nUber is one of the largest job creators in town. Globally, Uber has created 300,000 jobs so far, he said. For many people, the job allows them to have a flexible lifestyle, he said.\n\nUber is also having a dramatic impact on reducing DUI cases, Gurley said.\n\nHighway traffic fatalities result in 35,000 deaths a year with 10,000 of those related to driving under the influence, Gladwell said.\n\n\u201cIf something like Uber could cut that by a third, that would have a significant impact,\u201d Gladwell said.\n\nAustin, a city known to enjoy its libations, was slow to get in board with ride-sharing, Gurley said. But the impact ride sharing is having on the youth is considerable. They are not drinking and driving as much, he said.\n\nDevelopers in San Francisco are lobbying the city to remove rules requiring parking spots in San Francisco, Gurley said. People are not dependent on cars like they once were, he said. They don\u2019t need a car and they don\u2019t need a parking spot, he said.\n\nGurley joked that 30 percent of traffic is just people driving around looking for a parking spot.\n\nBut in San Francisco, the city with the highest employment growth rate in the country, traffic congestion is actually down, Gurley said.\n\nFor 80 years, the U.S. grossly underestimated the demand for public transportation and limited the supply for public transportation with city, state and federal governments.\n\nThe ridesharing industry is five times bigger in San Francisco than the entire black car and limo market and it\u2019s growing at 300 percent a year, he said.\n\n\u201cAt first it was an alternative to taxis,\u201d he said.\n\nBut now ridesharing is cheaper than taxis and it\u2019s touching the economics of the industry, he said. And it\u2019s affecting the rental car industry. People are renting fewer cars, he said.\n\nOverall, 97 percent of cars are idle, he said. The technology is allowing for greater efficiency in transportation alternatives, he said.\n\nGladwell pointed out that people of retirement age are now using Uber as an alternative to driving.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll see more in this area,\u201d Gurley said.\n\nAnd he pointed out that a lot of parents are putting their kids in Uber cars to take them to school activities and events.\n\nThe car is no longer a necessity, Gurley said. And, in fact, many young people don\u2019t even want one, he said.\n\n\u201cMillennials don\u2019t give a shit about cars,\u201d Gurley said.\n\nToday, many kids turn 16 and they won\u2019t get a driver\u2019s license, Gurley said.\n\nGurley also said he\u2019s \u201cmore of a skeptic on driverless cars than most people.\u201d The technology hasn\u2019t yet been perfected to allow for driverless cars, he said. A driverless car has to be way better than a human driver, as opposed to just as good, he said.\n\n\u201cI think we are way off from that,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "SiliconHills", "title": "Silicon Valley VC Bill Gurley Says Enjoy the Upside While it Lasts - SiliconHills", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.SILICONHILLSNEWS.COM/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CAKPP5cUgAEVZU8-300x225.jpg", "url": "http://www.siliconhillsnews.com/2015/03/16/silicon-valley-vc-bill-gurley-says-enjoy-the-upside-while-it-lasts/", "type": "article"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd041f\"", "article_summary": "The U.S. spends 17 percent of Gross Domestic Product on healthcare, but Singapore spends just 1.7 percent of GDP on healthcare, Gurley said.\nbyBy LAURA LOREKReporter with Silicon Hills NewsA few unicorns will die this year, said Bill Gurley, a prominent venture capitalist with Benchmark in Silicon Valley.\nAnd he pointed out that a lot of parents are putting their kids in Uber cars to take them to school activities and events.\n\u201cThe best way to protect yourself against the downside is to enjoy every last bit of the upside,\u201d Gurley said.\nGladwell asked Gurley, an investor and board member in the transportation alternative Uber, about the company\u2019s transformative effect on the transportation industry."}
