The Sunday Times of London first reported that the delay was 30 days. The former Pentagon official described a White House that was hesitant and continually asking for \"the intelligence to build up more.\"\n\nOther problems affecting the mission included a lack of informants on the ground, and a country the U.S. first approached about providing a base for the operation didn't want its territory used as the launch pad, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nMore On This...\n\nAlso, the U.S. had limited visibility in Syria, and a senior administration official told the paper that the only Pentagon requests for surveillance flights came just before the mission. The problem was exacerbated by the strong communication discipline of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, which made it harder to track hostages due to the subsequent lack of informants who could fill intelligence gaps.\n\nU.S. officials do not believe ISIS militants were tipped off, but also do not rule out the possibility.\n\nOne model for the operation was the 2011 raid into Pakistan that killed Usama bin Laden, though current and former U.S. defense and government officials told the Journal that this operation was in many ways a far bigger gamble.\n\nFox News' Catherine Herridge contributed to this report.\n\nClick here to read more from the Wall Street Journal.", "article_metadata": {"prism.subsection1": "defense", "classification": "/FOX NEWS/WORLD/WORLD REGIONS/Middle
