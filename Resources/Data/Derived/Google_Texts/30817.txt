â€” A prank call prompted a brief lockdown Thursday morning at Four Oaks middle and elementary schools in Johnston County, authorities said.

Four Oaks Police Chief Danny Toppings did not detail the threat but said the call and subsequent posts on social media were bogus. He said police know who initiated the prank and are looking for the person.

The lockdown began about 11:30 a.m. at the schools, which are about 2 miles apart. It was lifted about 25 minutes later.

Johnston County Schools spokeswoman Tracey Peedin Jones said the lockdown was initiated at the request of law enforcement, the schools were checked and everyone was safe.

"No one was in danger at any point or time," she said.

She said nothing was found and no one was taken into custody, but several officers remained at the schools to ease parents' worries.
