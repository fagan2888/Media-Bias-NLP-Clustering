A man accused of shooting five people at a Hattiesburg restaurant has yet to undergo a mental evaluation ordered in October.

The Hattiesburg American reports that there has not been any space at Mississippi State Hospital for Scott Ashley Tyner.

Tyner was arrested April 2, 2012, after four patrons and an employee were shot at Cucos Mexican CafÎ˜ on U.S. Highway 49. All have recovered.

Police have said he walked into the restaurant and opened fire without saying anything.

A Forrest County grand jury indicted him in August on five counts of aggravated assault carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years each.

Forrest County Circuit Court Judge Bob Helfrich ordered an evaluation of whether Tyner understands the proceedings and can help attorneys with his defense.
