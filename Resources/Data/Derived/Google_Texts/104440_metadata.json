The management team, who are all from Thunder Bay, hopes to mitigate this by hiring an additional 27 employees.\n\nTerry Smith, the technical implementation manager with Health E(fx), said when he first joined the company two years ago, they only had five staff members and three clients. That all changed a year later, when the staff numbers snowballed to 27 and more than 100 clients.\n\n\u201cWe are the fastest growing tech company in Thunder Bay that you\u2019ve never heard of,\u201d Smith joked. \u201cWe are not just an American company who has set up offices here in Canada, we are Canadians providing a needed service for the American workforce and we are here to stay.\u201d\n\nSmith said there is a tremendous growth potential with hundreds of employees in each of these companies.\n\nHe mentioned they are taking applications from Thunder Bay.\n\nNo formal education or training is necessary.\n\nSmith explained Obama care applies to companies with a hundred or more employees.\n\nHe said it is far more complicated than Canada\u2019s health care system. He mentioned that only those working full-time at 30 hours per week or 130 hours per month qualify and each employee is re-evaluated yearly.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case in Canada.\n\nThe company\u2019s job is to issue IRS tax returns to every employee from every company they represent. When the forms are filled out, the company reviews the data and averages out the amount of hours worked in order to determine if the employee qualifies.\n\nHeiko Voss, director of software innovation, said the founders of the company recognized an opportunity for the service after the law passed in 2010.\n\n\u201cIt was only this year that the law has come into full effect meaning, the employer has to report through IRS tax returns on all of their employees,\u201d he said.\n\nVoss added the company began with two of the current six partners, who worked together at Wardrobe Engineering, got the ball rolling. The two partners initiated Health E(fx) three years ago, with one heading to the U.S. to set up shop in Minneapolis. A duplicate version of Thunder Bay\u2019s Heath E(fx) exists in Minneapolis with another 27 American employees.\n\nFor more information about applying, email a resume to careers@healthefx.us.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Chronicle Journal", "description": "An American technology company with offices in Thunder Bay and Minneapolis, Minn. is hoping to add more to its roster.", "title": "Tech company looking to hire", "url": "http://www.chroniclejournal.com/news/local/tech-company-looking-to-hire/article_c1bc6aba-43b9-11e5-84c4-636cca32c3a3.html", "image": {"width": 576, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/chroniclejournal.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/90/3903a318-43ba-11e5-b198-1b89be7feb49/55cfeed38ebe8.image.jpg?resize=576%2C420", "height": 420}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CJ_ThunderBay", "card": "summary"}, "description": "An American technology company with offices in Thunder Bay and Minneapolis, Minn. is hoping to add more to its roster.", "keywords": "local,featured", "news_keywords": "local,featured"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e80\"", "article_summary": "The two partners initiated Health E(fx) three years ago, with one heading to the U.S. to set up shop in Minneapolis.\nHe said it is far more complicated than Canada\u2019s health care system.\nA duplicate version of Thunder Bay\u2019s Heath E(fx) exists in Minneapolis with another 27 American employees.\nAn American technology company with offices in Thunder Bay and Minneapolis, Minn. is hoping to add more to its roster.\nTerry Smith, the technical implementation manager with Health E(fx), said when he first joined the company two years ago, they only had five staff members and three clients."}
