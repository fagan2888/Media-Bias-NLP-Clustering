Martin Truex Jr. bolted to the front of the pack after the final turn Sunday in the season-opening Daytona 500 \u2014 he took the lead 10 feet from the finish line. But the 0.034 of a second remaining to cover those 10 feet, at full speed, took an eternity.\n\nDenny Hamlin inched past Truex door to door at the checkered flag. In a photo finish \u2014 the closest ending in the 58-year history of the Daytona 500 \u2014 Hamlin edged Truex by about 4 inches to win the \u201cSuper Bowl of stock car racing.\u201d\n\nHamlin\u2019s extraordinary margin of victory over Truex: 0.010 of a second.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where that came from,\u201d Hamlin said from the track after winning the Daytona 500 for the first time. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. I can\u2019t even figure out what I did.\u201d\n\nHamlin led a race-high 34 laps. Truex, driving for Denver-based Furniture Row Racing, led once. But for a flash, it seemed to be the perfect time.\n\nTruex started the final lap running second, drafting behind Matt Kenseth in the lead. The top four broke away from the pack. And when Hamlin made a move to the outside from the fourth spot, Kenseth rose to block him. That gave Truex a line to the inside. He took the lead. Kenseth nearly spun out of control as Hamlin went by. But Hamlin got a bump forward from a teammate, Kevin Harvick.\n\nThen through the final turn, Hamlin and Truex bumped twice, fighting for position.\n\n\u201cHe just side-drafted me,\u201d said Truex, who posted his first top-five finish in the Daytona 500. \u201cI probably should have rode him up a little more. He got me by a couple feet.\u201d\n\nThe previous closest finish in Daytona 500 history was Kevin Harvick\u2019s 0.020 margin of victory over Mark Martin in 2007 \u2014 twice as long as Hamlin\u2019s victory over Truex.\n\nSunday, the finish was jammed. Kyle Busch, the defending Sprint Cup champion, placed third. Harvick finished fourth \u2014 just 0.15 of a second behind.\n\nKenseth, who led to start the final lap, fell to 14th. It was that crowded.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t get much more crushing than that,\u201d Kenseth said.\n\nTruex\u2019s runner-up effort was startling. After crashing on the final lap in qualifying Thursday at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Fla., he was forced to a back-of-the-pack starting position at 28th. And his ride was wrecked \u2014 Truex used FRR\u2019s backup car for the Denver-based 78.\n\nTruex dropped to 31st at the start Sunday. But even in a substitute car, he found some of the fastest speeds in the field.\n\n\u201cIt hurts a little bit,\u201d Truex said. \u201cWe were in the right spot. We made the right moves. You can second-guess all day long; the only thing I could have done different was be more aggressive to the line.\u201d\n\nFRR, which switched its manufacturer from Chevrolet to Toyota and changed its technical alliance from Richard Childress Racing to Joe Gibbs Racing, entered the season opener with a trunk full of question marks.\n\nTruex finished last year in fourth place in the season standings \u2014 a shocking rise for FRR, the only Sprint Cup team based outside North Carolina. Truex\u2019s rise started with seven consecutive top-10 finishes in 2015.\n\nThree of the top-five finishers Sunday at Daytona race for Joe Gibbs, and Truex acts as a kind of extra teammate. A second-place finish Sunday in NASCAR\u2019s season-opening race, the biggest race of the year, seems to bode well for Truex and Denver\u2019s 78. Even if he came up a split second short of a huge win.\n\n\u201cI felt like I had enough momentum to keep him behind me,\u201d Truex said of Hamlin. \u201cAnd I did until those last couple feet. He just shot out front in those last couple inches.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or @nickgroke\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nRace to a photo finish\n\nMartin Truex Jr., in the Denver-based Furniture Row Racing 78 car, finished mere inches behind winner Denny Hamlin at Sunday\u2019s NASCAR season-opening Daytona 500.

What happened on the final lap:\n\n\u2022 Truex started the final lap in second place, drafting right on Matt Kenseth\u2019s bumper.\n\n\u2022 Denny Hamlin, from the fourth spot, made a move to the outside, trying to reach the front. Kenseth drifted high to block him.\n\n\u2022 Truex zipped on the inside line into the lead. Kenseth nearly spun out of control as Hamlin went by. But Hamlin got a bump forward from Kevin Harvick.\n\n\u2022 After the final turn, Truex and Hamlin bumped each other twice side-by-side in a drag race. Hamlin won by 0.010 seconds.\n\nThe Top Five (start position in parentheses)\n\n1. (11) Denny Hamlin, Toyota, 95 laps led\n\n2. (28) Martin Truex Jr., Toyota, 2 lap led\n\n3.
