Pierre, SD

A famous South Dakota effigy returns home this fall, and the South Dakota State Historical Society wants it to receive a warm welcome back.

South Dakota's Great Sioux Horse Effigy has been traveling as a part of the international touring exhibition, "The Plains Indians: Artists of Earth and Sky" since April of last year. The iconic effigy was on display at famous museums in Paris, Kansas City, and New York City. Over half a million people viewed the horse statue during its travels.

The piece will be returning in October this year to be placed in a special new display along with two other effigies carved by Hunkpapa Lakota Leader No Two Horns, who is also thought to be the artist behind the Great Sioux Horse Effigy.

To honor its arrival, the SD State Historical Society will be hosting a Return Celebration October 10-12 at the Cultural Heritage Center in Pierre. The 3-day event will feature craft activities, a blessing ceremony, and a special dinner that will include special guest speakers.

More information about the event is expected to be released by late July or early August.
