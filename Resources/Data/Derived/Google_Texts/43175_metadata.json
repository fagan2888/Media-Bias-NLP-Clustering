He said when he called the child\u2019s name and didn\u2019t get an answer, he noticed the door was ajar and immediately rushed to search for him on his bicycle, ABC reported.\n\nThe family\u2019s home is about two blocks from the highway and the boy cut through neighbors yards to take his truck out on the road, Citrus County Sheriff\u2019s Office spokeswoman Lindsay Blair told ABC.\n\nThe child was not struck by traffic on the highway, witnesses told police. One witness used a blanket to cover the boy, who was only wearing a shirt and a diaper as temperatures dipped to about 52 degrees.\n\nPolice said both father and son made it home safely. The Department of Children and Families is now investigating the case. The names of the father and child are being withheld pending the investigation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A three-year-old boy came dangerously close to having a tragic accident when he was found driving a motorized toy truck on a busy Florida highway, police said.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A three-year-old boy came dangerously close to having a tragic accident when he was found driving a motorized toy truck on a busy Florida highway, police said.", "title": "Toddler takes motorized toy big rig out on busy Fla. highway", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/9/toddler-found-driving-toy-big-rig-florida-highway/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/09/Big_Rig.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/09/Big_Rig.jpg", "description": "A three-year-old boy came dangerously close to having a tragic accident when he was found driving a motorized toy truck on a busy Florida highway, police said.", "card": "summary", "title": "Toddler takes motorized toy big rig out on busy Fla. highway"}, "Author": "Kellan Howell", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime"}, "article_summary": "A three-year-old boy came dangerously close to having a tragic accident when he was found driving a motorized toy truck on a busy Florida highway, police said.\nThe boy ended up on the highway after he escaped from his house while his father was using the bathroom.\nThe child was not struck by traffic on the highway, witnesses told police.\nBy the time police arrived on the scene, several drivers had formed a blockade around the child, who was sitting behind the wheel of his toy big rig in the median of the highway.\nThe names of the father and child are being withheld pending the investigation."}
