(Achadjian, who owns several gas stations in the area, has pointed to his busy assembly schedule as the reason he lags in campaign fundraising.)\n\nStill, his home-court advantage was clear. When asked if he wanted to rebut Ostrander\u2019s assertion that health care should be a right \u2014 \u201cnot a privilege\u201d \u2014 he said, \u201cNo, I want to give him my applause for pronouncing my name correctly.\u201d The audience laughed.\n\nThe crowd booed, however, after Republican Kokkonen said the United States has the best and most sophisticated medical care in the world.
