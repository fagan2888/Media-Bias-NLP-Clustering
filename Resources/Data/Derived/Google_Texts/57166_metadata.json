Nearly 60 percent of the more than 11 million Obamacare exchange customers receive cost-sharing reductions through \"silver\" health plans. The customers qualify because they earn between 100 percent and 250 percent of the federal poverty level, or $11,670 to $46,680 for an individual.\n\nThe reductions are available only to customers of silver plans, which are the second-least expensive category of plans, and which cover an average of 70 percent of the overall cost of members' health benefits.\n\nIn its suit, the House noted that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the payments to insurers would total about $178 billion from 2014 through 2024.\n\n\"Such unconstitutional payments are estimated to exceed $3 billion in fiscal year 2014,\" the House suit says.\n\nIn the absence of Congressional appropriation for that money, the administration has been funding those payments out of the account that subsidizes monthly premiums for most Obamacare customers. Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell told Congress last year that was being done on the grounds of \"efficiency,\" the suit noted.\n\nTimothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor and leading Obamacare expert, said that without the cost-sharing reductions from the government, \"Insurers would have to significantly raise premiums and might face solvency issues until they could do so.\"\n\n\n\nWhile many insurers would raise premiums, both inside and outside the Obamacare exchanges, to cover their added costs, some issuers \"could leave the market\" to avoid dealing with the costs, he said.\n\n\n\nCost-sharing reductions are \"a huge thing\" for their recipients, and not having them would be a \"deal breaker,\" Jost said.\n\n\n\nRead MoreJoy and disappointment after Obamacare ruling\n\n\n\nHe noted that cost-sharing reductions can turn a silver plan's $5,000 annual deductible into just a $200 deductible.\n\n\"Even if you're paying $50 per month for your silver plan [in premiums] if you've got a $5,000 deductible, forget it, you're as good as uninsured,\" Jost said. Without the cost-sharing reductions, \"People are simply not going to be able to afford coverage.\"", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "The case revolves around subsidies that help reduce out-of-pocket costs for most Obamacare customers.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "The case revolves around subsidies that help reduce out-of-pocket costs for most Obamacare customers.", "title": "Not so fast\u2014The next threat to Obamacare", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/26/obamacare-faces-threat-from-another-case.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/06/26/102791973-aca-supreme-court.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The case revolves around subsidies that help reduce out-of-pocket costs for most Obamacare customers.", "title": "Not so fast\u2014the next threat to Obamacare", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/26/obamacare-faces-threat-from-another-case.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/06/26/102791973-aca-supreme-court.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, Obamacare, US: News, Politics, Health Insurance, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-06-26T17:23:00-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2015-06-26T17:23:01-0400", "tag": "Health Insurance"}, "pageNodeId": 102791870, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Supreme Court, King v.
