Two policemen and a journalist were also injured.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear who was behind the attack and there were conflicting reports about what led to it.\n\nInterior Minister Efkan Ala and other officials said the assault was against police officers, and that Elci died in an ensuing clash. However, the Diyarbakir Bar Association said the lawyer, who was Kurdish, was the target of the attack.\n\nElci, 49, was the head of the bar association in the mainly Kurdish city and a human rights activist.\n\nHe was briefly detained and questioned last month for saying during a live news program that the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, is not a terrorist organization. Soon after, he was charged with making terrorist propaganda and was facing more than seven years in prison.\n\nTurkey and its allies consider the PKK to be a terrorist organization, and the government has stepped up attacks against it in recent months. The PKK has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.\n\nAla said the attack began with two people firing at police from an area some 100 meters (109 yards) away from where Elci was speaking. A policeman died in that attack. Ala said Elci died soon after in a clash between the police and assailants.\n\nPrime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu spoke of two possible scenarios.\n\n\u201cOne possibility is that after this terror attack, the assailants assassinated Mr. Elci,\u201d Davutoglu said. \u201cA second possibility is that \u2026 Elci got caught in the crossfire.\u201d\n\nDavutoglu vowed to find the culprits through a \u201ctransparent\u201d investigation and promised no cover-up.\n\nA government official said four inspectors have been assigned to investigate the case, adding that the government was \u201cdetermined to shed light\u201d on the attack.\n\nHe said authorities believe that Elci was caught in the crossfire, but were not ruling out \u201cthe possibility that a third party directly targeted him.\u201d The official cannot be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.\n\nElci had said through his Twitter account that he had received death threats because of his televised comments in which he defended the rebels.\n\nAuthorities declared a curfew in the Sur neighborhood where the attack occurred \u2014 a scene of frequent clashes between security forces and Kurdish youths.\n\nProtests later broke out in Diyarbakir and elsewhere denouncing the killing.\n\nIn Diyarbakir, police used pressurized water against a group of protesters who hurled rocks and fire crackers. Police also dispersed hundreds of people who had gathered in central Istanbul chanting: \u201cWe are all Tahir, we are all Elci.\u201d\n\nAt the time of the attack, Elci and other lawyers were making a statement about the destruction caused to a historic mosque by the clashes in Sur. Elci had strongly advocated an end to the renewed violence between the PKK and security forces.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy expressed shock over Elci\u2019s death, calling him a \u201ccourageous defender of human rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur condolences go to his family, that of the policeman killed and to all of Turkey. A terrible loss,\u201d the embassy said on Twitter.\n\nElci was the lawyer for Mohammed Rasool, a journalist who has worked for The Associated Press and other media organizations.
