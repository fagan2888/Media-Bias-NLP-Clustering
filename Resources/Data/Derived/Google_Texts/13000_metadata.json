Two people were arrested in a midtown Tulsa apartment just before 10 p.m. November 21, 2013.\n\n\n\nPolice say they were called to the 1200 block of South Quaker Avenue, and several witnesses pointed out the apartment from which they'd heard the gunshots. Officers looked into a window and saw someone moving around inside with a flashlight.\n\nOfficers talked to Kenneth L. Etter, 24, who said he lived in the apartment. Etter said no one else was at home, but officers say they caught Magen Marie Ansart trying to leave through the back door.\n\nAnsart, 22, was carrying three bottles of crystal methamphetamine, one bag of marijuana, a bottle of Adderall (amphetamine) and smoking paraphernalia, according to an arrest report.\n\n\"Due to the shots heard and the dishonesty of Etter, a protective sweep was done inside the residence to ensure no one was injured,\" the arresting officer said in his report. When they found guns in plain sight, officers got a search warrant for the apartment.\n\nThey then found several firearms including two AK-47s, a .223 rifle, a shotgun, several handguns, ammunition and a Kevlar vest. Scales, baggies and a large sum of cash were also discovered.\n\nIn an arrest report, Ansart said Etter told her to \"grab the dope and get out of the back of the house\" when police arrived Thursday night.\n\nKenneth Etter was booked on complaints of possession of a firearm in commission of a felony, possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, possession of meth and committing a felony with body armor. He had some outstanding traffic offenses as well. He was booked on a $33,768 bond.\n\nMagen Ansart was booked on complaints of possession of a firearm in commission of a felony, possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, possession of meth and committing a felony with body armor. She was booked on a $33,000 bond.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-14", "Description": "Tulsa police responded to a shots fired called and found numerous weapons, drugs and cash in a mid-town apartment.", "author": "Dee Duren", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/24043966/tulsa-couple-arrested-with-cache-of-weapons-drugs", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24043966_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Tulsa police responded to a shots fired called and found numerous weapons, drugs and cash in a mid-town apartment.", "title": "Tulsa Couple Arrested With Stash Of Weapons, Drugs"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24043966_SA.jpg", "description": "Tulsa police responded to a shots fired called and found numerous weapons, drugs and cash in a mid-town apartment.", "card": "summary", "title": "Tulsa Couple Arrested With Stash Of Weapons, Drugs"}, "wnreadableurl": "tulsa-couple-arrested-with-cache-of-weapons-drugs", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2013/11/22", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS28", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e76\"", "article_summary": "Etter said no one else was at home, but officers say they caught Magen Marie Ansart trying to leave through the back door.\nMagen Ansart was booked on complaints of possession of a firearm in commission of a felony, possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, possession of meth and committing a felony with body armor.\nTwo people were arrested in a midtown Tulsa apartment just before 10 p.m. November 21, 2013.\nKenneth Etter was booked on complaints of possession of a firearm in commission of a felony, possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, possession of meth and committing a felony with body armor.\nTulsa police say a \"shots fired\" call led them to a drug bust late Thursday night."}
