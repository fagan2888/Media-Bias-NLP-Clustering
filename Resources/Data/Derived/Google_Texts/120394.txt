Police say a fight broke out, vehicles were damaged and shots fired into the air when a party got out of hand early Sunday morning.

Police received multiple calls about the disturbance in the front yard of a home on the 1100 block of Tulip drive in Colorado Springs.

Police say whoever fired the shots fired them into the air, not at someone. When officers got there, the party was breaking up and people were leaving in multiple vehicles.

There is no suspect information and no arrests have been made.
