Four Northwest Florida school districts serving military-related students will receive millions more in state aid next year. It is due to a budget initiative by Senator Don Gaetz and Representative Matt Gaetz.

What’s called the “military-connected student supplement” is part of a multi-year initiative by Senator Gaetz and Representative Gaetz to make Florida and Florida schools the most military-friendly in the nation.

The funds are designed to help schools pay for additional services, counseling and academic help for students whose parents are deployed or who are affected by military moves. Don Gaetz, a former Okaloosa schools superintendent, said he knows firsthand about the need for educators to provide extra assistance and support to military families, especially when mom or dad are thousands of miles away.

“Northwest Florida is privileged to host bases and missions that bring us children from all over America and the world,” Senator Gaetz said. “Military families sometimes arrive new to Florida just a few days before school starts. They may need screening to determine the class or course or grade that’s the best fit. They may need academic coaching. A parent may get orders out of the country the week before Christmas and the school needs to step up and provide counseling.”

Under the new state funding formula devised by Senator Gaetz and Representative Gaetz, Santa Rosa County schools will receive an extra $1,179,653 per year as a “federally connected student supplement.” Escambia County schools are slated for $1,779,277 in supplemental funding. Bay County is entitled to $794,603 and Okaloosa, with the largest concentration of military students, will benefit from $2,405,227 in extra state support.
