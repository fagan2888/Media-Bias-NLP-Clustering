It\u2019s horrible,\u201d Janssen told Reuters Health.\n\nThat feeling \u2014 known as gender dysphoria \u2014 may increase the risks of suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, depression and anxiety for some transgender and gender-nonconforming children, said Janssen, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new paper.\n\nWriting in Pediatrics, Dr. Elyse Pine and colleagues report on 36 patients, ages 7-17, who were treated at two health clinics between 2010 and 2015. On average, the youths were at an early stage of puberty known as Tanner stage 3, when the penis or breasts begin to enlarge.\n\nThe irreversible changes that come with puberty can be detrimental to the psychological and general well-being of people whose bodies don\u2019t match their gender identities, Pine and colleagues wrote.\n\n\u201cPuberty blockers allow those changes to be put on hold and gives kids and families time to think through the consequences, benefits and alternatives of their choices and options,\u201d Janssen told Reuters.\n\nIn their essay, Pine and colleagues say 89 percent of their patients eventually received puberty blockers and insurance ultimately covered the cost in 72 percent of cases. In some cases, insurance carriers approved puberty blockers right away, some cases were approved after an appeal and another patient coverage after a state discrimination appeal, the Reuters article said.\n\nTwo of the most popular puberty-blocking treatments involve either injections or a small device implanted under the skin. Depending on the patient\u2019s age and the brand of treatment, the costs can range from approximately $3,500 to more than $20,000, Pine\u2019s team reports.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and several states now say a gender non-discrimination clause in the 2010 Affordable Care Act covers transgender and gender-nonconforming people. Health care providers, the authors say, should know that appealing insurance denials can succeed, the Reuters article notes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pine and colleagues say 89 percent of their patients eventually received puberty blockers and insurance ultimately covered the cost in 72 percent of cases.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights", "description": "Pine and colleagues say 89 percent of their patients eventually received puberty blockers and insurance ultimately covered the cost in 72 percent of cases.", "title": "Puberty blockers for trans youth explored", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 460, "identifier": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2015/11/Leuprorelin_460x470_public_domain.jpg", "height": 470}, "url": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/11/06/puberty-blockers-for-trans-youth-explored/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pine and colleagues say 89 percent of their patients eventually received puberty blockers and insurance ultimately covered the cost in 72 percent of cases.", "creator": "@WashBlade", "image": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2015/11/Leuprorelin_460x470_public_domain.jpg", "title": "Puberty blockers for trans youth explored", "site": "@WashBlade", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 13357499221}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WashingtonBlade", "section": "Health", "tag": "U.S. Department of Health and Human Services", "published_time": "2015-11-06T14:36:01-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Aron Janssen, Elyse Pine, NYU Langone Medical Center's Gender and Sexuality Service, Pediatrics, puberty blockers, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services"}, "article_summary": "In their essay, Pine and colleagues say 89 percent of their patients eventually received puberty blockers and insurance ultimately covered the cost in 72 percent of cases.\nIn some cases, insurance carriers approved puberty blockers right away, some cases were approved after an appeal and another patient coverage after a state discrimination appeal, the Reuters article said.\nHealth care providers, the authors say, should know that appealing insurance denials can succeed, the Reuters article notes.\nOn average, the youths were at an early stage of puberty known as Tanner stage 3, when the penis or breasts begin to enlarge.\nThe irreversible changes that come with puberty can be detrimental to the psychological and general well-being of people whose bodies don\u2019t match their gender identities, Pine and colleagues wrote."}
