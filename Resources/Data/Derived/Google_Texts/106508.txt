Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump suggested a tariff on Mexico could help pay for the wall he wants to build on the United States’ southern border.

“We’re not paying for it,” the real estate mogul said in an interview that aired Tuesday evening on Fox News’ “Hannity” program. “You know how easy that is? They’ll probably just give us the money.”

“I watch politicians come on: ‘can you imagine, Sean, he’s saying Mexico’s going to pay? They’ll never pay.’ And I’m saying, that’s like a hundred percent,” he said. “That’s not like 98 percent. Sean, it’s a hundred percent they’re [going to] pay. And if they don’t pay, we’ll charge ‘em a little tariff. It’ll be paid. But we need the wall.”

“We have to stop these killers from coming in,” he said. “When you look at all of the murders that are happening and all of the crime that’s happening, and I’ve been saying, and I’ve said it: Mexico is sending - they’re very smart - Mexico is sending some rough people, some bad dudes, and you see some of those dudes.”
