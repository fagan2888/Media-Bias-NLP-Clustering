They begin a three-game series against the Chicago Cubs on Monday in their first road trip of the year.\n\nBrandon Phillips led off the ninth with a single. After a popout, Bruce tripled down the right-field line against Arquimedes Caminero (0-1).\n\n\u201cI knew Caminero was throwing really, really hard, but he didn\u2019t throw me a lot of fastballs,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cI told myself to think small and it turned out big. I think he broke my bat with a cutter-slider thing.\u201d\n\nFormer Pirates right-hander Ross Ohlendorf (2-0) escaped a first-and-second, one-out jam in the ninth to get the win.\n\nEugenio Suarez opened the Reds sixth with his fourth home run, tying at 1. He finished with three hits.\n\nSuarez is the first Reds player with four homers in the first six games since Adam Dunn had four in six in 2004, the Reds said in citing the Elias Sports Bureau.\n\nTim Melville, a non-roster player in spring training, made his major league debut for the Reds and admitted to being nervous. The 26-year-old right-hander needed 37 pitches to negotiate a 20-minute, scoreless top of the first that ended with the bases loaded.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those moments. It\u2019s not a dream anymore,\u201d Melville said. \u201cI was nervous. It happens to the best of us. I told myself to get back to the game plan and get strike one. You\u2019re out there by yourself.\n\nMelville threw 92 pitches, 55 for strikes, while lasting four innings. Pittsburgh stranded eight runners against him, six in scoring position.\n\nPirates left-hander Jeff Locke allowed one run in six innings in his season debut.\n\nChris Stewart, batting for the first time this season, homered in the Pirates second.\n\nReds left fielder Adam Duvall saved a run in the eighth, throwing out Josh Harrison trying to score from second on John Jaso\u2019s single. Pirates manager Clint Hurdle challenged the call, which was upheld, but Harrison still wondered if catcher Devin Mesoraco didn\u2019t illegally block the plate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a gray area,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is. At the end of the day, that\u2019s what they called. \u2026 It\u2019s instinctive. You have to trust your gut. I feel like I did as much as I could to try to get around it.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the game\u2019s over. We had our chances.\u201d\n\nThat was Pittsburgh\u2019s only hit in 14 at-bats with runners in scoring position.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we were pressing,\u201d Hurdle said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go back and look at the tape to make sure guys weren\u2019t rolling over, trying to do too much.\u201d\n\nBEEN A WHILE\n\nThe last time the Reds were 5-1 was 2011. They went on to finish 79-83.\n\nSHORT STAY\n\nTo make room on the roster for Melville, the Reds cut first baseman Brandon Allen, who had just been promoted from Triple-A Louisville on Friday. Allen, who didn\u2019t play in the two games he was with the Reds, cleared waivers and was outrighted to Louisville.\n\nLAST MAN\n\nRight-hander Dan Straily became the last player on Cincinnati\u2019s opening-day roster to make an appearance when he took over for Melville in the fifth. He pitched three hitless innings.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nPirates: Stewart played for the first time this season while C Francisco Cervelli got his first day off.\n\nReds: Manager Bryan Price still hopes RHP Anthony DeSclafani can start on Friday in St. Louis. But Price said Sunday that the longer DeSclafani is sidelined with his left oblique strain, the more likely it is that he will need a rehab assignment.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPirates: Former Mets LHP Jon Niese makes his second start of the season and first of his career at Detroit\u2019s Comerica Park on Monday. Niese last pitched against Detroit in 2010 with the Mets.\n\nReds: LHP Brandon Finnegan makes his first career appearance against the Cubs. Finnegan got a no-decision against the Phillies on Wednesday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jay Bruce came up big by thinking small.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Jay Bruce came up big by thinking small.", "title": "Bruce hits winning triple in 9th, Reds edge Pirates", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/10/bruce-hits-winning-triple-in-9th-reds-edge-pirates/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/08/pirates_reds_baseball.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/08/pirates_reds_baseball.jpeg", "description": "Jay Bruce came up big by thinking small.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bruce hits winning triple in 9th, Reds edge Pirates"}, "Author": "MARK SCHMETZER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Suarez is the first Reds player with four homers in the first six games since Adam Dunn had four in six in 2004, the Reds said in citing the Elias Sports Bureau.\nThe Reds swept the Philadelphia Phillies and then took two of three from the Pirates for a 5-1 start.\nBruce hit an RBI triple in the ninth inning, and the Cincinnati Reds capped a strong season-opening homestand with a 2-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Sunday.\nTim Melville, a non-roster player in spring training, made his major league debut for the Reds and admitted to being nervous.\n\u201cI knew Caminero was throwing really, really hard, but he didn\u2019t throw me a lot of fastballs,\u201d Bruce said."}
