She was \u201cNo. 1\u201d \u2014 the number hanging around her neck \u2014 to those who didn\u2019t know her.\n\nMore than once, she started spelling a word before the announcer got to the definition. She spoke clearly, calmly \u2014 then zipped back to her chair and began incessantly tapping her foot on the stage floor.\n\nAfter she spelled one final word right, 12-year-old Sylvie Lamontagne was crowned champion of the 75th annual Colorado State Spelling Bee, topping a field of 250 other fourth- through eighth-graders.\n\nThe clinching word was sympatric \u2014 which means occupying the same range or area.\n\nClutching her trophy at the University of Denver\u2019s Sturm Hall, Sylvie said she prepared by studying word lists, patterns and roots.\n\n\u201cI just kept telling myself I had a decent chance,\u201d said the seventh-grader from Creighton Middle School in Lakewood.\n\nSylvie drew some of the toughest words of the final rounds: nasturtium (a family of pungent herbs), eczematous (related to inflamed skin) and intussusception (an intestinal problem).\n\nOnly one word rattled Sylvie: guttiferous.

Can you use it in a sentence?\u201d\n\n\u201cThough Brett denied that he was a hipster, his wooden-framed glasses and vinyl record collection said differently.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t help any.\n\nAs Colorado champ, Sylvie will compete for a chance to win $30,000 in the 2015 Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C., in May.\n\nEric Gorski: 303-954-1971 or egorski@denverpost.com\n\nSpelling test\n\nA sampling of late-round words:\n\n\n\nSympatric\n\nVinyl\n\nIsotope\n\nSinecure\n\nHomophony\n\nPeristaltic\n\nUmbrageous\n\nNautical\n\nFuliginous\n\nGuttiferous", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "\u201cSympatric\u201d is music to Colorado State Spelling Bee champion", "title": "\u201cSympatric\u201d is music to Colorado State Spelling Bee champion", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/14/sympatric-is-music-to-colorado-state-spelling-bee-champion/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150314__CD15SPELLING_KO12970p1.jpg", "height": 504}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150314__CD15SPELLING_KO12970p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-14T19:46:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T21:03:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce82b\"", "article_summary": "RELATED: How \u201cvinyl\u201d broke one Colorado State Spelling Bee contestantSecond place went to Edwin Wojcik, a sixth-grader at DSST Conservatory Green Middle School in Denver.\nAfter she spelled one final word right, 12-year-old Sylvie Lamontagne was crowned champion of the 75th annual Colorado State Spelling Bee, topping a field of 250 other fourth- through eighth-graders.\nAs Colorado champ, Sylvie will compete for a chance to win $30,000 in the 2015 Scripps National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C., in May.\nA boy in a rainbow-colored hoodie fought for several minutes with the word vinyl.\nMore than once, she started spelling a word before the announcer got to the definition."}
