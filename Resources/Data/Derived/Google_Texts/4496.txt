Manchester officials worry state budget cuts will affect heroin fight



MANCHESTER — City officials are raising concerns about proposed cuts in the state budget that could impact efforts to combat drug abuse in the city.



The board of mayor and aldermen voted on Tuesday to send a letter urging the House Finance Committee, which is currently hammering out its proposed 2016-2017 biennial budget, to maintain if not bolster funding for substance abuse programs.

..

Among the changes that have received preliminary approval from the committee are level funding the Governor’s Commission on Alcohol and Substance Abuse at about $3.6 million, rather than tripling funding as Gov. Maggie Hassan called for in her proposed budget.

..

The committee also backed eliminating funding for a substance abuse benefit in the standard Medicaid program.



The proposals are part of a larger effort by the Republican-controlled committee to trim $180 million from the two-year budget of the Health and Human Services Department. The committee is also considering letting the state’s Medicaid expansion under Obamacare, known as the NH Health Protection Program, expire at the end of 2016.

At the aldermen’s meeting on Tuesday, Mayor Ted Gatsas said elected leaders at all levels needed to know the seriousness of the drug problem facing the city.



“With the heroin epidemic, there’s no question I tell it to every presidential candidate that comes in. It’s going to be the demise of this country,” he said. “It’s really, really hurting families in this community and throughout the state of New Hampshire. Something has to happen.”

..

Gatsas, a Republican and former state senator, said on Wednesday that he may reach out to the chairman of the House Finance Committee, Rep. Neal Kurk, R-Weare. “I’ve had a good working relationship with him,” he said.

..

The proposal to limit funding for substance abuse programs comes as the Manchester Police Department issued a public warning earlier this week in response to a dramatic increase in overdoses and deaths in the city in the first months of 2015. There were 105 overdoses in the city, most heroin-related, and more than a dozen deaths, according to statistics released by the police.

..

Ward 1 Alderman Joyce Craig, who raised the issue on Tuesday, said in a memo to the board that New Hampshire was second in the nation for per-capita substance abuse, but ranked 49th in per-capita spending on prevention and treatment.

..

‘“We are facing a substance abuse epidemic in our city, and these funds are necessary to provide the services required to combat it,” Joyce wrote.



Manchester joins advocates for the needy and social service providers who have strongly criticized the cuts proposed by the House Finance Committee.
