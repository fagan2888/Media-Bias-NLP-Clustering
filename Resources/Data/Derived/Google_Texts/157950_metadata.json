GOP confident about Ryan's budget\n\nPassing Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s budget? No sweat.\n\nHouse Republican leaders said they believe they turned a corner by the end of last week, quashing opposition to the Wisconsin Republican\u2019s 2015 budget proposal and laying the groundwork to clear one of the last major pieces of legislation before the midterm election.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAfter weeks of whipping, multiple senior Republican lawmakers and aides say they are in as good shape as they have ever been and believe they are close to the requisite votes for passage.\n\n\u201cYeah, we\u2019re good,\u201d said Ryan, who chairs the House Budget Committee, while walking into the House chamber Friday.\n\n( WATCH: Jake Sherman on \u2018Driving the Day\u2019)\n\nHouse Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said his \u201conly problem\u201d is that three House Republicans from Georgia are battling one another in a Senate primary and will not vote for the budget.\n\n\u201cI predict a win,\u201d McCarthy told POLITICO.\n\nFor a time last week, Ryan\u2019s budget encountered problems as conservatives threatened to oppose the proposal to express frustration about a controversial parliamentary maneuver GOP leadership deployed to pass the \u201cdoc fix.\u201d Though it seems that leadership has minimized the opposition, Republicans privately concede that they\u2019ll most likely pass the 2015 budget by the slimmest margin in their four years in power.\n\n\u201cLook, this is all the same issues that came up in past years,\u201d said Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.), the chief deputy majority whip. \u201cThis is now viewed as something that identifies who we are. It\u2019s strongly identified with [House Republicans]. It\u2019ll pass.\u201d\n\nRyan\u2019s plan would cut $5 trillion in federal spending over the next decade, bringing the budget into balance by 2024, although Democrats have asserted the GOP claim is off by tens of billions of dollars.\n\nA large portion of the savings Ryan\u2019s budget projects comes from reducing health care coverage and subsidies under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. An additional $700 billion-plus in savings comes from slashing Medicaid and other health care programs, while hundreds of billions in additional cuts come from food stamps, education and farm programs.\n\nRyan would cut Obamacare benefits but retain its tax increases and reductions in payments to providers. It would also turn Medicare into a voucher program \u2014 Republicans call it \u201cpremium support\u201d \u2014 for those who enroll in the program beginning in 2024.\n\nSpeaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and his fellow Republicans have passed Ryan budgets three times since taking over the House in 2010, but it is a tougher vote this year because lower revenue forecasts have made the cuts needed to eliminate the deficit that much tougher to enact.\n\nHouse Democrats will again unite in opposing the bill this year, predicted Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), which means Republicans will have to pass it on their own. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not going to lose anybody,\u201d Hoyer said in an interview.\n\nLast year, 10 Republicans voted against the Ryan budget. Right now, there are 233 Republicans serving in the House; 217 votes will be needed to pass the resolution.\n\nSince only GOP lawmakers will back the Ryan plan, the vote gives outsize influence to hard-liners inside the party. So far, they seem to be sticking with Ryan and Boehner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to have it balanced in nine instead of 10, because that\u2019s what we said last year,\u201d said Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), who said he is undecided. \u201cBut it\u2019s a lot better than 26 years, and so I recognize Republicans need to pass a budget. You can\u2019t bring it to the floor and let it fail. We\u2019d hand this agenda to the other side.\u201d\n\nWhile Democrats say the 2015 budget is a political albatross, Republicans consider it a victory. \u201cRunning out the clock\u201d has become a favorite phrase within House Republican circles.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senior Republican lawmakers and aides say they are in good shape.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Senior Republican lawmakers and aides say they are in good shape.", "title": "GOP confident about Ryan's budget", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/gop-confident-about-paul-ryans-budget-105412.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/08/01/031213_paul_ryan_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Republicans,Budget,Kevin McCarthy,Paul Ryan", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/Jakeshermanpolitico"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7584\"", "article_summary": "GOP confident about Ryan's budgetPassing Rep.
