Nelson of the Knoxville News Sentinel\n\nNicole Browning\u2019s 11-year-old son needed regular allergy shots, and the pediatrician he\u2019d seen since birth was retiring.\n\nWhen she started looking for a new doctor, she was surprised at how much harder it was to find one to take the TennCare policy he has now, as opposed to the private insurance she\u2019d had before her full-time teaching job was not renewed.\n\nThen another parent in her son\u2019s Scout troop told her about Cherokee Health Systems\u2019 Sevier County medical office in Seymour.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018You won\u2019t know things are any different than someone who walks in there with paid insurance,\u2019 \u201d Browning said. \u201cI said, \u2018OK. That\u2019s what I want.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNow Browning is happy enough with son Evan\u2019s care that she and her husband, who owns Browning\u2019s Mobile Marine, are thinking about switching to Cherokee for their own primary care.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lived here (in Seymour) 13 years,\u201d said Browning, who also substitute teaches and has a part-time retail job. \u201cI\u2019d never heard of it.\u201d\n\nCherokee operates such community health centers, providing primary care and behavioral health such as counseling, in 13 East Tennessee counties \u2014 and its open to all ages, regardless of their insurance status or ability to pay. On average, 40 percent of Cherokee\u2019s patients have TennCare/Medicaid, said CEO Dennis Freeman. Another 30 percent are uninsured; Cherokee charges them on a sliding scale. About 15 percent have Medicare, and the remainder have private insurance policies.\n\n\u201cWe see everybody,\u201d said regional Vice President Julia Pearce, \u201cbut once a community hears \u2018Cherokee,\u2019 they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, goodness \u2014 this is the group that takes folks that I\u2019m not going to be able to see, who can\u2019t pay.\u2019 \u2026 Other providers refer patients to us, especially uninsured.\u201d\n\nCherokee\u2019s 24 community health centers are among 187 in the state, operated by 26 federally funded organizations and serving some 367,000 people a year \u2014 including nearly 5,000 seasonal or migrant farmworkers and more than 15,000 homeless.\n\nPerception change\n\nAbout 84 percent of Tennessee community health centers\u2019 patients are at or below the federal poverty level; all but 4 percent of them are within 200 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nBut community health centers\u2019 reputation for serving mainly the underserved may be changing.\n\nDr. Geogy Thomas is medical director of Indian Mountain Clinic in Jellico, which has served that small community on the Kentucky border since the 1970s. It\u2019s operated by Dayspring Family Health Center, a community health center that also runs clinics in Clairfield, Tenn., and Williamsburg, Ky. About half of Indian Mountain\u2019s patients are TennCare or Kentucky Medicaid, and another 10 percent to 20 percent are uninsured.\n\nBut the clinic has built relationships in the community, and people come for continuity of care. Thomas sees multigenerational families.\n\n\u201cOver the years, community health centers have been known as the \u2018poor people\u2019s clinic,\u2019 and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case anymore,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cNow they know us as the provider who will be at my bedside when I\u2019m hurting or dying. \u2026 We still do home visits.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a name for that continuity of care: \u201cmedical home,\u201d where patients come for regular primary care. Having medical home cuts costs because it allows for management of chronic illnesses, health experts say, especially the ones endemic to rural East Tennessee: diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. That cuts down on emergency-room visits, which often come when disease is in such an advanced stage that treatment is more complicated and expensive.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to engage them in (their own) care, to have them be educated \u2026 so that they can make better choices \u2014 not just for themselves, but for the generations that they\u2019re raising,\u201d Pearce said.\n\nThat\u2019s such a goal of community health centers that the federal government certifies those who meet it as \u201cPatient-Centered Medical Homes.\u201d Both Indian Mountain and Cherokee are among the 41 percent of community health centers in Tennessee with that designation.\n\n\u2018Integrated\u2019 care\n\nCherokee also was one of the first in Tennessee to pioneer \u201cintegrated\u201d health, where primary-care and mental-health services are provided in the same setting, at the same time.\n\n\u201cThe behavioral health system that we have now has a lot of problems in terms of access,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cStigma is an issue. There are waiting lists every place. The model of care in traditional behavioral health is pretty time-intensive, maybe not very efficient.\u201d\n\nSo providing mental health services when people come in for primary care just makes sense, he adds: \u201cOur behavioral health issues are entwined with our health issues. If you\u2019ve got the behaviorist as part of the primary-care team, then you can intervene. We saw 64,289 different patients last year. And that was behavioral health access to that many people. It really is a better platform for delivering behavioral health.\u201d\n\nOver the past 10 years, the number of community health centers offering behavioral-health services has nearly tripled. Still, about 30 percent of Tennessee centers don\u2019t offer it.\n\nThomas said behavioral health is the \u201cmissing link\u201d at Indian Mountain.\n\n\u201cWe want to, but it\u2019s very costly to get into that,\u201d he said. The center applied for a federal grant to start behavioral health, but with nearly 1,200 such centers nationally, the grants are very competitive. Indian Mountain received another grant, to continue some quality measures it had implemented, but did not get that one, much to Thomas\u2019 disappointment.\n\nFunding challenges necessitate the clinic \u201cthinks outside the box,\u201d he said. A licensed practical nurse on staff provides clinical education, referrals and a type of case management to Indian Mountain patients. And though the clinic doesn\u2019t officially offer behavioral health, it still must deal with the issues surrounding chronic drug use, especially of prescription opiates and Suboxone, a drug marketed to help people stop abusing opiates, but which is itself routinely abused, Thomas said.\n\nTelemedicine\n\nIndian Mountain was seeing enough prenatal patients with drug abuse issues that it partnered with a high-risk obstetric practice at the University of Tennessee Medical Center. The clinic uses a telemedicine setup so its patients can see doctors at the UTMC practice who can perform ultrasounds remotely.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a profound intervention to help our patients,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt keeps our girls in our community so that they\u2019re not having to drive all the way into Knoxville\u201d \u2014 which in turn increases the likelihood they\u2019ll get appropriate prenatal care.\n\nCherokee also has made use of telemedicine, where patients in one of its clinics can see a primary-care doctor or a specialist in another.\n\n\u201cI was a little apprehensive the first time: \u2018You\u2019re going to what? On the TV? Where\u2019s the doctor?\u2019 \u201d Browning said. But \u201cit was really cool,\u201d Evan said. Using the attached otoscope, \u201cshe can see down your throat and up your nose.\u201d\n\nCherokee partners with Sevier County Schools; a telemedicine device in each school\u2019s nurse\u2019s office means Cherokee practitioners can see students in the school, doing strep and flu tests there.\n\n\u201cThat helps keep the kids in the schools, which helps the school retain some funds from the state because their attendance is higher,\u201d Pearce said. \u201cThen, the kids have access to care they might not necessarily receive otherwise. The parents love it because it\u2019s convenient: The pharmacy can be called, the prescription waiting for them as they come home from work. It saves times for parents, and they\u2019re not involved in having to take a day off to take their child to the doctor. It\u2019s been win-win-win, all around.\u201d\n\nFamiliar with programs like Skype and FaceTime, younger people have been quick to embrace telemedicine. But even older patients, like Robert Ruiz, 70, who saw a specialist through the telemedicine device, have grown to like the convenience the technology offers.\n\n\u201cIt was very good,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cEven though the doctor\u2019s not here, still you can talk to them.\u201d\n\nRuiz has private health insurance he buys; the policy offered through his bellman job at a downtown Knoxville hotel is \u201ctoo high,\u201d he said. He and his wife switched to Cherokee after another provider ceased taking their Humana policy, and he\u2019s been happy with their care, which includes managing both their diabetes and diagnosing and treating his sleep apnea.\n\nAbout 21 percent of the growing Sevier County population is uninsured, many of them seasonal workers who don\u2019t qualify for job-related benefits, Freeman said.\n\n\u201cVery few practices are able to accept uninsured people,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think access for people who have TennCare is difficult.\u201d\n\nThe ACA effect\n\nCherokee recently applied for and received a national Department of Health and Human Services grant for $650,000, which it will divide to expand services in Sevier County and in the Chattanooga area. Freeman said the money will be used to hire additional providers, serving an additional 5,000 patients at those two clinics. The Sevier center already has some evening hours.\n\nIt will also put Cherokee in a better position if Tennessee expands Medicaid to cover people who currently fall in the Affordable Care Act \u201cgap,\u201d Freeman said.\n\nBut Thomas said the Medicaid expansion has been a double-edged sword for the Indian Mountain clinic. Because Kentucky did expand Medicaid, many of the clinic\u2019s formerly uninsured patients now have policies, he said \u2014 yet find they have \u201castronomical deductibles\u201d that make their care less affordable than the sliding scale the clinic charged when they were uninsured.\n\n\u201cThere are more people covered, but they\u2019re getting less care,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cI\u2019m seeing people forgo care, prolong the time between appointments, go without medicine. They won\u2019t even come in the door to get help.\u201d\n\nThose who do often try to cram as many services as possible into one visit, to avoid an additional co-pay, he said.\n\nA supporter of universal health care, Thomas said, he nonetheless sees that \u201cpeople are finding themselves in a difficult conundrum. I think the nation\u2019s going to have to face that: Have we really done well? Is it effective coverage?\u201d\n\nDr. Steve Dronen, medical director of the emergency department at LeConte Medicine Center, Sevier County\u2019s hospital, said he\u2019s seeing more patients come in with insurance, but they haven\u2019t always been educated on the best way to use it. Though a lot of LeConte\u2019s patients are tourists \u2014 up to 30 percent or higher during special events or holidays \u2014 he also estimates about a third of patients are there for primary-care services, while another third have issues that could have been handled in a doctor\u2019s office: medication refills; pregnancy tests; problems with managing chronic illnesses, like uncontrolled blood pressure or spiking blood sugar.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t discourage them from coming in, but it\u2019s better to have a doctor who knows you \u2014 it\u2019s more efficient care,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s an everyday occurrence for us, to try to inform people of what primary-care resources are available.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"title": "Changing the image of community health centers", "og": {"url": "http://www.knoxnews.com/news/local/changing-the-image-of-community-health-centers-ep-1115783249-362221151.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/communityhealth_02_al_19044073_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 432}, "type": "article", "description": "Federally funded community health centers haven't ever turned patients away, regardless of ability to pay.
