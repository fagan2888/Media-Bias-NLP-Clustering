Instead, women are left out in the cold,\u201d Richards wrote.\n\n\n\nHowever, according to research done by the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) and the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the education arm of the Susan B. Anthony List, community health clinics outnumber Planned Parenthood in states around the country and offer the same services and in some cases more services, including mammograms. The clinics, identified as those eligible for the same federal funding Planned Parenthood receives, do not perform abortions.\n\n\n\nIn Texas, for example, there were 38 Planned Parenthood clinics and 732 community health care centers at the time the maps were posted on the Family Research Council\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\n\nIn Pennsylvania, community health care centers number 326 compared to the 37 Planned Parenthood clinics. In New York, Planned Parenthood has 58 clinics, but there are 625 community health care centers.\n\n\n\nThe data shows there are nationwide 13,540 clinics providing comprehensive health care for women, versus 665 Planned Parenthood clinics.\n\n\n\nAccording to its latest annual report, Planned Parenthood affiliated clinics performed 323,999 and received $553.7 million in government health services grants and reimbursements.\n\n\n\nA pro-life group has expressed outrage over the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)\u2019s decision to publish a commentary last week by Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards promoting access to birth control and abortifacients and the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider\u2019s vital role in providing that access.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "CNS News", "description": "A pro-life group has expressed outrage over the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)\u2019s decision to publish a commentary last week by Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards promoting access to birth control and abortifacients and the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider\u2019s vital role in providing that access.", "title": "Pro-Life Group Calls Medical Journal\u2019s Decision to Run Planned Parenthood\u2019s Commentary Shameful", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/penny-starr/pro-life-group-calls-medical-journals-decision-run-planned-parenthoods", "image": "//cdn.cnsnews.com/cecilerichards.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-08T16:08:21-05:00", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-08T15:37:52-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-08T16:08:21-05:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "A pro-life group has expressed outrage over the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)\u2019s decision to publish a commentary last week by Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards promoting access to birth control and abortifacients and the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider\u2019s vital role in providing that access.", "title": "Pro-Life Group Calls Medical Journal\u2019s Decision to Run Planned Parenthood\u2019s Commentary Shameful", "url": "http://cnsnews.com/news/article/penny-starr/pro-life-group-calls-medical-journals-decision-run-planned-parenthoods", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.cnsnews.com/cecilerichards.jpg"}, "site": "@cnsnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "A pro-life group has expressed outrage over the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)\u2019s decision to publish a commentary last week by Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards promoting access to birth control and abortifacients and the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider\u2019s vital role in providing that access.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The data shows there are nationwide 13,540 clinics providing comprehensive health care for women, versus 665 Planned Parenthood clinics.\nIn Pennsylvania, community health care centers number 326 compared to the 37 Planned Parenthood clinics.\nIn New York, Planned Parenthood has 58 clinics, but there are 625 community health care centers.\nThe clinics, identified as those eligible for the same federal funding Planned Parenthood receives, do not perform abortions.\nAccording to its latest annual report, Planned Parenthood affiliated clinics performed 323,999 and received $553.7 million in government health services grants and reimbursements."}
