One student who survived the ordeal told reporters he heard a TTP gunmen yell, \u201cA lot of the children are under the benches\u2026Kill them!\u201d\n\nPakistan is all too familiar with the horrors of terrorism, but today\u2019s assault directed specifically at children represents a new level of depravity by the TTP.\n\nPakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has declared three days of mourning and announced an emergency meeting of all political parties for Wednesday. The Pakistani foreign ministry has called the terrorists \u201cenemies of Pakistan, enemies of Islam and enemies of humanity.\u201d\n\nPakistani politician Imran Khan, who has been leading protests against Nawaz Sharif\u2019s rule, recently criticized the army\u2019s operations in the tribal areas and called on the government to negotiate with the TTP\u2014a position likely to be viewed as reckless and futile by most Pakistanis following today\u2019s dastardly attack.\n\nThe Pakistan military has been conducting offensive operations against the TTP in TTP\u2019s hideouts in North Waziristan since June. The operations have resulted in the death of 1,800 militants, according to Pakistani Army officials.\n\nIn a visit to the U.S. in late November, Pakistani Chief of Army Staff Raheel Sharif said he was making no distinction between different terrorist groups and had ordered operations against any and all militants in the region. U.S. military officials have confirmed that the Pakistani Army operations in North Waziristan are helping to disrupt the activities of not only the TTP, but also groups that operate in Afghanistan, such as the Haqqani network.\n\nAlthough Washington and Islamabad have had past differences on how best to counter terrorism in the region, the U.S. must continue to shore up Pakistan with both civilian and military aid in its fight against terrorism.\n\nFor its part, Pakistan must respond positively to the olive branch being extended by the leader of Afghanistan\u2019s new Unity Government, President Ashraf Ghani. Ghani has signaled he wants to turn a new leaf in relations and cooperate with Islamabad to counter regional terrorism that threatens both their nations.\n\nPakistan\u2019s civilian and military leaders must come together to address the existential threat that terrorism poses. Part of this effort must involve undermining the ideology that drives all militancy in the region. Only a comprehensive and consistent policy against terrorism and the ideology behind it will keep Pakistani children safe in the future.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pakistan\u2019s leadership must do what is necessary to rid the nation of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, the group claiming responsibility for today\u2019s attack.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Pakistan\u2019s leadership must do what is necessary to rid the nation of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, the group claiming responsibility for today\u2019s attack.", "title": "Pakistani Nation Must Unite Against Terrorists Following Attack on Schoolchildren", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/upiphotostwo352775.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1uVUmfc"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Pakistan\u2019s leadership must do what is necessary to rid the nation of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, the group claiming responsibility for today\u2019s attack.", "title": "Pakistani Nation Must Unite Against Terrorists Following Attack on Schoolchildren", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/upiphotostwo352775.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2014-12-16T17:31:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "pakistan, pakistan attack, school attack, terrorism, pakistan school attack,"}, "article_summary": "Only a comprehensive and consistent policy against terrorism and the ideology behind it will keep Pakistani children safe in the future.\nThe operations have resulted in the death of 1,800 militants, according to Pakistani Army officials.\nThe Pakistan military has been conducting offensive operations against the TTP in TTP\u2019s hideouts in North Waziristan since June.\nPakistan\u2019s civilian and military leadership must do what is necessary to rid the nation of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP, the Pakistani Taliban), the group claiming responsibility for today\u2019s abominable attack on a Pakistani school that left more than 100 children dead.\nPakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has declared three days of mourning and announced an emergency meeting of all political parties for Wednesday."}
