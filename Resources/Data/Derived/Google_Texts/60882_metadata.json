Officer Jason Van Dyke is charged with first-degree murder in the death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, who appeared in the video to be walking away from Van Dyke as he was shot.\n\nThe footage \u2014 ordered released by a judge and made public hours after Van Dyke was charged \u2014 set off a chain of events that captured the attention of the country. Days of protests and marches followed the video\u2019s release, including one that on the busiest shopping day of the year partially shut down the city\u2019s most famous shopping district, Michigan Avenue.\n\nA few days later, Emanuel announced that he had demanded and received the resignation of Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, created a new task force for police accountability and expanded the use of body cameras.\n\nBut the anger did not subside, and every day there seemed to be another issue. There was the release of hundreds of pages of documents that show police had described in their reports a far more threatening McDonald than the teen the city and the world had seen on the video.\n\nThe situation became so volatile that Emanuel was forced to do something he rarely does: backtrack. After initially saying that a federal probe of the department would be \u201cmisguided\u201d because the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office was already examining the McDonald shooting, Emanuel later said he welcomed such an investigation.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced a Justice Department civil rights investigation to determine if there are patterns of racial disparity in the police department\u2019s use of force.\n\nEmanuel then said the city would stop fighting the release of a second video that showed a police officer shooting a man in the back. That video was released Monday during a presentation in which Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Anita Alvarez said her office would not charge the officer.\n\nLater that night, the city released yet another video, that one showing an inmate being dragged out of his cell by his handcuffed wrists. While a police review board previously found the officers\u2019 actions justified, Emanuel said he did not see how the treatment of the man \u2014 who later died following a reaction to an antipsychotics drug \u2014 could \u201cpossibly be acceptable\u201d and said he did not consider the investigation closed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has called a special City Council meeting to discuss the police department that's now at the center of the biggest crisis of his administration.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has called a special City Council meeting to discuss the police department that\u2019s now at the center of the biggest crisis of his administration.", "title": "Rahm Emanuel to speak about Chicago police department", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/9/rahm-emanuel-speak-about-chicago-police-department/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/07/Killings_By_Police_Chicago.JPEG-0d220.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/07/Killings_By_Police_Chicago.JPEG-0d220.jpg", "description": "Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has called a special City Council meeting to discuss the police department that's now at the center of the biggest crisis of his administration.", "card": "summary", "title": "Rahm Emanuel to speak about Chicago police department"}, "Author": "Don Babwin", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Rahm Emanuel"}, "article_summary": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has called a special City Council meeting to discuss the police department that\u2019s now at the center of the biggest crisis of his administration.\nAfter initially saying that a federal probe of the department would be \u201cmisguided\u201d because the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office was already examining the McDonald shooting, Emanuel later said he welcomed such an investigation.\nA few days later, Emanuel announced that he had demanded and received the resignation of Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, created a new task force for police accountability and expanded the use of body cameras.\nLater that night, the city released yet another video, that one showing an inmate being dragged out of his cell by his handcuffed wrists.\nOfficer Jason Van Dyke is charged with first-degree murder in the death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, who appeared in the video to be walking away from Van Dyke as he was shot."}
