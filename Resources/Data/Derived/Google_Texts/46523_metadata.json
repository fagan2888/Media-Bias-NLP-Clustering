Energy costs slid 2.8% for a second straight month, but the yearly decline slowed to 6.5% vs. 12.6% in December and 18.4% in September, as comparisons get tougher.\n\nCore prices were driven by gains in the cost of medical care, health insurance and housing, including lodging away from home.\n\nHealth insurance costs rose 1.1% for the month and 4.8% from a year ago \u2014 the biggest increase since April 2013, before the ObamaCare exchanges were launched. Although subsidies help reduce the prices, inflation measures take into account the added government costs as well. Despite rising premiums, UnitedHealth (UNH), Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM) have warned of losses in the exchanges, with UnitedHealth the most explicit about possibly exiting the market if conditions don\u2019t improve.\n\nThe cost of medical care rose 0.5% in January, bringing the yearly increase to 3%, tied for the highest since early 2013. Prescription drug companies such as Gilead Sciences (GILD)and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) have been under fire for high costs, but the annual rise in prescription costs has decelerated to 3% from 6.4% at the end of 2014.\n\nThe cost of medical service rose 0.5% for the month and 3.3% from a year ago, the biggest annual rise since April 2013.\n\nRent of primary residence rose 0.3% in January and 3.7% from a year ago, matching December\u2019s annual gain for the biggest since June 2008.\n\nLodging away from home, which sees volatile swings from month to month, rose 2% in January and 3.1% for the year.\n\nAll items excluding food, shelter and energy still were up a more moderate 1.5% from a year ago.\n\nThe core inflation rate has risen above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. But the Fed pays more attention to another price gauge, the core PCE deflator, which has shown little pickup in recent months.\n\nUnitedHealth shares fell fractionally on the stock market today in morning trade. Aetna, Humana and Gilead Sciences fell 1.3%. Valeant Pharmaceuticals tumbled 7.6% after Wells Fargo downgraded the drugmaker, saying there are \u201ctoo many questions.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The increase in core prices was driven by gains in the cost of medical care, health insurance and housing including lodging away from home.", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.3% in January and 2.2% from a year ago, the fastest annual rise since June 2012, the Labor Department said.
