Happily for the GOP, two Midwestern governors are running for their party\u2019s nomination.\n\nBoth won reelection in 2014. The one from the state with more electoral votes won with 64 percent of the vote with wide appeal to Democrats and independents. The one from the smaller state got just 52 percent of the vote after a divisive campaign.\n\nThe former fought to have his state accept the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion. He made his case on moral grounds, arguing that at heaven\u2019s door, Saint Peter is \u201cprobably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small. But he is going to ask you what you did for the poor.\u201d\n\nThe latter adamantly opposed expanding Medicaid under the ACA, and his speeches are compendiums of every right-wing bromide party activists demand. \u201cWe need a president who \u2014 on the first day in office \u2014 will call on Congress to pass a full repeal of Obamacare,\u201d this hopeful declared when he announced his candidacy last week. \u201cNext, we need to rein in the federal government\u2019s out-of-control regulations that are like a wet blanket on the economy.\u201d And on he went.\n\nNow: Guess which one is seen as a top contender, and which is dismissed as the darkest of dark horses? Which one was running third behind only Jeb Bush and Donald Trump in the Real Clear Politics poll average as of Sunday, and which one was in 12th place with all of 1.5 percent?\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is a Republican contender for president. Here's his take on border security, tax reform and same-sex marriage, in his own words. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nYou have no doubt figured out that I\u2019m talking about John Kasich of Ohio, who is expected to announce his candidacy on Tuesday, and Scott Walker of Wisconsin. It\u2019s telling about the contemporary Republican party: Kasich would probably be the better bet in the general election but barely registers in the surveys, while Walker has the better chance of winning the nomination.\n\nIt\u2019s preposterous to see Kasich as anything but a conservative. He was a drill sergeant for Newt Gingrich\u2019s Republican Revolution in the 1990s. When Kasich was chairman of the House Budget Committee, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d produced a segment about him titled \u201cThe Axman Cometh.\u201d As governor, Kasich pushed big tax cuts that included repealing the estate tax. (The Republican obsession with protecting large fortunes is beyond me.) He also took on the unions with what was known as Senate Bill 5 to end collective bargaining for public employees.\n\nAnd it\u2019s on the labor question that the Kasich and Walker stories diverge, in large part because of the accident of state election laws. In Ohio, the unions could put Bill 5 directly to the voters, and they repealed it in 2011 by a 61-percent-to-39-percent landslide. A chastened Kasich recalibrated.\n\nWalker is best known for a very similar attack on public employee unions, but Wisconsin had no provision for a comparable referendum. The unions felt they had no choice but to organize a recall of Walker. Voters typically don\u2019t take well to recalls that aren\u2019t a reaction to outright skullduggery and corruption. Walker prevailed, and he\u2019s been bragging about busting unions and surviving ever since. Conservatives love him for it.\n\nKasich, by contrast, reached out to his previous enemies. When he was endorsed by the Carpenters Union last year, Kasich said: \u201cFor too long, there\u2019s been a disconnect between people like me and organized labor.\u201d Walker is as likely to say something like this as he is to sing a rousing chorus of \u201cSolidarity Forever.\u201d\n\nWhen Kasich talks about his time as governor, as he did to my Post colleague Michael Gerson last year, the things he brags about include his work on autism, mental illness and drug addiction. He notes \u2014 the Almighty again \u2014 that all his constituents \u201care made in the image of God.\u201d\n\nYou can tell Kasich knows he will have to run a rebel\u2019s campaign because he has hired rebellious Republican consultants, including John Weaver, John McCain\u2019s campaign strategist who feuded famously with Karl Rove, and Fred Davis, who specializes in offbeat (and sometimes controversial) political commercials.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich is a potential contender for the Republican nomination for president in 2016. Here's where he stands on the Iran deal, marriage, health care for the mentally ill and more, in his own words. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nKasich\u2019s poll standing might well exclude him from one or more of the early debates. That would be a shame. Perhaps there should be a Midwest debate bracket. A Kasich-Walker confrontation would be especially enlightening.\n\n\u201cI have a little bit of a different message here,\u201d Kasich said at a Republican Governors Association meeting last year. Indeed he does. It\u2019s probably why he can\u2019t win. It\u2019s also why his party needs to listen.\n\nRead more from E.J.
