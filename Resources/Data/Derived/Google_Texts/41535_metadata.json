John Thune John ThuneOvernight Tech: Rubio, Cruz take up internet domain fight Pressure builds from GOP to delay internet domain transition Overnight Tech: Facebook finds no bias but vows to change trending feature MORE (R-S.D.) urged President Obama Tuesday not to exempt unions from ObamaCare taxes.\n\nHe and 10 other Senate Republicans introduced the Union Tax Fairness Act, S. 1724, which would prevent the administration from exempting union healthcare plans from the ObamaCare reinsurance tax.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cUnions should not be granted a special exemption from ObamaCare\u2019s reinsurance tax just because the president fears further union backlash on his signature law,\u201d Thune said. \u201cRather than granting special backroom deals to political allies, the administration should support fairness for all by permanently delaying the law for every American.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have called for a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 also known as ObamaCare \u2014 but Thune said the president could at least agree to delay implementation of the law to ensure fairness.\n\nThe ObamaCare reinsurance tax is scheduled to begin in 2014 and requires all self-insured plans to pay a tax for each person covered under a health plan. This is aimed at incentivizing people and businesses to go onto the healthcare exchange instead of buying a self-insured plan.\n\nThune\u2019s bill would prevent Obama from exempting union from the reinsurance tax. He said unions, who originally supported the law, are now asking the administration for special exemptions because they don\u2019t want members to pay for benefits that go to non-union workers as well.\n\nGOP Sens. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Orrin Hatch (Utah), James Inhofe (Okla.), David Vitter (La.), Mike Enzi (Wyo.), Ron Johnson (Wis.), John Barrasso (Wyo.), Tim Scott (S.C.), Saxby Chambliss (Ga.), and Tom Coburn (Okla.) are cosponsoring Thune\u2019s bill.\n\nThe senators said they introduced the bill because of media reports that Obama was considering an executive order to exempt unions from the tax.\n\n\u201cThe White House doesn\u2019t have the authority to change the law on its own and, as this bill makes clear, any attempt at a Big Labor carve out from ObamaCare must be approved by Congress,\u201d Hatch said.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sen.
