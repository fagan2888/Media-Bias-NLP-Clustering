While companies have no plans to bring back pensions, they are increasingly looking for better ways to help workers prepare for their retirements.\n\nRelated: Social Security Ruling Drives Up Medicare Costs for Millions\n\n\u201cWith more workers falling short of their retirement savings needs, employers are being more aggressive about making plan design changes that will help workers close the savings gap,\u201d Rob Austin, director of retirement research at Aon Hewitt, said in a statement. \u201cWhile these tweaks to the plan may seem small, they can have a profound impact on workers\u2019 ultimate retirement wealth.\u201d\n\nHere are three ways companies are changing their retirement benefits to help workers save more, according to a new analysis by Aon Hewitt.\n\n1. They\u2019re upping their match. More than 40 percent of companies now match worker contributions dollar-for-dollar, up to a certain limit. That\u2019s up from less than a third of companies in 2013, when it was more common for employers to contribute $0.50 per employee dollar.\n\n2. They\u2019re setting a higher auto-enrollment contribution amount. More than half of companies now automatically enroll workers at a savings rate of 4 percent or more, compared to 39 percent of companies in 2013. More than half of companies have the default level at or above the company-match threshold.\n\n3. They\u2019re increasingly \u201cback-sweeping.\u201d A growing number of companies automatically enroll all eligible employees (rather than just new hires) in the company 401(k). This year, 16 percent of companies practice back-sweeping, twice the percentage that did so two years ago.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s no secret that many Americans are anxious about having a financially secure retir", "title": "3 Ways to Close the Retirement Savings Gap", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/22/3-Ways-Close-Retirement-Savings-Gap", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09272012_retirement_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/22/3-Ways-Close-Retirement-Savings-Gap", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09272012_retirement_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It\u2019s no secret that many Americans are anxious about having a financially secure retir", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Social Security Ruling Drives Up Medicare Costs for Millions\u201cWith more workers falling short of their retirement savings needs, employers are being more aggressive about making plan design changes that will help workers close the savings gap,\u201d Rob Austin, director of retirement research at Aon Hewitt, said in a statement.\nWhile companies have no plans to bring back pensions, they are increasingly looking for better ways to help workers prepare for their retirements.\n\u201cWhile these tweaks to the plan may seem small, they can have a profound impact on workers\u2019 ultimate retirement wealth.\u201dHere are three ways companies are changing their retirement benefits to help workers save more, according to a new analysis by Aon Hewitt.\nMuch of that anxiety reflects a shift from pensions toward 401(k) plans as the standard retirement benefit offered by employers over the past few decades.\nMore than half of companies now automatically enroll workers at a savings rate of 4 percent or more, compared to 39 percent of companies in 2013."}
