California State Senator Ricardo Lara (D-Bell Gardens) has introduced a bill to give undocumented immigrants in the state access to free or subsidized healthcare.

Undocumented Californians currently do not qualified for Medi-Cal, or health insurance coverage under Covered California, the state-run health exchanged launched under the Affordable Care Act.

Senate Bill 1005, or the Health For All Act, would set up a separate health marketplace under Covered California to sell insurance plans to undocumented immigrants who donâ€™t qualify for Medi-Cal. The bill would also expand Medi-Cal so that undocumented immigrants who make under 138 percent of the poverty level -- about $32,000 a year for a family of four -- could receive that benefit.

There are an estimated 2 to 2.5 million undocumented immigrants in California, an estimated 1 million of them are uninsured. No word yet on how the bill would be funded; Lara said his office is working to come up with how much the proposal would cost taxpayers. Proponents of the proposal say the bill would save the state on healthcare costs in the long run.
