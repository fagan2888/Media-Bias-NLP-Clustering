The TC native was crowned \u201cMr. Soccer\u201d as Michigan\u2019s best high school player, graduated from an Ivy League college, served as National Public Radio\u2019s World Cup soccer correspondent, and reported from the front lines of Ebola in Sierra Leone. Yet he comes home, returning each summer to lead a youth soccer camp. The Ticker talked with him about his career, danger, and his love of \u201cthe great game.\u201d\n\nTicker: Tell us about your job and where it\u2019s taken you.\n\nKelto: It\u2019s been kind of crazy. I had been contracted by National Geographic during the 2010 World Cup, but the project got canceled. I wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted to do next, but I really wanted to go. So I reached out to a bunch of people in the media\u2026and I was hired on by NPR.\n\nThen I went back to Capetown for one more year as regular contributor\u2026and then was contacted by PRI [Public Radio International] and \u201cThe World.\u201d I eventually got hired by PRI as an Africa correspondent and ended up traveling Africa quite a bit, reporting on all sorts of things. Then last year I was hired by NPR for a position here in in Washington DC.\n\nTicker: So what was the most dangerous assignment you\u2019ve had?\n\nKelto: Probably Sierra Leone during the Ebola crisis. It was a weird combination of excitement and terror. It was a huge news story, but at the same time I\u2019m reading every day about the disease and what it does and how easy it is to catch. So I just read everything I could get my hands on from the medical side and concluded if I take proper precautions, it would actually be safer than driving in a car every day\u2026but it was a trip. I was literally on the other side of a plastic tarp from dozens of people dying of Ebola.\n\nThe other wild place was Zimbabwe for the presidential election. It was the notoriously despotic Mugabe regime.\n\nTicker: Do you find Americans have lots of misperceptions about Africa?\n\nKelto: Yes. A lot of people probably think of warlords and car checkpoints where you get robbed. I think it probably is safer and more stable than most people imagine. That said, it totally depends on what country you\u2019re in. And if you stay there long enough, you will get mugged; it\u2019s sort of a right of passage.\n\nI once got shaken down by a cop in Kenya with an AK-47. He claimed I was in violation, but I wasn\u2019t; he just wanted money. There\u2019s a lot of petty crime and corruption, but it\u2019s not people starving in the desert and warlords everywhere.\n\nTicker: One of your most recent stories about the \u201cmonkey island\u201d in Puerto Rico was pretty fascinating.\n\nKelto: That was the most fun place I\u2019ve traveled recently. My main purpose there was to report how the Affordable Care Act was affecting Puerto Rico. But as I was researching, I learned about this fascinating place; no one I talked to had every heard of it. It was a bizarre trip; going there was more difficult than Sierra Leone because to go onto the island, you have to get tested and prove you\u2019re immunized. It\u2019s a colony of 1,500 monkeys on a closed community on a small island, and disease would spread quickly and 80 years of research would be lost, so there was a lengthy briefing beforehand.\n\nTicker: So how does soccer fit into all this?\n\nKelto: Soccer is my first love. It\u2019s just a thing I took to and completely fell in love with at a very early age. I played in high school and won \u201cMr. Soccer,\u201d and was selected to an under-17 national team\u2026and eventually had a long and successful career.\n\nTicker: And you still come home for the camp?\n\nKelto: I started the camp when I was in college with one of my best friends from Ann Arbor. It evolved into something more formal by 1998 and I\u2019ve continued to run it every summer since then with the help of an incredible staff of local coaches, some of whom I played with growing up. It\u2019s extremely fun for the kids; they learn a lot but there are also games and competition. At this point we\u2019ve probably taught 4,000 kids. I\u2019ve just never been able to quit.\n\nKelto\u2019s Mr. Soccer camps are July 27-31 at TBAYS Fields in Traverse City.
