And Bender was even serenaded by three judges singing \u201cHey, Mike Bender\u201d (more on that later).\n\nBender retired from the job he loved on Tuesday, his 72nd birthday. The Colorado constitution mandates that judicial officers retire at 72.\n\nThe party was held in the lobby of the Ralph Carr Judicial Center, the new home of the Supreme Court and the attorney general, which opened in December 2012.\n\nAmong those present: Attorney General John Suthers; Rep. Beth McCann, D-Denver, who at one time was chair of the House Judiciary Committee; former Chief Justice Mary Mullarkey and Robert Hyatt, who just retired as chief judge of the Denver District Court. He joked it was rough getting back into a suit and tie again.\n\nThe highlight of the night came when state court administrator Jerry Marroney called Court of Appeal judges James Casebolt, Diana Terry and Rich Gabriel to the stage to serenade the retired chief with \u201cHey, Mike Bender\u201d a la \u201cHey, Big Spender.\u201d The party-goers loved the song, which noted that U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor dedicated the Ralph Carr building.\n\nHey Mike Bender\n\n(To the tune of Hey, Big Spender, new lyrics by Judge Diana Terry)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Beth McCann,Bill Cadman,John Suthers,Michael Bender,Ralph Carr,Sonia Sotomayor", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "A who's who in Colorado's political and legal worlds showed up to give retiring Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael Bender a proper send off.", "title": "Colorado says goobye to retiring Chief Justice Michael Bender", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/01/11/michael-bender-chief-justice-retiremen/104698/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2014/01/IMG_6004-001.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "A who's who in Colorado's political and legal worlds showed up to give retiring Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael Bender a proper send off.", "title": "Colorado says goodbye to retiring Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael Bender", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2014/01/11/michael-bender-chief-justice-retiremen/104698/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2014/01/IMG_6004-001.jpg", "creator": "@lynn_bartels", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "A who's who in Colorado's political and legal worlds showed up to give retiring Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael Bender a proper send off."}, "article_summary": "A who\u2019s who in Colorado\u2019s political and legal worlds showed up Friday night to give retiring Supreme Court Chief Justice Michael Bender a proper send off.\nAnd Bender was even serenaded by three judges singing \u201cHey, Mike Bender\u201d (more on that later).\nHey Mike Bender(To the tune of Hey, Big Spender, new lyrics by Judge Diana Terry)\nBender retired from the job he loved on Tuesday, his 72nd birthday.\nThe party was held in the lobby of the Ralph Carr Judicial Center, the new home of the Supreme Court and the attorney general, which opened in December 2012."}
