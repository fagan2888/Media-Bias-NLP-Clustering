To help her run her campaign, she enlisted family and friends.\n\nYasinow did what any serious candidate would do. She engaged voters, planned and hosted campaign events and solidified a platform.\n\nJUST WATCHED Roundtable: Obamacare and 2014 elections Replay More Videos ...

But she had checked all the boxes of a traditional campaign.\n\nShe ultimately won, but an aspect of modern campaigning was missing and not within her reach.\n\nDaunting for the political novice and attorney was creating an online presence.\n\nWhile the millennial is an avid user of social media and the Web, she had no idea how to build a website, calling it \"completely overwhelming.\" Plus, she didn't have the time or campaign cash to maintain it and update it.\n\n\"I tried to set up a website and it's not something that's easy to do,\" she said, acknowledging that a candidate must have a social presence to engage voters.\n\nBusinesses and brands are much more successful when there's a website. It's no different for political candidates.\n\nObama perfected it, but many left out\n\nWhile the 2012 presidential race was a $1 billion campaign and most Senate and House races are multi-million-dollar episodes featuring an interactive website, it's not in the cards for most running for some 550,000 state and local elected positions around the country.\n\nThat's what the founders of Democracy.com set out to change, believing that an online presence will level the playing field for candidates, regardless of economic and political background and experience.\n\nDemocracy.com is the \"social network for politics,\" founder Talmage Cooley said during a recent interview.\n\nHe thought of the idea while attending the Harvard Kennedy School where he worked to find a solution to the abundance of money in politics and a flawed campaign finance system, which is steeped in political agendas with little chance of being reformed anytime soon.\n\n\"The only thing left was the marketplace of voter opinion,\" Cooley said.\n\nHe noted that many candidates still didn't have an online presence in 2012, four years after Barack Obama revolutionized the use of the Web to mobilize supporters.\n\nCooley formed a team with expertise in politics, tech and business, and received investor support to create a Facebook-type website for political candidates.\n\n\"For the first time, [candidates] can have an Obama quality\" Web presence,\" Cooley, a former Wall Street bond trader and filmmaker, said -- and at no cost.\n\n'Democratizing democracy'\n\nThe portal includes every political office -- from school board in Belfast, Maine, to President of the United States. All candidates have to do is \"claim\" their profile and then it's theirs to advertise campaign events, list their platform and raise money.\n\nIt's how we can \"democratize democracy,\" Ray Rivera, the organization's co-founder and former Obama campaign organizer and state director.\n\nCooley said his goal is to \"to see that elections are accessible to everyone.\" He thinks he is doing just that by removing a significant technological and financial barrier.\n\nEven the most obscure candidates representing obscure political parties can have a profile on Demcoracy.com.\n\nYasinow agrees. \"It levels the playing field and encourages qualified individuals to run for office,\" she said.\n\nWillingboro, New Jersey Town Councilman Nathaniel Anderson said Democracy.com enabled him to reach voters he normally wouldn't be able to, especially on the fundraising front.\n\n\"I would normally target relationships I already had,\" Anderson said of his 2013 re-election campaign. He said the public didn't donate to his campaign before he opened his profile, but then said, \"I was reaching a wider universe\" as voters took advantage of the donation mechanism on his Democracy.com profile.\n\nCooley also said he couldn't believe that in 2012 candidate information for voters still couldn't be found in one place.\n\nSo for the voter, it's one-stop-shopping.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Prime shopping season might be underway this holiday season, but candidate shopping might be a little easier for voters next campaign season.", "pubdate": "2013-11-27T19:47:31Z", "author": "By Leigh Ann Caldwell, CNN", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Prime shopping season might be underway this holiday season, but candidate shopping might be a little easier for voters next campaign season.", "pubdate": "2013-11-27T19:47:31Z", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/27/politics/facebook-for-politics/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131126205641-ac-cnn-poll-00014929-t3-entertainment.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/131126205641-ac-cnn-poll-00014929-t3-entertainment.jpg", "source": "CNN", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/27/politics/facebook-for-politics/index.html"}, "keywords": "politics, One stop shopping for candidates online - CNNPolitics.com", "lastmod": "2013-11-27T19:47:31Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e60\"", "article_summary": "Cooley formed a team with expertise in politics, tech and business, and received investor support to create a Facebook-type website for political candidates.\nIt's how we can \"democratize democracy,\" Ray Rivera, the organization's co-founder and former Obama campaign organizer and state director.\nIt's no different for political candidates.\nHe noted that many candidates still didn't have an online presence in 2012, four years after Barack Obama revolutionized the use of the Web to mobilize supporters.\nDaunting for the political novice and attorney was creating an online presence."}
