The new policy has no restrictions, welcoming visitors at all times, limited solely by patient preference and clinical status.\n\nThe findings were overwhelmingly positive. Researchers noted the new open-door visitation policy improved overall family satisfaction with visiting hours as well as fostering a more positive experience in waiting rooms. Nurses were able to notice a positive upswing in visitor satisfaction and reported no decrease in their own satisfaction.\n\n\u201cThe waiting room used to be a place families were shuffled into, but now it can become a place to clear your head,\u201d says Brown.\n\nMany hospitals are beginning to rethink their dated visitation policies, moving toward a more patient-friendly, open visitation system. With no new risk found in the study, the argument for open visitation is hard to ignore.\n\n\u201cI see hospitals moving toward the morally correct choice,\u201d says Brown. \u201cMore and more hospitals are realizing we can\u2019t keep excluding the loved ones of our patients. It\u2019s a delicate time for people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Improving patient and family satisfaction is on the minds of hospitals and health systems across the country, and, according to one study, developing more flexible visitation policies that focus on individual patient needs is a smart place to begin.
