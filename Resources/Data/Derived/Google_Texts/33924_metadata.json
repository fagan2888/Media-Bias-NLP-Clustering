But whether President Obama\u2019s signature health care law survives -- at least in its entirety -- remains uncertain.\n\nDespite House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and other ardent supporters of ObamaCare declaring that it remains \u201cthe law of the land,\u201d other congressional Democrats facing re-election this year have hinted at cannibalizing the legislation in the face of a confused and frustrated electorate.\n\nIn early November, 39 House Democrats, including many in battleground districts, voted to allow millions of Americans to keep the health care plans they lost under ObamaCare, joining Republicans who have rigorously opposed the 2010 law since then-presidential candidate Obama proposed it in 2007.\n\nWeeks after the recent House vote, Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., among the most vulnerable Senate Democrats and who had roughly 90,000 people in her home state get their insurance revoked, also broke with her party by introducing a similar bill.\n\nYet the broader issue looming beyond the politics is whether the entire, federally subsidized program can become self-sustainable by getting enough enrollees, preferably younger Americans, or fall into what critics are calling the \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d\n\nTheir argument is that the administration will need millions of younger, healthy Americans to sign up to cover the costs of older enrollees who typically need more medical care. And without the young and healthy, insurance companies will increase prices to cover their losses, which will result in fewer enrollees and some sort of government intervention, the critics further argue.\n\n\u201cIf they do [succeed,] it'll be pure, irrational dumb luck,\u201d said Dan Holler of Heritage Action for America, which has helped lead efforts to \u201cdefund\u201d ObamaCare. \u201cThe program they designed, and the incentives they put in place, look destined to fail.\u201d\n\nHoller argued Tuesday that ObamaCare problems are systemic, with doctors eventually no longer accepting low reimbursements and Americans \u201crefusing to spend exorbitant amounts of money on plans that won't allow them to keep their doctor.\u201d\n\nHowever, the results of Kaiser Family Foundation study released last week suggest only a slight increase in insurance premiums in 2015, despite low enrollment so far by young people. (Rates are already locked in for 2014.)\n\n\"It is nowhere near what is sometimes referred to as a death spiral,\" Larry Levitt, a health economist at the foundation, said following the report's release, according to Reuters.\n\nPreliminary figures suggest roughly 25 percent of Americans who have so far signing up for ObamaCare are in the crucial 18-to-34 age group, below the administration's goal of roughly 40 percent.\n\nThe administration has said it needs to enroll roughly 7 million Americans by March 31, on its way to expanding coverage to 25 million by 2016.\n\nHowever, Levitt said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how many people sign up. What matters more is the proportions.\u201d\n\nAnd on Monday, Howard Dean -- a former Vermont governor, presidential candidate and Democratic National Committee chairman \u2013 suggested the so-called \"individual mandate\" in ObamaCare that requires Americans to purchase insurance or face a tax penalty might not have been needed for the program to be successful.\n\nHe told CNBC that actuarial data does not lead to the conclusion that huge cost overruns will result without the mandate.\n\n\"Insurance companies like it because it does bring young, healthy people who aren't likely to get sick into the system,\" he said. \"But our experience [in Vermont,] although it's with young people under 18, not with everybody, is that the individual mandate was not that necessary.\"", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/Health care,/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/White House", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-30 12:31:34 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "ObamaCare appears at least for now to be off life support -- after a total 2.1 million Americans enrolled to get insurance coverage this year.
