STEPHENVILLE, Texas (AP) — Jury selection is to begin Monday in the trial of the man accused of fatally shooting a former Navy SEAL who was depicted in the Oscar-nominated film “American Sniper.”

More than 260 potential jurors are set to report to district court in the Texas town of Stephenville, southwest of Fort Worth. Former Marine Eddie Ray Routh is charged with capital murder in the deaths of 38-year-old Chris Kyle and Kyle’s friend, 35-year-old Chad Littlefield, two years ago at a luxury resort’s shooting range in a rural area about 25 miles southeast of Stephenville. The trial is expected to start Wednesday.

The film “American Sniper” is based on Kyle’s 2012 memoir. He left the Navy in 2009 after four tours in Iraq.

Judge Jason Cashon told potential jurors during a jury qualification process last week that they wouldn’t be dismissed just for seeing the movie or reading the book.

Instead of a typical Erath County jury pool of 175, about 800 jury summonses were sent out, district clerk Wanda Pringle has said. Several hundred people who weren’t eliminated due to exemptions or other factors took part in last week’s screening. The group was narrowed during that process after potential jurors were dismissed for a variety of reasons, including some who said pretrial publicity had already led them to a decision in the case.
