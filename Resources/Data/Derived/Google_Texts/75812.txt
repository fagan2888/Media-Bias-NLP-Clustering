Nursing students enrolled at Sam Houston State University (SHSU) have been spending quality time with Montgomery County seniors.

This is the second semester where students interested in geriatrics and are studying for their BS degree in nursing have spent one morning each week communicating, serving lunch and giving educational presentations to seniors at Friendship Centers in Conroe, Willis, Montgomery and Magnolia.

“The purpose of this experience is to allow the students to recognize their role as a nurse in helping the seniors to continue to live independently, maintain their functional capacity and enhance their quality of life,” SHSU Instructor Susan Holland said.

Under supervision of an SHSU instructor, the student presentations included topics about home exercises, healthy cooking tips, brain exercises to help memory, improving balance and the affordable health care act.

The four-year nursing program at SHSU began in November of 2008. An important milestone was reached this year with the approval for accreditation from the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing. “The Friendship Center (TFC) was forging new territory by partnering with a university nursing program: both to gain future volunteers for TFC and to provide opportunities for the nursing students to work with senior adults. The relationship has been a huge success, and TFC is grateful for the enriching contributions of the nursing students“, said Susan Hawkins, Volunteer Coordinator for The Friendship Center.
