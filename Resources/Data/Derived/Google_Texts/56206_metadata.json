We have to stay alert. We have to stay on top of things,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to stay together and we have to keep it moving.\n\n\u201cI feel I\u2019m the better person to continue to make progress.\u201d\n\nQualifying for the October 24 election takes place Sept. 8-10. If a runoff election is necessary, it will happen Nov. 21.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/local/2015/08/16/carriere-runs-parish-council-seat/31822145/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Nancy Carriere is a first-time candidate for elected office.", "og": {"site_name": "DailyWorld.com", "description": "Nancy Carriere is a first-time candidate for elected office.", "title": "Carriere runs for parish council seat", "url": "http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/local/2015/08/16/carriere-runs-parish-council-seat/31822145/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/dailyworld.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nancy Carriere is a first-time candidate for elected office.", "title": "Carriere runs for parish council seat", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b506790d79e22ec0f7f788dc1b491251a706b8d6/c=110-0-1402-1292&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/16/Opelousas/B9318195239Z.1_20150816173414_000_GFABGKG2R.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=898315311", "fb": {"app_id": 164724483570611}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "Nancy Carriere is running for the District 2 seat on the St. Landry Parish Council against longtime incmbent Leon Robinson.\n\u201cSome identify more with the city of Opelousas than wth the parish,\u201d Carriere said.\n\u201cI feel I have a lot to contribute to the betterment of the parish,\u201d Carriere said.\n\u201cA lot of them didn\u2019t realize they had representation on the parish council,\u201d or had little idea about what it does.\nThe graduate of Leonville High School has driven school buses for the parish public schools since 1992."}
