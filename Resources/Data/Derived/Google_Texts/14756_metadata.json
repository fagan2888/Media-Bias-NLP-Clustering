According to Wired, the federal government is the \u201ccountry\u2019s largest creator of public domain code.\u201d Unsurprisingly, it is also very slow when it comes to sharing that code.\n\nHowever, on Thursday, April 10, NASA will release an overwhelmingly large amount of information in the form of a public software catalog.

NASA has participated in a technology transfer program for over 50 years. Despite this technology transfer it hasn\u2019t released much of its cutting-edge code.
