The services are generally available to people who earn less than 300 percent of the federal poverty level. That\u2019s $2,431 per month for an individual, or $4,969 for a family of four.\n\nThe Spokane Regional Health District wants to get the word out that it has money available for breast, cervical and colon cancer screenings.\n\nOver the past year, district officials have seen a puzzling drop in the number of clients served by the program, raising concerns that low-income community members aren\u2019t getting the screenings.\n\nEarly detection is key to successful treatment, said Donna Oliver, who manages the health district\u2019s breast, cervical and colon health program.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen it save lives over and over again,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople say, \u2018If it wasn\u2019t for this program, I wouldn\u2019t have gone to the doctor.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe district pays for mammograms, Pap smears and other diagnostic tests for the cancers. Most clients are women age 40 to 64, though colon screenings are also available for men. Individuals must meet income guidelines to qualify for assistance.\n\nOver the past year, the Spokane Regional Health District has seen the number of clients in the program plummet from about 150 per month to 20 per month in the nine-county region it serves.\n\nSome of the drop-off is probably the result of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, Oliver said. Most insurance plans now are required to cover the initial screenings at no out-of-pocket cost. But the magnitude of the drop in people seeking services through the health district is still worrisome, she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing what we think is the level of need out there,\u201d Oliver said.\n\nThe newly insured can also use the health district\u2019s program, which will pay for follow-up diagnostic tests after initial screenings for individuals who can\u2019t afford their deductible, Oliver said. If a mammogram detects a lump, for instance, the program can cover the cost of an ultrasound and biopsy.\n\nProviding assistance for people with high deductibles may be the biggest demand for program dollars in the future, said Claudia Bell, executive director of the Eastern Washington Affliate of the Susan G. Komen Foundation. The affiliate helps the health district fund the $210,000 annual program, which also receives state and federal dollars.\n\n\u201cPeople are buying the insurance they can afford,\u201d Bell said. For a low-income family with basic coverage, a $5,000 deductible \u201cmight as well be $5 million,\u201d she said.\n\nGetting people in for routine screenings is frequently a challenge, said Kathleen Wilson, chief operating officer for Inland Imaging, which has seven locations in the Spokane area, and also provides mobile services to outlying areas.\n\nThree years ago, Inland Imaging surveyed clients about why they put off getting their mammograms. The No. 1 reason cited by women was time.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the money,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThe women who responded said they didn\u2019t have time.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Spokane Regional Health District wants to get the word out that it has money available for breast, cervical and colon cancer screenings.
