(AP) - With North Dakota State enjoying a stretch of four straight national football titles since it moved up to Division I athletics, a group of NDSU athlete alumni decided it was time for Bison Nation to have a new sports bar.\n\nThe Herd & Horns bar and restaurant comes with something special: Lights, camera and action. A portable TV studio of sorts will serve as a real-world laboratory for the school\u2019s broadcast journalism students to learn how to do live sports talk shows and conduct interviews with players and coaches. The first show is scheduled to air in two weeks.\n\nRich Lodewyk, broadcast program director for the Bison Information Network, the school\u2019s TV studio, said the arrangement should benefit both his students and the customers.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be fun for the people who are having lunch and dinner there to witness a student-produced television show, and it gives our students great experience to learn about doing broadcast productions offsite,\u201d Lodewyk said.\n\nThe set is cleverly disguised as a long high-top table and chairs in the front corner of the bar. Slide some of the chairs aside in favor of a soundboard, TV monitor, wireless connections and mounted bright lights - and suddenly, it\u2019s show time.\n\n\u201cAll they have to do is plop their cameras in and they can do a show,\u201d said Brent Tehven, a former NDSU football and one of six owners.\n\nNDSU senior Nate Manning, the director of the school\u2019s TV network, said he expects die-hard fans will appreciate the added information from the sports programming and other campus-related shows.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really go to bars all that often but I can see how it\u2019s really going to add to the atmosphere,\u201d Manning said.\n\nStudents who aren\u2019t yet 21 don\u2019t have to worry about not missing an opportunity to test out their sports journalism skills: The restaurant is all-ages, although one must be of age to sit at the bar.\n\nThe owners are hoping that the broadcast productions - which will eventually include local TV, radio and newspaper personalities - will help attract a big, diverse crowd.\n\n\u201cA Division I school deserves a Division I sports bar,\u201d Tehven said, noting Herd & Horns will be a mellower place to watch games than some of the other bars closest to campus.\n\nAs sports bars go, the interior of the 4,000-square-foot establishment doesn\u2019t resemble the usual museum atmosphere with framed jerseys, neon signs and other memorabilia. The owners preferred a clean look provided by corrugated metal, reclaimed wood and brick walls. Tehven jokes that one of the owners, former NDSU All-American punter Mike Dragosavich, who came up with the idea of serving beer at the bar out of a Bison horn, has a jersey hanging in another sports bar in town and they don\u2019t want to ask for it back.\n\nThere are, however, two lighted signs in the corner that will show the same message at broadcast time: On Air.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With North Dakota State enjoying a stretch of four straight national football titles since it moved up to Division I athletics, a group of NDSU athlete alumni decided it was time for Bison Nation to have a new sports bar.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With North Dakota State enjoying a stretch of four straight national football titles since it moved up to Division I athletics, a group of NDSU athlete alumni decided it was time for Bison Nation to have a new sports bar.", "title": "New NDSU sports bar doubles as school television studio", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/4/new-ndsu-sports-bar-doubles-as-school-television-s/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/04/7cee60af6e4ac82c830f6a70670022fd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/04/7cee60af6e4ac82c830f6a70670022fd.jpg", "description": "With North Dakota State enjoying a stretch of four straight national football titles since it moved up to Division I athletics, a group of NDSU athlete alumni decided it was time for Bison Nation to h", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "New NDSU sports bar doubles as school television studio"}, "Author": "DAVE KOLPACK", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd25da\"", "article_summary": "\u201cA Division I school deserves a Division I sports bar,\u201d Tehven said, noting Herd & Horns will be a mellower place to watch games than some of the other bars closest to campus.\nRich Lodewyk, broadcast program director for the Bison Information Network, the school\u2019s TV studio, said the arrangement should benefit both his students and the customers.\nNDSU senior Nate Manning, the director of the school\u2019s TV network, said he expects die-hard fans will appreciate the added information from the sports programming and other campus-related shows.\nThe set is cleverly disguised as a long high-top table and chairs in the front corner of the bar.\nA portable TV studio of sorts will serve as a real-world laboratory for the school\u2019s broadcast journalism students to learn how to do live sports talk shows and conduct interviews with players and coaches."}
