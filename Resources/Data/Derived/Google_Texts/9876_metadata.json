For some, the cancellation killed Olympic hopes.\n\nThe Grand Prix\u2019s delegates from the International Ski Federation, which governs skiing and snowboarding, decided Saturday afternoon to not elevate qualifying results from snowboard halfpipe and slopestyle contests as final results. For athletes with Olympic spots on the line, the lack of a result ended their quest for Sochi.\n\n\u201cAll I needed was a top 10,\u201d said Kjersti Buass, the Norwegian snowboarder who qualified third in Thursday\u2019s slopestyle contest. With only eight women in the finals, she had her result to make Norway\u2019s slopestyle team.\n\nBuass joined several other snowboard slopestyle women in an emotional lobbying of the FIS jury Saturday. All eight of the women\u2019s finalists voiced support for making qualifying results final.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it. Especially now when such important things are at stake. We are all here. We are unanimous. Please reconsider this decision,\u201d said Buass, who spent the early season recovering from a shoulder injury and counted the Breckenridge Grand Prix \u2014 a World Cup event \u2014 as her last opportunity to make her fourth Olympics.\n\n\u201cI finally put down a good run and I was really stoked and all these emotions just let go and now suddenly someone is coming in and deciding it won\u2019t count.\u201d\n\nJamie Anderson, the perennial slopestyle champion, qualified first on Thursday with her A-game run. She learned to go hard in every run \u2014 preliminaries or finals \u2014 at last year\u2019s U.S. Open, when snow cancelled the final event and the qualifying order became podium positions.\n\n\u201cI was in second and I did a mellow run,\u201d for her final qualifying run, she said. \u201cI learned that day to always go for it. Always work hard when you can because this happens a lot. I worked really hard here to get that top qualifying because I had a feeling this was all going to go down.\u201d\n\nU.S. Snowboarding may add a third finals event at next week\u2019s final two Olympic qualifying contests at California\u2019s Mammoth Mountain.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like seeing guys who stepped up and landed runs and got into finals and then all the sudden the guys who didn\u2019t are getting a get out of jail free card,\u201d said Ben Boyd, the snowboard director for the Vail Ski and Snowboard Club, which counts several Olympic hopefuls as members. Boyd suggested running just a finals event with Breckenridge Grand Prix qualifiers at Mammoth.\n\nFIS technical delegate Jim Sidorchuk said ski and snowboarding have different rulebooks and that\u2019s why Wednesday\u2019s men\u2019s and women\u2019s ski slopestyle qualifying results were made final when the finals contests was cancelled Friday.\n\nBoth men\u2019s and women\u2019s halfpipe and slopestyle snowboarders were discussing appeals late Saturday. Teams and athletes have 48 hours to file an appeal and the FIS appeals board has 72 hours to issue a decision.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing everything I can to expedite the process,\u201d said FIS event director Bill Van Gilder.\n\nBut he is not reconsidering the decision.\n\n\u201cAlthough it won\u2019t appease all the parties involved, I think the process was fair and just,\u201d Van Gilder said when he announced the decision.\n\nEvent organizers were tentatively planning to move forward with ski halfpipe finals on Sunday, but another weather front was forecast to move into Breckenridge late Saturday, bringing more snow and gusting wind.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Winds cancel Grand Prix events, FIS decision riles snowboarders", "title": "Winds cancel Grand Prix events, FIS decision riles snowboarders", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/11/winds-cancel-grand-prix-events-fis-decision-riles-snowboarders/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140111_025835_kjersti-buaas.jpg", "height": 419}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140111_025835_kjersti-buaas.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-11T15:00:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T03:16:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ee2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI was in second and I did a mellow run,\u201d for her final qualifying run, she said.\nBuass joined several other snowboard slopestyle women in an emotional lobbying of the FIS jury Saturday.\nAll eight of the women\u2019s finalists voiced support for making qualifying results final.\nBoyd suggested running just a finals event with Breckenridge Grand Prix qualifiers at Mammoth.\nBRECKENRIDGE \u2014 The high winds and blowing snow that buffeted Breckenridge\u2019s Grand Prix slopestyle course and halfpipe did more than cancel contests."}
