Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nFor years investors have largely depended on three sources to distill the relentless onslaught of information about public companies: the companies themselves, Wall Street analysts and the media.\n\nEach of these has their strengths, but they may have even bigger weaknesses. Companies spin. Analysts have conflicts of interest. The financial media is under deadline pressure and ill-equipped to act as a catch-all watchdog.\n\nBut in recent years, the tech whizzes out of Silicon Valley have been trying to democratize the markets. In 2010 I wrote about an effort called Moxy Vote, an online system for shareholders to cast ballots in proxy contests. Moxy Vote had some initial success but ran into regulatory trouble and failed to gain traction.\n\nSome newer efforts are more promising, mostly because they depend on users, or some form of crowdsourcing, for their content. Crowdsourcing is when a need is turned over to a large group, usually an online community, rather than traditional paid employees or outside providers.\n\nSo far, crowdsourcing investment opinions on stocks has been a mixed bag for investors. Studies show crowdsourcing can be effective depending on the venue, but the venue question is a hurdle for investors too. SeekingAlpha.com scored high in a study earlier this year by beating Wall Street analysts at predicting earnings , but its not a pure crowd-sourced site. It is edited and some contributors are paid.\n\nIt\u2019s also an exception. Some sites such as Piqqem, a site founded in 2008 that allowed investors to vote their sentiment on expected earnings and stock prices, is defunct.\n\nDuring the last year, however, new services have launched that move the Wall Street crowdsourcing effort in new directions.\n\nEstimize.com is one. It was founded in 2011 by former trader Leigh Drogan, but recently has undergone some significant expansion, adding a crowd-sourced prediction for mergers and acquisitions. Estimize also boasts a track record. It claims it beats Wall Street analysts 65.9% of the time during earnings season. Like SeekingAlpha, Estimize does, however, lean heavily on pros or semi-pros. Nearly 5,000 of its contributors are analysts.\n\nCloser to the social networking world there\u2019s scutify.com, a website and mobile app that aggregates what\u2019s being said about individual stocks on social networks, blogs and other sources. It highlights trending stocks and links to chatter on social networks. (The site is owned by Cody Willard, a contributor to MarketWatch, which is owned by Dow Jones, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal.)\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing startup is TwoMargins.com. The site allows investors, analysts, average Joes \u2014 anyone, really \u2014 to annotate company releases. In that way, Two Margins potentially can tap the power of the crowd to provide a fourth source for the marketplace.\n\nTwo Margins, a startup funded by Bloomberg L.P.\u2019s venture capital fund, borrows annotation technology that\u2019s already in use on other sites such as genius.com and scrible.com. Participants can sign in with their Twitter or Facebook accounts and post to those networks from the site. (Dow Jones competes with Bloomberg in the provision of news and financial data.)\n\nAt this moment, Two Margins isn\u2019t a game changer. Founders Gniewko Lubecki and Akash Kapur said the site is in a pre-beta phase, which is to say it\u2019s sort of up and running and being constantly tweaked.\n\nRight now there\u2019s nothing close to the critical mass needed for an exhaustive look at company filings. There\u2019s just a handful of users and less than a dozen company releases and filings available.\n\nStill, in the first moments after Twitter Inc.\u2019s earnings were released Tuesday, Two Margins\u2019 most loyal users began to scour the release. \u201cLooks like Twitter is getting significantly better at monetizing users,\u201d wrote a user named \u201cGeorge\u201d who had annotated the revenue line from the company\u2019s financial statement. Another user, \u201cScott Paster,\u201d noted Twitter\u2019s stock option grants to executives were nearly as high as its reported loss.\n\n\u201cThe sum is greater than it\u2019s parts when you pull together a community of users,\u201d Mr. Kapur said. \u201cWidening access to these documents is one goal. The other goal is broadening the pool of knowledge that\u2019s brought to bear on these documents.\u201d\n\nIn the end, this new wave of tech-driven services may never capture enough users to make it into the investing mainstream. They all struggle with uninformed and inaccurate content especially if they gain critical mass. Vetting is a problem.\n\nFor that reasons, it\u2019s hard to predict whether these new entries will flourish or even survive. That\u2019s not a bad thing. The march of technology will either improve on the idea or come up with a new one.\n\nUltimately, technology is making possible what hasn\u2019t been. That is, free discussion, access and analysis of information. Some may see it as a threat to Wall Street, which has always charged for expert analysis. Really, though, these efforts are good for markets, which pride themselves on being fair and transparent.\n\nIt\u2019s not just companies that should compete, but ideas too.\n\nUPDATE: An earlier version of this post incorrectly referred to Estimize as Estimate in one instance.
