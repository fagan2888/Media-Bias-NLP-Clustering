Congress is exempt from various occupational health and safety laws, employment discrimination rules and the like. Some of this makes sense. It would hardly be fair, after all, to cite a Republican lawmaker for refusing to hire Democratic staffers. And it should be noted that lawmakers face restrictions on outside income and a loss of privacy most of us don\u2019t endure in our own jobs. How many of us, for example, are required to make public our personal finances, including our investments, debts and personal retirement savings?\n\nStill, the special treatment (whether it\u2019s harsher or more lax) Congress experiences tends to go toward matters that are, well, special to Congress. We demand more disclosure of lawmakers\u2019 personal finances because we want to be assured they do not have vested financial conflicts of interest when making policy that affects the rest of us. We don\u2019t expect them to adhere to certain workplace laws because Congress and the Capitol are not normal workplaces. But then it comes to health care, Congress is giving itself a special treatment unwarranted by the peculiar nature of the institution.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nWhen the Affordable Care Act was being written, annoyed Republicans who opposed the law inserted language presumably meant to appeal to voters and to punish Democrats who wanted the bill: They made special rules for Congress and its employees. The public relations spin on the language is that it forced Congress to live under \u201cObamacare\u201d by requiring congressional employees to get insurance through the health care exchanges. This is a misnomer; Obamacare is not an HMO. It\u2019s a sweeping law requiring everyone to have insurance so the insured won\u2019t be paying for the uninsured, and it allows for federal subsidies for people who can\u2019t afford it.\n\nSignificantly, the law requires businesses that employ 50 or more people to provide coverage for their workers. Lawmakers and staff had already been receiving health coverage through their employer (the U.S. government), and were not going to ever be \u201cexempt\u201d from Obamacare, since everyone is subject to the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s just not that impactful on someone already getting employer-subsidized insurance.\n\nCongress clearly comes under the 50-or-more category, but the special language \u2013 far from imposing a burden on Congress \u2013 in fact relieves the institution of the burden of providing coverage for the staff. The problem for congressional Republicans is that they forgot a small detail: They never changed the law that says Congress and its staff get a federal contribution for their health care. So all the allegedly punishing language did was add another layer of bureaucracy to the process.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Congress]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Congress Should Just Follow Obamacare Like Everyone Else", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "A goofy plan by Republicans only made it more complicated for employees of Congress to get insurance.", "title": "We All Live Under Obamacare", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/susan-milligan/2015/03/16/congress-should-just-follow-obamacare-like-everyone-else", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/a4/c2/ab1662124a528a3136f5bef864b1/150217-healthcaregov-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A goofy plan by Republicans only made it more complicated for employees of Congress to get insurance.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Congress Should Just Follow Obamacare Like Everyone Else"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "March 16, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Susan Milligan,TJS,Congress,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,Republican Party,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion],Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "A goofy plan by Republicans only made it more complicated for employees of Congress to get insurance."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6a00\"", "article_summary": "Still, the special treatment (whether it\u2019s harsher or more lax) Congress experiences tends to go toward matters that are, well, special to Congress.\nBut then it comes to health care, Congress is giving itself a special treatment unwarranted by the peculiar nature of the institution.\nMost Americans would probably agree that Congress is not above the law, though in fact, Congress puts itself above \u2013 or outside \u2013 the law all the time.\nThe public relations spin on the language is that it forced Congress to live under \u201cObamacare\u201d by requiring congressional employees to get insurance through the health care exchanges.\nCongress clearly comes under the 50-or-more category, but the special language \u2013 far from imposing a burden on Congress \u2013 in fact relieves the institution of the burden of providing coverage for the staff."}
