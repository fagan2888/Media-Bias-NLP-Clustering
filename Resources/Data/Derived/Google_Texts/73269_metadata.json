The company is known in Philadelphia for transforming older spaces into office, hotel, restaurant, retail and entertainment space.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nA clearance sale will run into early September.\n\nThe Fifth Avenue building opened as Kaufmann\u2019s in 1887. Cincinnati, Ohio-based Macy\u2019s acquired Kaufmann\u2019s parent company in 2005.\n\nCore pledged to preserve icons of the store\u2019s retailing history, including the outdoor Kaufmann\u2019s clock, Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald said.\n\nThe current version of the clock was installed at Fifth Avenue and Smithfield Street in 1913 and has been a popular meeting place, with generations of Pittsburgh residents telling each other, \u201cMeet me under Kaufmann\u2019s clock.\u201d\n\nMacy\u2019s said it decided to sell because it was using only one-third of the building\u2019s 1.2 million square feet of space, leaving upper floors idle. Chief stores officer Jeff Kantor said the company started exploring uses for the unused property four years ago.\n\nMacy\u2019s started working with Core Realty last year and recently decided to give up the whole building so the developer\u2019s plans could evolve \u201cinto a more holistic project,\u201d Kantor said.\n\n\u201cWe believe this will be an outstanding addition to the downtown Pittsburgh community in an important location in the heart of the city,\u201d Kantor said.\n\nMacy\u2019s said laid-off employees will be offered severance packages. Some employees may be offered positions in nearby stores.\n\nAbout 30 district office employees will move to another Pittsburgh-area Macy\u2019s.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Macy's is closing its historic downtown Pittsburgh location, it said Monday.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Macy's is closing its historic downtown Pittsburgh location, it said Monday.", "title": "Macy's Selling, Closing Landmark Store in Pittsburgh - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3435, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/ap_donald-trump_ap-photo14.jpg", "height": 2920}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/07/13/macys-selling-closing-landmark-store-in-pittsburgh/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Macy's is closing its historic downtown Pittsburgh location, it said Monday.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/ap_donald-trump_ap-photo14.jpg", "title": "Macy's Selling, Closing Landmark Store in Pittsburgh - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Allegheny County, Kaufmann's, Macy's, Pittsburgh,Big Government,macy's", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Pittsburgh", "published_time": "2015-07-13T18:52:29-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Core Realty, a Philadelphia-based developer, bought the 13-story Pittsburgh building and is planning a hotel and residential project, Macy\u2019s said.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 Macy\u2019s is closing its downtown location after selling the landmark building where the now-defunct Kaufmann\u2019s chain ran its flagship store for more than a century, it said Monday.\nChief stores officer Jeff Kantor said the company started exploring uses for the unused property four years ago.\nCincinnati, Ohio-based Macy\u2019s acquired Kaufmann\u2019s parent company in 2005.\nMacy\u2019s started working with Core Realty last year and recently decided to give up the whole building so the developer\u2019s plans could evolve \u201cinto a more holistic project,\u201d Kantor said."}
