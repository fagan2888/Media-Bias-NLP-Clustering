It also asks that states be refunded for what they've already paid.\n\nThe federal government has determined states must pay a portion of the fee to their Medicaid managed care organizations to then pay to the federal government. States get some reimbursement from the federal government for that money, but they end up losing 54 cents for every dollar of the insurance tax.\n\nThe suit says the fee is projected to allow the federal government to collect between $13 billion and $15 billion from states over the next decade.\n\nThe lawsuit does not affect individuals who are enrolled for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act or employers who are required to provide health insurance coverage to employees under the ACA.", "article_metadata": {"description": "States say the federally-imposed fee\u2014which cost Indiana $17.4 million in 2014\u2014violates a constitutional ban on intergovernmental taxes.", "csrf-token": "DqVm11paJeop+kytkwn+u9qq5XLCrwyj/StOL4cuQtE=", "twitter": {"description": "States say the federally-imposed fee\u2014which cost Indiana $17.4 million in 2014\u2014violates a constitutional ban on intergovernmental taxes.", "card": "summary", "title": "Indiana joins suit challenging Obamacare fee"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"image": "http://www.ibj.com/ext/resources/aa-stock-images/og-logo.jpg", "type": "Article", "description": "States say the federally-imposed fee\u2014which cost Indiana $17.4 million in 2014\u2014violates a constitutional ban on intergovernmental taxes.", "title": "Indiana joins suit challenging Obamacare fee"}, "keywords": "insurance,lawsuit,health care,Greg Zoeller,Obamacare", "google-site-verification": "dEpdCgWEqtwBQ26es3xvj1hiJAdg_f1dGEb3ojELomo", "verify-v1": "g4IS1SbAtb6k021/9HzhkZ2B++kYDaZ8FN48PiruaO8=", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd21a9\"", "article_summary": "The lawsuit does not affect individuals who are enrolled for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act or employers who are required to provide health insurance coverage to employees under the ACA.\nThe complaint that Texas, Wisconsin, Kansas, Louisiana, Indiana and Nebraska filed in the Northern District of Texas takes issue with the Health Insurance Providers Fee assessed to health insurers to cover federal subsidies.\nThe suit seeks an injunction against the federal rules that say states are responsible for the fee.\nThe suit says the fee is projected to allow the federal government to collect between $13 billion and $15 billion from states over the next decade.\nThe federal government has determined states must pay a portion of the fee to their Medicaid managed care organizations to then pay to the federal government."}
