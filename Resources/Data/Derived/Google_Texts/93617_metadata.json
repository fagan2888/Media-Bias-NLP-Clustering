Grace Meng (D-N.Y.), wrote in a farewell note this week to colleagues and friends.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMoskowitz started his Capitol career in 1983 as a staffer for then-Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.).\n\n\u201cI arrived in the House in a time of Selectric typewriters, carbon sets, mandatory House Bean Soup served each day in the cafeterias, a pile of Dear Colleague letters in four daily mail deliveries, and the placement each morning of a bucket of ice at every House office,\u201d the longtime congressional worker wrote.\n\n\u201cI leave with iPhones, eNewsletters, ubiquitous Starbucks, and even more digital Dear Colleagues.\u201d\n\nWhile Moskowitz, 63, quips that he misses the ice, (which was stopped in 1996 by former Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who later claimed he saved taxpayers half a million dollars each year by ending the daily deliveries) he tells ITK the cubes aren\u2019t the only things that have melted away in Washington.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows the story about how it\u2019s not as friendly, and I think that\u2019s true for the members, especially,\u201d the New York City native says. But many staffers have \u201cmore of an expansive view,\u201d he adds, explaining, \u201cThere are lots of opportunities for staff to get together, and I do have lots of friends who are on the other side of the aisle.\u201d\n\nMoskowitz, who retires on Thursday, says he\u2019ll miss the routine he\u2019s built up after decades of arriving for work at the Capitol. But he\u2019s looking forward to catching up on some good books.\n\n\u201cMost of my reading over the past 32 years in Congress has been originally newspapers, magazines, and of course now the Internet, but it\u2019s all been about the news in Congress. I don\u2019t get to do enough pleasure reading,\u201d he says with a chuckle.\n\n\u201cI have to renew my library card, I think.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Jedd Moskowitz is believed to be the longest-serving active chief of staff.", "description": "Jedd Moskowitz is believed to be the longest-serving active chief of staff.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "In The Know"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Jedd Moskowitz is believed to be the longest-serving active chief of staff.", "title": "Capitol staffer retires after 32 years", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/237756-capitol-staffer-retires-after-32-years", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/moskowitzjedd04022015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/237756-capitol-staffer-retires-after-32-years", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-02T15:11-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Tristan Lejeune", "author": "Judy Kurtz", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-02T15:11:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/in-the-know/237756-capitol-staffer-retires-after-32-years", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Jedd Moskowitz is believed to be the longest-serving active chief of staff.", "card": "summary", "title": "Capitol staffer retires after 32 years"}, "dcterms.title": "Capitol staffer retires after 32 years"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a8d\"", "article_summary": "After 32 years, Jedd Moskowitz has been told he\u2019s the longest currently serving House chief of staff.\nADVERTISEMENTMoskowitz started his Capitol career in 1983 as a staffer for then-Rep.
