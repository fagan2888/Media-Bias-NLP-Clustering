Paul Ryan. The final vote was 266 to 167, with 79 Republicans joining every Democrat in sealing passage. Ryan was among the supporters. The legislation, which raises federal spending levels and expands the government\u2019s borrowing authority, would push two of Congress\u2019s fiercest fiscal fights well beyond next year\u2019s elections, precluding potential standoffs with President Obama and easing Ryan\u2019s transition into the Speaker\u2019s chair. The package drew fierce opposition from conservative Republicans, who denounced both the secret talks that produced it and the policy provisions featured within, particularly the spending hikes and the debt ceiling increase.\n\nNeedless to say, this is all the fault of feckless GOP leaders. If only they had held firm for long enough in pointing a gun at the head of the U.S. economy while demanding unilateral concessions from Democrats, surely Dems would have caved eventually. And now we will never know whether this might have worked (never mind that it has repeatedly failed in the past), so conservatives, conveniently, can continue blaming GOP leaders for this awful outcome. \u2014 gs\n\n* Now it\u2019s over to the Senate:\n\nSenate leaders want to move the bill quickly \u2014 the Treasury Department estimates the deadline for raising the debt ceiling is Nov. 3. Presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul said Tuesday that he plans to filibuster the bill, but his chances of slowing down passage are limited. The agreement will have to clear one procedural hurdle with at least 60 votes before it can be approved by a simple majority. At most Paul could briefly delay the final vote by refusing to allow leaders to cut off debate before the maximum 30 hours allowed under Senate rules have expired. The final Senate vote could come as early as this week.\n\nQuick, send lots of money to Ted Cruz, the only Real Conservative in the Senate with the guts to hold GOP leaders accountable for their craven willingness to enter into bipartisan governing compromises rather than threaten widespread economic damage to get their way! \u2014 gs\n\n* Paul Ryan finally, reluctantly, grudgingly consents to be elevated to a position of great power:\n\nHouse Republicans on Wednesday nominated Rep. Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, long seen as one of the party\u2019s brightest stars, to become their next speaker and standard-bearer. The internal party vote to choose a successor for outgoing Speaker John A. Boehner took place behind closed doors in an afternoon meeting. According to a tally announced inside the room, Ryan won support from 200 of the 247-member GOP conference. A House floor vote to select the new speaker is set for Thursday morning, bringing an end to a five-week scramble to find Boehner\u2019s replacement.\n\nDid you know he was a policy wonk?
