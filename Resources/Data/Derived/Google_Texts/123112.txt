Former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania discusses consolidation in health care and weighs in on whether it's right to have a third of brewers in this country to be owned by one company.

Mergers and acquisitions by energy companies, technology giants like IBM and even hotel chains have recently peppered the news.

Pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance announced Tuesday it would buy Rite Aid for $9 per share in an all-cash deal. And the world's two biggest brewers, Belgium's Anheuser-Busch InBev and South Africa-based brewer SABMiller, have faced a long string of negotiations in a deal that would mean rival brews like Budweiser and Miller Lite would be sold by the same company.

That deal could mean rising beer prices around the world. But Sen. Rick Santorum said he's more concerned about health insurance than about some of the other big industries seeing consolidation â€” like beer.



"In health care, what you're seeing is a lot of consolidation, and that consolidation is happening because of Obamacare," Santorum said. "You're seeing the health insurance companies fold up."

Obamacare's minimum loss ratios "make it impossible for a small insurer to operate effectively," a move that he said makes it easier for liberal candidates to push for single-payer systems to increase competition, Santorum said.
