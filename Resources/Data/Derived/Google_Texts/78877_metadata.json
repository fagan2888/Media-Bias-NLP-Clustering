A Pew Research Center survey last month found only 43 percent of Republicans \u2014 and 25 percent of tea partyers \u2014 accept the theory of evolution. The reason is obvious: Evolution contradicts a literal reading of the Bible. Only 27 percent of white evangelical Protestants, who make up nearly half of the conservative wing of the GOP, think evolution is true. This is a clear case of motivated reasoning \u2014 of letting your feelings determine the facts you accept.\n\nLikewise, two-thirds of Americans think the planet has been getting warmer. But only half of Republicans, and only one in four tea partyers, think that. As to what is causing global warming, two-thirds of Democrats \u2014 but only one-quarter of Republicans \u2014 think human activity has something to do with it.\n\nThere is much confirmation bias going on here, too: The science of climate change is not so settled as the science of evolution, but it is solid. This doesn\u2019t mean no questions remain \u2014 the current pause in global warming has the potential to falsify the anthropogenic thesis. But just because we don\u2019t know everything doesn\u2019t mean we know nothing.\n\nProgressives have gotten a lot of mileage mocking conservatives\u2019 truculent refusal to accept scientific conclusions. But the left has exhibited similar truculence on another subject: genetically modified organisms \u2014 \u201cFrankenfoods,\u201d as they\u2019re sometimes called.\n\nLast month, Hawaii County Mayor Billy Kenoi signed a measure banning GMOs (except genetically modified papaya). The measure enjoyed passionate support from supporters who made many of the standard arguments against GM foods: They cause cancer. And allergies. And liver and immunodeficiency problems. They spread uncontrollably, causing \u201cgenetic pollution\u201d and \u201ccontaminating\u201d the natural ecosystem. And they probably do lots of other horrible things, too, but we don\u2019t know what because they haven\u2019t been studied enough.\n\nAll of which is thoroughly false.\n\nGM foods have been studied, extensively and assiduously. And the overwhelming scientific consensus is that they present no danger. \u201cThe main conclusion to be drawn from the efforts of more than 130 research projects, covering a period of more than 25 years of research, and involving more than 500 independent research groups, is that biotechnology, and in particular GMOs, are no more risky than conventional plant breeding technologies.\u201d That is the conclusion of the European Commission.\n\nIt is seconded by the American Medical Association, which agrees \u201cthere is no scientific justification for special labeling of genetically modified foods.\u201d\n\nAnd by the National Academy of Sciences, which says \u201cno evidence of human health problems associated with the ingestion of (GM) crops or resulting food products have been identified.\u201d\n\nAnd by the French Academy of Science, which says, \u201cAll criticisms against GMOs can be largely rejected on strictly scientific criteria.\u201d\n\nAnd by the Union of German Academies of Sciences and Humanities, which says the risk from GM foods \u201cis in no way higher than in the consumption of food from conventionally grown plants. On the contrary, in some cases, food from GM plants appears to be superior in respect to health.\u201d\n\nRegarding that last point, consider golden rice \u2014 which has been engineered to produce a precursor of vitamin A. It has the potential to prevent more than a million childhood deaths a year in the impoverished world. But GMO opponents continue to attack it, both rhetorically and physically.\n\nIn August, saboteurs wrecked a golden rice field trial in the Philippines. In response, Science magazine printed an editorial by a chairman emeritus of the National Academies of Science \u2014 along with two Nobel laureates, a National Medal of Science laureate and several other eminent scientists.\n\n\u201cIf ever there was a clear-cut case for outrage,\u201d they wrote, \u201cit is the concerted campaign by Greenpeace and other non-governmental organizations \u2026 against golden rice. \u2026 Introduced into commercial production over 17 years ago, GM crops have an exemplary safety record. And precisely because they benefit farmers, the environment, and consumers, GM crops have been adopted faster than any other agricultural advance in the history of humanity. \u2026 We, and the thousands of other scientists who have signed (a) statement of protest, stand together in staunch opposition to the violent destruction of required tests on valuable advances such as golden rice that have the potential to save millions of impoverished fellow humans from needless suffering and death.\u201d\n\nIf the overwhelming scientific consensus on GM foods is so clear, then why do so many environmentalists and other activists resist it? Simple \u2014 they do so for the same reason right-wingers resist the scientific consensus on climate change: fear of Them. To GMO critics, \u201cthey\u201d are not big, bad government but big, bad corporations.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The conspiracy-minded, anti-science liberals.", "title": "Eat Your Frankenfood!", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/01/27/eat-your-frankenfood", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13908333864223.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13908333864223.jpg", "title": "Eat Your Frankenfood!", "description": "A slavish devotion to narrow ideology has led many people to\nreject overwhelming scientific consensus as nothing but a plot by\nmalevolent forces to control ordinary people\u2019s lives.\nIf you think that sentence describes conservative skeptics of\nglobal warming, congratulations \u2014 you\u2019re right.\nIf you think it describes liberal opponents of genetically\nmodified crops, congratulations \u2014 you\u2019re right again.\nConservatives get tagged as anti-science, and for good reason.
