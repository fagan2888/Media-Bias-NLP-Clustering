H. \u2014 The contrast couldn\u2019t be more striking.\n\nNo denunciations of immigrants or vows to build walls. No pledge to rip out Obamacare by the roots (though he\u2019d replace it). No denunciations of the Iranian arms deal or working with Democrats.\n\nIn a year when most Republican rivals have vied to match frontrunner Donald Trump\u2019s often outrageous proposals, highly personalized attacks and establishment bashing, Ohio Gov. John Kasich stands out as a voice of moderation and compromise.\n\n\u201cAnybody can come around and make a promise: we\u2019re going to do this, we\u2019re going to do that, we\u2019re going to have a 10 percent flat tax, we\u2019re going to abolish the IRS,\u201d Kasich told several dozen people who attended his 87th town meeting Monday at an American Legion hall in this eastern New Hampshire town.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo I\u2019m here giving you what I would need to do to govern, not to get elected.\u201d And he asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t think we can solve these problems without both parties, do you?\u201d\n\nBut Florida Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s close third in Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses threatens Kasich\u2019s hope of emerging as the top establishment candidate in next Tuesday\u2019s New Hampshire primary. Kasich, who largely ignored Iowa, was eighth of 11.\n\nHe professes to be unconcerned, telling a Bloomberg Politics Breakfast Briefing Wednesday, \u201cThe media is going to pump this for a couple days and ... then we\u2019re going to see.\u201d\n\nLater, at the governor\u2019s 93rd town meeting in Newmarket, two likely Kasich voters dismissed the Iowa impact here. \u201cHe didn\u2019t make much effort there, so I discount it,\u201d said Bill Healey, 78, a retired computer systems consultant.\n\n\u201cIowa is Iowa,\u201d said his wife, Crescentia Anne Healy, 79. \u201cWe\u2019re so different.\u201d\n\nKasich\u2019s campaign, which stresses his conservative credentials in balancing the federal budget in Congress and governing Ohio the past six years, isn\u2019t totally positive. On Monday, he condemned \u201cnegative crap\u201d in the media advertising of rivals Chris Christie and Jeb Bush. That night, his independent Super PAC, New Day for America, aired a television ad showing Bush encased in mud.\n\nBut his approach enabled the Ohio governor to rise in mid-January to second in the Real Clear Politics average of New Hampshire polls and he leaves many hitherto undecided voters with positive vibes..\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t trash anyone,\u201d said Karen Merrill of Barrington, 59, an Air Force veteran and stay-at-home mother. \u201cHe\u2019s talking policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of angry men,\u201d said John Roese, 73, or Rochester, a retired Air Force officer and aerospace employee.\n\nMost New Hampshire newspapers have endorsed him as have The Boston Globe and The New York Times, which called Kasich \u201cthe only plausible choice for Republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race.\u201d\n\nBut Rubio\u2019s strong Iowa showing has complicated Kasich\u2019s effort to beat the Florida senator, along with Bush and Christie. \u201cThey all have to beat each other to have an opportunity to consolidate mainstream voters and donors,\u201d said Fergus Cullen, a former state GOP chairman who backs Kasich.\n\nHowever, even some past candidates who made unexpectedly strong showings in New Hampshire \u2014 like primary victors Democrat Gary Hart in 1984 and Republican John McCain in 2000 \u2014 failed to sustain their momentum afterwards. And Kasich\u2019s approach bears some resemblance to that four years ago by former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr., who finished third with 17 percent but ran out of money and dropped out a week later.\n\n\u201cWhat we have to do is get to March 15,\u201d said veteran New Hampshire pol Tom Rath. That\u2019s when the primary calendar moves to Kasich\u2019s home state of Ohio and other Midwestern bastions and when winning candidates can win all of a state\u2019s delegates, rather than dividing them proportionally.\n\nBut that not only requires finishing second here, it means doing well in Massachusetts and Vermont and surviving primaries in such conservative strongholds as South Carolina on Feb. 20, and the many Southern states including Texas on March 1.\n\nStill, even before Iowa voted, one veteran Washington analyst, Stuart Rothenberg, wrote in Roll Call that, even if Kasich beats Rubio here, \u201cthe Ohio governor simply has not shown the appeal \u2014 or put together the campaign elsewhere \u2014 that he would need to become a true contender in the Republican race.\n\n\u201cIf I get smoked here,\u201d Kasich said in Newmarket, \u201cI\u2019m going (back) to Ohio.\u201d\n\nHe added he is also \u201cprepared to move forward. But it\u2019s in the hands of the people of New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nCarl P. Leubsdorf is the former Washington bureau chief of The Dallas Morning News.
