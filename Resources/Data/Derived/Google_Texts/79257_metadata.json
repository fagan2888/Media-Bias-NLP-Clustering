Windows cannot be opened, and doors open only when the train fully stops, which takes several minutes.\n\nYet, in a country with strict gun control and low crime rate, security is lax \u2014 no identification or baggage checks required.\n\nOn Tuesday, Haruo Hayashizaki, a 71-year-old retiree, poured a flammable liquid over himself and lit it while riding a bullet train heading to Osaka from Tokyo. He died on the spot, and smoke filled the coach, choking a female passenger to death.\n\nIt was the first fire in the train\u2019s 50-year history. Experts say it was a wake-up call to something more disastrous, potentially a terrorist attack, and it\u2019s time to step up risk management ahead of the G-7 summit in Japan next year and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\u201cThe incident took advantage of the blind spots on the Shinkansen,\u201d said Seiji Abe, an expert on transportation safety at Kansai University in Osaka. \u201cFire caused by malicious intentions was not anticipated, and provisions to keep out hazardous materials were not in place.\u201d\n\nSo far, authorities haven\u2019t found any mishandling by the train operator, but the initial investigation and witness accounts have raised questions, including how quickly crew members grasped the situation and whether there should be a better way to clear smoke from the hermetically sealed cars.\n\nA passenger pushed an emergency button, but unlike some newer models, this train was not equipped with an emergency intercom, said Tomoyuki Sano, a spokesman for Central Japan Railway Co., which operates the Tokyo-Osaka segment of the bullet train.\n\nThat meant that crew members knew something had happened in the area where the button was pressed, but were most likely unaware it was a fire until they arrived at the scene.\n\nIn a standard emergency procedure, the overhead electric power was cut off for a 20-kilometer (12-mile) stretch to keep the tracks clear for police and rescue workers, also shutting off the train\u2019s ventilation system.\n\nSatoru Sone, an expert on railway safety at Kogakuin University in Tokyo, said that the power should never be turned off, because ventilation is crucial to getting smoke out. He also said an emergency button with an intercom should be installed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fatal fire on Japan\u2019s airtight bullet train exposes lapses", "title": "Fatal fire on Japan\u2019s airtight bullet train exposes lapses", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Fatal fire on Japan\u2019s airtight bullet train exposes lapses", "title": "Fatal fire on Japan\u2019s airtight bullet train exposes lapses", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/04/fatal_fire_on_japans_airtight_bullet_train_exposes_lapses/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/japan-bullet-train-safety.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fatal fire on Japan\u2019s airtight bullet train exposes lapses", "title": "Fatal fire on Japan\u2019s airtight bullet train exposes lapses", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/japan-bullet-train-safety.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mari Yamaguchi", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "On Tuesday, Haruo Hayashizaki, a 71-year-old retiree, poured a flammable liquid over himself and lit it while riding a bullet train heading to Osaka from Tokyo.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsTOKYO (AP) \u2014 A fatal fire on Japan\u2019s bullet train, started by a man who self-immolated this week, has revealed blind spots in a system renowned for its speed, punctuality and safety record.\nHe also said an emergency button with an intercom should be installed.\nA passenger pushed an emergency button, but unlike some newer models, this train was not equipped with an emergency intercom, said Tomoyuki Sano, a spokesman for Central Japan Railway Co., which operates the Tokyo-Osaka segment of the bullet train.\nWindows cannot be opened, and doors open only when the train fully stops, which takes several minutes."}
