Much like the current occupant of the White House, Cruz launched his presidential bid after less than half a term in the Senate, and his eagerness has given rise to questions about his \u201cexperience.\u201d Barack Obama faced those same questions, though he took proactive measures to neutralize the issue well in advance of his presidential run. Cruz, however, has chosen a different path \u2013 he\u2019s claiming that he\u2019s a super-experienced Senate leader who\u2019s been leading the fight on blah blah yadda yadda etc.\n\nThat\u2019s nonsense, but Republicans have been arguing for years now that first-term senators make bad presidents, so he has to do what he can to claim the \u201cexperience\u201d mantle and quell the suspicions of the GOP base. And he\u2019s apparently test-driving a few new arguments for why his thin Senate r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is no big hindrance.\n\nBloomberg\u2019s Dave Weigel reported yesterday that Cruz, campaigning in New Hampshire, challenged the argument coming from some Republicans and conservative pundits that the GOP should nominate a governor, and not a senator, because governors have better \u201cexperience.\u201d Chafing again at the implied comparison to Obama, Cruz argued that it\u2019s not Obama\u2019s senatorial experience that makes him bad, but rather his raging socialism:\n\nHere\u2019s what history teaches us. About half of the presidents have been governors; half of them, senators. There have been good and bad presidents who were both. Jimmy Carter was a governor. He was a trainwreck. Obama is not a disaster because he was a senator. Obama is a disaster because he\u2019s an unmitigated socialist, what he believes is profoundly dangerous, and he\u2019s undermined the Constitution and the role of America in the world. I think the test we ought to apply is not what job title a person had. I think the test we ought to have is: Who has stood up and fought?\n\nAgain, Ted Cruz hasn\u2019t really \u201cstood up and fought\u201d so much as he\u2019s stood up and shouted HEY LOOK AT ME I\u2019M STANDING. But the \u201cObama\u2019s a socialist\u201d stuff is interesting because it shows what kind of campaign Cruz is going to run: specifically, a losing one.\n\nTo be clear, Cruz calling Obama an \u201cunmitigated socialist\u201d isn\u2019t exactly an earth-shaking development. When he ran for the Senate in 2012, he called the president an \u201chonest-to-God socialist\u201d and \u201ca clueless, out-of-touch socialist.\u201d (He even tried to paint his opponent in the Republican primary as a quasi-socialist backer of \u201cEuropean-style\u201d healthcare programs.) He wasn\u2019t making a coherent argument against the policies of the incumbent administration \u2013 he was just tickling the rage centers of the conservative brain. And he probably figures that since it worked in Texas, it\u2019ll probably work pretty well in the Republican primary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Desperate new argument only proves it: The Red Menace is alive and well, he says -- but Medicare doesn't count", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s demented \u201csocialist\u201d snipes: Here\u2019s how you know he\u2019s running a losing campaign", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Desperate new argument only proves it: The Red Menace is alive and well, he says -- but Medicare doesn't count", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s demented \u201csocialist\u201d snipes: Here\u2019s how you know he\u2019s running a losing campaign", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/22/ted_cruzs_demented_socialist_snipes_heres_how_you_know_hes_running_a_losing_campaign/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/ted_cruz18.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Desperate new argument only proves it: The Red Menace is alive and well, he says -- but Medicare doesn't count", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s demented \u201csocialist\u201d snipes: Here\u2019s how you know he\u2019s running a losing campaign", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/ted_cruz18.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama, GOP, Medicare, Obamacare, Republican Primary, Ronald Reagan, Socialism, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And he probably figures that since it worked in Texas, it\u2019ll probably work pretty well in the Republican primary.\nAgain, Ted Cruz hasn\u2019t really \u201cstood up and fought\u201d so much as he\u2019s stood up and shouted HEY LOOK AT ME I\u2019M STANDING.\nCruz, however, has chosen a different path \u2013 he\u2019s claiming that he\u2019s a super-experienced Senate leader who\u2019s been leading the fight on blah blah yadda yadda etc.\nBut the \u201cObama\u2019s a socialist\u201d stuff is interesting because it shows what kind of campaign Cruz is going to run: specifically, a losing one.\nAnd he\u2019s apparently test-driving a few new arguments for why his thin Senate r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is no big hindrance."}
