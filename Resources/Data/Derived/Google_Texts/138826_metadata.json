The Avalanche can be really good when the challenge is great and the odds are stacked on the other side.\n\nFollowing Saturday night\u2019s 6-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens \u2014 making Colorado 3-0 on its seven-game road trip \u2014 the Avs have now handily defeated the NHL\u2019s two conference leaders.\n\nPatrick Roy\u2019s puzzle is piecing itself together, and undoubtedly looking like a team on the rise.\n\nThe Canadiens entered the Bell Centre 13-2-2 \u2014 7-0-1 at home \u2014 on Saturday with a league-high 28 points. The Avs pounded Western Conference-leader Dallas 6-3 on Oct. 10 in Denver.\n\nThanks to goalie Reto Berra, timely scoring and a solid penalty kill, the Avs have become a poised and confident bunch playing without No. 1 goalie Semyon Varlamov (injured) and captain Gabe Landeskog, who served the first game of his two-game suspension in Montreal after missing the last half of Thursday\u2019s 3-2 win at Boston because of a match penalty.\n\nLeft-winger Mikhail Grigorenko, who replaced Landeskog on the Avs\u2019 top line, was excellent. The 21-year-old had the game-opening goal and assisted on center Nathan MacKinnon\u2019s two goals within 13 seconds to give Colorado a 3-0 lead after the first period.\n\nMatt Duchene, the right-winger on that line, also had three points \u2014 including a power-play goal \u2014 and John Mitchell also scored late in the third period.\n\nAfter the Habs got within 3-1 in the second, Blake Comeau produced his first goal of the season during the Avs\u2019 penalty kill to turn the sellout crowd into hushed spectators.\n\nMacKinnon\u2019s two goals came at 18:25 and 18:38 of the first period, coming close to Jon Klemm\u2019s franchise record of two goals within nine seconds in 1997. MacKinnon\u2019s first came off a faceoff, when he collected a loose puck, turned and fired inside the far post (glove-side). His line remained on the ice and took the center-ice draw. On the rush at high speed, MacKinnon drove the net and redirected a Grigorenko feed. Duchene collected his second assist and Colorado was in charge 3-0 after 20 minutes.\n\nMontreal took advantage of two mistakes to get within 3-1. Fourth-line center Ben Street caused an icing when he was feet away from the center line and dumping the puck cleanly. On the ensuing faceoff in front of Berra, Street and two defensemen didn\u2019t body-up or box out Brendan Gallagher, and the Habs forward knocked in the bouncing puck high over Berra\u2019s shoulder. Otherwise Berra stopped the other 39 shots he faced to improve to 4-3 on the season.\n\nDuring Montreal\u2019s ensuing power play, Comeau gathered the puck and drove in on a 2-on-1 short-handed rush. He faked the pass and his slap shoot zipped behind Condon.\n\nThe Avs move on to Toronto, where they play the Maple Leafs on Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche pounds NHL points leader Montreal, improves to 3-0 on trip", "title": "Avalanche pounds NHL points leader Montreal, improves to 3-0 on trip", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/14/avalanche-pounds-nhl-points-leader-montreal-improves-to-3-0-on-trip/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151114__20151115_CC4_SP15HKNAVSCUTp1.jpg", "height": 415}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151114__20151115_CC4_SP15HKNAVSCUTp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-14T19:50:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T08:09:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Following Saturday night\u2019s 6-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens \u2014 making Colorado 3-0 on its seven-game road trip \u2014 the Avs have now handily defeated the NHL\u2019s two conference leaders.\nFourth-line center Ben Street caused an icing when he was feet away from the center line and dumping the puck cleanly.\nThe Avalanche can be really good when the challenge is great and the odds are stacked on the other side.\nMacKinnon\u2019s first came off a faceoff, when he collected a loose puck, turned and fired inside the far post (glove-side).\nThe Canadiens entered the Bell Centre 13-2-2 \u2014 7-0-1 at home \u2014 on Saturday with a league-high 28 points."}
