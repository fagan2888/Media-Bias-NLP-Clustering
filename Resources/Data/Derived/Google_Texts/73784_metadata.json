Manzi\u2019s son, 15-year-old Keenan Manzi, who attends Monadnock Regional, is in the gym training for bouts five days a week. Colleen, Chris\u2019 wife and Keenan\u2019s mother, also trains at Contenders.\n\n\u201cWe started at a very small location in Swanzey,\u201d Chris recalled. \u201cWe\u2019ve already doubled that space with this location and we just want to keep growing.\u201d\n\nKeenan will compete in the Silver Mittens competition in Lowell, Mass., on March 31. If Keenan wins a semifinal match, he will be invited back for the finals.\n\n\u201cI think boxing builds good character,\u201d Chris said. \u201cTwo years ago, (Keenan) asked if we could come try it. If he didn\u2019t like it, we would\u2019ve turned around and walked away.\u201d\n\nKeenan took a liking to the physical sport, the dedication it needs to compete and the strenuous workouts that go with the training routine.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a very tight-knit family,\u201d Durling said of the Manzis. \u201cIt\u2019s a good healthy environment. They have a lot of energy.\u201d\n\nJen Amato, a 4-foot-6, 106-pound grad school student, fell in love with the sport two years ago. Amato, the longtime girlfriend of Durling, also trains at Contenders.\n\nAmato said sometimes her life feels like a balancing act: a 3-year-old at home, grad school classes while working toward a doctorate in psychology and training two times a day, six nights a week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a grind,\u201d Amato said with a smile, while she wiped sweat from her forehead after the type of strenuous workouts you wouldn\u2019t want to put your worst enemy through. \u201cThe workouts are pure torture.\u201d\n\nBut those long workouts make it easier for Amato when she\u2019s in the ring.\n\n\u201cI know when we fight people, there\u2019s no way my opponent has done what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Amato said.\n\nRecently, Amato\u2019s hard work paid off at Webster Hall in New York City against three-time Junior Olympic champion Julie LaDisa. Amato won in a three-round unanimous decision.\n\n\u201cShe was from the Bronx, so we had three people there, she had the whole city there,\u201d Amato said. \u201cThey were throwing stuff at us after we won. But it was a big night, a huge crowd.\u201d\n\nNow, the focus shifts to nationals for Amato, who is 7-1 with two knockouts for her career. The national competition will be held in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in July.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m wicked excited,\u201d Amato said. \u201cIt\u2019s my first time at the national level. That was my ultimate goal to make it to nationals so I could test my ability against the best girls.\u201d\n\nDurling added, \u201cJen has a great work ethic. She\u2019s very dedicated and she\u2019s always willing to put herself out there.\u201d\n\nBrittnie Stockton also claimed a win on Friday night, fighting in Billerica, Mass., against Jillian Diauto.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reflection on her training,\u201d Durling said. \u201cIt was a close fight but she showed a lot of heart and worked real hard. She just outworked the other girl.\u201d\n\nFor Durling, it\u2019s been a long journey watching his gym grow to what it is now.\n\n\u201cA long, long time ago, in a barn on Water Street,\u201d Durling said as if he was getting ready to start a fairy tale. \u201cI decided with a couple of friends to start a wrestling clinic. It went on for two years with not much technique. But eventually, I started to search for those techniques.\u201d\n\nDurling spent time in Claremont and Massachusetts, learning from the experts about mixed martial arts and jijitsu and combining that with the knowledge he had already accumulated from wrestling in high school and coaching at Keene Middle School for eight years.\n\nThus, Contenders Gym was born.\n\nDurling, who has claimed two extreme combat amateur titles and a 2011 Golden Gloves title, now is focusing on running the gym. But he hasn\u2019t ruled out possibly getting back into the ring.\n\n\u201cWe were moving into this location and things were taking off. I wanted to focus on the move and coaching,\u201d Durling said.\n\nA girls\u2019 class, run by Jenn Durling and Amanda Adams, has added variety to the area\u2019s only boxing gym.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to bring something unique to this area,\u201d Matt said with a smile. \u201cI wanted to wrestle, now I\u2019m putting out boxers. I just saw a good opportunity and I took it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a fun journey to watch this all come together with all the connections we\u2019ve made and people we\u2019ve met. I knew the only way I could do this was to make it happen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "SentinelSource.com", "description": "A black and yellow sign, hanging at the end in a light at the end of the tunnel type of way in a warehouse a few blocks removed from the hustle and bustle of downtown Keene, reads \u201cContenders Gym.\u201d", "title": "Small area boxing gym has big-time dreams", "url": "http://www.sentinelsource.com/sports/local_sports/small-area-boxing-gym-has-big-time-dreams/article_3eefef78-fa9e-5e61-8dc7-1e17c63ecbf1.html", "image": "http://sentinelsource.com/app/SSlogo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@sentinelsource", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 195134749461}, "keywords": "local_sports,top_story", "google-site-verification": "oOCA50_TAAjdvXwxVnDnOs5yS_kZUqHI6u4prlFHnH4", "news_keywords": "local_sports,top_story", "description": "A black and yellow sign, hanging at the end in a light at the end of the tunnel type of way in a warehouse a few blocks removed from the hustle and bustle of downtown Keene, reads \u201cContenders Gym.\u201d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34b5\"", "article_summary": "Manzi\u2019s son, 15-year-old Keenan Manzi, who attends Monadnock Regional, is in the gym training for bouts five days a week.\n\u201cA long, long time ago, in a barn on Water Street,\u201d Durling said as if he was getting ready to start a fairy tale.\n\u201cThe workouts are pure torture.\u201dBut those long workouts make it easier for Amato when she\u2019s in the ring.\nA girls\u2019 class, run by Jenn Durling and Amanda Adams, has added variety to the area\u2019s only boxing gym.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a reflection on her training,\u201d Durling said."}
