Clinton was in the middle of criticizing Trump over his proposed tax plan, which she argued was \"written by billionaires, for billionaires.\"\n\n\"Here is what Donald Trump wants to do,\" Clinton said. \"He has released just one detailed proposal in this whole campaign.\n\n\"What about his tax returns,\" shouted a man in the audience.\n\n\"Well, we are going to get to that,\" Clinton responded.\n\nAfter further criticizing Trump's proposal, Clinton shifted back to Trump's tax returns.\n\n\"And what about his taxes?\" she asked.\n\n\"When you run for president, especially when you become the nominee, that is kind of expected,\" Clinton continued.\n\n\"My husband and I have released 33 years of tax returns. We've got eight years on our website right now,\" she said. \"So you've got to ask yourself, why doesn't he want to release them?\"\n\nClinton added: \"Yeah, we're going to find out.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump told the Associated Press he will release them after the audit is complete and that he won't instruct his lawyers to do so sooner, even if it isn't finished by November.\n\n\"There's nothing to learn from them,\" the real estate mogul told the AP.\n\nTrump also said he doesn't believe the American public is interested in his returns.\n\nHe later sought to clarify the remarks via Twitter on Wednesday:\n\nIn interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete, not after election! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 11, 2016\n\nClinton made her first public campaign appearance in New Jersey on Wednesday since she launched her nationwide bid. Eager to put the primaries behind her, she told supporters voters will have a clear choice to make when they head to the polls in November.\n\nMore than 1,000 enthusiastic supporters welcomed the former secretary of state to Camden County.\n\nFollowing the event, Clinton visited Cooper Hospital in the heart of Camden, where she greeted about 40 employees \u2014 mostly nurses \u2014 and thanked them for their work. Clinton prodded them during an 18-minute informal question-and-answer session to talk about their concerns in the health care field and discuss the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAmong the hospital administrators who welcomed the Democratic White House hopeful to Cooper was Kevin O'Dowd, Republican Gov. Chris Christie's former chief of staff who assumed a leadership role at the hospital in 2014.\n\nBut before Clinton can get to battling Trump in the General Election, she needs to lock away the Democratic nomination. New Jersey holds its primary June 7.\n\nHer Democratic rival, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, held a pair of rallies on Sunday and Monday in New Brunswick and Atlantic City. Clinton clinched enough delegates to make it mathematically impossible for the Vermont senator to secure enough delegates in the remaining primary contests.\n\nBut Sanders' aides have suggested the his path to the nomination is in securing superdelegates.\n\nNJ Advance Media staff writer Brent Johnson contributed to this report.\n\nMatt Arco may be reached at marco@njadvancemedia.com.
