It's two-dimensional,\" said Dan Zielinski, director of the Jenks Public Schools planetarium.\n\n\"With the dome as a globe, it shows geography and spatial distances.\n\nA person realizes distances are farther. Since using the dome with the World War II study, students say, 'Wow, from California to Japan is a long way.' It's on a sphere now, and we don't have to cut it or translate it in our heads.\"\n\nThe on-campus planetarium is perhaps one of the Tulsa area's most fascinating secrets.\n\nSome people have heard of the district's planetarium. But they don't know much more than that.\n\n\"We knew early on not to completely throw our name out there because we needed to build up a library of shows,\" Zielinski said. \"We didn't want to bring people in and keep showing the same show.\"\n\nThat will be changing now.\n\nA healthy movie selection is available, and the public is finding this gem.\n\nThe planetarium is not just for entertainment purposes, although it seems that way.\n\n\"We are using our planetarium as an education tool,\" Zielinski said. \"Most people think a planetarium is a place to come in, learn stuff and leave. But our unique placement on a big high school has provided access to a variety of experiences.\"\n\nStudent productions: Planetariums are rooted in science, but the Jenks facility is sprouting different branches.\n\nThe facility is part of the $22 million, 80,000-square-foot Jenks Math and Science Center funded by a $157 million bond proposal passed in December 2008.\n\nWith 120 seats, it is the largest planetarium on a high school campus in the world.\n\nSince opening three years ago, the planetarium has built a library of about 20 films.\n\nOf those, five were purchased, and 15 were made by Jenks students.\n\nStudents first produced a series on constellations because it was a natural starting point.\n\nNext came a piece for younger audiences about the solar system, one about tides and another a fun overview of astrology.\n\nThe goal is to produce two each year.\n\nDrama students handle the voice-over work, and the music department composes the music.\n\nTech-savvy students learn the programming \u0097 editing sound, creating animation and showing it on the dome.\n\nEventually, journalism and English students will be providing the research and scripts for the shows.\n\n\"Most people think this is college-level work,\" Zielinski said. \"It's hard work. But the students step up. When you give them the opportunity of this magnitude, they always step up and say, 'I can do that.'\n\n\"They get that empowerment. They are so wonderful, humble and willing to learn.\"\n\nProductions are viewed by the student body as part of classroom lessons, and they are made available for public viewings, as well.\n\nVarious topics: Just like the World War II piece, other topics are being explored.\n\nStudents are working on a show about the Sistine Chapel, which came from a request from the Advanced Placement art history teacher.\n\nIt will examine the history and symbolism of the paintings and an overview of artist Michelangelo's life.\n\n\"A normal person would look at the paintings and think, 'How pretty,' but the dome brings to life all these beautiful stories contained within them,\" Zielinski said.\n\nHis career has been in working at planetariums, beginning in one while studying science education at Bowling Green State University.\n\n\"I never thought it'd make me learn art and history,\" he said.\n\n\"I didn't know much about World War II. I am now fascinated with it. After going through the research, documentary and lessons, I want to know more about this.\n\n\"And who knew I'd be looking at art?\"\n\nJenks is among the first to have an interactive program called Sci-Touch, which allows for a gamelike experience.\n\nStudents will be able to identify constellations directly on the domes and take control of animated spaceships through the planets.\n\nWith policymakers and elected officials continuing to use test scores as a measure of academic achievement, the planetarium is going a different direction.\n\nIt demonstrates the effectiveness of hands-on learning.\n\nIt brings together disciplines in a seamless way, giving students a chance to gain real-world experience.\n\nIt also is expensive.\n\nThe public \u0097 and those elected officials \u0097 should recognize that money is needed to build a top-quality education system.\n\nJenks has shown that the investment is paying off.\n\nPlanetarium showings\n\nWhat: The public is welcome to view planetarium shows every Thursday at 7 or 8 p.m.; the times vary.\n\nWhere: Jenks Math and Science Center, Jenks High School\n\nCost: $5 for students, $7 for adults.\n\nFor more: For the latest on exact times and show titles, go to jenkscommunityed.com", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "A traditional map doesn't give a true sense of how far World War II soldiers went in traversing the Pacific Ocean.", "title": "Jenks Public Schools' planetarium puts the world at students' fingertips", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/jenks-public-schools-planetarium-puts-the-world-at-students-fingertips/article_edc70f60-3128-5875-8d7e-b242b9eeb88b.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/58/1583fd18-6a11-5df4-ad1a-0aee046e0c8d/52622f625d2b2.preview-500.jpg?resize=500%2C316", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A traditional map doesn't give a true sense of how far World War II soldiers went in traversing the Pacific Ocean.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "planetarium,films,jenks,students,zielinski,public,creating,dan,director,dome,local,ginniegraham,education,news,newshomepage2,communities,jenks,news,jenkshomepage1", "news_keywords": "planetarium,films,jenks,students,zielinski,public,creating,dan,director,dome,local,ginniegraham,education,news,newshomepage2,communities,jenks,news,jenkshomepage1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d4d\"", "article_summary": "It's two-dimensional,\" said Dan Zielinski, director of the Jenks Public Schools planetarium.\nA traditional map doesn't give a true sense of how far World War II soldiers went in traversing the Pacific Ocean.\nSince using the dome with the World War II study, students say, 'Wow, from California to Japan is a long way.'\nOf those, five were purchased, and 15 were made by Jenks students.\nPlanetarium showingsWhat: The public is welcome to view planetarium shows every Thursday at 7 or 8 p.m.; the times vary."}
