You know what this presidency needs? More Obamacare speeches. Crash:\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s overall job approval rating has fallen over the past year, and he gets low ratings for his handling of number of foreign policy issues. His job rating is below 40% for nine of 10 foreign policy issues tested, including his overall handling of the nation\u2019s foreign policy\u2026.Views of Obama\u2019s job performance in handling foreign policy issues are mostly on par with ratings of his performance on some domestic issues. The survey finds that 37% approve of the way Obama is handling health care and just 31% approve of his handling of the economy.\n\nSome additional data on the foreign policy questions \u2014 an area that was once (somehow) a public opinion refuge for this administration:\n\nO\u2019s pulling a robust 34/56 rating on overall foreign policy, 32/60 on immigration, and 37/53 on handling Iran. Nothing that a quick jaunt to Tehran can\u2019t fix, right? Wrong. Americans, quite understandably, don\u2019t trust the Iranian regime\u2019s intentions by an overwhelming margin. Self-identified Democrats are the lone exception, splitting roughly evenly on the question. Also notable is the public\u2019s total reversal in assessing Obama\u2019s relative strength on the world stage:\n\nBy a double-digit margin, Americans now say the Obama administration\u2019s global posture is too weak. I can\u2019t imagine why. Perhaps the president ought to start reminding people about the Bin Laden raid and bragging about how he\u2019s \u201creally good at killing people\u201d a little louder. I\u2019ll leave you with Pew\u2019s video summary of their findings. Your pull quote: \u201cThe share of the public saying [that the US is less \u2018important and powerful\u2019 today than it was ten years ago] has jumped 12 points since 2009\u201d to an all time high. Smart power:\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Weak.", "title": "Waterloo: Obama now below 40 percent approval on nearly every issue polled", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/12/04/waterloo-obama-now-below-40-percent-approval-on-nearly-every-issue-polled/", "image": "http://www.people-press.org/files/2013/12/12-3-2013-12.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-04T17:01:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-04T20:49:23+00:00"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, foreign policy, polls,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Crash:Barack Obama\u2019s overall job approval rating has fallen over the past year, and he gets low ratings for his handling of number of foreign policy issues.\nWaterloo: Obama now below 40 percent approval on nearly every issue polledposted at 12:01 pm on December 4, 2013 by Guy BensonA handy companion piece to AP\u2019s item from yesterday on Obama\u2019s RCP job approval average dipping below 40 percent for the first time.\nThe survey finds that 37% approve of the way Obama is handling health care and just 31% approve of his handling of the economy.\nHis job rating is below 40% for nine of 10 foreign policy issues tested, including his overall handling of the nation\u2019s foreign policy\u2026.Views of Obama\u2019s job performance in handling foreign policy issues are mostly on par with ratings of his performance on some domestic issues.\nSome additional data on the foreign policy questions \u2014 an area that was once (somehow) a public opinion refuge for this administration:O\u2019s pulling a robust 34/56 rating on overall foreign policy, 32/60 on immigration, and 37/53 on handling Iran."}
