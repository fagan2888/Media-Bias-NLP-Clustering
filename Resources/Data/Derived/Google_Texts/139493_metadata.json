(photo: CVS Caremark Corp.)\n\nWOONSOCKET, R.I. (WPRI) \u2013 MinuteClinics could be open in Rhode Island before the end of this year.\n\nCVS Caremark Corp., the Woonsocket-based drugstore giant, says it\u2019s in the process of getting permission to open MinuteClinics in its home state for the first time. The fast-growing chain of more than 800 retail health clinics offer services provided by certified nurse practitioners and physician assistants seven days a week. The cost for most visits starts at $79.\n\n\u201cWe hope to have the appropriate permissions and licensure by the middle of the year, and open the clinics before year end,\u201d CVS spokeswoman Carolyn Castel told WPRI.com.\n\nCVS is seeking to open seven MinuteClinics inside existing CVS/pharmacy stores in Cranston, East Greenwich, North Smithfield, Providence, Wakefield, Westerly and Woonsocket. MinuteClinics are already open across the border in Massachusetts in Seekonk, North Attleboro, Swansea, Taunton and Fall River, among other communities.\n\n\u201cWith the nationwide shortage of primary care providers, the addition of millions of newly insured patients through the Affordable Care Act and an aging Baby Boomer population, there is a significant and growing demand for care,\u201d Dr. Andrew Sussman, president of CVS\u2019s MinuteClinic division, said in November. \u201cMinuteClinic can help to meet that demand, collaborating with local provider groups, as part of a larger health care team.\u201d\n\nThe expansion of MinuteClinics is part of CVS Caremark\u2019s attempts to transform itself from a retail-oriented company into a health care-oriented one, as its executives emphasized last week when they announced CVS/pharmacy stores would stop selling tobacco products by Oct. 1. The company is aiming to have 1,500 MinuteClinics open in 35 states by 2017.\n\nR.I. Department of Health spokesman James Palmer said CVS filed an application Nov. 1 to obtain licenses for seven \u201corganized ambulatory care facilities,\u201d the formal name for a facility such as a MinuteClinic. Officials have asked CVS to provide more information, and the company expects to resubmit its applications this month, Castel said.\n\nSubmitting additional information to respond to the health department\u2019s questions \u201cis a normal part of the process,\u201d she said. MinuteClinic is always looking to participate in Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income Americans that\u2019s being expanded under President Obama\u2019s health law, in Rhode Island.\n\nOnce CVS submits its revised application, the powerful Rhode Island Health Services Council will conduct a 90-day review to decide whether to grant the MinuteClinic licenses, Palmer said.\n\nMinuteClinic was founded in Minneapolis in 2000 as QuickMedx. CVS bought the company in 2006 and moved its headquarters to Woonsocket four years later.\n\nCVS first attempted to open MinuteClinics in Rhode Island in 2005, but eventually dropped the idea amid opposition from doctors, who stand to lose business to the retail clinics and who warn they could get in the way of normal doctor-patient relationships.\n\nDr. Fredric Christian, then-president of the Rhode Island Medical Society, which lobbies for doctors, wrote at the time that \u201cby skimming away a certain volume of less complex and routine work, MinuteClinic will compromise the economic viability of some primary care practices.\u201d\n\nCVS considered opening MinuteClinics in Rhode Island again in late 2010, eyeing a partnership with Rhode Island Hospital parent Lifespan, before dropping the idea for a second time, according to the Medical Society.\n\nSteve DeToy, the society\u2019s director of government and public affairs, said the opening of MinuteClinics in Rhode Island remains \u201ca thorny issue\u201d for the doctors\u2019 group because it will take money from primary care and could lead to more fragmentation in the health system. But he also signaled they won\u2019t fight CVS this time.\n\n\u201cWe know they\u2019re inevitable,\u201d DeToy told WPRI.com. \u201cWe know they have some convenience factors that make them very appealing. \u2026 So they have some potential.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they stick to their original approach, which was to provide care that supplements primary care, then that\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they \u2026 keep seeming to expand what they want to do \u2013 chronic care management, physicals for kids \u2013 that\u2019s not something that we\u2019re interested in. \u2026 That\u2019s stuff that should be done in physicians\u2019 offices.\u201d The doctors may propose limiting what services can be done at MinuteClinics as has happened in some other states, he said.\n\nStill, DeToy said: \u201cWe\u2019re accepting the inevitable.\u201d (DeToy is a member of the Rhode Island Health Services Council, but said he will recuse himself from the MinuteClinic licensing decision.)\n\nCVS Caremark is Rhode Island\u2019s largest for-profit company and says it now employs more than 7,000 people in the state.\n\nTed Nesi ( tnesi@wpri.com ) covers politics and the economy for WPRI.com and writes the Nesi\u2019s Notes blog.
