( Hyoung Chang )\n\nDENVER -- Historical series records are rarely relevant indicators when it comes to the likelihood of one team beating another. This is especially true when it comes to collegiate athletics, where careers have a finite life span and rosters are constantly in flux.\n\nBut as history as shown, the Colorado and Denver women's soccer teams are about as evenly matched as two squads can possibly be.\n\nWith the two schools sharing a series tie at 8-8-1 entering Saturday's College Cup first-round match, something had to give. And though the teams played just about as level a match as could be, the Buffs were able to better the No. 4-seeded Pioneers thanks to a late goal from senior Anne Stuller, giving CU a 1-0 win at CIBER Field.\n\n\"Today's match could have gone either way,\" Colorado head coach Danny Sanchez said. \"I felt both teams played very well. Big moments take special players, and Anne Stuller is a special player. She came up and made the play when we needed.\"\n\nWith neither team conceding much defensively throughout, the game seemed destined to enter overtime with a nil-nil score. But after Colorado blocked a DU free kick in the 83rd minute, the Buffs quickly transitioned into the attack.\n\nFreshman Brie Hooks found the ball at her feet and raced through midfield toward the left edge of the penalty box. That's where she was tackled from behind by the Pioneers' Sam Harder, a foul which drew a yellow card and gave CU a free kick of its own from 25 yards out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStuller stepped to the ball and sent a shot toward goal, a ball that was deflected off the wall of Denver defenders. The change in direction was enough to knock keeper Rey Cassidy off balance, and the Pioneers could do nothing but watch as the ball sailed into the net for the game-winner.\n\n\"If I strike the ball cleanly, and if I get it over the wall, there's a good chance it's going to get a rebound or go in,\" Stuller said. \"That was my focus, just getting it over the wall but not over the net. And that's what I tried to do when I hit the ball.\"\n\nBoth teams struggled offensively throughout the match up until that point. While Denver was unable to put a shot on goal in the first 45 minutes of play, Colorado managed just two. The Buffs held the edge in total shots at intermission by a margin of 6-3.\n\nThe Buffs' best chance of the first half came in the 18th minute of play when Stuller found space in the right side of the box 15 yards out. Stuller hit a shot across the grass to the far post that Cassidy was just able to get her fingers on. A loose ball then sat in the middle of the box for a tense couple of seconds before a DU defender was able to clear it to the sidelines.\n\nThough Denver wasn't able to test Colorado keeper Annie Brunner throughout the first half, the Pioneers did have several decent build-ups of note. DU's strongest look came in the 25th minute, when Pioneer midfielder Nikki Pappalardo played a ball from the right end line to the center of the box. Anna Willis received the pass and touched it back to Francesca Garzelloni, who took a hit on her first touch that sailed a few feet over the crossbar.\n\nLittle changed in the second half, as the defenses only got stingier as the match wore and the physicality of the game increased. Denver had a chance in the 51st minute when Garzelloni received a pass from Willis eight yards out and fired a shot at net, but Brunner proved up to the challenge, fully-extending herself to make her first save of the match. The attempt was one of only three DU put on goal all night.\n\nDarcy Jerman had possibly the best chance for CU to score up until that point in the 64th minute, when she took a ball from Brooke Rice in the center of the box and fired it at the keeper, but Cassidy was able to tip the shot out of play. And though the Buffs had another chance on the ensuing corner, their header at the goal was blocked and cleared out of danger by a Pioneers defender.\n\nDenver seemed to have an opportunity in the 83rd minute after a foul on Colorado's Madison Krauser gave DU a free kick from 30 yards out. The ensuing ball was played into a crowd and eventually rolled out to the top of the 18. Denver's Shelby Wesley took another hit from there, but the low shot was blocked by a CU defender and eventually led to the key attack for the Buffs, culminating in the Colorado score.\n\nThe goal marked Stuller's team-leading ninth of the season and gave the Buffs a victory in Colorado's first tournament appearance since 2008. The win against No. 15 DU also marked the first time the Buffs have beaten a ranked opponent since 2010, when CU knocked off UCLA and Texas A&M in back-to-back games.\n\nColorado advances to play BYU, which knocked off Weber St. 4-0 in its first-round match. That second round game will be played Friday at Florida State.\n\n\"I think it's huge (for the program),\" Brunner said. \"We were both a part of the team that had four wins and that's never fun, and that wasn't that long ago. ... We tied for last place in the Pac-12 last year, and that wasn't any fun either. So being part of this team, it's energizing.\"\n\nAdded Sanchez: \"We're real proud of what this team's accomplished. They really bought in and have done everything we've asked. ... Especially our four senior starters, but really everybody. We're just real pleased that we are able to represent the University of Colorado on this stage.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-college-sports/ci_24539993/colorado-womens-soccer-buffs-knock-off-du-tourney", "sailthru.author": "By James Melillo  Buffzone.com", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:24539993:view"}, "startDate": "2013-11-16T20:24:51-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "DENVER -- Historical series records are rarely relevant indicators when it comes to the likelihood of one team beating another.", "title": "Colorado women's soccer: Buffs knock off DU in tourney opener", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-college-sports/ci_24539993/colorado-womens-soccer-buffs-knock-off-du-tourney", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/1116/20131116__17DCsCUS.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "CU & Other College Sports", "modificationDate": "2013-11-16T20:25:07-0700", "endDate": "2023-11-16T20:24:00-0700", "byline": "By James Melillo", "pubDate": "2013-11-16T20:26:21-0700", "sailthru.date": "2013-11-16T20:24:51-0700", "sailthru.title": "Colorado women's soccer: Buffs knock off DU in tourney opener", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/1116/20131116__17DCsCUS_300.jpg", "description": "DENVER -- Historical series records are rarely relevant indicators when it comes to the likelihood of one team beating another.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-college-sports/ci_24539993/colorado-womens-soccer-buffs-knock-off-du-tourney", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "DENVER -- Historical series records are rarely relevant indicators when it comes to the likelihood of one team beating another.", "title": "Colorado women's soccer: Buffs knock off DU in tourney opener"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2013/1116/20131116__17DCsCUS.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7fad\"", "article_summary": "But after Colorado blocked a DU free kick in the 83rd minute, the Buffs quickly transitioned into the attack.\nBut as history as shown, the Colorado and Denver women's soccer teams are about as evenly matched as two squads can possibly be.\nAnd though the teams played just about as level a match as could be, the Buffs were able to better the No.\nWhile Denver was unable to put a shot on goal in the first 45 minutes of play, Colorado managed just two.\nAdvertisementStuller stepped to the ball and sent a shot toward goal, a ball that was deflected off the wall of Denver defenders."}
