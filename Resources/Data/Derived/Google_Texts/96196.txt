ALBUQUERQUE — There are similarities between Saturday afternoon’s New Mexico Bowl participants Colorado State and Washington State.

Both teams are directed by a coach in his second year with the program.

And both improved by three victories over their 2012 record.

But regarding their offensive styles of play, CSU and the Cougars are quite different.

Under coach Jim McElwain, Colorado State (7-6, 5-3 Mountain West) strives for a balanced attack. The Rams became the only team to finish the regular season with both a 3,200-yard passer (Garrett Grayson) and a 1,500-yard rusher (Kapri Bibbs).

On the other hand, Washington State (6-6, 4-5 Pac-12) is directed by Mike Leach, perhaps the nation’s most pass-happy coach. The Cougars average 58 passes per game and threw as many as 89 passes in a game, in a loss to Oregon.

Washington State quarterback Connor Halliday ranks fourth nationally with 4,187 passing yards. He threw 28 touchdowns but also 21 interceptions.

Both teams have been potent on offense and sometimes inept on defense. Colorado State ranks No. 109 nationally in pass defense, Washington State rates No. 107.

It will be a surprise if anything but a high-scoring shootout erupts Saturday. This one could resemble a basketball score.

Often in bowl games, at least one of the teams will come out flat. Don’t expect that to occur here. Both teams should be hungry. Colorado State is playing in its first bowl in five years. An even decade has passed since the Cougars last participated in the postseason.

In the first game of the bowl season, will it be last team with the ball wins?

Kickoff is noon with ESPN handling the national telecast.
