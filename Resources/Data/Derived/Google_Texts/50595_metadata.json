The image showed a group of young boys gathered in a circle with their hands raised at an unusual angle. The AP\u2019s original caption on the photo said they were reciting the organization\u2019s \u201ccreed\u201d during a meeting in North Richland Hills, Texas.\n\nIt took the AP several days to acknowledge their error. But by then, the unfortunate comparison to Nazi Germany had spread on the Internet faster than Hitler\u2019s invasion of Poland.\n\n\u201cNew Trail Life scouting group excludes gay kids & they do a \u2018Sieg Heil! Style salute,\u201d tweeted Cathy Lynn Grossman of Religion News Service.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what it looked like.\n\n\u201cIt looks like some kind of German salute that was used during the Nazi period,\u201d Stemberger told me in a telephone interview.\n\nThe photograph ran last Sunday in newspapers across the nation and generated hundreds of angry emails and some threatening telephone calls to Trail Life headquarters.\n\nBut it turns out that the boys were not saluting Hitler and contrary to the first Associated Press caption, they were not reciting a creed. The boys were singing \u201cTaps,\u201d a longtime Boy Scout tradition that the Texas Trail USA troop had adapted as their own.\n\nThe boys had gathered in a circle with their hands raised straight into the air. They gradually lowered their hands as they sang the song. It concludes with their hands flush against their side.\n\n\u201cIt really misrepresented what was going on,\u201d Stemberger told me. \u201cThere are children involved and that made it more outrageous. They were exploited and misunderstood.\u201d\n\nSubsequently, Grossman removed her tweet and apologized, according to the GetReligion.org website.\n\nBut what really infuriated Stemberger was the Associated Press\u2019 initial reluctance to remove the photograph and correct the caption. The Trail Life leader provided me with email correspondence he had with Nomaan Merchant, the writer of the story.\n\n\u201cThis is really unconscionable,\u201d he wrote to Merchant on Sunday, March 2. \u201cYou told me Saturday afternoon you were going to immediately have the AP photo removed completely because children were involved and being photographed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is unfair,\u201d he continued. \u201cReasonable minds will not differ on this. Ask any third party what they think this photo is. I told you this exact thing would happen if the photo was not removed.\u201d\n\nNomaan struck an apologetic tone in his correspondence and told Stemberger he would try to have the photograph removed.\n\n\u201cI was told that that\u2019s generally reserved only for photos that are doctored or so otherwise egregious that they cannot stand otherwise,\u201d Nomaan wrote.\n\nSo apparently a photograph that gives the impression that young boys are saluting Hitler (when in fact they were not) is not egregious enough for the Associated Press?\n\nMerchant wrote to Stemberger that he showed the photo to some of his colleagues and they didn\u2019t seem to have a problem with it.\n\n\u201cI really do think it\u2019s a nice image of the boys singing a song,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAs an aside, I showed the same photograph to some of my colleagues here at the Fox News Corner of the World and every single person said it looked like boys saluting Hitler.\n\nMerchant did offer an apology and said he regrets \u201cany misconceptions due to this one image.\u201d\n\n\u201cI take very seriously the issue of media bias and did my best to give full weight to all perspectives in the story, which I had a lot more control over,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the truth.\n\nStemberger said Trail Life was pleased with Merchant\u2019s story. He called it \u201cfair minded and straightforward. And he also understands that the reporter was not responsible for selecting the photographs that were used.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, the Associated Press had still not corrected the caption or removed the photo. So Stemberger posted a message on the Trail Life Facebook page explaining the situation to confused members and angry outsiders. A member of the Trail Life team also called me.\n\nOn Tuesday, I reached out to Associated Press to get their side of the story and received a prompt reply.\n\n\u201cAny suggestion that the photo shows the boys giving a salute was unintentional,\u201d AP spokesman Paul Colford told me.\n\nHe also said AP had decided to correct the inaccurate caption. The corrected copy states the boys were singing taps.\n\nThe AP later confirmed to Erik Wemple\u2019s Washington Post that the photo would be removed from its archives.\n\nAssociated Press did the right thing \u2013 albeit in a less than timely manner. Still, the damage has already been done. Liberal bloggers are having a field day with the photograph \u2013 at the expense of young patriotic boys.\n\nAnd lest there be any confusion at AP headquarters, any photograph that exploits children is egregious.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cI was horrified,\u201d said John Stemberger, chairman of the board of Trail Life USA, a new, rapidly-growing scouting organization that doesn\u2019t allow openly gay members..05/24/2016 14:45:24PM EST.", "author": "Todd Starnes", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\u201cI was horrified,\u201d said John Stemberger, chairman of the board of Trail Life USA, a new, rapidly-growing scouting organization that doesn\u2019t allow openly gay members.", "title": "Todd Starnes - AP Smears Trail Life Boys with Misleading 'Nazi' Photo", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2014/03/06/ap-smears-trail-life-boys-with-misleading-nazi-photo-n1805270", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/60/38701c70-705b-4c84-89c7-b21952ff0e06.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\u201cI was horrified,\u201d said John Stemberger, chairman of the board of Trail Life USA, a new, rapidly-growing scouting organization that doesn\u2019t allow openly gay members.", "title": "Todd Starnes - AP Smears Trail Life Boys with Misleading 'Nazi' Photo", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/toddstarnes/2014/03/06/ap-smears-trail-life-boys-with-misleading-nazi-photo-n1805270", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/60/38701c70-705b-4c84-89c7-b21952ff0e06.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "AP Smears Trail Life Boys with Misleading 'Nazi' Photo, Todd Starnes, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbfa6\"", "article_summary": "The Trail Life leader provided me with email correspondence he had with Nomaan Merchant, the writer of the story.\nStemberger was referring to an Associated Press photograph that accompanied an in-depth story about Trail Life.\n\u201cNew Trail Life scouting group excludes gay kids & they do a \u2018Sieg Heil!\n\u201cIt looks like some kind of German salute that was used during the Nazi period,\u201d Stemberger told me in a telephone interview.\nSo Stemberger posted a message on the Trail Life Facebook page explaining the situation to confused members and angry outsiders."}
