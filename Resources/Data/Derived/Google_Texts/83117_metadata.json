Ortiz.\n\n\u201cThis settlement is part of the government\u2019s continuing effort to ensure that the provision of care in skilled nursing facilities is based on patients\u2019 clinical needs and not tied to the financial targets of the companies providing their care,\u201d Ortiz said in a statement. \u201cTo its credit, ArchCare cooperated with the government\u2019s investigation and took steps to address the issues that were revealed during the investigation.\u201d\n\nThe government took ArchCare\u2019s cooperation and its current practices into account in reaching the resolution.\n\nArchCare operates Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center in New York City and Ferncliff Nursing Home in Rhinebeck, New York, and it previously operated Kateri Residence in New York City.\n\nArchCare\u2019s subcontractor is Physical and Occupational Rehabilitation Therapy and Speech-Pathology Services, PLLC, an affiliate of RehabCare Group East, Inc., and Kindred Healthcare, Inc., according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\nThis settlement also resolves allegations that ArchCare failed to prevent other RehabCare practices designed to inflate Medicare reimbursement, including: presumptively placing patients in the highest reimbursement level unless it was shown that the patients could not tolerate that amount of therapy, rather than using individualized evaluations to determine the level of care most suitable for each patient\u2019s clinical needs; planning the minimum number of minutes of therapy required to bill at the highest reimbursement level while discouraging the provision of therapy in amounts beyond that minimum threshold, despite the Medicare requirement that the amount of care provided be determined by patients\u2019 clinical needs; arbitrarily shifting the number of minutes of planned therapy between different therapy disciplines to ensure targeted reimbursement levels were achieved; reporting that time spent on initial evaluations was therapy time in order to avoid the Medicare prohibition on counting initial evaluation time as reimbursable therapy time; reporting that time spent providing unskilled palliative care was time spent on reimbursable skilled therapy; and reporting estimated or rounded minutes instead of reporting the actual minutes of therapy provided.\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/new-york-catholic-nursing-chain-pays-35-million-settle-medicare-fraud-claims", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/generic-nursing-home-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The Catholic Health Care System, aka ArchCare, allowed Medicare to be billed for patient care at the highest therapy-based levels, even though its subcontractor RehabCare, was often not providing therapy at those levels, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.", "title": "New York Catholic nursing chain pays $3.5 million to settle Medicare fraud claims"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/generic-nursing-home-feature.gif"}, "title": "New York Catholic nursing chain pays $3.5 million to settle Medicare fraud claims", "description": "The Catholic Health Care System, aka ArchCare, allowed Medicare to be billed for patient care at the highest therapy-based levels, even though its subcontractor RehabCare, was often not providing therapy at those levels, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width;
