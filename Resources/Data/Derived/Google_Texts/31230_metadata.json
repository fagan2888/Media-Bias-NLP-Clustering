Since then, CNN has gone all in on the story, dedicating nearly 100% of its coverage to flight 370, despite the fact that very little in the way of concrete facts or evidence have emerged. One week later, the flight\u2019s disappearance seems to be as much of a mystery as it was when it first happened.\n\nThis has led to quite a bit of\u2026 speculation on the part of CNN\u2019s anchors, reporters, correspondents and guests. The latest \u201cexclusive\u201d theory to appear on the network\u2019s website involves the highly unlikely scenario that the plane landed on a remote island in the Indian Ocean.\n\nAs New Day host Chris Cuomo explained on Wednesday there are more questions than answers in a story like this and the reason CNN stays on top of it so intensely is that \u201cbeing everywhere the story is\u201d grants them the best shot at breaking any actual new developments.\n\nIt\u2019s also been an unexpected boon for the network\u2019s ratings, as Anderson Cooper found out Wednesday night when he beat Fox\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly in the key 25-54 demo for the first time in almost a year. The network experienced a similar boon when they went wall-to-wall on Ukraine, albeit with much less speculation-centric coverage.\n\nOf course, the other big cable outlets, Fox and MSNBC, have been covering this story, but no one has been nearly as obsessively dedicated as CNN.\n\nAnd as the video below attests, a lot of the network\u2019s conversation over the past week has been alarmingly long on airing speculation and seriously short on concrete facts.\n\nWatch below:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's been one week since Malaysia Airlines flight 370 mysteriously disappeared with 239 people on board.
