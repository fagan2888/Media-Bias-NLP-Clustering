However, the FMA staunchly opposes giving NPs autonomy and said \u201cthe best solution is physicians and nurses working collaboratively in a way that does not jeopardize patient safety.\u201d\n\nPrimary care physicians are perceived as the \u201cquarterbacks\u201d of the healthcare team who are responsible for enhancing quality and reducing costs, two hallmarks of healthcare delivery in the post-reform era. Doctors argued that they receive more training than nurse practitioners and that care should be offered through a collaborative approach led by physicians.\n\nSOME LEGISLATORS AND THE FHA SUPPORT REGULATORY CHANGE\n\nLegislative leaders have said they are concerned about a combination of factors, which includes, not only the ACA\u2019s newly insured but also a growing state population, aging baby-boomers and the fact that primary care practitioners are also aging and their ranks may not be adequately replenished, that creates a significant challenge to meeting the increased demands for health care.\n\nDemand for family physicians, general internists and other primary care doctors is also being driven in part by a proliferating number of healthcare service sites, including multi-hospital systems, large medical groups, urgent care centers, retail clinics, free-standing emergency departments, community health centers, government facilities and traditional community hospitals.\n\nIn Florida, there are 19,000 NPs, who are officially licensed as Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioners (ARNP). Supporters of a change in NPs\u2019 regulatory status that would provide more autonomy and subsequently easier access to primary care for the increasing demand includes the Florida Hospital Association (FHA).\n\nFMA\u2019S PLAN FOCUSES ON INCENTIVES FOR MORE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS\n\nRather than grant more autonomy to NPs to practice out on their own, not just as a staff member in a doctor\u2019s practice, the FMA has proposed a five-point strategic plan to address the primary care shortage, which includes additional funding for family practice residency slots, fair pay for family doctors who treat Medicaid patients, new technologies such as telemedicine, and a student loan forgiveness program geared to primary care.\n\nAs for NPs, the FMA called for \u201cnew business models that expand collaborative relationships.\u201d\n\nThe committee will meet three more times prior to the regular session, which starts March 4. This debate, focused on the question: \u201cTo innovate, do we need to deregulate?\u201d will continue to hinge on what services that trained doctors and nurses in the appropriate settings can deliver to meet the increasing demands for primary care and ensure safe, high quality healthcare.\n\nClick here to contribute your news or announcements Free", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "affordable care act,doctor shortage,florida house of representatives,florida medical association,nurse practitioners,obamacare,slider", "og": {"image": "http://spacecoastdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/DOCS-NURSE-435-13.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 1204082483, "app_id": 644760862318465}, "description": "Healthcare facilities in Florida and nationwide are gearing up to meet the enhanced demand for primary care physicians that has begun with millions of people", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda704\"", "article_summary": "Nurse practitioners (NP) and physician assistants (PA), frequently called \u201cmidlevel providers\u201d or \u201cphysician extenders,\u201d play an essential role in providing primary care and in helping to meet the ever-increasing need for more primary care resources.\nPhysicians and Nurses At Odds Over NP AutonomyBy Dr. James Palermo // January 13, 2014FMA: CARE THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH, BUT LED BY PHYSICIANSHealthcare facilities in Florida and nationwide are gearing up to meet the enhanced demand for primary care physicians that has begun with millions of people obtaining health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA, aka Obamacare).\nNURSE PRACTITIONERS SEEK DEREGULATIONExisting Florida law requires NPs and PAs to work under the supervision of a physician.\nDoctors argued that they receive more training than nurse practitioners and that care should be offered through a collaborative approach led by physicians.\nPhysicians told the committee that NPs were valuable members of the healthcare delivery team and that they agree on the need for new approaches to expand primary care."}
