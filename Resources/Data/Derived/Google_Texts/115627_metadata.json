Landeskog had been relegated to cheerleader duty, a position that didn\u2019t sit well with the Avalanche captain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited to get back,\u201d he said before Sunday\u2019s game. \u201cIt seems like any other point of the season it would have been three, four, five days at the most. It felt too long, but I\u2019m ready to get back at it.\n\nAvs Mailbag: Pose a question for Terry Frei, Mike Chambers\n\n\u201cEverybody that watched it with me knows I don\u2019t have the nerve to watch. I\u2019d much rather be out there.\n\n\u201cThis time of year every shift means so much and every play means so much, it really was tough watching.\u201d\n\nRantanen, the Avalanche\u2019s top prospect, was called up Saturday night from the San Antonio Rampage of the American Hockey League in the wake of the knee injury to MacKinnon.\n\nAvs coach Patrick Roy had no update Sunday at the morning skate as to the severity of Mac- Kinnon\u2019s injury.\n\n\u201cWhen we get to Denver, he will meet with our team doctors and from there we\u2019ll have a better idea,\u201d Roy said.\n\nRantanen played in Colorado\u2019s first six games without registering a point.\n\nThe Avalanche\u2019s first-round pick in the 2015 draft (10th overall) found his groove in the AHL, registering 21 goals and 52 points in 44 games.\n\nRantanen was drafted as a winger, but he had transitioned to center in the AHL before the Avalanche promoted him. The move could prove to be fruitful, now that the Avs are without their top two centers for an undetermined period.\n\n\u201cI played center in the AHL for the last 15 games, so it\u2019s not new, but the players (in the NHL) are faster and better,\u201d Rantanen said. \u201cYou have to play defense better and bear down on face- offs. There\u2019s some really good faceoff guys in this league.\u201d\n\nRoy said before Sunday\u2019s game that the Finn would start out on the fourth line between Jack Skille and Cody McLeod.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to put too much pressure on him to start with,\u201d Roy said, \u201cbut we\u2019ll give him the chance to go on the ice and adapt and we\u2019ll see from there.\u201d\n\nThe question about Rantanen isn\u2019t an issue of where he slots in, but for how long. If the 19-year-old forward plays four games more with Colorado, he will burn a year of his entry- level deal, costing the Avs a year of cost-effective control.\n\nRoy wouldn\u2019t say how long Rantanen\u2019s call-up would last. Count on Rantanen to give his best effort in an attempt to stay with the Avalanche long term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a dream to play in this league,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to play with this team when they are doing well right now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avs captain Gabe Landeskog returns from suspension: \u2018It felt too long\u2019", "title": "Avs captain Gabe Landeskog returns from suspension: \u2018It felt too long\u2019", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/20/avs-captain-gabe-landeskog-returns-from-suspension-it-felt-too-long/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160320__Gabe_Landeskogp1.jpg", "height": 580}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160320__Gabe_Landeskogp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-20T16:14:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T01:04:18+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3205\"", "article_summary": "Landeskog hadn\u2019t played since March 9, having served his three-game suspension for a cross-check to the head of Anaheim\u2019s Simon Depres.\nLandeskog had been relegated to cheerleader duty, a position that didn\u2019t sit well with the Avalanche captain.\nAvs coach Patrick Roy had no update Sunday at the morning skate as to the severity of Mac- Kinnon\u2019s injury.\nRantanen played in Colorado\u2019s first six games without registering a point.\nThe move could prove to be fruitful, now that the Avs are without their top two centers for an undetermined period."}
