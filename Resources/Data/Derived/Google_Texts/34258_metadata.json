They now have an insurance plan available to them that will not require that mandatory abortion fee,\u201d said Deacon Barth Bracy, the executive director of Rhode Island Right to Life Committee.\n\nDeacon Bracy, though, called it a \u201cpartial victory,\u201d telling the Register that serious abortion-related problems remain in the health-care law popularly known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that it\u2019s still an outrage that a state-owned and operated entity, HealthSource RI, facilitates the sale of abortion coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cThe state shouldn\u2019t be doing that. Taxpayer funds should not be used to facilitate the buying and selling of coverage to kill babies.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiff\u2019s attorneys withdrew the lawsuit when Rhode Island state officials agreed to make available a health-insurance plan with no elective abortion coverage, guaranteeing that no portion of the monthly premium will be placed in an account that is used to cover the cost of elective abortion claims.\n\n\u201cThe state will say they would have done this regardless, but what we say is that they had not done this. They had put people like Mr. Doe in this position. They were not offering options,\u201d said Casey Mattox, senior counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal firm that represented the anonymous plaintiff in Doe v. Burwell.\n\nThe plaintiff, who is HIV-positive, had not enrolled in a health-care plan in 2015 because of the abortion surcharge. He sued the state and federal government, citing the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Rhode Island version of that law.\n\nAs part of the settlement, the state will pay the plaintiff\u2019s monthly premiums from March through December as if he had enrolled, thus preventing him from facing fines under the individual mandate for failing to maintain coverage for the 2015 tax year.\n\nMattox told the Register that the settlement allows Doe to continue receiving AIDS Drug Assistance Program benefits under the federal Ryan White program.\n\n\u201cOur client desperately needed a plan, a plan that would both not include the abortion-payment requirement, but one that would also comply with some of the other requirements for a person in the HIV programs he was participating in,\u201d Mattox said.\n\nGov. Raimondo Signs Budget Bill\n\nShortly after the pro-life victory, Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo signed a state budget bill that included a rider that incorporated language from the settlement in Doe v. Burwell. The new law requires six \u201cindividual market\u201d plans on HealthSource RI that exclude coverage for elective abortion, with an additional three plans available, by request, in a modified variation that also exclude abortion coverage.\n\nThe law also allows employers who request a religious exemption to choose and offer health plans to employees that exclude abortion coverage. The employees will still have access to all health plans available through the exchange, said Maria Tocco, a spokeswoman for HealthSource RI.\n\n\u201cRegardless of whether an employee chooses a plan that includes or excludes coverage for most abortions, the employee pays the cost of the difference between the employer\u2019s contribution and the plan price,\u201d Tocco told the Register.\n\nSaid Tocco, \u201cThis new provision for small business market health plans was not prompted by the Doe v. Burwell lawsuit that involved individual and family market health plans.\u201d\n\nThe new health-care offerings for pro-lifers angered several Raimondo supporters, who noted that the Democratic governor was endorsed by pro-abortion political action committees such as Emily\u2019s List and Planned Parenthood Votes during her 2014 gubernatorial run.\n\nOrganizations such as Planned Parenthood of Southern New England and the ACLU of Rhode Island said they were surprised and disappointed that the governor had signed off on the budget, arguing that the amended exchange undermines access to comprehensive women\u2019s health care and could cause up to 9,000 Rhode Island residents to lose abortion coverage. State officials said enrollees were notified by mail about the changes as well as what plans still cover abortion.\n\nMeanwhile, Deacon Bracy said that Raimondo, despite her pro-abortion allegiances, had no choice but to sign the budget bill.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe she had any type of conversion,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not her abandoning her principles. It\u2019s simply her realizing, \u2018We did something wrong, and if we don\u2019t settle, the courts are going to rule against us.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Next Battleground: Vermont\n\nThe pro-life victory in Rhode Island marks the second time that Deacon Bracy has successfully challenged a state health-care exchange for its abortion policies. The deacon, who lives just over the state line in Connecticut, last year sued that state\u2019s health-care exchange to force it to provide a health plan that did not include premiums to pay for abortions. Deacon Bracy and his wife, who were also represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, withdrew their lawsuit last November when Connecticut agreed to offer such a plan.\n\n\u201cBoth Connecticut and Rhode Island knew what they did was illegal,\u201d Deacon Bracy said. \u201cThe government in both cases settled because I think they knew they would lose. It was like they were a kid with his hand in the cookie jar. They didn\u2019t even try to argue. They just said, \u2018Okay, what do we have to do to make this go away?\u2019\u201d\n\nMattox, of Alliance Defending Freedom, said his organization is now handling a similar case in Vermont, which he said so far has resisted calls to change its state health-care exchange.\n\nSaid Mattox, \u201cWe\u2019re in litigation right now.\u201d\n\nRegister correspondent Brian Fraga writes from Fall River, Massachusetts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It\u2019s the second such victory in a New England state in the last two years, safeguarding pro-life\u2026", "og": {"site_name": "National Catholic Register", "description": "It\u2019s the second such victory in a New England state in the last two years, safeguarding pro-life residents from being forced to subsidi...", "title": "Pro-Life Win in Rhode Island \u2014 Abortion-Free Health Plans Added to State Exchange", "url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/pro-life-win-in-rhode-island-abortion-free-health-plans-added-to-state-exch/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/Bracy4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/pro-life-win-in-rhode-island-abortion-free-health-plans-added-to-state-exch/", "image": "http://www.ncregister.com/images/editorial/Bracy4.jpg", "description": "It\u2019s the second such victory in a New England state in the last two years, safeguarding pro-life residents from being forced to subsidi...", "card": "summary", "title": "Pro-Life Win in Rhode Island \u2014 Abortion-Free Health Plans Added to State Exchange"}, "fb": {"admins": 1477213784, "app_id": 347756275321330}, "keywords": "National Catholic Register, abortion, alliance defending freedom, contraception, health insurance, hhs mandate, obamacare, rhode island", "google-site-verification": "fH2AP0niyimtMl7gbXZxEEOYh0-SDCGbWnO5xzGZ7Ag", "verify-v1": "YalzSEdGEZFJXAYZujFlKPI/ZbVQzE2JcUWO5z743BQ="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbe37\"", "article_summary": "The employees will still have access to all health plans available through the exchange, said Maria Tocco, a spokeswoman for HealthSource RI.\nThe law also allows employers who request a religious exemption to choose and offer health plans to employees that exclude abortion coverage.\nRaimondo Signs Budget BillShortly after the pro-life victory, Rhode Island Gov.\nHe sued the state and federal government, citing the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Rhode Island version of that law.\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that it\u2019s still an outrage that a state-owned and operated entity, HealthSource RI, facilitates the sale of abortion coverage,\u201d he said."}
