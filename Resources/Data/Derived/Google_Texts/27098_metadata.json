Getty Images\n\nPimco\u2019s parting of ways with Bill Gross was the business equivalent of ripping off a Band-Aid: abrupt and immediately painful.\n\nGross, a co-founder of Pacific Investment Management Co., quit last week under threat of getting fired. Now, as billions of dollars follow him out the door, the firm\u2019s executives are working to persuade clients to stick with them despite the loss of the legendary investor. Chief Executive Douglas Hodge has said he is optimistic, calling the split an opportunity to evolve the company \u201cfrom a founder-led approach to a team environment.\u201d\n\nFor company leaders, a bold move that results in immediate losses can be tough to stomach, especially one that sparks a backlash from investors and stakeholders. But whether cutting ties with a difficult yet brilliant talent or ditching a revenue stream, management experts say that big short-term sacrifices are sometimes the secret to long-term success\u2014provided bosses get their timing right.\n\nThe fact that executives were planning to oust Mr. Gross suggests they were willing to make a tough call for the sake of preserving Pimco\u2019s culture and retaining talented employees, even if that meant losing the face of the company.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t give that up unless there\u2019s a really good reason,\u201d says Paul Argenti, a professor of corporate communications at Dartmouth College\u2019s Tuck School of Business.\n\nTo be sure, recent flagging returns mitigated the risks of parting with Mr. Gross, who helped start the firm in 1971. Pimco Total Return, the fund Mr. Gross had managed and the largest such fund in the world, gained 3.3% in the 12 months ended Sept. 25, compared with 4.4% for the average intermediate-term bond-fund peer over the same period, according to research firm Morningstar\n\n\u201cIt was easier to make that decision now than it might have been five or ten years ago,\u201d Mr. Argenti says.\n\nA Pimco representative did not return a request for comment.\n\nCVS Health, the nation\u2019s second-largest pharmacy chain, shocked many earlier this year by deciding to end sales of tobacco, giving up $2 billion in annual sales. CVS is betting that its tobacco-free stance will bolster its business as a provider of basic health services and as an administrator of prescription-drug benefits, generating revenues over the long term. The firm even changed its name from CVS Caremark Corp. to reflect its broader mission.\n\nA CVS cashier retrieves cigarettes for a customer in a New York store.

At the same time, the Affordable Care Act has presented a business opportunity to deliver health care to newly insured Americans.\n\nCVS\u2019s shares have risen more than 20% since the February announcement. So far, no other national pharmacy chains have followed CVS to drop cigarettes.\n\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s never a right time to walk away from $2 billion in revenue, this was the right time,\u201d CVS President and Chief Executive Larry Merlo told The Wall Street Journal last month. \u201cEliminating this obstacle will allow our company to grow over the long term.\u201d\n\nCVS did not return requests for comment.\n\nPatience is a tough sell in a business climate dominated by the strident voices of activist investors, leadership consultants say.\n\n\u201cManagers have to deliver short-term results, and that becomes a habit,\u201d says Jo Whitehead, a director of Ashridge Strategic Management Centre in London and co-author of the book \u201cThink Again: Why Good Leaders Make Bad Decisions and How to Keep it From Happening to You.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to change that mindset,\u201d Mr. Whitehead says.\n\nWhen the timing isn\u2019t right, bold strategic shifts can backfire. Netflix in September 2011 announced a plan to split its movie-streaming business and DVD-by-mail service into two separate websites. When the move was announced, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings indicated that he was willing to take a short-term hit from customers in order to solidify the firm as a digital business. But the plan to split the sites, which came on top of a price hike, was scotched three weeks later, amid an exodus of some 800,000 angry U.S. subscribers that quarter.\n\n\u201cThere is a difference between moving quickly\u2014which Netflix has done very well for years\u2014and moving too fast, which is what we did in this case,\u201d Mr. Hastings said in a statement when he repealed the move in October 2011. Since then, Netflix\u2019s business has thrived and its share price has more than tripled.\n\nIn 2011, Netflix quickly rolled back a planned split of its movie-streaming business and DVD-by-mail service. Associated Press\n\nThe good news for bold bosses: there\u2019s no evidence that, over the long run, markets penalize executives who take a short-term hit for the sake of a strategy shift, says Michael Mankins, a partner at Bain & Co. and head of organization practices for the consultancy\u2019s Americas region.\n\nMarkets may overreact as they digest new information, Mr. Mankins says, but investors eventually come around if the decision was well-timed and drives up the company\u2019s value over time.\n\n\u201cIf alternative A is better than alternative B, but it has a negative near-term consequence, you should still pick it,\u201d he says.\n\nAt Pimco, the near-term remains fraught. Morningstar this week downgraded its rating of Pimco Total Return to bronze from gold, citing uncertainty over the management shuffle. Still, analyst Eric Jacobson said the overall outlook for the fund remains positive.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Short-term sacrifices are sometimes the secret to success.", "title": "No Pain, No Gain: When Bosses Need to Rip the Band-Aid", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/10/02/no-pain-no-gain-when-bosses-need-to-rip-the-band-aid/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EU705_pimco__P_20141001152042.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Careers", "article.headline": "No Pain, No Gain: When Bosses Need to Rip the Band-Aid", "description": "Short-term sacrifices are sometimes the secret to success.", "article_section": "Careers", "author": "Adam Auriemma and Rachel Emma Silverman", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "At Work Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "At Work", "article.summary": "Short-term sacrifices are sometimes the secret to success.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-02T14:56:53-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/10/02/no-pain-no-gain-when-bosses-need-to-rip-the-band-aid/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-ATWORKB-2076", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Careers", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Short-term sacrifices are sometimes the secret to success.", "title": "No Pain, No Gain: When Bosses Need to Rip the Band-Aid", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/10/02/no-pain-no-gain-when-bosses-need-to-rip-the-band-aid/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-EU705_pimco__P_20141001152042.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "At Work", "article.id": "BL-ATWORKB-2076", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-02T15:01:06-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb395\"", "article_summary": "Getty ImagesPimco\u2019s parting of ways with Bill Gross was the business equivalent of ripping off a Band-Aid: abrupt and immediately painful.\nMorningstar this week downgraded its rating of Pimco Total Return to bronze from gold, citing uncertainty over the management shuffle.\nNetflix in September 2011 announced a plan to split its movie-streaming business and DVD-by-mail service into two separate websites.\nPatience is a tough sell in a business climate dominated by the strident voices of activist investors, leadership consultants say.\nBill Gross, the co-founder of Pimco, was the face of the company before he left."}
