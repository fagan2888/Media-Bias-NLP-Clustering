But the Daily Kos is having none of it. It rejects that polling, which was conducted by McLaughlin & Associates, for reasons that don\u2019t rise to a level that merits refutation. It instead touts a survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation, calling Kaiser \u201cthe gold standard\u201d in Obamacare polling.\n\nThis claim is worth examining because many Republicans are also under the mistaken impression that they should view Kaiser\u2019s Obamacare polling as the gold standard, or at least as being quite credible. In reality, Kaiser is a pro-Obamacare outfit, and its polling has long shown better results for Obamacare than one can expect to find anywhere else.\n\nFor example, in April 2010, the month immediately following the Democrats\u2019 passage of Obamacare over unanimous Republican congressional opposition, Real Clear Politics published eleven polls on Obamacare\u2019s popularity, or lack thereof, from eight different outlets. All eleven polls found that (much like today) Obamacare faced a clear public-approval deficit. On average, those eleven polls found Obamacare facing a 13-point approval deficit (with 40 percent supporting it and 53 percent opposing it), with the specific deficits ranging from five points in Resurgent Republic\u2019s polling (44 percent support, 49 percent opposition) to 21 points in polling from CBS News (32 percent support, 53 percent opposition).\n\nSo what did Kaiser (which didn\u2019t \u2014 and doesn\u2019t \u2014 even make the cut for RCP) show at that time? Well, Kaiser\u2019s April 2010 Health Tracking Poll said that Obamacare enjoyed a six-point public-approval advantage (46 percent support, 40 percent opposition) \u2014 a whopping 19-point swing from the average of the polling listed that month by RCP, and an eleven-point swing from even the most favorable of the Obamacare polls listed by RCP.\n\nFast-forwarding four years, Kaiser\u2019s September 2014 Health Tracking Poll asked, \u201cWhat would you rather see your representative in Congress do when it comes to the health care law?\u201d The options Kaiser provided were, \u201cWork to improve the law,\u201d or \u201cWork to repeal the law and replace it with something else.\u201d\n\nKaiser didn\u2019t provide the option of passing \u201can alternative to Obamacare,\u201d or \u201ca conservative alternative.\u201d It simply offered up \u201csomething else.\u201d Not only could that \u201csomething else\u201d be a single-payer system (which might help explain why only 61 percent of Republicans chose that option), but it seems a pretty safe bet that nearly anything \u2014 and especially trying to fix nearly anything \u2014 would beat scrapping that thing and replacing it with \u201csomething else.\u201d Imagine a GOP candidate saying during a debate, \u201cWe should repeal Obamacare. And we should replace it with . . . something else.\u201d Moreover, many people who want Obamacare to be repealed in 2017 still want those in Congress to work to try to improve it in the interim. So even those who picked \u201cimprove\u201d weren\u2019t necessarily opposed to \u201crepeal.\u201d\n\nBy asking the question in this peculiar way, Kaiser managed to get 63 percent of respondents to say they want Congress to work to \u201cimprove\u201d Obamacare, while only 33 percent said they favor \u201crepeal\u201d and \u201csomething else.\u201d\n\nIf anyone still thinks this Kaiser result indicates genuine opposition to repeal \u2014 despite Kaiser\u2019s track record and its wording of the question \u2014 another result from the very same survey should quickly dispel that notion. Kaiser provided a list of things that congressional candidates could potentially do, asking, \u201cWould [doing that thing] make you more likely to vote for that candidate, less likely, or wouldn\u2019t it make much difference in your vote?\u201d Kaiser listed one of the potential actions someone could have undertaken as, \u201cVoted to repeal the health care law.\u201d By a double-digit margin, respondents said that a candidate\u2019s having voted for the repeal of Obamacare would make them more (41 percent) not less (30 percent) likely to vote for that candidate.\n\nAnd even this is still a question about straight repeal. If Kaiser had instead asked about repeal in the context of an alternative, its result would likely have been closer to what McLaughlin & Associates found \u2014 namely, that voters overwhelmingly want to ditch Obamacare.
