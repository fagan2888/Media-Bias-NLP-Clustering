The Colorado Mammoth acquired forward Drew Westervelt, who has scored 30-plus goals in four of his past five seasons in the National Lacrosse League, from the Philadelphia Wings.

Colorado gave up two second-round selections in 2013, a first-round pick in 2015, and transition player Ryan Hotaling to acquire the 28-year-old, 6-foot-5 forward and a fourth-round pick in Monday’s entry draft.

“Drew’s a big, dominant, and strong offensive force in the NLL,” said Mammoth president and general manager Steve Govett. “He has adapted extremely well to the indoor game, and will have a major impact on our offense.”
