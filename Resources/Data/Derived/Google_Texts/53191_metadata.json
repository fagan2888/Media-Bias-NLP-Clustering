Here is a Q-and-A on how it works.\n\nTo avoid the morality police, some Iranian women are dressing like men\n\nWith eye on South China Sea, China's neighbors weave new web of security\n\nObamacare facts: How will the law affect you?\n\nPeople sign up for health insurance information at a Covered California event which marks the opening of the states's Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, health insurance marketplace in Los Angeles, Calif., October 1, 2013.\n\nOct. 1 marked the start of a separate online health-insurance marketplace for small business owners, known as the Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP.\n\nSHOP is designed to help owners of small businesses \u2013 those with fewer than 50 full-time-equivalent employees \u2013 provide health insurance for their employees in a cost-effective way. Business owners who enroll may qualify for a health-care tax credit worth up to 50 percent of the cost of premiums.\n\nAs with online exchanges for individuals, the SHOP exchanges \u2013 one for each state and the District of Columbia \u2013 can be accessed via HealthCare.gov. The site will direct you to your state\u2019s exchange.\n\nIf your state is running its own exchange, you can already enroll online. If your state opted for a federally run exchange, online enrollment starts Nov. 1. In all states, you can enroll over the phone, in person, or via a paper application sent in the mail. Coverage begins on Jan. 1, 2014.\n\nHere are some questions and answers about SHOP:\n\nWhy can\u2019t a small business owner just send his or her employees to the exchange for individuals and families?\n\nThat\u2019s certainly an option, but as with large businesses, small businesses can attract good employees by offering health coverage. The purpose of SHOP is to provide small business owners with a cheap source of insurance.\n\nWill the plans on SHOP actually be cheaper than in the open market?\n\nIn theory, the SHOP exchanges will offer small employers greater purchasing power and lower-cost insurance, because they can pool their risk. But news reports indicate that most of the small business exchanges aren\u2019t offering a choice of plans in 2014. Also, Politico notes, it\u2019s harder for small businesses to follow all the new rules than it is for large businesses, since they don\u2019t have big human resources departments.\n\nWhere can small business owners go for guidance on SHOP?\n\nThe Small Business Administration (SBA) and the advocacy group Small Business Majority are conducting weekly webinars for small business owners to learn the basics of the Affordable Care Act and SHOP. Visit SBA.gov/healthcare for details. A toll-free number is also available for questions on SHOP: 800-706-7893.\n\nAre there special provisions for companies with fewer than 25 employees?\n\nYes, in 2014 the health-care tax credit for companies with fewer than 25 employees will increase from 35 percent to 50 percent, as long as the company participates in SHOP.\n\nThe small business health-care tax credit is targeted at companies with low- and moderate-income workers. Businesses with fewer than 25 full-time-equivalent employees that pay average wages below $50,000 a year, and contribute toward at least half of employees\u2019 health-insurance premiums, qualify for the tax credit. IRS.gov provides information on how to calculate full-time-equivalent employees and average annual wages.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service also provides a Small Business Health Care Credit Estimator to help small companies find out if they\u2019re eligible for the tax credit.\n\nOther articles in the Monitor's Obamacare 101 series:\n\n\u2022 What happens starting Oct. 1?\n\n\u2022 What to know if you already have health insurance\n\n\u2022 How the federal subsidy works\n\n\u2022 What to know if you opt out of buying health insurance\n\n\u2022 When will the enrollment glitches be fixed?\n\n\u2022 What college students need to know\n\n\u2022 Seven ways you can sign up, despite Web woes\n\n\u2022 Enroll by March 31 to avoid penalty, White House clarifies", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "62004f1ea5e44421fb7c57558bd2b155", "sailthru.author": "Linda Feldmann", "description": "Obamacare includes a separate online health-insurance marketplace for small businesses, those with fewer than 50 employees.
