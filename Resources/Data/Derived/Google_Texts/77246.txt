One in. One out.

The Broncos produced the best wide receiving tandem in franchise history this season. But Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders wonâ€™t share their Pro Bowl experience.

Thomas will not participate because of ankle and toe injuries. He also is a pending free agent, a potential, if not udnderstandable factor in his decision.

The Philadelphia Eagles announced Friday that 26-year-old Jeremy Maclin will replace Thomas, granting him his first trip to the Pro Bowl. Maclin posted career-highs in catches (85), receiving yards (1,318) and tied a career-best in touchdown catches (10) in 2014.

Thomas was better.

He caught 111 passes for a franchise-best 1,619 yards and 11 touchdowns. He also established a Broncos record for 100-yards plus receiving games in a season with 10.

Thomas joins quarterback Peyton Manning as Broncos decilining to particiatipate because of injury. With the addition of Sanders last week, the Broncos have eight players scheduled to play in the Pro Bowl.
