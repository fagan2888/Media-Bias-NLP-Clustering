Some say Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul’s speeches can be a little dry.

Not if Paul’s New Hampshire political director David Chesley has anything to do with it.

At a Londonderry town hall Monday, he attempted to block a camera by licking its lens.

A 20-second video of the lickingwas first posted on YouTube by the progressive advocacy group American Bridge, which is one of many groups that employ so-called “trackers’’ to follow and film political candidates on the campaign trail.

“We prepare our trackers for all sorts of things,’’ said Ben Ray, American Bridge’s communications director. “This is the first time any of our cameras have gotten licked.’’

According to Ray, it was the same camera used by a tracker who kayaked after Scott Brown on the Contoocook River during his 2014 Senate campaign.

“I think it’s pretty gross,’’ said Ray, noting that the camera had been in the field since 2013.

The New Hampshire Democratic Party released a statement reminding Chesley, “thanks to the Affordable Care Act, he may be eligible for a free wellness check-up.’’

“Senator Rand Paul visited New Hampshire today to accept the endorsement of twenty New Hampshire State Representatives who support his run for the White House, and to visit with and take questions from the voters of NH,’’ said Paul campaign spokesman Sergio Gor, in a statement issued to multiplemediaoutlets.

“It was a great day of events,’’ said Gor.
