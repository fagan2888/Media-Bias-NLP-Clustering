All applicable large employers (ALE\u2014businesses who employ 50 or more full-time employees or full-time equivalents) received increased flexibility with a one-year extension from the normal filing date of March 31. Remember, this filing is to be performed on a new IRS process through the ACA Information Return system, also known as AIR. Prior registration is mandatory.\n\nPayroll Providers in the State of Oregon\u2014As of January 1, 2017, the employer\u2019s business registry number or business identification number must appear on all employee pay stubs. The Oregon Department of Revenue provides additional information.\n\nPaid Sick Leave Laws & Reminders\u2014Several states and localities now mandate paid sick leave, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, Oregon and California. Localities include San Francisco, Emeryville, Washington DC, Seattle, New York City, Oakland, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and New Jersey (specifically, Jersey City, Newark, Passaic, East Orange, Paterson, Irvington, Trenton, Montclair, Bloomfield and Elizabeth).\n\nIf you are providing payroll in Maryland (effective 10/1/2016) or Vermont (effective 1/1/2017) it is important to investigate how much paid sick leave employees will get and the impact if the employer already has a paid time off policy in place.\n\nNote that this is not a complete list, since several states and localities are adding mandatory sick leave on an ongoing basis. Thomson Reuters Checkpoint is a great resource for updates.\n\nState Minimum Wage News\u2014Most states increase minimum wages annually on January 1. However the following states have changes coming mid- to late 2016: California (San Francisco on 7/1/2016 and Berkeley on 10/1/2016), Maryland on 7/1/2016, Washington, D.C. on 7/1/2016, Minnesota on 8/1/2016 and Oregon on 7/1/2016. Keep an eye out for more!\n\nState Unemployment Insurance (UI) Rates\u2014New Jersey and Tennessee can change their UI base and rates on July 1, 2016.\n\nFUTA Deficit States\u2014As of now, there will only be two states and one territory with FUTA credit reduction for 2016: California, Ohio and the Virgin Islands. Final locations and percentages will be released later this year.

I look forward to seeing many readers in Nashville at the 34th Annual Congress.\n\n------------------\n\nJames Paille CPP is the Director of Operations for Thomson Reuters myPay Solutions.
