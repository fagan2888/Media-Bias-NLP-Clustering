But the across-the-board \u201csequester\u201d that took effect in March, when Republicans and Mr. Obama could not agree on alternative deficit reductions, has pared domestic and military programs further, resulting in increasing layoffs, furloughs and service cutbacks.\n\nRepublicans have supported keeping the sequestration cuts in place rather than accepting Mr. Obama\u2019s proposal for a mix of higher taxes on wealthy people and some corporations and cuts in future entitlement spending. And he has said he will not accept their alternative for deeper reductions in Medicare and Medicaid without tax increases.\n\nFederal spending for the major health programs and Social Security will equal 14 percent of the G.D.P. in 25 years, double the level of the last four decades, the budget office projected. While federal revenues are projected to grow \u2014 to 19.5 percent of the G.D.P. by 2038, compared with the 40-year average of 17.5 percent \u2014 that rise is not enough to offset the spending for federal benefit programs.\n\nIn contrast with entitlement spending, discretionary spending for domestic and military programs by 2023 would fall to 5.3 percent of the G.D.P., from the 7.3 percent of this year \u2014 the lowest levels in about 70 years.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cUnless substantial changes are made to the major health care programs and Social Security,\u201d the report said, \u201cthose programs will absorb a much larger share of the economy\u2019s total output in the future than they have in the past.\u201d\n\nNeither party expects any such changes this fall as the White House and Congress seek agreements to meet two deadlines: financing federal operations after the start of the fiscal year on Oct. 1 to avoid a government shutdown, and increasing the nation\u2019s borrowing limit to avert a default.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe budget office report emerged as House Republican leaders closed in on a decision on legislation that would finance the government through mid-December at the current levels, which reflect sequestration, and fully strip financing for the president\u2019s health care law.\n\nMichael Steel, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner, cautioned that \u201cno decisions have been made or will be made\u201d until House Republicans meet on Wednesday.\n\nBut aides familiar with the decision-making said House Republican leaders were ready to bow to the demands of rank-and-file conservatives and put \u201cdefunding\u201d the Affordable Care Act at the center of the coming fiscal showdown.\n\nWhile Republicans and Democrats continue to talk past one another, the opposing Senate leaders \u2014 the majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, and the minority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky \u2014 agreed that the first move was up to House leaders.\n\nMr. McConnell suggested that, like House Republicans, he would take a hard line on extracting deficit reduction concessions from Democrats before agreeing to raise the debt ceiling. But Democratic leaders reiterated that they would not negotiate on a matter that they say is Congress\u2019s responsibility: to cover the bills and pay the debts that it has already authorized.\n\n\u201cIt seems like the only time the president is ever willing to address the question of deficit and debt is when we have some opportunity and some leverage to bring him to the table,\u201d Mr. McConnell said, \u201cand a request to raise the debt ceiling is one of those opportunities.\u201d\n\nMr. Reid was equally dug in, especially against House Republicans\u2019 proposals to hold the government financing or debt limit measures hostage to their demands to delay or defund the health care law. He noted that Republicans had blinked before.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to holding the full faith and credit of the United States hostage,\u201d Mr. Reid said, \u201conly those with a loose grip on reality would expect a different result than we had last time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHouse Republican leadership aides say they still expect a vote this week or next on a proposal that would extend government financing at current levels, which reflect the sequestration cuts, and be linked to another measure to delay or defund the Affordable Care Act. But some conservatives are insisting that the attack on the health care law be part of the government financing bill, so that Democrats cannot ignore it.\n\nThat would force the Democratic-led Senate to vote to strip out the health law provision and send the financing measure back to the House. Then the Republican-led House would face a decision in the next two weeks: demand concessions on the health law and risk a shutdown, or pass a \u201cclean\u201d government financing bill largely with Democrats\u2019 votes.\n\nSome Senate Republicans are growing uneasy about the House\u2019s hard line. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said demanding that Mr. Obama undercut his own health care law \u201cis a bridge too far.\u201d He added: \u201cAt the end of the day, a shutdown, we own. Like it or not, we\u2019re going to own it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20130917123759, "twitter": {"description": "The nonpartisan office says that lawmakers are focused on the wrong kind of spending and that annual deficits will begin rising in 2016 as baby boomers age.", "title": "Budget Office Warns That Deficits Will Rise Again Because Cuts Are Misdirected", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/us/congressional-budget-office-predicts-unsustainable-debt.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002448230"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "calmesnyt", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/us/congressional-budget-office-predicts-unsustainable-debt.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002448230", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/us/congressional-budget-office-predicts-unsustainable-debt.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Budget Office Warns That Deficits Will Rise Again Because Cuts Are Misdirected", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 17, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "House of Representatives", "keywords": "Congressional Budget Office,Federal Budget (US),United States Politics and Government,National Debt (US),Senate,House of Representatives,Obama  Barack", "news_keywords": "Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jackie Calmes", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Obama, Barack", "byl": "By JACKIE CALMES", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The nonpartisan office says that lawmakers are focused on the wrong kind of spending and that annual deficits will begin rising in 2016 as baby boomers age.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "The nonpartisan office says that lawmakers are focused on the wrong kind of spending and that annual deficits will begin rising in 2016 as baby boomers age.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 17, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/jackie_calmes/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-08-07", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Obama, Barack", "published": "2013-09-17", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "slug": "18budget", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140807162855, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/us/congressional-budget-office-predicts-unsustainable-debt.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "The nonpartisan office says that lawmakers are focused on the wrong kind of spending and that annual deficits will begin rising in 2016 as baby boomers age.", "title": "Budget Office Warns That Deficits Will Rise Again Because Cuts Are Misdirected"}, "pdate": 20130917, "des": "National Debt (US)", "articleid": 100000002448230, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Budget Office Warns That Deficits Will Rise Again Because Cuts Are Misdirected", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaeb6\"", "article_summary": "Federal spending for the major health programs and Social Security will equal 14 percent of the G.D.P.\nMichael Steel, a spokesman for Speaker John A.
