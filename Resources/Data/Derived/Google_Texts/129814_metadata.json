But they tend to have a harder time getting their heads around the measures experts use to talk about the national health-cost problem, such as health spending as a percentage of gross domestic product, or the rate of increase in national health spending, or the difference in per capita health spending in the U.S. vs. other countries. In a focus group I attended, a participant was asked whether he believed the Affordable Care Act would \u201cbend the cost curve,\u201d a concept often used to discuss health spending and to sell the ACA. His response: \u201cI don\u2019t know about bending any curves, but I don\u2019t want to be bent.\u201d\n\nBut there is good news for those who want to understand more. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) has made a real contribution to making health spending more comprehensible by analyzing health spending and price growth by common diseases and diagnoses such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and even the common cold. Doing that makes the problem of health-care costs much more understandable for everyone, and it can help direct the attention of policymakers, health professionals, and health-care institutions to where health-care dollars are going.\n\nIn a very technical report, the BEA analyzed health spending by disease from 2000 to 2010, sorting diseases and diagnoses into categories. As shown by the chart above, which is adapted from BEA data, Americans spent the most\u2013$234 billion\u2013on circulatory diseases such as hypertension and heart disease in 2010. Next came general preventive care and general medical care for everyday problems such as the common cold or flu, at $207 billion. Musculoskeletal problems such back pain or arthritis came in third at $170 billion. Some prominent disease categories represented smaller shares of spending. For example, cancer represented 6.7% of spending, or $116 billion, and mental health conditions including dementia and depression accounted for 4.6% of spending, or $79 billion. A chart review of spending by disease is available here.\n\nThe BEA found that spending for common illnesses such as a cold or strep throat grew faster than anything else over the 10-year period. Then came spending to treat endocrine disorders such as high cholesterol or diabetes. The bureau also found that the cost of treatment\u2013a combination of price and the complexity of services and technology used in treatment\u2013was the main culprit behind spending increases for diseases, not the number of cases treated.\n\nMuch more could be done to fine-tune measures of spending by disease and, even more important, to assess the relative value of individuals\u2019 health spending. But everyone has a health problem or has a relative with a health problem or knows others who have health problems. Breaking down our health dollar by disease helps to make the problem of health costs and spending much more understandable.\n\nDrew Altman is president and chief executive officer of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
