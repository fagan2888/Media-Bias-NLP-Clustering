According to the latest from Gallup, President Obama's approval rating has plummeted into the 30s as millions of people continue to lose their health insurance.

Last week, an NBC/WSJ poll showed Obama's personal favorability and overall job approval were starting to take a nose dive, dropping eight points from the month before. It is also important to note this hit came before a barrage of insurance cancellation letters hit mailboxes.

Obama drops to new nadirs within this polling series on both overall job approval (42/51) and personal favorability (41/45, down from 47/41 in early October).

As the White House continues to deny lying about millions losing their health insurance after President Obama repeatedly promised for years that plans could be kept, we can expect this rapid downward trend to continue.
