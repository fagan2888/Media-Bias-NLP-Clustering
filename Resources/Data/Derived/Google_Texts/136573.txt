When they blather on about the rich paying their "fair share," they're talking about somebody else. You knew about Al Sharpton. You knew about Melissa Harris Perry. Here are two more, via National Review:





Touré Neblett, co-host of MSNBC’s The Cycle, owes more than $59,000 in taxes, according to public records reviewed by National Review. In September 2013, New York issued a state tax warrant to Neblett and his wife, Rita Nakouzi, for $46,862.68. Six months later, the state issued an additional warrant to the couple for $12,849.87...Last month, New York filed a $4,948.15 tax warrant against Joy-Ann Reid, who serves as managing editor of theGrio.com and until earlier this year hosted MSNBC’s The Reid Report, and her husband, Jason. Reid has called taxes on the wealthy “a basic fairness argument,” also arguing for “smart spending and smart tax increases” to create economic growth. NR could not reach Neblett or Reid directly, despite sending e-mails to them directly and asking for comment through an MSNBC spokesperson. Representatives for Neblett and Reid said their tax debts were in the process of being resolved.
