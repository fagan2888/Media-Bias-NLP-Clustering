Fullback Chris Swain ran 10 times for 58 yards.\n\nBryant Shirreffs threw for 219 yards and two scores for UConn (2-2, 0-1 American). Freshman receiver Tyraiq Beals caught six passes for 63 yards and a touchdown for the Huskies.\n\nShirreffs connected with tight end Tommy Myers on a six-yard touchdown pass, and a successful two-point conversion made it a 10-point game with just over seven minutes left. The Huskies recovered the onside kick, but turned the ball over on downs, ending a comeback threat.\n\nReynolds has rushed for 3,491 yards and is now second on Navy\u2019s all-time rushing list behind former running back Napoleon McCallum, who ran for 4,179 yards from 1981 through 1985.\n\nReynolds had 93 rushing yards by halftime after leading Navy to touchdowns on each of its three first-half possessions.\n\nHis 10-yard touchdown run capped Navy\u2019s opening 62-yard drive. The Midshipmen went 85 yards on their second, and led 14-3 when Tillman out-jumped UConn\u2019s Jamar Summers in the end zone. That was the 24th touchdown pass of Reynolds\u2019 career, and it occurred on his second pass attempt of the game.\n\nReynolds also scored on a four-yard run with two seconds remaining in the half, capping a 14-play drive.\n\nHis 10-yard touchdown run in the third quarter made it 28-10 and moved him past Texas running back Ricky Williams on the all-time list.\n\nUConn moved the ball, putting up 325 yards of offense, including 186 in the first half.\n\nThe Huskies had to settle for a 38-yard field goal on their opening drive. They decided to pass up a 31-yard attempt on their second possession and were left with no points after Shirreffs missed a wide-open Max DeLorenzo on fourth down.\n\nBeals later got behind the Navy defense and caught a 39-yard touchdown pass from Shirreffs to cut the Navy lead to 14-10.\n\nUConn\u2019s defense entered the game ranked 18th in the nation and had been giving up 126 yards a game on the ground. Navy had 190 yards rushing by halftime.\n\nNavy converted its first seven third-down attempts. The team\u2019s first punt, midway through the third quarter, pinned the Huskies inside the one-yard line.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Reynolds ran for three touchdowns, scoring twice from 10 yards out and tacking on a four-yard run, as the Midshipmen easily handled UConn, 28-18, in their first conference road game.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Reynolds ran for three touchdowns, scoring twice from 10 yards out and tacking on a four-yard run, as the Midshipmen easily handled UConn, 28-18, in their first conference road game.", "title": "Keenan Reynolds now No. 2 in NCAA rushing touchdowns as Navy tops UConn", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/26/keenan-reynolds-navy-rushing-touchdowns-uconn/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/26/AP_717832246888.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/26/AP_717832246888.jpg", "description": "Reynolds ran for three touchdowns, scoring twice from 10 yards out and tacking on a four-yard run, as the Midshipmen easily handled UConn, 28-18, in their first conference road game.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Keenan Reynolds now No. 2 in NCAA rushing touchdowns as Navy tops UCon"}, "Author": "Pat Eaton-Robb", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Navy"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd43e\"", "article_summary": "That was the 24th touchdown pass of Reynolds\u2019 career, and it occurred on his second pass attempt of the game.\nReynolds had 93 rushing yards by halftime after leading Navy to touchdowns on each of its three first-half possessions.\nBeals later got behind the Navy defense and caught a 39-yard touchdown pass from Shirreffs to cut the Navy lead to 14-10.\nNavy had 190 yards rushing by halftime.\nShirreffs connected with tight end Tommy Myers on a six-yard touchdown pass, and a successful two-point conversion made it a 10-point game with just over seven minutes left."}
