Unfortunately, a recent decision by the state's largest insurance provider would hurt New Jersey patients and undermine the ability of Catholic health-care facilities to care for our state's most poor and vulnerable populations.\n\nHorizon Blue Cross Blue Shield's decision to exclude more than half of New Jersey's hospitals \u2014 and nearly 90 percent of Catholic hospitals \u2014 from its new OMNIA Health Alliance is unacceptable and will have a devastating impact on our state's health-care system. One insurance company should not be able to dictate which hospitals succeed and which ones fail. However, that is exactly what Horizon is doing with its plan to designate Catholic hospitals as second-tier facilities.\n\nFor nearly 150 years, the Catholic ministry has been a vibrant member of New Jersey's health-care community, providing accessible and cost-effective health care to more than 2.5 million children, women and men each year. Many of these hospitals already operate on very thin financial margins and serve a large population of the state's uninsured residents. The financial fallout from Horizon's decision could force a number of Catholic hospitals to close their doors, resulting in the loss of access to health care for our state's poor and uninsured citizens.\n\nThe hospitals excluded from Horizon's \"Tier 1\" alliance currently deliver tens of millions of dollars in care to tens of thousands of neighbors who need help but can't afford to pay. The financial stability required to care for the poor is threatened by Horizon's new network, which will force many Horizon members to receive care outside of their community. The most devastating results would occur in some of our most urban areas.\n\nAt a time when our state is trying to reign in out-of-network costs, Horizon's plan will lead to staggering, unpredicted out-of-network bills for many patients. Horizon's own members will be financially penalized for accessing care from their local hospital of choice, and the complex tiered system will cause confusion for patients that ultimately leads to higher medical bills. Expectant mothers receiving maternal care, for example, would be forced to pay exorbitant out-of-network rates to stay with their trusted local obstetricians and hospitals.\n\n\n\nHorizon's new plan leaves large gaps in access to affordable care in several regions of the state. Excluding St. Francis Medical Center and Capital Health in Trenton, for example, means there will be no Tier 1 hospitals in the state's capital city. With the exclusion of Lourdes Medical Center of Burlington County, some Horizon members living and working in Burlington County could be forced to drive over an hour to access affordable care. There is no Tier 1 hospital in Elizabeth, the state's fourth largest city, since Trinitas Regional Medical Center was excluded. In New Brunswick, the exclusion of Saint Peter's Healthcare System means women and children in the region will lose highly-specialized pediatrics and neonatal care.\n\nPerhaps the most disturbing aspect of Horizon's plan has been the company's complete lack of transparency in determining the criteria for their new hospital network. Clearly, quality of care and affordability did not play a role, as many of the Tier 2 providers far exceed Tier 1 providers in those categories. The company did not choose the safest hospitals in the state based on the highly-regarded Leapfrog scores, as only 33 percent of Horizon Tier 1 hospitals received an \"A\" from the Leapfrog Group, compared to 59 percent of Tier 2 hospitals.\n\nCatholic hospitals consistently out-perform many other New Jersey hospitals on affordability and quality scores, being some of the most efficient, high-quality providers in the state. Yet, the majority of these health-care facilities were excluded from the OMNIA plan. Both Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck and Lourdes Medical Center have made a tangible commitment to transition to a value-based system by participating in Horizon's Accountable Care Organization. In fact, Holy Name performed so well on Horizon's own metrics that they too received an incentive reimbursement.\n\nIn the end, not only did Horizon deliberately exclude Catholic hospitals, but they have chosen some of the most expensive hospitals in New Jersey which will cost their customers even more.\n\nThe Catholic Healthcare Partnership of New Jersey believes all Horizon members deserve the right to receive care from the hospitals and doctors of their choice. Horizon must not be permitted to proceed until the full impact of their decisions are considered by state regulators and lawmakers.\n\nSister Patricia Codey, SC, Esq., is president of the Catholic HealthCare Partnership of New Jersey, which represents acute hospitals and other faith-based health-care facilities in New Jersey.\n\nFollow The Star-Ledger on Twitter @starledger.
