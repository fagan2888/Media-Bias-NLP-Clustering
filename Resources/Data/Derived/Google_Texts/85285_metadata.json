State and local Medicaid expenditures and employee-related costs both grow faster than the gross domestic product, the GAO said. It estimated health-related costs will grow from about 3.9 percent of GDP this year to 7.4 percent by 2060.\n\n(READ THE FULL REPORT)\n\nBy that year, health-related costs will make up a greater proportion of state and local government expenditures than non-health-related costs, like wages and salaries.\n\n\n\nSource: Government Accountability Office\n\n\u201c[S]tate and local governments face long-term fiscal pressures,\u201d the GAO said in a statement accompanying the release, a bureaucratic understatement of epic proportions. \u201cAbsent any policy changes, the sector will face an increasing gap between expenditures and receipts in future years.\u201d\n\nGovernment pension assets have increased in value over the last year, but liabilities are growing at a faster pace, a sign of long-term trouble.\n\nBob Williams, a public policy analyst who runs the independent State Budget Solutions, said the GAO\u2019s reports have forecast the same long-term shortfall since it was first released in 2007. But making the changes that bolster a state\u2019s long-term health, at the short-term expense of taxpayers or beneficiaries of programs that would need to be cut, isn\u2019t in a policymaker\u2019s immediate interests.\n\n\u201cThe major problem is that governors and legislators have a very short-term vision: Don\u2019t rock the boat and don\u2019t do anything that hurts their re-election chances. It is so much easier to kick the can forward than to take what is needed \u2014 raise taxes [and] cut spending or do a combination of both,\u201d Williams said.\n\nEven if legislatures and governors were to take action, they would need to implement draconian cuts and tax increases to close the gap. The GAO estimated state and local governments would have to reduce expenditures or raise revenue by a combined 18 percent \u2014 and likely more: The GAO\u2019s models assume no economic impacts from spending cuts or tax hikes.\n\n\n\nSpending levels as a percentage of GDP required to close the fiscal gap. Source: Government Accountability Office\n\nAt present levels, tax receipts won\u2019t grow nearly as fast as health-related costs. Property tax receipts are expected to increase from 2.7 percent of GDP to 2.8 percent over 50 years, which would still leave governments short of the 3 percent historical high reached in 2009. Sales tax receipts are expected to decline gradually as a percentage of GDP.\n\nThe GAO still says it cannot predict the impact of the Affordable Care Act on state budgets, given the different paths states are taking towards implementation. Some states have accepted federal money to expand Medicaid, though that federal money will decline over time. Others have refused to expand Medicaid. Further complicating the picture, government economists still don\u2019t know how the controversial law will affect the growth of health care costs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Legislatures and governors would have to implement massive tax increases and spending cuts just to tread water, the government watchdog found.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Legislatures and governors would have to implement massive tax increases and spending cuts just to tread water, the government watchdog found.", "title": "GAO: Without draconian cuts, states face decades-long fiscal crisis", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/12/22/gao-without-draconian-cuts-states-face-decades-long-fiscal-crisis/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/files/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-22-at-2.21.45-PM.png&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@postreid"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/12/22/gao-without-draconian-cuts-states-face-decades-long-fiscal-crisis/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "states, budget, recession, fiscal crisis", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "states, budget, recession, fiscal crisis"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd027a\"", "article_summary": "It estimated health-related costs will grow from about 3.9 percent of GDP this year to 7.4 percent by 2060.\nSource: Government Accountability Office\u201c[S]tate and local governments face long-term fiscal pressures,\u201d the GAO said in a statement accompanying the release, a bureaucratic understatement of epic proportions.\nSource: Government Accountability OfficeAt present levels, tax receipts won\u2019t grow nearly as fast as health-related costs.\nSales tax receipts are expected to decline gradually as a percentage of GDP.\nAt the same time, rising health-related costs borne by state and local governments, especially those incurred by government employees and retirees, are putting pressure on state budgets."}
