The Director for Avenue H Patty Conner says she received word last week that UnitedHealthcare of Utah will no longer be offering plans on the exchange as of 2017. Conner says the HMO had some of the lower priced plans in the market, so it\u2019s unfortunate for consumers.\n\n\u201cI do think it will for the short-term impact the competition, but we don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to be participating in 2017 and what that might do for the rates,\u201d Conner says.\n\nThere are more than 15,000 Utahns insured through the small business exchange. Only 200 of those have plans from United Healthcare of Utah. The other companies currently offering plans are SelectHealth and HSA Health Plan. The nonprofit Arches Health Plan dropped out of the market this year. The Utah Insurance Department put Arches in receivership after it determined that the cooperative didn\u2019t have the funding to pay claims. Conner says we can expect this kind of volatility to continue as insurance companies adjust to changes in the market and requirements of federal healthcare policy.\n\n\u201cThe message to the consumers is \u2013 have faith. This will definitely right itself before too long,\u201d Conner says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to get the risk adjustment and all of the costs and premiums sorted out, but it does take some time and some experience when you put a new program together to figure out what are the right levers to push and pull.\u201d\n\nConner says she\u2019ll have a better picture of how the market is shaping up come September when insurance companies submit their proposed rates.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health Care", "description": "The CEO of UnitedHealthcare, the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, said this week that the company is planning a widespread exodus from the Obamacare", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://kuer.org/post/health-insurer-drops-out-utah-s-small-business-exchange", "type": "article", "description": "The CEO of UnitedHealthcare, the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, said this week that the company is planning a widespread exodus from the Obamacare", "title": "Health Insurer Drops Out of Utah\u2019s Small Business Exchange"}, "story_id": 475337790, "twitter": {"site": "@KUERNews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@KUERNews"}, "author": "Andrea Smardon", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Health Insurer Drops Out of Utah\u2019s Small Business Exchange"}, "nid": 76903, "datePublished": "2016-04-22", "keywords": "health insurance exchange, Avenue H, UnitedHealthcare, Arches Health Plan", "wordCount": 337, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The Utah Insurance Department put Arches in receivership after it determined that the cooperative didn\u2019t have the funding to pay claims.\nThe other companies currently offering plans are SelectHealth and HSA Health Plan.\nThere are more than 15,000 Utahns insured through the small business exchange.\nThe CEO of UnitedHealthcare, the nation\u2019s largest health insurer, said this week that the company is planning a widespread exodus from the Obamacare market due to financial losses.\nConner says the HMO had some of the lower priced plans in the market, so it\u2019s unfortunate for consumers."}
