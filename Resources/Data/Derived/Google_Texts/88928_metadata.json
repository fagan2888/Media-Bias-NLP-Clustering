They have fallen into the looking glass and lost their way, intent on a world that never is and shall never be.\n\nRush Limbaugh epitomizes the Republican loss of being as \u201cthe top media voice for political conservatives,\u201d according to World Net Daily. I don\u2019t know if he is the top media voice, but how do you grade degrees of appalling? I\u2019m willing, for the sake of argument, to accept WND\u2019s judgment on this. After all, if anybody ought to know appalling, it is WND.\n\nWhat is weird is that Limbaugh said Monday there is something weird going on, that the GOP has somehow become liberal:\n\nWe are all inundated by each other, every day, with e-mails, phone calls, texts, what have you, of utter incredulity over what\u2019s happened to the Republican Party. It\u2019s just too weird, folks, there just isn\u2019t any serious opposition to anything that the Democrat Party wants.\n\nRiiiiight\u2026.\n\nNope. No opposition at all.\n\nIt is clear that Limbaugh is addressing some bizarre reality on a world none of the rest of us can see, a sort of inner, inner layer to the Fox News bubble.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not even going through the motions. They\u2019re not even voicing phony opposition to Obama in order to placate the base. They\u2019re actively targeting their own base. This is just too weird!\u201d\n\nIt would be weird. If it were true. But Limbaugh insists the Planned Parenthood video, in its entirety a hoax, is true: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing that was taken out of context here.\u201d\n\nHe insists what Huckabee said about Obama leading Jews to the oven door is true, even though Jews say it is not and are horrified by the suggestion.\n\nHe said Trump never said what he clearly said about McCain, what you can hear Trump saying about McCain every single time you watch the video.\n\nLimbaugh is not the first to try to cope with the paradoxes of the conservative multi-verse. We all remember Glenn Beck asking, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t anyone talking about this?\u201d when something popped into his head \u2013 usually something he invented.\n\nHeck, Republicans even want to pass legislation on the lie they made up about Planned Parenthood.\n\nAfter almost seven years of Republican-imposed gridlock, shut-down, and nullification, this is Limbaugh\u2019s analysis of the state of the Republican Party:\n\nBut just the establishment in Washington, you can\u2019t distinguish the difference between Republicans and Democrats there. They are all aligned. They are glued together. But the difference now is, the Republican Party doesn\u2019t even go through the motions of trying to convince its voters that they\u2019re opposed to the Obama agenda.\n\nNo, Rush is not living in our universe, and he is not alone.\n\nThe long night of the Republican Party is upon them, the consequences of going on two decades of binge drinking their own Kool Aid. The necessity that what they wish to be true, BE true.\n\nThe entire foundation of their constructed reality, its underpinnings, are fantasy. It follows that everything which proceeds from these fantasies must also be fantasies. But because all this must, according to their ideology, be true, they are left befuddled and dismayed.\n\nOne of these false assumptions is that the House could ever repeal the Affordable Care Act, as though it were just another bill up for a vote and not the law of the land. Twice upheld by the Supreme Court, no less. Another is immigration. Yet another, Iran. On all three, Republicans have found themselves stymied by a reality that refuses to cooperate with their preconceptions:\n\nI mean, they\u2019ve had all these phony votes. For example, repeal Obamacare votes,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey\u2019re not even going through the motions of that \u2019cause they know that people see through it and that they don\u2019t mean it. They\u2019re not even trying. I don\u2019t care what the issue is. The big three: Amnesty, Obamacare, Iran. Nothing! Zilch! No opposition to anything. Now, can anybody say that immigration, as being policed or not policed by Obama is helping America? Can anybody? They don\u2019t even try to make the case that\u2019s happening. I mean, even the amnesty supporters do not do it on the basis that it\u2019s good for America.\n\nNever mind that studies show immigration makes the United States stronger. That there is no evidence that the flood of immigrants are like a wave of barbarians crashing against the frontiers of the new Roman Empire. His despair is evident:\n\nThey do it on the basis that it\u2019s \u2018fair; for the immigrants. They do it on the basis of social justice and fairness motivations and reasons. But they don\u2019t do it it\u2019s improving the country. The Iran deal. Does anybody think this is actually good for the United States? Yet there\u2019s no opposition to it, no serious opposition. Can anybody say that Obamacare is making health care better? Can anybody say that anything that Obama is doing is? Nobody even makes the case, other than Obama with some words now and then \u2026 that the country\u2019s better off than it has been. They have to lie about employment numbers, they have to make things up. There\u2019s not even any fake opposition to Obama.\n\nCognitive dissonance requires that Limbaugh find some other explanation for the unacceptable. In his mind, therefore, \u201cIt\u2019s because the Republican Party wants to finally get rid of the conservatives, get rid of its base.\u201d\n\nOh dear. The water has gotten deep, but that is only because Rush is laying first down in the very thin veneer of what passes for rational thinking in the GOP.\n\nAnd Senate Majority Leader McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner? Why, \u201cThey have turned to mush.\u201d\n\nThere is a void in Republican leadership then, and Trump has filled it. Limbaugh\u2019s conclusion followed from his premise, and would seem sound were it not that the premise was a flight of fantasy:\n\nAdmit it, folks. What has you bamboozled, what has you frustrated is you don\u2019t see any opposition to any of it at a level of power that could do something about stopping it. There\u2019s plenty of opposition in your neighborhood, plenty of opposition in your town, plenty of opposition in your family, plenty of opposition in your friends, but there\u2019s none where it counts.\n\nHe\u2019s right at last. There has been a whole lotta bamboozling going on and conservatives have willingly submitted to it, and in fact, crave more. Joining our shared reality at this late date won\u2019t fix their shattered fantasies at this point. Only more lies will serve.\n\nAnd so Rush Limbaugh\u2019s long nightmare will continue.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When you start with a false premise, and add more false premises to the first, well...Limbaugh thinks Republicans have turned into Democrats", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "When you start with a false premise, and add more false premises to the first, well...Limbaugh thinks Republicans have turned into Democrats", "title": "Rush Limbaugh's Carefully Constructed World of Lies Comes Crashing Down", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/07/28/rush-limbaugh-world-lies-crashing-down.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ush-limbaugh-hands.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-28T16:51:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Republican Party,Fox News Reality Bubble,Rush Limbaugh,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2015-07-28T16:51:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-28T16:51:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Fox News Reality Bubble, Republican Party, Rush Limbaugh"}, "article_summary": "In his mind, therefore, \u201cIt\u2019s because the Republican Party wants to finally get rid of the conservatives, get rid of its base.\u201dOh dear.\nThe long night of the Republican Party is upon them, the consequences of going on two decades of binge drinking their own Kool Aid.\nRush Limbaugh epitomizes the Republican loss of being as \u201cthe top media voice for political conservatives,\u201d according to World Net Daily.\nAt the best of times, the Republican Party has seemed dissociated from our shared reality, unmoored from the currents of our day to day existence on this planet.\nThey\u2019re not even voicing phony opposition to Obama in order to placate the base."}
