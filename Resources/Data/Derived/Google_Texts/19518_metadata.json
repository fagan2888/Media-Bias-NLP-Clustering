Tom Corbett and Kane negotiated this summer.\n\nA separate letter to UPMC cautioned it against suing Highmark, saying the state officials have \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over enforcement of the consent decrees.\n\nThe letters scolded Highmark and UPMC for continuing to fight over issues such as UPMC doctors that Highmark members will be able to consult, and the rates UPMC charges Highmark for cancer care.\n\n\u201cYour continued discord has now resulted in us having to take legal action that will likely only heighten consumer confusion and alarm,\u201d the letters state. \u201cOur collective expectation is that both parties will stop trying to out-maneuver one another and instead work together to fulfill both the letter and spirit of the consent decrees.\u201d\n\nA zero premium Highmark Community Blue Medicare HMO plan introduced last week prompted the state response. The plan excludes UPMC hospitals and doctors in Western Pennsylvania as in-network providers.\n\nHighmark advertised the plan as a low-cost alternative to its traditional, broad-network Medicare Advantage products for seniors, which are rising in price.\n\nHighmark spokesman David Carter said the insurer needs to be able to offer competitive products.\n\n\u201cThe burden is on the state to explain to seniors why this company can't sell a zero premium product and others can,\u201d Carter said.\n\nHe said UPMC Health Plan sells Medicare Advantage plans that exclude Allegheny Health Network, the hospitals Highmark owns.\n\nUPMC spokesman Paul Wood said the state is taking the right action to ensure that seniors \u201cwill have full in-network access to UPMC, regardless of the Highmark Medicare product they choose.\u201d\n\nIn consent decrees that Highmark and UPMC officials signed in June, the health care giants agreed that senior citizens are a \u201cvulnerable population\u201d who would keep full in-network access to UPMC.\n\nEmployer groups and individuals with Highmark coverage will lose access to most UPMC hospitals in Pittsburgh on Jan. 1.\n\nKane spokesman J.J. Abbott did not respond to requests for comment. The Department of Health referred questions to the Department of Insurance.\n\n\u201cWe have a long-standing commitment from both parties that vulnerable populations need the most protection and would not be impacted,\u201d said Melissa Fox, an Insurance Department spokeswoman. \u201cBecause this may be subject to litigation, we can't provide further comment at this point.\u201d\n\nHighmark is raising prices on its broad-network Freedom Blue and Security Blue Medicare Advantage plans. To offer lower-priced insurance products, it is restricting access to hospitals and doctors with narrow networks, such as Community Blue.\n\nAlex Nixon is a Trib Total Media staff writer.
