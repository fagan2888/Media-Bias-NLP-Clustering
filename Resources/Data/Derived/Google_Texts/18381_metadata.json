Minnesota is the only other state that permits it.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of the Heartland argued that the Iowa medical board\u2019s rule \u201ccut off\u201d women in rural and medically underserved areas from access to safe, legal abortions.\n\nThe abortion provider also said its \u201ctelehealth\u201d protocols have been shown to be just as safe and effective as its in-person protocols.\n\nWomen receiving telehealth at a health center are counseled and personally examined by medical professionals; those professionals are also present when women speak with the abortion doctors via webcam or other video technology.\n\nThen, when a woman takes the first of two abortion pills, she does so while the doctor watches her remotely, Planned Parenthood said.\n\nMedication abortions \u2014 which involve RU-486, the abortion pill, and a second pill, misoprostol or Cytotec \u2014 are used to end pregnancies that are up to seven weeks, and they are sometimes used on pregnancies as old as nine weeks.\n\nTroy Newman, president of the pro-life group Operation Rescue, said the Iowa Supreme Court\u2019s ruling was \u201cunconscionable.\u201d\n\nMedication abortions have \u201ca failure rate of 45-79 per 1,000 women,\u201d Mr. Newman said, citing the Food and Drug Administration. Claims that such abortions don\u2019t have complications \u201chave no credibility whatsoever,\u201d he said.\n\nSome 19 states ban webcam abortions, said Operation Rescue, which actively worked to get webcam abortions blocked in Iowa.\n\nAbortion providers \u201cmust be held to basic medical standards of care,\u201d said Natalie Decker, legal counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF).\n\nADF had urged the Iowa Supreme Court to uphold the telemedicine rule on behalf of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists; Donna J. Harrison, M.D.; Iowa Right to Life; and Susan Thayer, a former director of an Iowa Planned Parenthood facility who resigned her position rather than perform \u201cwebcam\u201d abortions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Iowa rule blocking \"webcam\" abortions has been struck down as unconstitutional by the state's highest court.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "An Iowa rule blocking \u201cwebcam\u201d abortions has been struck down as unconstitutional by the state\u2019s highest court.", "title": "Iowa court clears way for telemedicine abortions", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/19/iowa-court-clears-way-for-telemedicine-abortion/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/19/AP100922080112.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/19/AP100922080112.jpg", "description": "An Iowa rule blocking \"webcam\" abortions has been struck down as unconstitutional by the state's highest court.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Iowa court clears way for telemedicine abortions"}, "Author": "Cheryl Wetzstein", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Iowa Supreme Court"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca63b\"", "article_summary": "Some 19 states ban webcam abortions, said Operation Rescue, which actively worked to get webcam abortions blocked in Iowa.\nAn Iowa rule blocking \u201cwebcam\u201d abortions has been struck down as unconstitutional by the state\u2019s highest court.\nIowa is the first state to have used telemedicine for abortions; about 7,000 webcam abortions have been done in urban Iowa centers since 2008, said the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\n; Iowa Right to Life; and Susan Thayer, a former director of an Iowa Planned Parenthood facility who resigned her position rather than perform \u201cwebcam\u201d abortions.\nADF had urged the Iowa Supreme Court to uphold the telemedicine rule on behalf of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists; Donna J.
