In the accountability system\u2019s first year, a school had to score 85-100 points to get an A, 70-84 points to get a B, and so on.\n\nWith 2014-15 data, schools would have had to score 90-100 points to get an A, 80-89 points to get a B, etc according to current law. The switch would mean many schools would drop a letter grade\u2014even if they had been making good academic progress with their students. Today\u2019s passage of HB 358 will delay that switch for two years.\n\nThe bill does not fix the more contentious part of the A-F school grading model, an accountability system that is the brain child of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. That issue is the formula for how the A-F grades are calculated for schools.\n\nCurrently, 80 percent of a school\u2019s grade is based on how well its students perform on standardized tests on a given day, referred to as \u2018achievement.\u2019 Twenty percent of the grade is based on how well students \u201cgrow\u201d over time \u2013 whether or not their test scores improve year to year, which many education advocates say is a better measure of how well a school is doing to educate kids.\n\nSenator Josh Stein attempted to amend HB 358 on the Senate floor on Thursday to change the A-F school grading formula to 50 percent achievement, 50 percent growth \u2013 but his amendment was tabled by fellow lawmakers.\n\n\u201cAchievement is entirely correlated to income,\u201d said Stein. \u201cSchools do well when they come from a well to do community\u2026growth is not correlated to income. Kids learn from wherever they are, whether they are poor or whether they are rich\u2014if they are taught well.\u201d\n\nWhen the A-F school grades were first released in February, proponents hailed the accountability system as a way for parents to finally know just how well their schools were doing to educate their children.\n\nBut critics of the system quickly noted that nearly all of the schools receiving Ds and Fs were those serving high poverty communities. Schools receiving As and Bs were largely serving more affluent communities. The measure, critics say, is too simple\u2013it fails to sufficiently account for the academic growth that good schools help students achieve and does not take into consideration the challenges that schools serving a high number of poor students face.\n\n\u201cThe only thing these grades tell us is where our poor children go to school and where our rich children go to school,\u201d said Lynn Shoemaker, a 23 year veteran public school teacher.\n\nMany schools that received Ds and Fs were making progress with students on a year to year basis.\n\n\u201cEighty-six schools got a D or F that met or exceeded their growth expectations,\u201d said Senator Stein as he introduced his amendment. \u201cTo consider those schools a failure\u2026is absolutely antithetical to what they are. We should be standing up and applauding those schools.\u201d Instead, said Stein, parents are abandoning the very schools that are helping their kids, thanks to the low grades.\n\nConversely, Stein noted that there are 45 A or B schools that did not meet growth.\n\n\u201cThese are schools that we are giving As and Bs and saying to the parents \u2018you\u2019re kids are at a good school\u2019 even though that school is not educating those children.\u201d\n\nSenator Apodaca encouraged his colleagues to table Senator Stein\u2019s motion to tweak the A-F school grading formula, saying he hasn\u2019t heard any complaints from parents in the mountains\u2014only thank yous. He has heard complaints from some principals and administrators who don\u2019t like A-F school grades, however.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to think if I\u2019ve heard any [complaints],\u201d said Sen. Apodaca. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ve heard some because some people don\u2019t like Santa Claus.\u201d\n\nThere is another bill that has passed the House that would tweak the formula just as Senator Stein has suggested, making A-F school grades based on 50 percent achievement, 50 percent growth.\n\nBut Senators have referred that bill, HB 803, to the Ways and Means committee, where bills typically go to die.\n\nToday\u2019s legislation that adjusts the A-F school grading scale now awaits Gov. Pat McCrory\u2019s signature.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd156c\"", "article_summary": "Today\u2019s legislation that adjusts the A-F school grading scale now awaits Gov.\nHe has heard complaints from some principals and administrators who don\u2019t like A-F school grades, however.\nThe bill does not fix the more contentious part of the A-F school grading model, an accountability system that is the brain child of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.\nThat issue is the formula for how the A-F grades are calculated for schools.\nThe switch would mean many schools would drop a letter grade\u2014even if they had been making good academic progress with their students."}
