That neoliberal capitalism is consistent with liberal democracy. That there is no alternative.\n\nA little over 30 years ago, before most of us millennials were born, President Ronald Reagan prophesied that what alternatives there were would be consigned to the \u201cash-heap of history\u201d by the \u201cmarch of freedom and democracy.\u201d With the fall of the Berlin Wall, global capitalism would emerge triumphant, presaging, in the immortal words of Francis Fukuyama, \u201cthe end of history as such: that is\u2026the universalization of Western liberal democracy.\u201d\n\nFour years ago this month, the partisans of freedom and democracy were on the march once more, from the streets of Cairo to the Wisconsin state capitol. Within months, youthful protesters would occupy the squares of a thousand cities, demanding \u201creal democracy now\u201d and declaring an end to the end of history. The occupations would become focal points for an emerging opposition to the politics of austerity and restricted democracy.\n\nAs it happened, it was not the Communist Party, but the Tea Party and the party of Wall Street that would stand in their way. Reagan\u2019s logic, it seemed, had been turned on its head. Capitalism no longer stood for democracy. On the contrary, capital could not stand democracy.\n\nFrom the financial crisis of 2008 to the present era of political paralysis, the path to democratic reform has been blocked at every turn. Between Wall Street and Washington, Congress and the courts, statehouses and city halls, the will of the many has been subordinated to the will of the few (as it has been, sadly, for much of our history as a nation).\n\nAs study after study has shown, politicians are far more attuned to the whims of the wealthy than they are to the will of the other 99 percent. A recent analysis of 1,779 policy outcomes by two leading political scientists found that, in the United States today, \u201cthe majority does not rule,\u201d and that, \u201cwhen a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites\u2026they generally lose,\u201d causing the authors to question the claim that ours is a democratic society.\n\nThe class bias of American politics has not only cost us our democracy. It has also cost us our jobs, our health and our security. For years, the recovery was crippled by the politics of austerity, as a bipartisan coalition took a butcher\u2019s knife to the public sector, and as balanced budgets took precedence over basic needs. The public option was taken off the table before the public even had a chance to debate it. Financial reform was gutted, then gutted again by unreformed bankers, together with their armies of lobbyists and their allies in the legislature.\n\nParticipation in the political process has been increasingly restricted to those with the means to participate, namely, money, time and a photo ID. Given the constraints\u2014and the disconnect between electoral politics and people\u2019s everyday lives\u2014it should come as no surprise that we have seen seven years of declining voter participation. Nor should it come as a surprise that the decline has been disproportionately concentrated among the young, the non-wealthy and the non-white.\n\nMeanwhile, the organizations that used to represent ordinary people\u2014unions\u2014have beaten a retreat in the face of the business offensive. Union membership has plummeted to its lowest level in 70 years, leaving workers unrepresented and corporate power unchecked. Fewer than one in nine Americans are in a union, even though more than half of them say they would join one if they could. There is no more telling statistic about the democratic deficit in this country.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Money is speech, dollars have more influence than people -- it's time to be honest about the plutocracy we live in", "author": "Michael Gould-Wartofsky", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Money is speech, dollars have more influence than people -- it's time to be honest about the plutocracy we live in", "title": "This is not a democracy: How the 1 percent rigged the game", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/01/this_is_not_a_democracy_how_the_1_percent_rigged_the_game/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/rolls_royce_1percent.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Money is speech, dollars have more influence than people -- it's time to be honest about the plutocracy we live in", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/rolls_royce_1percent.jpg", "title": "This is not a democracy: How the 1 percent rigged the game", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "This is not a democracy: How the 1 percent rigged the game", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, #blacklivesmatter, 1 percent, Bernie Sanders, Editor's Picks, Elizabeth Warren, Occupy Wall Street, Ronald Reagan, Tea Party, Unions", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff43\"", "article_summary": "Within months, youthful protesters would occupy the squares of a thousand cities, demanding \u201creal democracy now\u201d and declaring an end to the end of history.\nAs it happened, it was not the Communist Party, but the Tea Party and the party of Wall Street that would stand in their way.\nThe occupations would become focal points for an emerging opposition to the politics of austerity and restricted democracy.\nThe class bias of American politics has not only cost us our democracy.\nThat neoliberal capitalism is consistent with liberal democracy."}
