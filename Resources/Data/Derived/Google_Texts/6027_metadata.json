It was a beautiful day, the sun was shining, lots of people were out jogging, biking, or taking leisurely strolls. I was greeted with many jovial \u201cmorning, ma\u2019am!\u201ds. I might have whistled the tune to \u201cZip-ah-dee-doo-dah\u201d at one point. It was a perfect morning. And then I turned a corner and came face to face with a guy wearing a giant yellow raincoat, with a battered snow shovel propped up on his shoulder. He shuffled by me, glaring and muttering. The only thing that ran through my head, once I was reasonably sure he wasn\u2019t going to murder me, was, \u201cBuddy, you need to check your vibes.\u201d Just a quick vibe check in the morning before heading out the door \u2014 a glance in the mirror, a second thought about accessorizing with a weirdly threatening snow shovel on a sunny day in May \u2014 could have vastly improved the situation. But hey, it\u2019s not just this guy; we could all use a vibe check every once in awhile. Here are 12 signs you might need to check yours:\n\n1. Are you talking on your phone SUPER loudly in a relatively quiet public place? Does your conversation have to do with medical test results and/or a weird thing that happened during sex last night and/or a fight you had with your mom? Check your vibes.\n\n2. Are you wearing a bedpan as a hat? Check your vibes.\n\n3. Are you about to push \u201csubmit\u201d on an internet comment that says, \u201cDats fuckin gaaaaay\u201d? Check your vibes.\n\n4. Are you raising your hand in class to tell a reeeeaaallly long personal story that has absolutely no bearing on the lesson and no relevancy to anyone in the room? Check your vibes.\n\n5. Are you eating a tuna sandwich and/or clipping your nails on the bus? Check your vibes.\n\n6. Are you signing your tax returns in blood as a protest against the evils of Obamacare? Check your vibes.\n\n7. Are you writing a Yelp review of a chain restaurant that begins with the phrase, \u201cLet me start by saying I studied abroad in Siena for 2 months, so I know linguini\u201d? Check your vibes.\n\n8. Are you paying someone to put diapers on your dogs? Check your vibes.\n\n9. Are you recounting, in great detail, a marginally funny skit from an episode of SNL a few months ago and wondering why no one is laughing? Check your vibes.\n\n10. Are you blowing your nose in a Starbucks napkin and then crumpling it up and leaving it next to the carafe of half and half? Check your vibes.\n\n11. Are you carrying an antique ventriloquist dummy around in a baby bjorn? Check your vibes.\n\n12. Are you asking your coworkers to help you pop a back zit and getting offended when they decline? Check your vibes, dude. Just check your damn vibes.\n\n[Good Vibes Only print available on Etsy]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yesterday I was taking an early morning walk around downtown Nashville, as I do most days before work.
