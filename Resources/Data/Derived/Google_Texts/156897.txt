Autism is a genetic disorder that manifests itself in 1 in every 50 schoolchildren, with a four time higher prevalence in the male population of the world.

You have managed to get through Christmas and you have greeted the new year with a sigh. You are not alone, however. You wanted things to go smoothly, but they rarely do as you have found. You don't know what you do wrong but few things ever seem to go right. Your children are not like other children though and you cannot act with them as other parents act with their children. Your children are special in many ways. They may see or hear things most neurotypical individuals cannot. They are probably some of the smartest in their classes.
