[i] It\u2019s an important change because DoL has historically opposed state efforts to expand coverage for private sector workers, viewing them as an effort to evade the consumer protections of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). If the state efforts are encouraged, rather than discouraged, tens of millions of uncovered Americans could have more secure retirements.\n\nWhy is this so important? Because for most people, the difference between security and poverty in their retirement is whether they have some kind of retirement plan. It their employer offers a plan and they\u2019re automatically enrolled in it, some 90% of people who work get a plan. Without that employer support, less than ten percent will do so on their own. However many employers \u2013 especially the millions of small businesses \u2013 don\u2019t have the resources to set up a traditional plan and don\u2019t want the extensive federal regulation that comes with such plans. That\u2019s why almost half of US workers don\u2019t have one.\n\nSeveral years ago, the Administration proposed that businesses which did not offer some sort of retirement plan be required to offer their employees a payroll-deduction savings plan. Importantly, the requirement would be limited to offering automatically-enrolled savings for the employees through payroll deduction \u2013 there would be no requirement to establish a traditional plan or undergo the extensive regulation they involve under ERISA. This \u201cIRA auto-enrollment\u201d proposal was originally bipartisan[ii], but became associated with the rather different employer mandate in the Affordable Care Act and so went nowhere in Congress.\n\nVarious states responded to the inaction in Washington by proposing auto-enrollment programs of their own. Following the title of the first legislation to be enacted, in California[iii], these are generally referred to as \u201cSecure Choice\u201d programs. Although there are various models, the most frequently considered one would have the state require a payroll-deduction auto-enrollment program of those employers currently not offering a retirement plan. Unless employees choose to opt out, a portion of their paycheck would automatically be deposited in a retirement savings plan. The State of Illinois enacted a secure choice plan into law earlier this year and similar bills been introduced in more than a dozen other states.\n\nUntil recently, DoL opposed these efforts. [iv] In order to obtain the assent of small businesses, states wanted to guarantee that the new programs would not involve businesses in ERISA\u2019s fiduciary obligations; as a result, legislation in some states specifically provided that the plans could not be subject to ERISA. DoL, for its part, took the view that only plans covered by ERISA had satisfactory consumer protections and that even if the state operated the plan and employers were required to participate, contributing employers would nonetheless remain fiduciaries. This interpretation by DoL has been criticized by some ERISA attorneys[v], but until today there was no evidence the Department would reconsider. The President\u2019s announcement means that DoL will now be an ally of the state efforts \u2013 and as a result tens of millions can have more secure retirement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Today, at the White House Conference on Aging, the President announced that he was directing the Department of Labor to undertake a rulemaking to facilitate state programs to increase retirement coverage.", "title": "Obama acts to help states expand retirement coverage --  most significant retirement move of the Administration", "og": {"site_name": "The Brookings Institution", "description": "Today, at the White House Conference on Aging, the President announced that he was directing the Department of Labor to undertake a rulemaking to facilitate state programs to increase retirement coverage.", "title": "Obama acts to help states expand retirement coverage --  most significant retirement move of the Administration", "url": "http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2015/07/14-administration-help-states-expand-retirement-coverage-gotbaum", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/blogs/up%20front/2015/07/obamaretirement/obamaretirement_16x9.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en", "type": "website", "determiner": "auto"}, "twitter": {"description": "Today, at the White House Conference on Aging, the President announced that he was directing the Department of Labor to undertake a rulemaking to facilitate state programs to increase retirement coverage.", "creator": "JoshGotbaum", "image": {"width": 560, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu//~/media/blogs/up%20front/2015/07/obamaretirement/obamaretirement_16x9.jpg?w=560", "height": 315}, "title": "Obama acts to help states expand retirement coverage --  most significant retirement move of the Administration", "site": {"identifier": "BrookingsInst", "id": 151106990}, "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 151106990}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 137459917707}, "ces": {"broadcontenttype": "Commentary ; Blog Posts", "programs": "Economic Studies", "topics": "Social Policy ; Retirement, Saving and Pensions", "topicsbroad": "Social Policy", "experts": "Joshua Gotbaum", "authors": "Joshua Gotbaum", "contentdate": "2015/07/14 11:00:00", "title": "Obama acts to help states expand retirement coverage --  most significant retirement move of the Administration", "researchactivities": "Retirement Security Project ; Economic Studies", "topicsspecialized": "Retirement, Saving and Pensions", "projects": "Retirement Security Project"}, "keywords": "retirement, department of labor, obama administration", "article": {"tag": "Retirement, Saving and Pensions", "published_time": "2015-07-14", "modified_time": "2015-7-14", "author": "Joshua Gotbaum"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe25c2\"", "article_summary": "Because for most people, the difference between security and poverty in their retirement is whether they have some kind of retirement plan.\nIf the state efforts are encouraged, rather than discouraged, tens of millions of uncovered Americans could have more secure retirements.\nSeveral years ago, the Administration proposed that businesses which did not offer some sort of retirement plan be required to offer their employees a payroll-deduction savings plan.\nThe President\u2019s announcement means that DoL will now be an ally of the state efforts \u2013 and as a result tens of millions can have more secure retirement.\nYesterday, at the White House Conference on Aging, the President unveiled the most important contribution to improved retirement security of his administration: He directed the Department of Labor to start helping state programs that increase retirement coverage."}
