He now leads Clinton by a slim margin in Iowa for the first time.\n\nUntil now, Chelsea Clinton has shied away from directly naming Sanders in her speeches. She took a shot at the Vermont senator when asked by a young voter how to best galvanize young Americans, who are excited about Sanders' candidacy.\n\nThe youngest Clinton was on the defensive. \u201cI never thought that I would be arguing about the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare in the Democratic primary,\u201d Clinton said at an event in Manchester. \u201cSenator Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the CHIP program, dismantle Medicare and private insurance.\u201d\n\nShe then went on to say that she believes her mother has a \u201cmore robust\" record on health care than anyone else in the race.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has said that Chelsea Clinton will continue stumping for her mother on the campaign trail. She will join her father, former President Bill Clinton, in Iowa for a joint campaign event this weekend.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Chelsea Clinton Takes on Bernie Sanders", "description": "Chelsea Clinton Takes on Bernie Sanders", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Chelsea Clinton made her way around New Hampshire today in attempt to convince voters that they should support her mother, Hillary Clinton, as the next president.\nBernie Sanders, Clinton's chief rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, is practically tied with Clinton in voter polls.
