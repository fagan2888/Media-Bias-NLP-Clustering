Readers rarely believe it, but I am not on any political team. Generosity toward the high and mighty isn\u2019t among my few virtues. But this needs to be said: Americans are lucky to have Barack Obama as president and we should wake up and appreciate it while we can.\n\nPresident Obama will go down in history as an extraordinary president, probably a great one. He will have done this in an era that doesn\u2019t aggrandize leaders and presidents, but shrinks them. All presidents have had profound opposition, vicious enemies and colossal failures. A few were beloved and others deeply respected in their day, but none in the modern era and certainly not Obama.\n\nWhy? Marcus Aurelius said, \u201cMan is puny in the face of destiny.\u201d If the stoic king were writing about modern, democratic sovereigns, he might say, \u201cKings are puny in a world blind to destiny, a world seen through the sacred screens of televisions and computers that can view only the puny.\u201d\n\nMany presidents fared better in history than in office. But it would be a morale booster and a sign of civic maturity if more Americans appreciated what an exceptional president they have right now. It could be a long wait for the next one.\n\nOne can hate Democrats, disagree with Obama on big issues, dislike his style or be disappointed the excitement of his election didn\u2019t last. But his accomplishments, ambitious goals, dignity and honesty under tough circumstances demand admiration and appreciation.\n\nThis is, of course, perverse liberal-media propaganda to conservative Obama-haters. It\u2019s wobbly centrism to a left-flank frustrated Obama hasn\u2019t done more for them. And it\u2019s na\u00efve hot air to Washington\u2019s political clans that think Obama doesn\u2019t play the game well.\n\nChanging minds with a keypad is a fool\u2019s errand; I\u2019m surely a fool, but not on that count. I simply offer some points for the open-minded to ponder.\n\n1. The Iran deal: Time will reveal if the deal worked, not today\u2019s talking/tweeting heads. What cannot be in dispute is this was a momentous initiative, a gutsy political risk, a diplomatic success and, potentially, a giant step in defusing a long-ticking time bomb.\n\n2. Obamacare: In the midst of the worst economy since the Great Depression, Obama delivered one of the most important domestic programs since the New Deal. Only LBJ\u2019s Great Society laws compare. Obamacare has survived two challenges in the Supreme Court and constant, kabuki-style congressional votes to repeal. It\u2019s now off life support. Key goals are being met. It will evolve and improve. One day it will be taken for granted and people will say, \u201cKeep the government out of my Obamacare.\u201d\n\n3. The financial meltdown: Obama inherited it, then managed the recovery to the degree possible in the global economy. The recovery has been steady, though slow. The worst-case predictions didn\u2019t happen. He began to reverse the deregulation of the financial industry. He delivered a significant Asian trade deal. Yet few give Obama much credit.\n\n4. The First: Becoming the first black president is itself an epic triumph. Obama doesn\u2019t get much good will for that any more. We properly canonize Rosa Parks, Jackie Robinson and Martin Luther King. Of Obama, we ask, \u201cWhat have you done for me lately?\u201d That\u2019s fair, he\u2019s president. He doesn\u2019t ask for credit for being the first black one. He and his family are at risk every day and we take their courage for granted.\n\n5. Dignity and honesty: Obama\u2019s administration has been as free of corruption and, well, peccadillo as any in memory. It\u2019s the first two-term presidency not to be derailed by scandal since Eisenhower. A few will stay in paranoid lather about Benghazi or Fast and Furious, but those pseudo-scandals don\u2019t compare to Watergate, Iran-Contra, Bill Clinton\u2019s carnal antics or the phony evidence used to justify attacking Iraq.\n\nObama has weathered a recession, invisible racism, a reckless Republican Congress, a lily-livered Democratic Party, attacks from the richest pressure groups ever (Super PACs) and a 24/7, ADHD press corps under existential pressure to deliver page views and Nielsen ratings. He has done it with the \u201cNo Drama Obama\u201d style that befits the office.\n\nObama isn\u2019t a performer like Reagan or a preacher like Clinton. He\u2019s head over heart, cool over warm. Yet he did his pastoral duties after Sandy Hook, the Boston Marathon and Charleston. He wasn\u2019t a catalyst for same-sex marriage, but nourished the culture that made it possible.\n\nIt is harder than ever to see the big canvas and thus find fresh perspectives. We view current events as puny rivers of Tweets, not grand chapters in the ultimate story -- history.\n\nIn that longer view, we should feel well served. So, Mr. President, on behalf of an ungrateful nation, thank you.\n\n[My Obama column had a mistake: Racism is not invisible]", "article_metadata": {"isPremium": "false", "description": "I\u2019ve never written a column like this.\u00a0 Readers rarely believe it, but I am not on any political team. \u00a0Generosity toward the high and mighty isn\u2019t among my few virtues.\u00a0 But this needs to be said:...", "author": "Dick Meyer", "og": {"site_name": "7NEWS", "description": "I\u2019ve never written a column like this.\u00a0 Readers rarely believe it, but I am not on any political team. \u00a0Generosity toward the high and mighty isn\u2019t among my few virtues.\u00a0 But this needs to be said: Americans are lucky to have Barack Obama as president and we should wake up and appreciate it while we can.", "title": "Mr. President, on behalf of an ungrateful nation, thank you", "url": "http://www.thedenverchannel.com/decodedc/mr-president-on-behalf-of-an-ungrateful-nation-thank-you", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://sharing.thedenverchannel.com/sharescnn/photo/2015/07/16/2015-07-16-obama-crop_1437062516175_21523742_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 530249083, "iphone": 530157928}}, "site": "@DenverChannel", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "shortHeadline": "Opinion: Mr. President, thank you", "msvalidate.01": "F33258882556C3E953931ECED98AF6A1", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,scripps.mkt7057.com,www.TheDenverChannel.com,recp.mkt32.net", "keywords": "Obama, Iran, Obamacare, recession, black president, Benghazi, Fast and Furious, Watergate, Iran-Contra, Clinton, Sandy Hook, Boston Marathon, Charleston,", "fb": {"app_id": 144458145747494}, "idio": {"isPremium": "false", "author": "Dick Meyer"}, "isStory": "true", "google-site-verification": "uUMrVlkfL55atdkRY7Al-ScCLqhkhnV4TdqlMdjriHA", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/DenverChannel", "section": "DecodeDC", "published_time": "2015-07-22T20:30:56+0000", "modified_time": "2015-07-22T20:30:56+0000", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, target-densitydpi=device-dpi, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbcb5\"", "article_summary": "So, Mr. President, on behalf of an ungrateful nation, thank you.\nPresident Obama will go down in history as an extraordinary president, probably a great one.\nAnd it\u2019s na\u00efve hot air to Washington\u2019s political clans that think Obama doesn\u2019t play the game well.\nObama doesn\u2019t get much good will for that any more.\nBut this needs to be said: Americans are lucky to have Barack Obama as president and we should wake up and appreciate it while we can."}
