Sara Haider, a top engineer at Twitter, said she is leaving the company to take a position at Secret, a Silicon Valley startup that recently raised $8.6 million in funding.

After 4.5 incredible years at Twitter, I’ll be leaving the flock. Words cannot express the love and pride I have for Twitter and Vine. — Sara Haider (@pandemona) March 21, 2014

Secret, which lets people share messages anonymously with friends, took off after its buzzy launch earlier this year, though its position in the App Store rankings has fallen considerably since.

The app currently is only available on Apple’s App Store, and Secret says on its site that it is currently hiring people with a background in Android development and analytics. Haider, who starts at Secret on April 7, was one of the early engineers to work on Android at Twitter. Chrys Bader, one of Secret’s founders, welcomed Haider to the team. “Android users rejoice,” he tweeted.

A Twitter spokeswoman confirmed that Cayley Torgeson, Twitter’s head of analytics, is also leaving the company. Torgeson was in charge of the company’s internal analytics that tracked Twitter’s performance such as engagement and user growth rates. It is not clear where he is headed. The tech site Re/code first reported news of Torgeson’s departure.

The spokeswoman declined to comment further on both departures.

Their departures come several months after Twitter’s closely watched initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. In its first earnings report as a publicly traded company, Twitter said its user growth was slowing.
