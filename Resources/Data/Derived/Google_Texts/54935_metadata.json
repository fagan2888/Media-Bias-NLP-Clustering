Peter Shumlin and that state's legislature to enact universal health care in the Green Mountain State.\n\nVermont has had plans to implement a universal health care system in that state for some time now, but Gov. Shumlin put those plans on hold late last year, after concerns came up over how the system would be paid for.\n\nSee more news and opinion from Thom Hartmann at Truthout here.\n\nIn the letter to Shumlin, the professors argue that health care should be provided as a public good, and that financing it actually helps to save money in the long run.\n\nThe professors write in part that, \"Evidence from around the world demonstrates that publicly financed health care systems result in improved health outcomes, lower costs and greater equity. Public financing is not a matter of raising new money, but of distributing existing payments more equitably and efficiently.\"\n\nWhile the professors make a great point, the fact is that Vermont gave universal health care a great shot. That state tried hard to make it work, and did its best to bring health care to all Vermonters.\n\nBut Vermont is a very small state, with a population of just over 626,000 people. And, in a state that small, implementing universal health care is a very hard thing to do.\n\nFor universal health care to really be successful, it needs to be done at a national level.\n\nFortunately, the US already has the framework in place to make universal health care a success. That framework is called Medicare.\n\nA lot of people forget this but, back in July of 1965 when Medicare was established by Congress, it was established with the idea that one day it would be slightly changed to become THE national single-payer health insurance program for the US.\n\nWell, the day to make those changes is now.\n\nCurrently, Medicare is made up of four parts: Part A which covers hospital stays, Part B with pays for medical services, Part C which pays for private insurance coverage, and Part D with pays for prescription drugs.\n\nNow, it's time to create \"Medicare Part E,\" which would cover every single American. Just let any citizen in the US buy into Medicare.\n\nBest of all, creating \"Medicare Part E\" would be really easy. It wouldn't be some complicated process that requires Congress and the government to re-invent the wheel.\n\nAll Congress would have to do is pass a simple bill that says any American can buy into Medicare at a rate predetermined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nIn would also be pretty easy to get Americans enrolled in universal health care and \"Medicare Part E.\"\n\nBasically, as soon as legislation is passed approving \"Medicare Part E,\" the government would begin lowering the eligibility age for Medicare.\n\nEach year, the eligibility age would drop by a decade, letting around 30 million new Americans into the program.\n\nThis process would be repeated each year, and within seven years, all Americans are covered by Medicare.\n\nOf course, like with any idea, \"Medicare Part E\" has its opponents. There are people who just won't want to be part of it.\n\nLuckily for them, they would still be able to buy private health insurance, and hand over their hard-earned money to billionaire insurance executives.\n\nThat's because universal health care doesn't mean government-only or even government-run healthcare.\n\nIn fact, many of the 32 developed countries in the world that have a universal health care plan in place continue to have both public and private insurance and medical providers.\n\nAnd, in those countries where universal health care is in place, it's working wonders.\n\nTake Australia for example.\n\nIn Australia, universal health care is guaranteed to all Australians, and the program is working really well.\n\nIn 2003, Australia's death rate from conditions that can be medically treated was a whopping 50 percent less than in the US.\n\nThe framework for universal health care in the US is already in place and the resources for it to be successful are readily available. We just have to make it happen.\n\nThe United States is the ONLY free-market country in the world without a universal health care system.\n\nCountries with universal nonprofit health care don't have millions of people struggling to afford health care.\n\nAnd they don't have millions of people skipping out on prescriptions because they cost too much money.\n\nFrom Switzerland to Australia, and Norway to the UK, health care is considered a basic human right.\n\nNo one questions the notion that everyone, no matter who they are, is entitled to lifesaving and affordable health care.\n\nWhen it comes to improving health care in the US, Obamacare has been a great start, but it's just one piece of the puzzle.\n\nIt's time to enact \"Medicare Part E\" and ensure that all Americans have access to lifesaving and affordable health care.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/templates/ja_teline_iv_t3/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Truthout sparks action by revealing systemic injustice and providing a platform for transformative ideas through investigative reporting and analysis.", "title": "&quot;Medicare Part E&quot;: A Framework for Universal Health Care", "og": {"site_name": "Truthout", "description": "For universal health care to really be successful, it needs to be done at a national level.", "title": "''Medicare Part E'': A Framework for Universal Health Care", "url": "http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/29427-economists-demand-universal-health-care", "image": "http://www.truth-out.org/tologo.jpg", "type": "non_profit"}, "twitter": {"title": "&quot;Medicare Part E&quot;: A Framework for Universal Health Care", "site": "@truthout", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@truthout"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 286391544774433}, "author": "The Daily Take Team", "keywords": "Truthout, truth-out, truth out, independent news, nonprofit news, ad free news, progressive news, investigative reporting, critical analysis, BuzzFlash, headlines, commentary, fracking, Guantanamo, mass incarceration, prisons, new economy, police militarization, climate change", "google-site-verification": "EfgVxcdUDBF_Dd81ZBBw_J8FuRjGnvp9r2JAM9IhvUk", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "YES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdcb0\"", "article_summary": "Countries with universal nonprofit health care don't have millions of people struggling to afford health care.\nFortunately, the US already has the framework in place to make universal health care a success.\nFor universal health care to really be successful, it needs to be done at a national level.\nIn Australia, universal health care is guaranteed to all Australians, and the program is working really well.\nVermont has had plans to implement a universal health care system in that state for some time now, but Gov."}
