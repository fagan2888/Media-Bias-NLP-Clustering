But a Turkey-based Kurdish splinter group has claimed responsibility for the bombing and threatened more attacks.\n\nBefore the call with Obama, Erdogan said he was saddened by the West's refusal to call the Syrian Kurdish militia terrorists, and would explain to the U.S. president how weapons provided by the United States had aided them.\n\n\"I will tell him, 'Look at how and where those weapons you provided were fired',\" Erdogan told reporters in Istanbul.\n\n\"Months ago in my meeting with him I told him the U.S. was supplying weapons. Three plane loads arrived, half of them ended up in the hands of Daesh (Islamic State), and half of them in the hands of the PYD,\" he said.\n\n\"Against whom were these weapons used? They were used against civilians there and caused their deaths.\"\n\nHe appeared to be referring to a U.S. air drop of 28 bundles of military supplies in late 2014 meant for Iraqi Kurdish fighters near the Syrian city of Kobani. Pentagon officials said at the time one had fallen into the hands of Islamic State. The Pentagon later said it had targeted the missing bundle in an air strike and destroyed it.\n\nThe United States has said it does not consider the YPG a terrorist group. A spokesman for the State Department said on Thursday that Washington was not in a position to confirm or deny Turkey's charge that the YPG was behind the Ankara bombing.\n\nThe spokesman also called on Turkey to stop its recent shelling of the YPG. The YPG's political arm has denied the group was behind the Ankara attack and said Turkey was using it to justify an escalation in fighting in northern Syria.\n\n\"CONFLICTING AND CONFUSED\"\n\nThe Turkish government has said the Ankara attack, in which a car laden with explosives was detonated next to military buses as they waited at traffic lights, was carried out by a YPG member from northern Syria working with Kurdish militants inside Turkey.\n\nBut the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK), a group that once had links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), claimed responsibility for the bombing in a statement on its website. It said the bomber was a 26-year old Turkish national.\n\nThe claim of responsibility by TAK is unlikely to make a difference to Turkey's demand that Washington stop its support of the Syrian Kurdish fighters.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu earlier accused the United States of making conflicting statements about the Syrian Kurdish militia.\n\nHe said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had told him the Kurdish insurgents could not be trusted, in what Cavusoglu said was a departure from Washington's official position.\n\n\"My friend Kerry said the YPG cannot be trusted,\" Cavusoglu said at a news conference during a visit to Tbilisi.\n\n\"When you look at some statements coming from America, conflicting and confused statements are still coming.... We were glad to hear from John Kerry yesterday that his views on the YPG have partly changed.\"\n\nWithin hours of the Ankara attack, Turkish warplanes bombed bases in northern Iraq of the PKK, which has waged a three-decade insurgency against Turkey and which Davutoglu accused of collaborating in the car bombing.\n\nViolence between Turkish security forces and the PKK has been at its worst since the 1990s after a 2-1/2-year ceasefire collapsed last July.\n\nTwo soldiers and a police officer were killed on Friday in a PKK attack in the Sur district of the southeastern city of Diyarbakir, parts of which have been under round-the-clock curfew since December, the armed forces said.\n\nThree other soldiers were killed as a building collapsed in the same district.\n\n(Additional reporting by Daren Butler, Asli Kandemir, Lesley Wroughton, Roberta Rampton and Doina Chiacu in Washington; Writing by Nick Tattersall, David Dolan and Dasha Afanasieva; Editing by Mark Trevelyan and Andrew Heavens)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's presidency said U.S.", "title": "Turkey says Obama shares Syria concerns with Erdogan, affirms support", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/19/Turkeys-Erdogan-says-Syrian-Kurds-used-US-weapons-civilians", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/turkey-kurds_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/02/19/Turkeys-Erdogan-says-Syrian-Kurds-used-US-weapons-civilians", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/turkey-kurds_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's presidency said U.S.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The claim of responsibility by TAK is unlikely to make a difference to Turkey's demand that Washington stop its support of the Syrian Kurdish fighters.\nTurkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu earlier accused the United States of making conflicting statements about the Syrian Kurdish militia.\nEarlier on Friday, Erdogan had said U.S.-supplied weapons had been used against civilians by a Syrian Kurdish militia group that Ankara blames for the deadly suicide bombing this week.\nThe United States has said it does not consider the YPG a terrorist group.\n\"I will tell him, 'Look at how and where those weapons you provided were fired',\" Erdogan told reporters in Istanbul."}
