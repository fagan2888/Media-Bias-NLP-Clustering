Tell me a story, mama. Tell me a story about when you were little.\u201d\n\nAnd so I did.\n\nI told her of growing up in an Irish-Catholic neighborhood that spewed children like water from a fountain. Where the kids ran amok on summer nights, sloshing through mulberries and muddy alleys and into and out of each other\u2019s houses. We sat in front of fans on days when the Midwest heat lurched well into the 90s and there was no central air so we pulled in the warm, metal fan air with greedy gulps and then quickly dashed back outside.\n\nWe played games of tag in the relentless afternoon sun and spin the bottle as dusk settled and kids\u2019 names were called home one by one (or six by six).\n\nI remember the question, \u201cWhat should we do now?\u201d and silence as the answer because \u2014 well, because it was too hot to talk. And so we waited for an idea, sucking on bomb pops and fanning ourselves with sticky, stained hands.\n\nOne summer someone decided that the appliance store within walking distance was a Mecca of \u201cfort-building tools\u201d \u2014 namely, the boxes that the appliances arrived in. When one kid discovers a goldmine, all hell breaks loose. Word spreads like wildfire. Suddenly there were droves of children trekking down to that store \u2014 filthy knees poking from cut-off jean shorts as plans were formulated.\n\nWhen a shipment came in (refrigerator boxes were like winning some kind of kid lottery), the neighborhood would be abuzz. I remember building forts so elaborate, so intricate \u2014 with paintings on the wall and furniture fashioned from cardboard \u2014 that even the adults were impressed. And back then, that was a feat.\n\nNot like today, when we\u2019re amazed when our kids (and, yes, I\u2019m guilty, too) eat a bite of food or walk across the floor. We made stools and tables, added wilted flowers and doilies. And then we baked in the heat of our own creations, grinning from ear to ear in our secret worlds of cardboard and tape. We were hot and happy.\n\nUntil the wars broke out. Suddenly, forts were being attacked, alliances made, pacts created. It was like some kind of spontaneous psychology experiment gone \u201cLord of the Rings.\u201d It was a hoot.\n\nAnd then \u2026 it rained. A Midwestern storm left our forts looking like a cartoon battlefield, soaked and sagging. Bits and pieces of cardboard were strewn about yards like errant children. And so we moved on. We trudged on through that summer until the dreaded first day of school in September.\n\nAs I told the story, my daughter whispered \u201cDon\u2019t stop, mama. Tell me another one,\u201d even as her eyes began to waver and her hand fell loosely out of mine. Tomorrow night, I promised, tomorrow night I\u2019ll tell you another one.\n\nAnd that is the power of a story. We are storytellers \u2014 and story collectors \u2014 all of us. We search for them in the break rooms of our offices and around our dinner tables at night. Children swap stories on the playground just as adults trade stories at happy hour. We flock to movie theaters and flip on our TVs searching for tales that will keep our attention, spark a passion, take us somewhere we\u2019ve never been or show us a point of view we\u2019ve rarely considered.\n\nAs my daughter\u2019s eyelids fluttered and her breathing slowed, I knew we were lucky. We had stories to tell. The question is: How many can we make and share before our time runs out?\n\nSiobhan Sprecace lives in Englewood.
