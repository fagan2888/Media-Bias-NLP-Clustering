The Result Shouldn\u2019t Surprise Anyone. CREDIT:\n\nOn Tuesday morning, CNN baited its 11.7 million Twitter followers with a flippant tweet about rape:\n\nIn just 94 characters, CNN minimized a serious investigation and worthwhile read about Alaska\u2019s sexual assault epidemic. The rate of reported rapes is three times the national average in that state, where 59 percent of women have experienced sexual or intimate partner violence and 37 percent have reported being sexually assaulted.\n\nCNN has regularly used this tactic for its most tragic stories, copying a style popularized by the curation site Upworthy:\n\nUpworthy is credited for coining headlines that prompt readers to click and share, like \u201cWhen I Was A Kid, An Ad Aired On TV That I Didn\u2019t Fully Get. Now, I Want Us All To Watch It Again.\u201d But Upworthy editor Adam Mordecai condemned CNN for exploiting the tactic.\n\n\u201cEveryone keeps copying us as though every piece of content can or should be treated equally,\u201d Upworthy editor-at-large Adam Mordecai told ThinkProgress. \u201cThe curiosity gap is just a tool, and one that should be used strategically and tastefully. The casualness of that tweet makes it twice as appalling. It\u2019s not surprising that rape is so prevalent, it\u2019s disturbing and alarming that it\u2019s prevalent all over the country. A surprise is for birthdays. Not this.\u201d\n\nCNN hasn\u2019t deleted the tweet, but it did respond to the scrutiny on Twitter. \u201cTx for feedback. It\u2019s genuinely surprising Alaska\u2019s rape rate is so high. The story deserves attention,\u201d it said.\n\nIt does require attention, particularly since rape prevention activists continue to grapple with almost-daily examples of sexual assault and harassment not being taken seriously. But addressing issues of sexual assault also involves grappling with the best way for the media to cover it.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "What's the appropriate time and place for media outlets to bait readers with flippant headlines that get a maximum number of clicks?", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "What's the appropriate time and place for media outlets to bait readers with flippant headlines that get a maximum number of clicks?", "title": "CNN Copies Upworthy In Tweet About Rape.
