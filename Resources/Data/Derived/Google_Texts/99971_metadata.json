Chris Christie\u2019s failed presidential bid. Donald Simon, general counsel for Democracy 21, argued that this limited liability company could simply be an \u2018anonymous conduit\u2019 for \u2018hiding the true source of the funds.\u2019 That\u2019s why, along with the Campaign Legal Center, the group has now asked the Federal Election Commission to investigate the matter.\u201d\n\nDivided GOP feels out its next move \u2013> Alexander Burns reports for The New York Times: \u201cSpurred by Donald J. Trump\u2019s mounting victories, a small but influential \u2014 and growing \u2014 group of conservative leaders are calling for a third-party option to spare voters a wrenching general election choice between a Republican they consider completely unacceptable and Hillary Clinton.\u201d Wall Street is ready to throw millions at the anti-Trump effort, according to Politico\u2019s Ben White.\n\nCarson\u2019s finished, maybe \u2013> The candidate said he can\u2019t \u201csee a political path forward\u201d and won\u2019t participate in tonight\u2019s Republican debate.\n\nClinton\u2019s email server \u2013> Adam Goldman at Washington Post: \u201cThe Justice Department has granted immunity to a former State Department staffer, who worked on Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server, as part of a criminal investigation into the possible mishandling of classified information, according to a senior law enforcement official. The official said the FBI had secured the cooperation of Bryan Pagliano, who worked on Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign before setting up the server in her New York home in 2009.\u201d The Clinton campaign had encouraged Pagliano to testify before Congress.\n\nDifferent tune \u2013> Russ Choma at Mother Jones: \u201cA decade ago, before Trump was a politician, he had a much different view on outsourcing: It was often a good thing, he said. In 2005, Trump wrote a blog post on outsourcing that appeared on the website of his now defunct Trump University (which is the subject of a civil suit alleging fraud). The blog post was headlined, \u2018Outsourcing Creates Jobs in the Long Run.\u2019 In it, Trump advised workers who lost their jobs to adopt a longer view and consider how outsourcing could be good for the overall economy.\u201d\n\nPart of the explanation \u2013> At Vox, Amanda Taub looks at the one factor that determine whether a voter supports Trump: authoritarianism. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a voter who wants an actual dictator, but rather one with a psychological profile \u201cthat is characterized by a desire for order and a fear of outsiders. People who score high in authoritarianism, when they feel threatened, look for strong leaders who promise to take whatever action necessary to protect them from outsiders and prevent the changes they fear.\u201d\n\nTime for a change \u2013> At Buzzfeed, Evan McMorris-Santoro reports that many voters in states that caucus are fed up with the system. \u201cThey have confusing rules, weird tie breakers, people can\u2019t get off work to go to them (or may not have enough break time to stay), the ballots aren\u2019t secret, and the turnout is terrible.\u201d\n\nGrowing problem for democracy \u2013> Spotlight, the true story of crusading journalists at The Boston Globe, may have captured the academy award for Best Picture last week, but, today, the future of local journalism is growing dimmer. Dale Maharidge has an important longread at The Nation looking into what that means for unemployed and underemployed journalists, and for the country on the whole.\n\nScalia\u2019s friends \u2013> Reflecting on news that Scalia was on a secret-society hunting trip when he died, Jeffrey Toobin writes at The New Yorker that while he sees nothing wrong with Scalia hobnobbing with the rich and right-wing in his time off, friends can be revealing. His companion on the trip? \u201cC. Allen Foster, a seventy-four-year-old lawyer in D.C. Foster has a varied law practice, specializing in the law of construction, but also representing several right-leaning clients. He represented the Republican Party in redistricting cases and the company formerly known as Blackwater in a case arising out of the death of four of its contractors during the American occupation of Iraq.\u201d\n\nSome truth in it \u2013> The Onion: \u201cGOP Statisticians Develop New Branch Of Math To Formulate Scenarios In Which Trump Doesn\u2019t Win Nomination.\u201d\n\nMorning Reads was written by John Light and edited by Theresa Riley.
