The company has retained Sagent Advisors to explore market interest for the locations that were part of the 146 stores Haggen acquired from Albertson\u2019s earlier this year. The ill-fated deal precipitated Haggen\u2019s bankruptcy filing, which was followed quickly by a lawsuit that alleged Albertson\u2019s sabotaged Haggen\u2019s efforts to integrate the newly acquired stores.\n\n\n\nMoving forward, Haggen said in a statement that it intends to re-build its operations around a core group of successful stores made up of 37 locations in the Pacific Northwest. The core stores include 16 of Haggen\u2019s historical stores, one stand-alone pharmacy and 21 stores acquired from Albertson\u2019s.\n\n\n\n\u201cHaggen plans to continue to build its brand in partnership with its dedicated corporate support and store teams. Haggen has a long record of success in the Pacific Northwest and these identified stores will have the best prospect for ongoing excellence,\u201d said John Clougher, CEO of Haggen Pacific Northwest. \u201cAlthough this has been a difficult process and experience, we will remain concentrated in the Pacific Northwest where we began, focusing on fresh Northwest products and continuing our support and involvement in the communities we serve.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_thumbnail_image/09-2015/haggen-1.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Mike Troy", "description": "The bankrupt Haggen supermarket chain has listed 111 locations for sale, many in California, as the company looks to refocus its operations on 37 stores in the Pacific Northwest.", "og": {"image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_medium_image/09-2015/haggen-1.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "title": "Haggen puts 111 stores up for sale"}, "twitter": {"description": "The bankrupt Haggen supermarket chain has listed 111 locations for sale, many in California, as the company looks to refocus its operations on 37 stores in the Pacific Northwest.", "title": "Haggen puts 111 stores up for sale", "url": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/article/haggen-puts-111-stores-sale", "image": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_main_image/2015-09/haggen_1.jpg", "site": "@drugstorenews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-09-25 01:01:00", "sailthru.title": "Haggen puts 111 stores up for sale", "keywords": "Haggen, financial, retail news, pharmacy", "google-site-verification": "qD-DLdnS9RBbjYJ-MITi4cSvUByohsoX4WClEJJuv7I", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_main_image/2015-09/haggen_1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd38a1\"", "article_summary": "The core stores include 16 of Haggen\u2019s historical stores, one stand-alone pharmacy and 21 stores acquired from Albertson\u2019s.\nHaggen has a long record of success in the Pacific Northwest and these identified stores will have the best prospect for ongoing excellence,\u201d said John Clougher, CEO of Haggen Pacific Northwest.\nBELLINGHAM, Wash. \u2014 The bankrupt Haggen supermarket chain has listed 111 locations for sale, many in California, as the company looks to refocus its operations on 37 stores in the Pacific Northwest.\nThe company has retained Sagent Advisors to explore market interest for the locations that were part of the 146 stores Haggen acquired from Albertson\u2019s earlier this year.\nThe ill-fated deal precipitated Haggen\u2019s bankruptcy filing, which was followed quickly by a lawsuit that alleged Albertson\u2019s sabotaged Haggen\u2019s efforts to integrate the newly acquired stores."}
