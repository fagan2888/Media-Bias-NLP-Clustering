Other subjects covered in this variety issue: ways state vaccine exemption laws affect disease outbreaks; how states with strong health insurance rate review managed lower premiums; and characteristics of health care \u201csuper-utilizers.\u201d\n\nState Vaccination Exemption Laws, Exemption Rates, And Disease Outbreaks\n\nIn the United States, it is left to individual states to require that their kindergarteners show proof of vaccinations or have a vaccination exemption before being admitted to school. W. David Bradford and Anne Mandich of the University of Georgia analyzed how state-level vaccination exemption laws affect immunization rates and outbreaks of preventable diseases.\n\nBy measuring the association between each component of state kindergarten vaccination exemption laws and state vaccination exemption rates from 2002-12, they observed that policies such as requiring health department approval of nonmedical exemption applications, physician signatures on applications, and criminal or civil punishments for noncompliance significantly affected the reduction of vaccine exemptions. The authors created an index (below) identifying the states with the most (pale blue) and least (dark blue) effective laws. West Virginia and Mississippi do not allow nonmedical exemptions and so were not indexed. According to the authors\u2019 data, effective states had lower incidences of pertussis.\n\nStates By Quartile Of Exemption Law Effectiveness Index, 2012\n\nStrong State Health Insurance Rate Review Lowers Individual Premiums\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires many health insurance carriers to publicly justify a rate increase of 10 percent or more. In the first study to examine the impact of state review authority on individual premiums, Pinar Karaca-Mandic of the University of Minnesota and coauthors collected data on how states changed their rate review authority and requirements during 2010\u201313, combining these data with carrier filings.\n\nThey found that state-level prior approval authority over health insurance rates in the individual market in that period was associated with a 10 percentage point lower rate of increase in premiums. Their study provides early evidence that stronger forms of rate review authority may constrain health insurance premium increases in individual markets.\n\nProfile Of \u201cSuper-Utilizers\u201d: Their Needs May Be Short-Lived\n\nThe skewed distribution of health care costs has drawn attention to \u201csuper-utilizers\u201d \u2014 people who use the largest share of health care resources. Tracy Johnson of Denver Health and coauthors conducted cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of 4,774 publicly insured or uninsured super-utilizers at Denver Health between 2011 and 2013.\n\nAccording to their study, over time 3 percent of adult patients met the super-utilizer criteria and accounted for 30 percent of adult charges. However, only one-quarter of super-utilizers at any given time still met that definition one year later. The study also identified clinically important subgroups that may respond to different approaches to reduce avoidable health care use. The authors concluded that these findings have important implications for policy makers and for future program design and evaluation efforts, as previous studies have not fully explored this classification of important patient subgroups and instability of usage at the individual level.\n\nMental Health Parity Act: More Out-Of-Network Substance Abuse Services Used\n\nThe Mental Health Parity and Addiction Act of 2008 requires large group insurers to cover substance use disorder services at the same level as medical or surgical benefits, whether those services are provided in or out of network. In the first study to evaluate the effects of extending parity to out-of-network substance use disorder care, Emma McGinty at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and coauthors reviewed insurance claims for 525,620 substance use disorder service users to examine changes in the utilization of and spending on these services before and after the law\u2019s implementation.\n\nThe study showed that federal parity was associated with increases in: the likelihood of using out-of-network services; the number of out-of-network outpatient visits per user; and average total spending on those services among users. The authors found no changes in out-of-pocket spending due to federal parity, probably because of a rise in the average number of out-of-network substance abuse outpatient visits per user. The ACA requires Marketplace plans to include substance use disorder services as an essential health benefit. The authors note that understanding the effects of this law on out-of-network services is critical.\n\nAlso of interest in the August issue are several articles about hospital quality and care:\n\nAmbulance Diversion Associated With Reduced Access To Cardiac Technology And Increased One-Year Mortality; Yu-Chu Shen of the Naval Postgraduate School and Renee Hsia of the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nAssessing Medicare\u2019s Hospital Pay-For-Performance Programs And Whether They Are Achieving Their Goals; Charles Kahn of the Federation of American Hospitals and coauthors.\n\nWhy Medicare Advantage Plans Pay Hospitals Traditional Medicare Prices; Robert Berenson of the Urban Institute and coauthors.\n\nIn California, Not-For-Profit Hospitals Spent More Operating Expenses On Charity Care Than For-Profit Hospitals Spent; Erica Valdovinos of the Alameda County Medical Center and coauthors.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/08/03/health-affairs-august-issue-hospital-quality-and-care/", "site_name": "Health Affairs", "image": "http://healthaffairs.org/blog/wp-content/themes/HealthAffairs2015/images/facebook-default.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Health Affairs\u2019 August Issue: Hospital Quality And Care"}, "description": "Health Affairs\u2019 August Issue: Hospital Quality And Care | At the intersection of health, health care, and policy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Profile Of \u201cSuper-Utilizers\u201d: Their Needs May Be Short-LivedThe skewed distribution of health care costs has drawn attention to \u201csuper-utilizers\u201d \u2014 people who use the largest share of health care resources.\nChris FlemingAugust 3, 2015The August issue of Health Affairs contains a cluster of articles focusing on hospital quality and care.\nThe study also identified clinically important subgroups that may respond to different approaches to reduce avoidable health care use.\nW.
