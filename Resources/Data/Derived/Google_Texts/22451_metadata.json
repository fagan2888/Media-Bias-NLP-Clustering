The 8,000-pound gorilla in the room is the budget crisis we\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nIt is estimated that the state will end the fiscal year on June 30 with a $356 million shortfall but Cole said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be lucky if we get out at $400 million and it could be $450 million.\u201d\n\nCole, who is running for Governor, said, \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of appetite at the capitol for tax increases\u201d because they \u201ccould put an even larger burden on working people.\u201d\n\nState Senate Minority Leader Jeff Kessler, D-Marshall, who also is running for Governor, said, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to say the ugly \u2019T\u2019 word. We need to invest in roads, broadband. Everything we talk about is money. We can\u2019t cut enough.\u201d\n\nKessler favors increasing the state tax on tobacco and said the Legislature should consider raising taxes on beer, alcohol and gasoline and should look at raising Division of Motor Vehicle fees. \u201cYou don\u2019t fix roads on spit,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse Speaker Tim Armstead, R-Kanawha, said voters gave the Republicans control of the Legislature \u201cbecause they were frustrated. They wanted to see change. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Change is never easy.\n\n\u201cThe front-page news is we have some serious crises,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re losing population, we\u2019re last in workforce participation. We\u2019re at the bottom in terms of K through 12 educational achievement. Things are not where we want them to be. We have to attack them with bold solutions.\u201d\n\nMinority Leader Tim Miley, D-Harrison, said House Democrats are focused on restoring $120 million in health insurance benefit cuts affecting more than 200,000 public employees and retirees covered by the state Public Employees Insurance Agency.\n\n\u201cWe need to focus on jobs, education and health,\u201d Miley said. \u201cI think all of them are interrelated. We need to invest in those areas where we see positive results. You can\u2019t cut your way to prosperity.\u201d\n\nSteve White, executive director of the Affiliated Construction Trades Foundation, an umbrella group representing construction craft workers, said he\u2019s spent the current session defending the state\u2019s prevailing wage law and opposing a right-to-work proposal. \u201cI wish I was talking about infrastructure or workforce development or combating drug abuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe understand the change in power,\u201d he said, referring to the Legislature\u2019s shift from Democrat to Republican control. \u201cWe want to have an opportunity to try to find common ground. Frankly, that has not been the process. There\u2019s been debate but it\u2019s more a \u2018theater debate.\u2019 There\u2019s been no meaningful committee dialog, no sitting down and figuring out what you don\u2019t like in the current methodology.\u201d\n\nCorky DeMarco, executive director of the West Virginia Oil and Natural Gas Association, spoke about oil and natural gas. He predicted the Appalachian basin will be producing oil and natural gas \u201cmaybe for a thousand years.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got so smart now we\u2019ve kind of priced ourselves out of the market,\u201d DeMarco said, referring to the low price of oil and natural gas.\n\n\u201cWe used to get about 18 million to 20 million cubic feet of natural gas out of a good vertical well in a year,\u201d he explained. With horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, \u201cwe\u2019re now getting that out of a Marcellus Shale well in a day.\n\n\u201cWe know in the Utica Shale formation some wells are coming in at 88 million cubic feet a day,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that neither the Marcellus nor the Utica have tremendous declining production curves like conventional wells have. We also know there are other shale formations.\u201d\n\nDeMarco said the industry needs pooling legislation, which would in some circumstances allow companies to force uncooperative mineral owners to sign a lease. A pooling bill died on the last day of the session last year. \u201cWhether we\u2019ll get it this time or not, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.\n\nFrontier Communications spokesman Andy Malinoski spoke about broadband. He said customers want reliability, speeds that meet their needs, and a fair price.\n\nKevin Wallick, senior vice president and general manager of Frontier Communications in West Virginia, said, \u201cReliability is something we\u2019re working on all of the time.\u201d\n\nRegarding speed, Malinoski said, \u201cIn our market, 70 percent of customers who could buy faster speeds don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSo-called \u201clast-mile\u201d connections are what is most needed in West Virginia, Malinoski said, comparing the need to \u201cgetting the gravel road paved or the water line completed to your house.\u201d\n\nFred Earley, president of Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield West Virginia, spoke about health care challenges in the Mountain State.\n\nBecause of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and the expansion of Medicaid, about 10 percent of the state\u2019s population that didn\u2019t previously have health insurance does have it now, Earley said.\n\nThree quarters of patient revenue for hospitals in West Virginia now comes from government reimbursements. Those reimbursements are less than the cost of services. That puts more of the burden on commercial payers, he said.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental large-scale-picture question is, what can be done to make these government programs sustainable?\u201d he said. The state Public Employees Insurance Agency\u2019s funding problem \u201cis the leading edge of what we\u2019re seeing in this,\u201d he said.\n\nAARP West Virginia State Director Gaylene Miller spoke about issues affecting people aged 50 and up.\n\nMiller said AARP is pushing the Legislature to give nurse practitioners more leeway to provide primary care. She said AARP also wants to improve support for the state\u2019s estimated 300,000 family caregivers.\n\nIn addition, AARP wants to strengthen the criminal penalties for abuse, neglect or exploitation of vulnerable individuals, she said.\n\nPaul Hill, chancellor of the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission, said, \u201cHigher education is more important today than ever \u2014 particularly in a time of a shifting economy and uncertainties.\u201d\n\nHill noted that \u201cthere\u2019s an assertion out there that higher education is not as valuable now as it might have been. I believe that is emphatically incorrect. It has driven down our college-going rate in West Virginia. We\u2019re where we were in 1999, just because of that perception.\u201d\n\nThe Higher Education Policy Commission is focused on improving the college-going rate in West Virginia; increasing the college graduation rate; and preserving the affordability of a college education in the state, he said.\n\nThe Legislative Breakfast was Feb. 4 at the Charleston Marriott Hotel. It was sponsored by the press association with partners Frontier Communications, AARP WV, the West Virginia Oil and Natural Gas Association and Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield.\n\nKyle Lovern/WDN Photo State Senate President Bill Cole is shown speaking at the WVPA Legislative Breakfast.
