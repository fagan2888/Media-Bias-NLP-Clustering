White House chief of staff Denis McDonough this week said \u201caudacious\u201d executive actions on tap for 2016 are being carefully crafted to \u201cmake sure the steps we have taken are ones we can lock down and not be subjected to undoing through [Congress] or otherwise.\u201d But with only 12 months left in office, the president is increasingly constrained in what he can accomplish. Finalizing executive orders and regulations takes time, and the administration is already scrambling to put in place dozens of executive orders and regulations that have already been announced. A White House official was non-committal when asked about which specific executive actions the president might be considering.\n\nStep one: Replace Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson and Roosevelt in the Washington Nationals\u2019 Presidents Race with Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky.\n\n* Donald Trump brings his unique brand of pandering to Liberty University:\n\nRepublican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump promised to \u201cprotect Christianity\u201d during his Martin Luther King, Jr. Day convocation address at Virginia\u2019s evangelical Liberty University. \u201cWe\u2019re going to protect Christianity,\u201d Trump told the audience. \u201cI can say that, I don\u2019t have to be politically correct.\u201d The GOP candidate made several pointed attempts to appeal to the young, Christian crowd during his address, mentioning his pride in his Protestant faith and his oft-repeated campaign promise that the phrase \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d will become repopularized if he moves into the Oval Office. While promoting his book \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d he made sure to note that \u201cthe Bible blows it away. There\u2019s nothing like the Bible.\u201d\n\nYou know who knew how to make a deal? Yahweh. Terrific deal-maker. One of the best.\n\n* McKay Coppins argues that Donald Trump\u2019s thoughts on religion are built on hostility to anything other than mainline Protestantism.\n\n* Molly Ball reports on the tearing apart of the Republican Party as seen from the campaign trail.\n\n* Some Republican candidates say that when it comes to Iran, when they\u2019re president they\u2019ll Reagan like Reagan did, with extra Reagan. Steve Benen reminds us of Ronald Reagan\u2019s actual record on Iran. Here\u2019s a hint: Guess which president sold them weapons to give to terrorists?\n\n* Jamil Smith reminds us of Martin Luther King\u2019s radical politics, at a time when even conservatives celebrate a sanitized version of King.\n\n* Rebecca Traister notes that last night\u2019s was the fourth Democratic debate without a question on reproductive rights, which is particularly odd given that Hillary Clinton has been loudly advocating to overturn the Hyde amendment.\n\n* Jonathan Chait makes the case against Bernie Sanders, namely that he offers a vision no more realistic than Barry Goldwater\u2019s or George McGovern\u2019s.\n\n* Jonathan Cohn explains Sanders\u2019s newly released single-payer health-care plan.\n\n* Michael Tomasky says that questions about Sanders\u2019s age are perfectly legitimate, given that he\u2019d be the oldest president in history.\n\n* Tierney Sneed reports on the status of the GOP replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act. Let\u2019s say prospects don\u2019t look good.\n\n* Harold Meyerson says that last night\u2019s debate showed that Hillary Clinton is a fox and Bernie Sanders is a hedgehog.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our nightly wrap-up of news and opinion.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Our nightly wrap-up of news and opinion.", "title": "Happy Hour Roundup", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/01/18/happy-hour-roundup-774/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2015-12-28/Getty/AFP_6P999.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulwaldman1"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2016/01/18/happy-hour-roundup-774/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Post Keywords", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Post Keywords"}, "article_summary": "Step one: Replace Washington, Lincoln, Jefferson and Roosevelt in the Washington Nationals\u2019 Presidents Race with Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky.\n* Donald Trump brings his unique brand of pandering to Liberty University:Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump promised to \u201cprotect Christianity\u201d during his Martin Luther King, Jr. Day convocation address at Virginia\u2019s evangelical Liberty University.\n* Some Republican candidates say that when it comes to Iran, when they\u2019re president they\u2019ll Reagan like Reagan did, with extra Reagan.\nA White House official was non-committal when asked about which specific executive actions the president might be considering.\n* Harold Meyerson says that last night\u2019s debate showed that Hillary Clinton is a fox and Bernie Sanders is a hedgehog."}
