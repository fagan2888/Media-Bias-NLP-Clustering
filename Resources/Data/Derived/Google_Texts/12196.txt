Two things going on here.

Obama is pretending to be a non-ideological centrist, when he's a dogmatic leftist consistently pushing a radical agenda regardless of the damage it does. And he's acting as if you can mix together slavery and freedom, a totalitarian program and an individualistic one.

"So often in the past there has been a division between left and right, between capitalists and communists or socialists, and especially in the Americas, that’s been a big debate," Obama said during a visit to Argentina Thursday. "Oh, you know, you're a capitalist Yankee dog, and oh, you know, you're some crazy communist that's going to take away everybody's property."



"Those are interesting intellectual arguments, but I think for your generation, you should be practical and just choose from what works. You don’t have to worry about whether it really fits into socialist theory or capitalist theory. You should just decide what works," he added. "And I said this to President Castro in Cuba."

Obama is a 100 percent theory guy. Which is why he doubles down on freeing terrorists from Gitmo or pushing ObamaCare. He doesn't care about what works, but what works for the left.

But glowing media accounts had him burying the last of the Cold War. Which also means pretending that there's no significant difference between Communism and free enterprise, that both contain ideas and programs that can be used and mixed together into a hybrid free-slave state.

There are fundamental differences here. There's no center between Communism and free enterprise. As President Lincoln said, "I believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free."

No nation can endure half slave and half free, half individualistic and half Socialist.
