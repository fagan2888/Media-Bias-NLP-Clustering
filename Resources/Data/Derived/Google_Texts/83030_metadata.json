Those who had depression were younger and heavier. They also had more circulatory and heart problems as well as more inflammation in their blood. \u201cWe asked, why is depression so bad for diabetes? The study suggests that we have a possible biological explanation. Inflammation may be driving a number of different long-term conditions. That\u2019s quite a new way of thinking of the mind and the body,\u201d Dr. Khalida Ismail told Reuters Health\n\nFor the study, researchers analyzed the differences between participants, such as their age, sex, amount of body fat, and use of certain medications. Several inflammatory markers were linked to depression. So what is the relationship between inflammation in depression and diabetes patients? \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like an engine,\u201d Ismail said. \u201cYou\u2019re running a bit higher. So there\u2019s this constant low-grade inflammation and that\u2019s causing damage to your brain, your pancreas, and to your vascular system.\u201d\n\nResearchers say the correlation between depression and inflammation is very tricky to understand. Dr. Anne Peters told Reuters that \u201cthe development of depression could in part be triggered by inflammation, but we don\u2019t know what comes first. This paper can\u2019t prove causality. The interplay is so complicated.\u201d According to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), people with diabetes double their chances of developing depression, while people with depression are more likely to develop diabetes. The correlation between the two still requires a lot more research.\n\nThe CDC reports that diabetes affects one in 12 people, while one out of 10 adults has depression. Both illnesses can be treated with proper nutrition and exercise. \u201cIf you exercise, you feel better, your inflammatory markers improve. It\u2019s all about lifestyle interplaying with your health. We\u2019re just living lives we were not made to live. We sit still too much at work. We\u2019re caged up in a way,\u201d Peters said.\n\nBoth depression and diabetes can be treated simultaneously, according to Everyday Health. Some symptoms you can look for include irritability, loss of appetite or overeating, pain, cramps, and headaches.\n\nSource: Laake J, Stahl D, Amiel S, et al.
