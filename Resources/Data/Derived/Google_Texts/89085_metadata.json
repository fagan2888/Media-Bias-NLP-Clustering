Not in 2016 MORE\u2019s left on financial reform, and pushing for a policy to break up big banks staunchly advocated by Sen. Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth WarrenAn all-female ticket? Not in 2016 Trump sticks by 'Pocahontas' nickname after being challenged Trump: Warren \u2018as Native American as I am\u2019 MORE (D-Mass.).\n\nThe GOP presidential candidate laid out his vision for Wall Street reform in a speech Wednesday. And among his policy proposals, Perry apparently advocated for the return of the Glass-Steagall Act, which established a firewall between traditional commercial banking and investment banking.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPerry\u2019s stance would put him further to the left on that particular point than Clinton, and squarely in the camp of Warren and Sen.(I-Vt.).\n\nIn remarks delivered in New York, Perry did not mention Glass-Steagall by name, but floated among several policy proposals one that is practically identical.\n\n\u201cWe could once again require banks to separate their traditional commercial lending and investment banking and related practices,\u201d he said, according to prepared remarks.\n\nPerry also floated an alternate idea of requiring large banks to hold additional capital as a cushion, but the idea of cleanly separating commerical and investment banking was a signature provision of Glass-Steagall.\n\nLiberals like Warren have pushed for Glass-Steagall\u2019s return for years, after it was repealed under President Clinton. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who is also running for president, argued that its return should be a central plank of any Democratic presidential platform.\n\nSome GOP lawmakers have signed on to the effort, but Perry\u2019s remarks make him the first in a crowded GOP field to float the idea.\n\nAnd while he criticized her as newfound \u201cproponent of Warrenism\u201d due to her recent proposal to increase capital gains taxes, Perry\u2019s particular position also puts him to the left of Hillary Clinton. The Democratic frontrunner has struck a cautious tone about the law, saying the matter of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d is more complex than one single law.\n\nPerry\u2019s speech Thursday is among the most detailed remarks on Wall Street from a GOP candidate thus far, and he endeavored to thread a politically precarious needle.\n\nHe gave a nod to the lingering public discontent towards Wall Street and the wealthy, while arguing that Washington politicians and bureaucrats deserve a hefty share of the blame for the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\u201cI am tired of politicians bashing Wall Street while ignoring the sins of Washington, DC,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd while he vowed to never bail out a bank if elected president, he blamed the nation\u2019s housing policies before the crisis for sowing the seeds of the meltdown. He also criticized the Federal Reserve, saying it kept rates too low for too long before the crisis, encouraging the housing bubble.\n\nBut when it comes to regulating Wall Street, he argued that the Dodd-Frank financial reform law missed the mark.\n\n\u201cDodd-Frank took aim at Wall Street and the bullet went right through them and hit Main Street,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile favoring stronger cushions for big banks, Perry argued that community banks, banks run as partnerships and asset management firms should be wholly exempted from Dodd-Frank\u2019s new rules. He also said \u201corderly liquidation authority,\u201d a new Dodd-Frank power that lets regulators step in and wind down a failing financial institution, should be scrapped and replaced with a new big bank bankruptcy process.\n\nPerry also called on Congress to wind down housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but did not detail a process for doing so. There is bipartisan agreement that the current housing finance system, in which Fannie and Freddie guarantee the vast majority of new mortgages, is unsustainable, but coming up with a new system has been a significant challenge.\n\nIn the meantime, Perry said the two government-sponsored enterprises should be placed under stricter rules regarding the types of mortgages they can back, while encouraging private entities to adopt a bigger role in the marketplace.\n\nHe also pushed for changes to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau long favored by Republicans, including bringing its budget under congressional control and reworking its leadership structure.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Former Texas Gov.
