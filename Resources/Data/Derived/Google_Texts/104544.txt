When this Obamacare bill comes due, will there be nearly enough money to pay it?

An important tool meant to limit the financial risk of Obamacare insurers is expected to be grossly underfunded and "may make the U.S. insurance market less stable, not more," a new analysis warns.

The amount of money that profitable insurers expect to pay into the program was less than an estimated 10 percent what is expected to be paid out to unprofitable insurers, the Standard & Poor's Ratings Services report found.

The analysis assumes Congress will continue mandating that the program must be self-sustaining from insurers' payments, and not tap government funds.

As a result, some insurers may have a tougher time covering their costsâ€”and Obamacare customers in some areas of the country may face higher premium prices in 2016.
