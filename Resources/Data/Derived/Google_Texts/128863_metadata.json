Nothing is going to be given to you. We have to be stronger and tougher, and we have to be more efficient offensively.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t wallow in this loss. We\u2019ve got to learn from it and it\u2019s got to sting enough that we come out with the eye of the tiger on Sunday night, ready to scratch and claw and do whatever we\u2019ve got to do.\u201d\n\nAfter shooting a season-low 32 percent from the floor and tallying only six assists \u2014 four off the bench from freshman Thomas Akyazili, two from Josh Fortune and none from starting point guard Dom Collier in 20 minutes \u2014 CU will attempt to get its offense back on track. That offense had been the team\u2019s strength for much of the season.\n\nCU (11-3, 0-1 Pac-12) shot below 40 percent just twice in its first 11 games but has been under that figure in each of the past three games, shooting only 36 percent during that span. The Buffaloes\u2019 scoring average has dropped from a season-high 85.7 points per game after beating Hampton in Boulder on Dec. 19 to 81.8.\n\nFriday\u2019s game against California marked the seventh time this season, and second game in a row, the Buffs finished with more turnovers (eight) than assists (six).\n\n\u201cEvery game is important. We just have to approach the (Stanford) game more ready than we were (at California),\u201d Collier said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to have a short memory and be ready for Sunday, because we know they\u2019re a good team.\u201d\n\nStanford (8-4, 1-0) struggled through injury issues during nonconference games but opened Pac-12 play with an emphatic statement, knocking off No. 21 Utah 70-68 in overtime.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to learn from the (California) game and move on to the next one,\u201d said Josh Scott, a 6-foot-10 senior. \u201cYou take what you learn and apply it to the next game. It\u2019s conference play. Stuff happens. You\u2019re going to have ups and downs. (Friday) was a down, but we\u2019re going to learn from it and keep going up.\u201d\n\nHolding pattern. Injured senior Xavier Johnson rejoined the Buffs in the Bay Area but still has not met with Boyle regarding his status for the remainder of the season. Johnson suffered a torn Achilles tendon last summer and has yet to resume full workouts at practice. Johnson remains in limbo as to whether he will attempt a comeback for the remainder of the Buffs\u2019 Pac-12 schedule or take a medical redshirt.\n\nFootnotes. Second-leading scorer George King has made only 31 percent of his shots (10-of-32) the past three games, including a 4-for-15 performance from 3-point range. \u2026 Fortune played only four minutes in the first half of the Cal game after picking up two quick fouls and finished with a season-low three points.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Boyle: Colaordo Buffaloes had better \u201ctoughen up\u201d on road", "title": "Boyle: Colaordo Buffaloes had better \u201ctoughen up\u201d on road", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/02/boyle-colaordo-buffaloes-had-better-toughen-up-on-road/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160102__Colorado-Buffaloes-basketballp1.jpg", "height": 457}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160102__Colorado-Buffaloes-basketballp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-02T21:38:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T22:55:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to learn from the (California) game and move on to the next one,\u201d said Josh Scott, a 6-foot-10 senior.\n(Friday) was a down, but we\u2019re going to learn from it and keep going up.\u201dHolding pattern.\nWe just have to approach the (Stanford) game more ready than we were (at California),\u201d Collier said.\nThe Buffaloes\u2019 scoring average has dropped from a season-high 85.7 points per game after beating Hampton in Boulder on Dec. 19 to 81.8.\nFriday\u2019s game against California marked the seventh time this season, and second game in a row, the Buffs finished with more turnovers (eight) than assists (six)."}
