With several justices in their 80s by the middle of the next presidential term, the 45th president could have up to three Supreme Court vacancies to fill. Thus, the next occupant of the White House could dramatically shift the court in such a way that will reverberate for decades.\n\nNot only has Scalia's death changed the court's dynamics, it also has far reaching impacts on many issues. This court has heard or agreed to hear cases involving the constitutionality of considering race in college admissions, states' rights in restricting abortion, union agency fees, immigration policy and religious freedom and access to contraception.\n\nUnless a justice is sitting at the court at the time of argument and when the decision is issued, the justice's vote does not count. Any votes by Scalia on cases already argued and any opinions he was drafting are negated.\n\nScalia represented the fifth vote for conservatives on the court and in those cases that were expected to split 5-4 on ideological grounds; his death would affect the outcome. In the event of a 4-4 decision, the court upholds the lower court's ruling, but the decision is not precedent and not binding on the rest of the country. Thus, leaving the door open for further challenges.\n\nWe had one such example last week in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association. Friedrichs sought to overturn Supreme Court precedent that states although public workers who decline to join the union cannot be required to pay for the union's political activities, they can be charged an agency fee to pay for other costs, such as collective bargaining efforts. Opponents claim that collective bargaining itself is political speech and compelling them to subsidize it violates the First Amendment.\n\nWhen the case was argued in January, Scalia and the other conservative justices seemed ready to vote against the unions. With Scalia's death, the court deadlocked 4-4, leaving the Ninth Circuit's ruling in favor of the unions intact.\n\nOn Tuesday, the court issued an unusual order in Zubik v. Burwell, seemingly to avoid another deadlock. Zubik addresses the accommodation for religious nonprofits seeking to opt out of the Affordable Care Act's contraception coverage requirement and focuses on whether the mandate violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. That is the same law that the court applied two years ago in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, to protect the religiously devout owners of closely held, for-profit businesses from having to provide birth control to their female employees.\n\nTuesday's order asked the parties to address \"whether and how contraceptive coverage may be obtained by the petitioners' employees through petitioners' insurance companies but in a way that does not require any involvement beyond their own decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage.\" The order also sketched out how this might work.\n\nAnother case that might also be deadlocked: President Obama's executive action to defer deportations of undocumented immigrants. The Fifth Circuit Court upheld an injunction blocking the act's implementation. The court agreed to hear the case and to examine whether presidential power extends to immigration.\n\nIn Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstedt, the Fifth Circuit Court upheld a Texas law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. It resulted in the shutdown of many abortion clinics. The clinics have challenged the law claiming it poses an undue burden on women seeking an abortion in violation of the 14th Amendment.\n\nAlthough the court could have these cases re-argued in the next term that would only occur if a new justice joins the court before the October term begins. And if Republican leaders hold to their pledge not to confirm Judge Merrick Garland, it could affect the next term as well; impacting the cases the future court accepts and decides.\n\nIf Garland is not confirmed, two likely scenarios could occur: a liberal nominee selected by Hillary Clinton, or a complete wildcard chosen by Donald Trump. As the debate rages on, one wonders if Scalia, a constitutional originalist, would tell them to simply do their job and get on with it.\n\nMari Rockenstein is an attorney and business law and law and ethics lecturer at CSU Channel Islands.\n\nGreg Schneider/Courtesy of the Center for Individual Rights via AP", "article_metadata": {"title": "Mari Rockenstein: Scotus and the Scalia impact", "og": {"url": "http://www.vcstar.com/opinion/columnists/mari-rockenstein-scotus-and-the-scalia-impact--2e92df73-e165-4751-e053-0100007f06bf-374338191.html", "image": {"width": 900, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/X0013211359--775970.JPG", "height": 798}, "type": "article", "description": "Even before Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s sudden death thrust the Supreme Court into the forefront of the presidential election, the Supreme Court issue was already looming as one of the biggest issues at stake in the 2016 election.", "title": "Mari Rockenstein: Scotus and the Scalia impact"}, "twitter": {"site": "https://twitter.com/vcstar", "image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/X0013211359--775970.JPG", "description": "Even before Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s sudden death thrust the Supreme Court into the forefront of the presidential election, the Supreme Court issue was already looming as one of the biggest issues at stake in the 2016 election.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mari Rockenstein: Scotus and the Scalia impact"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-vcs-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "When the case was argued in January, Scalia and the other conservative justices seemed ready to vote against the unions.\nEven before Justice Antonin Scalia's sudden death thrust the Supreme Court into the forefront of the presidential election, the Supreme Court issue was already looming as one of the biggest issues at stake in the 2016 election.\nMari Rockenstein is an attorney and business law and law and ethics lecturer at CSU Channel Islands.\nAny votes by Scalia on cases already argued and any opinions he was drafting are negated.\nWith several justices in their 80s by the middle of the next presidential term, the 45th president could have up to three Supreme Court vacancies to fill."}
