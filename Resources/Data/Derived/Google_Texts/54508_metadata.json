REUTERS/Larry Downing\n\n4654596\n\nRepublican congressman Ted Yoho \u2014 a veterinarian from Gainesville, Fla. \u2014 says he is fighting a two-front war for his constituents.\n\nThe first one, President Obama\u2019s fundamental transformation and lawlessness, was why he risked everything and ran against an incumbent Republican three years ago, making national news with a surprise primary upset.\n\nThe second battle for those like Yoho is against hostile Republican elites who seem more inclined to accommodate, than stop, Obama\u2019s radical policies. Yoho voted against House Speaker John Boehner twice because his constituents want stronger opposition to Obama\u2019s transformation of America.\n\nHe says there were some 70 Republicans promising to vote no at one time. After the vote, other than being pulled off a fact-finding trip overseas by the speaker of the House, he expects no further blowback. \u201cIf I lived in Russia, I\u2019d worry about that; I would expect that.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI am voicing the concerns of those who sent me up here.\u201d\n\nIn this 27-minute exclusive video interview with The Daily Caller filmed in early June, Yoho discusses that to hold this or any president accountable, Congress has to have courage to \u201cstand up and defend the powers that have been given to the Congress by the Constitution.\u201d\n\nTo refuse to use its powers makes Congress irrelevant, in his opinion.\n\nServing on the Foreign Affairs Committee has given him a front row seat to Obama\u2019s \u201cfailed foreign policy.\u201d Many believe Congress was duped into giving its treaty power away on the Iran deal and some are calling Obama\u2019s efforts to give aid and comfort to an enemy \u201ctreasonous.\u201d Additionally, polls show the deal\u2019s unpopularity is rising.\n\nDiscussing other ways in which Obama is transforming the nation, Yoho mentions our growing debt, broken immigration system, erosion of national sovereignty with Obamatrade, allowing Obama to invade Libya without congressional authorization and Obamacare.\n\nHe says, \u201cover two-thirds of the Republicans came here since 2010 and 90-100 percent of them ran on repealing and replacing Obamacare,\u201d yet no replacement is publicly discussed.\n\nOut of frustration, in April, Yoho introduced H.R. 198 to lay the ground rules to define 11 \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d for any president who should abide by his or her oath to the Constitution. This bill would for any president \u201cchalk the field the day of the game\u201d like a referee would in a football game, he says.\n\nHowever, \u201cthis is not a game; it\u2019s for our country. Enough is enough.\u201d The bill has only two cosponsors right now, as to even raise the concept of impeachment, much less introduce a bill establishing expectations about it, is to challenge the frightened, politically correct Washington culture.\n\nYoho married his wife when they were both 19. He and his wife once spent six months on food stamps after he was laid off. Yoho has worked as a veterinarian for some 30 years before running for Congress. He is willing to reach across the aisle to defend this nation\u2019s founding principles. He defeated a leadership-friendly, Republican incumbent Cliff Stearns in 2012 while being outspent more than four to one.\n\nBesides working hard to meet and listen to citizens, the Florida congressman credits his slogan of \u201cHad Enough?\u201d along with Obama\u2019s extremism and Republican weakness as the factors that propelled him to office.\n\nFor more on Congressman Yoho, here is his website and you can follow him on Twitter at @RepTedYoho and Facebook.\n\nMrs. Thomas does not necessarily support or endorse the products, services or positions promoted in any advertisement contained herein, and does not have control over or receive compensation from any advertiser.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Ginni Thomas", "description": "GOP Congressman: Conservatives Have To Fight A Two-Front War In D.C.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Republican congressman Ted Yoho -- a veterinarian from Gainesville, Fla. -- says he is fighting a two-front war for his constituents.
