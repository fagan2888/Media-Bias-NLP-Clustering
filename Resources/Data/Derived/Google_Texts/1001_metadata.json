Indeed, the General Assembly website has no mention of the session at all. Oh sure, there are all kinds of rumors out there \u2014 the bill will only be about bathrooms; the bill will bar all such anti-discrimination ordinances; the bill will go even further and forbid local living wage ordinances \u2014 but the plain truth is that no one in the public has any idea what will actually be considered and voted on.\n\nThis means that state lawmakers will almost certainly pass an important new law tomorrow that no one in the public has even read before. There will be no chance for meaningful hearings, no time for thoughtful public input, no time to hear from constitutional experts or from the scores of cities across America with similar ordinances.\n\nIf the public is allowed to speak at all, you can rest assured that it will be the usual offensive drill in which a parade of six or eight people will be given a minute of two each to address a packed committee room. It will, in short, be modern North Carolina General Assembly sausage making at its worst \u2014 a hastily convened kangaroo session that will be little better than the gussied-up mob rule one might have expected in some 19th Century frontier territory.\n\nCaring and thinking North Carolinians should be outraged and sickened that such a farce will be carried on in their name and with their tax dollars.\n\nBe sure to check out this afternoon\u2019s edition of the Fitzsimon File for an up-to-the-minute takedown of tomorrow\u2019s hate-fest.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "This means that state lawmakers will almost certainly pass an important new law tomorrow that no one in the public has even read before.\nThere are a lot of reasons to be disgusted that state lawmakers will return to Raleigh tomorrow for a one-day special session to repeal Charlotte\u2019s new anti-discrimination ordinance.\nBe sure to check out this afternoon\u2019s edition of the Fitzsimon File for an up-to-the-minute takedown of tomorrow\u2019s hate-fest.\nIndeed, the General Assembly website has no mention of the session at all.\nIt will, in short, be modern North Carolina General Assembly sausage making at its worst \u2014 a hastily convened kangaroo session that will be little better than the gussied-up mob rule one might have expected in some 19th Century frontier territory."}
