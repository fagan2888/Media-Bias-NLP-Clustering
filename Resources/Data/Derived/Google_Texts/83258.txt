Today's source material:



A new group, Red State Women, launched this week in response to efforts by leftist groups, such as Battleground Texas, to turn the Texas blue after protracted efforts to use abortion as a wedge issue against conservatives [...] Chistman noticed that there was no avenue for conservative women in Texas to express their opinions.

You'd think that conservative women could use, you know,as a venue to express their opinions, but Republicans aren't into that whole "women" thing. Looking at the state's top officeholders , it's 33-3 male to female. And given how few women are represented in other top conservative organization, I guess they had to create a whole new one.

So what will this kickass new organization do?



Red State Women plans to carry out their mission through a social media messaging strategy.

Holy shit, they're going to tweet? That's all one has to do to be part of the right-wing grift machine? Maybe that bar has finally been set a little too low? But hey, let's head below the fold to see just how excited the natives have gotten.
