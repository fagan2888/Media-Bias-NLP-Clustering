President Obama returns Monday from Asian summit meetings to face fierce debates set off by the terrorist attacks in Paris that are raging in living rooms, statehouses, Congress and the presidential campaigns. One issue is whether to send U.S. ground forces to fight the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Another is whether resettling Syrian refugees could open the door to a domestic attack.\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n2. Public transportation was halted in Brussels after the Belgian government raised its threat level to the maximum. France and Belgium, where some of the Paris attackers lived, are moving rapidly to increase state powers and limit privacy and other civil liberties, reigniting the arguments after the 2001 attacks in the U.S. over how to balance security and freedom.\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n3. An attack on a hotel in Mali catering to foreigners expanded the profile of global terrorism. It also revealed a lethal rivalry between the Islamic State, which orchestrated the Paris attacks, and an affiliate of Al Qaeda. \u201cAll the attention has been focused on the Islamic State, Iraq, Syria and threats to the West,\u201d a counterterrorism expert said. \u201cThe guys in Mali saw a big opportunity to remind everyone that they are still relevant.\u201d\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n4. One of Mr. Obama\u2019s more pleasant tasks this week: awarding National Medals of Honor on Monday. Among the 16 recipients of the country\u2019s highest civilian distinction are Steven Spielberg, Barbra Streisand, James Taylor, Stephen Sondheim, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, Shirley Chisholm (one of four posthumous honorees) and the baseball legend Willie Mays, 84, above.\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n5. Amazon started its Black Friday deals a week early. The company has reached a major turning point, beginning to scratch a profit from its online retailing after two decades of laying foundations. \u201cThey\u2019re building a really insurmountable infrastructure that I don\u2019t see how others can really deal with,\u201d an analyst said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe stock market registered its best week of the year, driven upward by gains for retailers and tech companies. But U.S. crude dipped under $40 a barrel for the first time in months.\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n6. Jonathan Pollard, a former Navy analyst convicted of spying for Israel in the late Cold War, was released from a North Carolina prison after serving 30 years. Israel, which regards him as a hero, gave him citizenship 10 years ago, but the terms of his parole preclude him moving there for years. For now, he will live with his wife in Manhattan. His lawyers told a reporter for NPR that he already has a job, at a finance firm.\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n7. In the entertainment world, Carly Simon confirmed what had long been suspected: \u201cYou\u2019re So Vain\u201d is about Warren Beatty \u2014 but only the second verse. She said the rest of the song is about two other men, whose identities she did not reveal. Charlie Sheen made a confession too, but a much more serious one. The troubled actor revealed that he is H.I.V.-positive. \u201cIt is a hard three letters to absorb,\u201d he said.\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n8. Black Lives Matter, a growing political force, focused on more lethal police shootings. In Chicago, the police are expected to comply with a court order to release video showing a white officer shooting a black teenager 16 times last year. In Minneapolis, protesters demand to see video that could show whether a black man was handcuffed when he was fatally shot a week ago.\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n9. Three young Syrian women who were living in the city of Raqqa when the Islamic State took control of it described why they married fighters and joined the group\u2019s female morality police. The horrors of their experiences drove each to flee into hiding in Turkey. \u201cEven if one day things are all right, I will never return to Raqqa,\u201d one said.\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n10. It didn\u2019t take long for the genetically modified salmon the F.D.A. approved for consumption to be labeled \u201cFrankenfish.\u201d But as for official labels, the agency says the fish doesn\u2019t need one. The fast-maturing AquAdvantage salmon is not likely to be found at the grocery store for at least two years.\n\n_______\n\nPhoto\n\n11. Thanksgiving was expected to be more expensive this year after millions of chickens and turkeys in commercial flocks were lost to avian flu. But turkey prices are among the lowest in years, because many of the birds had been harvested before the outbreak, and farmers who weren\u2019t affected stepped up production. Above are candidates for the annual presidential pardon, accompanied by fake Secret Service agents, in San Francisco this month.\n\nHave a great week.\n\n_______\n\nYour Weekend Briefing is published Sundays at 6 a.m. Eastern.\n\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Evening Briefing, weeknights at 6 p.m. Eastern.\n\nWant to look back?
