So I guess that means it won't work, cost a lot of money and kill a bunch of people. But then again you can say that about nearly anything Obama does.

Deputy National Security Adviser and MFA in creative writing Ben Rhodes likened an Iranian nuclear deal to Obamacare in a talk to progressive activists last January, according to audio obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.

Rhodes by the way is considered Suspect #1 in the Chickens__tgate scandal.

“Bottom line is, this is the best opportunity we’ve had to resolve the Iranian issue diplomatically, certainly since President Obama came to office, and probably since the beginning of the Iraq war,” Rhodes said. “So no small opportunity, it’s a big deal. This is probably the biggest thing President Obama will do in his second term on foreign policy. This is healthcare for us, just to put it in context.”

By "resolve", Rhodes means let Iran get the bomb. You can see why Rhodes would want to spend his time smearing Netanyahu since the Israeli leader is the big obstacle to Obama's Iranian bomb campaign.

Rhodes also said the White House wants to avoid congressional scrutiny of any deal. “We’re already kind of thinking through, how do we structure a deal so we don’t necessarily require legislative action right away,” Rhodes said. “And there are ways to do that.”

He is the Ayatollah of Phone and Pen. He's invaded countries without Congress. What's a little thing like unilaterally letting one of the country's worst enemies get a nuclear bomb.
