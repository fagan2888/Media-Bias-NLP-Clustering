When looking at these flies\u2019 RNA \u2014 the nucleic acid present in a fly\u2019s cells \u2014 geneticists found nearly 80 genes were associated with \u201cmorning-ness\u201d and \u201cevening-ness.\u201d In addition, a large number of the genes were associated MAPK, a molecular pathway also present in humans.\n\n\u201cIn this new study, we have used fruit-flies, whose gene clocks are very similar to human, to get a first insight into the molecular basis of \u2018morningness/eveningness\u2019 preference,\u201d Dr. Eran Tauber, study co-author, said in a press release. \u201cBecause this genetic system is so similar between insects and human, there is a good chance that some of the genes that we have identified in flies, would be also important for diurnal preference in humans.\u201d\n\nDr. Ezio Rosato, who led the study, added a key finding was most genes were not \u201ccore-clock genes,\u201d but rather they were genes involved with these molecular pathways. This changes their view of the body\u2019s internal clock, \u201cfrom a pacemaker that drives rhythms to a time reference system that interacts with the environment.\u201d In which case, these findings may be a \u201cstepping stone\u201d towards a better understanding of the exact genes involved with determining a person\u2019s morning and evening activity.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first fruit fly study to have implications for humans. A study published in the journal Nature found when fruit flies lose a gene called \u201ctwenty-four,\u201d they have a harder time waking up; the loss disrupts their sleep-wake cycle. Researchers said the equivalent in humans would be someone who has trouble waking up in the morning.\n\nAs it stands, the circadian clock dictates the sleep-wake cycle. It tells both flies and humans when to get up and be active, and when to rest and sleep. It\u2019s no surprise then cycles thrown off balance are linked to sleep problems, plus conditions like obesity and cardiovascular disease. The more science does to understand what, if any, genes influence morning and evening activity, the more likely it is for experts to develop new, effective therapies for these imbalanced sleep-wake cycles.\n\nOf course, gene expression is only one part of the equation, Tauber said.\n\n\u201cThis difference is largely due to genetic variations in [the flies] DNA sequences \u2014 different gene versions that are present in larks and owls,\u201d he added. \u201cIn another set of experiments, we took advantage of the fact that the DNA sequence of the entire genome of many fly strains in now available. We carried a large survey and identified some interesting genetic variations that are associated with diurnal preference. We are currently analysing the data and hope to publish the results in due course.\u201d\n\nSource: Tauber E, et al.
