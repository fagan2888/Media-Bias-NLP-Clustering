And they say they\u2019ll really put their backs into it.\n\nThe CEOs, whose companies employ a total of some 2 million of the nation\u2019s 130 million workers, say they pledge to play an active and visible role themselves in their companies\u2019 prevention practices to set the example.\n\nOne case: Terry Lundgren, CEO of Macy\u2019s Inc. and a co-chairman of the effort, said he often gets off an elevator a couple of floor below his office and takes stairs the rest of the way. He also participates in a company 5K race.\n\n\u201cIf we can some positive impact on this multi-million group of individuals,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll make a lot of progress.\u201d\n\nThe initiative will focus on improving employee compliance with seven health factors, dubbed Life\u2019s Simple 7 by the AHA. These include smoking status, body mass index, physical activity, healthy eating and measures of cholesterol, high blood pressure and blood sugar.\n\nThe risks are \u201cpreventable and behavior-oriented\u201d and based on scientific research, said Nancy Brown, CEO of the heart association and a co-leader of the effort. Meeting criteria for even three or four of the health indicators can reduce a person\u2019s risk of heart-related death by more than 50%, research suggests.\n\nOne tool leaders expect to prove instrumental to the effort is the ubiquitous smart phone, along with fitness devices and apps that enable consumers to measure and monitor their own health habits.\n\nHenry Kravis, CEO of private-equity company KKR & Co., and co-leader of the initiative says such devices could help enable both individuals and companies track their progress against the health measures. He even envisions companies competing against each other to improve the health-status of their employees.\n\n\u201cNothing succeeds like some competition and incentives\u201d to help achieve such goals, he said.\n\nCEOs from Merck & Co., Humana Inc., CVS Caremark Corp. and Kaiser Permanente, the big California-based health plan are among other participants. The group plans to recruit more members.\n\nPart of workplace health is helping workers find a balance between work and family life. Merck CEO Ken Frazier said one way he sets an example is by regularly taking time off between noon on Saturday and 4 p.m. Sunday.\n\nAP\n\nIn announcing the effort Tuesday, the AHA and 22 CEOs that comprise the American Heart Association CEO Roundtable released results of a survey that suggests employees of U.S. companies overestimate how healthy they are, potentially putting them at higher risk for cardiovascular and other diseases than they think.\n\nThe survey of 2,004 U.S. workers conducted by roundtable member Nielsen Co. found that 74% considered themselves in good or very good health, but of those, 42% had actually been diagnosed with a chronic condition such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes.\n\nPeople with such preexisting conditions can be expensive to insure, and under the Affordable Care Act, insurers can no longer refuse coverage because of a person\u2019s their health.\n\nBruce Broussard, CEO of Humana, said that makes it especially important for insurers to support workplace health programs, both inside their companies and among the broader population. For insurers, the idea now is \u201chow can you keep people healthier, as opposed to finding the people who are healthier,\u201d Mr. Broussard said. \u201cThat\u2019s an upside-down insurance product.\u201d\n\nThe survey also found that employees who believe top level managers support participation in workplace prevention programs at work are nearly twice as likely to report improved health. Without CEO involvement, employees see the programs only as a cost-saving strategy.\n\nEmployees cite such workplace wellness programs as important to job satisfaction, recruitment and retention, especially when top management are involved and encourage participation, the survey found.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The leaders of more than 20 big companies, employing 2 million people, are teaming up to help employees quit smoking, lose weight and meet other vital health metrics.", "title": "Why the CEO of Macy\u2019s Takes the Stairs", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/07/08/ceos-name-a-new-corporate-priority-healthy-workers/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BT855_0304tr_G_20140304161910.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Why the CEO of Macy\u2019s Takes the Stairs", "description": "The leaders of more than 20 big companies, employing 2 million people, are teaming up to help employees quit smoking, lose weight and meet other vital health metrics.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Ron Winslow", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "The leaders of more than 20 big companies, employing 2 million people, are teaming up to help employees quit smoking, lose weight and meet other vital health metrics.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-07-08T18:09:57-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/07/08/ceos-name-a-new-corporate-priority-healthy-workers/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-5068", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The leaders of more than 20 big companies, employing 2 million people, are teaming up to help employees quit smoking, lose weight and meet other vital health metrics.", "title": "Why the CEO of Macy\u2019s Takes the Stairs", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/07/08/ceos-name-a-new-corporate-priority-healthy-workers/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BT855_0304tr_G_20140304161910.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-5068", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-08T23:12:32-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd15df\"", "article_summary": "One case: Terry Lundgren, CEO of Macy\u2019s Inc. and a co-chairman of the effort, said he often gets off an elevator a couple of floor below his office and takes stairs the rest of the way.\nBruce Broussard, CEO of Humana, said that makes it especially important for insurers to support workplace health programs, both inside their companies and among the broader population.\nPart of workplace health is helping workers find a balance between work and family life.\nWithout CEO involvement, employees see the programs only as a cost-saving strategy.\nThe risks are \u201cpreventable and behavior-oriented\u201d and based on scientific research, said Nancy Brown, CEO of the heart association and a co-leader of the effort."}
