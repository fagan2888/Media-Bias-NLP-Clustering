The company is growing at the rate of 30-35 per cent annually.\n\n\n\nGopi Natarajan, co-founder and CEO of Omega Healthcare, tells BW | Businessworld's Haider Ali Khan about the company's future strategy and expansion plan. Edited excerpts:\n\n\n\nOn Omega Healthcare\n\nOmega Healthcare is the premier offshore provider of healthcare outsourcing services, specializing in revenue cycle management (RCM). With the vision of becoming a global leader in the sector, Omega started its operations in 2004 and currently has close to 10,000 employees across its four facilities - Bangalore, Chennai, Trichy and Manila (Philippines) and is looking to expand its workforce with 1,500 more employees by next quarter. The organisation handles revenue cycle management and related work for large US-based healthcare providers. We are growing at a rate of 30 per cent to 35 per cent annually and is almost in line with the industry growth rate of 35 per cent to 40 per cent.\n\n\n\nOn medical coding in India after ICD-10\n\nMedical coding is mainly associated with allocating standardised numeric and alphanumeric codes for different medical diagnosis, procedures and supplies, documented in the patient\u2019s medical record by healthcare providers. It has emerged as one of the exciting career opportunities for healthcare professionals \u2013 medics and paramedics across the globe.\n\n\n\nIndian healthcare BPO sector is witnessing a sharp increase in medical coding requirement from US. The healthcare industry there, in the recent months, underwent a massive migration from ICD-9 to ICD-10 coding system, the tenth revision of WHO\u2019s International Classification of Diseases (ICD). This development has easily brought about 30 per cent increase in opportunities, with US healthcare providers more open to off shoring now, due to shortage of coders there. The employment opportunities for medical coders who are able to work on the new complicated coding system is growing rapidly.\n\n\n\nWith this, the healthcare BPO sector is hiring trained, efficient and certified coders in huge numbers. Both Obamacare and migration to ICD-10 will provide opportunities similar to the shift that took place in the beginning of the century, with the number of medical coders in the country expected to double in the coming 2-3 years.\n\n\n\nHousing 15,000 \u2013 16,000 coders, India has the second largest pool of medical coders after the US, and 70 per cent of them are already trained in ICD-10.\n\n\n\nOn Obamacare and ICD-10\n\nObamacare and ICD-10 implementation has opened up vast opportunities for the healthcare BPO industry in the country with huge demand for certified medical coders as India continues to secure a major portion of the outsourced pie compared to other countries.\n\n\n\nWith this new regulation, accurate identification of diseases and reimbursement of health insurance claims will be more complex as the number of codes have increased from 16,000 (ICD-9) to 1,25,000 (ICD-10). This work requires high levels of skill from trained and experienced coders.\n\n\n\nWe at Omega Healthcare are fully prepared to handle assignments with the new coding system and 100 per cent of our coders are fully trained to handle the ICD-10 related work.\n\n\n\nOn Omega Medical Coding Academy\n\nOmega Medical Coding Academy (OMCA) was created to leverage the vast experience we had at Omega Healthcare Management Services to benefit interested students and the industry as a whole. It is the \u2018first-of-its-kind\u2019 business-academia collaboration to provide training for deserving candidates to become high-calibre professional medical coders to serve this fast growth sector.\n\n\n\nHaving trained and placed 1,000 coders, absorbing most of them, since its inception last year, OMCA stands as a reputed medical coding resource provider to the industry. Eligibility criteria for the training programme include any medical, para-medical or graduates/post-graduates in life-sciences and allied subjects.\n\n\n\nOMCA is operational at Chennai and Trichy for now. We are planning to launch it in Bangalore this year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Gopi Natarajan, co-founder and CEO of Omega Healthcare, tells BW | Businessworld's Haider Ali Khan about the company's future strategy and expansion plan, , Omega Healthcare, obamacare, Healthcare BPO industry, Gopi Natarajan", "keyword": ", Omega Healthcare, obamacare, Healthcare BPO industry, Gopi Natarajan", "title": "Obamacare and ICD 10 Opened New Vistas For Healthcare BPO Industry  - BW Businessworld", "og": {"site_name": "BW Businessworld", "description": "Gopi Natarajan, co-founder and CEO of Omega Healthcare, tells BW | Businessworld's Haider Ali Khan about the company's future strategy and expansion plan, , Omega Healthcare, obamacare, Healthcare BPO industry, Gopi Natarajan", "title": "Obamacare and ICD 10 Opened New Vistas For Healthcare BPO Industry", "url": "http://businessworld.in/article/-Obamacare-and-ICD-10-Opened-New-Vistas-For-Healthcare-BPO-Industry-/19-01-2016-90435", "image": "http://d1s8mqgwixvb29.cloudfront.net/article/article_large_image/1453221768_avmzqb_gopi.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 726601580803263}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Gopi Natarajan, co-founder and CEO of Omega Healthcare, tells BW | Businessworld's Haider Ali Khan about the company's future strategy and expansion plan.\nOn Omega Medical Coding AcademyOmega Medical Coding Academy (OMCA) was created to leverage the vast experience we had at Omega Healthcare Management Services to benefit interested students and the industry as a whole.\nThe healthcare industry there, in the recent months, underwent a massive migration from ICD-9 to ICD-10 coding system, the tenth revision of WHO\u2019s International Classification of Diseases (ICD).\nEdited excerpts:On Omega HealthcareOmega Healthcare is the premier offshore provider of healthcare outsourcing services, specializing in revenue cycle management (RCM).\nIndian healthcare BPO sector is witnessing a sharp increase in medical coding requirement from US."}
