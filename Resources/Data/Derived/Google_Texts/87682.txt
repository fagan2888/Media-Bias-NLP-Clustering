Two people are dead after an overnight shooting at a recreational facility in Choctaw County.

The shooting happened about 2:00 Saturday morning at the Jimmerson Family Home in north Choctaw County, just off of Highway 17. Sheriff Tom Abate says a birthday party was taking place there when gunshots suddenly rang out. As one of the victims was being transported to the hospital, the vehicle he was traveling in was involved in a serious crash on Highway 17.

"We have a lot of leads," Sheriff Abate points out. "And this is just the beginning in the investigation. We've got a long way to go, but all the agencies involved are working real close together. We're pretty sure we're going to end this pretty well."

The victim's names have not yet been released. The suspects vehicle was recovered, but the suspects are still at large.
