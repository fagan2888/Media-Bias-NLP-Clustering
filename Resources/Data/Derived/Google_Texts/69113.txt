BALTIMORE (AP) â€” After a pair of postponements caused by rioting in Baltimore, the Orioles and Chicago White Sox will play Wednesday at Camden Yards in what is believed to be the first game without fans in major league baseball's 145-season history.

Because of the unsettled environment in Baltimore, where rioters burned a drug store and set police cars ablaze on Monday night, officials moved the game up five hours from its original 7:05 p.m. starting time and closed it to the public.

In addition, Baltimore's Friday-to-Sunday series against Tampa Bay was shifted from Camden Yards to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida, with Baltimore remaining the home team and batting last.

"It's all about what's best for the city and the safety of our people," Orioles manager Buck Showalter said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. "The last thing you want to do is put the fans in harm's way. You have to err on the side of safety."

Schools were closed Tuesday and the mayor imposed a 10 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew. The announcement of the unique closed-doors game came late Tuesday afternoon, after the Orioles postponed games against Chicago on Monday and Tuesday.

"We were just trying to respond to the wishes of the public officials and protect the integrity of the schedule," Dan Duquette, the Orioles executive vice president of baseball operations, said in a phone interview.
