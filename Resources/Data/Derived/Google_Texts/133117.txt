Lakeland Regional Medical Centerâ€™s plan to launch a medical residency program could hinge on a meeting between hospital leadership and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator today, the Lakeland Ledger reports.

The meeting in Washington D.C. with Marilyn Tavenner will focus on a year-long dispute concerning residents who served at LRMC as part of other programs, the Ledger reports.

The hospital wants to run its own residency program, which could lead to about $30 million a year in federal money, the Ledger reports. Medicare maintains its contribution for residents at Lakeland should be about $300,000 per year, according to the Ledger.
