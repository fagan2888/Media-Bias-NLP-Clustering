Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), a conservative torchbearer and potential presidential contender, turned his attention to local D.C. politics Wednesday by introducing a measure in Congress to upend one new city law regarding discrimination over reproductive health decisions and another to keep religiously affiliated colleges in the nation\u2019s capital from having to fund gay and lesbian student groups.\n\nThe measures, known as disapproval resolutions, could in theory halt local laws passed last year by the D.C. Council and signed by the city\u2019s mayor. But to do so, Cruz\u2019s measures would require support of both chambers of Congress and the signature of President Obama.\n\nAlthough rarely successful at stopping D.C. laws, the resolutions are often more effective politically, giving members of Congress legislative records to build bona fides with constituent groups that feel strongly about the District\u2019s often liberal stances on social issues.\n\nOn the two issues at hand, there are more than a few with strong feelings.\n\nLast month, more than a dozen prominent conservative groups and Catholic institutions asked Capitol Hill leaders to overturn the two D.C. laws, calling them \u201cunprecedented assaults upon our organizations.\u201d\n\n[Conservative and Catholic groups urge members of Congress to reject D.C. bills]\n\nThe laws would restrict the ability of private groups to discriminate based on religious beliefs. One, the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act of 2014, would prevent employers from taking action against workers based on their decision to use birth control or seek an abortion. The other, the Human Rights Amendment Act of 2014, repeals a longstanding, congressionally imposed measure exempting religiously affiliated educational institutions from the city\u2019s gay nondiscrimination law.\n\nAs is the case for all D.C. laws, the two are now under a mandatory 30-day review period before Congress. Without congressional action, they could take effect as early as next month. That happened last month with the city\u2019s marijuana-legalization law, when, despite threats from House Republicans, no lawmaker introduced a measure to stop it. Some Republicans feared a vote on marijuana legalization could expose a rift between conservative and libertarian wings of the party.\n\nAsked about the measures Wednesday while walking through the U.S. Capitol, Cruz referred questions to his office, which did not immediately respond to a phone call and e-mail seeking comment.\n\nFreshman Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), who co-introduced the measures, issued a statement Wednesday saying \u201cwhat the D.C. Council has done is a major threat to the fundamental right to religious freedom for D.C. residents and organizations, and a brazen display of intolerance.\u201d\n\nAs evidence that Congress would be within its rights to disapprove the D.C. measures, Lankford pointed to a Supreme Court decision last year that family-owned businesses do not have to offer their employees contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act if doing so conflicts with owners\u2019 religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cLast summer\u2019s Supreme Court decision affirmed the right to live and work in accordance with your convictions. In America, a person can choose a lifestyle of any faith or no faith at all \u2014 that\u2019s religious freedom,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cWashington, D.C., residents and organizations shouldn\u2019t be discriminated from enjoying those same rights.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Kimberly Perry, head of D.C. Vote, an organization that lobbies for voting representation for the District in Congress, criticized the effort as counter to Republicans\u2019 belief in greater states\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cSenators Cruz and Lankford\u2019s move to disapprove a local District law is absurd and hypocritical,\u201d Perry said. \u201cThey are now guilty of the same federal overreach they often criticize in others.\u201d\n\nPerry called on \u201cevery other member of Congress to step up and see this for exactly what it is \u2014 un-American and un-democratic.\u201d\n\nThe letter last month opposing the proposed D.C. laws was signed by leaders of Heritage Action for America, the Family Research Council and the National Organization for Marriage, as well as representatives from the Catholic University of America,the Archdiocese of Washington and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.\n\nConservative commentators have sharply criticized both bills, particularly the human rights measure, which would repeal the 1989 \u201cArmstrong Amendment\u201d passed in response to a lawsuit filed under the D.C. Human Rights Act to compel Georgetown University to recognize a gay student group. Georgetown, notably, was not among the signers of the new letter.\n\nThe D.C. Council this month attempted to head off some of the brewing controversy over the bills. The council passed an emergency amendment to the reproductive health law to clarify that employers could not be forced to provide insurance coverage for contraception and abortions that they oppose on religious grounds.\n\nThe council initially had said the amendment was unnecessary because that was made clear last year by the Supreme Court, but the fix to the bill was pushed by D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D).\n\n[D.C. mayor ratchets down marijuana fight with leaders in Congress]\n\nReferring to the Cruz measure to upend the abortion-related law, Bowser spokesman Michael Czin said that because District residents have no vote in Congress, the mayor intends to work with allies in Congress and the president \u201cto stave off this intrusion into private discussions between doctors and their patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom fixing our broken immigration system to investing in our nation\u2019s ailing infrastructure, there are numerous issues that deserve the attention of members of Congress. The District of Columbia\u2019s legislative process should not be one of them,\u201d a statement from the mayor said.\n\nReligious groups were more pleased Wednesday. \u201cThese bills are serious violations of religious freedoms,\u201d said Casey Mattox, senior counsel with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group. \u201cWe are pleased members of Congress are taking them seriously.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Measures known as disapproval resolutions could in theory halt laws passed by the city council.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/madebonis", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Measures known as disapproval resolutions could in theory halt laws passed by the city council.", "title": "Sen.
