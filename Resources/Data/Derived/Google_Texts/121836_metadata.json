The government announced $150 million in new grants to community health centers like Mary's Center. John Brecher\n\nThe federal government announced Thursday it will give community health centers $150 million to help hire more staff, buy equipment and rent space to treat more than a million new patients.\n\n\n\nThe grants are meant to help the health centers absorb some of the people expected to start seeking care \u2014 many for the first time \u2014 as they gain health insurance under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThis allows health centers to hire physicians, nurse practitioners, medical assistants to expand their capacity to be able to provide services to new patients,\u201d said Mary Wakefield, administration of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).\n\nThe cash will support 236 health centers across the country, Wakefield told reporters in a conference call, allowing them to add 1.25 million new patients.\n\nThere are about 1,200 federally qualified community health centers across the country. They started out as grassroots organizations, and in 1965, the federal government started giving them money when it became clear they were filling gaps in the messy U.S. health care system.\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department estimates they provide care now to 21 million people.\n\n\u201cSince the beginning of 2009, health centers have added 4 million patients and more than 35,000 new full-time positions,\u201d HRSA, which falls under HHS, said in a statement.\n\nHHS looks to them not only to fill gaps in coverage, but as centers where people who need help the most can learn about the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that could make them eligible for heavily subsidized health insurance, or coverage under Medicaid.\n\n\n\nGroups such as the Association of American Medical Colleges project a shortage of 90,000 medical doctors by 2020 as the population increases and ages \u2014 and as more people gain the ability to pay for treatment through new insurance marketplaces and expanded Medicaid programs.\n\n\n\n\u201cHealth centers are key partners in the improving access to quality, affordable health care services for those who need it most. With new, affordable health insurance options available under the Affordable Care Act, community health centers are also key partners in helping uninsured residents sign up for health coverage \u2014 many of whom have been locked out of the health insurance market for years,\u201d HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government announced Thursday it will give community health centers $150 million to help hire more staff, buy equipment and rent space to treat more than a million new patients.The grants are meant to help the health centers absorb some of the people expected to start seeking care \u2014 many for the first time \u2014 as they gain health insurance under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/health/feds-give-health-centers-150-million-treat-1-25-million-8C11547241", "type": "article", "image": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/streams/2013/november/131107/8c9614131-131106-health-center-4x3-712p.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "site_name": "NBC News", "description": "The federal government announced Thursday it will give community health centers $150 million to help hire more staff, buy equipment and rent space to treat more than a million new patients.The grants are meant to help the health centers absorb some of the people expected to start seeking care \u2014 many for the first time \u2014 as they gain health insurance under the 2010 Affordable Care Act."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "The federal government announced Thursday it will give community health centers $150 million to help hire more staff, buy equipment and rent space to treat more than a million new patients.The grants are meant to help the health centers absorb some of the people expected to start seeking care \u2014 many for the first time \u2014 as they gain health insurance under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": {"src": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/streams/2013/november/131107/8c9614131-131106-health-center-4x3-712p.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "title": "Feds give health centers $150 million to treat 1.25 million new patients - NBC News", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-07", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/feds-give-health-centers-150-million-treat-1-25-million-8C11547241", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Health,Health Care"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ce4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHealth centers are key partners in the improving access to quality, affordable health care services for those who need it most.\nThe government announced $150 million in new grants to community health centers like Mary's Center.\nJohn BrecherThe federal government announced Thursday it will give community health centers $150 million to help hire more staff, buy equipment and rent space to treat more than a million new patients.\nThere are about 1,200 federally qualified community health centers across the country.\nThe cash will support 236 health centers across the country, Wakefield told reporters in a conference call, allowing them to add 1.25 million new patients."}
