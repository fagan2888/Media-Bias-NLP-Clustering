That's in addition to the 2.2 million who had already enrolled in 2014 as part of the health-law expansion.\n\nMedi-Cal enrollment is open year-round.\n\nThis week, Covered California extended its deadline for Jan. 1 coverage and renewals to Sunday, Dec. 21. The cut-off had been Dec. 15.\n\nPeter Lee, the exchange's executive director, said the state didn't grant the extension because of problems with online enrollment or long wait times -- which has been the case in the past.\n\nInstead, he pointed to 157,000 people who have completed the application process but have yet to finish by picking out a health plan.\n\n\"The [information technology] systems are working great, but insurance is confusing,\" Lee said. \"Many consumers signing up today are new to health insurance and we know they need help.\"\n\nAnother improvement this year is that many consumers are able to pay their first monthly premium online when using the state website.\n\nCovered California and several of its participating health plans added that payment feature to alleviate earlier problems when people were left waiting weeks to get their first bill and confirmation of coverage.\n\nLee said that about half of the 144,000 new enrollees have already paid online.\n\nTwitter: @chadterhune", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "New Obamacare enrollments in California top 144,000", "date": "2014-12-17", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "California's health insurance exchange said 144,178 people have newly enrolled in Obamacare coverage during the first month of sign ups.", "title": "New Obamacare enrollments in California top 144,000", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/business/healthcare/la-fi-obamacare-covered-california-20141217-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5491cbf6/turbine/la-fi-obamacare-covered-california-20141217", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, covered california", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/82318088", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "obamacare, affordable care act, covered california", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "California's health insurance exchange said 144,178 people have newly enrolled in Obamacare coverage during the first month of sign ups.
