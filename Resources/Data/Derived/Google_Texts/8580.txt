WASHINGTON (CBS DC) — A new poll finds that President Barack Obama has been rated the biggest failure as commander in chief since 1900.

A YouGov/Economist survey reveals that 37 percent of Americans believe Obama has been a failure during his time in office, worse than Richard Nixon. Thirty-two percent of Americans believed former President George W. Bush was a failure, followed up by Nixon at 30 percent. Jimmy Carter came in fourth at 22 percent.

More Americans considered Ronald Reagan a great president since 1900, coming in at 32 percent. Reagan was followed by Franklin Roosevelt at 31 percent, John F. Kennedy at 30 percent and then Bill Clinton rounding out the top four at 27 percent.

Obama has been battered in the polls recently thanks in part to the disastrous rollout of his health care law. A CBS News poll released last week found that Obama’s disapproval rating is 57 percent, his highest level ever. Only 37 percent of Americans approve of the job he is currently doing.

The survey interviewed 1,000 American adults between Oct. 26-28.
