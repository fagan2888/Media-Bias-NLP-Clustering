Looking back to the 2004 cycle, the pair donated $40,500 to Democrats and only $17,250 to the GOP.\n\nA large share of Trump\u2019s donations to Democrats were given to congressional committees dedicated specifically to gaining majority control of Congress. And that they did. Democrats took control of both houses of Congress for the first time since 1994 by gaining 31 seats in the House and increasing the Democratic caucus in the Senate by six.\n\nRecords show that in June 2006, Trump donated $20,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. That was in addition to the $5,000 he sent in April 2005 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. At the same time, Trump Jr. gave the two Democratic committees a total of $22,500.\n\nWhile the Trumps spent nearly $50,000 to elect congressional Democrats, they donated only $1,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRSC).\n\nBut perhaps the worst outcome that election for Republicans was that Pelosi and Reid became Speaker of the House and Senate Majority Leader, respectively. The pair made a formidable team and did heavy lifting to ensure that Obama was elected in 2008 and that much of his agenda \u2014 including Obamacare \u2014 was put in place.\n\nIf Trump does choose to run \u2014 a decision on which he will announce on June 16 \u2014 he\u2019ll face a field of 15-plus Republican hopefuls. He\u2019ll also be fighting almost immediately for the life of his campaign. The Republican National Committee has changed its rules this cycle by limiting party debates to the top 10 hopefuls in the polls. The party is taking the unprecedented move in order to limit exposure to dark horse candidates.\n\nTrump finished eighth in a Quinnipiac poll released last week. The first debate will be held Aug. 6 and will be hosted by Fox News.\n\nIf Trump makes that debate stage and if he becomes a big enough threat to primary front-runners \u2014 former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker \u2014 his past support the GOP\u2019s mortal political foes will almost certainly become the topic of debate.\n\nTopping the flamboyant former TV celebrity\u2019s roster of Democratic benefactors is scandal-plagued New York U.S. Rep. Charlie Rangel. Records show the Harlem-based Democrat has received $26,250 in Trump cash since 1989. Trump Jr., has given heavily to Rangel as well.\n\nNew York Sens. Kristen Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer have received $7,950 and $7,900, respectively, in Trump money. And two liberal lions, former Massachusetts Sens. John Kerry and Ted Kennedy, received $5,500 and $5,000.\n\nTrump also arguably helped enable Obamacare in another way \u2014 albeit before the health law was a twinkle in any liberal\u2019s eye. Trump supported two of its most ardent supporters in Reid and New York U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner. He donated $7,400 to the Nevada Democrat. Among those contributions is $2,400 Trump gave Reid ahead of his contentious 2010 run against Sharron Angle, a tea party favorite.\n\nTrump also gave $4,300 to Weiner, a dogged supporter of Obamacare who was forced to resign his seat following a sexting scandal.\n\nSince its passage, Trump has called Obamacare \u201ca filthy lie\u201d and said that it would shut down the country. Though Obamacare was not on the radar when Trump made his donations, Democrats have long sought centralized control of the American health care system.\n\nBut perhaps most damaging to Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 if he chooses to embark on one \u2014 is the money he\u2019s given to Hillary Clinton and other Clinton family endeavors. Trump donated more than $4,100 to the likely Democratic nominee in 2002, 2005, 2006 and 2007, records show. Trump Jr. gave the former first lady $6,100 in 2006 and 2007.\n\nThose donations pale in comparison to other support Trump has given the Clinton empire. It was recently revealed that he gifted the Clinton Foundation at least $100,000, according to the Clinton Foundation website. The always outspoken Trump defended the donation, saying that the Clintons \u201ckissed [his] ass\u201d for the dough.\n\nTrump\u2019s donations to high-profile Democrats isn\u2019t limited to those on the national stage. Not included in the Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 database is a $50,000 contribution Trump gave in December 2010 to former Bill Clinton and Obama White House official Rahm Emanuel for his successful Chicago mayoral bid.\n\nPerhaps atoning for what many Republican primary voters will consider to be grave political sins \u2014 donating to Reid, Clinton, and Schumer, who has been tapped to lead Senate Democrats when Reid retires \u2014 Trump has contributed $358,700 exclusively to Republicans since 2011, mostly in large-dollar donations to political action committees.\n\nIt was around that time that Trump became a vocal critic of Obama\u2019s and began seeking information about his birth certificate. The aggressive approach helped win Trump solid support among some conservatives.\n\nBefore 2011, Trump\u2019s $290,600 in donations to Republicans went to a smattering of candidates, many of whom were from his home state of New York.\n\nRecords show Trump contributed $8,600 to Arizona Sen. John McCain, mostly for his 2008 presidential run. His second-biggest GOP benefactor wasn\u2019t exactly a conservative stalwart. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter received $8,300 from Trump between 1989 and 2008 \u2014 the year before Specter switched parties.\n\nIn 2010, Trump, who was a registered Democrat between 2001 and 2008, gave $50,000 to the Karl Rove-backed super PAC, American Crossroads. In 2012 he gave $100,000 to the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aimed at getting Republicans elected to the House.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Chuck Ross", "description": "Records show Donald Trump has been a heavy Democratic donor.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "While it has been an open secret for several years that Donald Trump was once a heavy Democratic donor, a deeper analysis of campaign records shows that the real estate billionaire's contributions ske", "title": "Donald Trump Donated Heavily To Democrats, Especially During Election Which Put Reid And Pelosi In Power", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/06/03/donald-trump-donated-heavily-to-democrats-especially-during-election-which-put-reid-and-pelosi-in-power/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/494048401-e1401725285344.jpg", "height": 516}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump leaned left until 2011", "creator": "@@ChuckRossDC", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/06/03/donald-trump-donated-heavily-to-democrats-especially-during-election-which-put-reid-and-pelosi-in-power/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/494048401-e1401725285344.jpg"}, "title": "Donald Trump Donated Heavily To Democrats, Especially During Election Which Put Reid And Pelosi In Power Via @dailycaller", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-03 00:08:20", "sailthru.title": "Donald Trump Donated Heavily To Democrats, Especially During Election Which Put Reid And Pelosi In Power", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "keywords": "donald trump,elections 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "sailthru.tags": "donald-trump,elections-2016,chuck-ross", "sailthru.description": "While it has been an open secret for several years that Donald Trump was once a heavy Democratic donor, a deeper analysis of campaign records shows that the real estate billionaire's contributions ske", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/494048401-e1401725285344.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Overall in the 2006 election cycle, Trump and his son, Donald Trump Jr., donated $77,200 to Democrats versus only $24,250 on Republicans.\nRecords show that in June 2006, Trump donated $20,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\nAmong those contributions is $2,400 Trump gave Reid ahead of his contentious 2010 run against Sharron Angle, a tea party favorite.\nWhile the Trumps spent nearly $50,000 to elect congressional Democrats, they donated only $1,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRSC).\nTrump donated more than $4,100 to the likely Democratic nominee in 2002, 2005, 2006 and 2007, records show."}
