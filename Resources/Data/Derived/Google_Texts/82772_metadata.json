Rep. Ray Pilon decided to forgo a 2016 re-election bid for a fourth term in the House in favor of a Senate District 28 campaign, leaving his Democratic opponent Edward James running unopposed in a coastal swing seat.\n\nPilon said Tuesday his decision came from the resolution of Senate maps and local considerations. Sarasota Republican Party Chairman Joe Gruters declared publicly last year Pilon would not seek the seat when rumors first emerged, but Pilon said that contradicted his camp\u2019s internal thinking.\n\n\u201cWe were honestly contemplating it (then),\u201d Pilon said. \u201cWe saw what the maps were, took time to explore it and network it and made our decision.\u201d\n\nPilon expressed confidence he would have beaten James had he remained in the House District 72 race. However, since the initial Senate rumors James has proven a more viable House challenger than many expected.\n\nSince filing this past summer James has amassed $243,222 overall \u2013 $166,650 of that coming through an affiliated committee which added $50,000 in February \u2013 far more than any previous Democratic opponent had raised at this point in the cycle.\n\nPilon has broken with House leadership on a number of issues in recent years, including \u201copen carry\u201d legislation and a Senate-driven plan to expand Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act. That could be attributed to both his interest in the Senate and the concerns of his moderate district, Pilon said.\n\n\u201cI try to put the people I represent before politics, which is often difficult to do. But I have succeeded,\u201d said Pilon, who is set to term-out in 2018.\n\nHe added, however: \u201cWith my last two years in the House, with the way they\u2019re going, I felt I could accomplish more of the things I wanted to accomplish in a smaller body.\u201d\n\nThe third-term legislator said he would file paperwork for the seat by next week and that he was always serious about a Senate run, even signing a pledge card for Sen. Jack Latvala\u2018s now-defunct Senate presidency bid.\n\nPilon also expressed confidence Republicans would recruit a competitive candidate to defeat James and keep the seat in the \u2018R\u2019 column.\n\nJames, meanwhile, said Pilon\u2019s exit puts him in a strong position to succeed him in the district.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Representative Pilon for his service to Sarasota,\u201d James said. \u201cAs our next representative, I\u2019ll make sure Sarasota continues to have a strong voice in Tallahassee.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether the move makes James the \u201cpresumptive\u201d winner, he said he would avoid using that term.\n\n\u201cBut I will say that with no opponent, it would certainly appear we are in a position to serve the community in an official capacity,\u201d said James, adding he does not intend to slow down on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cWith an opponent or without an opponent, we still believe that folks in Sarasota deserve to find out why a new direction is going to help the district and the state of Florida move forward,\u201d James said in a nod to his \u201cNew Direction\u201d committee and campaign mantra.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re still going to be out there campaigning, we\u2019re still going to be knocking on doors and still talking to voters. So if folks haven\u2019t seen us out in the community yet, they certainly will.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "A pair of Sarasota legislative races saw major changes this past weekend.
