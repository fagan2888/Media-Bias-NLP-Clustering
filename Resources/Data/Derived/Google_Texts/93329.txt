Spotlight on… Patrick Kane, right wing, Blackhawks

When: The Avalanche plays the Blackhawks for the first time this season Wednesday at the Pepsi Center, the second of back-to-back games for the Avs.

What’s up: Patrick Kane is off to another fine start at age 26. He scored a dazzling goal Thursday to help the Blackhawks beat the Calgary Flames and has maintained close to a point-per-game average.

Background: A native of Buffalo, N.Y., Kane was the No. 1 pick in the 2007 NHL draft and has helped Chicago win two Stanley Cups. He scored the overtime goal that gave Chicago the Cup in 2009. He is a colorful player and personality, and has cleaned up his reputation since some off-ice incidents early in his career.

Dater’s take: Kane has been a top NHL player for a while, though it’s surprising that he has scored 30 goals in a season only once in his career. He can be streaky but always seems to bring it in the biggest games. Kane and Jonathan Toews signed long-term contract extensions last season and figure to torture NHL goalies for a long time. Kane’s stick-handling ability might be the best in the league.
