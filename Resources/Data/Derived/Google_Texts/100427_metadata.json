Moments earlier, No. 86 had told the judge it would be hard to listen to evidence in the case and not wonder what could have been if her child had been in the theater that night.\n\nNow, the judge had come to the crux of the jury selection process, and he looked at No. 86.\n\n\u201cIf selected for this case, can you be a fair and impartial juror?\u201d he asked.\n\nShe paused.\n\n\u201cI would like to believe that I could be objective,\u201d she responded. \u201cI do believe I can do that.\u201d\n\nShe passed.\n\nThrough three days of individual questioning of potential jurors, the judge and attorneys in the Aurora theater shooting trial have approved 16 jurors for the final stage of jury selection. That is exactly half of the jurors questioned, and at a rate far better than anyone predicted.\n\nOne reason for the success has been the number of jurors who said \u2014 in response to questions by the judge or the attorneys \u2014 that they can set aside their personal beliefs and preconceptions to decide the case impartially. In legal terms, such questioning is known as \u201crehabilitating\u201d jurors. Essentially, it\u2019s taking somewhat biased jurors and persuading them to act like unbiased ones.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unusual,\u201d said Denver defense attorney and legal analyst Dan Recht. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nBut the process is also controversial. While some research suggests that rehabilitation can change the way jurors view cases, several states have limited its use. Skeptics say rehabilitation potentially allows jurors to slip into cases that they can\u2019t decide fairly.\n\nWhen sitting in a courtroom and asked by a judge or a lawyer whether they can be impartial, most people will answer yes, said Jessica Brylo, a Denver-based trial consultant. They either want to be seen as fair \u2014 \u201cI would do my 100 percent best to be open-minded about it because that\u2019s the kind of person I am,\u201d juror No. 86 said during questioning \u2014 or they are afraid of giving a \u201cwrong\u201d answer. But, once seated for a jury, it is hard for jurors to keep their biases from seeping back in.\n\n\u201cTo say you can set your beliefs aside is psychologically impossible,\u201d Brylo wrote in an e-mail. \u201cResearch has shown time and again that jurors are not blank slates but rather come to the table with a set of beliefs and biases.\u201d\n\nIn the theater shooting case, Judge Carlos Samour repeatedly has told jurors, \u201cThere are no right or wrong answers, only honest answers.\u201d And jurors have been dismissed after saying they could not set aside strongly held beliefs.\n\nBut both sides also have objected to jurors whom Samour has declined to dismiss.\n\nOn Thursday, defense attorney Kristen Nelson said the judge\u2019s questioning, in particular, was making jurors less likely to be honest about their biases.\n\n\u201cRight out of the box, they feel they need to tell the court what the court wants to hear,\u201d she said.\n\nSamour responded firmly that he was just doing his job, trying to weed out biased jurors and to instruct others how to decide the case impartially.\n\nJury selection has been especially complicated because prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against James Holmes, a potential punishment that jurors would have to render. Jurors selected for the trial also must be open to sentencing Holmes to life in prison or to finding him not guilty by reason of insanity on charges that he murdered 12 people and tried to kill 70 others.\n\n\u201cGenerally,\u201d Samour said, \u201cwe don\u2019t have juries do sentencing. We have judges do sentencing. That\u2019s what makes this difficult. That\u2019s why we have to educate them about how to do sentencing.\u201d\n\nIn the theater shooting case, rehabilitation of jurors has worked both ways. On Thursday, a juror who broke down in tears when asked whether she could give a life sentence in the case, knowing that one of the victims was a child, was retained when she said she could be fair. Later in the day, a juror who wrote on her questionnaire that she believes the death penalty is wrong also was retained after saying she might be able to impose a death sentence.\n\n\u201cI think, in the end, she would follow the law and impose the appropriate sentence,\u201d Samour said of that juror.\n\nAttorneys on both sides still have a chance to remove jurors from the jury pool. At group questioning \u2014 the final stage of the process \u2014 they are each allowed to strike 22 jurors without giving a reason.\n\nAfter that, Recht said, both sides will have to hope that the remaining jurors meant what they said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thing that keeps a defense attorney up at night,\u201d he said.\n\nJohn Ingold: 303-954-1068, jingold@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johningold", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Aurora jury selection highlighted by tussles over possible juror bias", "title": "Aurora jury selection highlighted by tussles over possible juror bias", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/14/aurora-jury-selection-highlighted-by-tussles-over-possible-juror-bias/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150120__theater-shooting-trial1p1-2.jpg", "height": 423}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150120__theater-shooting-trial1p1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-14T18:48:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T20:29:10+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Aurora Theater Shooting trial"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1776\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s why we have to educate them about how to do sentencing.\u201dIn the theater shooting case, rehabilitation of jurors has worked both ways.\nOn her juror questionnaire for the Aurora movie theater shooting case, she had noted that her oldest daughter had planned to go to a movie on the same night as the shooting, then canceled.\nThrough three days of individual questioning of potential jurors, the judge and attorneys in the Aurora theater shooting trial have approved 16 jurors for the final stage of jury selection.\nNow, the judge had come to the crux of the jury selection process, and he looked at No.\n86 looked like a schoolkid, sitting pensively in the jury box and gazing up to where the judge presided above her."}
