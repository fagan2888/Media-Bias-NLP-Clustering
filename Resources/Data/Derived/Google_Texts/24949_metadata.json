On the U-M Medical School Instagram page\n\nThe incoming students have all been paired with another student, and a U-M patient and his or her family, for the Family Centered Experience that will help them understand how illness affects individuals and their loved ones. They will also have many opportunities to care for the underserved, including those without insurance at the Student Run Free Clinic in Pinckney, Mich.\n\nIn addition to the white coats and stethoscopes, funded in part by members of the U-M Medical Center Alumni Society, each student also received a pin provided by the Arnold P. Gold Foundation, a public foundation dedicated to fostering humanism in medicine. The pin symbolizes a shared commitment to providing compassionate and competent patient care.\n\nMore facts about this year\u2019s incoming class:\n\n5,776 people applied for a spot in this year\u2019s class \u2013 a 6.2 percent increase over last year.
