Buzzfeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith said the content had been pulled because of editorial concerns, and had since been reinstated because their deletion went against the company's policy.\n\n\"I blew it,\" he admitted in a memo attached to a tweet. \"Twice in the last couple of months, I've asked editors -- over their better judgment and without any respect to our standards or process -- to delete recently published posts from the site.\"\n\nAppreciate the criticism. We just reinstated two posts and I sent this note to staffers. pic.twitter.com/YodxHiQmt2 Photo: Reuters/Brendan McDermid \u2014 Ben Smith (@BuzzFeedBen) April 10, 2015\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nGawker had reported the article's deletion on Thursday. The article discussed body image issues in a new ad by cosmetics company Dove. \u201cDove is at it again with a viral beauty video meant to have women question the way they see themselves: beautiful or average,\u201d the post read. \u201cBecause life is apparently defined by these two labels and nothing else.\u201d\n\nHowever, on Thursday, the page was taken down before being reuploaded later early Saturday. \u201cThis post was inappropriately deleted amid an ongoing conversation about how and when to publish personal opinion pieces on BuzzFeed. The deletion was in violation of our editorial standards and the post has been reinstated,\u201d the update read. Unilever, Dove\u2019s owner, is a BuzzFeed advertiser, according to Gawker.\n\nThe other story was related to the game of Monopoly, which is owned by Hasbro, another BuzzFeed advertiser. The article, which attacked the game, was reportedly removed \u201cat the request of the author\u201d Tom Chivers. Chivers did not delete a tweet promoting the game and did not comment when asked by the Guardian about its removal.\n\nHowever, Smith stressed that the articles were pulled not because of their content, but their tone. \"When we approach charged topics like body image and feminism, we need to show not tell,\" he wrote. \"Using our own voices to advance a personal opinion often isn't in line with BuzzFeed Life's tone and editorial mission.\"\n\nHe also told the Guardian that all the site\u2019s other articles critical of Unilever were still available.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "buzzfeed, buzzfeed content removal, buzzfeed editorial, buzzfeed story removal, buzzfeed advertiser, buzzfeed editorial policy bviolation, buzzfeed editorial violation, buzzfeed advertiser removal, buzzfeed removes articles, buzzfeed advertising policy, b", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "The site's editor said the articles had been pulled because of their tone, not their content.
