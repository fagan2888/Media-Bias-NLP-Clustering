Trinity Health operates 86 facilities in 21 states.\n\n\u201cNo American should be forced to commit an abortion,\u201d said ADF Senior Counsel Kevin Theriot. \u201cNo law requires faith-based hospitals and medical personnel to commit abortions against their faith and conscience, and, in fact, federal law directly prohibits the government from engaging in any such coercion. In addition, the government can\u2019t tie any funding to a requirement that hospitals and health care workers give up their constitutionally protected freedoms. We look forward to defending those freedoms in this case.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who doubt that anyone would ever try to force someone to commit an abortion need only look at this case,\u201d explained ADF Senior Counsel Matt Bowman. \u201cThis is precisely what the ACLU is seeking to do. But forcing Catholic hospitals to perform abortions is not only against the law, it makes no sense at all. Patients should always have the freedom to choose a health care facility that respects life and to choose doctors who do not commit abortions.\u201d\n\n\u201cForcing health care workers to act contrary to the very faith and ethical convictions that led them into the medical profession\u2014to serve, help, and bring healing to people\u2014is counterproductive, unnecessary, and against the law,\u201d Bowman added.\n\n\u201cHere, the Medical Applicants represent members that are affected by the policy directives of the Defendants\u2019 hospitals on a daily basis,\u201d wrote the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division, in its order in American Civil Liberties Union v. Trinity Health Corporation. \u201cThe outcome of the litigation could have an effect on the day-to-day aspect of their duties as healthcare professionals. Accordingly, finding that the Medical Applicants are regulated by the policy directives at issue, the Medical Applicants are able to intervene as of right.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"url": "http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/court-rules-to-allow-doctors-help-hospitals-sued-forcing-abortions-to-be-performed-80412/", "image": "http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gavel-1017953_640.jpg", "type": "website", "title": "Court rules to allow doctors help hospitals sued, forcing abortions to be performed"}, "google-translate-customization": "7236b401605984b1-3bcbee0db8307092-g6f41da462829b1d2-19", "keywords": "Christian News, Religion News, 2016 Election, Outbreak News, Weird News, Movie News, US News, Breaking News, Internet News, Google News", "msvalidate.01": "F9A11A184D618AB8623122584A1DAB2D", "google-site-verification": "iI9n62s9s0Z-wJUY9p3-wGZp6AQYcH-Z1tDba2QiaT0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But forcing Catholic hospitals to perform abortions is not only against the law, it makes no sense at all.\nTrinity Health operates 86 facilities in 21 states.\nA federal court agreed to allow several pro-life doctor groups to intervene in defense of a Catholic hospital system which the American Civil Liberties Union sued last year.\nIn addition, the government can\u2019t tie any funding to a requirement that hospitals and health care workers give up their constitutionally protected freedoms.\nIn December, Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys representing the Catholic Medical Association, the Christian Medical and Dental Associations, and the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists asked the court to allow the groups to intervene."}
