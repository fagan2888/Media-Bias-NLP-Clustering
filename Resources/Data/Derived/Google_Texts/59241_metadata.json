So far, it has issued only four rulings in the 31 cases that have come up for hearings. Its most noteworthy action in the term so far was its decision on the first day to bypass the same-sex marriage issue in cases from five states. But, with their return this week from a long winter break, the Justices are heading into a potentially momentous period.\n\nThe coming weeks bring a new look by the Justices at the same-sex marriage question, in cases from five more states, and will provide a make-or-break test for President Obama\u2019s most significant domestic program, the nearly five-year-old federal health care law.\n\nBehind both of those issues lurk larger questions about the role of the courts in answering some of America\u2019s most divisive and consequential questions. The marriage cases are this generation\u2019s version of a constitutional dispute over the nature of American culture, and the new health care controversy is a monumental test of government power in the guise of a simple question about how to interpret four words in a federal law.\n\nFor those involved in the cultural conflict over same-sex marriage, a campaign that actually got its start in Hawaii in the early 1990s, the most decisive moment seems to have arrived. The Justices will meet on Friday in a private conference, and they will take a new look at the issue of whether the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of legal equality or its promise of fairness in public policy will extend marriage rights for the first time to gays and lesbians.\n\nIt might be suggested that taking that step has been made easier for the Justices, because more than three dozen decisions have been issued by lower court judges striking down state bans on such marriages, so that gays and lesbians can now get married legally in all but 14 of the 50 states, plus Washington, D.C. Just this week, Florida became the 36th same-sex marriage state. Seven out of every ten Americans live in a state where those marriages are now legal.\n\nBut the Supreme Court is the only tribunal with the authority \u2013 other than those with the power to amend the Constitution itself \u2013 to decide that same-sex marriage is to be a constitutional reality everywhere in the nation, accomplished in one fell swoop by the votes of nine judges. It will give them pause, even if the way seems to have been paved for them.\n\nActually, the Justices have more than one question to answer. There are the basic issues about getting married legally and about gaining official state recognition for same-sex marriage already performed in other states. But beyond that, the new cases will ask the Justices to spell out a formula for judging other kinds of discrimination against sexual orientation, and to decide whether, in fact, the whole issue of gay rights is better handled by state legislatures, Congress and the voters at the nation\u2019s ballot boxes. One federal appeals court has already ruled that the choice should be left to those other government actors, not the courts.\n\nIf the Justices decide to take on the issue (and that now seems more likely than it turned out to be in October because there was then no split among federal appeals court, but now there is), the issue would likely come up for hearing in April, with a final decision before early next summer.\n\nThis time, the gay rights question is considerably more significant than when it came up in the court two years ago, in the case of United States v. Windsor. In that ruling, the court struck down a key part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, and thus guaranteed equal access to federal marital benefits for same-sex couples \u2013 but only if they already were legally married under their own states\u2019 laws. The decision conferred no new marriage rights, as such. But, though that ruling was limited, in its own terms, it set off the wave of lower court rulings that overwhelming have gone in favor of marriage for gays and lesbians. Now, it is the Justices\u2019 turn to have their say.\n\nAnd it shortly will be the Justices\u2019 turn to have something really important to say about the running controversy over how the nation deals with access to health care, especially for Americans with lower incomes. The court already has agreed to rule on the next controversy over the Affordable Care Act, first enacted in March 2010. And the ruling this time may have more to do with the survival of the Act, as a practical economic matter, than was the Justices\u2019 ruling two years ago upholding the requirement that nearly every American must have health insurance or pay a penalty to the federal government.\n\nThis time, the court will have to sort out what Congress meant when it set up a system of federal subsidies to help people with lower incomes afford to buy health insurance on one of the new marketplaces set up under the 2010 law. At issue is whether those subsidies will be available only to consumers who shop for insurance at a marketplace set up by a state government \u2013 the situation in 16 states \u2013 or whether those subsidies will be available at marketplaces across the country, including the 34 states where the federal government set up those exchanges.\n\nAt the core of the dispute before the court is what Congress had in mind when it created the subsidy system, and applied it to exchanges \u201cestablished by the state\u201d \u2013 the four critical words in the Act on this point. Does that mean only state-established exchanges, or all exchanges? If it is the latter, the economic assumptions of the entire Act will be more likely to come true, and the system with survive. If it the former, it is generally agreed that the Act will succumb to what has been called a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d \u2013 not enough people with insurance to make it worthwhile for insurance companies to offer affordable health care coverage.\n\nThe larger constitutional questions looming behind this version of the health care dispute include just how much leeway the Executive Branch has to modify a major federal program as it moves along toward fulfillment, and just when must the Executive return to Congress if such a program seems to run into roadblocks that will stymie it. If the court rules for the challengers to the subsidy system, there is next to no chance that Congress would repair the new health care law, and that just might end the bold experiment in national health insurance policy.\n\nThese daunting prospects begin to face the Supreme Court right now.\n\nRecent Stories on Constitution Daily\n\nFor National Trivia Day: 10 Founding Fathers tidbits\n\nCameras in the Supreme Court?
