Greg Abbott of Texas has refused to expand Medicaid -- and receive a huge influx of federal dollars -- under the Affordable Care Act, just as his predecessor Gov. Rick Perry refused to do.\n\nIn Texas, 85 percent of the people in nursing homes depend on Medicaid or Medicare.\n\n\"What our providers tell us is their inability to pay competitive wages is a major factor [in turnover],\" Kibbe told The Dallas Morning News.\n\n\"It\u2019s important to keep in mind where Texas is heading,\" Kibbe added. \"We are on the verge of significant growth in elderly in this state. Obviously people are living longer and a lot of people are moving to Texas.\"\n\nThere is more than a $300 million shortfall between what nursing homes spend and what they are reimbursed, according to Texas Health Care Association President Kevin Warren.\n\n\"At the end of the day, employees have their own responsibilities to their own families,\" Warren told the newspaper. \"You have some of the most compassionate and caring people that work in long-term care. When you lose a staff member that\u2019s been there for many years \u2026 it is a very difficult decision for them to uproot and move.\"", "article_metadata": {"theme-version": "1.2.4", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0", "description": "Workers, including nurses, are reportedly leaving their jobs in Texas nursing homes because the pay is worse t...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "Workers Quit Texas Nursing Homes For McDonald's (Video)", "modernizr-version": "2.8.3", "foundation-version": "5.4.7", "msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "og": {"url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/health/texas-nursing-homes-employees-earn-less-mcdonalds", "image": "http://images.opposingviews.com:8080/ovi/catalog/downloads/preview/rndr_670x300//2016/04/olderwoman-1460422079.jpg/rndr_670x300.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Workers, including nurses, are reportedly leaving their jobs in Texas nursing homes because the pay is worse t...", "title": "Workers Quit Texas Nursing Homes For McDonald's (Video)"}, "DC.date.issued": "2016-04-12T00:09:21+00:00", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "publish_date": "2016-04-12T00:09:21+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/ov_foundation/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "ov": {"id": 874136}, "theme-color": "#0e0e0e"}, "article_summary": "The annual turnover rate for nurses in Texas nursing homes is 94 percent, according to the 2013 Nursing Facility Cost Report.\nWorkers, including nurses, are reportedly leaving their jobs in Texas nursing homes because the pay is worse than McDonald's and other fast food restaurants (video below).\nIn Texas, 85 percent of the people in nursing homes depend on Medicaid or Medicare.\nThere is more than a $300 million shortfall between what nursing homes spend and what they are reimbursed, according to Texas Health Care Association President Kevin Warren.\nAccording to Sulik, Texas' low Medicaid reimbursement rate is a big reason why the pay is low."}
