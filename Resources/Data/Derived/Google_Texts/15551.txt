Toby Pientok, general manager of Jason’s Deli, said he is honored to have racked up four tops spots — favorite leafy greens, all-you-can-eat, catering and deli fare.

“It’s a gratifying feeling to see that the city appreciates us and loves our restaurant,” he said. “Great service is what our company is all about, and we are glad the community feels that we give that.”

Providing Amarillo with an in-depth look at the community’s favorite spots since 2002, Best of Amarillo Magazine lets you browse through more than 120 categories for dining, local shopping, services and community businesses in this year’s bigger-than-ever publication.

Voted best locally owned store, Raffkind’s Clothiers has been a local favorite since the contest began, winning or being favorites in multiple categories.

Adrea Pearson, the sales manager and buyer for Raffkind’s, said it’s all due to the customers.

“Winning just reinforces the fact that local businesses have a wonderful opportunity to meet the needs of their customers,” she said. “You walk in and we know your name, just like you know ours. To be David going up against Goliath and winning against large department stores feels awesome!”

Best of Amarillo Magazine represents the voice of the Amarillo community, giving people an in-depth look into what is popular around town.

Your new favorite hangout, restaurant or shopping spot is just beyond the cover! The Best of Amarillo party to celebrate the winners is right around the corner. Get your tickets at amarillo.com/boatickets for the party of the year, scheduled for Oct. 23 in Amarillo Civic Center.
