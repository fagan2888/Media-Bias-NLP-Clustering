ANALYSIS/OPINION:

Marching along in a small-town parade on Saturday is the Independence Day activity of choice for 10 presidential hopefuls who are ready for cheerful photo ops and meaningful soundbites. But it’s a crowded field. Some of the rivals are walking in the exact same parades.

In New Hampshire, for example, Jeb Bush, will step to the music in Amherst and Merrimack. Rick Perry is in the same two parades. So is Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic hopeful Lincoln Chafee. Spectators get four-for-the-price of one here.

Sen. Marco Rubio will be in Wolfeboro — the swanky summer home of Mitt Romney — for their big to-do. But Mr. Rubio does not have an exclusive, though. Gov. Chris Christie also will be there. Hillary Rodham Clinton, meanwhile, marches with the locals in the towns of Glen and Gorham.

White House hopefuls will also be in Iowa — but without such close encounters. Gov. Bobby Jindal marches in the Urbandale parade, while Sen. Bernie Sanders strides the streets of both Creston and Waukee. Martin O’Malley will walk the parade route in Independence — then ironically attends a big barbecue in a town called Clinton.
