However, the provision requires insurance issuers and third party administrators to provide contraceptive coverage to employees.\n\nIn response, organizations in Michigan and Tennessee, including the Michigan Catholic Conference and Catholic Charities Diocese of Kalamazoo, filed a lawsuit against the federal government. They claimed the provision violates their rights under the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act.\n\nOn Friday, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion upholding the provision, saying it \"effectively insulates these entities from the contraception-provision process.\"\n\n\"They no longer have to pay for contraceptive coverage, and all individuals under their plans are notified of the entity's religious objections,\" the ruling said.\n\nNeither the Michigan Catholic Conference nor the Catholic Charities Diocese of Kalamazoo could be reached for comment Friday afternoon.\n\nRelated: Michigan Catholic Conference challenges Affordable Care Act contraception mandate in federal court\n\nPrior to Friday's opinion, the sixth circuit also had supported the contraceptive mandate, the opinion said.\n\nA U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a case involving Hobby Lobby in 2014 spurred a review of an earlier decision from the appeals panel, as ordered by the nation's high court.\n\nUnder the Hobby Lobby ruling, the Supreme Court decided family-owned for-profit businesses can't be required to provide contraception coverage under the federal health care law.\n\nIn the opinion issued Friday, the sixth circuit said the Hobby Lobby decision does not change its belief the contraception provision does not violate the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act.\n\nThe issue in the Hobby Lobby case is \"fundamentally different\" from the issue at \"the heart of this case \u2013 whether an entity's decision not to provide such coverage by exercising an accommodation is, by itself, a violation of that entity's religious beliefs,\" the opinion said.\n\n\"We upheld this accommodation against a RFRA challenge in our initial opinion,\" the opinion said. \"Nothing in Hobby Lobby changes this.\"\n\nBrian McVicar covers education for MLive and The Grand Rapids Press.
