So he shifted gears, this time leveraging the healthcare industry\u2019s shift towards preventive care to help both patients and the bottom line.\n\nRobinson and his wife, Kyle, are building a platform called Wellzesta, a program that boosts engagement and overall wellness with seniors in planned living communities and takes advantage of financial opportunities possible with wellness-focused insurance companies created by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cLife plan communities are reinventing themselves into comprehensive wellness providers,\u201d said Robinson, who noted that baby boomers are more demanding in terms of retirement and senior living amenities. \u201cWellness is the new frontier in preventive medicine \u2026 This is the wild West.\u201d\n\nThe platform integrates mental engagement and learning modules, a social media element and electronic medical records into one system, which also helps communities monitor changes in the physical and mental health of residents.\n\n\u201cWe are emphasizing all of the elements of wellness that are typically overlooked,\u201d said Robinson, who plans to release a version in early August. \u201cIf you\u2019re lacking any one of those [elements], your wellness is impaired.\u201d\n\nGreenville Coffee Roasters\n\nIt started as a hobby for Greenville entrepreneur Josh Tucker, an ongoing trial-and-error process that transformed pounds of raw coffee into dark brown beans using an old-school popcorn maker. As he got better, he and Greenville-based Designli.co partner Keith Shields realized it could be more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing if my mom thinks it\u2019s good,\u201d said Tucker. \u201cBut if everyone does, maybe it could work.\u201d\n\nThis month, Tucker and Shields launched Greenville Coffee Roasters, a subscription company that sells locally roasted single-bean coffee starting at $16 per month for 12-ounce packages.\n\nThe pair are banking on the growing \u201cbuy local\u201d movement in Greenville, along with the trend toward handcrafted and semi-artisan items. That, and the fact that people want to try new things and know how much coffee they typically consume, according to Shields. \u201cThat\u2019s another thing that just screams \u2018subscription service,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThe business model provides cash flow for production, which keeps costs down and requires minimal up-front backing that can stymie other startups, said Tucker. The small batches and local focus also ensure the delivery of fresh-roasted coffee, which is best ground and consumed between three days and two weeks after they roast, bag and ship it, he said.\n\n\u201cI used to think that was a lot of BS \u2026 but it really makes a difference,\u201d said Tucker. \u201cMicro-roasting is what craft beer brewing is right now.\u201d\n\nTucker and Shields hope to use the first phase to determine frequency, quantities and what coffee varieties they should offer. Future expansion could include sales to businesses and restaurants.\n\nMore from this week\u2019s cover story\u2026\n\nTech startups face an uphill funding battle in the Upstate >>", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Upstate Business Journal", "description": "An app developer and a coffee roaster set out to make their marks", "title": "A tale of two startups - Upstate Business Journal", "url": "http://upstatebusinessjournal.com/news/a-tale-of-two-startups/", "image": "http://upstatebusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GreenvilleCoffeeRoasters.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 12702529}, "twitter": {"domain": "Upstate Business Journal", "title": "A tale of two startups - Upstate Business Journal", "image": {"src": "http://upstatebusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/GreenvilleCoffeeRoasters.jpg"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "An app developer and a coffee roaster set out to make their marks"}}, "article_summary": "More from this week\u2019s cover story\u2026Tech startups face an uphill funding battle in the Upstate >>\nThe business model provides cash flow for production, which keeps costs down and requires minimal up-front backing that can stymie other startups, said Tucker.\nThat, and the fact that people want to try new things and know how much coffee they typically consume, according to Shields.\nSo he shifted gears, this time leveraging the healthcare industry\u2019s shift towards preventive care to help both patients and the bottom line.\n\u201cWe are emphasizing all of the elements of wellness that are typically overlooked,\u201d said Robinson, who plans to release a version in early August."}
