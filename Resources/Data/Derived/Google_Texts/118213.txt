The 200th anniversary of the British attack on Washington that culminated in the burning of the White House was marked by re-enactments over the weekend. It was also celebrated with an event at the U.K. embassy in Washington — which featured a White House cake and joked “Only sparklers this time!”

When the British attacked in August 1814 (during the War of 1812), President James Madison was forced to flee the capital with a small group of aides, while Dolley Madison saved a painting of George Washington before heading out as well. They quickly returned, after the British troops left.

The War of 1812 is best remembered in America — when it is remembered at all — for the American defense of Baltimore, commemorated in Francis Scott Key’s Star Spangled Banner, which later became the national anthem.

Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, took the embassy’s tweets in stride, responding via her Twitter account: “The difference 200 years can make in foreign relations: 8/24/1814: #ItsComplicated vs 8/24/2014: #SpecialRelationship ”

Still, you can guess what happened next — after some mild chuckles and criticism on Twitter, the embassy backtracked and apologized for the tweet.

Later, lead State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the U.S. didn’t take any offense to the U.K. embassy’s celebrations. She said those that raised concerns probably didn’t “understand British humor.”
