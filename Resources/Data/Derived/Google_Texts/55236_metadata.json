That\u2019s a big commitment, and many in the addiction field are highly encouraged.\n\nBut for the plan to make a dent in a crisis that\u2019s now killing nearly 30,000 Americans a year, it will have to overcome several big hurdles. Here are five of them.\n\nThe stigma against treating drugs with drugs persists\n\nMany in the so-called recovery community are wary of treating an opiate addiction by prescribing another opiate.\n\narticle continues after advertisement\n\nObama\u2019s plan puts most of the funding toward getting opioid abusers on medication, typically methadone and buprenorphine. Those drugs aren\u2019t heroin, but they can be abused. There\u2019s also a risk that the medications will be diverted and sold to other addicts.\n\nFor those skeptics, \u201cabstinence is the treatment of choice,\u201d said Dr. Hilary Connery, clinical director of the alcohol and drug abuse treatment program at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass. \u201cReplacing one drug with another drug, that\u2019s not what they consider the goal of recovery.\u201d\n\nAn endorsement from the White House is one way to reverse this stigma. But there\u2019s no getting around the fact that the administration is putting most of its resources behind a treatment that still hasn\u2019t won over everybody in the field.\n\n\u201cThe knee-jerk response is to not really think about medications because we want to do things as \u2018natural\u2019 as possible,\u201d said Dr. Joseph Lee of the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, which has treatment centers across the country.\n\nHowever, Lee said, \u201cthe evidence is pretty overwhelming that being on a medication can save lives compared to not being on medication.\u201d\n\nThere aren\u2019t enough doctors to prescribe the medications the White House is pushing\n\nJust 30,000 doctors across the United States are certified to prescribe buprenorphine. That\u2019s not a lot, considering that an estimated 2.1 million Americans are addicted to opioid painkillers and another half million are addicted to heroin.\n\n\u201cAre they going to train the workforce? If people aren\u2019t comfortable prescribing, that\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Dr. Alexander Walley, medical director of the Narcotic Addiction Clinic at the Boston Public Health Commission and an attending physician at Boston Medical Center.\n\nIn October, the White House announced a commitment by leading provider groups to double the number of doctors who are certified to prescribe buprenorphine in the next three years. This week\u2019s budget request also included $10 million for a panel to explore allowing nonphysicians to prescribe the treatment.\n\nThe administration is also revisiting regulations that limit the number of patients each doctor can write prescriptions for.\n\nBut updating any policy involving opioids is a delicate proposition. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has stirred a lot of controversy with its efforts to revise opioid painkiller prescription guidelines. The Food and Drug Administration has run into similar trouble. It\u2019s unclear whether the White House will have more luck.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about medication\n\nExperts say medication treatment works best in tandem with therapy. Traditional inpatient treatment is always going to have an important role for acute crises, too.\n\nIn other words, just bumping up the number of methadone prescriptions won\u2019t be enough.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t look at these as separate issues,\u201d Connery said. \u201cThese medications do not work on their own.\u201d\n\nMany doctors don\u2019t feel comfortable prescribing medication treatment unless they know the patient will have adequate social and emotional supports, Connery said.\n\nIt\u2019s vital for patients, too, because \u201csomebody who\u2019s using is not engaging in normal life skills behavior,\u201d said Colleen LaBelle, who helps run the treatment program at Boston Medical Center. \u201cWe want to help them figure out how to put their lives in order. Going to therapy gives them some direction.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s budget included a reference to more spending for \u201crecovery support.\u201d The success of the plan could hinge on what, exactly, that means.\n\nThere are big gaps in insurance coverage\n\nTaxpayer dollars aren\u2019t enough. Experts want to see better coverage for addiction treatment, particularly medications, from private insurance.\n\nAs things now stand, some insurers don\u2019t cover buprenorphine, restrict its use, or require prior approvals that can make it difficult to get patients into quick treatment.\n\nBoth the Mental Health Parity Act of 2008 and the Affordable Care Act were supposed to ensure that health plans would cover mental health treatment, including substance abuse treatment, as thoroughly as other health care.\n\nBut implementation remains a work in progress. Enforcement is spotty at both the state and federal level. And the provider problem rears its head again: Just because substance abuse care is covered doesn\u2019t mean patients can find a doctor in their network who will prescribe medication treatment.\n\nCongress may not approve the spending\n\nMaybe we should have started with this one.\n\nA president\u2019s budget is just a proposal. Congress has to appropriate the money. And this particular Republican-controlled Congress has said \u2014 in an unprecedented move \u2014 that it will not even hold hearings on Obama\u2019s budget. That\u2019s hardly a good omen.\n\nOn the other hand, key members like Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee have signaled a willingness to work with the administration on substance abuse. It is also a big issue for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nAnd last year\u2019s government spending bill included a $100 million funding increase, to $400 million, for efforts to combat the opioid crisis. So there is a precedent for opening the purse strings, at least a little.\n\nThe bottom line on the president\u2019s billion-dollar bet?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things that can go wrong with so many moving pieces,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not to say \u2026 it\u2019s not a step in the right direction.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "For the plan to make a dent in a crisis that\u2019s now killing nearly 30,000 Americans a year, it will have to overcome several major hurdles.", "og": {"site_name": "STAT", "description": "For the plan to make a dent in a crisis that\u2019s now killing nearly 30,000 Americans a year, it will have to overcome several major hurdles.", "title": "A reality check on Obama's billion-dollar opioid addiction plan", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Methadone_GettyImages-103738186-1024x576.jpg", "height": 576}, "updated_time": "2016-03-09T16:25:13-04:00", "url": "https://www.statnews.com/2016/02/12/obama-opioid-treatment-plan/", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "twitter": {"description": "For the plan to make a dent in a crisis that\u2019s now killing nearly 30,000 Americans a year, it will have to overcome several major hurdles.", "creator": "@dylanlscott", "image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Methadone_GettyImages-103738186-1024x576.jpg", "title": "A reality check on Obama's billion-dollar opioid addiction plan", "site": "@statnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 933808010032702, "pages": 1456948254627841}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-stat-logo-teal-270x270.png", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/statnews/", "published_time": "2016-02-12T05:00:25-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dylanlscott13", "section": "Health", "modified_time": "2016-03-09T16:25:13-04:00", "tag": "opioids"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "addiction, barack obama, opioids"}, "article_summary": "article continues after advertisementObama\u2019s plan puts most of the funding toward getting opioid abusers on medication, typically methadone and buprenorphine.\nIt\u2019s not just about medicationExperts say medication treatment works best in tandem with therapy.\nBoth the Mental Health Parity Act of 2008 and the Affordable Care Act were supposed to ensure that health plans would cover mental health treatment, including substance abuse treatment, as thoroughly as other health care.\nAnd last year\u2019s government spending bill included a $100 million funding increase, to $400 million, for efforts to combat the opioid crisis.\nThat\u2019s not a lot, considering that an estimated 2.1 million Americans are addicted to opioid painkillers and another half million are addicted to heroin."}
