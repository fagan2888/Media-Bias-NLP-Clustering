The investment would also lead to thousands of construction jobs, and support up to 40,000 jobs elsewhere in its supply chain over 10 years, Nike said in a release distributed by the White House.\n\nNike has 26,000 U.S. employees and more than 1 million workers in 700 contract factories worldwide that manufacture its shoes. Its top-end soccer and baseball shoes retail for more than $300.\n\nObama is scheduled to speak at Nike's headquarters on Friday.\n\nParker said Nike would give Obama a one-of-a-kind pair of red, white and blue \"Air Force One\" sneakers to commemorate the visit.\n\nAn administration official said Nike approached the White House about the trade deal issues, which led to the trip. White House aides had been coy all week about why they chose Nike, which suffered for years from a tarnished image for using Asian sweatshops to make its products.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Sports shoe maker Nike Inc put its weight behind President Barack Obama's push for a t", "title": "Nike on TPP: Just Do It and We'll Create 10,000 U.S. Jobs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/08/Nike-TPP-Just-Do-It-and-Well-Create-10000-US-Jobs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08082012_nike_olympics_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/08/Nike-TPP-Just-Do-It-and-Well-Create-10000-US-Jobs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/08082012_nike_olympics_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Sports shoe maker Nike Inc put its weight behind President Barack Obama's push for a t", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "If the TPP deal is sealed, Nike said it planned to create as many as 10,000 domestic manufacturing and engineering jobs.\nSports shoe maker Nike Inc put its weight behind President Barack Obama's push for a trade deal with Asian countries on Friday with a promise to create up to 10,000 U.S.-based manufacturing jobs if the pact is approved.\nAn administration official said Nike approached the White House about the trade deal issues, which led to the trip.\nNike has 26,000 U.S. employees and more than 1 million workers in 700 contract factories worldwide that manufacture its shoes.\nThe investment would also lead to thousands of construction jobs, and support up to 40,000 jobs elsewhere in its supply chain over 10 years, Nike said in a release distributed by the White House."}
