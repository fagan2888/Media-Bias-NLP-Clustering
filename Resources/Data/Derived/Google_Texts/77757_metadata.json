In three of them he's tied for second\u2014with three different candidates: Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Jeb Bush. His rise over the past few weeks is palpable and reflected in the RealClearPolitics average of Granite State polls, which confirms his second-place standing there.\n\n\u201cI think Kasich could be the guy,\u201d said John Feehery, a Republican lobbyist and former top spokesman for House Republican leadership. \u201cIf he comes in second in New Hampshire he could be the big comeback story. He might be the establishment guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe might be the establishment guy.\u201d John Feehery\n\nThe other three establishment-friendly Republicans\u2014Rubio, Bush, and Chris Christie\u2014are all competitive for second place in the Granite State but have formed a circular firing squad. Rubio and his super-PAC are simultaneous slinging arrows at Christie (for being too liberal) and Cruz (for being an inconsistent conservative), while fending off a wave of attacks from Bush (for changing his position on \u201camnesty\u201d) and Christie (for being too young and unprepared).\n\n\u201cIf you avoid the circular firing squad, you're the only one left standing,\u201d Feehery said. \u201cI think there's a bunch of different gun battles going on, and right now no one's shooting at Kasich because they thought he was already dead.\u201d\n\nStaying off attack mode has been a conscious decision, Kasich's top strategist said.\n\n\u201cWhen the other candidates are offering criticisms and darkness and gloom\u2014no optimism about the future, no real solutions to the problems that real people care about\u2014he's doing the exact opposite, and he's connecting with voters,\u201d John Weaver, Kasich's chief strategist, told Bloomberg Politics. \u201cIn a multi-field race if you're playing whack-a-mole and if Harry hits Sam, how do we know that Sam's votes are going to go to Harry and not Dick? So, we don't get involved in that.\u201d\n\nWeaver also fired a warning shot at the Republican field.\n\n\u201cNow, if somebody attacks us, we're going to rain hell on their head. But as far as they leave us alone, we're going to move forward,\u201d he said.\n\nThe cantankerous Ohio governor, well-liked by moderate Republicans but detested by the ascendant conservative base, stuck to his positive and pragmatic message at a town hall Wednesday evening in Gilford, New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cYou know, they say everybody's angry. I don't think everybody's angry. We're not angry people,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cWe just want some solutions and we want to believe the people telling us we're gonna get solutions that they're for real.\u201d\n\nThe approach appears to be paying off in New Hampshire. Kasich has recently picked up endorsements from the Nashua Telegraph and Portsmouth Herald as he barnstorms churches, businesses, and community centers this week. His goal is a strong finish in the Granite State that makes him the clear establishment favorite and gives him the resources to compete for the delegate-rich blue and purple states down the road, such as Michigan and his home state of Ohio, where he's popular.\n\n\u201cI think they all should be running against Hillary [Clinton], not each other,\u201d said James B. Cahill of Moultonboro, New Hampshire, who intends to vote for Kasich. \u201cYou don't get anywhere throwing stones at each other, and it's one of the reasons he's rising, I believe.\u201d\n\nDaunting Obstacles\n\nMore troubling for Kasich, however, is what happens after New Hampshire. Even if the governor and former chairman of the U.S. House Budget Committee places comfortably ahead of his establishment rivals and clears the center-right lane, his obstacles are daunting. He's a misfit for the angry, populist mood of the conservative base. He's stuck at 2 or 3 percent in national polls and isn't competitive in other early states. Just 21 percent of Republican voters across the country view Kasich favorably, while 28 percent view him unfavorably, according to a Monmouth survey released Wednesday.\n\nSome conservative commentators bash Kasich as a liberal in a Republican's clothing. He's unapologetic about his decision to expand Medicaid under Obamacare in Ohio, and uses welcoming rhetoric toward gays and lesbians. Weaver, Kasich's chief strategist, is a polarizing figure within the GOP for his sharp criticism of the far right.\n\nIn an interview, Weaver couldn't resist taking some swipes at Kasich's rivals, saying that he's not pandering like they are. \u201cChris Christie has to pander because his record in New Jersey is so abysmal,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Senator Rubio is one of those rare talents that we rarely see in public life, but when the issue gets tough, he runs like a scalded ape. [Kasich has] been through the fire. He's not pandered, he's not wavered, he's not changed one position.\u201d\n\nThe questions asked at Kasich's Wednesday rally would only fuel the right's skepticism of his ideological roots. One man said he fell on hard times and asked Kasich if he'd support raising the minimum wage (the answer was no). A woman asked how he'd ensure equal pay for women. Another man asked Kasich how he'd protect the health care safety net, saying that it saves lives and that simply rescinding Affordable Care Act coverage \u201cbecomes a larger threat to the American public than ISIS is.\u201d (The governor gave nuanced answers to the latter two questions.)\n\nKasich campaigned with a calm, jovial attitude that contrasts with the eagerness that some of his rivals display. One thing that set him apart is that he openly contemplates losing\u2014and he's sounds quite all right with it. \u201cIf you lose an election, so what?\u201d Kasich said. \u201cIf I lose this election, if I don't do well here, life's gonna go on.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sahil Kapur", "description": "As his rivals fight, the Ohio governor is making a strong play to become the Republican Party's establishment favorite.", "parsely-section": "politics", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ibv55zKqKusU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "As his rivals fight, the Ohio governor is making a strong play to become the Republican Party's establishment favorite.", "title": "John Kasich Rises in New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-01-21/the-wild-card-john-kasich-rises-in-new-hampshire", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ibv55zKqKusU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "As his rivals fight, the Ohio governor is making a strong play to become the Republican Party's establishment favorite.", "title": "John Kasich Rises in New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-01-21/the-wild-card-john-kasich-rises-in-new-hampshire", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ibv55zKqKusU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"status": "As his rivals fight, the Ohio governor is making a strong play to become the Republican Party's establishment favorite."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "John Kasich Rises in New Hampshire", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "O1ARSD6KLVR601", "parsely-author": "Sahil Kapur", "date": "2016-01-21T10:00:13.334Z", "keywords": "Conservative,Jeb Bush,Marco Antonio Rubio,Ohio,New Hampshire,John Richard Kasich,Marco Rubio,Jeb Bush,Chris Christie,John Kasich", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Conservative,Jeb Bush,Marco Antonio Rubio,Ohio,New Hampshire,John Richard Kasich,Marco Rubio,Jeb Bush,Chris Christie,John Kasich", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-01-21T10:00:13.334Z", "parsely-tags": "Conservative,Jeb Bush,Marco Antonio Rubio,Ohio,New Hampshire,John Richard Kasich,Marco Rubio,Jeb Bush,Chris Christie,John Kasich,Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-01-21/the-wild-card-john-kasich-rises-in-new-hampshire"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think Kasich could be the guy,\u201d said John Feehery, a Republican lobbyist and former top spokesman for House Republican leadership.\nJohn Kasich places second in New Hampshire in five out of six recent polls, behind longstanding front-runner Donald Trump.\nIn the chaos that is the New Hampshire Republican primary, one candidate is steering clear of the bumper-car madness and quietly creeping ahead of his rivals.\n\u201cI think they all should be running against Hillary [Clinton], not each other,\u201d said James B.
