The company is the same approved by Lexington School District Two last March.\n\nDistrict officials said the primary reason is a financial one.\n\nDistricts are having to track part-time employees\u2019 hours to ensure they remain under the cap of 30 hours to comply with the Affordable Care Act. Those who work more hours are eligible to receive benefits, and the school district could incur financial penalties if they don\u2019t extend required benefits.\n\nChief Finance Officer Len Richardson said the district likely would have to hire someone to track hours if substitutes\u2019 benefits weren\u2019t taken care of by a larger company like Kelly Services.\n\n\u201cThis will help us avoid big costs down the road with health insurance,\u201d he said.\n\nRichardson said the district also would not have to pay workers\u2019 compensation for substitutes.\n\nSuperintendent Stephen Hefner said utilizing Kelly Services will widen the district\u2019s pool of available, certified substitutes.\n\nIrmo High teacher Peter Lauzon came to the meeting representing a contingent of district teachers who requested the board table its vote on the contract until more information was available. He said he and other teachers were concerned their classrooms wouldn\u2019t have consistent substitutes and substitute coordinators wouldn\u2019t have say over where a sub is placed in their school.\n\n\u201cWe are willingly giving up our local control,\u201d he said.\n\nJulie Gerts, regional sales manager with Kelly Services, said principals will able to maintain control over who is sent to their school since Kelly Services will ask for a list of existing, preferred teachers. Principals also can submit a list of substitutes they do not want.\n\nGerts said those who already substitute in the district and are added to the preferred list will be grandfathered into Kelly Services\u2019 system. New hires in the district must go through substitute-teacher training before being sent to a Lexington-Richland Five school.\n\nTeachers will have access to a 401K program through Kelly Services in addition to other benefits, although the company isn\u2019t part of the South Carolina retirement system.\n\nLauzon also asked about the possibility of losing access to the district\u2019s permanent subs. Hefner said those teachers are employees of the district and aren\u2019t affected by the new contract.\n\nRichardson said he would like to see the system in place in late April or early May. Lauzon said he was concerned about making that large of a change during the late, busy time of the school year would be stressful on the teachers.\n\nLexington-Richland Five officials can terminate the contract if administrators aren\u2019t satisfied with the process.\n\nComments", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cola Daily is your source for free local news and information in Columbia and the Midlands.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "ColaDaily.com", "description": "Cola Daily is your source for free local news and information in Columbia and the Midlands.", "title": "Lexington-Richland Five to outsource school substitute hiring with Kelly Educational Staffing - ColaDaily.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://coladaily.com/files/2014/08/school-bus-lex-5.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-01-27T12:29:55+00:00", "url": "http://coladaily.com/2015/01/27/lexington-richland-five-to-outsource-school-substitute-hiring-with-kelly-educational-staffing/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cola Daily is your source for free local news and information in Columbia and the Midlands.", "creator": "@coladaily", "image": "http://coladaily.com/files/2014/08/school-bus-lex-5.jpg", "title": "Lexington-Richland Five to outsource school substitute hiring with Kelly Educational Staffing - ColaDaily.com", "site": "@coladaily", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": "100009199284505,<head>", "app_id": 1620331954920091}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/ColaDaily", "section": "Education", "published_time": "2015-01-27T00:02:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-27T12:29:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda071\"", "article_summary": "Lexington-Richland Five school board members agreed during their Monday board meeting to enter into a contract with Kelly Educational Staffing, a branch of Kelly Services.\nThe company is the same approved by Lexington School District Two last March.\nThose who work more hours are eligible to receive benefits, and the school district could incur financial penalties if they don\u2019t extend required benefits.\nGerts said those who already substitute in the district and are added to the preferred list will be grandfathered into Kelly Services\u2019 system.\nSuperintendent Stephen Hefner said utilizing Kelly Services will widen the district\u2019s pool of available, certified substitutes."}
