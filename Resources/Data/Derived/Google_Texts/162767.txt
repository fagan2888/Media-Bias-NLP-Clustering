EWING — Hundreds of students were safely evacuated when a small fire broke out on the roof of a walkway between two dorms at The College of New Jersey.

School officials say the fire broke out around 1 a.m. today on the roof of the walkway between Travers Hall and Wolfe Hall but was quickly extinguished by firefighters. No injuries were reported, and the roof only had minor damage.

Students were quickly evacuated from the two buildings and were taken to a recreation hall on the school's campus in Ewing Township, where they stayed for about three hours before they were allowed back to their dorms.

The cause of the fire is under investigation.
