It'll all shake out soon enough. But the Wall Street Journal's latest poll asked about raising the minimum wage, and the results were pretty interesting:\n\nSo 63 percent were in favor of raising the minimum wage to $10.10. That's surprisingly high. Hell, 43 percent even favor raising it to $12.50. I don't imagine that this support is especially deep or passionate, but it's still pretty high. As Damon Silvers of the AFL-CIO says, \"If I was a House Republican, I'd be concerned about opposing anything that polled at 63%.\"\n\nOf course, gun registration polls at better than 63 percent, and so do higher taxes on the rich, just to name a couple of examples. That doesn't seem to have caused very many Republicans to start quaking in their boots. Still, it's encouraging news.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "It gets nearly two-thirds support in the latest WSJ poll.", "title": "Support for a $10 minimum wage is surprisingly high", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/12/support-10-minimum-wage-surprisingly-high", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_wsj_poll_minimum_wage_december_2013_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Support for a $10 minimum wage is surprisingly high", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/12/support-10-minimum-wage-surprisingly-high", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_wsj_poll_minimum_wage_december_2013_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_wsj_poll_minimum_wage_december_2013_0.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Congress,Economy", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd10d\"", "article_summary": "But the Wall Street Journal's latest poll asked about raising the minimum wage, and the results were pretty interesting:So 63 percent were in favor of raising the minimum wage to $10.10.\nI don't imagine that this support is especially deep or passionate, but it's still pretty high.\nHell, 43 percent even favor raising it to $12.50.\nI'm not super interested in the latest poll results about whether Obama's approval is up or down a point or two, or whether Obamacare is up or down a point or two.\nThat's surprisingly high."}
