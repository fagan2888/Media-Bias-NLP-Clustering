Residents of the Bessemer Cutoff who need help getting registered for health insurance coverage through the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) can meet with trained counselors at an event in Bessemer next week.

The session will be held at Bessemer City Hall on Thur., Jan. 15, from 4-8 p.m., according to a news release on Monday from Bessemer City Councilman Chester Porter.

Navigators and counselors will be present to answer questions and help attendees fill out enrollment forms.

People are encouraged to attend if they need health insurance, whether or not they have a full- or part-time job. Small business owners, fast-food workers and day-care workers are also encouraged to take part.

Attendees should bring their Social Security cards, other identification and any insurance cards they may have, in addition to any relevant family information, the release states.

Porter, who represents Bessemer's District 2, is hosting the event along with Enroll Alabama, Birmingham Health Care, Humana and The Dannon Project.

Porter hosted a similar ACA in Bessemer in March of last year.

Bessemer City Hall is located at 1800 Third Ave. North.
