Conservative purists place the blame squarely on Barack Obama\u2019s shoulders. The president\u2019s autocratic style at home and his appeasement of dictators abroad triggered a pitchfork revolt. Democrats, in turn, hold Republicans responsible for years of vitriolic attacks designed to delegitimize the president, which only encouraged extremism. But there\u2019s also a deeper reason for the Trumparama. Decades of increasingly hostile media coverage toward the White House and years of rising partisanship, mean that presidents tend to give birth to political alter egos. Trump\u2019s advance is striking because he represents the antithesis of Obama. Sure, on a handful of issues, their views overlap\u2014for example, on the dangers of U.S. intervention in the Middle East. But more often, Trump looks like a photographic negative of the president. Obama was a community organizer and professor; Trump is a businessman and reality-television star. Obama is a cerebral \u201cSpockian\u201d; Trump is a bombastic braggadocio. Obama visited Cairo in 2009 \u201cto seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world\u201d; Trump wants to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. Obama built a potent alliance of minorities and highly educated whites; Trump\u2019s support is based on whites without college educations and almost no minorities. Obama struggled to sell his message in the Appalachian regions of Arkansas, Kentucky, and West Virginia; that is Trump\u2019s heartland. Obama is the first black president; Trump\u2019s supporters tend to view whites significantly more positively than blacks. Latest from Politics The Edge: Trump\u2019s Magic Number What explains Trump\u2019s rise? Many establishment Republicans have cast an accusing eye straight at the White House. According to Jeb Bush, Trump is \u201ca creature of Barack Obama.\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Ross Douthat said the Trump phenomenon is \u201cfirst and foremost a Republican and conservative problem.\u201d Nevertheless, Douthat continued, Obama\u2019s celebrity brand of politics, imperial presidential style, and rejection of white working-class voters all aided Trump\u2019s emergence. There\u2019s a pinch of truth here. Obama created a coalition based on demographic groups that are growing (minorities and the college educated) rather than declining (noncollege-educated whites). And Obama has sometimes displayed a condescending attitude toward those who \u201ccling to guns or religion.\u201d But Obama is hardly the political radical of Republican imagination. After all, his signature issue\u2014Obamacare\u2014looks a lot like Republican health-care proposals from the 1990s, before the GOP made a hard right. And some conservative criticisms of Obama seem wildly misplaced. For example, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal recently wrote: \u201cAfter seven years of the cool, weak and endlessly nuanced \u2018no drama Obama,\u2019 voters are looking for a strong leader who speaks in short, declarative sentences.\u201d When did nuance become a point of contempt?\n\nThere\u2019s more accuracy in the rival theory that Trump is a Republican creation. After 2008, movement conservatives launched a two-pronged offensive against both Obama and the GOP leadership. Virtually from day one, conservatives obstructed every step of Obama\u2019s agenda\u2014fighting a guerrilla war against Obamacare, threatening a debt-ceiling showdown, and even encouraging Iranian hard-liners to oppose the nuclear deal. At the same time, many influential voices on the far right assailed establishment Republicans as milquetoast moderates. With an illegitimate president and an illegitimate party, it\u2019s no surprise that Republican voters were drawn toward a true outsider\u2014even a hectoring harlequin like Trump. But while the parties point fingers at each other, there\u2019s a larger story here that stretches back decades. It\u2019s no coincidence that Trump is Obama\u2019s dark mirror. Two powerful forces\u2014the increasingly negative media coverage of politics and intensified partisanship\u2014mean that presidents spur the rise of opposite alter egos. After World War II, journalists became steadily more critical of the White House. Coverage of the president in The New York Times that was negative in tone, for example, more than doubled from 12 percent in the 1950s to 28 percent in the 1980s. Today, the media is sometimes seen as being in Obama\u2019s camp. But since 2008, Fox News and conservative talk radio has provided an axis of resistance. And in Obama\u2019s second term, mainstream news coverage has often been highly critical. What happened? Debacles like Vietnam and Watergate naturally led reporters to sharpen their knives. At the same time, the news media became increasingly competitive, with the rise of cable television and the Internet, which encouraged a focus on attention-grabbing (and profitable) negative news. The 19th-century English writer Walter Bagehot said the monarchy needed to be viewed at a distance to retain its mystery and reverence: \u201cWe must not let in daylight upon magic.\u201d Today, journalists cover the presidency in minute detail and shine a bright torch on every indiscretion. They let in the daylight, the magic dissipates, and many people yearn for the political antithesis.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The mogul is just the latest in a series of oppositional candidates\u2014negative reliefs of sitting presidents.", "author": "Dominic Tierney", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "The mogul is just the latest in a series of oppositional candidates\u2014negative reliefs of sitting presidents.", "title": "Is Trump Obama's Dark Doppelg\u00e4nger?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/03/GettyImages_510889824/facebook.jpg?1458157659", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/is-trump-obamas-doppelganger/474108/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/dominictierneyauthor"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "As the Donald Trump monster lays waste to Republican political careers, and even the Grand Old Party itself, survivors wonder: Who released the Kraken?\nObama built a potent alliance of minorities and highly educated whites; Trump\u2019s support is based on whites without college educations and almost no minorities.\nObama is the first black president; Trump\u2019s supporters tend to view whites significantly more positively than blacks.\nObama was a community organizer and professor; Trump is a businessman and reality-television star.\nAnd Obama has sometimes displayed a condescending attitude toward those who \u201ccling to guns or religion.\u201d But Obama is hardly the political radical of Republican imagination."}
