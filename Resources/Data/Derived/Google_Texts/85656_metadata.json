But they face an uphill battle in Montpelier, where key legislative leaders have signed on to Gov. Peter Shumlin\u2019s push to cut $10 million from payroll expenses.\n\nThe relationship between the Democratic governor and the state workers union that endorsed him in the last election has grown tense. The alliance has long been an uneasy one. But it deteriorated precipitously last month, when Shumlin unveiled a budget proposal that relies on $10 million in unspecified labor costs.\n\nOn Tuesday, at the union\u2019s invitation, the governor stopped by the Statehouse cafeteria, where workers had gathered to urge lawmakers to block the proposed cuts. There were some awkward greetings. And then Shumlin listened quietly, as employees like Tom Lague, criticized his proposals to consolidate police dispatch centers, shrink staff at a high school for incarcerated teenagers, and cut payroll costs by $10 million.\n\n\u201cWe know there\u2019s a budget and we know we need to trim corners,\u201d said Lague, who works at one of the state police dispatch centers slated for consolidation under Shumlin\u2019s plan. \u201cBut if we want to grow the economy, cutting the service sector doesn\u2019t appear to be the best route to do it.\u201d\n\nShumlin thanked the workers for their input, though he didn\u2019t offer much in the way of a response. A minute or so later, surrounded by press but still in earshot of the jilted workers, the governor forcefully defended the plan.\n\n\u201cSo the fact is you can always make an argument for not making change,\u201d Shumlin said. \u201cBut taxpayers expect me to make the choices that are necessary to responsibly balance this budget, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to the $10 million in payroll savings at least, Shumlin and the Legislature look to be on the same page. House Speaker Shap Smith says he doesn\u2019t want to have to go after employee wages. But he says the state is dealing with a $112 million budget shortfall.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that any way you slice it, we\u2019re probably going to have to have some labor savings in the budget,\u201d Smith said Tuesday. \u201cWe just can\u2019t close it without.\u201d\n\nEmployee salaries for next year have already been negotiated; Shumlin wants the union to reopen that contract, and work with his administration to deliver the $10 million in a way that causes least harm to state services.\n\nBut union officials thus far at least aren\u2019t ready to budge. Later in the day, after their exchange with Shumlin, state employees crowded into the House chamber to rally support for their cause.\n\n\u201cState employees aren\u2019t responsible for fiscal challenges the administration now finds itself in, and that crisis does not constitute an emergency on our part \u2026 or obligate us to open up a contract we already bargained in good faith,\u201d said Leslie Matthews, an environmental scientist at the Agency of Natural Resources.\n\nCritics of the governor\u2019s plan say the proposed cuts would harm dispatch services and delay emergency response times, and erode the integrity and effectiveness of a public high school that serves some of the state\u2019s highest-need students.\n\n\u201cIf the governor and his administration really want to solve the fiscal crisis they find themselves in, they need to raise revenue from the people who can afford it,\u201d Matthews said.\n\nThe Vermont State Employees Association will unveil a slate of revenue proposals next week. Shap Smith says the budget plan already includes the elimination of a tax deduction that will raise $15 million in revenue, most of it from wealthier Vermonters. And Shumlin says his budget plan already strikes the right balance between cuts and tax increases.\n\n\u201cAll we\u2019re saying is, let\u2019s find the areas where government isn\u2019t being efficient, and not always turn to taxpayers and say, \u2018raise taxes, give us more money.' \u201d\n\nAdministration officials say that if the union doesn\u2019t come to bargaining table, it may have to eliminate up to 450 state jobs in order to achieve the targeted savings. Shumlin said that\u2019s likely not the optimal way to make the cuts.\n\nState employees are slated to get a 2.5 percent pay increase next year. Administration officials say foregoing that increase, or a portion of it, could deliver a significant chunk of the needed cuts.\n\n\u201cThe best way to (reduce payroll costs) would be if the union would come to the table and work cooperatively with us to find those savings,\u201d Shumlin said. \u201cWe have to do it; there\u2019s no choice.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "VPR News", "description": "State employees packed the Statehouse Tuesday to fight back against plans to balance the budget by reducing labor costs.
