In a sometimes contentious interview with Bill O'Reilly of Fox News, he said he tries to focus \"not on the fumbles, but on the next plan.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama hit back in a combative Super Bowl Sunday interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, defending his administration's record on everything from health care to Benghazi.\n\nMost pointedly, the president aggressively pushed back at suggestions that he should have fired Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius over the botched rollout of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cMy main priority right now is making sure that it delivers for the American people,\u201d Obama insisted.\n\nPresident Barack Obama talks after he tours General Electric's Waukesha Gas Engines facility in Waukesha, Wisc., Jan. 30, 2014.\n\nObama said the initial problems with the government\u2019s Healthcare.gov web site have been fixed \u201cand now it\u2019s working the way it\u2019s supposed to and we\u2019ve signed up 3 million people ... . We\u2019re about a month behind of where we anticipated we wanted to be.\u201d\n\nHe brushed off questions from O\u2019Reilly on why he hadn\u2019t fired Sebelius for the fiasco of the web site\u2019s debut.\n\nWhen O\u2019Reilly complained that \u201cI\u2019m paying Kathleen Sebelius\u2019s salary and she screwed up and you\u2019re not holding her (Sebelius) accountable,\u201d Obama replied, \u201cWe hold everybody up and down the line accountable\u201d and added later in a Super Bowl allusion, \u201cI try to focus not on the fumbles, but on the next play.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly also grilled the president on how he and his aides handled the Sept. 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic facility in Libya that resulted in the killing of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.\n\nO\u2019Reilly pressed Obama on whether Defense Secretary Leon Panetta had told him that the attack was carried out by terrorists, as Gen. Carter Ham of the U.S. Africa Command had informed Panetta.\n\n\u201cWhat he (Panetta) told was there was an attack on our compound ... . In the heat of the moment, Bill, what folks are focused on is what\u2019s happening on the ground, do we have eyes on it, how can we make sure our folks are secure.\u201d\n\nThis led to several minutes of interruption and crosstalk as Obama and O\u2019Reilly debated whether the administration had misled the American people about the nature of the attack because Obama and his aides didn\u2019t want Benghazi to affect the 2012 re-election campaign.\n\nObama said he had characterized the attack as an act of terror the day after it took place.\n\nLarry Downing / Reuters President Barack Obama pauses as he discusses unemployment, in the East Room of the White House in Washington, January 31, 2014.\n\nObama told O\u2019Reilly that \u201cwhen you look at the videotape of this whole thing unfolding, this is not some systematic, well-organized process ... . You have a mix of folks who are just troublemakers, you have folks who have an ideological agenda, you have some who are affiliated with terrorist organizations, you have some that are not\u201d but the main lesson of the episode is that \u201cour diplomats are serving in some very dangerous places\u201d and need better protection.\n\nObama also tangled with O\u2019Reilly over the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s investigation of conservative political groups that sought non-profit status.\n\nHe said the reason that former IRS commissioner Douglas Shulman had visited the White House 157 times was that he was discussing with Obama aides the IRS\u2019s role in implementing the Affordable Care Act. The agency is responsible for administering tax credits which will go to those who qualify for subsidies to buy insurance.\n\nObama said Shulman had also been working with White House aides on ways to implement financial reforms to avoid taxpayer bailouts of corporations.\n\nHe added that while \u201cbone-headed decisions\u201d were made in the IRS probes of non-profit groups, there was \u201cnot even a smidgen of corruption.\u201d\n\nOf the controversy, Obama said, \" ... These kinds of things keep on surfacing, in part because you and your TV station will promote them.\"\n\nAs for Super Bowl, Obama deftly sidestepped giving a prediction about the winner. The two opposing teams are \u201ctoo evenly matched,\u201d he said.\n\nHe predicted a final score of 24 to 21, but said \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to be 24 and I don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to be 21.\u201d\n\nThis story was originally published on", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama hit back in a combative Super Bowl Sunday interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, defending his administration's record on everything from health care to Benghazi.\nMost pointedly, the president  aggressively  pushed  back at sugges", "author": "NBC Politics", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "President Barack Obama hit back in a combative Super Bowl Sunday interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, defending his administration's record on everything from health care to Benghazi.\nMost pointedly, the president  aggressively  pushed  back at sugges", "title": "Obama clashes with Fox News's O'Reilly over record", "url": "http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/02/02/22548073-obama-clashes-with-fox-newss-oreilly-over-record", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/reuters/2014-02-02t181853z_1_cbrea111evl00_rtroptp_3_usa-obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "contentId": 22548073, "section": "{\"domainName\":\"nbcpolitics\",\"displayName\":\"NBC Politics\",\"avatar\":\"http:\\/\\/nvcdn.nbcnews.com\\/_vine\\/images\\/av\\/30x30\\/group.gif\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com\\/\",\"type\":\"group\",\"ass\":\"\",\"groupId\":\"7244\",\"articleCount\":\"4978\",\"seedCount\":\"3166\",\"memberCount\":\"33\",\"description\":\"\",\"createDate\":1321036920,\"groupType\":null,\"groupTypeId\":\"5\",\"blessed\":0,\"lastPub\":1464298734,\"isEnabled\":1}", "title": "Obama clashes with Fox News's O'Reilly over record - NBC Politics", "trackData": "{\"section\":\"politics\",\"subSection\":\"nbcpolitics\",\"sitePageId\":\"a22548073\",\"headline\":\"Obama clashes with Fox News's O'Reilly over record\",\"pageSource\":\"NBC Politics\",\"typeName\":\"Story\",\"byline\":\"NBC Politics\",\"tags\":[\"white-house\",\"barack-obama\",\"featured\",\"updated\",\"appfeatured\"],\"seedSource\":\"\"}", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"asap\", \"load_pers\":\"1\"}", "cip": "209.133.57.21", "nv": {"contentId": 22548073, "contentType": "n"}, "date": "May 26, 2016, 5:24 pm", "server": "web09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "canonical": "http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2014/02/02/22548073-obama-clashes-with-fox-newss-oreilly-over-record"}, "article_summary": "Obama told O\u2019Reilly that \u201cwhen you look at the videotape of this whole thing unfolding, this is not some systematic, well-organized process ... .\nPresident Barack Obama hit back in a combative Super Bowl Sunday interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, defending his administration's record on everything from health care to Benghazi.\nObama also tangled with O\u2019Reilly over the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s investigation of conservative political groups that sought non-profit status.\nPresident Barack Obama talks after he tours General Electric's Waukesha Gas Engines facility in Waukesha, Wisc., Jan. 30, 2014.\nAs for Super Bowl, Obama deftly sidestepped giving a prediction about the winner."}
