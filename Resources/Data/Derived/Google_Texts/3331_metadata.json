The next policy meeting is set for April 26-27, followed by one June 14-15.\n\nMester said that, since December, she had slightly downgraded her expectations for rate hikes this year though she did not give a number. In a January interview with Reuters, she said she backed four hikes in 2016. [nL1N14O03O]\n\nRecent signs of inflation and robustness in the labor market, including strong job gains in March [nLNN1FEC58], have encouraged Mester and a handful of her colleagues to predict more tightening is around the corner. Yet earlier this week, Fed Chair Janet Yellen pushed back with cautious comments on looming risks to the U.S. economy. [nL3N1712PK]\n\nPublished forecasts by Fed officials last month suggested two more rate rises were on the way this year.\n\nMester, one of 10 voters on policy, said she marked down her long-run expectations for economic growth and for unemployment. This year she expects between 2.25 and 2.5 percent growth in the world's largest economy.\n\n\"Despite financial market volatility, despite the pain inflicted on the energy sector from falling oil prices, and despite the relatively weak growth abroad, the U.S. economy has proven to be remarkably resilient,\" she said.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Spicer; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve should still raise interest rates gradually t", "title": "Fed's Mester doesn't want to wait too long on rate hike", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/01/Feds-Mester-doesnt-want-wait-too-long-rate-hike", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-fed_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/01/Feds-Mester-doesnt-want-wait-too-long-rate-hike", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-fed_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve should still raise interest rates gradually t", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "And while the Fed is not yet \"behind the curve,\" she said, there is a risk in waiting too long to follow up on December's 0.25-percent rate hike.\nMester, one of 10 voters on policy, said she marked down her long-run expectations for economic growth and for unemployment.\nMester said that, since December, she had slightly downgraded her expectations for rate hikes this year though she did not give a number.\n[nL3N1712PK]Published forecasts by Fed officials last month suggested two more rate rises were on the way this year.\nYet earlier this week, Fed Chair Janet Yellen pushed back with cautious comments on looming risks to the U.S. economy."}
