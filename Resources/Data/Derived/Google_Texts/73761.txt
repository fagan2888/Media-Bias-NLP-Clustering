Power companies were struggling to restore electricity to thousands of people in Mississippi, a day after a powerful storm swept through the southern U.S. and killed at least four people.

Police in Columbia, Miss., were stationed at all major intersections because traffic lights were swept away or destroyed amid Tuesday's powerful storms. Columbia is about 80 miles southeast of the capital of Jackson.

Severe weather also injured 50 people and damaged or destroyed an unknown number of homes and businesses.
