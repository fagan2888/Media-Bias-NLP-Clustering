That's 3.6x greater than the unlisted percentage of other businesses (8.68%).\n\nOf the listed healthcare facilities, 48% contained basic address errors that could result in misdirected patients.\n\n29% of healthcare facilities were also missing accurate phone numbers.\n\nIn other industries, bad online information may result in a lost sale or frustrated customer. However, when one's health is at stake, bad location data can put patients at risk. Indeed, recent research from the Pew Research Center found that 62% of smartphone owners have used their phone in the past year to look up information about a health condition while 67% use their smartphone for turn-by-turn directions.\n\nBAYADA Home Health Care is experiencing first-hand how mobile search is transforming the way they do business, \"When I started, mobile users were 40% of our site traffic. A year and a half later they're 50% and still growing,\" said Richard Ortiz, BAYADA Senior Associate, Business Analytics. \"It's a huge priority for us to ensure all our digital marketing strategies revolve around mobile optimization.\"\n\n\"The reality is that our business is constantly changing \u2014 office addresses, phone numbers, and types of services being updated,\" Ortiz continued. \"Before we engaged Yext, there was a ton of outdated information out there, and we just couldn't keep up. Now, with Yext for Healthcare, we've seen a 600% increase in our local office page views. We chalk this up to finally having a single source of truth for all of our office location data that helps us serve existing clients better while increasing brand awareness from local search.\"\n\nWith Yext For Healthcare as the source of truth for office, facility, and physician location data, healthcare providers of all sizes can:\n\nImprove the patient experience with accurate location data online, all the time, across desktop and mobile devices.\n\nAttract and retain more patients with a seamless journey from local search to in-person appointment.\n\nSave time and money by eliminating the internal inefficiencies caused by location data conflicts.\n\nEnsure physician specialties, contact information, and facility affiliations are up-to-date.\n\nEliminate duplicative location data that hinders local search performance.\n\n\"Healthcare is an inherently local service, and smartphones have fundamentally changed how patients find and engage with local healthcare providers,\" said Howard Lerman, Yext Co-Founder & CEO. \"We're proud that Yext For Healthcare not only helps healthcare providers navigate the changing informational landscape but also allows them to focus on what they do best: serving patients in times of need.\"\n\nVisit www.yext.com/healthcare to learn more about Yext For Healthcare and to set up a demo.\n\nAbout Yext\n\nYext is the global location data management leader, and our mission is to help people go places.
