(Photo: Photo courtesy of John Rae, state Department of Environmental Protection) Story Highlights 293-acre Cedar Branch purchase ends 15-year controversy.\n\nHome to Cooper\u2019s hawk, red-shouldered hawk, barred owl, Pine Barrens tree frog, and the northern pine snake.\n\nA $4.5 million deal has saved 293 acres in Jackson to become a township park and wildlife area, plus it benefits water quality in Ocean County \u2014 and many miles downstream in Barnegat Bay, state environmental officials said Thursday.\n\nBut while applauding the purchase, members of the Sierra Club said it also underscores New Jersey\u2019s faltered open-space funding.\n\n\u201cNew Jersey used to purchase up to 20,000 acres a year of open space and we averaged, between 1998 and 2010, $235 million a year in funding. We are now spending less than half of that and we will be out of funding by the end of this year,\u201d said Jeff Tittel of the Sierra Club, an environmental group. \u201cEvery year, New Jersey loses somewhere between 12,000 and 18,000 acres of open space to development.\u201d\n\nThe Cedar Branch tract along the upper reaches of the Toms River has forest, swamp and old cranberry bogs now reverting to natural wetlands. It had been owned by Hovbilt, one of the Hovnanian group of building companies. While tract lies in the Pine\u00adlands National Reserve, the property is outside the state\u2019s Pinelands zoning master plan that limits development.\n\nFor years, neighbors and conservation groups sought to stave off development of the property, which is largely forested and adjacent to the Colliers Mills Wildlife Management Area. Hovbilt had proposed a large-scale mixed development of homes, town houses and commercial space.\n\nPermanent protection now will ensure clean water in the Toms River headwaters of Cedar Branch and Pole Brook, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. The Toms River carries some 25 percent of the fresh water flowing into Barnegat Bay, but the nutrient pollution picked up from air pollution, lawn fertilizer and other suburban sources is a big part of the bay\u2019s ecological problems, scientists say.\n\nThe property will be split into three management areas: 57 acres to be managed as part of Colliers Mills, 203 acres to become a county natural lands area and 32 acres to be owned by Jackson as a public park.\n\nThe purchase was a joint project with Jackson\u2019s municipal government providing $2 million; $1.75 million from the Ocean County Natural Lands Trust; $500,000 from the state Green Acres program, and $250,000 in Green Acres grant money used by the nonprofit Trust for Public Land, for many years a partner with the county and DEP for preserving land in the bay\u2019s 660-square-mile watershed.\n\nDEP Commissioner Bob Martin touted the purchase as another step toward protecting Barnegat Bay.\n\n\u201cLand preservation is a critical component of the governor\u2019s comprehensive restoration plan for the bay because it improves water quality by reducing the impacts of stormwater pollution on the bay,\u201d and brings recent preservation efforts to 3,635 acres since Gov. Chris Christie announced his plan in December 2010, Martin said.\n\nBut the rather modest Green Acres contribution shows how open-space funding has dried up, according to Tittel.\n\n\u201cThis is the kind of project that in the past the state might have bought itself. Now we don\u2019t have money for it,\u201d he said.\n\nKirk Moore: 609-709-5036; kmoore@app.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.app.com/story/news/local/ocean-county/our-land/2014/05/15/barnegat-bay-ocean-county-environment-jackson/9146983/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Jackson, Ocean County and state put up $4.5 million to buy Cedar Branch tract from developer", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Jackson, Ocean County and state put up $4.5 million to buy Cedar Branch tract from developer", "title": "Jackson land deal will create park, help Barnegat Bay", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/ocean-county/our-land/2014/05/15/barnegat-bay-ocean-county-environment-jackson/9146983/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jackson, Ocean County and state put up $4.5 million to buy Cedar Branch tract from developer", "title": "Jackson land deal will create park, help Barnegat Bay", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8897fdae5c71bdca4a67ab1243cfb87e27937606/c=936-0-4680-3744&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/05/15/cedarbranch2--creditjohnrae.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Barnegat Bay, Jackson, Ocean County, Environment"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0893\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Photo courtesy of John Rae, state Department of Environmental Protection) Story Highlights 293-acre Cedar Branch purchase ends 15-year controversy.\nThe Cedar Branch tract in Jackson includes old cranberry bogs that are reverting to natural wetlands.\nA $4.5 million deal has saved 293 acres in Jackson to become a township park and wildlife area, plus it benefits water quality in Ocean County \u2014 and many miles downstream in Barnegat Bay, state environmental officials said Thursday.\nPermanent protection now will ensure clean water in the Toms River headwaters of Cedar Branch and Pole Brook, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection.\nDEP Commissioner Bob Martin touted the purchase as another step toward protecting Barnegat Bay."}
