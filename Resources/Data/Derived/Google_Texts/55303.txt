Constant changes to Obamacare are muddying the waters for health insurers, so Moody’s Investors Service issued a note Thursday changing its outlook on the sector to negative from stable.

The ratings agency said potentially adverse effects of individual health policies sold on exchanges through the Affordable Care Act, delayed marketing of commercial group plans by a year, and rate pressure on products such as Medicare Advantage, are all working to create an uncertain environment for carriers.

It’s not as if these factors were unknown prior to this year, however, Moody’s analyst Stephen Zaharuk said in a note to clients.

“While all of these issues had been on our radar screen as we approached 2014, a new development and a key factor for the change in outlook is the unstable and evolving regulatory environment under which the sector is operating. Notably, new regulations and presidential announcements over the last several months with respect to the ACA have imposed operational changes well after product and pricing decisions had been finalized,” Zaharuk’s note said.

He adds net margins could be reduced to 2% from an average of roughly 3% and smaller membership growth for insurers.

Further, uncertainty created by private exchanges could disrupt the employer group market, and stagnant employment could limit growth, the note said.

“We continue to expect that these dynamics will have an uneven effect on insurers, as the impact of these factors will vary by market segment and geography. Our view continues to be that the larger and more diversified insurers will be better positioned, both financially and strategically, to meet the challenges facing the sector,” Zaharuk said.

Major insurers were mixed in early trading, with UnitedHealth Group Inc. /quotes/zigman/258846/delayed /quotes/nls/unh UNH and WellPoint Inc. /quotes/zigman/362231/delayed /quotes/nls/wlp WLP up marginally. Humana Inc. /quotes/zigman/229688/delayed /quotes/nls/hum HUM climbed nearly 2%.

Meanwhile, Aetna Inc. /quotes/zigman/272706/delayed /quotes/nls/aet AET and Cigna Corp. /quotes/zigman/222255/delayed /quotes/nls/ci CI were down marginally.
