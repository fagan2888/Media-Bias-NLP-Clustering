The more frequently \u201cthe bear gets loose,\u201d as Obama and top staffers jokingly refer to impromptu walks and trips to restaurants, the more stressful it is for his security detail. Obama himself acknowledges this: He told a crowd in New York earlier this year that \u201cSecret Service gets a little stressed\u201d when he takes walks. Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan tells the Hill: \u201cAny time the president leaves the White House complex, there are risks involved.\u201d\n\nKeep your distance: Senate Republican contenders in battleground states aren\u2019t racing to Sarah Palin\u2019s side to impeach President Obama. The Washington Post reached out to the campaigns of leading GOP candidates in a dozen races this fall that are likely to decide which party will control the chamber. Some were silent, while others said they disagree with former vice-presidential candidate Palin. None endorsed her position.\n\nGM back on the hot seat: General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra returns to Capitol Hill this week for what may be her last and toughest hearing with lawmakers over the auto maker\u2019s botched response to a faulty ignition switch, The Wall Street Journal writes. Barra will face Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, who is one of her harshest critics, and Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, who remains skeptical of GM\u2019s response to the issue. The hearing is scheduled for 10 a.m. on Thursday in a Senate Commerce subcommittee.\n\nDead wrong: Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, has those choice words to describe Texas Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s characterization of the Paul foreign policy. Writing in Politico, Paul says Perry has written a \u201cfictionalized account\u201d of Paul\u2019s foreign policy that\u2019s so mischaracterizing he wonders if Perry even read any of his policy papers. \u201cIn fact,\u201d Paul writes, \u201csome of Perry\u2019s solutions for the current chaos in Iraq aren\u2019t much different from what I\u2019ve proposed, something he fails to mention.\u201d\n\nObamacare ruling looms: An Obamacare court ruling this week could dominate the news if plaintiffs succeed in convincing a judge that the Affordable Care Act doesn\u2019t allow federally run insurance exchanges to distribute premium subsidies. The Hill writes the case has the potential to blow hole in the health-care law\u2019s coverage scheme and deal a serious loss to the administration. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals could issue its ruling as early as Tuesday.\n\nWant to read the latest and most interesting stories and analysis to come out of D.C.?
