It looks to me like that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nClinton recently handed her email server over to the FBI for a potential criminal investigation, so Democrats have been worried about the status of their frontrunner candidate. Meanwhile, support for Sen. Bernie Sanders is spreading throughout the country. There are even unconfirmed reports that former Vice President Al Gore might join the race.\n\nClinton still has a comfortable lead in the polls \u2014 with 55 percent of the vote compared to Sanders\u2019 19.4 percent and Biden\u2019s 12.3 percent, according to Real Clear politics \u2014 but the threat of slipping by next November is real.\n\nAnother Biden candidacy would give Democratic voters an establishment alternative to Clinton.\n\nWhile Sanders supporters might expect their candidate to push for a single-payer health care system, voters could expect Biden to continue policies of the Obama administration like the Affordable Care Act. A vote for Biden would essentially be a vote for a third Obama term. There wouldn't be any radically new ideas on his platform, but he'd offer a more comfortable option.\n\nBiden\u2019s entrance to the race will alter not just the Democratic primary, but the GOP debates as well. Clinton was the focus of conversation in Fox News\u2019 first televised debate, with many questions asked regarding how the Republicans would handle certain issues during debate with Hillary on the national stage.\n\nIf Biden is the frontrunner, the question becomes not who can defeat Clinton, but who can defeat the ongoing legacy of the Obama administration. The last two elections have shown how Republicans struggle with that issue.\n\nBiden previously declared that he\u2019d announce his decision by the end of the summer, and that deadline is rapidly approaching. If he doesn\u2019t enter, he\u2019ll wrap up a successful political career. If he does enter, he\u2019ll be an interesting candidate that could shake things up on both ends of the political spectrum.\n\nBiden, like increasingly popular candidates Sanders and Trump, is a straight-shooter. He says what\u2019s on his mind \u2014 like the time he advocated for LGBT rights when Obama still claimed to be against gay marriage.\n\nIf Trump is correct in his prediction, a national presidential debate between those two could be one of the most honest and entertaining the country has seen in a while.\n\nSources: The Hill , RealClearPolitics / Photo credit: CrowdPac", "article_metadata": {"theme-version": "1.2.4", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0", "description": "Donald Trump treats the 2016 presidential race like a reality show, and his latest theory is that Vice Preside...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "Donald Trump Thinks He'll Face Joe Biden In National Election", "modernizr-version": "2.8.3", "foundation-version": "5.4.7", "msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "og": {"url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/politics/trump-thinks-hell-face-biden-national-election", "image": "http://www.opposingviews.com/", "type": "article", "description": "Donald Trump treats the 2016 presidential race like a reality show, and his latest theory is that Vice Preside...", "title": "Donald Trump Thinks He'll Face Joe Biden In National Election"}, "DC.date.issued": "2015-08-17T01:48:22+00:00", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "publish_date": "2015-08-17T01:48:22+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/ov_foundation/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "ov": {"id": 861085}, "theme-color": "#0e0e0e"}, "article_summary": "Donald Trump treats the 2016 presidential race like a reality show, and his latest theory is that Vice President Joe Biden will stage a come-from-behind victory on the Democratic side.\nThere are even unconfirmed reports that former Vice President Al Gore might join the race.\n\u201cI think so,\u201d Trump answered the question as to whether he could imagine a campaign against Biden at the national level, according to the Hill.\nA vote for Biden would essentially be a vote for a third Obama term.\nThere have been rumors that Biden will run amid mounting skepticism regarding Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal, but the vice president himself has yet to declare his decision either way."}
