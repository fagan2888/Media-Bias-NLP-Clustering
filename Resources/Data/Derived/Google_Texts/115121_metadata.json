Here\u2019s a look at where Clinton stands on the key issues and how those positions could affect the U.S. economy and your wallet if she is elected president.\n\n1. Tax Cuts for the Middle Class\n\nWhile she hasn\u2019t released too many details on how she\u2019ll do it, Clinton has promised to cut taxes for the middle class so people can increase their take-home pay. She also advocates closing tax loopholes and enacting the \u201cBuffett Rule,\u201d which would require millionaires and billionaires to pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes. Additionally, she wants to incentivize businesses to share their profits with workers by providing a 15 percent tax credit to companies that do so.\n\nRelated: How Much Hillary Clinton\u2019s Plan to Tax Texting Will Cost You\n\nWhere she has gotten more specific is her plan to raise the capital gains tax, which is paid on the profits made by individuals when they sell property, stocks, businesses or other assets after holding them for a short period of time. Under Clinton\u2019s plan, investors would be taxed 39.6 percent on their gain on assets held for less than two years, with that rate phasing out to the current 20 percent after the six-year mark, according to CNBC. This change, which is meant to encourage longer-term investing and economic growth, would apply to those in the highest tax bracket, which is nearly $465,000 for married joint filers and $411,500 for single filers.\n\n\u201cFor most Americans, an increase in the capital gains tax won\u2019t affect them at all,\u201d said Tom Wheelwright, certified public accountant and author of \u201cTax-Free Wealth.\u201d \u201cFor the average investor who has their money in an IRA or a 401k, there is no impact by all of this.\u201d\n\n2. Protection for the CFPB\n\nClinton has publicly urged Democrats in Congress to fight a Republican proposal that would limit the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal agency created in the wake of the financial crisis to supervise financial institutions\u2019 dealings with the public. The agency is responsible for supervising and enforcing the laws that cover consumer financial products and services, and it aims to provide better transparency for the consumers who use them.\n\n\u201cThe [CFPB] has only one mission: protecting Americans from unfair and deceptive financial practices \u2014 and it\u2019s succeeding,\u201d she wrote in an open letter to Congress.\n\n3. Increased Wages for the 99 Percent\n\nReducing income inequality is one of the central tenets of Clinton\u2019s campaign. The gap between the richest and poorest Americans is wider than the gap in any other democracy in the developed world, according to U.S. News & World Report.\n\n\u201cCorporate profits are at near record highs, and Americans are working as hard as ever, but paychecks have barely budged in real terms,\u201d Clinton said in a July 2015 speech. \u201cFamilies today are stretched in so many directions, and so are their budgets.\u201d\n\nClinton supports raising the federal minimum wage to $12 per hour. Despite minimum wage hikes by many state and local governments, and by high-profile employers like Walmart and Target, the federal minimum wage remains stuck at $7.25 per hour, the same rate it has been at since 2009. Many advocates of a higher minimum wage, including Clinton competitor Bernie Sanders, want a federal minimum wage of $15 per hour nationwide.\n\nRead: 2016 Presidential Candidates\u2019 Net Worths: Donald Trump vs. Bernie Sanders and More\n\nEven moving the minimum wage to $12 would raise wages for one in four U.S. workers, according to Amy Traub, a senior policy analyst with public policy organization Demos. \u201cThat\u2019s a big segment of the workforce, and it would make a big difference for a lot of people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be really good for consumers\u2019 wallets.\u201d\n\nClinton has also backed President Obama\u2019s expansion of overtime rules to more workers. Starting in 2016, that plan extends overtime protection to nearly 5 million workers, covering salaried workers who make up to $50,400.\n\n4. Options to Avoid or Refinance Student Debt\n\nStudent loan borrowers carry a mean balance of $26,700, and nearly 17 percent of all borrowers are late or in default on their loans, according to a 2015 report published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Furthermore, a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston shows that student loan borrowers appear to be less likely to own a home and have more difficulty accumulating wealth. Clinton addresses the student debt crisis with her \u201cNew College Compact.\u201d\n\nAdvocating for \u201cdebt-free\u201d college, her proposal would allow students to go to in-state public colleges without borrowing any money for education. She also supports a plan to allow Americans with existing student loans to refinance at more favorable rates, which her campaign claims would save the typical borrower about $2,000 over the life of the loan.\n\n5. No Cuts to Social Security\n\nThe 2015 annual report on Social Security projected that retirement and disability trust funds would be depleted in 2034 and then would \u201cpay about three-fourths of scheduled benefits for 50 years,\u201d according to The New York Times. The future of Social Security, however, has long been a big point of contention between the parties. Republicans, in particular, have been calling for cuts and privatization to address the situation.\n\nIn April 2015, Clinton called Republicans who want to cut back Social Security \u201cjust wrong\u201d and said she\u2019d preserve the retirement benefit. \u201cWe do not mess with it, and we do not pretend that it is a luxury \u2014 because it is not a luxury,\u201d she said at a New Hampshire campaign event. \u201cIt is a necessity for the majority of people who draw from Social Security.\u201d\n\nClinton also has stated that she believes women especially need better access to Social Security and has promised to work to \u201cenhance\u201d the program.\n\n6. Paid Family Leave and Affordable Child Care Policies\n\nIt\u2019s been more than 20 years since Bill Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows families to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a new child and deal with their own or a family member\u2019s health needs. That provision puts America behind most other developed countries which offer paid leave for women \u2014 and often men.\n\nAs part of her goal of getting more women in the workforce at higher wages, Hillary Clinton supports family-friendly policies such as paid family leave and affordable child-care policies.\n\n\u201cI believe that what\u2019s good for women is good for America,\u201d she wrote in a 2015 op-ed for women\u2019s lifestyle media platform SheKnows. \u201cTake child care. It\u2019s a women\u2019s issue. It\u2019s also an economic issue. You can\u2019t go to work every day if you can\u2019t afford a safe place to leave your kids.\u201d\n\nThis issue has gained more visibility in recent months as several Silicon Valley companies have announced changes to their parental leave policies that extend more generous benefits to both men and women, according to Wired. Currently, California, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Washington and the District of Columbia offer paid family leave.\n\n7. Pursuit of a New Foreign Trade Agreement\n\nClinton broke with President Obama and with previous statements recently in opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, which would put in place one of the largest free trade areas in the world.\n\n\u201cI still believe in the goal of a strong and fair trade agreement in the Pacific as part of a broader strategy both at home and abroad, just as I did when I was secretary of state,\u201d Clinton said in a statement in October. \u201cI appreciate the hard work that President Obama and his team put into this process and recognize the strides they have made. But the bar here is very high and, based on what I have seen, I don\u2019t believe this agreement has met it.\u201d\n\n\n\n8. Help for Small Businesses\n\nClinton wants to \u201cjump-start small businesses\u201d by reducing the time it takes to start a business, expanding access to capital, simplifying and cutting the taxes paid by small businesses, and using technology to allow small businesses to access new markets both domestically and globally.\n\n\u201cDespite generations of progress on so many other fronts, it\u2019s still too hard to get a business started today,\u201d Clinton wrote on LinkedIn in May. \u201cCredit is too tough to come by. Too many regulatory and licensing requirements are uneven and uncertain.\u201d\n\nKeep Reading: 10 Setbacks All Small Businesses Must Overcome\n\n9. Repeal of the Obamacare \u2018Cadillac Tax\u2019\n\nWhile she has supported the Affordable Care Act and its goal of reducing the number of uninsured Americans, Clinton announced in September that she is opposed to the so-called \u201cCadillac tax,\u201d which imposes a tax on employers with the most expensive health plans. The goal of the tax is to reduce overall health care costs, but critics say it\u2019s encouraging employers to simply reduce the quality of their insurance and push costs onto consumers.\n\nIf she were to succeed in repealing the tax, the Congressional Budget Office has said that, without such a tax, the Affordable Care Act might not actually reduce health care costs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "About seven months after Hillary Clinton announced that she'd run for president in the 2016 election -- and years after the press began predicting that she'd win the Democratic nomination\u00a0-- the...", "original-source": "http://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/9-ways-hillary-clintons-financial-plan-affect-wallet/", "og": {"site_name": "GOBankingRates", "description": "About seven months after Hillary Clinton announced that she'd run for president in the 2016 election -- and years after the press began predicting that she'd win the Democratic nomination\u00a0-- the former secretary of state\u00a0has begun to formally lay out her proposed economic policy for the country.
