Therefore, we don't know what progress we've missed since we haven't funded it,\u201d Lowy said.\n\nLowy said cancer funding has peaked while research gets more expensive, and that government funding is important but they need to look more into private funding sources, too.\n\nMoffitt Cancer Center and the American Association for Cancer Research co-hosted the \u201cCancer Research Policy Forum: Progress, Promise and Challenges in the Era of Precision Medicine.\u201d\n\nA group of panelists discussed progress being made in cancer research and treatment, the importance of robust and predictable increases in funding for the National Institutes of Health, and special initiatives, such as the national cancer initiative to be led by Vice President Joe Biden, and the Administration\u2019s Precision Medicine Initiative.\n\nFeatured Speakers included:\n\nDouglas R.
