SPOTTED: Singer-songwriter Carole King trading music for a map Wednesday in Rep. Carolyn Maloney’s (D-N.Y.) office, as she advocated for the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act.

King, who pointed out wild lands across five states she indicated would benefit, has been pushing for the bill since it was first introduced in 1992.

“It’s been around for a long time, but it’s worthy. And it will pass,” the musician told ITK with a smile.

Maloney said King is “not only a great singer, she’s also a great environmentalist.”

“An important part of her life,” the congresswoman said of the 73-year-old Idaho resident, “is passing this bill and making sure this beautiful part of America is preserved for generations to come.”

“I’ve spent literally half my time, literally, when I’m not in the entertainment business or just being at home or whatever, I’m on the Hill or making calls for this cause,” King said. The Grammy winner — whose life is the subject of a musical, “Beautiful,” currently playing on Broadway — exclaimed, “It’s a very worthy cause. This should happen, and I do believe that tenacity counts. Not going away matters.”
