(AP Photo/Jeffrey R. Staab)\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: Happy Labor Day, and welcome to a special edition of The Daily 202.\n\n\u2014 Nine months after his Comedy Central show went off the air, Stephen Colbert\u2019s new \u201cLate Show\u201d debuts on CBS tomorrow at 11:35 p.m. Eastern. Jeb Bush will be Colbert\u2019s first guest in the remodeled Ed Sullivan Theater, signaling that Colbert plans to be a major force in humor about the 2016 presidential race even as he ditches the conservative character that catapulted him to stardom.\n\nColbert hit the press circuit hard in recent weeks. The result is dozens of positive pieces previewing his highly-anticipated move from cable to network television, including Time and GQ cover stories. Much of the coverage grapples with his attempt to appeal to a more mainstream audience. Here are some telling nuggets:\n\nColbert felt smothered by the need to act like \u201cStephen Colbert\u201d during the final seasons of his old show: He got frustrated by constantly translating everything through his character\u2019s faux ignorance. \u201cMy show was almost always an argument with someone who wasn\u2019t there,\u201d he told the New York Times. \u201cI had to be karate-yes or karate-no. I couldn\u2019t be karate-maybe on anything. \u2026 The story is either \u2018transformative president\u2019 or \u2018subversive president,\u2019 but that nails you in the same direction, emotionally. It\u2019s always either attack or defense, but on one issue. Everything was channeled through the president.\u201d\n\nHe got frustrated by constantly translating everything through his character\u2019s faux ignorance. \u201cMy show was almost always an argument with someone who wasn\u2019t there,\u201d he told the New York Times. \u201cI had to be karate-yes or karate-no.

It\u2019s always either attack or defense, but on one issue. Everything was channeled through the president.\u201d But while he\u2019s dropping the mask, he still plans to talk plenty about politics. \u201cIt\u2019s combed into our DNA after the last 10 years,\u201d he told TV critics. He got Mitt Romney to cut a promotional ad and lampooned Donald Trump in a viral video earlier this summer. \u201cI\u2019m not just a pundit \u2013 I\u2019m a comedian,\u201d he said in an interview with CBS \u201cSunday Morning.\u201d \u201cThe goal is to have fun with my friends, and that means sometimes talking about things that you care about. We\u2019re going to want to be talking about what\u2019s going on in the world.\u201d (Watch the 11-minute package here.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s combed into our DNA after the last 10 years,\u201d he told TV critics.

Colbert\u2019s early guests suggest he will book lots of political types: Besides Jeb tomorrow, he has Joe Biden on Thursday, Justice Stephen Breyer next Monday, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon next Thursday and then Bernie Sanders next Friday. He\u2019s also got Tesla\u2019s CEO, Uber\u2019s CEO and Kevin Spacey from \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d in the first two weeks.\n\nBesides Jeb tomorrow, he has Joe Biden on Thursday, Justice Stephen Breyer next Monday, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon next Thursday and then Bernie Sanders next Friday. He\u2019s also got Tesla\u2019s CEO, Uber\u2019s CEO and Kevin Spacey from \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d in the first two weeks. CBS execs want Colbert to do political humor. It\u2019s one of the reasons the network picked him, according to CBS President Leslie Moonves. It will differentiate him from others in the 11:30 timeslot just as 2016 is heating up. \u201cFrankly, that\u2019s not what Fallon or Kimmel does, particularly,\u201d Moonves told Dave Itzkoff. Much of Colbert\u2019s staff came with him from Comedy Central, including, importantly, most of the writers. There\u2019s only a few holdovers from Letterman\u2019s team, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch notes.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the reasons the network picked him, according to CBS President Leslie Moonves.

Jimmy Fallon has booked Trump for Friday night.\n\nJimmy Fallon has booked Trump for Friday night. But there\u2019s risk in being too political. Jon Stewart went off the airwaves last month, and his South African replacement isn\u2019t that interested in U.S. politics or mocking Fox News, leaving a real vacuum. But the Los Angeles Times notes \u201cthere is danger in being too highbrow \u2014 the equivalent of \u2018Charlie Rose\u2019 with more laughs \u2014 especially given that Colbert\u2019s rivals have had a long time to establish themselves creatively and to find an audience.\u201d Speaking to the paper, Robert Morton, a former Letterman executive producer, compared Colbert to Jack Paar, the \u201cTonight Show\u201d host who interviewed the likes of Albert Schweitzer, Robert F. Kennedy and Fidel Castro.\n\nColbert testifying before Congress in 2010 (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\n\nFour other interesting themes emerged from the blizzard of Colbert coverage:\n\nThe loss of Colbert\u2019s father and two brothers in a plane crash, when he was 10, heavily shaped his worldview. \u201cIt\u2019s built into me the way marble is built into a statue,\u201d he said on Howard Stern\u2019s show. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of, at a certain age, what I was made of.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s built into me the way marble is built into a statue,\u201d he said on Howard Stern\u2019s show. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of, at a certain age, what I was made of.\u201d Colbert relishes taking his guests out of their comfort zone. He\u2019s the opposite of most late-night hosts, who want everyone to have fun. \u201cI just want to do things that scratch an itch for me,\u201d he told GQ. \u201cThat itch is often something that feels wrong. It\u2019s wrong because it breaks convention or is unexpected or at times uncomfortable. I like that feeling.\u201d The central tension in his life, he added, is between being a \u201creasonably friendly, good-at-a-cocktail-party guy\u201d and walking around the world feeling like he\u2019s not quite a part of it: \u201cI like to do things that are publicly embarrassing, to feel the embarrassment touch me and sink into me and then be gone.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s the opposite of most late-night hosts, who want everyone to have fun. \u201cI just want to do things that scratch an itch for me,\u201d he told GQ. \u201cThat itch is often something that feels wrong.

And, finally, there\u2019s the South-Carolina-boy-made-good angle. The Post and Courier, highlighting Colbert\u2019s ties to the state with the first Southern primary, describes him as \u201cthe most successful celebrity to come out of Charleston in modern times \u2014 likely ever.\u201d Colbert flew down this June after the church shooting left nine dead, walking with thousands of community members across the Arthur Ravenel Bridge during the Bridge to Peace Unity Chain. \u201cColbert also returned to Charleston in 2013 to campaign for his sister, Elizabeth Colbert Busch, who ran for South Carolina\u2019s 1st Congressional District seat in a special election. She lost to Republican Mark Sanford. He\u2019s supported many local causes, particularly education. Just this year, he donated $800,000 to fund nearly 1,000 projects at statewide schools.\u201d\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n\u2014 President Obama is poised to sign an executive order in Boston requiring federal contractors to offer employees up to seven paid sick days a year, a move that could benefit more than 300,000 workers. The announcement will come momentarily during a Labor Day speech in Boston, part of an effort to push Congress to approve legislation that would provide similar benefits for millions of private sector workers. \u201cThe president\u2019s trip aims to highlight a Massachusetts law, approved by voters in November, that provides employees with up to 40 hours of sick leave per year,\u201d David Nakamura reports. \u201cAn estimated 44 million private sector workers \u2014 about 40 percent of the workforce \u2014 do not have access to paid sick leave, according to the White House.\u201d\n\nGET SMART FAST:\n\nPope Francis called on \u201cevery\u201d parish, religious community, monastery and sanctuary in Europe to take in one refugee family \u2014 an appeal that, if honored, would offer shelter to tens of thousands. (Anthony Faiola and Michael Birnbaum) It is not just Syrians any more. Germany\u2019s welcome of refugees has encouraged and emboldened people in other violent and impoverished countries, namely Iraq, to try the perilous sea crossing to Greece. (Liz Sly reports from Turkey) Lawyers for Kentucky clerk Kim Davis have filed an appeal challenging a judge finding her in contempt for refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses. (Courier-Journal) In Las Vegas, a man is in custody after allegedly walking up to a police SUV as it sat at a stoplight and shooting at a pair of officers with a semi-automatic handgun. One of the officers was struck in the right hand but is expected to recover. (Review-Journal) \u201cThe Iraqi military has used the F-16 fighter jet in combat operations for the first time, more than a year after Iraqi officials began pressing Washington to deliver them to assist in the fight against Islamic State militants,\u201d Dan Lamothe reports. Washington state\u2019s charter school law, which narrowly passed in a 2012 referendum with financial support from Bill Gates, has been struck down as unconstitutional by the state\u2019s Supreme Court. The U.S. Army has launched an investigation after an annual pillow fight among students at West Point led to injuries ranging from broken bones to concussions. Twenty-four cadets were diagnosed with concussions, and other injuries included a broken nose, a dislocated shoulder and a hairline fracture to the cheekbone of one of the concussed cadets, Army officials said in a statement. (Dan Lamothe) Hillary Clinton and her family personally paid a State Department staffer to maintain the private e-mail server she used while heading the agency, an unusual arrangement that allowed her to retain control. Republican lawmakers are now considering an offer of immunity to the IT staffer who declared his intention to plead the Fifth. (Rosalind S. Helderman and Carol D. Leonnig) Those five Chinese Naval vessels that approached Alaska during President Obama\u2019s trip to the state last week came within 12 nautical miles of American soil. They were there for a joint Russian-Chinese military exercise. Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign will spend $500,000 on ads in New Hampshire between Wednesday and the end of the month. The first spot will highlight his conservative record as governor of Florida. That\u2019s in addition to the $11 million that the Bush super PAC plans to spend in the state from September through December.\n\nPOWER PLAYERS IN THE NEWS:\n\nDNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz choked up as she endorsed the Iran deal during an interview on CNN. She called it the most difficult decision she\u2019s made in politics. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing more important to me as a Jew than to ensure that Israel\u2019s existence is there throughout our generations,\u201d she said. Colin Powell also endorsed the deal on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d something welcomed by the White House after Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, came out against it Friday. Rep. Dave Loebsack, the only Democratic member of Iowa\u2019s congressional delegation, will endorse Hillary at a Labor Day picnic today. (Quad-Cities Times) Mary Pawlenty, Tim\u2019s wife and Minnesota\u2019s former first lady, is weighing a run for the House seat opening up with John Kline\u2019s retirement. (AP) Bernie Sanders joined a picket line in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, outside a plant that produces potato starches. The union is in a contract dispute with new owners, and the Vermont senator wants to highlight his ties to organized labor. Martin O\u2019Malley called on the U.S. should accept at least 65,000 Syrian refufees next year. Harvard Law Professor Larry Lessig announced that he\u2019s definitely running for president on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d hoping to draw attention to problems in the campaign finance system. Jeb will be in D.C. to see the Pope on Sept. 23. He and his wife plan to attend the mass at which Francis canonizes Junipero Serra, who founded the missions in California.\n\nWAPO HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n\u2014 \u201cA hands-off Democratic race: Clinton, Sanders won\u2019t speak ill of each other,\u201d by Philip Rucker and John Wagner: NBC/Marist polling released yesterday showed Bernie Sanders leading Hillary by 9 points in New Hampshire (41-32) while Hillary leads by 11 points in Iowa (38-27). Neither mentions the other publicly. Here\u2019s the calculus of each camp:\n\nSanders has calculated that to beat Clinton, he must expand the electorate \u2014 and going negative will turn off too many potentially new voters.\n\nClinton cannot afford to alienate impassioned Sanders supporters; should she win the Democratic nomination, she will need their votes and enthusiasm in the general election. Elevating him would help his fundraising and make her look panicked. Plus, Hillary\u2019 surrogates can do the dirty work. If the race is still tight closer to the caucuses, she can always run blistering attack ads.\n\n\u2014 \u201cAn American family saved their son from joining the Islamic State. Now he might go to prison,\u201d by Adam Goldman: \u201cAsher Abid Khan sat in Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk Airport and considered his next move \u2014 forward to Syria and enlistment in the Islamic State, the militant group that had drawn him to the possibility of dying for Allah, or home to Texas and his bewildered family whose imploring messages were filling his voice mail\u2026Hours later, without ever leaving the airport, Khan boarded a plane and flew home to this Houston suburb\u2026Fifteen months later, in May 2015, the FBI charged Khan with conspiracy and attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State. Instead of life inside the caliphate, Khan, now faces up to 30 years in prison.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nIn honor of Labor Day, we\u2019re bringing you one big round-up of what candidates and lawmakers were up to this weekend:\n\nGOOD READS FROM ELSEWHERE:\n\n\u2014 New York Times, \u201cJeb Bush, family ties and a museum that never materialized,\u201d by Steve Eder: \u201cWhen Jeb Bush set out to build a political base of his own in South Florida three decades ago, he did not lack for new friends. He was a magnet for a long line of Republicans eager to be associated with him and his powerful family, including a Cuban immigrant and former corrections officer named Tony Campos\u2026But Mr. Campos\u2019s interests in the family were not entirely innocent. Ultimately he would try to exploit those relationships, entangling Jeb Bush, by then the governor of Florida, in a case of misplaced trust and the theft of public funds.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Des Moines Register: \u201cThe labor vote is still lucrative in Iowa,\u201d by Grant Rodgers: The \u201cinfluence wielded by unions comes despite declines in the number of Iowa workers who belong to a union. In 1984, 17 percent of Iowa workers were union members compared with 10 percent in 2014, according to unionstats.com, a database maintained by two university professors\u2026But even if enrollment is down, the messages organized labor has pushed about threats to working families and the middle class are resonating in the conversation in the race for the 2016 Democratic nomination, said Charlie Wishman, secretary/treasurer of the Iowa Federation of Labor. For instance, all of the Democratic candidates have championed a minimum wage increase in some form.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Minneapolis Star-Tribune: \u201cWalter Palmer speaks: Hunter who killed [Cecil the lion] will resume Bloomington dental practice Tuesday,\u201d by Paul Walsh: \u201cPalmer declined to address whether he would abide by any request, either informal or through extradition proceedings, to return to Zimbabwe to answer legal allegations. \u2018I have a lot of staff members, and I\u2019m a little heartbroken at the disruption in their lives,\u2019 said the casually dressed Palmer, calm and all business, during the back and forth as attorney Joe Friedberg and a public relations consultant flanked him in what the dentist said would be his only media availability. \u2018And I\u2019m a health professional. I need to get back to my staff and my patients, and they want me back. That\u2019s why I\u2019m back\u2019\u2026Palmer added: \u2018This has been especially hard on my wife and my daughter,\u2019 he said\u2026\u2019They\u2019ve been threatened in the social media, and again \u2026 I don\u2019t understand that level of humanity to come after people not involved at all.\u2019\n\n\u2014 Los Angeles Times, \u201cU.S. builds up Arctic spy network as Russia and China increase presence,\u201d by Brian Bennett and W.J. Hennigan: \u201cOver the last 14 months, most of the 16 U.S. intelligence agencies have assigned analysts to work full time on the Arctic. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence recently convened a \u201cstrategy board\u201d to bring the analysts together to share their findings\u2026The growing focus shows how the United States and other polar powers are adjusting as global warming opens new sea lanes and sets off a scramble for largely untapped reserves of oil, natural gas and minerals. The United States, Russia, Canada, Denmark and Norway are pursuing jurisdiction over the Arctic seabed.\u201d\n\n\u2014 CNET, \u201c\u2018El Chapo\u2019 Guzman\u2019s son said to have tweeted out his location,\u201d by Chris Matyszczyk: \u201cThe head of the Sinaloa drug cartel, Joaqu\u00edn Archivaldo Guzman Loera, known as \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman, is on the run after escaping in July through tunnels beneath the Mexican prison in which he was held. But where is he now? Costa Rica\u2019s ICR News believes it may have a clue. It espied a tweet sent on August 31 from an account that claims to be Guzman\u2019s son, 29-year-old Jes\u00fas Alfredo Guzm\u00e1n Salazar. The tweet included a picture of Guzman Jr. with what may have been his dad. The message roughly translated to: \u2018Satisfied here, you already know with whom\u2019\u2026The location of the tweet was marked as \u201cCosta Rica,\u201d which could mean the country or the village of Costa Rica, Culiacan. This happens to be in Sinaloa, Mexico.\u201d\n\nHOT ON THE LEFT\n\nSnowden attacks Russia rights curbs as \u2018fundamentally wrong.\u2019 From Agence France-Presse: \u201cFormer U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden \u2014 who has been granted asylum by Russia \u2014 criticized the country\u2019s crackdown on human rights and online freedom Saturday as \u2018wrong \u2026 disappointing and frustrating.\u2019 Snowden called Moscow\u2019s restrictions on the web \u201ca mistake in policy\u201d and \u201cfundamentally wrong\u201d as he accepted a Norwegian freedom of expression prize by videophone from Russia. It\u2019s wrong in Russia, and it would be wrong anywhere,\u2019 said Snowden.\u201d\n\nHOT ON THE RIGHT\n\nFox News anchor sues Hasbro over toy hamster with her name. From the Associated Press: \u201cAn anchor for Fox News is suing Hasbro for more than $5 million over a toy hamster that shares her name \u2014 and possibly even her resemblance. Harris Faulkner sued Hasbro this week over its plastic Harris Faulkner hamster, sold as part of the Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based company\u2019s popular Littlest Pet Shop line. She says the toy wrongfully appropriates her name and persona, harms her professional credibility as a journalist and is an insult.\u201d\n\nDAYBOOK:\n\n\u2013What\u2019s happening today on the campaign trail: Hillary Clinton stops by labor events in Cedar Rapids, Hampton and Burlington, Iowa.
