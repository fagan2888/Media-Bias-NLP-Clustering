Is Toni overwhelmed by the Captain\u2019s disease? Is she abandoning the man she once called \u2018The Love of Her Life?\u2019 Or, is the divorce a matter of financial convenience because of health insurance issues caused by new Obamacare regulations?\n\nA CBS New York report from November of last year cited the fact that Obamacare actually has stipulations that some refer to as a \u2018marriage penalty\u2019 where health insurance is actually cheaper if you\u2019re divorced. The story features a NYC couple, Nona Willis Aronowitz and Aaron Cassara, who would actually save a substantial amount of money on health care if they were single.\n\nTMZ posed the question:\n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s unclear \u2014 whether it\u2019s possible Toni really filed for health insurance reasons \u2026 whether his coverage might be better if they were divorced.\n\nThe Captain and Tennille Fan website disclosed last week that Toni Tennille met with a divorce attorney in Phoenix. Friends of the couple told the Enquirer that the they moved to their dream home in Prescott, Arizona in 2008 and shortly thereafter, 71-year-old \u201cCaptain\u201d Daryl Dragon became seriously ill. The Enquirer reported that he suffers from tremors caused by a form of Parkinson\u2019s Disease, which makes it difficult to perform with his 73-year-old wife on stage.\n\nThe couple tied the knot in 1978, the same year their first album debuted on the national charts. Their ABC hit television program would soon follow and the rest is history, with hits like \u2018Do That to Me One More Time,\u2019 \u2018Muskrat Love\u2019 and, yes, the classic \u201cLove Will Keep Us Together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why she filed. I gotta figure it out for myself first,\u201d Daryl told TMZ. He also said they\u2019re still living together in the same house, according to the tabloid.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/wibx950.com/files/2014/01/53295920.jpg", "sailthru.author": "keeler", "description": "Divorce for 70's pop couple 'Captain and Tennille' shocked fans and friends; but, is it really a divorce of convenience due to Obamacare?", "og": {"site_name": "WIBX 950", "description": "Divorce for 70's pop couple 'Captain and Tennille' shocked fans and friends; but, is it really a divorce of convenience due to Obamacare?", "title": "Obamacare Causes 'Captain and Tennille' Divorce?", "url": "http://wibx950.com/captain-and-tennille-divorce-victims-of-obamacare/", "image": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/wibx950.com/files/2014/01/53295920.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"site": "@WIBXnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-22 21:43:03", "sailthru.title": "Captain and Tennille Divorce- Victims of Obamacare?", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-wibx, tsmmarket-utica, tsmtype-local, 1970s, captain-and-tennille, divorce, healthcare, marriage, obamacare, morning-show, national-news", "fb": {"admins": 732998853, "app_id": 131969373539887}, "keywords": "captain and tennille, captain and tennille getting a divorce because, who is captain and, who are captain and, captain and tennille divorce, obama caused captain and tennille, rush, limbaugh, glenn, beck, hannity, affordable healthcare act, captain & tennille divorce, tensile, why are captain and tennille getting divorced, toni, tennille, darryl, dragon, love will keep us together, muskrat love, 70's duo splits", "sailthru.description": "Divorce for 70's pop couple 'Captain and Tennille' shocked fans and friends; but, is it really a divorce of convenience due to Obamacare?", "sailthru.image.full": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/wibx950.com/files/2014/01/53295920.jpg", "viewport": "width=1020"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7de\"", "article_summary": "The Captain and Tennille Fan website disclosed last week that Toni Tennille met with a divorce attorney in Phoenix.\n(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)Nobody can seem to figure out why after all these years, 70\u2019s pop duo \u2018Captain and Tennille\u2019 is getting a divorce.\nIs she abandoning the man she once called \u2018The Love of Her Life?\u2019 Or, is the divorce a matter of financial convenience because of health insurance issues caused by new Obamacare regulations?\nFriends of the couple told the Enquirer that the they moved to their dream home in Prescott, Arizona in 2008 and shortly thereafter, 71-year-old \u201cCaptain\u201d Daryl Dragon became seriously ill.\nTMZ posed the question:Here\u2019s what\u2019s unclear \u2014 whether it\u2019s possible Toni really filed for health insurance reasons \u2026 whether his coverage might be better if they were divorced."}
