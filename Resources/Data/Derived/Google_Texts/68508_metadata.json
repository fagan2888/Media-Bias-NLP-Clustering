Over the next several weeks, founders Patrick Ruffini and Kristen Soltis Anderson will produce the Echelon Digital Index\u2014a measure of digital activity that includes volume of Internet searches, visits to a candidate\u2019s Wikipedia page and engagement on social media.\n\nIn an era when fewer Americans are getting their news from traditional media outlets, Echelon wants to capture real-time data to analyze public opinion.\n\n\u201cDigital metrics like search interest and social media mentions by voters are an important indicator that can help tell a story beyond the toplines of a poll,\u201d Ruffini told The Daily Signal, adding:\n\nWhich candidate is the election \u2018about\u2019? Is a challenger well known or not? Who seems to have the momentum? Is there potential instability in the dynamics of a race? Digital metrics can help us answer those questions. We think it\u2019s important to look at these side by side with polling to tell a meaningful story about what\u2019s really happening on the ground.\n\nThe Echelon Digital Index is tracking seven U.S. Senate races (Republicans need to win six to take control of the upper chamber). Seven charts, released at 9 a.m. today, are below.\n\nSo what does it all mean?\n\nRuffini noted that in some cases, such as Alaska and Louisiana, Republican challengers are behind on the index but ahead in public opinion polls. That\u2019s an indication voters are rejecting incumbents even though the challengers aren\u2019t generating as much buzz. He\u2019ll be watching for sudden shifts on the index as an indicator of how the dynamics of a race might change.\n\nIn unveiling the index yesterday, Ruffini cited three patterns he\u2019s already spotted:\n\n1) The Power of Incumbency: \u201cIncumbents tend to have a natural advantage in their respective race index, since they are better known and re-election races tend to be a referendum on the incumbent,\u201d Ruffini wrote. One exception is Rep. Tom Cotton, the Republican challenger in Arkansas, who has done the best job of defining himself. But in Louisiana, Rep. Bill Cassidy, who is facing another Republican in the Nov. 4 election and an advertising onslaught from Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, runs far behind in the index. Cassidy, however, maintains a lead in most polls.\n\n2) First-Time Impressions: Echelon\u2019s index reveals what happens when voters seek out information on challengers such as Republicans Cory Gardner of Colorado and Joni Ernst of Iowa and independent Greg Orman of Kansas. \u201cWhile well-known figures tend to have an advantage in search trends; searches can spike the most when voters are learning about a candidate for the first time,\u201d Ruffini wrote.\n\n3) Positive Ads Create Buzz: Citing an example from North Carolina, Ruffini notes that Republican Thom Tillis, although trailing in the index and most polls, drove attention to his campaign in mid-August with a positive ad with the candidate talking directly to the camera. \u201c[H]is first positive ads on the general election on Aug. 17 caused his index score to spike from 29 to 45 within three days and gave him a sustained 10-point bump in share of online attention,\u201d Ruffini noted.\n\nEchelon will publish updates to its Digital Index on Twitter (search the hashtag #EDX2014) or follow @EchelonInsights.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What can a Google search or Twitter mention tell us about a political race?
