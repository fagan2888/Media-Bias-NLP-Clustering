John Hickenlooper in November.\n\n\u201cWhy are outside Democrat influences spending hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to get Tom Tancredo elected in a primary?\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator asks. \u201cBecause they know that Tom Tancredo cannot beat John Hickenlooper.\n\n\u201cThey also know that one Republican primary candidate can \u2013 Bob Beauprez. And they\u2019ll spend whatever it takes to stop him.\n\n\u201cSo who would you rather support? The candidate the Democrats are pushing? Or Bob Beauprez, the candidates that Democrats fear?\u201d\n\nTancredo remains the favorite to win the June 24 primary given his lead in most polls, deep base of support and the fact that there are three other options on the ballot who will likely split the anti-Tancredo vote (a circumstance Tancredo\u2019s campaign helped engineer in April by instructing supporters to help Mike Kopp make the ballot at the state GOP assembly after Tancredo had already petitioned onto the primary ballot).\n\nBeauprez, in an effort to prevail, is fighting on two fronts \u2014 to convince voters that the guy in front of him, Tancredo, can\u2019t win in November; and that voting for either candidate running behind him in the polls will likely split the vote and ensure Tancredo is the party\u2019s nominee.", "article_metadata": {"description": "DENVER -- The newly-formed independent expenditure group \"Republicans Want to Win\", which is backing GOP gubernatorial hopeful Bob Beauprez, is on the air with a TV ad that hits back at another newly-formed independent expenditure group's ads that are a thinly-veiled attempt by Democrats to tip the ...", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=334627011", "og": {"site_name": "FOX31 Denver", "description": "DENVER \u2014 The newly-formed independent expenditure group \u201cRepublicans Want to Win\u201d, which is backing GOP gubernatorial hopeful Bob Beauprez, is on the air with a TV ad that hits ba\u2026", "title": "Pro-Beauprez 527 hits back over Democrats\u2019 primary \u201cmeddling\u201d", "url": "http://kdvr.com/2014/06/12/pro-beauprez-527-hits-back-over-democrats-primary-meddling/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tancredoad.jpg", "height": 349}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/tancredoad.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@kdvr", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kdvr"}, "keywords": "politics,", "msapplication-tooltip": "Denver, Colorado News, Weather, Sports and more", "p": {"domain_verify": "5873d9988d745234e5abf9cff7ed939d"}, "fb": {"pages": 90018331599}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "application-name": "FOX31 Denver", "google-site-verification": "AmrqnQj74ngNWI1vn6WwMZyy9IWy4ZqooGuxLtd7lIs", "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox31denver", "published_time": "2014-06-12T20:47:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-12T20:47:00+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox31denver"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://kdvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/17e52d5bd05a36821dc7d1d5f90e105c?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf643\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey also know that one Republican primary candidate can \u2013 Bob Beauprez.\n\u00d7 Pro-Beauprez 527 hits back over Democrats\u2019 primary \u201cmeddling\u201dDENVER \u2014 The newly-formed independent expenditure group \u201cRepublicans Want to Win\u201d, which is backing GOP gubernatorial hopeful Bob Beauprez, is on the air with a TV ad that hits back at another newly-formed independent expenditure group\u2019s ads that are a thinly-veiled attempt by Democrats to tip the primary to Tom Tancredo.\n\u201cWhy are outside Democrat influences spending hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to get Tom Tancredo elected in a primary?\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator asks.\n\u201cBecause they know that Tom Tancredo cannot beat John Hickenlooper.\nThe candidate the Democrats are pushing?"}
