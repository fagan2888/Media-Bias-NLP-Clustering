But it wasn\u2019t until the 20th century that Western societies embraced it and began studying its physical effects. Now, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that more than 10 percent of you meditate at least occasionally (that\u2019s more than 30 million \u201cOms\u201d in North America alone).\n\nWe\u2019re great advocates of mindfulness meditation (we both do it daily) and find that it reduces the stress response, refreshes the body and makes it easier to sort out tasks and thoughts. (For instructions on how to start meditating, visit sharecare.com.) And we\u2019re glad that recent studies have shown that meditation can help women overcome fertility problems; lower blood pressure; relieve anxiety and depression; and ease pain and increase mobility in folks with arthritis. As we gain more understanding of the effects of meditation, we may find there are even more and more applications. Now we are starting to understand the science behind meditation. Using imaging and electrodes, researchers have discovered that, like biofeedback, meditation lets folks manipulate their brain\u2019s alpha and beta waves\u2019 rhythm, blocking out distractions or negative thoughts. Mindfulness practitioners seem to diminish their fightor- flight response centers and are more likely to utilize brain areas that control more rational thoughts. And a recent study found that long-term practice protects the brain\u2019s gray matter from age-related atrophy!\n\nSo whether you enjoy meditating for the calm it brings you or you\u2019re using it to help relieve a specific condition, the scientific evidence is growing that the benefits are more than ethereal. Say OM!\n\nQ: I just saw the movie \u201cStill Alice\u201d about a 50-year-old woman with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and it made it all seem so hopeless. Is research turning up anything to help prevent or treat the problem? \u2014 Susan D., Colorado Springs, Colorado\n\nA: As Alice Howland in \u201cStill Alice,\u201d Julianne Moore\u2019s Academy Award-winning performance vividly portrays the hardships and heartbreak of early-onset Alzheimer\u2019s, as her character\u2019s once-rich intellectual and emotional life slips out of her grip.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a tale that personally touches the lives of many of you these days. An estimated 5.2 million North Americans have Alzheimer\u2019s disease; 200,000 are 65 or younger.\n\nBy 2050, it\u2019s estimated that more than 13.5 million people in North America will be living with Alzheimer\u2019s. Fortunately, many researchers around the world are trying to improve diagnosis and treatments. Here are some recent breakthroughs:\n\n\u25a0 Diagnosis: For years, only an autopsy could positively diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nNow researchers are using brain scans to predict the onset of Alzheimer\u2019s at its earliest stages. In one experiment, scientists at Duke University used an MRI technique called diffusion tensor imaging to reveal changes in the functioning of the brain\u2019s white matter.\n\nIn another experiment, researchers used an MRI probe to track a super-tiny magnetized substance paired with an antibody that seeks out the earliest development of Alzheimer\u2019s-associated amyloid beta brain toxins.\n\n\u25a0 Treatment: To stop progressive brain damage, Danish researchers recently implanted nerve growth factor into the brain of a few people with Alzheimer\u2019s, and it seemed to prevent further degradation of nerve function. And scientists in University of Southern California have found a way to harness the immune system that may help the body clear away brain-fogging toxic plaque associated with Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nThese are innovative and potentially gamechanging experiments. Until these discoveries and others produce concrete therapies, the best brain protection you can have is to maintain a healthy weight, avoid inflammatory foods (like saturated and trans fats, added sugars and syrups, and processed carbohydrates), get plenty of physical activity (10,000 steps a day, no excuses!), stay engaged in learning \u2014 whether it\u2019s language, music or puzzles \u2014 and challenge yourself mentally every day.\n\nDr. Mehmet Oz is host of \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\u201d and Dr. Mike Roizen is chief medical officer at the Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute.
