It comes on the heels of a Feb. 26 letter from White House Budget Director Shaun Donovan declaring the crackdown a \u201ckey priority\u201d in the final two years of the Obama administration.\n\nRelated: Medicare Drug Program Still Plagued by Fraud\n\n\u201cWhile some progress has been made on this front, we believe a more aggressive strategy can be implemented to reduce the levels of improper payments were are currently seeing,\u201d Donovan said in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell that was obtained by The Center for Public Integrity, a watchdog group.\n\nA spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid said today that HHS and the Office of Management and Budget were working in tandem to address the costly problem.\n\nOverpayments by the Medicare and Medicare Advantage programs for seniors and Medicaid for low-income Americans have grown into a massive fiscal problem for the government and an endless source of public outrage over the vast scale of erroneous or fraudulent payouts to the medical profession.\n\nIn June, for example, a total of 16 people \u2013 including six doctors, a social worker and a pharmacist \u2013 were charged by federal prosecutors in Detroit in connection with a Medicare healthcare fraud and kickback scheme throughout Southeastern Michigan. The charges included doctors submitting fraudulent claims for services that were not necessary or that never were provided.\n\nThat same month, the federal government was under attack for having handed out hundreds of millions in erroneous benefits after the disclosure that about 200 people received $10 million worth of Medicaid benefits despite the fact they had been dead for years. The Government Accountability Office\u2019s latest report on improper payments found \u2013 among other things \u2013 that in 2011, four states reported that at least 8,600 people received double benefits from different states \u2013 in effect bilking the government of about $18.3 million.\n\nRelated: The Government\u2019s $125 Billion Slap in the Face to Taxpayers\n\nOverall last year, Medicaid programs were stung by an estimated improper-payment rate of 6.7 percent, or $17.5 billion \u2013 an increase over the 2013 estimate of 5.8 percent, or $14.4 billion, as The Fiscal Times previously reported.\n\nMeanwhile, errors in Medicare fee-for-service billings rose by 2.62 percent in fiscal 2014, at a cost of $9.7 billion more than the previous year, according to Donovan\u2019s letter. The director of the Office of Management and Budget noted that some progress had been made in reducing Medicare Advantage payment mistakes but added that the estimated $12.2 billion in mistakes for fiscal 2014 \u201cremains a concern,\u201d according to his letter.\n\nThe Center for Public Integrity revealed last year that government officials made nearly $70 billion worth of improper payments to Medicare Advantage plans for wealthier Americans between 2008 and 2013 because of overbillings. Medicare Advantage includes health maintenance organizations and private fee-for-service programs.\n\nIn his letter, Donovan instructed health officials to develop a comprehensive corrective action plan by April 30 that spells out the \u201croot causes\u201d of the problem and provides innovative ways of cracking down on overpayments. He also sought a plan to improve the integrity of the Affordable Care Act program to \u201cinsure payment accuracy.\u201d\n\nRelated: $Millions in Medicaid Benefits Flow to Dead People\n\nAaron Albright, director of media relations for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said today that the Health and Human Services Department \u201cmet both outlined response deadlines and has worked to reduce improper payments associated with inaccurate Medicare Advantage diagnosis data. CMS has recovered $13.7 million from all 2007 audits of the program.\n\n\u201cHHS and OMB are continuously working together to identify and reduce improper payments,\u201d Albright said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Alarmed by the tens of billions of dollars in Medicare and Medicaid fraud and overpaym", "title": "White House Takes Aim at Billions in Medicare and Medicaid Fraud", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/04/White-House-Takes-Aim-Billions-Medicare-and-Medicaid-Fraud", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02142011_medicare_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/09/04/White-House-Takes-Aim-Billions-Medicare-and-Medicaid-Fraud", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02142011_medicare_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Alarmed by the tens of billions of dollars in Medicare and Medicaid fraud and overpaym", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHHS and OMB are continuously working together to identify and reduce improper payments,\u201d Albright said in a statement.\nMedicare Advantage includes health maintenance organizations and private fee-for-service programs.\nThe effort includes a strict review of reporting procedures and a \u201ccomprehensive corrective action plan\u201d involving the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and law enforcement officials.\nA spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid said today that HHS and the Office of Management and Budget were working in tandem to address the costly problem.\nThe Center for Public Integrity revealed last year that government officials made nearly $70 billion worth of improper payments to Medicare Advantage plans for wealthier Americans between 2008 and 2013 because of overbillings."}
