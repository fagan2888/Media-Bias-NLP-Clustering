Left unaddressed, though, is a simple question: How does border security address the status of millions of undocumented immigrants currently in the United States?\n\nThe answer is that it probably won\u2019t, according to a person who knows a thing or two about immigration: Felipe Calderon.\n\nIn a recent interview, the former Mexican president told me that he believes the crackdown on undocumented immigration combined with intensified border security has prompted large numbers of undocumented Mexican laborers to remain in the U.S. permanently \u2014 even as many prefer to go home \u2014 out of fear they will never be able to return.\n\nCalderon, who was president from 2006 to 20012, characterized the primary motive of undocumented Mexican immigrants as economic. Many, he said, are simply seeking to stay in the U.S. for a few years to earn money before returning home with cash to build houses and support families. But, he added, the American border crackdown has made the crossing so treacherous and expensive, many unauthorized immigrants already in the U.S. are staying put.\n\n\u201cMany of them are currently trapped,\u201d Calderon told me. \u201cThere are a lot of these people [who] want to be in Mexico eight months every year, but they are unable to go there, because if they cross the border, they will never be able to cross back again.\u201d\n\nCalderon said he believes U.S. lawmakers should consider adding provisions to proposed immigration legislation that would permit \u201ctemporary work in a massive way,\u201d but without giving immigrants automatic citizenship.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe that most of the Mexican workers looking for a job in the United States are wanting to be American citizens,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey are looking for an opportunity to get economic benefits and actually thinking when they are leaving [Mexico] what will be the way in which they can go back to their own home.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "How does border security address the status of millions of undocumented immigrants in the U.S.?
