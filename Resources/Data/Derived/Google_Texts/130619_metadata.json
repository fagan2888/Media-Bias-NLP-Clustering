I visited at a time when Venus was situated quite close to the centre of the Milky Way; an astronomical event that only takes place every 8 years or so. I also timed my visit with the Autumn equinox which is a good time of year to capture Zodiacal light; the celestial phenomenon caused by sunlight scattering interplanetary space dust in the Zodiacal cloud. It stretches across the ecliptic and glows for a short while after sunset like a UFO beam and I was lucky enough to witness this every night I stepped out into the dark.\u201d\n\nRELATED: It\u2019s an Equinox Thing: Springtime Zodiacal Light Is Magical at Dusk [Video]\n\nThere are about 21,000 Atacame\u00f1o people living in Chile today, according to the website Indigenous News, which focuses on Chilean Indigenous Peoples. They have lived what is today the northern part of Chile for thousands of years, originating as early as 9000 B.C. Though starting out as hunter-gatherers, they soon became farmers and raised llamas, the site says.\n\nThese cultures are still vibrant today, celebrating numerous holidays and festivals, according to Lonely Planet.\n\n\u201cIndigenous pre-Columbian tribes like the Aymara and Atacame\u00f1o inhabited the arid landscape long before Spanish settlers arrived in the 15th century\u2014and today, their descendants still celebrate ancestral traditions during lively regional festivals that allow visitors a glimpse into the past,\u201d Lonely Planet says. From the Winter Solstice of June 21 (which doubles as the New Year), to the La Fiesta de La Tirana (the feast of La Virgen del Carmen) in mid-July, the opportunities to appreciate and learn about these ancient cultures are rife.\n\nWe can start with Buer\u2019s stunning, ethereal interpretation of the skies.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Atacama Desert in Chile has been home to Indigenous Peoples of the same name for thousands of years.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/02/27/video-ancient-cycles-play-out-time-lapse-atacama-desert-skies-163548", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/atacama_desert-time_lapse-nicholas_buer-vimeo.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Video: Ancient Cycles Play Out in This Time-Lapse of the Atacama Desert Skies"}, "dcterms.date": "2016-02-27T10:30-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/02/27/video-ancient-cycles-play-out-time-lapse-atacama-desert-skies-163548", "dc": {"title": "Video: Ancient Cycles Play Out in This Time-Lapse of the Atacama Desert Skies"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Video: Ancient Cycles Play Out in This Time-Lapse of the Atacama Desert Skies"}, "article_summary": "The Atacama Desert in Chile has been home to Indigenous Peoples of the same name for thousands of years.\n\u201cThe Atacama is well-known for what are arguably the cleanest, darkest skies on Earth,\u201d he wrote in his Vimeo introduction.\n\u201cThis film follows the ancient cycle of sunset, to night, to sunrise,\u201d he wrote on his Vimeo page.\nThey have lived what is today the northern part of Chile for thousands of years, originating as early as 9000 B.C.\n\u201cThe dry air adds an extra transparency and this coupled with the altitude creates a night sky like no other."}
