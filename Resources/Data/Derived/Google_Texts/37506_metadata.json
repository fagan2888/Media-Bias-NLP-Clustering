Heavy clashes continued there over the past several days despite the ceasefire agreement that went into effect on Sunday. The Ukrainian military finally withdrew after suffering heavy casualties. The rebels claimed the ceasefire never applied to the town. In Washington, State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said that with the exception of the Debaltseve clashes, the ceasefire appears to have held in most other areas. Jen Psaki: \"Reports indicate that separatists publicly declared that they refused to observe the ceasefire in Debaltseve and had a, quote, 'right' to shell Debaltseve because it was, quote, 'their territory.' The OSCE reports that the Russia-backed separatists continue to deny monitors access to Debaltseve, and warns of grave consequences of those in the city if the ceasefire is not implemented there. The OSCE also confirms that ceasefire violations in Ukraine\u2019s east continue, as was the case yesterday, but the quantity and intensity of attacks has decreased, with the dramatic exception of course being Debaltseve, which I just outlined. We\u2019ve also seen reports of the withdrawal of certain types of heavy weapons in various parts of Donetsk and Luhansk by both separatists and Ukrainian government forces.\"\n\nGermany Rejects Greek Loan Extension as Austerity Standoff Deepens Greece has formally asked the eurozone for a six-month extension of a loan agreement as it seeks to revise the terms of an international bailout. Talks between Greece and its European creditors collapsed this week amid disagreement over the future of German-backed austerity. Greece had been given a Friday deadline to request a new extension of its bailout and loans. Germany has rejected Greece\u2019s demands, saying its extension request \"is not a substantial proposal for a solution.\" On Wednesday, the European Central Bank reportedly agreed to free up billions of dollars in emergency credit to Greek banks.\n\nTaliban, U.S. to Hold Qatar Peace Talks; Afghan Civilian Casualties Up 22% in 2014 Members of the Taliban in Afghanistan are reportedly set to hold a new round of peace talks with U.S. officials in Qatar. There is no firm timetable, but a Pakistani official said the negotiations could begin in March. The news comes as United Nations officials reported a 22 percent spike in Afghan civilian casualties last year. Nicholas Haysom, U.N. envoy in Afghanistan: \"Civilian causalities increased once again by 22 percent in comparison to those of 2013. UNAMA [United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan] documented more than 10,000 civilian causalities in 2014, the highest number of civilian deaths and injuries recorded in a single year since 2009.\" Georgette Gagnon, U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan: \"We saw a 40 percent increase in children causalities, with some 2,700 children killed and injured, compared to 2013 and an increase in women causalities by 21 percent, with some 300 women killed and 611 injured.\"\n\nObama Tells Extremism Summit ISIS Perverting Islamic Faith The White House is holding a summit on countering the threat of violent extremism worldwide. In a speech on Wednesday, President Obama called the Islamic State a perversion of Islam. President Obama: \"Al-Qaeda and ISIL, and groups like it, are desperate for legitimacy. They try to portray themselves as religious leaders, holy warriors in defense of Islam. That\u2019s why ISIL presumes to declare itself the Islamic State. And they propagate the notion that America \u2014 and the West, generally \u2014 is at war with Islam. That\u2019s how they recruit, that\u2019s how they try to radicalize young people. We must never accept the premise that they put forward, because it is a lie. Nor should we grant these terrorists the religious legitimacy that they seek. They are not religious leaders. They\u2019re terrorists.\"\n\nHeavy Blast at Exxon Refinery in California; Fire from West Virginia Train Derailment Continues An explosion at an ExxonMobil refinery south of Los Angeles has rocked the surrounding area with the equivalent of a 1.4-magnitute earthquake. The blast in California happened as oil tank cars from a derailed train remained on fire Wednesday in West Virginia, two days after the accident.

The protest came one month after the mysterious death of special prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who had accused Argentina\u2019s president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, of helping to cover up Iran\u2019s role in the deadly 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center that killed 85 people and injured hundreds.\n\nFormer Gitmo Prisoner David Hicks Seeks Damages for Torture as Military Court Overturns Conviction A military appeals court judge has overturned the 2007 conviction of former Guant\u00e1namo Bay prisoner David Hicks. Captured in Afghanistan, Hicks was held at Guant\u00e1namo for five years before reaching a plea deal to return to his native Australia. Hicks admitted to material support for terrorism and agreed to renounce his claim of suffering abuse in U.S. custody. Hicks had said he was sodomized, beaten and subjected to forced injections, allegations the military denied. He was the first Guant\u00e1namo prisoner convicted under the Military Commissions Act. Hicks appealed his case in 2013, saying his plea was made under duress. On Wednesday, Hicks\u2019 conviction was struck down on the grounds his lone charge wasn\u2019t recognized as a crime until years after his capture. On Wednesday, Hicks called on the United States to pay him compensation for medical damages resulting from his imprisonment and torture. David Hicks: \"I\u2019m sure no one is surprised by today\u2019s long-awaited acknowledgment by the government of the United States of America of my innocence. Even the Australian government has admitted that I had committed no crime. It\u2019s just unfortunate that because of politics, I was subjected to five-and-a-half years of physical and psychological torture that I will now live with always. \u2026 But I do think, however, that someone should be responsible for my medical expenses. I\u2019m in a lot of trouble at the moment physically. It\u2019s even affecting my ability to do my day job, which is my only income. So, I\u2019m in need of an operation on my left knee, my right elbow, my back. My teeth keep getting pulled because I couldn\u2019t brush them for five-and-a-half years. So, it\u2019s becoming a very expensive exercise to fix myself from the years of torture.\" Hicks had previously said he would have died in Guant\u00e1namo had he not pleaded guilty. Also Wednesday, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott refused to apologize to Hicks on behalf of the Australian government.\n\nReport: Police Detective Committed Abuses from Chicago to Guant\u00e1namo Bay A former Guant\u00e1namo Bay interrogator involved in torture was also a longtime Chicago police officer known for abusing people of color. According to The Guardian, Richard Zuley spent three decades as a notoriously brutal detective on the Chicago police force. From 1977 to 2007, Zuley used tactics including torture, threats and abuse to elicit confessions from suspects, the majority of whom were not white. One of those confessions was later ruled to be false, and the sentence was vacated. Zuley\u2019s methods included shackling suspects to walls through eyebolts for several hours, allegedly planting evidence, and issuing threats of harm to family members and sentences of the death penalty unless a suspect confessed. Zuley was also accused of brutal methods at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, where he was a reserve officer in charge of interrogating a prisoner who said he made a false confession due to torture.\n\nAdmin: 11.4 Million Obtain Insurance in New Obamacare Enrollment Period The White House says around 11.4 million people have signed up for health insurance during the second enrollment period of Obamacare. In a video posted by the White House, President Obama said his signature healthcare program is doing better than expected. President Obama: \"It gives you some sense of how hungry people were out there for affordable, accessible health insurance. And that\u2019s really the top-line message. The Affordable Care Act is working. It\u2019s working a little better than we anticipated\u2014certainly, I think, working a lot better than many of the critics talked about early on.\"\n\nReport: Justice Dept. Ready to Sue Ferguson Police over Racial Bias The Justice Department is reportedly prepared to sue the Ferguson, Missouri, police department if it does not address racial bias in its practices. According to CNN, outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder will announce the findings of a federal probe in the coming weeks, before he steps down. The Justice Department is expected to accuse the Ferguson police force of a history of systemic bias, backing the claims of a recent lawsuit that said local officials have targeted people of color with arrests, tickets and fines.\n\nHolder Backs National Moratorium on Death Penalty amid Lethal Injection Review Attorney General Eric Holder has announced he would support a national moratorium on the death penalty. Holder made the comments in light of a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to stay executions in Oklahoma pending a review of its lethal injections. Attorney General Eric Holder: \"Now I\u2019m speaking personally, not as a member of the administration, so somehow separate yourself here. You know, I think there are fundamental questions that we need to ask about the death penalty. I have not been shy in saying that I am a person who is opposed to the use of the death penalty. \u2026 The Supreme Court\u2019s determination as to whether or not lethal injection is consistent with our Constitution is one that ought to occur. From my perspective, I think a moratorium until the Supreme Court made that determination would be appropriate.\"\n\nRecord-Breaking Cold Engulfs Eastern U.S. Subzero temperatures have engulfed the eastern third of the United States today as a blast of Arctic air rolls in from Siberia. The cold is expected to shatter records in more than 100 places.\n\nReport: Clinton, Warren Held Private Meeting to Discuss Economic Agenda Hillary Rodham Clinton has held a private meeting with the senator many progressives hope will challenge her for the Democratic nomination, Elizabeth Warren. The New York Times reports Clinton invited Warren to her Washington, D.C., home in December to consult on building a populist economic agenda.

Warren has said she is not running for president, but progressive activists have launched a campaign urging her to reconsider.
