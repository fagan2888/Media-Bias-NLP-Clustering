A man died in a motorcycle accident on the westbound I-20 early Sunday morning, the Dallas County Sheriff’s Department said.

At around 12:49 a.m., a Volkswagen knocked a man off his motorcycle on the I-20 at U.S. Highway 175, said Raul Reyna, spokesman for the department. Another driver was traveling in the right lane and didn’t see the fallen motorcyclist in time before striking him, Reyna said.

The motorcyclist was killed after being hit by the second driver. Both drivers stopped after the impact, Reyna said.

The motorcyclist has been identified as James Jordan, 53.

No charges are pending at this time, Reyna added.
