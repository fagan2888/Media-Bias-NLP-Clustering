INDIANAPOLIS — Vernon Davis arrived at the Broncos’ training facility Tuesday elated to be on a Peyton Manning-led team — one that two days earlier defeated the Packers and one that also boasted the league’s top overall defense.

The excitement was tempered after his debut with his team, a 27-24 loss to the Colts.

Davis’ snaps were limited, as expected, after only three full days of practice with the Broncos. He was targeted only once and had zero receptions in the loss, while fellow tight end Owen Daniels caught six of nine targets for 102 yards and a game-tying, 1-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter.

But the loss, though hardly pleasant, had its value to Davis.

“I was just absorbing it all in, watching some of my teammates, Owen Daniels and Virgil (Green),” Davis said afterward. “Watching those guys and learning from them as I continue to move forward.”



Davis said he entered the game knowing “a bulk” of the Broncos’ playbook after less than a week with the team.

“There’s still more that I need to know, in order to get out there and be able play fast,” he said. “You know how it is when you’re thinking. You can’t play fast. You’re worried about this, you’re worried about that, your mind’s not free. So I just got to keep attacking it, keep getting better and better.”

Although Davis hopes to take what he observed and in apply it in future practices, future game days, he isn’t one to dwell. Moving on from the first loss of the season, he said, requires letting go.

“It happens,” he said. “You can’t dwell on the. You just have to move forward and get ready for the next one.”
