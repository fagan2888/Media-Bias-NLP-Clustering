But who polices the CCRB?\n\nWe raise this question in light of its much-cited but little-analyzed 155-page report suggesting New York is in the midst of a growing epidemic of police using banned chokeholds and NYPD brass are reluctant to crack down on them.\n\nIts release comes, of course, in the aftermath of Eric Garner\u2019s death after police on Staten Island tried to subdue him as he resisted arrest.\n\nUnfortunately, for all its statistical tables and pie charts, this report \u2014 which bills itself as a \u201can objective, comprehensive assessment\u201d \u2014 is woefully lacking in any context.\n\nOr, as Maria Haberfeld, a professor of police science at CUNY\u2019s John Jay College of Criminal Justice, told The Wall Street Journal: \u201cPeople think they understand how police work should be done.\n\nBut there\u2019s a tremendous discrepancy between how police work is done and how people\u201d \u2014 i.e., civilians \u2014 \u201cthink it should be done.\u201d\n\nFor all the allegations of improper chokeholds, only a small number were found to be substantiated.\n\nThe CCRB contends this is because the previous administration bent over backward to redefine the ban on chokeholds so as to limit punishment. The tone suggests a board that has enlisted with the New York Civil Liberties Union rather than one objectively seeking the truth.\n\nIndeed, some of the cases cited in report themselves raise questions about the complaints. In one case, a student insisted she had been in a chokehold for \u201ctwo or three minutes.\u201d\n\nBut video footage confirmed the girl\u2019s neck had been squeezed for \u201cfour or five seconds.\u201d In another, a complaint was substantiated based on the testimony of an \u201ceyewitness\u201d \u2014 someone who had himself been placed under arrest.\n\nLittle wonder Police Commissioner Bill Bratton has complained the CCRB has been \u201csignificantly overcharging and overpenalizing\u201d with overly harsh punishment requests.\n\nNor is it surprising that allegations are on the rise, given the current presumptions at City Hall against cops and the growing influence of longtime cop critics such as Al Sharpton.

Where punishment is called for, let them have it in full measure.\n\nBut keeping the city\u2019s streets safe is a thankless and difficult job.
