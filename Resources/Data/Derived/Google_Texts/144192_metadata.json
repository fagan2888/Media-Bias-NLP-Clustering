With the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage they will soon be able to do so. Before the ruling, the two were worried because they wanted to stay here in Meridian.\n\n\u201cWe were like, \u2018I don\u2019t know where can we drive to?\u2019 Where do we want to start a new life? What place is going to support our way of living?\u201d Stephen Thomas says.\n\nSome disagree with gay marriage because they say homosexuality is recognized as a sin in the Bible. They believe the church should never perform a same-sex marriage ceremony or accept a homosexual couple as members. But one pastor says his disagreement is not about hatred toward gay couples.\n\n\u201cI can still love you and disagree with your lifestyle. That carries itself through a lot of what the Bible would call sin,\u201d pastor Corey Fontan.\n\nThe leader of a local Episcopal Church says they will recognize a same-sex marriage ceremony as a blessing of a civil union without signing legal documents. He says there are so many things that are more important for us to worry about than who loves who - like poverty, hunger and crime.\n\n\u201cIf you want to take one thing out of the Bible and hold it up above everything else, you run the risk of ignoring that people are people and they deserve to be treated that way. It\u2019s easy to nitpick,\u201d Priest Joshua Messick says.\n\nFontan says, for his church, it comes down to this:\n\n\u201cHow can we still value and protect the dignity and the integrity of every individual human being born and created in the image of God but still maintain from a spiritual and religious perspective, what the gospel and scripture teach us about marriage, which is man and woman for life,\u201d Fontan says.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to look at what we believe in the Bible, we can take all of the Old Testament, or we can look at the last two commandments: love God, love your neighbor,\u201d Messick says.\n\nAs far as Stephen and Nykolas are concerned, they say people in Meridian have been very supportive of them.\n\nLuckily, we are in a community where a lot of people support us. We don\u2019t have to really deal with a lot of prejudice. We have a lot of people who love us,\u201d Thomas says.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "With the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage, the discussion has shifted to whether it is right or wrong.", "language": "english", "author": "Tom Williams", "og": {"description": "With the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage, the discussion has shifted to whether it is right or wrong.", "title": "Locals Discuss Views on Same-Sex Marriage", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Locals-Discuss-Views-on-Same-Sex-Marriage-310373421.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/5E9/45B/5E945B8CB4524FDF861FCF908B344ED3", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/22E/039/22E03904C9594320A6B04EBEE6168CF4.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "With the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage, the discussion has shifted to whether it is right or wrong.", "title": "Locals Discuss Views on Same-Sex Marriage", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Locals-Discuss-Views-on-Same-Sex-Marriage-310373421.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/marriage+license1.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Locals Discuss Views on Same-Sex Marriage", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Locals Discuss Views on SameSex"}, "article_summary": "With the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage they will soon be able to do so.\nSome disagree with gay marriage because they say homosexuality is recognized as a sin in the Bible.\nThey believe the church should never perform a same-sex marriage ceremony or accept a homosexual couple as members.\nWhat place is going to support our way of living?\u201d Stephen Thomas says.\nThe leader of a local Episcopal Church says they will recognize a same-sex marriage ceremony as a blessing of a civil union without signing legal documents."}
