Bob McDonnell likely heading off to prison, the nation must now ask: Is it time to indict President Obama?\n\nThe question arises because Obama has done much of what McDonnell did, and in some cases to a greater degree. Let\u2019s compare and contrast.\n\nMcDonnell: The heart of the case against McDonnell was this: He used the power of his office to help a benefactor, Jonnie Williams Sr., by promoting Williams\u2019 product\u2014Anatabloc\u2014and arranging meetings between Williams and state officials.\n\nAs many news services noted, prosecutors pressed McDonnell about one telling sequence of events in which he asked Williams about a $50,000 loan and then, six minutes later, emailed a staffer, \u201cPls see me about anatabloc issues at VCU and UVA. Thx.\u201d\n\nThat looks pretty bad. But then so does this:\n\nObama: In May of 2011, Washington lawyer Antoinette Bush met with Obama officials and a Hollywood lobbyist at the White House to discuss concerns raised by the entertainment industry. As reported several months later, Ms. Bush and her husband \u201chave donated heavily to the president\u2019s re-election effort: Mr. Bush gave $35,800 on the day of his wife\u2019s White House meeting last year.\u201d\n\nThat was from a New York Times story: \u201cWhite House Opens Door to Big Donors, and Lobbyists Slip In,\u201d which found a clear correlation between the size of a donation and the donor\u2019s access to the Obama White House. The story also noted that donor gifts were \u201csometimes given in close proximity to meetings.\u201d\n\nMcDonnell: One of the more damning witnesses for the prosecution was Bill Hazel, Virginia\u2019s Secretary of Health and Human Resources. Regarding Anatabloc, he declared on the witness stand that \u201cI won\u2019t even put the stuff in my mouth.\u201d Still, he met with Williams because the governor wanted him to. As The Times-Dispatch reported, Hazel got \u201ca request in a late-night email from McDonnell to send a representative to a meeting at the Executive Mansion with Williams and the first lady.\u201d The meeting was set for the day after the McDonnells came back from a stay at Williams\u2019 Smith Mountain Lake estate. Despite it, Williams failed to persuade state officials to include Anatabloc in the formulary of medicinals covered by the state employee health plan.\n\nThat sounds like another passage from the Times story:\n\nObama: \u201cDr. William C. Mohlenbrock, chairman of a health care data analysis firm . . . contributed the maximum allowable gift, $35,800, to the Obama Victory Fund. . . . Later in the year . . . he landed a meeting with a top White House aide involved in the health care overhaul, but failed to persuade Medicare officials to require more health data collection as part of the new regulations. Joe E. Kiani, who heads a medical device company, Masimo Corporation, stepped up his giving to Democrats last year as medical device makers campaigned unsuccessfully for the repeal of an excise tax imposed on the industry. Mr. Kiani had several meetings with White House officials last year. . . . In the midst of these gatherings, he donated $35,800 to the victory fund.\u201d\n\nMcDonnell: In 2011, Williams pressed for\u2014and got\u2014a launch party for Anatabloc at the Executive Mansion. McDonnell made an appearance at the event. As news stories noted, \u201cprosecutors say it is one of the prime examples of an \u2018official act\u2019 that the first couple performed for Williams.\u201d\n\nObama: Just two months before McDonnell was indicted, The Washington Post reported on a public visit the president made to DreamWorks animation. The company is headed by Jeffrey Katzenberg. As the Post reported, \u201cKatzenberg ranks among the president\u2019s most valuable political donors and fundraisers, jumping in early to raise money for his first White House bid and pulling in more than $500,000 in donations in both 2008 and 2012.\u201d The story quotes Bill Allison, editorial director of the nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation, who called the DreamWorks appearance \u201cpayback.\u201d\n\nAt this point Democratic partisans might raise a key distinction: Obama\u2019s benefactors all contributed to his campaign coffers, while Jonnie Williams gave money to the McDonnells personally. But as the McDonnell legal team noted back in January, \u201cfederal law makes clear that quid pro quos can just as easily come in the form of campaign donations as personal gifts.\u201d\n\nIndeed. Four years ago Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich was tried (and convicted) on corruption charges for trying to sell an appointment to Obama\u2019s vacant Senate seat. News stories reported that \u201cprosecutors said (Blagojevich) had sought personal gain\u2014campaign donations, especially\u2014in exchange for\u201d the appointment and other official acts. Campaign donations, especially.\n\nDuring the McDonnell trial, Williams explained why he let the governor use his private jet: \u201cIf you\u2019re a Virginia company, you want to make sure you have access to these people. He\u2019s a politician, I\u2019m a businessman.\u201d No doubt former Rhode Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy would agree. Explaining why he gave $35,800 to Obama\u2019s re-election bid at the same time he was trying to get the administration to help his nonprofit, Kennedy told The New York Times that\u2019s just \u201chow this business works. If you want to call it quid pro quo, fine.\u201d\n\nAny thoughts on that, Eric Holder?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/09/10/is-it-time-to-indict-barack-obama", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "The president's misdeeds look suspiciously like those of former Virginia Gov.
