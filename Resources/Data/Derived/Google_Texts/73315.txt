Another federal judge has stopped another ObamaCare mandate case – at least temporarily – that involves a Christian organization.

Chuck Swindoll, currently chancellor of Dallas Theological Seminary and senior pastor at Stonebriar Community Church, filed suit against ObamaCare.

Liberty Institute senior counsel Justin Butterfield says Swindoll's ministry, Insight for Living, is objecting to providing insurance coverage to its employees for four categories of abortion-inducing drugs.

A federal judge this week issued an injunction barring the government from forcing the ministry to violate its religious beliefs. That will be in place until the court rules.

Butterfield says: "The Constitution and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, with all of these laws and constitutional principles, and the fact that since the Supreme Court decided Hobby Lobby, no religious organization has been forced to provide these drugs when they've challenged it in court."

After the Hobby Lobby ruling, says Butterfield, you would think the federal government would stop trying to force its will on ministries.

"But, no, the administration has decided to fight these cases," he adds.

So far over 100 lawsuits by non-profit groups and businesses have been filed against the ObamaCare mandate for free insurance coverage of contraceptives and abortion-causing drugs.
