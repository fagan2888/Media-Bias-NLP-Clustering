Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R) is telling the story behind his much-talked-about eyewear, saying his wife, Anita, selected the frames and that he’s “pretty comfortable” with the thick, black-rimmed specs.

Perry opened up to The Atlantic’s Michelle Cottle about his eyewear in a story published Tuesday , saying, “From time to time, someone says, ‘You need to get rid of the glasses.’

“And there’s a certain amount of people out there who say, ‘He got the glasses to change his appearance.’ I don’t know whether it changed my appearance or not, but I’m pretty comfortable. I like being able to see,” Perry explains.

The 2012 GOP presidential candidate got the glasses about a year ago, and says they’re a must-have after a decades-old eye injury came back to haunt him.

Perry, 64, says he “lost complete vision” in his left eye in 1967 after being hit “with a rock thrown across a football field by my best friend.” The governor says although he didn’t have access to an ophthalmologist after the injury, “my eye miraculously was healed” and he went on to fly planes in the Air Force.

After the 2012 White House race, Perry says a specialist diagnosed him with “pre-retinal fibrosis,” which he describes as an abnormally shaped retina. The Lone Star state politician was given a choice of surgery or glasses. His doctor advised him he’d be “more comfortable” going the glasses route.

“So anyway, there's the story of how it came for me to make the decision to wear glasses,” he says.
