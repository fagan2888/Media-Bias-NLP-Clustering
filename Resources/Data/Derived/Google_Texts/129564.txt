Some Traditional Hospital Systems Shifting Toward Mixed-Use 'Mini-Districts' as Part of Expansion Strategy Ahead of Expected Boom In New Patients

The University of Maryland Medical System has joined with Retail Properties of America Inc. to explore a mixed-use hospital project that would inject a combined $3.5 billion into the state's economy and support 26,587 jobs.

Nearly $100 billion in construction of new and expanded hospital medical office projects, both on and off the hospital campus, is under way across the U.S. In the current building boom, developers are as likely to be adding apartments, retail space and even hotels as more patient care facilities.At least five of the current major hospital expansion projects are valued at $1 billion or more, including an 800,000-square-foot, $2 billion expansion of Tisch Hospital in New York City at the NYU Langone Medical Center, the $1.5 billion, 700-bed University of Pennsylvania Hospital, and numerous new facilities adding luxury-style amenities to the $1.1 billion Johns Hopkins in Baltimore unveiled in 2012, which replaced the East Baltimore facility built in the 1930s through the 1950s with a hotel-like 1.6 million-square-foot tower and 560 private rooms, 33 operating rooms, new emergency rooms, gardens, food options and other amenities.With reduced reimbursements for hospital stays from the Center for Medicare/Medicaid (CMS) under Obamacare era, health-care systems are focused on building more profitable outpatient facilities near medical center campuses in convenient locations for patients, according to Jeffrey Cooper, executive managing director and group head of Savills Studley's Healthcare Capital Markets Group.In addition, health-care REITs such as Welltower Inc., formerly Health Care REIT, are allocating more capital to real estate as hospital systems consolidate due to mergers among the large insurance companies such as the recent acquisition of Humana Inc. by Aetna Inc."The retail strategy for these health care systems on mixed-use facilities is a result of their realization that they need to go where the patients live, work and shop in order to compete effectively with other hospital systems," said Savills Studley's Cooper. "And for hotels, apartments and retail, it makes a lot of business sense to have a synergistic affiliation with big medical centers. For example, there's a real demand for hotels close to hospitals, to house families visiting patients, and for multifamily to provide housing for health care employees who want to live nearby."In Austin's fledgling health care district, the University of Texas this month topped out the $300 million construction of Dell Seton Medical Center, the university's first teaching hospital. Late last month, Central Health held open houses to showcase preliminary plans for an addional health-care centered public market and community center, to be built on the site of the old hospital. Under the redevelopment plan, most of the old UMC Brackenridge Hospital will be razed to construction a mixed-use 14-acre office, retail, residential and hotel project, among other components.An even larger example, and one of the pioneers of the health care district model, is Lake Nona Medical City near Orlando, where master developer Tavistock Group is building a 650-acre health and life sciences center near Orlando International Airport.Bahamas-based investment group Tavistock in 2005 contributed 50 acres of its large land tract within the Lake Nona master plan to the University of Central Florida for construction of its medical school, mainly to add value to Tavistock's multifamily developments.Lake Nona is now home to UCF's Health Sciences Campus, which includes the university's College of Medicine and Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences, and the campus is planning to house its College of Nursing and College of Dental Medicine, as well as a teaching hospital.The medical city also includes the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, Nemours Children’s Hospital, a University of Florida Academic and Research Center, and Valencia College at Lake Nona. In addition, a Veterans Affairs Medical Center began seeing clinical patients in February of this year."Its a successful and exciting public/private partnership on a massive scale, with housing built all around it in order to make the money," Cooper said.Other large hospital projects are in the development pipeline, topped by a $1 billion expansion of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and fundraising arm ALSAC in Memphis, which could increase its total workforce by 2,000 employees over the next several years.St. Jude's six-year strategic plan calls for a total $9 billion investment to double the number of children in clinical trials and create a global research consortium of institutions researching cure for rare and aggressive diseases. The St. Jude program includes construction of a new patient and family housing facility and patient experience centers on the 66-acre campus.In Prince George’s County, the University of Maryland Medical Systems has teamed with mall owner and developer Retail Properties of America Inc. to study a proposed $650 million, 700,000-square-foot teaching hospital developed by Dimensions Healthcare System and UMMS to replace the 75-year-old Prince George's Hospital Center.The hospital construction is viewed as part of the redevelopment of the Largo Town Center Metro Station area with up to three million square feet of commercial space, including one million square feet of retail, a 650-room hotel, nursing facility and more than 4,000 residential units. Once complete in 2019 or 2020, the projects will support a combined $3.5 billion in economic activity and support 26,587 jobs, according to a report by the county.In other cases, the hospital is merging with existing malls and shopping centers. For example, 100 Oaks Mall, a failing 1 million-square-foot mall near downtown Nashville, made a deal with Vanderbilt University Medical Center to take over the second floor of the mall, which it's using to house outpatient clinic and administrative offices. The move helped relieve pressure on the crowded Vanderbilt campus, and the 2,500 daily employees and patients helped the ground-floor retail stores recover.
