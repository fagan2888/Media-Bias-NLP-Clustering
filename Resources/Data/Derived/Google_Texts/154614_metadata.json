Such screening will include checks for blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein, commonly referred to as HDL, and total cholesterol, nonfasting glucose levels, body mass index and waist circumference. Blood will also be screened to determine whether the employee or spouse smokes tobacco.\n\nThe EEOC initially sought a temporary restraining order to keep Honeywell from imposing any penalty or cost upon an employee under the program. Judge Ann Montgomery denied the EEOC\u2019s request, finding that Honeywell could refund any improper penalties if she ultimately ruled in the EEOC\u2019s favor. The lawsuit will proceed without the restraining order.\n\nEmployees will be penalized (or lose incentives) if they or their spouses do not take the biometric tests, as follows:\n\nA $500 surcharge applied to the employee\u2019s premium cost for the medical plan.\n\nLoss of health savings account contributions from Honeywell of up to $1,500.\n\nA $1,000 tobacco surcharge even if the employee does not participate in biometric testing for reasons other than smoking.\n\nAnother $1,000 tobacco surcharge if the employee\u2019s spouse does not take part in the testing, even if the spouse does not participate for reasons other than smoking.\n\nHoneywell claims that its wellness incentives are permissible because they fall within the guidelines established under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act as amended by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nUnder HIPAA, the total financial reward that may be given to an individual for participating in a wellness programs is limited. Beginning in 2014 the total reward cannot exceed 30 percent of the total premium cost of the employee\u2019s coverage under the employer\u2019s medical plan. The total reward can be increased to a total of 50 percent of such premium cost for a program that includes a tobacco cessation program.\n\nThe limits on awards apply only to programs (or portions of programs) that require outcomes based on a health factor, such as being tobacco free for a certain period of time or maintaining a certain BMI. There is no limit for programs that merely require participation in a program without regard to the outcome, such as incentives to undergo a biometric test without regard to the results of such test.\n\nRegardless, the EEOC claims that Honeywell\u2019s incentives violate the ADA. Under the ADA, an employer may require employees to undergo medical examinations or respond to disability-related inquiries only if they are \u201cjob-related and consistent with business necessity.\u201d There are two possible exceptions: the \u201cvoluntary\u201d exception and the \u201csafe harbor\u201d exception.\n\nUnder the voluntary exception, a program does not violate the ADA if participation by the employee is voluntary. Under the \u201csafe harbor\u201d exception, the rules regarding medical examinations and disability-related inquiries do not prohibit an employer from establishing, sponsoring, observing, or administering the terms of a bona fide benefit plan that are based on underwriting, classifying or administering risks.\n\nThe EEOC\u2019s lawsuit claims that the Honeywell program does not comply because employees are penalized for not participating in medical examinations that are not job-related or consistent with business necessity. Although recognizing that there is an exception for \u201cvoluntary\u201d medical examinations, the EEOC claims that these exams are not voluntary because of the financial penalties.\n\nThe EEOC does not specify whether lesser financial incentives would be permissible. However, an EEOC attorney stated: \u201cemployers have to respect employees\u2019 and their spouses\u2019 rights to the privacy of their medical information, and cannot seek to compel it by imposing prohibitively high penalties.\u201d The EEOC\u2019s lawsuit does not address the application of the \u201csafe-harbor\u201d exception.\n\nThe EEOC also claims that Honeywell\u2019s wellness program violates GINA because employees are penalized if their spouses do not complete the biometric testing. According to the EEOC, \u201cHoneywell is offering an inducement within the meaning of GINA to obtain medical information of its employees\u2019 spouses\u201d and \u201cmedical information relating to manifested conditions of spouses is family medical history \u2014 or genetic information \u2014 under GINA.\u201d\n\nThe EEOC\u2019s lawsuit is the third time in 2014 that the agency has challenged an employer\u2019s wellness program. This challenge is noteworthy in that it involves a program that does not shift the entire premium cost to the employee, cancel coverage or subject an employee to other disciplinary action. Honeywell\u2019s program was seemingly designed to fall squarely within the HIPAA guidelines.\n\nEmployers have been seeking guidance from the EEOC for years regarding its position on when a wellness program will be considered \u201cvoluntary\u201d for purposes of the ADA. However, the EEOC has not provided guidance or indicated an intention to do so. With this lawsuit, the EEOC has demonstrated that the ADA should not be overlooked by employers when structuring these programs.\n\nSandra R.
