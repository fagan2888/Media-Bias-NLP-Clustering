MANCHESTER, Maine (AP) - Officials say a Maine couple found dead in a parked SUV on Christmas morning had been shot, and authorities are now investigating the case as a double homicide.

Detectives are trying to retrace the events of Christmas Eve to figure out what happened to 35-year-old Eric Williams and 26-year-old Bonnie Royer, who lived together in Augusta, less than a mile from where they were found in Manchester.

Authorities say autopsies performed Saturday confirmed that both died of gunshot wounds.

One of the victims - police havenâ€™t said who - called 911 at around 3:30 a.m. Friday from an isolated dirt road. Officers who responded found both of them dead.

Somerset County police dispatch logs show a complaint was made at 3:34 a.m. about shots fired in the same location, the Kennebec Journal reported.
