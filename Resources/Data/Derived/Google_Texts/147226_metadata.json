(AP) - A former employee of a Mississippi hospital is getting almost $3.5 million as part of a string of settlements where 18 hospitals in seven states have agreed to pay $20.4 million over allegations they broke federal law by receiving Medicare reimbursements for psychiatric services that were not \u201cmedically reasonable or necessary.\u201d\n\nRyan Ladner worked for Allegiance Health Management at what\u2019s now Merit Health Wesley in Hattiesburg when his lawyer says Ladner saw illegal billing.\n\nAs the person who brought the fraud to the attention of the federal government, Ladner is getting 17 percent of the settlement amounts. None of the hospitals admit liability in their settlements. However, LifePoint Hospitals self-reported the practices to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 2011.\n\nSettlement documents indicate Ladner has been pursuing a whistleblower lawsuit in federal court in Arkansas since 2010 against Allegiance, which is based in Shreveport, La. The case remains under seal, though. Whistleblower actions under the False Claims Act are filed under seal with the private plaintiff seeking to recover money on behalf of the federal government.\n\nThe plaintiff, called a relator, sends the lawsuit and a statement to federal authorities, who must decide whether to intervene or not. Cases can remain sealed for years while the government investigates, if a judge agrees. It\u2019s unclear if the government intends to intervene against Allegiance. Lawyers for Ladner and Allegiance declined to confirm that the suit exists.\n\nAllegiance denies wrongdoing and still operates outpatient therapy programs at 17 locations in five states, according to its website.\n\n\u201cAllegiance remains confident that the outpatient psychiatric services provided in the IOPs managed or operated by Allegiance were medically necessary and appropriate as has been confirmed by various government contractors and agencies on multiple occasions through audits, surveys and other inquiries,\u201d the company\u2019s lawyer, Michael Schulze, wrote in a statement.\n\nCliff Johnson, Ladner\u2019s lawyer, said Ladner was hired by Allegiance to serve as program director for its Inspirations outpatient psychotherapy service at what was then called Wesley Medical Center in Hattiesburg. Ladner got the job even though his previous background was in mortgage lending, Johnson said.\n\n\u201cMy client is a smart man who takes seriously the responsibilities he\u2019s given,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAs responsible people do, he attempted to educate himself about the legal requirements for billing services provided at Inspirations and the type of patients who qualify for such services.\u201d\n\nThe settlements indicate Allegiance would perform the therapy, the hospitals would bill for it, and Allegiance would get either a share of what they collected or a flat fee. The federal government contends the therapy wasn\u2019t eligible for federal reimbursement for one of several reasons - the patient\u2019s condition didn\u2019t qualify, the treatments weren\u2019t provided according to an individual treatment plan, patient progress wasn\u2019t adequately tracked, or the therapy was \u201cprimarily recreational or diversional in nature, and was not therapeutic.\n\nThe Justice Department said hospitals knowingly submitted improper bills as early as 2005 and continuing into 2013.\n\n\u201cHospitals that participate in the Medicare program must ensure that the services they provide and bill for are based on the medical needs of patients rather than the desire to maximize profits,\u201d said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Benjamin C. Mizer of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division said in announcing the settlements earlier this month.\n\nCommunity Health Systems of Franklin, Tennessee, is paying $15.2 million for 15 hospitals, one in Hattiesburg and others that formerly belonged to Health Management Associates, which Community took over.\n\nSince January 2009, the Justice Department has recovered $15.3 billion in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs.\n\n___\n\nFollow Jeff Amy at http://twitter.com/jeffamy", "article_metadata": {"description": "A former employee of a Mississippi hospital is getting almost $3.5 million as part of a string of settlements where 18 hospitals in seven states have agreed to pay $20.4 million over allegations they broke federal law by receiving Medicare reimbursements for psychiatric services that were not \"medically reasonable or necessary.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/23/mississippi-hospital-whistleblower-gets-35m-in-set/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A former employee of a Mississippi hospital is getting almost $3.5 million as part of a string of settlements where 18 hospitals in seven states have agreed to pay $20.4 million over allegations they broke federal law by receiving Medicare reimbursements for psychiatric services that were not \u201cmedically reasonable or necessary.\u201d", "title": "Mississippi hospital whistleblower gets $3.5M in settlement"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "A former employee of a Mississippi hospital is getting almost $3.5 million as part of a string of settlements where 18 hospitals in seven states have agreed to pay $20.4 million over allegations they", "card": "summary", "title": "Mississippi hospital whistleblower gets $3.5M in settlement"}, "Author": "JEFF AMY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Since January 2009, the Justice Department has recovered $15.3 billion in cases involving fraud against federal health care programs.\nAs the person who brought the fraud to the attention of the federal government, Ladner is getting 17 percent of the settlement amounts.\nSettlement documents indicate Ladner has been pursuing a whistleblower lawsuit in federal court in Arkansas since 2010 against Allegiance, which is based in Shreveport, La.\nHowever, LifePoint Hospitals self-reported the practices to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 2011.\nWhistleblower actions under the False Claims Act are filed under seal with the private plaintiff seeking to recover money on behalf of the federal government."}
