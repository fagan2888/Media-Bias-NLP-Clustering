The commission staff determined there were 1,614 wells in the flood zone.\n\n\u201cMany oil and gas facilities located near flooded streams were damaged,\u201d the report said. \u201cOil, condensate and produced water spilled into the environment.\u201d\n\nAbout 48,250 gallons of oil and condensate spilled, and more than 43,478 gallons of produced water were released, according to the report.\n\nThe Colorado Oil & Gas Association, a trade group, issued a statement immediately after the report was released.\n\n\u201cCOGA does not believe any legislative or statutory changes are necessary,\u201d association president Tisha Schuller said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work with the commission to share lessons learned and continually improve best management practices,\u201d Schuller said.\n\nThe oil and gas commission, a regulatory panel appointed by the governor, is slated to take up the report\u2019s recommendations at its April meeting.\n\n\u201cThis report is a first step,\u201d said Alan Gilbert, the state Department of Natural Resources\u2019 flood response coordinator. \u201cWe need to figure out what if anything the state should do and what the industry should do,\u201d Gilbert said.\n\nThe oil and gas commission has identified 20,850 wells within 500 feet of rivers, streams and drainages, including 5,900 near significant waterways.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned by the number of wells so close to our surface waters,\u201d said Laura Belanger, a water resource engineer with the environmental group Western Resource Advocates.\n\n\u201cEven without floods, there are a lot of spills,\u201d she said.\n\nThe report noted problem areas such as flowing water eroding earthen berms and foundations below tanks and equipment.\n\n\u201cEarly on, there were widespread fears that public safety was threatened by damaged oil and gas equipment\u201d during the floods, the report said. \u201cThose fears later proved to be unfounded, but they attracted nationwide attention.\u201d\n\nAmong the recommended requirements for wells and operations near waterways are:\n\n\u2022 Inventories of wells and equipment.\n\n\u2022 Automatic shut-in valves for wells within a designated distance of the normal high-water mark. These were very effective during the September flood.\n\n\u2022 No pits allowed within a designated distance of the high water mark.\n\n\u2022 Secondary containment constructed of steel berms and synthetic liners around wells and tanks. No earthen berms.\n\n\u2022 Tanks and equipment must be secured to the ground with anchors and cables.\n\n\u2022 Structural fencing must be located upstream to protect the well site.\n\n\u2022 Tanks and production equipment should be located as far from waterways as possible.\n\nThe report also recommended that the oil and gas commission upgrade its emergency management procedures.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t go far enough,\u201d said Bill Dvorak, a public lands organizer for the National Wildlife Federation. \u201cWe really need riparian setbacks to keep oil and gas operations away from streams.\u201d\n\nAt their April meeting, the oil and gas commissioners will decide which recommendations they want to pursue, the Department of Natural Resources\u2019 Gilbert said.\n\nMark Jaffe: 303-954-1912, mjaffe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/bymarkjaffe", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tighter controls needed for oil and gas wells near Colorado waterways", "title": "Tighter controls needed for oil and gas wells near Colorado waterways", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/17/tighter-controls-needed-for-oil-and-gas-wells-near-colorado-waterways/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140223_111642_CD07PCOGASBILLS_RJ12516-2.jpg", "height": 487}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140223_111642_CD07PCOGASBILLS_RJ12516-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-17T12:13:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T19:52:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Drilling, Fracking"}, "article_summary": "Among the requirements would be more information on operations near waterways and better construction and safety equipment.\n\u201cThose fears later proved to be unfounded, but they attracted nationwide attention.\u201dAmong the recommended requirements for wells and operations near waterways are:\u2022 Inventories of wells and equipment.\nThe oil and gas commission has identified 20,850 wells within 500 feet of rivers, streams and drainages, including 5,900 near significant waterways.\nThe Colorado Oil & Gas Association, a trade group, issued a statement immediately after the report was released.\nThe oil and gas commission, a regulatory panel appointed by the governor, is slated to take up the report\u2019s recommendations at its April meeting."}
