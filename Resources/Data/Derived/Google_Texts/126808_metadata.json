He saw in the nation\u2019s founding documents the unchanging foundation of an endlessly dynamic society. He embraced the market and the amazing transportation and communications revolutions beginning to take hold.\n\nAt the end of his enjoyable book, Mr. Lowry takes what he understands to be Lincoln\u2019s philosophical dispositions and policy perspectives and suggests how they might be applied to address today\u2019s problems. This is an interesting, thought-provoking exercise, but you\u2019ll have to get the book to see whether or not you agree.\n\nFor today, I just want to comment on how Lincoln\u2019s thoughts concerning what he called \u201cfree labor\u201d relate closely \u2013 indeed, are integral \u2013 to a proper understanding of our free enterprise system and property rights and to what the Declaration of Independence refers to as the \u201cunalienable Rights\u201d to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. While Lincoln could not have anticipated Labor Day as it has evolved today, I want to suggest that his own understanding of \u201clabor\u201d ought to have a special resonance as we think about the meaning of this Labor Day.\n\nAs Lincoln\u2019s thinking evolved, and especially by the time of the Lincoln \u2013 Douglas debates, Lincoln increasingly based his argument against the abomination of slavery on his understanding of the meaning of the natural rights secured, in his view, by the Declaration of Independence. But long before rising to national prominence for his stand against human bondage, Lincoln had espoused, over and over again, his belief that an individual should reap the reward of his own labor.\n\nAs Mr. Lowry points out, in 1847 Lincoln wrote that \u201ceach individual is naturally entitled to do as he pleases with himself and the fruit of his labor.\u201d Or, as he put it in a more colloquial Lincolnism: \u201cI always thought the man that made the corn should eat the corn.\u201d\n\nLincoln\u2019s views concerning free labor \u2013 and the Declaration\u2019s affirmation of the natural right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness \u2013 were grounded in the Founders\u2019 understanding and acceptance of John Locke\u2019s work, with which they were intimately familiar and often relied upon. In his famous Second Treatise of Government, Locke put it this way:\n\n[E]very man has a property in his own person: this no body has any right to but himself. The labour of his body, and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property.\n\nNote the explicit way that Locke linked an individual\u2019s own labor to his property interest.\n\nFollowing Locke, James Madison, the principal drafter of our Constitution, declared that individuals possess property rights \u201cin their actual possessions, in the labor that acquires their daily subsistence, and in the hallowed remnant of time which ought to relieve their Fatigues and soothe their cares.\u201d\n\nIn his opposition to slavery, but also in a more universal sense, Lincoln repeatedly articulated the Lockean view that all individuals, of whatever race or creed, possess a natural right to enjoy the fruits of their own labor, to make those fruits their own property.\n\nMoreover, Lincoln understood that the intertwining of free labor and property rights was essential to securing and maintaining the liberty espoused by the Declaration of Independence and guaranteed by the Constitution \u2013 and that free labor, individual initiative, and property rights are essential elements of the American free enterprise system.\n\nFinally, in extolling the virtue of labor and property, Lincoln frequently admonished those who would set one man or class against another. As he put it in 1864 in his reply to the New York Workingmen\u2019s Democratic Republican Association:\n\nProperty is the fruit of labor\u2026property is desirable\u2026is a positive good in the world. That some should be rich shows that others may become rich, and hence is just encouragement to industry and enterprise. Let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another; but let him labor diligently and build one for himself\u2026.\n\nAs early as 1847 Lincoln had expressed the same thought this way:\n\n[I]t has so happened in all ages of the world, that some have laboured, and others have without labour, enjoyed a large proportion of the fruits. This is wrong and should not continue. To [secure] each labourer the whole product of his labour, or as nearly as possible, is a most worthy object of any good government.\n\nTo my mind, it is always timely to consider Lincoln. And as Labor Day approaches, it is especially timely \u2013 and useful \u2013 to consider Lincoln\u2019s views on free labor, and to contemplate the inextricably intertwined nature of labor, property rights, individual freedom, and the American free enterprise system which Lincoln championed.\n\nWhether you are working this Labor Day, or merely contemplating Lincoln\u2019s thoughts on labor, my best wishes for an enjoyable Labor Day weekend.\n\n[First published at the Free State Foundation blog.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2013/09/labor-day-2013-lincoln-labor-and-liberty/", "type": "activity", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/abraham-lincoln.jpg", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "title": "Labor Day 2013: Lincoln, Labor, and Liberty"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Whether you are working this Labor Day, or merely contemplating Lincoln\u2019s thoughts on labor, my best wishes for an enjoyable Labor Day weekend.\nAnd as Labor Day approaches, it is especially timely \u2013 and useful \u2013 to consider Lincoln\u2019s views on free labor, and to contemplate the inextricably intertwined nature of labor, property rights, individual freedom, and the American free enterprise system which Lincoln championed.\nFinally, in extolling the virtue of labor and property, Lincoln frequently admonished those who would set one man or class against another.\nWhile Lincoln could not have anticipated Labor Day as it has evolved today, I want to suggest that his own understanding of \u201clabor\u201d ought to have a special resonance as we think about the meaning of this Labor Day.\nMoreover, Lincoln understood that the intertwining of free labor and property rights was essential to securing and maintaining the liberty espoused by the Declaration of Independence and guaranteed by the Constitution \u2013 and that free labor, individual initiative, and property rights are essential elements of the American free enterprise system."}
