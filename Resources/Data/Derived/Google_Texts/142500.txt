Just when you think there's nothing Miley Cyrus could do to surprise you, she goes and does something like this. On Saturday, Sept. 7, the former child star took the stage on the German TV show Schlag den Raab to perform her hit "We Can't Stop." Instead of twerking with giant teddy bears, however, she rocked out with a band made up entirely of little people.

Backed by five little musicians -- each on their own pedestal -- the 20-year-old Hannah Montana alum sashayed provocatively around the floor in thigh-high boots, super-short cutoffs, and a black bra top under a bedazzled jacket. At one point during the song, she was joined onstage by a spandex-wearing little dancer, whose butt she playfully slapped.

The unusual performance comes just two weeks after another headline-making moment across the Atlantic: Cyrus' controversial duet with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. Speaking about the much talked-about "Blurred Lines" collaboration in an interview with MTV three days after the event, the twerk-loving pop star bragged that she had made "history."

"Every VMA performance, that's what you're looking for; you're wanting to make history," she explained. "Me and Robin the whole time said, 'You know we're about to make history right now.'"

And as for her haters? "I don't pay attention to the negative because I've seen this play out so many times," she said. "How many times have we seen this play out in pop music?"
