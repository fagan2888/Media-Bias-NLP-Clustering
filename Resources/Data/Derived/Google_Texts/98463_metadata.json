Read all the entries in the series here.\n\n\n\nIlustration by Robert Neubecker\n\nWhen I got pregnant with my daughter, I had been living in France for only about six months, and hadn\u2019t yet received my Carte Vitale, France\u2019s universal health care card. The day I went for my first sonogram, my midwife warned me that I should brace myself for a big bill. \u201cSince you don\u2019t have your Carte Vitale yet,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s going to be costly.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m an American, and accustomed to American medical costs\u2014I\u2019d always worked for small businesses, where company insurance usually came with high co-pays and out-of-network deductibles. So of course I tensed up. \u201cHow much will it be?\u201d I asked the midwife fearfully. \u201cWill it be\u2014more than 1,000 euros?\u201d (That\u2019s about $1,300 at today\u2019s exchange rate.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nShe looked at me like I was crazy. \u201cNo, it won\u2019t be that much!\u201d she exclaimed.\n\nThe final bill for the appointment was 150 euros, or about $200, which I paid in full, and for which I was later reimbursed in full.\n\nIn other words, \u201c$200 minus $200\u201d counts as a \u201ccostly\u201d medical bill in France.\n\nFrance is a proud welfare state, where public spending accounts for 53 percent of GDP\u2014the second-highest percentage in the developed world (only Sweden\u2019s is higher). The U.S. is the third-lowest, at 36 percent (ahead of Ireland and South Korea). Having a baby so soon after moving to France gave my husband and me a crash course in one of the largest components of the French welfare state: its medical system, which has often been called the best in the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFrance\u2019s health care system is a public/private hybrid: Everyone is covered to a certain extent by the government\u2019s Assurance Maladie, but most people also have private insurance, called a mutuelle, that is either offered through their employer or bought on the private market. There\u2019s a thriving private insurance market in France\u2014one that the Affordable Care Act can only dream of. Private medical insurance is advertised on the sides of buses and alongside movie previews in theaters, and there are plans geared toward numerous niches: college students, freelance professionals, and people who work in restaurants, to name a few.\n\nBecause my husband worked at a French company, he immediately began paying into the system, which covered me as well while I wasn\u2019t working. In addition, my husband\u2019s employers provided a choice of mutuelle; the top-of-the-line plan, which we signed up for, cost about 50 euros ($68) a month. By contrast, in the U.S., I\u2019d been paying about $350 a month with an additional $50 co-pay for each doctor\u2019s appointment.\n\nI was adjusting to the outlandish notion that I would know the exact cost of my health care services before buying them.\n\nOur first task was to find a place to have the baby. I\u2019d suspected I was pregnant for two weeks before I took a pregnancy test, not wanting to be overly anxious. This was my first mistake. \u201cYou must call the maternit\u00e9s now\u2014vite! Vite!\u201d my friend Anais practically yelled at me when she heard. And she was right: Six weeks pregnant, I was already too late to get a spot in many of Paris\u2019 public maternity wards. Only then did I learn that most Parisian women call the hospital the day they miss their period. I have a friend who walked to her local hospital with her pregnancy test in hand the minute she found out.\n\nThis kind of crowding, especially in bigger cities, is one of the downsides of a government-run health care system. On the upside, had I managed to book a bed in one of the public wards, my birth would have been completely free, paid for entirely by the government\u2019s Assurance Maladie. Everyone pays into Assurance Maladie through charges that are taken directly from their paycheck. (Unlike Americans, French employers and workers quote salaries as net, not gross\u2014so your salary is what you receive after deductions for health care and other social services.) From the sixth month of pregnancy to 11 days after a child\u2019s birth, the government covers a woman\u2019s medical expenses in full.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn full\u2014except for the costs of a private clinic if you\u2019ve missed out on a public ward. There are plenty of private maternit\u00e9s in Paris, and I found a great one, with an English-speaking midwife who agreed to follow my pregnancy from the outset, as I still had no regular doctor. But how expensive would it be?\n\nLuckily, transparency in the price of medical care is a legal requirement in France. The government sets what they consider fair prices for all appointments and procedures, and then reimburses these for everyone at 70 percent. This is not unlike Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S., but because the French government system covers the entire population, it has more bargaining power to keep prices low. For example, a private appointment with a midwife is calculated at a base cost of 28 euros\u2014the same price it would be at a public clinic or hospital. The government will reimburse the patient 18.50 euros of this, even if the midwife charges more; the rest the patient pays out of pocket and/or has covered by a mutuelle.\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon in the bigger cities, particularly in Paris, for a doctor to charge more than the government\u2019s recommended price. But these overages, called d\u00e9passements, don\u2019t come anywhere near what an American specialist might charge. In fact, under French law, a doctor must issue a receipt explaining any d\u00e9passement above 70 euros before beginning the test or appointment. (France is also arguably more creative than U.S. health care providers in keeping childbirth costs down. For example, women who are likely to have complication-free births are usually referred to a Level 1 maternity ward, which has an operating room in case a C-section is necessary but no neo-natal unit or full hospital facility attached to the clinic. In the U.S., most women deliver at a full-service hospital, even if it\u2019s likely they will experience no complications.)\n\nNot only was I getting accustomed to a radically different idea of what constitutes \u201cexpensive,\u201d but I was also adjusting to the outlandish notion that I would know the exact cost of my health care services before buying them.\n\nIn the U.S., meanwhile, it\u2019s often impossible to get a price for a delivery out of a hospital. Estimates vary by orders of magnitude: This California study of 100,000 complication-free deliveries showed that new mothers were charged anywhere from $3,296 to $37,227, with no clear medical reason for the massive discrepancy.\n\nBy contrast, for my complication-free delivery and five-day stay in a private clinic, my total out-of-pocket cost was 400 euros, or about $542.\n\nLast fall, I watched the rollout of the Affordable Care Act with great interest from across the Atlantic. I\u2019m self-employed, and I\u2019m just not sure how my husband and I would have been able to pay our medical bills under the old system if we\u2019d stayed in the U.S. The ACA is an improvement, but I don\u2019t think we should count Obamacare\u2019s average monthly premium of $328 as a success. That\u2019s still a lot of money for a middle-class family\u2014and that\u2019s before co-pays, in-network deductibles, and all manner of hidden costs. From my French-ified perspective, a single-payer system\u2014with strong government oversight to keep the price of medical care low\u2014seems like the only way to go.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "Having a baby in Paris gave me a crash course in socialized medicine\u2014and a new, very French definition of \u201ccostly.\u201d", "fb-share": "In France, a \u201cCostly\u201d Doctor\u2019s Appointment Is Actually Free", "sailthru.author": "Claire Lundberg", "description": "In this series, an American in Paris pits the French welfare state against the U.S. market economy\u00a0in five key categories: childbirth and health care,  ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "In this series, an American in Paris pits the French welfare state against the U.S. market economy\u00a0in five key categories: childbirth and health care,  ...", "title": "In France, a \u201cCostly\u201d Doctor\u2019s Appointment Is Actually Free", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/business/dispatches_from_the_welfare_state/2014/01/french_socialized_medicine_vs_u_s_health_care_having_a_baby_in_paris_is.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/business/moneybox/2014/01/140122_$BOX_Dispatches-Childbirth.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In this series, an American in Paris pits the French welfare state against the U.S. market economy\u00a0in five key categories: childbirth and health care,  ...", "title": "In France, a \u201cCostly\u201d Doctor\u2019s Appointment Is Actually Free", "url": "http://www.slate.com/articles/business/dispatches_from_the_welfare_state/2014/01/french_socialized_medicine_vs_u_s_health_care_having_a_baby_in_paris_is.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/business/moneybox/2014/01/140122_$BOX_Dispatches-Childbirth.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-01-27T23:52:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "In France, a \u201cCostly\u201d Doctor\u2019s Appointment Is Actually Free", "sailthru.headline": "$200 Minus $200", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"In France, a \\u201cCostly\\u201d Doctor\\u2019s Appointment Is Actually Free\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/articles/business/dispatches_from_the_welfare_state/2014/01/french_socialized_medicine_vs_u_s_health_care_having_a_baby_in_paris_is.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/business/moneybox/2014/01/140122_$BOX_Dispatches-Childbirth.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"100140127015\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2014-01-27T23:52:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"Business\",\n  \"author\": \"Claire Lundberg\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"health care\",\n    \"europe\",\n    \"france\",\n    \"obamacare\",\n    \"affordable care act\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "In France, a \u201ccostly\u201d doctor\u2019s appointment is actually free.", "keywords": "socialized medicine vs obamacare, socialized medicine vs us health care, health care in france, france health care spending, french health care system, french health insurance system vs united states, health care in france and the united states", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "socialized medicine vs obamacare, socialized medicine vs us health care, health care in france, france health care spending, french health care system, french health insurance system vs united states, health care in france and the united states", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.description": "In this series, an American in Paris pits the French welfare state against the U.S. market economy\u00a0in five key categories: childbirth and health care,  ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/business/moneybox/2014/01/140122_$BOX_Dispatches-Childbirth.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcb5a\"", "article_summary": "This kind of crowding, especially in bigger cities, is one of the downsides of a government-run health care system.\nI was adjusting to the outlandish notion that I would know the exact cost of my health care services before buying them.\n(France is also arguably more creative than U.S. health care providers in keeping childbirth costs down.\nFrom my French-ified perspective, a single-payer system\u2014with strong government oversight to keep the price of medical care low\u2014seems like the only way to go.\nLuckily, transparency in the price of medical care is a legal requirement in France."}
