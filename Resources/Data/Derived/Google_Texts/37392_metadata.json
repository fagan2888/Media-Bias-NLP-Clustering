But how Taft's principal handled it raised a few eyebrows.\n\nAn Oklahoma City police report written Monday morning said Taft Principal Helen Johnson didn't care that her school had been broken into. \u201cShe was not concerned with the theft or any sort of damage,\u201d the report read. \u201cShe really took the tone with me that she could not be bothered with this.\u201d\n\nSchool District Spokesperson Tierney Tinnin says that's not what really happened. \u201cAt the end of the day, it was one o'clock in the morning and what was said and what was perceived is not the way it was supposed to be. I can tell you she values taxpayer dollars. She's a wonderful person and competent leader,\u201d she said.\n\nTinnin said the school district has systems in place that handle these kinds of things.
