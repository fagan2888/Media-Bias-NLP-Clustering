An active weather trend began Sunday with gusty winds estimated over 60 mph and brought damage, possibly from tornadoes, from Texas to Iowa.

Today, more strong storms are possible.

Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama may be impacted with dangerous thunderstorms.

But what about snow?

Dramatically colder temperatures behind the cold front means some places that had temperature in the 70s over the weekend will barely reach the 50s today.

Some snow will fall across the Plains and Upper Midwest today, with more for New England tomorrow.

Now for even more exciting news.

A total lunar eclipse occurs tonight. It will be visible across North America, but most likely obscured by rain and clouds on the East Coast.

If you get a good view, however, let us know. Submit your pictures via iReport HERE and you may see them on "New Day" Tuesday.
