Put another way, one third of all military spending the world comes from the United States. The problem is, however, that the American military budget may be crowding out other crucial investments.\n\nAs the era of American hegemony winds down, it\u2019s more important than ever for America to be able to demonstrate soft power. That means first, an American model that works, for other countries to emulate. But further, it means a highly educated population, long-term investment in infrastructure, adequate healthcare, an society based, above all else, on opportunity. However, it\u2019s likely that the military budget precludes these important services.\n\nThe most important cost of our bloated military budget is investment in other important government functions. As the chart below from CBO shows, defense spending has historically consumed more than half of the entire U.S. government discretionary budget (spending on veterans eats up mandatory spending as well). In 2014, discretionary defense spending was double Medicaid spending, and about equal to Medicare spending.\n\nGiven that the U.S. is already a relatively low-spending country, the military only further diminishes our meager safety net.\n\nThe chart below shows that not only does the U.S. spend comparatively less of its GDP on government than other developed countries, military spending (the white/grey bar) takes up far more of it. That means America spends less on general public services, environmental protection and education than otherwise. But these services are key to America\u2019s ability to remain a global leader. Further, it means that American women are more likely to die in childbirth than women in China and our infrastructure pulls down global competitiveness. America spends far less than other rich countries on foreign aid, and dedicatesonly 1 billion dollars, a sliver of its budget to international affairs. In 2011, the Brookings Institution worried, \u201cthe United States is following an unfortunate path that other big countries, such as the former Soviet Union, have already taken in history, wasting too many resources and too much national wealth on military expansion, wars, and foreign interference.\u201d\n\nThe effect of our outsized budget is felt in other ways. Surplus goods are often sent to local police offices, who end up with grenade launchers, weaponized aircraft and \u201ctank-like armoured vehicles.\u201d Concomitantly, police killings have increased (according to the best data available) and the police have begun to seem like an occupying force. This has a profound effect on trust in civic institutions and the police. As trust in police officers decreases, they find it harder to do their job and the community grows even more skeptical. There\u2019s also the likely possibility that the availability of military force makes it more likely, by making non-military means less attractive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "America's armed forces are a massive drain on resources that could otherwise strengthen the country", "title": "The U.S. military is a national security threat", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "America's armed forces are a massive drain on resources that could otherwise strengthen the country", "title": "The U.S. military is a national security threat", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/24/the_u_s_military_is_a_national_security_threat/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/aircraft_carrier.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "America's armed forces are a massive drain on resources that could otherwise strengthen the country", "title": "The U.S. military is a national security threat", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/aircraft_carrier.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sean McElwee", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Memorial Day, Military-industrial complex, U.S. Military", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Memorial Day, Military-industrial complex, U.S. Military, News, Politics NewsThe American military budget is massive.\nThe problem is, however, that the American military budget may be crowding out other crucial investments.\nPut another way, one third of all military spending the world comes from the United States.\nThe most important cost of our bloated military budget is investment in other important government functions.\nHowever, it\u2019s likely that the military budget precludes these important services."}
