The duo, who co-authored the book, \u201cHeart: An American Medical Odyssey,\u201d discussed their decision to deactivate the device\u2019s wireless function for fear that it would be hacked by terrorists.\n\n\u201cIt seemed to me to be a bad idea for the Vice President of the United States to have a device that maybe somebody on a rope line or someone in the next hotel room or downstairs might be able to get into, hack into. And I worried that someone could kill you,\u201d Reiner said.\n\nAnd years later, his premonition hit televisions nationwide, as just that scenario unfolded on \u201cHomeland\u201d to the fictional vice president.\n\n\u201cWell, I was aware of the danger, if you will, that existed, but I found it credible,\u201d Cheney said of the show. \u201cbecause I knew from the experience we\u2019d had, the necessity for adjusting my own device, that it was an accurate portrayal of what was possible.\u201d\n\nDoctors implanted the defibrillator, which can control irregular heartbeats with electric jolts, near Cheney\u2019s heart in 2007. The former Vice President has had a long history of heart problems and suffered his first heart attack at the age of 37. He had a heart transplant last year, at 71 years old.\n\nDespite his medical history, though, Cheney said he never had any apprehensions his personal health would interfere with his duties as vice president.\n\nCheck out the interview below.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Former Vice President Dick Cheney detailed a fear that seemed made-for-tv, saying he had the wireless function deactivated on his defibrillator to prevent terrorists from shocking his heart into cardiac arrest.", "title": "[WATCH] Dick Cheney feared terrorists would hack defibrillator -...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2012/09/dick_cheney-600x800.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/10/19/watch-dick-cheney-feared-terrorists-would-hack-defibrillator/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "vice-president", "published_time": "2013-10-19T12:37:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-19T13:26:17+00:00", "author": "melissa.quinn.9461"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd20e6\"", "article_summary": "Former Vice President Dick Cheney detailed a fear that seemed made-for-tv, saying he had the wireless function deactivated on his defibrillator to prevent terrorists from shocking his heart into cardiac arrest.\nAnd years later, his premonition hit televisions nationwide, as just that scenario unfolded on \u201cHomeland\u201d to the fictional vice president.\nDespite his medical history, though, Cheney said he never had any apprehensions his personal health would interfere with his duties as vice president.\nThe former Vice President has had a long history of heart problems and suffered his first heart attack at the age of 37.\nCheney and his cardiologist Jonathan Reiner spoke to Dr. Sanjay Gupta on en episode of CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d set to air Sunday."}
