Bobby Jindal was in Washington on Monday to promote his new education initiatives and to lash out at the Common Core national education standards that have been warmly embraced by former Florida governor Jeb Bush, one of Jindal\u2019s potential rivals for the 2016 GOP presidential campaign.\n\nInstead he ended up spending a lot of time fending off embarrassing questions about his state\u2019s financial mess.\n\nRelated: Bobby Jindal\u2019s Failure Ruins Chances of Tax Reform\n\nJindal leveled his assault on Common Core during meetings with reporters where he touted his new 42-page, kindergarten through the 12th grade education blueprint.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense to me that folks in D.C know better than parents, teachers and local leaders,\u201d Jindal said of Common Core during a breakfast session sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor. \u201cI think the more people are exposed to Common Core and the more people are demanding it be taken out of the classrooms, the more the federal government will stop trying to force Common Core down the throats of local teachers, local parents and students.\u201d\n\nBush, whose early entry in the GOP presidential sweepstakes last month catapulted him to the top tier of likely candidates, is practically alone in his promotion of the Common Core educational standards that are anathema to many rock solid conservatives. The Common Core is a set of high-quality academic standards in mathematics and English that were devised by governors and state educators to set uniform learning goals.\n\nAlthough Jindal and other critics frequently characterize Common Core as a federal mandate, in fact 43 states and the District of Columbia have voluntarily adopted the standards and are moving towards their implementation.\n\nJindal yesterday sought to focus attention on his \u201cK-12 Education Reform: A Roadmap,\u201d which he reportedly believes will set him apart from Bush and other potential rivals should he enter the 2016 presidential field. \u201cAmerica is stuck in a rut on education, and has been for half a century,\u201d Jindal\u2019s document declares. He promotes the ideas of parental choice, limited government and educator freedom as the key to success, while dismissing Common Core as a monopoly government-provided education system.\n\nRelated: Jeb Bush Stands Firm on Common Core\n\nBut it was a rocky visit for Jindal who was repeatedly asked by reporters about Louisiana\u2019s dire financial straits, including a $1.6 billion budget deficit, the deepest per-student cuts in higher education of any state in the country and negative credit ratings by Moody\u2019s.\n\nOnce touted as a wunderkind of GOP politics and a future voice of the party, Jindal began his first term as governor in 2008 with a surplus of roughly $1 billion, high oil prices and a huge injection of federal disaster recovery money after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, according to the New York Times.\n\nThe new governor then backed the largest tax cut in the state\u2019s history. For a while Louisiana\u2019s economy blossomed. But after the Great Recession arrived, oil prices began to dip and the recovery money dried up, Louisiana\u2019s economy sputtered and Jindal has had to make many excuses for what went wrong.\n\nThe governor and Louisiana Legislature refuse to raise taxes, and instead are relying on temporary funding sources, such as revenue from property sales and trust funds \u2013 to keep the government afloat.\n\nRelated: 4 Issues That Could Derail Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 Hopes\n\nYesterday, Jindal bobbed and weaved when reporters pressed him to explain why voters should consider him for president when his state\u2019s economy and public university system are in shambles.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Jindal responded with a blizzard of statistics regarding teachers\u2019 salaries, private sector job growth, the state\u2019s payroll, graduation rates, official ethics and even low-birth-weight babies \u2013 covering just about everything except what the reporters wanted to know.\n\n\u201cThe reality is this,\u201d Jindal finally said. \u201cJust like other states during the Great Recession, we faced an issue of what to do with declining revenue. We also cut income taxes \u2013 the largest income tax cut. We made the decision. As a result, our budget is...smaller than when I took office, we have 31,000 few state employees than we\u2019ve had in decades.... More importantly, our private sector economy is stronger than it has been in a generation.\u201d\n\nJindal, 43, typically attracts single-digit voter interest in national polls gauging Republican sentiment in the 2016 presidential contest. And a recent survey by Public Policy Polling found that 53 percent of Louisiana voters disapprove of their governor\u2019s job performance.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Louisiana Gov.", "title": "Bobby Jindal Can\u2019t Shake Louisiana\u2019s Financial Mess", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/10/Bobby-Jindal-Can-t-Shake-Louisiana-s-Financial-Mess", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01252013_Bobby_Jindal_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/10/Bobby-Jindal-Can-t-Shake-Louisiana-s-Financial-Mess", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01252013_Bobby_Jindal_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Louisiana Gov.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe5237\"", "article_summary": "Instead he ended up spending a lot of time fending off embarrassing questions about his state\u2019s financial mess.\n\u201cIt makes no sense to me that folks in D.C know better than parents, teachers and local leaders,\u201d Jindal said of Common Core during a breakfast session sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor.\nThe Common Core is a set of high-quality academic standards in mathematics and English that were devised by governors and state educators to set uniform learning goals.\nHe promotes the ideas of parental choice, limited government and educator freedom as the key to success, while dismissing Common Core as a monopoly government-provided education system.\nRelated: Bobby Jindal\u2019s Failure Ruins Chances of Tax ReformJindal leveled his assault on Common Core during meetings with reporters where he touted his new 42-page, kindergarten through the 12th grade education blueprint."}
