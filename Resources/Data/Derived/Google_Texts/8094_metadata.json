Fun fact: The RNC spent $9 million to help Bob McDonnell win the governor\u2019s seat four years ago. This year, in a much tougher election, they spent $3 million on Ken Cuccinelli, with Cooch so strapped for cash at the end that he had to abandon the D.C. media market the last two weeks. Not all of his money problems were the RNC\u2019s fault \u2014 McAuliffe dominated Cuccinelli in fundraising (as expected) and centrist outside groups like the Chamber of Commerce ignored him \u2014 but the big drop-off in spending between 2009 and 2013 naturally has people pointing fingers at Reince Priebus and company.\n\nWe\u2019re getting a bad rap, says the RNC:\n\nRepublican National Committee allies are offering an interesting defense to critics saying the campaign committee could have done more to help the Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli: Blame former RNC chairman Michael Steele. Steele dropped a staggering $9 million in 2009 into Governor Bob McDonnell\u2019s race despite the fact that McDonnell never trailed in a single poll. \u201cIn my opinion, it was just frivolous spending,\u201d says a Republican source close to the campaign in Virginia. \u201cWe were paying off that race in 2011 when we should have been getting ready for the presidential,\u201d the source says. \u201cIt handcuffed us.\u201d\u2026 Another data point is the New Jersey gubernatorial race in 2009, when the RNC spent around $3 million to help now-governor Chris Christie \u2013 about the same amount it spent on Cuccinelli, but in a more expensive state.\n\nIn other words, the reason the drop-off over the past four years is so sharp isn\u2019t because the RNC short-changed Cuccinelli, it\u2019s because Michael Steele stupidly showered cash on a candidate in 2009 who didn\u2019t really need it. Jim Geraghty (who\u2019s compiled a nifty list of reasons to blame, or not blame, the RNC) adds several other exculpating factors. The RNC actually outspent the DNC in Virginia; outside groups and wealthy Republican donors, whose contributions to pro-Cuccinelli Super PACs would have been unlimited, didn\u2019t swoop in to fill the fundraising gap (possibly/probably because they disliked Cooch\u2019s tea-party credentials) and the few who tried like the RGA didn\u2019t do a smart job of spending their money; and nearly every poll had Cuccinelli losing badly, which meant the RNC might reasonably have believed it\u2019d be throwing its money away by spending more in Virginia. There are lots of important races next year that they\u2019ll need to spend on. They don\u2019t have money to burn. Gotta pick and choose.\n\nAnd yet the fact remains: When it came time to vote, Cuccinelli wasn\u2019t a lost cause. Why didn\u2019t the RNC see that coming? Geraghty notes that they ended up spending $1.5 million in New Jersey to help pad Christie\u2019s landslide while Cooch was all but abandoned down the stretch by national Republicans. Said one Cuccinelli advisor to WaPo, \u201cThere are a lot of questions people are going to be asking and that is, was leaving Cuccinelli alone in the first week of October, a smart move? We were on our own. Just look at the volume [of ads].\u201d What makes that inexcusable isn\u2019t that the RNC\u2019s polling didn\u2019t show the race being tight (although that\u2019s \u2026 pretty inexcusable), it\u2019s the fact that the ruinous ObamaCare rollout of the past three weeks gave Republicans every reason to believe there might be a pro-GOP bounce near the end. That wasn\u2019t worth an extra million? Jonah Goldberg wonders:\n\nIn fairness, the Republican Governor\u2019s Association did help Cuccinelli, but it came too early. The RNC treated him like a write-off. I can understand that temptation when Cuccinelli looked like a sure loser. But I don\u2019t understand why, when ObamaCare became a big issue, the RNC couldn\u2019t have done more. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard to ramp up at the last second. But so what? Things are going to be hard in lots of ways for as far as the eye can see. Hard can\u2019t be an excuse anymore. As for the more moderate Republican donors who stayed away from Cuccinelli, I certainly don\u2019t think they\u2019re obliged to give money to anyone or anything they disagree with. So maybe they\u2019re pro-choice. Maybe they call themselves \u201csocially liberal but fiscally conservative\u201d (don\u2019t get me started). Fine. But on the issues that make them Republican, McAuliffe will still be far more of a disaster than Cuccinelli ever would have been. McAuliffe says his first priority for the legislative session is accepting the expanded Medicare option under ObamaCare. That\u2019s bad enough, but does anyone doubt that another, equally important, priority of his will be to prepare the ground for a Clinton candidacy should she run?\n\nForget about the pros and cons of Cuccinelli the politician for a second. Forget even whether an O-Care backlash really did help Cooch close the gap; that\u2019s debatable. The fact is, Democrats on the Hill would have identified ObamaCare as the culprit if Cuccinelli had eked out a narrow victory over a guy who massively outspent him and maintained a sizable polling lead until the end. If you want red-state Dems to run screaming from the ACA, shocking a Clinton crony who looked poised for an easy win in a bellwether state could have done the trick. Which is not to say all is lost: There are a few dopey liberal pundits on Twitter this morning insisting that Virginia was a \u201cvictory for ObamaCare\u201d or something because McAuliffe managed to survive, but rest assured, that\u2019s not the lesson being drawn by Mark Pryor and Mary Landrieu given the narrowness of the margin. Even so, an outright win for Cuccinelli would have sent a much more powerful message. So why didn\u2019t the RNC \u2014 and outside groups, and Republican millionaires/billionaires \u2014 do more to make it happen? They weren\u2019t really more interested in seeing a tea-party star get his \u201ccomeuppance\u201d than seizing power in a purple state like Virginia, were they?\n\nAnd by the way: No, the fake libertarian didn\u2019t cost Cuccinelli the election.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Abandoned?", "title": "RNC: Hey, don\u2019t blame us for Cuccinelli\u2019s loss", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/11/06/rnc-hey-dont-blame-us-for-cuccinellis-loss/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "cuccinelli, McAuliffe, ObamaCare, rnc, spending, Virginia,", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-06T18:21:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-06T19:13:03+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8292\"", "article_summary": "RNC: Hey, don\u2019t blame us for Cuccinelli\u2019s lossposted at 1:21 pm on November 6, 2013 by AllahpunditA footnote to Erika\u2019s post about lessons to take from Cuccinelli\u2019s almost-but-not-quite upset.\nJonah Goldberg wonders:In fairness, the Republican Governor\u2019s Association did help Cuccinelli, but it came too early.\nJim Geraghty (who\u2019s compiled a nifty list of reasons to blame, or not blame, the RNC) adds several other exculpating factors.\nFun fact: The RNC spent $9 million to help Bob McDonnell win the governor\u2019s seat four years ago.\n\u201cIn my opinion, it was just frivolous spending,\u201d says a Republican source close to the campaign in Virginia."}
