Federico Lombardi, said the pope\u2019s remarks were \u201cobviously a sign of goodwill for dialogue\u201d with China as well as the other countries in Asia with which the Vatican doesn\u2019t have diplomatic relations: North Korea, Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos, Bhutan and Brunei. \u201cThis offer of the pope for dialogue is to all these lands and not just one, even if China is the biggest,\u201d he said.\n\nHe acknowledged that Francis has so far refrained on the trip from making any outwardly political statement about China, which counts some 12 million Catholics, but that the speech was a clear affirmation of a desire for dialogue with Beijing. It was also a message to the bishops who might be working in countries, directly or indirectly, that they can sow the seeds for dialogue through charitable works and educational services even before official diplomatic relations with the Holy See are established.\n\nChina cut relations with the Vatican in 1951, after the Communist Party took power and set up its own church outside the pope\u2019s authority. China persecuted the church for years until restoring a degree of religious freedom and freeing imprisoned priests in the late 1970s. The Vatican under then-Pope Benedict XVI sought to improve ties by seeking to unify the state-sanctioned church with the underground church still loyal to Rome.\n\nVatican-China ties have already broken new ground on Francis\u2019 first Asian trip, with Beijing agreeing to let Francis\u2019 Alitalia charter fly through its airspace; when St. John Paul II last came to South Korea in 1989, Beijing refused to let him fly overhead. With the fly-by confirmed, Francis sent the traditional greetings he sends to the leadership of countries he flies over. That said, there have been reports that some Chinese Catholics who wanted to participate in the Asian Catholic youth festival here were prevented from coming.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pope urges \u2018fraternal\u2019 dialogue with China, others", "author": "Nicole Winfield", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Pope urges \u2018fraternal\u2019 dialogue with China, others", "title": "Pope urges \u2018fraternal\u2019 dialogue with China, others", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/17/pope_urges_fraternal_dialogue_with_china_others/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/south-korea-pope.jpeg23-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pope urges \u2018fraternal\u2019 dialogue with China, others", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/south-korea-pope.jpeg23-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Pope urges \u2018fraternal\u2019 dialogue with China, others", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Pope urges \u2018fraternal\u2019 dialogue with China, others", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb1d2\"", "article_summary": "Then deviating from his text, he added: \u201cI\u2019m not talking here only about a political dialogue, but about a fraternal dialogue,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThis offer of the pope for dialogue is to all these lands and not just one, even if China is the biggest,\u201d he said.\nChina persecuted the church for years until restoring a degree of religious freedom and freeing imprisoned priests in the late 1970s.\nChina cut relations with the Vatican in 1951, after the Communist Party took power and set up its own church outside the pope\u2019s authority.\nWith the fly-by confirmed, Francis sent the traditional greetings he sends to the leadership of countries he flies over."}
