He added that the law didn\u2019t destroy the job market, despite pessimistic predictions from critics.\n\n\"Our businesses have created jobs every single month since it became law,\" Obama said on Capitol Hill on Jan. 12, 2016.\n\nWe hadn\u2019t heard that particular Obamacare talking point before, so we decided to take a look.\n\nBecause Obama referred specifically to \"our businesses,\" we looked at private-sector employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics starting in March 2010, when Obama signed the Affordable Care Act .\n\nOf the 70 months since, Obama is correct that every single one has seen positive job growth. That\u2019s a record for uninterrupted job growth, according to our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker .\n\nThis graph from BLS shows monthly change in private-sector job growth (in thousands) since the start of 2010:\n\nFrom early 2010 on, the data is above the zero line, showing positive job growth.\n\nThe fact that the country has gained jobs despite the health care law also might not assuage critics\u2019 argument that job growth, and other aspects of the economy, would have been stronger absent the law.\n\nFor example, in a January 2015 fact-check , we found that the law might have caused many thousands of employees to have their hours cut from full-time to part-time.\n\nBut independent studies haven\u2019t backed up claims that the law would end up reducing employment. In 2011, we rated a claim from former Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., that Obamacare is \"job killing\" False .\n\nFormer Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in 2014 that Obamacare is \"expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs.\" We rated that claim Mostly False .\n\nOur ruling\n\nObama said, \"Our businesses have created jobs every single month since (Obamacare) became law.\"\n\nThe private sector has seen job growth every single month since Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in March 2010.\n\nThere\u2019s room for argument over what the growth would have looked like absent the health care law, but Obama\u2019s statistic is on target.
