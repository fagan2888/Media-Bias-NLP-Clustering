As traditional insurers' profits recede, regulatory bodies have their eyes on the insurance industry's wave of consolidation, and locally-sponsored plans with community ties are ideally positioned to step in. Moreover, providers can use their forays into insurance to lobby for a regulatory environment that helps them act as a safety net.\n\nAlthough the timing may be right, Keckley also recommends that organizations consider whether they are capable of maintaining the service line. Administrating the plans aren't easy and there are no short-cuts, he writes. However, many organizations are successful if they develop an effective plan design, actuarial risk analyses and pricing, member enrollment and customer service.\n\nTrust should also be a factor, he writes. Hospitals are in a good position because they enjoy far higher levels of trust from the public than insurers, he says, but they must continue to earn that trust rather than using their plans to charge higher premiums or offer poor service. On the contrary, rather than upholding the status quo, they must focus on desgining programs and services that feed the transition from a collection of independent institutions to an integrated system, Keckley writes.\n\nIn 20 years, Keckley predicts, community healthcare will manifest as a fully integrated system with its own health plan. \"And I am confident consumers, employers and other purchasers will reward provider-sponsored plans that perform well and punish those that don't,\" he writes.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read Keckley's article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nProvider-led health plans are still rare, but a growing number on insurance marketplaces\n\nMore hospitals interested in launching health plans\n\nSenate panel grills Aetna, Anthem execs on merger deals\n\nFuture of healthcare will alter roles of both payers and providers\n\nHow UPMC used big data and integrated care to reduce readmissions\n\nConsumers, providers have trust issues with health insurers\n\nHealth insurers, providers don't have to settle for 'frenemy' status\n\nHow insurers can make transparency tools more consumer-friendly\n\nThe unhealthy payer-provider marriage\n\nHospitals as insurers: Competition, costs, and considerations [Special Report]", "article_metadata": {"description": "More and more hospitals are offering their own health plans, but success may hinge on the timing of the launch,\u00a0according to\u00a0Paul Keckley, Ph.D., managing director for the Navigant Center for Healthcare Research and Policy Analysis.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "More and more hospitals are offering their own health plans, but success may hinge on the timing of the launch,\u00a0according to\u00a0Paul Keckley, Ph.D., managing director for the Navigant Center for Healthcare Research and Policy Analysis.", "title": "Hospital-sponsored health plans: Why now may be the right time to launch", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospital-sponsored-health-plans-why-now-may-be-right-time-launch/2016-01-05", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,community health needs,health insurers,HR & Workforce Management,Integrated Care,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,Population Health Management,provider-sponsored insurance plans", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1319\"", "article_summary": "\"Timing is everything,\" he writes in a post for Hospitals & Health Networks.\nMore and more hospitals are offering their own health plans, but success may hinge on the timing of the launch, according to Paul Keckley, Ph.D., managing director for the Navigant Center for Healthcare Research and Policy Analysis.\nIn 20 years, Keckley predicts, community healthcare will manifest as a fully integrated system with its own health plan.\n\"And I am confident consumers, employers and other purchasers will reward provider-sponsored plans that perform well and punish those that don't,\" he writes.\nAlthough the timing may be right, Keckley also recommends that organizations consider whether they are capable of maintaining the service line."}
