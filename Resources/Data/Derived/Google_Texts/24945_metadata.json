(Hint: think particle collider.)\n\nThe writer and creators of the CW Network\u2019s \u201cArrow,\u201d Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim and Andrew Kreisberg, knew that to introduce an actual superhero, much less his superpowers, was going to be a delicate and slow endeavor, one grounded in real people in a real world, but with a heightened reality, according to Kreisberg.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still a little nervous but feel really good,\u201d Kreisberg told the Journal, sitting in his office in Burbank, Calif. Posters of a shirtless Stephen Amell, who plays Oliver Queen, the billionaire playboy and the Arrow\u2019s alter ego, are tacked up around the space.\n\nBarry Allen\u2019s alter ego, the Flash, will also be introduced in the sophomore year of \u201cArrow,\u201d albeit not until the latter part of the 22-episode season.\n\nTo continue its reign as the network\u2019s most watched show, \u201cArrow\u201d is also bending its own rules. No longer are flashbacks strictly for the lead protagonist, in fact, Kreisberg alluded to Felicity (Emily Bett Rickards), Diggle (David Ramsey) and Laurel (Katie Cassidy) all flashing-back this season.\n\n\u201cA lot more is directly tied to what\u2019s happening in present day, flashbacks will be more like memories,\u201d he said.\n\nJust down the hall, Berlanti, who moved the offices of \u201cThe Tomorrow People,\u201d his newest CW show with longtime friend Julie Plec, is seated in a sparse office. Next to the sofa a small framed \u201cArrow\u201d poster leans against the wall on the floor with a pink post-it attached that reads \u201cA small thanks for a very big year \u2013 Andrew.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re speeding things up a bit this season, we\u2019re working with six act structure, which means every six to seven minutes, there\u2019s going to be a jolt, something that happens to the characters,\u201d explained Berlanti.\n\nThat pacing also allows for a greater introduction of characters, several from the DC Comics universe like the Black Canary and the Bronze Tiger.\n\n\u201cThere will be some people with meta-human abilities, grounded in science, but ones that normal people don\u2019t have\u201d Berlanti said. Think of it as a kind of baby-step towards a full superpower.\n\nWith those abilities also come the actions and reactions of the \u201cnormal people,\u201d according to Guggenheim, whose office is splashed with sunlight and decidedly smaller than the other two.\n\n\u201cJust think of what we can do with Felicity,\u201d Guggenheim said. \u201cHow we lay in the puzzle pieces, there\u2019s a component of the show that will speak to the increased abilities with a real world explanation, and there\u2019s reactions grounded in reality. You can buy someone being incredibly strong, teleporting, though, that\u2019s a different kettle of fish.\u201d\n\nThe trio is already looking to the third season of \u201cArrow,\u201d talking about having events in Central City, where Barry Allen/the Flash hails from.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with a much larger canvas than we were allotted last year, and we\u2019ve got to keep growing our universe,\u201d said Guggenheim.\n\nFor more entertainment and television coverage, follow @alexandracheney.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Nobody has even mentioned the Flash yet on \"Arrow.\" But he's coming.", "title": "\u2018Arrow\u2019 Looks to Launch a New Hero: The Flash", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/10/16/arrow/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AA314_arrow_E_20131016133258.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "\u2018Arrow\u2019 Looks to Launch a New Hero: The Flash", "description": "Nobody has even mentioned the Flash yet on \"Arrow.\" But he's coming.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "Alexandra Cheney", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "Nobody has even mentioned the Flash yet on \"Arrow.\" But he's coming.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-10-16T23:00:36-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/10/16/arrow/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-77710", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Nobody has even mentioned the Flash yet on \"Arrow.\" But he's coming.", "title": "\u2018Arrow\u2019 Looks to Launch a New Hero: The Flash", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/10/16/arrow/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-77710", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-10-16T23:49:01-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd996e\"", "article_summary": "Barry Allen\u2019s alter ego, the Flash, will also be introduced in the sophomore year of \u201cArrow,\u201d albeit not until the latter part of the 22-episode season.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still a little nervous but feel really good,\u201d Kreisberg told the Journal, sitting in his office in Burbank, Calif.\nTo continue its reign as the network\u2019s most watched show, \u201cArrow\u201d is also bending its own rules.\n\u201cThere will be some people with meta-human abilities, grounded in science, but ones that normal people don\u2019t have\u201d Berlanti said.\n\u201cA lot more is directly tied to what\u2019s happening in present day, flashbacks will be more like memories,\u201d he said."}
