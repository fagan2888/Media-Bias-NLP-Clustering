Cruz held hearings to stop the court\u2019s \u201clawlessness\u201d and \u201cjudicial tyranny,\u201d which were titled \u201cWith Prejudice: Supreme Court Activism and Possible Solutions.\u201d\n\nThis has nothing to do with the court\u2019s conservative rulings on guns, campaign spending and blocking the Environmental Protection Agency. Cruz\u2019s search for \u201coptions the American people have to rein in judicial tyranny\u201d only responds to the Obamacare and same-sex marriage decisions: \u201cMuch to my great disappointment this past term, the court crossed a line and continued its long descent into lawlessness to a level that I believe demands action.\u201d\n\nTime to change the Constitution, opines Cruz, to stop the Supreme Court from \u201cdeclar(ing) itself as a super legislature.\u201d His suggestions include: Judges running for retention every eight years, giving justices term limits, allowing a majority of states to override the Supreme Court and allowing a two-thirds vote of Congress to overturn the Supreme Court.\n\nBut Cruz claims to be an Originalist \u2014 someone who believes we should read the Constitution as the Framers intended. Although the Framers did not write out the court\u2019s power of judicial review, they provided for the judicial branch, intending it to do just that. Our country began with the Declaration of Independence indicting King George III\u2019s attack on judicial independence. \u201cHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\u201d\n\nThe Framers provided for a judicial branch exactly because the Articles of Confederation had none. James Madison, the father of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, recognized the problem of protecting individual rights. \u201cRepeated violations of these parchment barriers have been committed by overbearing majorities in every state.\u201d\n\nFederal courts were the answer, as Madison explained in The Federalist Papers: \u201c(I)ndependent tribunals of justice (who would) consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights; they will be an impenetrable bulwark against any assumption of power in the Legislative or Executive; they will be naturally led to resist every encroachment upon rights expressly stipulated for in the Constitution by the declaration of rights.\u201d\n\nMadison\u2019s Federalist Papers co-author, Alexander Hamilton, noted the value of a Supreme Court over the states to provide national unity: \u201cThirteen independent courts of final jurisdiction over the same causes, arising upon the same laws, is a hydra in government from which nothing but contradiction and confusion can proceed.\u201d\n\nThe courts are the best guardians of rights because the court \u201chas no influence over either the sword or the purse (and is) beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power.\u201d\n\nMadison, Hamilton and the rest of the Framers did not work in a vacuum. English common law and constitutional custom gave us a powerful tradition of judicial review. In 1610, Chief Justice Court of Common Pleas Sir Edward Coke in Dr. Bonham\u2019s Case held a court could find the common law trumps Parliament. A generation later, John Lilburne\u2019s Agreement of the People (1647-1649) noted constitutions trump Parliament. A century later, William Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries provided natural law trumps Parliament because \u201cno human legislature has power to abridge or destroy ... (t)hose rights which God and nature has established.\u201d From this tradition, the Framers created the federal courts with the power of judicial review.\n\nSure, there were dissenters. John Rutledge of South Carolina argued that federal courts are an \u201cunnecessary encroachment on the jurisdiction (of the States).\u201d Patrick Henry, who opposed the whole Constitution, argued, \u201cI see arising from the extensive jurisdiction of these paramount Courts, the State Courts must soon be annihilated.\u201d Because Rutledge and Henry lost we have the U.S. Constitution.\n\nMaybe Cruz can point to Thomas Jefferson\u2019s reaction to Marbury v. Madison (1803), in which Jefferson\u2019s cousin John Marshall established judicial review. Jefferson was unhappy because the Federalists stacked the courts with Jefferson opponents. The Constitution, Jefferson grumbled, was now \u201ca mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary, which they may twist and shape into any form they please.\u201d\n\nBut 10 years before on March 15, 1789, Jefferson wrote to Madison that a Bill of Rights is good because of \u201cthe legal check which it puts into the hands of the judiciary.\u201d Jefferson at the time was not in power and had not lost before the court.\n\nAs any Jefferson historian will attest, the slaveholding declarer that \u201call men are created equal\u201d could be inconsistent when expedient, if not hypocritical. First extolling the judiciary as a \u201clegal check\u201d to guarantee rights and later bemoaning the court\u2019s power of judicial review because he didn\u2019t like the ruling is classic Jefferson. In this affinity to Thomas Jefferson, Ted Cruz appears an Originalist after all.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Richmond Times-Dispatch", "description": "\u201cTime to rein in the United States Supreme Court,\u201d pronounces Ted Cruz, junior senator for Texas, self-professed disciple of Originalism and aspiring presidential candidate.
