Steve Beshear (D-KY), who told CNN that his state-operated exchange, Kynect, is working well in Kentucky. \u201cWe\u2019re signing up people at roughly a thousand a day. It\u2019s a great rate and a great success so far,\u201d he told on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d describing the market as \u201ca gold standard because it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nRep. Renee Ellmers (R-NC) dismissed the state\u2019s progress, however, insisting that Obamacare has \u201ccompletely failed\u201d and arguing that the governor is praising the program for political purposes:\n\nELLMERS: I know you had the clip of the governor and God bless him. He\u2019s talking about a situation that he supports. American people cannot wait for this. There are hard working taxpayers \u2014 CAROL COSTELLO (HOST): Was the governor joshing us? Is he not telling the truth? ELLMERS: I\u2019m not exactly sure it is working in Kentucky\u2026.. COSTELLO: So the governor when he says he\u2019s signing up 1,000 people a day and wants to get the 640,000 people in Kentucky insured, he\u2019s just saying that for political purposes? ELLMERS: Well, you know, let\u2019s look again at the grand scheme of things. It is a failure at monumental levels. [\u2026] COSTELLO: But you\u2019re discounting everything that the Kentucky governor is saying. Instead of sitting down with him and saying, governor, let\u2019s talk and figure this out together. Let\u2019s figure out what\u2019s political in what you\u2019re saying. You\u2019re discounting what he has to say outright.\n\nUnable to directly respond to Kentucky\u2019s enrollment numbers, Ellmers confronted Costello, saying, \u201cyou\u2019re getting awfully angry about this situation!\u201d Watch it:\n\nThough the federal HealthCare.gov appears to face serious technical problems, state-run marketplaces like Kentucky appear adept at quickly fixing problems and are successfully enrolling people. In Kentucky, 10,766 applications for health coverage were initiated on the first day and \u201c6,909 completed and 2,989 families were enrolled.\u201d Nearly 150,000 New Yorkers have signed up for Obamacare and 35,528 enrollments were completed in three weeks in Washington state.\n\n\u201cTake a deep breath,\u201d Beshear told CNN. \u201cThe only thing that really isn\u2019t working right now on the federal level is the website. I\u2019ll guarantee you that whether it\u2019s a week from now, a month from now, two months from now, they\u2019ll get it up and they\u2019ll get it working. People will be signing up.\u201d\n\nWant to see more of this kind of reporting?
