Kim Kardashian’s naked butt cover for Paper magazine, which garnered tremendous attention on social media and was the butt of many jokes on late-night TV, was naturally mentioned on this week’s “SNL.” During “Weekend Update,” anchors Michael Che and Colin Jost noted how Kardashian’s rearend seemed to have trumped all other news this past week (video below).

Che mentioned how, among other stories, there was a robotic spacecraft that landed on a comet but no one cared because they were more interested in Kardashian’s butt. He said the cover of Paper, featuring the reality star’s naked butt was viewed by “more than 16 million people, so thank you Kim, I can now find porn by just googling the word “paper.”

Jost, trying to switch gears to “real news,” talked about how open enrollment for Obamacare for 2015 began and that the president urged people to check their “insurance options on HealthCare.gov, except they can’t because someone broke the Internet.” Che then smiling added, “That ass!”

Like Che, there were others who admired Kardashian’s posterior this past week. Lorde wrote on Tumblr that she thought the nude shot was “pure heaven” and that Kardashian gets sexier with time like a “fineass wine.” And Alyssa Milano also complimented her on her “unbelievable ass.”

And there were plenty of stars who mocked her rump photo. Chelsea Handler first spoofed Kardashian with her own naked butt photo on Instagram. Others who later posted parodies of the Paper cover include Zach Braff, Dane Cook and Miley Cyrus.
