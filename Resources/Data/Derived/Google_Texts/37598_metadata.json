They embraced the strategy of tying the continued funding of government to an impossible demand.\n\nObamacare isn't just the president's signature legislative accomplishment. It isn't just a law that he dedicated 13 of the first 14 months of his presidency to passing. It isn't just a law that Democrats paid for dearly by losing control of the House of Representatives in 2010. Enacting some sort of national health care program has been a prevailing goal of liberals for decades, arguably for a century.\n\nDemanding that Obama, having survived re-election with the Democratic Senate majority intact, defund this law in exchange for keeping the government running is like asking that hypothetical employer for $10 million. Expecting him to cave is pure fantasy. Do conservatives think that they are the only ones who can apply pressure? Do they somehow forget that there are liberal activists on the other side who would crucify Obama were he to give in to the defund effort?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Beneath the hardline approach to the budget fight being pushed by Tea Party activists and their allies in Congress, there is a certain assumption about how negotiations work.\nThe idea is that if they force Republicans to publicly stake out the most uncompromising position possible, even if they don\u2019t achieve that end, then the inevitable agreement will be further to the right than it otherwise would have been.\nThere\u2019s no doubt that when approaching a negotiation, the starting position should be more ambitious than where one is willing to settle.
