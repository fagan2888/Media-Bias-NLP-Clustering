YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) - On a visit to Armenia, Kim Kardashian has seen that stardomâ€™s privileges have limits.

Kardashian, along with husband Kanye West, their daughter and her sister Khloe on Saturday were in Gyumri, a city 90 kilometers (55 miles) northwest of the capital Yerevan, where records show some Kardashian ancestors lived.

When the entourage went into the Cathedral of the Holy Mother of God, bodyguards tried to close its doors to keep journalists and onlookers away. But the local bishop, Mikayel Adjapagian, sharply objected to obstructing worshippers from the church.

The bodyguards relented and the doors stayed open.

Afterwards, the Kardashians and cameramen shooting footage for their reality show went to a house where ancestors once lived. The house is currently unoccupied.
