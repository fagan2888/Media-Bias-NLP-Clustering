Aeromexico has apologized to Sikh designer and actor Waris Ahluwalia after he says he was barred from boarding his flight from Mexico City to New York because he refused to remove his turban during security screening.

“We apologize to Mr. Waris Ahluwalia for the bad experience he had with one of our security elements in addressing [his] flight to New York in the Mexico City International Airport,” the airline said in a statement Tuesday, according to a Google translation. “This case motivates us to ensure that security personnel strengthen its care protocols, always respecting the cultural and religious values ​​of customers.”

Mr. Ahluwalia, who has appeared in 17 films, including “Inside Man,” “The Grand Budapest Hotel” and “The Darjeeling Limited,” said he originally consented to the “annoying” security measures at the Mexico City airport, but drew the line when he was asked to remove his turban, the New York Daily News reported.

“That is not something that I would do in public,” he explained. “That’s akin to asking someone to take off their clothes.”

Mr. Ahluwalia said his request to be taken to a private screening room was denied.

“You will not be flying Aeromexico,” an airline employee told him, Mr. Ahluwalia said. “You will need to book another flight.”

“I was shaking at first,” he said. “That’s not a nice thing to be told, that you are not allowed to fly on this plane because of something you are wearing, or because of your religious beliefs.”

Mr. Ahluwalia posted about the incident on Instagram, sparking a wave of backlash against the airline. The New York actor remained in Mexico City on Monday night awaiting an apology from Aeromexico, and a promise from the airline that they would train staff to better work with Sikhs, the Daily News reported.

There has been no news yet on whether Mr. Ahluwalia has boarded a flight back to the U.S.
