The other is about data security \u2014 complying with business and regulatory standards aimed at keeping data out of the hands of bad actors.\n\nRanking below those, yet still worrisome, is coping with increased scrutiny by finance and accounting regulators as they look deeply into issues far afield from the usual work of finance managers. Those include the requirement for companies to report the presence of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d in their companies\u2019 supply chains and document that they have thoroughly investigated whether corporate officials are paying bribes abroad.\n\nAll of that adds up to a swiftly burgeoning package of compliance challenges facing CFOs in the upcoming year. For that reason, finance chiefs are placed in the position of approving bigger compliance budgets, according to CFO\u2019s September survey of senior finance executives.\n\nNearly half of the respondents said their companies\u2019 compliance budgets will rise in 2014, with 18% expecting hikes of 10% or more and 29% looking at a rise of less than 10%. Forty-five percent forecast flat compliance budgets.\n\nMuch of the spending will be triggered by the actions of legislators and regulators, creating new rules and deadlines that demand a response. But changes in companies\u2019 structure and size and their increasing tendency to expand globally are forcing the added compliance spending at least as much as the rule makers are, some finance chiefs say.\n\nEarl Fry, CFO of Informatica, a data-integration software company, expects that the firm\u2019s 2014 compliance budget will be at least double what it was in 2012. To be sure, some of that increase is a response to new worries about data security and stepped-up scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board related to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\nYet the predicted surge in Informatica\u2019s compliance spending is more in tandem with the firm\u2019s expansion than with increasing red tape, Fry says. Estimating that the $861 million company will pass the $1 billion revenue mark in 2014, he notes that the company\u2019s global footprint, which currently covers 30 countries, increases every year, and that its employee count will rise by 15% to 20%.\n\nAdd to that a broadening platform of the firm\u2019s product offerings, particularly featuring cloud integration, and it becomes clear that \u201cgrowth in the company and the complexity of dealing with a global business and in dealing with data\u201d is the biggest driver of compliance activity, Fry says.\n\nA Change in Structure\n\nConversely, for some companies a change in structure can lead to diminished compliance burdens. \u201cWe are pretty fortunate in that we are no longer a public company,\u201d says Darren Heffernan, CFO of Trintech, a previously public financial-reporting software firm acquired in December 2010 by Spectrum Equity Investors. \u201cA lot of things that would concern me out in the marketplace don\u2019t specifically apply to us.\u201d\n\nHeffernan estimates that the company spent about $1 million a year \u201cfor the privilege of being a public company.\u201d Yet Trintech\u2019s decrease in spending on internal compliance \u2014 about 50% \u2014 is virtually a wash against the 50% increase Heffernan expects in spending this year on upgrading systems and hiring staff to help a growing number of clients comply with their own rules and standards.\n\nFor example, a growing number of the firm\u2019s clients in Europe, Asia and Australia have regulatory protection of their data handling that they don\u2019t want to risk losing by moving to Trintech\u2019s systems in the United States, according to the CFO. In such cases, the firm has sometimes had to pay to provide a separate data center in the client\u2019s country of origin, he notes.\n\nAs data-centric as his firm is, however, the first thought that comes to Heffernan\u2019s mind when asked about the company\u2019s biggest compliance challenges next year echoes that of a large swath of his peers: the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have enough data yet to know whether I should really be worried about it for next year,\u201d he says.\n\nAs the firm proceeded through its fall budgeting season, the finance chief says, he discovered that \u201cit just seems like there are so many unknown factors about what insurance companies are going to do with the premiums.\u201d\n\nNormally, Trintech\u2019s health insurer based the company\u2019s premiums on its claims history. \u201cBut we\u2019ve had indications from our provider that they may have to increase the premiums for next year depending on what they think is going to be put on their backs\u201d by the ACA, Heffernan said. \u201cWill it grow by 10%? Twenty percent? The money is one factor, but it\u2019s the unknown that\u2019s more worrisome. I can\u2019t budget or plan for that.\u201d\n\nThe recent Congressional brouhaha over health reform has helped make complying with it top-of-mind for many senior finance executives. In the CFO survey, 32% of respondents said health care reform will be of \u201chigh concern\u201d in the upcoming year, while 30% expect it to be a \u201cmoderate concern.\u201d\n\nStiffening Defenses\n\nAlthough the need to stiffen corporate defenses against data breaches seems a less urgent compliance concern than complying with the ACA, data security appears to be the more widely felt issue. While 25% of the survey respondents characterized it as a matter of high concern, 44% felt that it was at least a moderate anxiety.\n\nTrailing health reform and data security as compliance concerns are tax rules (with 52% of the respondents expressing high or moderate concern) and accounting standards (42%). About 10% had at least moderate worries about complying with the SEC\u2019s conflict minerals rules.\n\nWhile data security, health care reform and similarly much-debated issues inevitability rise to the surface when large groups of senior finance executives are asked about their biggest compliance anxieties, unique challenges facing their particular companies are the most pressing ones for individual finance chiefs.\n\nTypical is this comment from one survey respondent about the choices he was presented with: \u201cWe\u2019re in a specialized industry niche that has its own particular compliance requirements, which are of more concern than any of the above to us.\u201d (Respondents were asked to rank the following according to their chief compliance concerns for 2014: conflict minerals, antibribery laws, health care reform, accounting standards, tax rules and data security.)\n\nDepending on the industry, even the most widely known matters can have arcane, specialized compliance requirements. For example, the biggest compliance challenge that Mike Carruthers, CFO of Boulder, Colo.-based Array BioPharma, is facing in 2014 actually stems from a little-known section of the Affordable Care Act: The Physician Payments Sunshine Act.\n\nUnder the law, as of Aug. 1, 2013, drug makers, medical-device manufacturers and biopharmacology firms like Array that take part in U.S. federal health care programs are required to track and annually report payments made to doctors. Even though Array doesn\u2019t actually yet have a product on the market, the company, which is developing cancer-treatment drugs, got pulled into compliance with the law \u201cbecause of at least one collaboration we have with a much larger company that does have drugs on the market,\u201d says Carruthers.\n\n\u201cIt sounds simple on the surface, but it isn\u2019t,\u201d he continues. \u201cYou end up paying the entity that a physician may work for, and you don\u2019t have any idea how much the physician might get as a piece of that payment.\u201d Trying to overcome that is \u201ca big information-systems effort\u201d for Array involving indirect payments to at least 100 different doctors, says Carruthers.\n\nHe acknowledges that the Sunshine Act \u201cmay be a good idea because of all the things big pharma companies lavish on doctors to get them to prescribe their drug. That\u2019s a really bad thing, and we should know how much they\u2019re getting paid.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Congress should have considered the difficulties that much smaller companies could encounter under the act, says Carruthers. \u201cThe point is that there are unintended consequences,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "cfo outlook 2014, compliance, data security, features, health-care reform, issue 2013-12 cfo, law, premium, regulators, special report", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "author": "David M.
