The FBI described them as \u201csquatters\u201d \u2013 even though they stated from the outset that their intentions were very much political in nature.\n\nThe group was called the People Organized for Equal Rights. They set up camp much like the Occupy Wall Street movement later would.\n\nThe encampment was on a patch of land stolen by the federal government south of Savannah, back on April 30, 1979.\n\nThe group of prominent civil rights leaders, and other activists brought concrete blocks and bags of mortar to build new homes, but they were unarmed.\n\nThe Oregonian summarizes that \u201cfollowing the Civil War, a white plantation owner deeded the land on the Georgia coast to a former slave. In the decades that followed, the descendants of slaves moved to Harris Neck to build houses, factories and boats. They fished, hunted for oysters and grazed cattle.\u201d\n\nIn time, \u201cHarris Neck evolved into a thriving community. Its members were recognized as a culturally unique group of African Americans called Gullah.\u201d\n\nFinally, in 1942, the U.S. military told Harris Neck residents that they had only three weeks to vacate the land. They cited eminent domain laws, and ordered residents to leave their property so they \u201ccould construct an airbase for training pilots and conducting anti-submarine flights.\u201d\n\nAfrican American residents were given an insulting $26.90 per acre. Caucasian residents were given $37.31 fort the same amount of land.\n\n\u201cResidents were paid only for the unimproved value of their land, receiving nothing more for houses, barns, or crops in the field, all of which were bulldozed or burned,\u201d The New American reported in 2010.\n\nAfter World War II, the government held onto the land \u2013 never giving it back. They eventually turned it into the 2,762-acre Harris Neck National Wildlife Refuge.\n\nFederal law enforcement eventually got a court order to remove the Harris Neck protesters. They ignored their historical claims to the land, and after only a day of protests, they threatened to violently remove everyone if they did not leave of their own accord.\n\nEdgar Timmons, Jr., Hercules Anderson, Christopher McIntosh and the Rev. Ted Clark stayed and faced the threat head on.\n\nAccording to the Oregonian, on May 2, 1979, U.S. deputy marshals \u201cforcibly removed\u201d the men. \u201c\u2018Their bodies taut and motionless,\u2019 the men were dragged out of their tent, handcuffed and hoisted into a waiting van.\u201d\n\nThe men were all sentenced to jail, and two years later, in 1981, \u201ca fire destroyed county records with details on the original home sites.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think accounts for the difference between how both groups were treated when they took over federal wildlife sanctuaries? Is it racism? Or was the fact that the 1979 activists were unarmed the deciding factor law enforcement standing down?\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2016 \u2014 Counter Current News.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Harris Neck protesters were mostly displaced descendants of West African slaves.
