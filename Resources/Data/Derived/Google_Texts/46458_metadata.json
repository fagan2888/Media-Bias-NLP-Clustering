Is the company that built its fortunes on the Internet while threatening the brick-and-mortar store model recasting its business strategy? Or does Amazon have something more exciting and experimental up its sleeve? A day after Mathrani\u2019s comments, GGP clarified that his statements were \u201cnot intended to represent Amazon\u2019s plans,\u201d while Amazon declined to comment on \u201crumors and speculation.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, the ensuing debate on Amazon\u2019s future has centered on how the e-commerce giant could use technology and data analytics to create a new experiment with brick-and-mortar stores. Wharton management professor Daniel Raff said it was \u201cclear from industry gossip that [Amazon is] contemplating a rollout of stores\u201d and that there were \u201chints at clever new technology in these stores.\u201d However, \u201cthe bigger question is: Why they are thinking of [doing] it?\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Amazon Prime Is Such a Great Deal \u2013 for Amazon\n\nAccording to Amanda Nicholson, professor of retail practice at Syracuse University\u2019s Whitman School of Management, Amazon may be \u201ctrying to redesign a new kind of store and move into brick-and-mortar, utilizing its own technological and data brilliance.\u201d She noted that Amazon has an \u201cextraordinary supply chain\u201d and that it has \u201cbuilt [its] name on how to get stuff to us very inexpensively and very quickly.\u201d\n\nRaff and Nicholson discussed Amazon\u2019s possible expansion into the brick-and-mortar retailing world on the Knowledge@Wharton show on Wharton Business Radio on SiriusXM channel 111.\n\nMathrani\u2019s comments that kicked off the speculation about Amazon\u2019s strategy were unambiguous. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Amazon opening brick-and-mortar bookstores, and their goal is to open, as I understand, 300 to 400,\u201d he had said in GGP\u2019s earnings call on February 2, in response to an analyst\u2019s question about mall traffic, The Wall Street Journal reported. Before GGP clarified Mathrani\u2019s comments the following day, the share price of Amazon rival Barnes & Noble fell 9 percent.\n\nRaff pointed to Amazon\u2019s lone physical book store in Seattle to glean some insights into the company\u2019s thinking. He noted that the store occupies a tenth of the floor area of a former Barnes & Noble store at that location, and has a \u201chighly curated\u201d selection of books that seem to cater to \u201clocal interests\u201d such as those of campus walk-ins from the nearby University of Washington and suburban residents. \u201cAll books are displayed face-out unlike in other bookstores, and most significantly, they are sold at online prices,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything appears to be at a discount relative to what it would be at an ordinary bookstore.\u201d The store also sells Amazon\u2019s Kindle e-reader and its Fire Phone, he noted.\n\nRelated: Amazon plans to open up to 400 bookstores, says mall operator\n\nRaff drew two insights from that model. \u201cOne, it doesn\u2019t seem to be [about] just books, but also participation in the Amazon ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cThe other is, they are in a position to stock and promote these stores quite inexpensively. That is a competitive edge relative to new brick-and-mortar stores.\u201d\n\nRaff and Nicholson also noted that Amazon has filed several patent applications on its new material handling facilities and other innovations. One of those innovations \u201cinvolves recognizing who their customers are and their payment information while they are at the shelves and contemplating products, and allowing a cashier-less checkout,\u201d Raff said. If Amazon were to achieve all that, it could cut down significantly on its overhead and become more competitive in the brick-and-mortar market, added Nicholson.\n\nCost Savings, More Sales\n\nNicholson noted that Amazon is not trying to replicate a Barnes & Noble but attempting to do something different. Expanding on Raff\u2019s observation about the highly curated collection at Amazon\u2019s Seattle store, she said that space represents \u201ca test\u201d to see if Amazon can create \u201ca new kind of experience\u201d using data analytics about customers\u2019 preferences.\n\nRelated: Amazon renews credit card deal with JPMorgan\n\nHowever, \u201cwere [Amazon] able to give a coup de grace to Barnes & Noble, which has been appearing troubled in recent months,\u201d that would certainly benefit Amazon because there would be less pressure on pricing, Raff noted. Also, by adding brick-and-mortar \u201cdepots,\u201d Amazon could realize savings in its profit-draining cost structure of shipping to individual customers, he added. If Amazon could send large shipments to locations where customers could pick up their orders, the firm would be \u201cahead of the game in terms of shipping costs,\u201d he said. The company could also convert customer visits into sales of other merchandise.\n\nNicholson pointed out that online retail sales are still small at about 9% of all retail sales and that they could reach 12% by 2020. \u201cThere is still reason for people to go out and look at things and touch things,\u201d she said. \u201cOnline has not single-handedly destroyed people\u2019s need [to do so].\u201d\n\nFor the time being, Raff characterized any talk about an Amazon brick-and-mortar strategy as \u201chighly contingent speculation.\u201d Even if Amazon had such plans for physical stores, it would take a long time for them to be rolled out, he noted. Identifying the right locations, negotiating leases, fitting out the physical spaces, hiring and training staff and so on to open 400 stores in a short period of time would call for planning like that for \u201ca D-Day invasion,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the week leading up to the speculation about its future strategies, Amazon appeared to be in strong form. In its results announced on January 28, it posted 20% net sales growth for 2015 at $107 billion and net income of $596 million, reversing its net loss of $241 million in 2014.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Knowledge@Wharton.
