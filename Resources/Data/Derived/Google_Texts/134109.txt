Stand-alone health reimbursement arrangements (HRAs) have, in most cases, been a casualty of the Affordable Care Act—because they generally set limits on the maximum employer contribution, they typically can be found to violate the ACA’s ban on annual and lifetime coverage limits. The potential penalties are steep, and the rules for offering a compliant HRA are complex enough to dissuade many employers from making the effort.

However, for some small business clients, this popular method for reimbursing employer healthcare expenses may be making a comeback—recent legislation has been introduced that could allow certain small business clients to continue using the stand-alone HRA, thus reviving a popular and tax-preferred method for offering health coverage to employees.
