On Saturday CCI held it's signature fundraiser, Dog Fest Walk n' Roll in Panama City Beach for the first time.

For Breanna Hill everyday tasks like picking things up and opening doors were a constant struggle, until Stevie came along.

"He's changed my life because its given me a sense of independence pretty much to where I don't have to rely on mom and dad as much," said Breanna Hill, recipient of a canine companion

The 18-year-old has cerebral palsy and thanks to Canine Companions for Independence, four years ago she got her very own service dog.

"I am so awesomely grateful words cant express it," said Hill.

Dogs like Young are much more than pets, they're assistants, companions, and supporters.

"These dogs are trained to assist a person in specific needs that they have. We have service dogs, there are skilled companions, there are hearing dogs," said Chairman of the Dog Fest Walk n' Roll, Stephanie Cantrell.

CCI Is the largest organization that breeds and trains service dogs for people with disabilities, and Saturday, the first Dog Fest Walk n' Roll fundraiser was held in Panama City Beach.

"I am so excited I was even excited before I got out of bed this morning just knowing we were gonna raise so much money to change a lot more people and service members lives," said Hill.

The organization is made up entirely of volunteers. The dogs go through 18 weeks of training, and it isn't cheap, that's why fundraisers like this one are so important.

"It costs about 50,000 dollars to breed and raise and train one of these dogs and canine companions give these dogs to people free of charge," said Cantrell.

Organizers said their goal was to raise $30,000 but they did much better than that and raised $40,000.
