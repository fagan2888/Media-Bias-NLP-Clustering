Groundhog Day is approaching (it's Feb. 2 for you non-native Pennsylvanians) and to get in the spirit, one Democratic super PAC debuted a fun, rodent movie-themed graphic starring two of the left's least favorite Republicans.

[DEBATE CLUB: Should Congress Repeal the Affordable Care Act?]

Riffing off the "Groundhog Day" movie poster -- that's the Bill Murray movie where his day repeats over and over again -- the House Majority PAC cast House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., in lead roles.

"If you liked the GOP's obsession with Obamacare repeal votes in 2013, you're gonna love 2014," the online poster from the political action committee reads.

Additionally, the poster cites a CNN article from last week, which is headlined "GOP-led House will kick off 2014 like it spent most of 2013" and details Cantor's plan to start 2014 with an Obamacare security vote.

"Republicans already planned to make the midterm election a referendum on the President's signature health care law, so the vote ... will be the first among a string of Obamacare-related votes that will likely stretch into the fall," CNN's report said.
