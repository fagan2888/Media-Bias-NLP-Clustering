× Hamilton Health Center settles with feds in false claims suit

HARRISBURG, Pa. – Harrisburg based Hamilton Health Center, Inc. has agreed to pay the United States $270,000 to settle False Claims Act allegations. The settlement results from a self-disclosure of a violation by Hamilton Health to federal officials.



Federal law prohibits Medicare and Medicaid from paying for any item or service rendered by an individual excluded from participation in those programs. According to the self-disclosure and the investigation that followed, from 2006 to 2013, Hamilton allegedly employed an individual who had been previously excluded from participation in Medicare and Medicaid.

The federal government alleged that it had civil claims against Hamilton resulting from Medicare and Medicaid payments it received during that period of time that reimbursed the company for the excluded individual’s services. Hamilton has since taken corrective action and voluntarily disclosed the matter. The settlement resolves the matter without the filing of litigation.
