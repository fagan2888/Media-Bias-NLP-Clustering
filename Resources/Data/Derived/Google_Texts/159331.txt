The Islamic terror organization Boko Haram has abducted approximately one hundred men and boys and killed another 28 people this week in northeast Nigeria, local leaders and residents said Friday.

Boko Haram gunmen raided the fishing village of Doron Baga and surrounding villages of Lake Chad, about 110 miles north of the state capital, Maiduguri, burning homes along the way. The kidnappings took place Monday, but structural communication problems made it difficult to report until Friday.

The terror group became known on a mass scale when 276 girls were abducted from a boarding school in April, sparking the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. Although dozens have escaped, more than 200 girls are still missing and additional abductions have occurred since.

UPDATE, 8:44 p.m.: Troops from Chad have reportedly rescued 85 of the nearly 100 Nigerians abducted.
