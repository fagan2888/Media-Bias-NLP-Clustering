She also said his uncontrollable outbursts are a result of him not being able to speak and that he is subject to constant judgment wherever they go.\n\n\"The past few weeks have been very hard and trying for us - especially with public outings,\u201d Ashley told WBTV. \u201cRiley was getting loud and hitting the table and I know it was aggravating to some people.\"\n\nOne customer was undeterred by Riley\u2019s outbursts and was even touched by the parenting skills needed to care for a special needs child. The mystery diner decided to anonymously pay for the family\u2019s entire dinner. The good deed brought Ashley to tears.\n\n\"To have someone do that small act towards us shows that some people absolutely understand what we are going through and how hard it is to face the public sometimes,\" Ashley told WBTV. \"They made me cry, blessed me more than they know - I felt like out of all the rude negative comments that we are faced with - these outweighs them. The people who care!\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "riley england, free dinner, 8 year old, epilepsy, seizures, anonymous gift", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A family received a gift from an anonymous restaurant customer while enjoying dinner with their 8-year-old child with epilepsy.", "title": "Family Of 8-Year-Old With Epilepsy Receives Free Dinner From Anonymous Stranger", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/family-riley-england-8-year-old-epilepsy-receives-free-dinner-anonymous-stranger-255463", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/04/riley-england.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A family received a gift from an anonymous restaurant customer while enjoying dinner with their 8-year-old child with epilepsy.", "title": "Family Of 8-Year-Old With Epilepsy Receives Free Dinner From Anonymous Stranger", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/family-riley-england-8-year-old-epilepsy-receives-free-dinner-anonymous-stranger-255463", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/04/riley-england.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/04/riley-england.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-04T12:06:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-04T12:06:47-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A family received a gift from an anonymous restaurant customer while enjoying dinner with their 8-year-old child with epilepsy."}, "article_summary": "Ashley, Riley\u2019s mother, admits that her son became \u201ca little rowdy\u201d while they were sitting down for dinner.\n\"The past few weeks have been very hard and trying for us - especially with public outings,\u201d Ashley told WBTV.\nThe restaurant employee was carrying a note and told the England family, \"I'll try to do this without crying.\"\n\"To have someone do that small act towards us shows that some people absolutely understand what we are going through and how hard it is to face the public sometimes,\" Ashley told WBTV.\nShe explained that another customer decided to pay their bill and even left a note that read \u201cGod only gives special children to special people.\""}
