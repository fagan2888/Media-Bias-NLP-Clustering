A pre-taped sketch promised \u201ca new day\u201d for stoners living in the Big Apple. After hearing the news, they slowly came outside to see the light, and celebrate the legislative decision with a bong-toting Harrelson.\n\nAlso read: 'Shark Tank's' Daymond John Disappointed in 'SNL' ISIS Parody: It Was 'Insensitive'\n\nWhile it was great to see Harrelson clothed like a man his age still living in his mother\u2019s basement, the funniest sketch of the night came earlier when \u201cSNL\u201d skewered the television network\u2019s reaction to the barrage of complaints that viewers can easily issue through social media.\n\nThe fake commercial for fictional CBS sitcom \u201cThe Dudleys,\u201d a prototypical white family seen so many times throughout television history, revolved around the network advertising changes it made due to complaints received over Twitter.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 2014, why can\u2019t any of the Dudleys be gay?\u201d one tweet read.\n\nSee video: Megyn Kelly Reacts on 'SNL' Portrayal: Voice Needs to be Deeper, 'Something Else' Smaller\n\nPoof! Mrs. Dudley is instantly turned into Harrelson. But then he\u2019s too gay. And why can\u2019t his husband be black? Poof! \u201cSNL\u201d regular Keenan Thompson appears.\n\n\u201cHugging? Why can\u2019t a real couple show intimacy on TV?\u201d Cut to a graphic sex scene, and so on.\n\nThe riff on never-ending viewer unrest ended with a spectacular kicker when the network starts addressing paper letters, which are a hilarious nod to CBS\u2019 older demographic, who haven\u2019t quite mastered the internet.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to the whites?\u201d one letter reads. \u201cThese aren\u2019t my Dudleys,\u201d another reads. \u201cP.S. repeal Obamacare.\u201d\n\nSee video: Prince Rocks 'SNL' With Epic Eight-Minute Performance\n\nSome of you might have noticed Kim Kardashian\u2018s bare butt and breasts trying to \u201cbreak the internet\u201d this week, and you\u2019ll be happy to hear \u201cSNL\u201d writers addressed the trend quickly and cleverly.\n\nAfter pointing out the Paper magazine cover has been viewed by 16 million people, Weekend Update co-anchor Michael Che joked, \u201cThank you, Kim. I can now find porn just Googling the word \u2018paper.'\u201d\n\nHarrelson swung through the news segment to chime in on Season 2 of HBO hit \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d but Taran Killam stole the show as Matthew McConaughey, who was recently the subject of parody when Jim Carrey hosted.\n\nAlso read: Ratings: Chris Rock, Prince 'SNL' Scores Top Household Rating Since February\n\nThe topical episode also dedicated a sketch about the concussion controversy still surrounding football \u2014 a sport, in which tackling your opponent is an intricate component.\n\nHarrelson led the bit as a high school football coach teaching his players how to tackle other players to the ground safely. Or as Harrelson said, \u201cPut your princess to bed.\u201d The sketch seemed to favor America\u2019s most popular sport, until Thompson showed up as a former Pittsburgh Steeler who couldn\u2019t maintain a coherent stream of thought as he told the student athletes to hit hard on the field.\n\nOutside of current events, \u201cSNL\u201d hit a home run by parodying MTV\u2019s usually awful dating shows with \u201cMatch\u2019d\u201d \u2014 a game show featuring three horny guys gunning for the affection of a female contestant.\n\nSee video: Watch 'Today' Show's Top-Notch 'SNL' Halloween Homage\n\nThe twist? The host, played by Harrelson, is her father.\n\nThe confident and cocky contestants MTV viewers are used to sputtering off pre-written sexual puns on dating game shows like \u201cTaildaters\u201d and \u201cNext\u201d turn into fearful suck-ups trying to get the approval of the former Marine father, rather than impress his daughter.\n\nSaturday marked 25 years since Harrelson first took a stab at hosting \u201cSNL\u201d in 1989, and it appears he\u2019ll be welcome back with open arms when the next \u201cHunger Games\u201d movie hits theaters this time next year.\n\nWatch video from the episode above and below:", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Woody-Harrelson_Jennifer-Lawrence-SNL-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Greg Gilman", "description": "Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson all appeared to make fun of Harrelson for smoking too much pot on the NBC sketch show", "generator": "WooFramework 6.2.0", "og": {"site_name": "TheWrap", "description": "Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson all appeared to make fun of Harrelson for smoking too much pot on the NBC sketch show", "title": "'Hunger Games' Stars Join 'SNL' Host Woody Harrelson on Episode Tackling Football, CBS and Kim Kardashian (Video)", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 618, "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Woody-Harrelson_Jennifer-Lawrence-SNL.jpg", "height": 412}, "updated_time": "2014-11-16T13:36:01+00:00", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/hunger-games-stars-join-snl-host-woody-harrelson-on-episode-tackling-football-cbs-and-kim-kardashian/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jennifer Lawrence, Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson all appeared to make fun of Harrelson for smoking too much pot on the NBC sketch show", "creator": "@GregAtTheWrap", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/hunger-games-stars-join-snl-host-woody-harrelson-on-episode-tackling-football-cbs-and-kim-kardashian/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Woody-Harrelson_Jennifer-Lawrence-SNL-340x300.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Woody-Harrelson_Jennifer-Lawrence-SNL-340x300.jpg"}, "title": "\u2018Hunger Games\u2019 Stars Join \u2018SNL\u2019 Host Woody Harrelson on Episode Tackling Football, CBS and Kim Kardashian (Video)", "site": "@thewrap", "player": {"width": 640, "identifier": "//www.youtube.com/embed/oZRh6J9ezfw", "height": 400}, "card": "player"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-16T06:56:00+00:00", "sailthru.title": "\u2018Hunger Games\u2019 Stars Join \u2018SNL\u2019 Host Woody Harrelson on Episode Tackling Football, CBS and Kim Kardashian (Video)", "wp-parsely_version": "1.6", "fb": {"app_id": 228236404181023}, "google-site-verification": "-PpFSIrGHybVDxbndrL6MCngw3j6BXdy0xDVBVVOacI", "sailthru.tags": "nbc,snl,saturday night live,matthew mcconaughey,woody harrelson,next,liam hemsworth,josh hutcherson", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thewrap", "published_time": "2014-11-15T22:56:00+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/GregMFnGilman", "section": "TV", "modified_time": "2014-11-16T13:36:01+00:00", "tag": "Woody Harrelson"}, "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"\u2018Hunger Games\u2019 Stars Join \u2018SNL\u2019 Host Woody Harrelson on Episode Tackling Football, CBS and Kim Kardashian (Video)\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/hunger-games-stars-join-snl-host-woody-harrelson-on-episode-tackling-football-cbs-and-kim-kardashian\\/\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/11\\/Woody-Harrelson_Jennifer-Lawrence-SNL-150x150.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"376662\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-16T06:56:00Z\",\"section\":\"TV\",\"author\":\"Greg Gilman\",\"tags\":[\"hunger games\",\"jennifer lawrence\",\"josh hutcherson\",\"liam hemsworth\",\"matthew mcconaughey\",\"nbc\",\"next\",\"saturday night live\",\"snl\",\"the hunger games: mockingjay\",\"woody harrelson\"]}", "sailthru.category": "videos,tv", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Woody-Harrelson_Jennifer-Lawrence-SNL.jpg", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b19\"", "article_summary": "See video: Megyn Kelly Reacts on 'SNL' Portrayal: Voice Needs to be Deeper, 'Something Else' SmallerPoof!\nAfter hearing the news, they slowly came outside to see the light, and celebrate the legislative decision with a bong-toting Harrelson.\nSee video: Watch 'Today' Show's Top-Notch 'SNL' Halloween HomageThe twist?\nSee photos: 13 of 'SNL: Weekend Update' Anchors Before Newbie Colin Jost\u201cWe just know the stuff you told us about 1989,\u201d Hutcherson said.\nHarrelson led the bit as a high school football coach teaching his players how to tackle other players to the ground safely."}
