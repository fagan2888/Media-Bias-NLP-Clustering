Just like the shared rice-gruel remedies of the early twentieth century, we are now giving our cats, dogs, and canaries the same medications we take ourselves. A survey of prescription drug trends among 2.5 million insured Americans from 2001 to 2010, found that one in five adults is currently taking at least one psychiatric drug. Americans spent more than $16 billion on antipsychotics, $11 billion on antidepressants and $7 billion on drugs to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in 2010. And according to a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control, 87 percent of people who visit a psychiatrist\u2019s office leave with a prescription.\n\n*\n\nThe Prozac prescriptions for Anna Nicole Smith\u2019s Sugarpie, Jacques Chirac\u2019s Sumo, and most recently, Lena Dunham\u2019s rescue dog, Lamby, are indicative of a thriving marketplace for animal pharmaceuticals\u2014psychopharm and otherwise. The U.S. market for pet pharmaceuticals is large and growing, from $6.68 billion in 2011 to a projected $9.25 billion by 2015. Zoetis Inc. is the world\u2019s largest maker of animal medicines. Once a subsidiary of Pfizer, it went public in January of 2013 and raised $2.2 billion in its initial public offering, the largest IPO deal for an American company since Facebook. Elanco, a pet pharma company owned by Eli Lilly, has $1.4 billion in annual sales and is the fourth-largest animal health business in the world. Growth in Lilly\u2019s animal division recently outpaced its general pharmaceutical division for humans. Yearly sales of Pfizer\u2019s animal pharmaceuticals are worth roughly $3.9 billion, with companion animal meds representing 40 percent of the total.\n\nTotal sales of pet behavioral medications like fluoxetine are difficult to quantify because many pet owners buy their animals generic human versions from pharmacies like CVS or Walgreens. The Prozac, Valium, Xanax, and other drugstore sales for dogs, cats, and parrots are therefore lumped in with the sale of the same drugs for humans.\n\n*\n\nThe pet pharmaceutical industry is also touted as being recession-proof. Americans may even spend more on their pets during tough economic times. One market research firm recently claimed that people\u2019s love for their pets was an \u201cexcellent insulator against recessionary cutbacks.\u201d The same firm reported that many pet owners, both affluent and middle class, were less likely to limit spending on their animals than on their human family members during crises. This has proven to be true not only during the most recent economic downturns but also during the Great Depression, when, as the historian Susan Jones has suggested, families made great sacrifices in order to secure food for their pet dogs and cats.\n\nPsychopharmaceuticals are particularly profitable. The most lucrative human drugs in 2012, after cancer treatments, were antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and other mental health drugs. People spent more on psychopharmaceuticals than on drugs to treat pain, and the market has steadily increased, 10 to 20 percent per year globally, even during the most recent financial crisis. The markup on these drugs is more than several thousand percent, and as David Healy has argued, they\u2019re worth more than their weight in gold.\n\nThe scale of investment in the development and marketing of these psychotropic blockbuster drugs, for both humans and other animals, is tied to popular ideas about the illnesses they\u2019re used to treat. The industry that produces these drugs works hard to guarantee their financial success and this means encouraging more people to use them, for themselves and their pets. Two key historical decisions in particular helped ensure the current popularity of pharmaceutical use in the United States. The first took place in 1951, when the FDA (via the Humphrey-Durham amendments to the Food and Drug Act) declared that new medications would be available by prescription only. Before this, people largely medicated themselves, buying what they needed over the counter. Critics of the FDA\u2019s decision argued that it harmed regular citizens by making them completely beholden to a small group of people with the power to prescribe, who themselves were now dependent upon the pharmaceutical industry. A second FDA decision, in 1997, relaxed regulations limiting direct-to-consumer advertising and opened the floodgates to the pharmaceutical marketing machine that would quickly begin to publicize signs and symptoms of disorders that were easily treatable with compounds like the new Prozac.\n\nOne of the most vocal proponents of the use of psychopharmaceutical drugs for other animals is the veterinary behaviorist Nicholas Dodman, of the Tufts Animal Behavior Clinic. \u201cOne of the things that people called me was the Timothy Leary of the veterinary profession,\u201d Dodman said. Like Leary, Dodman acted as a sort of pied piper, drawing other veterinarians and pet owners to his methods via textbooks and peer-reviewed articles and workshops like \u201cThe Well-Adjusted Cat.\u201d\n\nDodman argues that studies he has overseen, some of which are supported by drug companies like Eli Lilly, prove that Prozac eases separation anxiety and compulsive disorders in animals and also reduces aggression and other \u201cproblem\u201d behaviors. He has published research on the use of antidepressants and psychotropic meds to treat everything from compulsive Doberman Pinschers and tail-chasing Terriers to corral-biting (or cribbing) horses and cats who pull out their fur.\n\nIn his book \u201cThe Well-Adjusted Dog, Dodman argues that psychopharmaceuticals treat a dog\u2019s problems \u201cfrom the inside out,\u201d though he believes that drugs are more successful if they are used in conjunction with behavior-modification training. The goal, he has said, should be to taper off the medication as soon as possible. In some cases, those in which withdrawing the meds causes the animal\u2019s anxiety, depression, fear, or aggression to return, he suggests an indefinite drug regime.\n\nDodman prescribes a wide variety of psychopharmaceuticals, as do the many vets who have incorporated his ideas into their own practices. He uses tricyclic antidepressants (Elavil and Tofranil) for depression, phobias, and in some cases of aggression in dogs. But he calls SSRIs like Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Celexa, Lexapro, and Luvox the closest thing there is to a silver bullet for treating behavioral problems in animals. He used to believe Valium was helpful for treating anxiety, but he\u2019s now convinced that, like alcohol, the drug can reduce inhibitions, and in dogs prone to aggression, this can make them vicious. It is also addictive. But Dodman still finds it useful for treating acute fear\u2014in cases like Oliver\u2019s thunderstorm panic.\n\nDodman didn\u2019t always work as a Merry Prankster to the dog legions. An Englishman, he spent the 1970s working as a roving country vet in the United Kingdom, a sort of contemporary James Herriot, the fictional alter ego of James Wight, the British veterinarian. Dodman moved to the United States in 1981 to be a professor of anesthesia at Tufts\u2019 veterinary school. There he began to wonder if psychotropic medicines could change veterinary practice in the same ways they were transforming human psychiatry. Dodman shared his ideas for the first time at a veterinary conference in the late 1980s and later told a journalist for the New York Times that \u201che saw jaws drop around the room. It was like, \u2018Who is this strange masked man?\u2019\u201d Thirty years later, largely through his many publicized success stories, the animal psychopharmaceutical industry is thriving in the United States.\n\nDodman remembers hearing the former dean of the Tufts vet school call Prozac the behavioral equivalent of the popular wide-spectrum deworming medication ivermectin. \u201cBefore ivermectin,\u201d he said, \u201cvets had to carefully choose which dewormer to use to treat intestinal and other worm infestations in dogs, cats, and farm animals. After ivermectin, vets could reach for this one medication to deal with practically all of these problems. All I can say is thank heavens for Prozac and other SSRIs.\n\nDodman\u2019s colleague Nicole Cottam says that 50 to 60 percent of the people who come to the Tufts clinic want drugs for their dog, cat, or bird. \u201cMost of our clients don\u2019t call or come back after the initial appointment. Unless it\u2019s to get refills. When people leave with a prescription and behavioral exercises, they tend to only use the pills.\u201d\n\nThe idea of a pill for pet problems is simply too seductive and, frankly, it\u2019s often useful. I know this from experience.\n\nOliver received his first Valium prescription after his jump, at the vet hospital. The second one came from his behaviorist. As I mentioned, we were supposed to give Oliver the Valium thirty minutes before a storm hit so that by the time the thunder and lightning descended he would be too blissed out to notice. We were also supposed to play him recorded sounds of thunder and rain. While we did this we were to pet him, but only when he reacted calmly. The duration of the faux-storm training was supposed to increase in single-minute increments until Oliver could listen to the CD peacefully for hours. The behaviorist also prescribed Prozac for his separation anxiety, telling us that it would take a few weeks to take effect and to let her know if there was any change in his behavior. We watched him, anxious now ourselves, but Oliver didn\u2019t seem to be happier or calmer.\n\nThe Valium, however, helped. It dulled his thunderstorm anxiety. The only problem was that Jude and I both worked outside of the house, and in D.C. summer thunderstorms tend to happen in the afternoon. Neither of us could return home thirty minutes before a storm hit in order to drug the dog. Five days a week Oliver was on his own when it came to afternoon weather anxiety. We tried playing the recorded sounds of storms to desensitize him, but the CD was less helpful than the drugs. Oliver simply wasn\u2019t bothered by the fake thunder. He endured the listening sessions with benign disinterest.\n\nThe behaviorist also suggested we use Valium to treat Oliver\u2019s separation anxiety, telling us to dose him thirty minutes before Jude and I left the house. And she urged us to retrain him around our leave-taking behavior.\n\nThe behavioral therapy or training process the vet outlined was supposed to start by Jude and I approaching the front door but not leaving, not even touching the knob. We were to do this repeatedly, until Oliver stopped acting anxious. The next stage was going up to the front door and touching the door knob. When this bored Oliver into not reacting, we were supposed to turn the handle and open the door but not walk through it. This was meant to happen in stages so that in the end, she promised us, we would be able to leave the house without Oliver caring at all. The problem was that this sort of training took weeks, if not months\u2014and we still had to go through the door in the meantime.\n\nWe tried to do the exercises. We gave it our best shot. Or to be honest, we gave it our best shot for a while. But it was exhausting, for us and for Oliver. He was so finely attuned to the various stages Jude and I had for getting ready to leave that as soon as we tried to decouple one cue from his \u201cthey are leaving me\u201d anxiety, picking up our keys, for example, Oliver would figure out another, such as making our lunches or putting on our work clothes. He may have been dysfunctional and disturbed, but he wasn\u2019t stupid.\n\nSometimes I stored my computer bag in our building\u2019s shared hallway because even the sight of it would make Oliver start vigilantly watching for our departure, panting heavily and pacing. He also reacted to the sight of suitcases. And the putting on of shoes. And the opening of the coat closet. Possibly, if Jude and I had left for work naked, through a window, with no lunches, no keys, no bags, no shoes, and at odd hours, we could have avoided triggering Oliver\u2019s anxiety.\n\nLike me, a lot of people simply can\u2019t spend the kind of time it takes to retrain themselves and their pet. Or it doesn\u2019t work. Sometimes, as with Oliver\u2019s Prozac, the drugs don\u2019t help either, or the effects aren\u2019t dramatic enough. This unfortunately tends to be the end of the line for most animals. They are given up or forced into what the veterinary behaviorist E\u2019lise Christensen calls \u201cthe big sleep\u201d and David Sedaris has referred to as visiting the \u201cYouth-in-Asia.\u201d Behavioral drugs, if they work, can help stave off such mortal consequences.\n\nDodman argues that most dogs and cats are taken to shelters or put down for \u201cbeing difficult.\u201d Indeed, 6 to 8 million dogs and cats are given up every year. According to the ASPCA, 3.7 million of them were euthanized in 2008. Aggressive and insecure dogs who menace visitors, or cats that won\u2019t stop spraying on the bedspread are the kinds of creatures most often left at shelters. Dodman argues that the great salvation of these ill-behaving dogs and cats is medication. Though I\u2019m doubtful that medication-only therapeutic regimes are as effective as behavior therapy or at least behavior therapy and medication, psychopharm for pets can be a useful way station on the road to recovery, or a stopgap measure on the way to the gas chamber.\n\nThe veterinary behaviorist E\u2019Lise Christensen is a proponent of psychopharmaceuticals because, she says, \u201cUnlike in human medicine, we don\u2019t have inpatient treatment facilities for our patients. If you have a dog that\u2019s jumping out windows into traffic, for example, you have to heavily dose them so they don\u2019t hurt themselves.\u201d\n\nHeavy doses for dogs are not quite the same as heavy doses for humans; dogs\u2019 livers can handle a lot more medication. This is why many dogs end up on dosages of antianxiety drugs that could kill a person. \u201cI have a golden retriever patient right now,\u201d Christensen said, \u201cthat\u2019s taking 80 milligrams of Valium every four hours.\u201d This would make a human limp, verging on catatonia, but it\u2019s keeping the retriever from full-blown panic attacks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "We spend billions on pet pharmaceuticals.
