Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.) wants people to refer to \u201cFreedom Against Internet Restrictions (FAIR)\u201d after a contest she launched on Reddit to develop a new name.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOf the more than 3,600 different entries and comments, FAIR was the top entrant, with 1,146 votes.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission\u2019s attempt to write new net neutrality regulations has sparked online outrage from critics who worry that a proposal from Chairman Tom Wheeler would allow companies to make deals with each other to speed up service, which could result in \u201cfast lanes\u201d for users of wealthy sites and \u201cslow lanes\u201d elsewhere.\n\nDespite the backlash, though, many still find the concept befuddling \u2014 a sentiment that comedian John Oliver memorably captured on his HBO show earlier this summer.\n\n\u201cInternet users know what they want and expect from the Internet, but these days all the jargon about net neutrality rules is making it difficult to know what box to check that advances their best interest,\u201d Eshoo, who is the top Democrat on the House Commerce subcommittee on technology, wrote when announcing the contest in August.\n\nIn addition to voting on names for new rules, many Reddit users also pushed the FCC to reclassify broadband Internet as a \u201ccommunications service\u201d instead of an \u201cinformation service,\u201d a controversial step that would allow the agency to impose utility-style regulations on Internet companies. Major industry leaders and Republicans have warned the FCC against taking that step, which would likely lead to a flurry of lawsuits.\n\nAccording to the National Journal, Eshoo declared support for a similar approach in an upcoming interview on C-SPAN.\n\nOther congressional leaders, such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and moderate Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), have urged the agency to impose utility-style rules.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Rep.
