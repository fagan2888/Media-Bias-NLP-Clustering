Whether it be pumpkin spice lattes, Wes Anderson, or not vaccinating your children, Stuff White People Like is usually not good for anyone else. But what if only white people like a certain civil right?\n\nA new poll of gay marriage support suggests that might be the case. Last week, YouGov polled nearly 1,000 online respondents and found that 48% of whites support \u201callowing gays and lesbians to marry legally\u201d, but only 31% who identify as black and 39% as Hispanic do. In fact, they found that a majority of blacks oppose gay marriage.\n\nWelp.\n\nBut is it really? And is it even true? (Hint: No, and probably not.) Let\u2019s find out!\n\nThe first red flag is the top-line number. This poll finds that only 45% of respondents support same-sex marriage. I say \u201conly\u201d because that\u2019s about 10-15% lower than almost every other poll conducted on the issue in the last few years. If the overall support response is that far off, the demographic breakdowns are probably a bit off too.\n\nAnd they definitely are. In an April 2014 poll showing 59% overall support for same-sex marriage rights (14% higher than the new poll), the internal race breakdown was all positive, showing 56% support among non-whites and Hispanics, not flipped like this poll.\n\nThe difference may be in the allowance for hesitation. In the YouGov poll, respondents were only allowed to favor, oppose, or be unsure. In the WaPo/ABC poll, there were options for \u201csomewhat\u201d and \u201cstrongly\u201d for both. This definitely affected the overall numbers. The former showed 14% total unsure, while the latter only 7% unsure. I would deduce that if it had allowed its respondents to \u201csomewhat favor\u201d, the YouGov poll would look very different, both in the overall support and support among minority groups that are typically supportive of civil rights issues.\n\nBut even if the poll did shake out, and it turned out that only white people support gay marriage, it shouldn\u2019t be an argument for conservatives to use against it. Marriage is either a right or not. Certain classes of people ought to be excluded from it or they shouldn\u2019t. The argument shouldn\u2019t rest on who else supports it. That kind of guilt by association collectivism is best saved for the left.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "poll,Racism,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "robots": "index,follow", "description": "- Usually when something becomes popular because mostly or exclusively white people enjoy it, the collective media/internet outrage machine works overtime to mock, discredit, and destroy that thing.
