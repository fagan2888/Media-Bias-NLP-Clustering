Too many never returned. So while NATO expansion is generally a good thing, it must never be free. Collective self-defense spelled out in Article 5 means all for one, one for all.\n\nConsidering NATO leaders recently agreed to accession talks with Montenegro as the 29th alliance member, we ought to ask the price.\n\nEven if few Americans ever heard of the tiny Balkan nation since it gained independence from Serbia in 2006, we\u2019ll now be obligated to defend it. Though it\u2019s not completely foreign \u2014 recognizable from the James Bond film \u201cCasino Royale\u201d \u2014 it is the Monte Carlo of Eastern Europe.\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem?\n\nWell, Montenegro, population 620,000 is notorious for easy money in real life too \u2014 particularly Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. Even though he\u2019s regularly accused of running a mafia state, he dismisses periodic mass protests as Moscow-inspired rabble rousing, orchestrated to keep the country out of NATO.\n\nSounds plausible, right?\n\nYet that theory falls apart considering all his pro-NATO critics. So before the dotted line is signed on Montenegro\u2019s admission, Americans should know more about the prime minister and his inner circle.\n\nSo here\u2019s a glimpse:\n\nMr. Djukanovic was implicated by Italy\u2019s anti-mafia commission for a cigarette-smuggling ring which laundered over $1 billion in profits, according to court documents from Italian and Swiss trials. The only reason the Italians didn\u2019t charge him directly is because of diplomatic immunity. After all, he is the head of state.\n\nMr. Djukanovic was also ensnared in a telecommunications bribery scheme involving his sister Ana Kolarevic, a high profile attorney, in which a Hungarian company, Magyar Telekom, acquired Montenegro\u2019s state-owned carrier. Since Magyar trades on the New York Stock Exchange, it along with parent company Deutsche Telekom of Germany, was forced by the U.S. Justice Department and Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pay almost $64 million in criminal penalties. As part of the settlement, Magyar admitted to paying about $9 million in bogus contracts to bribe \u201cat least two government officials\u201d as well as Ms. Kolarevic.\n\nEven more troubling, Dusko Jovanovic the editor in chief of the opposition newspaper, Dan, was gunned down outside his office in Montenegro\u2019s capital, Podgorica. Despite the family\u2019s lawyer asking the court to summon Mr. Djukanovic, that request was denied.\n\nBut wait, there\u2019s more.\n\nThe Balkans, including Montenegro, have become the major hub for arms trafficking in Europe. The natural result of ample weapon stockpiles leftover from the Yugoslav Army, lousy internal security and a thriving black market.\n\nNot surprisingly, those weapons are falling into the hands of radical Islam-inspired jihadists.\n\nAfter the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack in Paris last year, French authorities believed the Kalashnikov\u2019s came from the Balkans. Representing just a tiny fraction of the estimated 4,000 military-grade weapons smuggled from locales like Montenegro into France.\n\nOne Montenegrin citizen, 54-year old Vlatko V. was arrested in Germany headed to Paris with a rental car full of weapons and explosives just 8 days before November terror attacks. Coincidence?\n\nSo considering all the downsides about Montenegro, why in the world would NATO accept such a liability?\n\nBecause the alternative is worse.\n\nSince Croatia was admitted into NATO during 2009, Montenegro is now the only patch along the Adriatic Sea that isn\u2019t part of the alliance. With the aggressive Russian Bear on the prowl and trying to reconstitute an empire, Moscow would love it as another Kaliningrad. That\u2019s the small sliver of Russia on the Baltic Sea, wedged between Poland and the Baltic States, literally conquered and resettled by the Soviets after World War II. It\u2019s a vital military stronghold right in the middle of NATO\u2019s northern flank. Like Montenegro, Kaliningrad is also about the size of Connecticut.\n\nGiven Montenegro\u2019s strategic location and non-aligned status, from Vladimir Putin\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s ripe for the picking. And contrary to Moscow\u2019s claim that NATO expansion is a threat to Russia, it is Mr. Putin\u2019s regime that\u2019s guilty of invading, annexing and threatening neighbor countries \u2014 not the other way around.\n\nWhich is why NATO enlargement to include Balkan aspirants Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia makes sense. Ditto for Georgia across the Black Sea.\n\nYet admission into NATO cannot be a license to steal. Beyond meeting military standards, Washington and Brussels must insist aspiring countries adhere to Western democratic values \u2014 including commitments to government transparency, free speech, rule of law and anti-corruption measures.\n\nMr. Djukanovic must be sent a clear signal \u2014 NATO isn\u2019t a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card. Croatia\u2019s former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader received a 10-year jail sentence for bribery-related corruption not long after his country\u2019s admission.\n\nSo while Montenegro\u2019s admission to NATO should be a win/win, it must come with strings attached. Freedom isn\u2019t free.\n\n\u2022 J.D.
