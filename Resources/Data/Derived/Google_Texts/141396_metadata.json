However, it should certainly be acknowledged that support for the ACA has grown gradually since its implementation.\n\nThough a hypothetical single-payer healthcare program seems to be overtaking the ACA in terms of popularity, a significant development on its own, the way opinions break along partisan lines is perhaps the most interesting revelation from Gallup\u2019s poll.\n\nNearly three-quarters of all Democrats (and those who are Democrat-leaning) say they would like to see the ACA replaced with federal single-payer. Oddly, however, in response to a separate question, a slightly higher number of Democrats and leaners (79 percent) say they want the ACA to remain in place.\n\nRepublicans (and their leaners) are particularly surprising in their responses. Though four in five say they would like to see the ACA repealed, surprisingly, half of that group would support implementing single-payer healthcare in its place. Only 55 percent of Republicans say they would oppose that action.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to overstate the profundity of those figures \u2014 and their undeniable irony. As a political party, the Republicans have made concerted efforts to successfully derail single-payer healthcare at every turn since its proposal under the Clinton administration in the 1990s.\n\nWhen President Obama campaigned for it, he quickly met resistance and instead opted to push for what he likely viewed as a middle-ground solution in the form of Heritage Foundation-authored healthcare policy \u2014 the Affordable Care Act. Since the ACA was signed into law, Congressional Republicans have made ceaseless, futile efforts to have the ACA repealed.\n\nWhy are Republicans and Democrats alike looking to a federally organized single-payer healthcare system? The benefits of the ACA are undeniable. New figures show that 7.4 million Americans became insured between 2014 and 2015. Other studies have found that the number of Americans facing difficulties paying their medical bills have fallen from 22 percent to 17.3 percent since 2013.\n\nAs laudable as these figures are, the ACA still has significant blind spots. Last year 28.6 million Americans \u2014 almost one in 10 \u2014 were still uninsured. And that\u2019s not for trying. Many Americans in low-income jobs earn slightly too much to qualify under the ACA\u2019s expanded Medicaid programs and cannot reasonably afford insurance with out-of-reach deductibles, finding the fines a comparatively preferable alternative.\n\nOne of the core pieces of the Affordable Care Act \u2014 funding for subsidies paid to private insurers \u2014 is already at risk following a recent federal court ruling that determined the White House didn\u2019t have the authority to do this.\n\nThough Congressional Republicans are cheering this, the decision drives at the fundamental flaw of Obama\u2019s healthcare program: It mandates that most Americans purchase private insurance. One of the well-reported aspects of the ACA implementation was the expensive, poorly-designed website meant to pair Americans with a private insurer.\n\nThe ACA was largely inspired by policy drafted by the right-wing, pro-private sector think tank known as the Heritage Center \u2014 so it should come as no surprise that it promotes private business interests through government policy.\n\nThis is a very different approach to healthcare reform in the U.S. than a single-payer program that would, by its very nature, insure all Americans within a system that is not driven by profit (the factor that pushes for the unnecessarily inflation of medical costs).\n\nHow can the United States finally get a government-run, universal single-payer program? Despite the majority saying they would back such a policy, only one candidate in the race for president has made this proposal: Sen. Bernie Sanders. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said she\u2019d fight to keep the ACA as it is now, while presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump has said he\u2019ll repeal it and replace it (though with what, he has yet to specify).\n\nColorado, no stranger to experimental and progressive legislation, will have a proposal for statewide single-payer healthcare on ballots this November. If successful, it may prove that the most practical path to such reform in the U.S. may have to happen state by state, rather than on a federal level.\n\nPhoto Credit: monkeybusinessimages / Thinkstock", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even 40 percent of Republicans say they want the ACA replaced with a federal single-payer healthcare system.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3178/3177773.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "affordable care act,obamacare,healthcare,universal healthcare,single-payer health care,bernie sanders,hillary clinton,election 2016,colorado,health insurance", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Colorado, no stranger to experimental and progressive legislation, will have a proposal for statewide single-payer healthcare on ballots this November.\nAccording to Gallup, most Americans \u2014 58 percent \u2014 say they would prefer to see the Affordable Care Act replaced with a government-run health program that would insure all Americans.\nNearly three-quarters of all Democrats (and those who are Democrat-leaning) say they would like to see the ACA replaced with federal single-payer.\nHow can the United States finally get a government-run, universal single-payer program?\nWhy are Republicans and Democrats alike looking to a federally organized single-payer healthcare system?"}
