One of its creators, Joss Whedon, is hard at work on the sequel to \u201cThe Avengers\u201d; the show\u2019s being run day-to-day by Jed Whedon (Joss\u2019s brother) and Maurissa Tancharoen (Jed\u2019s wife).\n\nThor, Captain America, Iron Man and the rest of the Marvel superhero crew don\u2019t show up, at least in the pilot of the show; it\u2019s centered around Agent Coulson, the government liaison to the Avengers whose seeming death in the film catalyzed the superheroes\u2019 fight to save earth. He\u2019s back, and played by Clark Gregg, the television and film vet (of \u201cThe New Adventures of Old Christine\u201d and the upcoming film \u201cLabor Day,\u201d as well as four Marvel movies).\n\nGregg admitted some initial trepidation about resurrecting a character who\u2019d seemed to have died a hero\u2019s death onscreen. After all, Coulson\u2019s death was hardly a tossed-off moment \u2014 it was the emotional high point of the movie. And though hourlong action or sci-fi serials have had trouble sustaining themselves of late (from \u201cHeroes\u201d to \u201cTerra Nova,\u201d the list isn\u2019t short), Gregg was confident that the show would be swell, though he admitted \u201cI should really get scared about that, but I just can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHis castmate, Ming-Na Wen, made the case for \u201cS.H.I.E.L.D.\u2019s\u201d likely success yet clearer: \u201cThank God we have a healthy budget, which is really key \u2014 ABC is doing an amazing job in realizing, if you\u2019re going to provide a show with the expectations of a Marvel movie, they have to offer us the chance to put it onscreen.\u201d\n\nAnd Gregg provides a vital tie to the movies \u2014 movies whose stars, like Robert Downey Jr., Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Hemsworth, and Scarlett Johansson, are contractually tied to enough projects to make weekly appearances on a TV show unfeasible. Gregg is just about the only person from the Marvel universe who could make a TV show work, though Wen made clear the Marvel DNA will be evident throughout: \u201cPeople now know there are superheroes out there, there are aliens out there. That is part of [the show\u2019s] universe, as much as the Internet and iPhones are just part of our daily lives.\u201d\n\nMarvel has been the dominant force in big-budget cinema since the summer of 2008. That year, the grim, grave \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d outgrossed the fun, sunny \u201cIron Man\u201d \u2014 but \u201cIron Man\u2019s\u201d tone was the one that went on to be the house style of successful superhero movies. (\u201cMan of Steel,\u201d this year, aimed for the portentous tone of the Batman franchise, but seemed to miss that target slightly, underperforming \u201cIron Man 3\u2033 at the box office.) Now, with a family-friendly series, Marvel moves one degree further from the comic-book trade \u2014 and, they can only hope, towards conquering one more medium. Gregg, on whose shoulders the bet rests, spoke to Salon.\n\nI think a lot of people are dubious about the fact that your character in \u201cThe Avengers\u201d had died, and now you\u2019re back. Are you worried that people won\u2019t be able to go along for the ride with that?\n\nWhen you say go along for the ride, you mean like they won\u2019t buy it?\n\nRight.\n\nI was a little bit concerned about it, honestly. Even though, this was my very first call with Joss Whedon, when he called about doing this, was\u2014I thought that his sacrifice in \u201cThe Avengers\u201d was so important. It made \u201cThe Avengers\u201d work for me, as a fan of the comics and those movies, because it grounded it. You know, unless somebody you care about can be hurt, it\u2019s not really a war. And, you know it\u2019s hard to talk about, because I can\u2019t really talk about, you know, the story that\u2019s going to unfold about what I\u2019m still doing here.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t even know it all, part of the fabric of the story is\u2026the pilot is very clear that Phil Coulson believes he had a very close call, and that\u2019s just turned out be\u2026there turns out to be a lot more to the story than that, and it\u2019s a lot darker and a lot more complex, and you don\u2019t just come back from what he went through the same. And to me, that\u2019s got weight and that\u2019s the kind of comic book stuff I was always into, the stuff that had enough metaphorical or allegorical significance or weight.\n\nTo me, that was what hooked me. You know, I know Joss now. I know what really works for him, and know that when the stuff is just kind of like, fluffy and without darkness and kind of just like \u201cbang, boom, pow,\u201d it has no meaning for him, and it has no meaning for me either. So the movie starts to kind of talk about the rough form of its idea of what I was doing back there. It\u2019s sort of to connect themes of what it\u2019s like to come back from trauma, and how that lives in you, whether you really understand what you went through or not. And that journey, to me, you know, in a time when we have so many people coming home from war, or recovering from personal trauma in their lives\u2014all of a sudden it felt grounded and it meant something to me. So, then to have it also have all the fun stuff, and the great sense of humor that Joss brought to \u201cThe Avengers\u201d \u2014 once I knew those things, that was the package, I was no longer concerned about \u201cThe Avengers,\u201d because I thought if anything, this was going to enhance what happened in \u201cThe Avengers,\u201d if I can say that.\n\n\u201cThe Avengers\u201d is based upon the Marvel comic b0ok canon, and the television show is based upon \u201cThe Avengers.\u201d How many degrees removed is too many \u2014 or is the universe expansive enough to handle endless additions?\n\nBecause I got involved at \u201cIron Man,\u201d and I\u2019ve kind of watched the way they\u2019ve unfolded the movie universe, and for someone who actually likes comics, I believe that\u2019s the way they did it because on the one hand it\u2019s really faithful, super faithful, to the comic book fans, but clear they\u2019re trying to basically film a comic book. They\u2019re making them into movies and fully adapting them for that medium. And they found a way, they did it so shrewdly, by starting with Tony Stark, whose technology is just a few steps away from what we already have. And once they kind of landed that, then they moved to the much more ambitious world of Asgard [in \u201cThor\u201d]. And I thought, oh my god, I know how they pulled off the guy in the iron suit, or the billionaire philanthropist, but how the hell are they going to pull off the long-haired guy with the hammer from Norse mythology. But step by step they kind of stood out, and were true to each specific character and comic book\u2019s own world. Once they built the fabric of the story, it sort of felt like chapters of this epic novel, and now, to me, the idea that they\u2019re going to expand into the television weekly serial part of the genre makes perfect sense, because that\u2019s what \u201cS.H.I.E.L.D.\u201d feels like.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D\" star on following up \"The Avengers\" on TV, and the staying power of superheroes", "title": "Clark Gregg: \u201cMarvel has a way of respecting their audience, not just the nerds\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D\" star on following up \"The Avengers\" on TV, and the staying power of superheroes", "title": "Clark Gregg: \u201cMarvel has a way of respecting their audience, not just the nerds\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/21/clark_gregg_marvel_has_a_way_of_respecting_their_audience_not_just_the_nerds/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/clark_gregg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D\" star on following up \"The Avengers\" on TV, and the staying power of superheroes", "title": "Clark Gregg: \u201cMarvel has a way of respecting their audience, not just the nerds\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/clark_gregg.jpg", "creator": "@dpd_", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Clark Gregg, marvel's agents of shield, ming-na wen", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd0c\"", "article_summary": "He\u2019s back, and played by Clark Gregg, the television and film vet (of \u201cThe New Adventures of Old Christine\u201d and the upcoming film \u201cLabor Day,\u201d as well as four Marvel movies).\n(\u201cMan of Steel,\u201d this year, aimed for the portentous tone of the Batman franchise, but seemed to miss that target slightly, underperforming \u201cIron Man 3\u2033 at the box office.)\nGregg admitted some initial trepidation about resurrecting a character who\u2019d seemed to have died a hero\u2019s death onscreen.\nThat year, the grim, grave \u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d outgrossed the fun, sunny \u201cIron Man\u201d \u2014 but \u201cIron Man\u2019s\u201d tone was the one that went on to be the house style of successful superhero movies.\nAnd once they kind of landed that, then they moved to the much more ambitious world of Asgard [in \u201cThor\u201d]."}
