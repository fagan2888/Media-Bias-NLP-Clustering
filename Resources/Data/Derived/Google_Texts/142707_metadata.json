There will be cynics who say it can not be done. Long before the details of this clean energy plan were even decided, the special interests and their allies in Congress were already mobilizing to oppose it with everything they got.\n\nThey will claim that this plan will cost you money. Even though this plan the analysis shows long-term will save the average American eighty-five dollars a month on their energy bills.\n\nThey\u2019ll claim that we need to slash our investments in clean energy. It\u2019s a waste of money. Even though, they are happy to spend billions of dollars a year in subsidizing oil companies.\n\nThey\u2019ll claim this plan will kill jobs. Even though our transition to a cleaner energy economy has the solar industry to just name one example creating jobs ten times faster than the rest of the economy.\n\nThey\u2019ll claim this plan is a war on coal to scare up votes. Even as they ignore my plan to actually invest in revitalizing coal country and supporting healthcare and retirement for coal miners and their families and retraining those workers for better-paying jobs and healthier jobs.\n\nCommunities across America have been losing coal jobs for decades. I want to work with Congress to help them, not to use them as a political football.\n\nPartisan press releases aren\u2019t going to help those families.\n\nEven more cynical, we\u2019ve got critics of this plan who actually claiming that this will harm minority and low-income communities. Even though climate change hurts those Americans the most, who are the most vulnerable.\n\nToday an African-American child is more than twice as likely to be hospitalized from asthma. A Latino child is forty percent more likely to die from asthma.\n\nSo if you care about low-income minority communities start protecting the air that they breathe and stop trying to rob them of their healthcare.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama isn\u2019t waiting for Republicans and their Koch masters to get their attack machine into high gear. The criticisms that are certain to come to the surface have been floating around conservative media for months. The Koch brothers have been using their vast organizational network to spread misinformation, and right-wing blogs and websites have quickly jumped on board.\n\nThe reality is that Republicans are opposed to clean air and human beings having a healthy environment to live in. Obama was correct. There is no \u201cwar on coal.\u201d Coal jobs have been declining for decades due in large part to the rise of the natural gas industry.\n\nThe tactics that Republicans and their allies are utilizing should seem familiar because this is the same strategy that they have used in their attempts to destroy Obamacare. Republicans want to scare people away from a plan that will help them through a barrage of lies and misinformation.\n\nPresident Obama is ready to beat them at their own game by derailing the misinformation express before it has a chance to get rolling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama is wise to Republican tactics which was why he preemptively destroyed their lies and misinformation about his clean energy plan during his speech today.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "President Obama is wise to Republican tactics which was why he preemptively destroyed their lies and misinformation about his clean energy plan during his speech today.", "title": "President Obama Obliterates Republican Lies With A Clean Energy Plan Fact Bomb", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/08/03/president-obama-obliterates-republican-lies-clean-energy-plan-fact-bomb.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/obama-clean-energy-plan-2.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-08-03T15:13:32+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-08-03T15:13:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-03T15:13:32+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5f86\"", "article_summary": "President Obama is wise to Republican tactics which was why he preemptively destroyed their lies and misinformation about his clean energy plan during his speech today.\nThere is no \u201cwar on coal.\u201d Coal jobs have been declining for decades due in large part to the rise of the natural gas industry.\nLong before the details of this clean energy plan were even decided, the special interests and their allies in Congress were already mobilizing to oppose it with everything they got.\nDuring his speech announcing his clean power plant plan, President Obama said:There will be critics of what we\u2019re trying to do.\nThey\u2019ll claim that we need to slash our investments in clean energy."}
