Lisa Fosnight entered Butler University knowing she wanted to study business.

She didn’t expect to fall in love with accounting.

Fosnight credits a Butler professor, Sakthi Mahenthiran, for sparking her interest in the field.

“He made the material understandable, and I truly enjoyed accounting. I felt like accounting fit with me and really clicked,” she said.

Fosnight joined Indianapolis-based London Witte & Co. in 2001, and now serves as a manager and certified public accountant at the firm.

The 2012 Hoosier Hot 50 Jobs rankings, compiled by the Indiana Department of Workforce Development, places accounting professions at No. 26 for growth careers.

The state agency expects the profession to grow in Indiana by more than 240 jobs each year. Fosnight thinks that number could rise slightly as new tax laws and regulations are passed by lawmakers.

“They keep adding complexities that most people cannot understand. For example, the Affordable Care Act will be monitored through tax returns,” she said.

Question: Why did you want to make this your career?

Answer: I knew going into college that I wanted to do business. I had my high school gym teacher, who was a Butler grad, tell me that his friends with business degrees were guaranteed a job when they completed school. This sounded good to me. I was drawn to accounting, because I had a teacher who made me like it. I am good at math, detail-oriented and a problem solver. These are all traits that an accountant needs to possess.

Q: How do you expect your profession to change over/evolve the next 10 years?

A: With advancements in technology, I see there being quite a few changes in how we interact with clients and do work within our offices. More and more people are using cloud computing, which creates paperless files. We will continue to prepare and provide financial statements and tax returns — electronically. I also expect some changes in how businesses report items. Financial statements will look different with some of the items currently being discussed. I also think that additional legislation being made in Washington (D.C.) will give my profession job security.

Q: How have things changed since your career began?

A: Things have changed a lot since I first started. For instance, tax returns were still filed on paper, not electronically. ... We do not currently prepare as many financial statements nor are we preparing any audited financial statements. ... Our client base was mostly here in Central Indiana when I first started. Currently we have clients all over the country. Technology has provided us the opportunity to work with clients we were not able to before.

Q: What would surprise people the most about your industry?

A: CPAs are not boring. We can be fun people and the work is fun as well. You get to meet variety of people in a variety of industries.

Q: What advice do you have for someone aspiring to be an accountant?

A: I would tell someone that they need to take the CPA exam as soon as they complete college. The test is not easy. The sooner a person can study and pass the test, the better.
