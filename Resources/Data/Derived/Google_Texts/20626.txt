Even as the region fares better than a few years ago, Harbert continues to hear lingering concerns about the economy, including the U.S. unemployment rate. As the new year dawns, he says plenty of questions remain about the economy, how it will affect business decisions, and what will happen in Washington, D.C.

“There remains a high level of uncertainty as to the economy, which may also be a reflection of the issues that remain front and center. Businesses and consumers react better when they know what to expect in the near future. The Affordable Care Act, the debt ceiling debates, tax policies, government regulations and many other issues create concerns for businesses and individuals.

"Those concerns may limit their borrowing or spending for new business equipment, (and) building and business expansions, all of which may impact future job growth. … Individuals may also tighten up their personal budgets because they are not sure what the future holds for them and their families.”
