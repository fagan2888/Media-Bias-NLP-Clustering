On the heels of a blowout win over arch-rival Clemson last month, the Gamecocks have now won arguably their biggest game of the Martin era \u2013 and their first win over a Top Ten opponent since beating No. 1 Kentucky five years ago.\n\nSouth Carolina upended No. 9 Iowa State 64-60 on Saturday night at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York \u2013 upsetting a program that reached the Sweet Sixteen last year before losing to eventual national champion Connecticut.\n\nThe Gamecocks (9-3, 0-0 SEC) held the Cyclones (10-2, 0-0 Big 12) to their lowest point total in nearly a year \u2013 limiting one of the nation\u2019s hottest shooting teams to only 25.9 percent from the floor during the second half. Iowa State also made just one of eighteen three-point field goals it attempted against South Carolina\u2019s stingy defense.\n\nOffensively, sophomore guard Duane Notice paced the Gamecocks with fifteen points \u2013 but it was the clutch play of slumping star Sindarius Thornwell that propelled South Carolina across the finish line against the Cyclones.\n\nWith the Gamecocks clinging to a two-point lead, Thornwell converted an old-fashioned three-point play with less than two minutes on the clock to put South Carolina up 61-56. Moments later the Lancaster, S.C. native hit another clutch layup as the shot clock was expiring \u2013 putting the Gamecocks ahead 63-57.\n\nThe exclamation point? A steal and converted free throw as Iowa State was attempting to tie the game on its next-to-last possession \u2013 icing the win for the Gamecocks.\n\nThornwell finished with thirteen points. He also held Cyclones\u2019 senior guard Bryce Dejean-Jones \u2013 who entered the game averaging more than 15 points per contest \u2013 to only three points.\n\n\u201cHe just needs the confidence to see that ball go through that basket,\u201d Martin said after the game. \u201cMaking some of those shots down the stretch hopefully engages him offensively a little more.\u201d\n\nIndeed \u2026\n\nThornwell is heating up at just the right time. South Carolina \u2013 which is riding a seven-game winning streak \u2013 opens its conference slate this Wednesday (January 7) against the Florida Gators.\n\nAnd yes, it\u2019s safe to say Martin\u2019s program has come a long way in the ten months since the Gators\u2019 last visit to Colonial Life Arena.\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA-IOWA STATE BOX SCORE (.pdf)\n\nPic: Travis Bell Photography\n\n***", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2015/01/03/another-big-win-frank-martin/", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/12.1914.frank_.martin.1-600x370.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Another Big Win For Frank Martin"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e1d\"", "article_summary": "South Carolina \u2013 which is riding a seven-game winning streak \u2013 opens its conference slate this Wednesday (January 7) against the Florida Gators.\nSouth Carolina upended No.\nOn the heels of a blowout win over arch-rival Clemson last month, the Gamecocks have now won arguably their biggest game of the Martin era \u2013 and their first win over a Top Ten opponent since beating No.\nA steal and converted free throw as Iowa State was attempting to tie the game on its next-to-last possession \u2013 icing the win for the Gamecocks.\n\u201cHe just needs the confidence to see that ball go through that basket,\u201d Martin said after the game."}
