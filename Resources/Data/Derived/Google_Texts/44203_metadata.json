But a regional manager for CMS acknowledged the problem at the same New Hampshire meeting and said the agency is working on it, as did Proulx in a later interview.\n\n\u201cThis is an important issue, and we\u2019re not taking it lightly,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if this impacts only one family \u2026 it\u2019s a big deal and we want to get it resolved as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nThe federal government sets minimum guidelines for Medicaid eligibility, but states can choose to expand coverage beyond that. In some states, parents must have significantly lower incomes to gain Medicaid coverage for themselves than they would to get coverage for just their children, either through Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program \u2014 also known as CHIP \u2014 the low-income health insurance program for children who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid.\n\nIn North Port, Fla., Russell Clouden was thrilled to find a better, cheaper family plan through the new marketplace, then stunned to realize his 14-year-old daughter wouldn\u2019t be enrolled because she might qualify for Florida Healthy Kids, the state\u2019s version of CHIP. The federal government still hasn\u2019t transferred roughly 90,000 Medicaid files over to Florida officials, including Clouden\u2019s daughter\u2019s, so she still doesn\u2019t have insurance.\n\n\u201cBased on your income, they\u2019ll separate your kids from your primary policy and they shift them off to Medicaid or Healthy Kids and there\u2019s no way you can bring them back,\u201d said Clouden, whose daughter is an accomplished equestrian jumper.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of in limbo with her because I\u2019m just hoping she doesn\u2019t get injured or sick,\u201d said Clouden, 53, who runs a restaurant franchise. \u201cWithout insurance, you\u2019ve kind of got a knot in your stomach watching her jumping.\u201d\n\nInsurance broker Matthew Dinkel in Fort Myers, Fla., said he has about 15 clients in Clouden\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cI have worried parents literally calling and texting me every day asking for an update,\u201d said Dinkel. \u201cThey canceled their old plans that covered their entire family and now they have coverage but their kids don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nJessica Waltman of the National Association of Health Underwriters said her group has raised the problem, and others, with federal officials and asked for a dedicated hotline or email address for insurance brokers to get answers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nationwide issue that we\u2019ve heard time and again, and it could have very significant coverage issues for families,\u201d she said.\n\nMarc Jobin, a construction consultant in southern New Hampshire, said the process has been so confusing, he\u2019s put off a decision for himself, his wife and their two children, even though he\u2019s seen premiums that are significantly lower than what they pay now.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been hesitating for two months now because the information is not clear,\u201d he said. \u201cAround the holidays, we were thinking, \u2018let\u2019s do this, let\u2019s sign up,\u2019 and then the latest problem is now our children will probably be thrown into the state health care system, but nobody knows what that means.\u201d\n\nMary Ann Cooney, associate commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, urged those awaiting Medicaid decisions to call their state offices directly. She said her office has been getting incomplete application information from the federal government, making it harder to contact people to determine their Medicaid eligibility, but situations are improving and the office is reaching out to hundreds of people each day.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d she said.\n\nBut in the meantime, children are going without coverage. In California, Robert Clark said when he applied by phone through the Covered California marketplace, he was assured that his two children would be on the plan he picked. But he later got separate notices from the insurance company and Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nHe called Covered California again and was told the person he\u2019d previously talked to there was wrong and that his children had to be enrolled in Medi-Cal. Clark, the president of a Menlo Park technology company, doesn\u2019t like that prospect because the doctors his children have seen since their births don\u2019t take Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty frustrating,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve probably spent several days\u2019 worth of time on hold.\u201d\n\nInstead, he\u2019s exploring whether he can enroll his children in individual, unsubsidized plans through Covered California. He recently found out his original application was \u201chung up,\u201d so he plans to resubmit a fresh application, but in the meantime has lost out on coverage for January.\n\n\u201cMy daughter is in gymnastics,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she falls on her head, we need to be covered.\u201d\n\nYou May Also Be Interested In\n\n\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2014 The Associated Press.
