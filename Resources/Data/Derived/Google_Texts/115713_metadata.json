But 32% said they use such investigations to identify opportunities to create value and improve performance.\n\n\u201cAs investors become increasingly focused on GPs\u2019 [general partner\u2019s] ability to add value to their investee companies, it is becoming increasingly clear that far from merely looking for problems, reputation-focused due diligence is now also being used as a critical strategic tool to identify operational improvement and value creation opportunities within potential portfolio companies,\u201d said Violet Ho, senior managing director of Kroll.\n\nAudit Insecurity: In a survey of 450 senior IT decision makers on IT security challenges, by consulting firm Ovum Ltd. and business technology firm Axway, 23% of respondents said their company failed a security audit in the last three years, and 17% didn\u2019t believe or didn\u2019t know if they would pass a compliance audit today.\n\nMid-Sized Miscalculations: One in three mid-sized businesses surveyed by employment services management firm ADP said they have faced fines for noncompliance and are vastly underestimating the time and money it takes to comply with new government regulations.\n\nEmbracing Risk: Executives who fail to spot and prepare for strategic risks can be the reason a company\u2019s market position is destroyed or upended by new disruptive technologies, according to a report from Deloitte & Touche LLP, which sponsors the Risk & Compliance Journal page.\n\nRegulatory Impacts: In a survey of 56 women general counsels who attended a leadership summit by law firm DLA Piper, 89% of respondents said the recent uptick in regulatory activity has affected their company and/or industry.\n\nAt Your Own Risk: In a survey by consulting firm Protiviti and St. John\u2019s University of more than 100 U.S. insurance industry executives about pending changes to the Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA) requirements, 51% percent of respondents said heightened regulatory scrutiny associated with ORSA could affect the nature and types of insurance products sold.\n\nRegulation Overload: The latest indicator survey from Wolters Kluwer Financial Services shows a nearly a 30% jump since January 2013 in concern expressed by nearly 400 U.S. banks and credit unions over increasing regulatory requirements and risk-management challenges.\n\nDodd-Frank Impact: A survey of boutique money managers by software and IT services company SunGard Financial Systems and financial markets research firm Tabb Group found 42% saying regulations are the greatest obstacle to their success, up from 17% who said that in 2013.\n\nSupply and Comply: Amid increasing regulation and consumer demand for companies to achieve sustainable global supply chains, consulting firm ACE Group\u2019s ESIS division released a report on ways electronics organizations can ensure compliance with the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition Code of Conduct.\n\nBurden Growing: There were 82 new regulatory changes that impact community banks added in the third quarter, according to compliance management firm Continuity Control\u2019s quarterly Banking Compliance Index.\n\nFeeling Crabby: Crab stocks in the Russian Far East are at risk of collapse due to overharvest from rampant illegal fishing, with much of the catch entering into the U.S., a World Wildlife Fund report found.\n\nWrite to Ben DiPietro at ben.dipietro@dowjones.com, and follow him on Twitter @BenDiPietro1.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "One-third of the private equity investors surveyed said they use reputation due diligence to identify opportunities to create value and improve performance.", "title": "Survey Roundup: Using Reputation Due Diligence to Spot Opportunities", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2014/10/17/survey-roundup-using-reputation-due-diligence-to-uncover-opportunities/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "Survey Roundup: Using Reputation Due Diligence to Spot Opportunities", "description": "One-third of the private equity investors surveyed said they use reputation due diligence to identify opportunities to create value and improve performance.", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Ben DiPietro", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Risk & Compliance Journal.
