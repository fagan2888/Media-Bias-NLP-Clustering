Last year, Paul R. LePage, the fiercely anti-welfare Republican governor of Maine, was re-elected despite a highly erratic first term \u2014 with strong support in struggling towns where many rely on public assistance. And earlier this month, Kentucky elected as governor a conservative Republican who had vowed to largely undo the Medicaid expansion that had given the state the country\u2019s largest decrease in the uninsured under Obamacare, with roughly one in 10 residents gaining coverage.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to give Democrats the willies as they contemplate a map where the red keeps seeping outward, confining them to ever narrower redoubts of blue. The temptation for coastal liberals is to shake their heads over those godforsaken white-working-class provincials who are voting against their own interests.\n\nBut this reaction misses the complexity of the political dynamic that\u2019s taken hold in these parts of the country. It misdiagnoses the Democratic Party\u2019s growing conundrum with working-class white voters. And it also keeps us from fully grasping what\u2019s going on in communities where conditions have deteriorated to the point where researchers have detected alarming trends in their mortality rates.\n\nIn eastern Kentucky and other former Democratic bastions that have swung Republican in the past several decades, the people who most rely on the safety-net programs secured by Democrats are, by and large, not voting against their own interests by electing Republicans. Rather, they are not voting, period. They have, as voting data, surveys and my own reporting suggest, become profoundly disconnected from the political process.\n\nThe people in these communities who are voting Republican in larger proportions are those who are a notch or two up the economic ladder \u2014 the sheriff\u2019s deputy, the teacher, the highway worker, the motel clerk, the gas station owner and the coal miner. And their growing allegiance to the Republicans is, in part, a reaction against what they perceive, among those below them on the economic ladder, as a growing dependency on the safety net, the most visible manifestation of downward mobility in their declining towns.\n\nThese are voters like Pamela Dougherty, a 43-year-old nurse I encountered at a restaurant across from a Walmart in Marshalltown, Iowa, where she\u2019d come to hear Rick Santorum, the conservative former Pennsylvania senator with a working-class pitch, just before the 2012 Iowa caucuses. In a lengthy conversation, Dougherty talked candidly about how she had benefited from government support. After having her first child as a teenager, marrying young and divorcing, Dougherty had faced bleak prospects. But she had gotten safety-net support \u2014 most crucially, taxpayer-funded tuition breaks to attend community college, where she\u2019d earned her nursing degree.\n\nShe landed a steady job at a nearby dialysis center and remarried. But this didn\u2019t make her a lasting supporter of safety-net programs like those that helped her. Instead, Dougherty had become a staunch opponent of them. She was reacting, she said, against the sense of entitlement she saw on display at the dialysis center. The federal government has for years covered kidney dialysis treatment in outpatient centers through Medicare, regardless of patients\u2019 age, partly on the logic that treatment allows people with kidney disease to remain productive. But, Dougherty said, only a small fraction of the 54 people getting dialysis at her center had regular jobs.\n\n\u201cPeople waltz in when they want to,\u201d she said, explaining that, in her opinion, there was too little asked of patients. There was nothing that said \u201c\u2018You\u2019re getting a great benefit here, why not put in a little bit yourself.\u2019\u201d At least when she got her tuition help, she said, she had to keep up her grades. \u201cWhen you\u2019re getting assistance, there should be hoops to jump through so that you\u2019re paying a price for your behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\n\nYes, citizens like Dougherty are at one level voting against their own economic self-interest, to the extent that the Republican approach on taxes is slanted more to the wealthy than that of the Democrats. This was the thesis of Thomas Frank\u2019s 2004 best seller, \u201cWhat\u2019s the Matter With Kansas,\u201d which argued that these voters had been distracted by social issues like guns and abortion. But on another level, these voters are consciously opting against a Democratic economic agenda that they see as bad for them and good for other people \u2014 specifically, those undeserving benefit-recipients in their midst.\n\nI\u2019ve heard variations on this theme all over the country: people railing against the guy across the street who is collecting disability payments but is well enough to go fishing, the families using their food assistance to indulge in steaks. In Pineville, W.Va., in the state\u2019s deeply depressed southern end, I watched in 2013 as a discussion with Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat, quickly turned from gun control to the area\u2019s reliance on government benefits, its high rate of opiate addiction, and whether people on assistance should be tested for drugs. Playing to the room, Senator Manchin declared, \u201cIf you\u2019re on a public check, you should be subjected to a random check.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s much the same across the border in eastern Kentucky, which, like southern West Virginia, has been devastated by the collapse of the area\u2019s coal industry. Eastern Kentucky now shows up on maps as the most benefit-dependent region in the country. The welfare reforms of the 1990s have made cash assistance hard to come by, but food-stamp use in the state rose to more than 18 percent of households in 2012 from under 10 percent in 2001.\n\nWith reliance on government benefits so prevalent, it creates constant moments of friction, on very intimate terms, said Jim Cauley, a Democratic political consultant from Pike County, a former Democratic bastion in eastern Kentucky that has flipped Republican in the past decade. \u201cThere are a lot of people on the draw,\u201d he said. Where opposition to the social safety net has long been fed by the specter of undeserving inner-city African-Americans \u2014 think of Ronald Reagan\u2019s notorious \u201cwelfare queen\u201d \u2014 in places like Pike County it\u2019s fueled, more and more, by people\u2019s resentment over rising dependency they see among their own neighbors, even their own families. \u201cIt\u2019s Cousin Bobby \u2014 \u2018he\u2019s on Oxy and he\u2019s on the draw and we\u2019re paying for him,\u2019 \u201d Cauley said. \u201cIf you need help, no one begrudges you taking the program \u2014 they\u2019re good-hearted people. It\u2019s when you\u2019re able-bodied and making choices not to be able-bodied.\u201d The political upshot is plain, Cauley added. \u201cIt\u2019s not the people on the draw that\u2019s voting against\u201d the Democrats, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s everyone else.\u201d\n\nThis month, Pike County went 55 percent for the Republican candidate for governor, Matt Bevin. That\u2019s the opposite of how the county voted a dozen years ago. In that election, Kentucky still sent a Republican to the governor\u2019s mansion \u2014 but Pike County went for the Democratic candidate. And 30 percent fewer people voted in the county this month than did in 2003 \u2014 11,223 voters in a county of 63,000, far below the county\u2019s tally of food-stamp recipients, which was more than 17,000 in 2012.\n\nIn Maine, LePage was elected governor in 2010 by running on an anti-welfare platform in a state that has also grown more reliant on public programs \u2014 in 2013, the state ranked third in the nation for food-stamp use, just ahead of Kentucky. LePage, who grew up poor in a large family, has gone at safety-net programs with a vengeance. He slashed welfare rolls by more than half after imposing a five-year limit, reinstituted a work requirement for food-stamp recipients and refused to expand Medicaid under Obamacare to cover 60,000 people. He is now seeking to bar anyone with more than $5,000 in certain assets from receiving food stamps. \u201cI\u2019m not going to help anybody just for the sake of helping,\u201d the governor said in September. \u201cI am not that compassionate.\u201d\n\nHis crusade has resonated with many in the state, who re-elected him last year.\n\nThat pattern is right in line with surveys, which show a decades-long decline in support for redistributive policies and an increase in conservatism in the electorate even as inequality worsens. There has been a particularly sharp drop in support for redistribution among older Americans, who perhaps see it as a threat to their own Social Security and Medicare. Meanwhile, researchers such as Kathryn Edin, of Johns Hopkins University, have pinpointed a tendency by Americans in the second lowest quintile of the income ladder \u2014 the working or lower-middle class \u2014 to dissociate themselves from those at the bottom, where many once resided. \u201cThere\u2019s this virulent social distancing \u2014 suddenly, you\u2019re a worker and anyone who is not a worker is a bad person,\u201d said Edin. \u201cThey\u2019re playing to the middle fifth and saying, \u2018I\u2019m not those people.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMeanwhile, many people who in fact most use and need social benefits are simply not voting at all. Voter participation is low among the poorest Americans, and in many parts of the country that have moved red, the rates have fallen off the charts. West Virginia ranked 50th for turnout in 2012; also in the bottom 10 were other states that have shifted sharply red in recent years, including Kentucky, Arkansas and Tennessee.\n\nIn the spring of 2012, I visited a free weekend medical and dental clinic run by the organization Remote Area Medical in the foothills of southern Tennessee. I wanted to ask the hundreds of uninsured people flocking to the clinic what they thought of President Obama and the Affordable Care Act, whose fate was about to be decided by the Supreme Court. I was expecting a \u201cWhat\u2019s the Matter With Kansas\u201d reaction \u2014 anger at the president who had signed the law geared to help them. Instead, I found sympathy for Obama. But had they voted for him? Of course not \u2014 almost no one I spoke with voted, in local, state or national elections. Not only that, but they had barely heard of the health care law.\n\nThis political disconnect among lower-income Americans has huge ramifications \u2014 polls find nonvoters are far more likely to favor spending on the poor and on government services than are voters, and the gap grows even larger among poor nonvoters. In the early 1990s, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky freely cited the desirability of having a more select electorate when he opposed an effort to expand voter registration. And this fall, Scott Jennings, a longtime McConnell adviser, reportedly said low turnout by poor Kentuckians explained why the state\u2019s Obamacare gains wouldn\u2019t help Democrats. \u201cI remember being in the room when Jennings was asked whether or not Republicans were afraid of the electoral consequences of displacing 400,000\u2013500,000 people who have insurance,\u201d State Auditor Adam Edelen, a Democrat who lost his re-election bid this year, told Joe Sonka, a Louisville journalist. \u201cAnd he simply said, \u2018People on Medicaid don\u2019t vote.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRepublicans would argue that the shift in their direction among voters slightly higher up the ladder is the natural progression of things \u2014 people recognize that government programs are prolonging the economic doldrums and that Republicans have a better economic program.\n\nSo where does this leave Democrats and anyone seeking to expand and build lasting support for safety-net programs such as Obamacare?\n\nFor starters, it means redoubling efforts to mobilize the people who benefit from the programs. This is no easy task with the rural poor, who are much more geographically scattered than their urban counterparts. Not helping matters in this regard is the decline of local institutions like labor unions \u2014 while the United Mine Workers of America once drove turnout in coal country, today there is not a single unionized mine still operating in Kentucky.\n\nBut it also means reckoning with the other half of the dynamic \u2014 finding ways to reduce the resentment that those slightly higher on the income ladder feel toward dependency in their midst. One way to do this is to make sure the programs are as tightly administered as possible. Instances of fraud and abuse are far rarer than welfare opponents would have one believe, but it only takes a few glaring instances to create a lasting impression. Edin, the Hopkins researcher, suggests going further and making it easier for those collecting disability to do part-time work over the table, not just to make them seem less shiftless in the eyes of their neighbors, but to reduce the recipients\u2019 own sense of social isolation.\n\nThe best way to reduce resentment, though, would be to bring about true economic growth in the areas where the use of government benefits is on the rise, the sort of improvement that is now belatedly being discussed for coal country, including on the presidential campaign trail. If fewer people need the safety net to get by, the stigma will fade, and low-income citizens will be more likely to re-engage in their communities \u2014 not least by turning out to vote.\n\nThis story was co-published by ProPublica and The New York Times' Sunday Review.\n\nAlso on HuffPost:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Who turned my blue state red?", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-11-21 20:59:36 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "Who turned my blue state red?", "title": "Here's Why States That Depend On A Safety Net Are Electing Politicians Who Shred It", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/whats-the-matter-with-maine_us_564fca49e4b0879a5b0b363f", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/564fcfa31700004b00e1a450.jpeg?cache=xe82ps7q39", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HuffPostPol", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/564fcfa31700004b00e1a450.jpeg?cache=xe82ps7q39", "height": 1000}, "description": "Who turned my blue state red?", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Here's Why States That Depend On A Safety Net Are Electing Politicians Who Shred It"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-20 20:59:36 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_564fca49e4b0879a5b0b363f", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Red States,Paul R.
