Not only is it cross-cultural, but when congenitally blind children who have never once seen another person become angry, they make this very same expression. Biologists have hypothesized the anger face is simply an arbitrary set of features that evolved to signal aggression. However, researchers at University of California, Santa Barbara, and Griffith University in Australia say there\u2019s nothing arbitrary about it.\n\nEach aspect of the anger face, their new study proves, suggests greater physical strength, which in turn increases an angry person\u2019s bargaining power. \"Since people who are judged to be stronger tend to get their way more often, other things being equal\u2026 the explanation for evolution of the form of the human anger face is surprisingly simple \u2014 it is a threat display,\" said Dr. Aaron Sell, a lecturer at the School of Criminology at Griffith University in Australia and lead author of the study.\n\nBreak It Down to Understand\n\nSeeing bared fangs during a conflict, an animal may inwardly tremble, fearing the strength of their opponent. In fact, all animals show displays of strength as a way to resolve conflict in their favor. We humans are not above such behavior: We, too, assess a competitor\u2019s ability by monitoring cues of physical power that register on the face. (Perhaps the toothy smile, commonly used as a greeting in America, but not in Europe or Asia, is a subtle version of bared fangs.) For the current study, the evolutionary psychologists proposed that if you broke down the muscle movements behind a single person\u2019s anger face, each would increase an observer\u2019s assessment of the person\u2019s strength.\n\nTo begin their experiment, the researchers broke down the human anger expression into seven distinct muscle groups contracting in a stereotypical manner. Then, they focused on the most common feature of the anger face, the lowered brow. After creating a computer-generated \u201caverage\u201d human face, they digitally morphed the expression in opposite directions to produce two separate photos, with one resulting photo showing a lowered brow, the other a raised brow. Despite the adjustments, neither of these two faces appeared angry. However, when participants viewed the two faces, they said the lowered brow face looked like it \u201cbelonged to a physically stronger man,\u201d Sell explained.\n\nNext, the researchers singled out each of the other major components of the anger face \u2014 raised cheekbones (as in a snarl), lips thinned and pushed out, the mouth raised (as in defiance), the nose flared, the chin pushed out and up \u2014 and created similar computer-generated faces. As with the lowered brow, they adjusted the faces to express an individual muscle contraction and paired it with the opposite expression. Time and again, when participants observed any photo with a component of the anger face, they judged that photo as belonging to a person who was physically stronger when they compared the paired opposite.\n\n\u201cWhat is most pleasing about these results is that no feature of the anger face appears to be arbitrary; they all deliver the same message,\" explained Dr. John Tooby, professor of Anthropology, UC Santa Barbara. In fact, each of the seven components having the exact same effect strengthens the researchers\u2019 argument. \"In the final analysis, you can think of the anger face as a constellation of features, each of which makes you appear physically more formidable,\" Sell said.\n\nSource: Sell A, Cosmides L, Tooby J.
