Myers has asked his staff to \u201cexplore possible places for worship for the future,\u201d said Jim Goodness, a spokesman for the archdiocese.\n\n\u201cWe all saw how the Jersey City community really came together today,\u201d Islamic center Board of Trustees President Ibrahim Eldewak said inside the armory building after nearly 200 members participated in afternoon prayers.\n\nThe board president of the 20-year-old Islamic center said: \u201cWe saw elected officials on the spot immediately. To us, it was emotional and moving to see everyone come to offer us help.\u201d\n\nHe said Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop and city council members arrived at the fire scene and quickly made the armory available.\n\nFriday afternoon prayer is the most important prayer session of the week and more than 1,000 worshipers normally attend at the center, said the 59-year-old Eldewak, adding that many likely prayed at home or went to other mosques yesterday. He said the center is working out how it will move forward and where daily prayers \u2014 observant Muslims pray five times a day \u2014 will be held until it reopens.\n\nMohamad Ali, 21, of Jersey City, said he believes the fire will revitalize the center.\n\n\u201cEveryone was kind of neglecting the mosque, including the youth, but Muslims and non-Muslims will come together to help now \u2014 they did today,\u201d said Ali.\n\nOn the day the mosque reopens, Ali said \u201cIt is going to be pleasing, a warm feeling, and I know everyone is going to come together before then.\u201d\n\nAsked if it was important to have a place for Friday prayers, Ali said: \u201cFriday is like a Saturday for Jews and Sunday for Christians. It was a great feeling for the city to give us the armory.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "jersey-city", "title": "Newark archbishop tells staff to explore worship spaces for Muslims displaced from fire-damaged Jersey City mosque", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Newark archbishop tells staff to explore worship spaces for Muslims displaced from fire-damaged Jersey City mosque \", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/03/post_260.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jersey-journal/photo/2014/02/14382843-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12321068\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-01T08:04:38Z\", \"author\": \"Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"jersey-city\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/02/14382843-small.jpg", "creator": "http://twitter/jerseyjournal", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Members of Jersey City's Al Tawheed Islamic Center lost their mosque to a fire yesterday, but they found a place to continue their daily prayers when city officials provided the Jersey City Armory for the day."}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, March 01, 2014,  3:04 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jersey-journal/photo/2014/02/14382843-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"mconte\", \"author_nickname\": \"Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"1860104\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Members of Jersey City's Al Tawheed Islamic Center lost their mosque to a fire yesterday, but they found a place to continue their daily prayers when city officials provided the Jersey City Armory for the day.", "title": "Newark archbishop tells staff to explore worship spaces for Muslims displaced from fire-damaged Jersey City mosque", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/03/post_260.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, March 01, 2014,  3:00 AM", "article_author": "Michaelangelo Conte | The Jersey Journal", "Description": "Members of Jersey City's Al Tawheed Islamic Center lost their mosque to a fire yesterday, but they found a place to continue their daily prayers when city officials provided the Jersey City Armory for the day."}, "article_summary": "The board president of the 20-year-old Islamic center said: \u201cWe saw elected officials on the spot immediately.\nMohamad Ali, 21, of Jersey City, said he believes the fire will revitalize the center.\nMembers of Jersey City\u2019s Al Tawheed Islamic Center lost their mosque to a fire yesterday, but they found a place to continue their daily prayers when city officials provided the Jersey City Armory for the day.\n\u201cWe all saw how the Jersey City community really came together today,\u201d Islamic center Board of Trustees President Ibrahim Eldewak said inside the armory building after nearly 200 members participated in afternoon prayers.\n\u201cEveryone was kind of neglecting the mosque, including the youth, but Muslims and non-Muslims will come together to help now \u2014 they did today,\u201d said Ali."}
