A 27-year-old North Dakota man, Steven James Anderson, was arrested and charged with driving under the influence — while operating a Zamboni at a local school’s female ice hockey match-up.

Spectators noticed he was driving the Zamboni in an erratic manner and called police, Fox News reported.

“I’ve been here for 22 years … and we have not had an incident like this before,” Jim Larson, of the Fargo Park District, told the Fargo-based newspaper, the Forum.

Mr. Anderson was driving the Zamboni at a Davies High School girls hockey game at the South Sports Arena in Fargo.
