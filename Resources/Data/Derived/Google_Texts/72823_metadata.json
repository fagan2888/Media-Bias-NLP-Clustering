On his show on Monday, Limbaugh claimed that requiring affirmative consent is an unreasonable standard because guys know that \u201cno means yes if you know how to spot it.\u201d\n\nIn the segment, which was first flagged by Media Matters, Limbaugh claimed that \u201cseduction used to be an art\u201d and college campuses are now making it into something that is considered to be \u201cbrutish\u201d and \u201cpredatory.\u201d He suggested it\u2019s unrealistic to require students to ask for permission every step of the way during a sexual encounter. \u201cAre these not lawsuits waiting to happen?\u201d the radio host said.\n\nLimbaugh\u2019s critics wasted no time calling for his removal, pointing out that his approach to sexual assault has no place in a society that\u2019s currently grappling with the best way to respond to intimate partner violence and campus rape cases.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s simply no excusing comments of this offensive nature, especially at a time where our country is having a long-overdue conversation about violence against women,\u201d Democratic Congressional Committee Chairman Rep. Steve Israel (D-NY) said in a statement released on Tuesday morning. \u201cPlain and simple \u2014 Rush Limbaugh is advocating for the tolerance of sexual assault and should be taken off the air immediately.\u201d\n\nLimbaugh is no stranger to criticism along those lines, especially when it comes to issues of misogyny. In 2012, he infamously called law student Sandra Fluke a \u201cslut\u201d and a \u201cprostitute\u201d after she advocated for Obamacare\u2019s contraception mandate. He also once said that single mothers are \u201csemen receptacles\u201d and that feminism was created to give ugly women a place in society. Over the past several years, petitions and boycott groups have urged Clear Channel to drop him, to no avail. Limbaugh has also been the subject of an ongoing campaign attempting to convince advertisers to stop supporting his show.\n\nLimbaugh\u2019s critiques of Ohio State\u2019s affirmative consent policy aren\u2019t entirely unusual. After California approved legislation that requires all college campuses to adopt a \u201cyes means yes\u201d standard of consent, critics rushed to argue that it was an over-reaching standard that would essentially \u201ckill the mood\u201d and turn everyone into rapists in the eyes of the law. In reality, affirmative consent simply encourages sexual partners to engage in open and honest communication to ensure they\u2019re both interested in having sex with each other.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Limbaugh is making headlines for saying that guys know \"no means yes if you know how to spot it.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Limbaugh is making headlines for saying that guys know \"no means yes if you know how to spot it.\"", "title": "Top Democrat Urges Radio Stations To Drop Rush Limbaugh After He Suggested \u2018No Means Yes\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/09/16/3568155/rush-limbaugh-sexual-consent/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AP10010108990.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Limbaugh is making headlines for saying that guys know \"no means yes if you know how to spot it.\"", "title": "Top Democrat Urges Radio Stations To Drop Rush Limbaugh After He Suggested \u2018No Means Yes\u2019", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AP10010108990-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AP10010108990.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/AP10010108990.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-16T12:36:24+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf2f2\"", "article_summary": "Health Top Democrat Urges Radio Stations To Drop Rush Limbaugh After He Suggested \u2018No Means Yes\u2019 CREDIT: AP Photo/Chris Carlson Rush LimbaughA top Democrat is calling on radio stations to stop broadcasting the Rush Limbaugh Show after the conservative radio host made headlines for mocking Ohio State University\u2019s new sexual assault policies, which require students to actively and explicitly agree to sexual activity.\nLimbaugh\u2019s critiques of Ohio State\u2019s affirmative consent policy aren\u2019t entirely unusual.\nAfter California approved legislation that requires all college campuses to adopt a \u201cyes means yes\u201d standard of consent, critics rushed to argue that it was an over-reaching standard that would essentially \u201ckill the mood\u201d and turn everyone into rapists in the eyes of the law.\nIn reality, affirmative consent simply encourages sexual partners to engage in open and honest communication to ensure they\u2019re both interested in having sex with each other.\n\u201cPlain and simple \u2014 Rush Limbaugh is advocating for the tolerance of sexual assault and should be taken off the air immediately.\u201dLimbaugh is no stranger to criticism along those lines, especially when it comes to issues of misogyny."}
