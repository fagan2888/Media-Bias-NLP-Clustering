Recalled items that were shipped to retail locations across the United States include 4-ounce glass jars containing \u201cStage 2 Beech-Nut CLASSICS sweet potato & chicken.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Beech-Nut, we strive to make baby food with the best ingredients nature has to offer \u2014 freshly prepared and packaged in clean, safe, and environmentally-friendly packaging. So, when any product of ours falls short of those standards, we take swift action to correct it,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nJars of baby food included in the recall were produced on Dec. 12, 2014. Products are marked \u201cDEC 2016\u201d and feature product numbers \u201c12395750815\u201d through \u201c12395750821\u201d on the cap. The recall does not affect any other production dates, jars, or varieties, Beech-Nut explained:\n\nWe have initiated a voluntary recall for our Classics Stage 2 Sweet Potato & Chicken following a single report of a small glass piece found in a jar of the product. Outside of this single report, we have no indication that any other jar of our Classics Stage 2 Sweet Potato & Chicken is affected, but as a company of parents and families we are acting with an abundance of caution.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Beech-Nut Nutrition was first made aware of the problem after receiving a complaint from a consumer who found a small piece of glass in the product. The company also received a report of an oral injury tied to the consumption of recalled products.\n\n\u201cThe quality and safety of our products is our number one priority,\u201d the company added. \u201cWe know we have not met the expectations of parents who rely on Beech-Nut for quality nutrition for their babies and toddlers in this case, and for that we apologize.\u201d\n\nCustomers who believe their child may have consumed a recalled product have been advised to consult a medical professional. Those in possession of recalled products can return them to the store where they were purchased.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "beech, nut, nutrition, baby, food, recall", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Beech-Nut Nutrition is recalling nearly 2,000 pounds of baby food due to potential glass contamination.", "title": "Beech-Nut Nutrition Recalls Baby Food Due To Glass Contamination", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/baby-food-recall-beech-nut-nutrition-voluntarily-recalls-products-due-glass-329338", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/15/beech-nut-nutrition.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Beech-Nut Nutrition is recalling nearly 2,000 pounds of baby food due to potential glass contamination.", "title": "Beech-Nut Nutrition Recalls Baby Food Due To Glass Contamination", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/baby-food-recall-beech-nut-nutrition-voluntarily-recalls-products-due-glass-329338", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/15/beech-nut-nutrition.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/15/beech-nut-nutrition.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-15T11:37:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-15T11:36:58-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Beech-Nut Nutrition is recalling nearly 2,000 pounds of baby food due to potential glass contamination."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf7fd\"", "article_summary": "Beech-Nut Nutrition, an Amsterdam, New York-based baby food company, has issued a voluntary recall for approximately 1,920 pounds of baby food after a customer found a small piece of glass in one of the company\u2019s products.\nThose in possession of recalled products can return them to the store where they were purchased.\nJars of baby food included in the recall were produced on Dec. 12, 2014.\nThe company also received a report of an oral injury tied to the consumption of recalled products.\nProducts are marked \u201cDEC 2016\u201d and feature product numbers \u201c12395750815\u201d through \u201c12395750821\u201d on the cap."}
