And it temporarily suspended two taxes on industry already being collected, which are also part of the health law.\n\nIn contrast to frontal attacks on \u201cObamacare\u201d that have repeatedly failed, this tactic could well succeed. Delays and suspensions have a way of becoming permanent.\n\nPolls show that the public remains deeply divided over the Affordable Care Act, or ACA. Opponents are already looking for other provisions that could be separated from the law.\n\nNext could be the \u201cemployer mandate,\u201d a requirement that larger companies offer coverage or risk fines. Part of the mandate is a controversial definition of a full-time worker as someone who averages 30 hours a week. Critics say it discourages companies from hiring full-time employees.\n\n\u201cMaybe Republicans have come to grips with the idea that the basic structure of the ACA has been in place long enough that simple repeal is not possible,\u201d said economist Joe Antos of the American Enterprise Institute, a business-oriented think tank. Perhaps the budget deal \u201cis practice\u201d for more changes, he added.\n\nSupporters of the health care law are trying to downplay the consequences of the budget deal as superficial dings. It did not touch coverage provisions that have reduced the nation\u2019s uninsured rate to a historic low of 9 percent. Indeed, Obama himself announced that 6 million people have already signed up for 2016 coverage, with more than a month left in open-enrollment season.\n\n\u201cI think you can make too much of these particular things,\u201d said economist Paul Van de Water of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, referring to the deal. \u201cThey don\u2019t actually have any effect on the ACA\u2019s coverage expansion. In that sense, it\u2019s not a blow against the ACA at all.\u201d The center advocates on behalf of low-income people.\n\nYet not too long ago a top White House adviser was vigorously defending the health law\u2019s tax on high-cost coverage, known as the Cadillac tax.\n\nThe tax is 40 percent of the value of employer-sponsored plans that exceeds certain thresholds: $10,200 for individual coverage and $27,500 for family coverage. In its first year, 2018, it would have affected 26 percent of all employers and nearly half of larger companies, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Since the tax is indexed to general inflation, which rises more slowly than health insurance premiums, it would have affected a growing share of health plans over time.\n\nProponents of the tax, including many economists, see it as a much-needed brake on health care spending. But business and labor joined forces to oppose it. The budget deal delayed it two years, and its future is in doubt.\n\nThe spirited defense of the tax came from Jason Furman, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. \u201cRepealing the tax or delaying its scheduled implementation \u2026 would have serious negative consequences for our health care system,\u201d Furman warned in a speech Oct. 7.\n\nPulling back on cost controls in the health law would erode the wages of workers and add to government deficits, Furman explained, adding that \u201cthe administration opposes legislation that would repeal or delay this provision.\u201d\n\nFast forward to a recent White House news briefing, when spokesman Josh Earnest seemed to soften that stance. While Earnest said the administration strongly opposed repealing the Cadillac tax, he didn\u2019t address the notion of delaying it.\n\nThe health law\u2019s employer mandate is the next likely focus for opponents, said Antos, the economist.\n\n\u201cThe really large employers are not going to stop offering health insurance, since it\u2019s an important benefit,\u201d he said. \u201cEven analysts on the left would agree that that mandate isn\u2019t going to accomplish much.\u201d\n\nSimilar to the Cadillac tax, the employer requirement raises concerns on both sides of the political divide. That could put the mandate into play when Congress again tackles a budget bill, or some other massive piece of legislation on which lots of trades get made behind closed doors.\n\nThe step-by-step approach has led to other health law changes.
