Nexsen Pruet is the firm where Lexington County administrator Joe Mergo\u2019s wife (S.C. Sen. Nikki Setzler\u2019s daughter) is a partner.\n\nNexsen Pruet already contributed $1,000 to Banning. Since this event is inside the 10-day window for the runoff election, Banning\u2019s contributors from it won\u2019t be disclosed until AFTER the runoff election. You\u2019re invited!\n\nBanning filed his pre-election campaign report AFTER the primary election. Let\u2019s see if he gets fined for that. This report showed that almost all his contributions have been from Richland County individuals and businesses, and particularly the Mungo home construction empire, allies of the S.C. Realtors association, John Roof and the S.C. Homebuilders Association \u2013 all of whom are in the local real estate/ development cabal.\n\nAll of them would benefit from the \u201cPenny for Progress\u201d sales tax which Banning and disgraced former Lexington mayor Randy Halfacre are pushing.\n\nBanning\u2019s expenditures show he had polling done by Conquest Communications \u2013 a Virginia-based company that also did polling for the \u201cPenny for Progress\u201d effort. He also spent $1,000 on \u201cseeds\u201d from former county councilman Smokey Davis.\n\nHow can you spend $1,000 on seeds?\n\nBanning also has an expenditure of under $1,000 for signs \u2013 although he has at least two hundred signs out. This implies he is not reporting all his contributions/ contributors.\n\n\u201cDollar Bill\u201d Banning is in runoff with Ned Tolar who is a true fiscal conservative. We hear that Tolar submitted a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the county for information on a $450,000 contract awarded to Alliance Engineering \u2013 a York and Richland County entity \u2013 and after almost two months Lexington County still won\u2019t release details of the contract or produce the RFP.\n\nAs you now live in Lexington County (you\u2019re welcome!) you may want to report on the insider and fishy dealings going on here.\n\n-Concerned Lexington Resident\n\nSIC SEZ\n\nYou know I moved out of downtown Columbia, S.C. (in part) to get away from stuff like this \u2026 guess when it comes to corrupt politicians ripping off gullible taxpayers to benefit themselves and their allies, there\u2019s nothing new under the sun no matter where you go in the Palmetto State. Anyway \u2026 thanks for passing this information along.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.fitsnews.com/2014/06/16/letter-lexington-county-shenanigans/", "type": "article", "image": "http://fitsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/letter.jpg", "site_name": "http://www.fitsnews.com", "title": "Letter: Lexington County Shenanigans"}, "google-site-verification": "qt01SY7jA5pURQJ_8ITASviDysHU8yHfJWpIIdAPKQU", "robots": "noodp", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7db2\"", "article_summary": "Since this event is inside the 10-day window for the runoff election, Banning\u2019s contributors from it won\u2019t be disclosed until AFTER the runoff election.\nNexsen Pruet is the firm where Lexington County administrator Joe Mergo\u2019s wife (S.C.
