(Photo: ~File)\n\nFREEHOLD TOWNSHIP All lanes of Route 9 were reopened after an accident closed part of the road this morning, but the jughandle turns to Brookdale Community College's Freehold campus and the Freehold Mall Shopping Center remained closed because the crash took out a traffic light there, police said.\n\nThe accident occurred shortly before 10 a.m. on Route 9 north, just south of Route 537 and north of Schanck Road, when a 26-year-old Jackson man heading north experienced a medical condition and struck the light stanchion, knocking it into the street, said Lt. Raymond Piccolini.\n\nThe driver, who may have suffered a seizure, is not believed to have sustained any injuries in the one-car crash, but was taken to CentraState Medical Center in the township for treatment of the initial medical emergency, Piccolini said.\n\nA portion of Route 9 was initially closed until crews were able to move the downed traffic light out of the roadway, he said.\n\nHowever, the jughandles remained closed because there is no traffic light operating there, he said.\n\nNo summonses were issued, and police do not plan to release the driver's name because the accident was due to a medical emergency, Piccolini said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1EOnXBO", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A portion of northbound Route 9 is closed as police investigate a traffic accident that occurred about 10 a.m.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "A portion of northbound Route 9 is closed as police investigate a traffic accident that occurred about 10 a.m.", "title": "Rt. 9 northbound closed at scene of accident in Freehold Township", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/2015/09/07/rt-9-northbound-closed-scene-accident-freehold-township/71837560/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A portion of northbound Route 9 is closed as police investigate a traffic accident that occurred about 10 a.m.", "title": "Rt. 9 northbound closed at scene of accident in Freehold Township", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/095d87ad06ea2a9d131d4e5e07da6b57f4b1e5c2/c=326-0-2506-2180&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/04/Bridgewater/B9318686450Z.1_20150904140048_000_G9PBFMA74.21-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf9c3\"", "article_summary": "However, the jughandles remained closed because there is no traffic light operating there, he said.\nA portion of Route 9 was initially closed until crews were able to move the downed traffic light out of the roadway, he said.\n(Photo: ~File)FREEHOLD TOWNSHIP All lanes of Route 9 were reopened after an accident closed part of the road this morning, but the jughandle turns to Brookdale Community College's Freehold campus and the Freehold Mall Shopping Center remained closed because the crash took out a traffic light there, police said.\nNo summonses were issued, and police do not plan to release the driver's name because the accident was due to a medical emergency, Piccolini said.\nPolice blotter in Hunterdon County."}
