Doors open at 4:30 p.m. and the concert will begin at 5:30 p.m. The tribute performer is Terry Lee Goffey and from what I have seen, it looks to be a great show.\n\nSome of you have already been contacted by phone to contribute. The callers will be working diligently for the next couple months contacting individuals about the show. If you have any concerns or questions, please contact your police department or sheriff\u2019s office and they will get you in contact with someone to answer any questions you may have. Crime Stoppers is a non- profit 501(c)3 corporation.\n\nThe reason for having a fundraiser such as this is that we are in the process of implementing the Tip Soft crime reporting service. Almost every county in the state is using this system which is in part a benefit to the Crime Stoppers as all the CS organizations can now interact with each other much more easily.\n\nThe other important factor is one more layer of anonymity for tip callers using the service. All of the calls made up to now by tipsters are anonymous, but we now have a text-tip service to compliment a phone call. Text \u201cTip1301\u201d plus your tip to 274637 (crimes) or you can use our Facebook page to report a tip.\n\nThank you and again please join us on Sunday, Aug. 28, for a show you will not want to miss.\n\nGreg Swan, president\n\nPortage County Crime Stoppers\n\nPlover\n\nRead or Share this story: http://spjour.nl/1pmx3yX", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Johnny Cash tribute will help fund new text-tip line", "og": {"site_name": "Stevens Point Journal Media", "description": "Johnny Cash tribute will help fund new text-tip line", "title": "Crime Stoppers to host fundraiser", "url": "http://www.stevenspointjournal.com/story/opinion/readers/2016/03/15/crime-stoppers-host-fundraiser/81826260/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/stevenspointjournal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Johnny Cash tribute will help fund new text-tip line", "creator": "@StevensPointJRL", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/46e8a74bc6a9d74ef7dce155a2b8b6514883d93f/c=0-226-1521-1747&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/03/15/StevensPoint/B9321349724Z.1_20160315165809_000_GE7DP02AB.1-0.jpg", "title": "Portage County Crime Stoppers fundraiser planned in August", "site": "@StevensPointJRL", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884242174", "fb": {"app_id": 116784471723374}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Terry Lee Goffey"}, "article_summary": "Man in Black (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)EDITOR: As president of the Portage County Crime Stoppers I would like to extend an invitation to join us in our first public fundraiser.\nGreg Swan, presidentPortage County Crime StoppersPloverRead or Share this story: http://spjour.nl/1pmx3yX\nCrime Stoppers is a non- profit 501(c)3 corporation.\nThe reason for having a fundraiser such as this is that we are in the process of implementing the Tip Soft crime reporting service.\nAlmost every county in the state is using this system which is in part a benefit to the Crime Stoppers as all the CS organizations can now interact with each other much more easily."}
