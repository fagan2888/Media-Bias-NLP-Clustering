Louisiana's former top health official will continue to push state legislators to expand Medicaid in the state, even though the measure proved to be politically unpopular last year.

Former Health and Hospitals Secretary David Hood plans to lobby for the government-funded health program's growth during the legislative session that starts in March. He acknowledged the fight for Medicaid expansion, a nonstarter with many conservatives, would be an uphill battle in a state where both houses and the Governor's office are controlled by Republicans.

"We seem to be stuck in Louisiana, but we are not giving up," Hood said during a meeting of the Press Club of Baton Rouge on Monday (Jan. 13).

Under the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, the federal government provides extra funding to states who agree to expand Medicaid, a health insurance program for the poor. Gov. Bobby Jindal has declined to accept the additional money, saying he is opposed to the enlargement of government-run programs on principle.

Louisiana would have to spend about $1.8 billion to support the Medicaid expansion over the next 10 years, but the federal government's portion of the bill, about $18.5 billion, would be much more substantial. In the first three years of Medicaid expansion, the federal government would also cover the cost of running the program entirely, said Hood.

Some conservatives have argued that the federal government may eventually roll back its funding from the Medicaid expansion altogether and stick the states entirely will the bill of providing health care to low-income adults. But Hood said he didn't think that would occur.

"I don't think they are going to pull the rug out from under all these states that have done the expansion," he said.
