BARABOO (WKOW) – The Baraboo School Board on Monday night voted to amend its athletic and co-curricular activity policy to better guard against discrimination of transgender students.The policy change, with school board members said was a necessary adjustment to comply with federal as well as state, WIAA guidelines, includes language to prohibit discrimination of transgender students.A transgender student is one who identifies with a gender other than the one they were physically born as.WIAA guidelines, released in 2013, call for transgender students to be given a fair opportunity to play on the sports teams of the gender with which they identify.For instance, the policy calls for a student born a male who identifies or expresses himself as a female to be given the opportunity to play on female sports teams – so long as that student complies with certain medical and administrative requirements.The WIAA policy says the safety of both transgender students and the rest of a school's student population should be taken into consideration in deciding who is eligible to play on certain sports teams.Opponents of the proposal spoke of safety concerns.They told the board the school district has not clarified how transgender students would be assigned to locker rooms or restrooms, and whether they would be allowed to use a locker room with other students on the same sports team.Several opponents of the proposal said they would like to see it put off or even put to Baraboo's voters through a referendum.Supporters of the proposal said the policy proposal is necessary to keep with the times and ensure fairness and equality for all students.School Board President Kevin Vodak compared the policy proposal to divisive, political issues like Act 10 and the Affordable Care Act. Vodak was among those who voted against the proposal.It ultimately passed the school board four to three.*************************************BARABOO (WKOW) – The Baraboo School board is scheduled to discuss and vote on a policy formalizing the district's stance on transgender athletes Monday night.The proposed change in the school's policy on athletics would include “gender expression” and “gender identity” in the school's anti-discrimination policy, thus preventing a student's gender identity or expression from prohibiting him or her from competing on a sports team.\School board member Doug Mering said by phone Monday afternoon that the school district is seeking to make sure its values and missions are being applied equally to all students.Mering said the policy would express the school's support and compliance with the WIAA's suggested policy for transgender athletes , which was released in 2013.The WIAA guidelines call for specific qualifications to be met in the case of each, individual student athlete in order to ensure student safety and fair competition. Those include use of hormone therapy.Mering said he is not aware of any transgender students enrolled in the Baraboo School District at the moment, but said it was good to have a policy in place.Those opposed to the plan have in the past said it could create unsafe situations in locker rooms and rest rooms.Mering said usage of such facilities would be worked out on an individual, case by case basis depending on each, transgender student.
