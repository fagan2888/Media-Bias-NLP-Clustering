The lawsuit seeks over $5.5 billion in damages from Oracle, plus legal fees.\n\nThe complaint comes after Oracle filed its own lawsuit against the state\u2019s health exchange for failure to pay for services rendered in early August. Oracle\u2019s attorneys claimed that Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber had defamed the company in a \u201csmear campaign\u201d while failing to take responsibility for the failure of state management of the project and not paying Oracle for additional work done.\n\nThe 126-page complaint, filed by Rosenblum in Oregon\u2019s Marion County Circuit Court on August 22, claims that Oracle pushed the state to not hire a systems integrator for the project, giving the company total control over the development of the site and allowing company executives to conceal problems with the software. \u201cAccording to a former Oracle employee, Oracle advanced a \u2018planned\u2019 behind-the-scenes effort' to convince the State 'that a Systems Integrator would just cause delay,'\u201d Rosenblum wrote in the complaint. \u201cThe former employee explained that \u2018the message was 'we\u2019ve got to make sure that [the State] doesn\u2019t bring [a Systems Integrator] in because it\u2019s just going to cause us trouble.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe lobbying resulted in Oregon officials giving Oracle the system integrator role, which allowed the company to conceal problems with software and essentially bill for fixes to the software that should have been covered under the license agreements for the software itself, the attorney general asserted. In the filing, she said, \u201cOracle repeatedly breached contracts by failing to deliver on its obligations, overcharging for poorly trained Oracle personnel to provide incompetent work, hiding from the State the true extent of Oracle\u2019s shoddy performance, continuing to promise what it could not deliver, and willfully refusing to honor its warranty to fix its errors without charge.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Rosenblum claimed, \u201cOver the last three years, Oracle has presented the State and Cover Oregon with some $240,280,008 in false claims under those contracts.\u201d\n\nOracle, for its part, claims that the state is using the company as a scapegoat for its own gross mismanagement of the project. \u201cCover Oregon and public officials could have done two things in the face of those press reports: (a) own up to the management and technical challenges they had encountered and commit to a plan for resolving them; or (b) blame someone else,\u201d Oracle\u2019s attorneys wrote in their August 5 filing. \u201cThey chose the latter, and they fixed their sights on Oracle. While flogging Oracle publicly, Cover Oregon continued privately to ask for Oracle\u2019s help.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the failure of the Cover Oregon site, the state has abandoned its own planned exchange and has shifted to using the federal site. It\u2019s likely that much of any award Oregon\u2019s suit would be returned to the Federal government, which provided a grant for the site\u2019s development under the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://arstechnica.com/subscriptions/;icon-uri=https://cdn.arstechnica.net/ie-jump-menu/jump-subscribe.ico", "description": "State claims Oracle hid problems with health exchange, conspired to overcharge.", "application-name": "Ars Technica", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Oregon Attorney General sues Oracle for \\u201cracketeering activity\\u201d\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/arstechnica.com\\/tech-policy\\/2014\\/08\\/oregon-attorney-general-sues-oracle-for-racketeering-activity\\/\",\"type\":\"post\",\"author\":\"Sean Gallagher\",\"post_id\":524867,\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-25T16:34:10Z\",\"section\":\"Law & Disorder\",\"tags\":[\"affordable-care-act\",\"health-exchange\",\"obamacare\",\"oracle\",\"oregon\",\"system-integrator\",\"type: report\"],\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.arstechnica.net\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/02\\/oracle.1-150x150.jpg\"}", "twitter": {"domain": "arstechnica.com", "description": "State claims Oracle hid problems with health exchange, conspired to overcharge.", "creator": "@thepacketrat", "url": "http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/08/oregon-attorney-general-sues-oracle-for-racketeering-activity/", "image": {"src": "http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/oracle.1.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "title": "Oregon Attorney General sues Oracle for \u201cracketeering activity\u201d", "site": "@arstechnica", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Ars Technica: Serving the technologist for 1.2 decades", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"report\",\"title\":\"Oregon Attorney General sues Oracle for \\u201cracketeering activity\\u201d\",\"post_id\":524867,\"lower_deck\":\"State claims Oracle hid problems with health exchange, conspired to overcharge.\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.arstechnica.net\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/02\\/oracle.1-150x150.jpg\",\"listing_image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/cdn.arstechnica.net\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/02\\/oracle.1-300x150.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "Ars Technica", "description": "State claims Oracle hid problems with health exchange, conspired to overcharge.", "title": "Oregon Attorney General sues Oracle for \u201cracketeering activity\u201d", "url": "http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/08/oregon-attorney-general-sues-oracle-for-racketeering-activity/", "image": "http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/oracle.1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 10103365229664579}, "theme-color": "#000000", "msapplication-starturl": "http://arstechnica.com/", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=1020", "advertising": "ask"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd425f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOracle\u2019s conduct amounts to a pattern of racketeering activity that has cost the State and Cover Oregon hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum wrote in a civil complaint filed August 22.\nWhile flogging Oracle publicly, Cover Oregon continued privately to ask for Oracle\u2019s help.\u201dAs a result of the failure of the Cover Oregon site, the state has abandoned its own planned exchange and has shifted to using the federal site.\n\u201cAccording to a former Oracle employee, Oracle advanced a \u2018planned\u2019 behind-the-scenes effort' to convince the State 'that a Systems Integrator would just cause delay,'\u201d Rosenblum wrote in the complaint.\nIn the aftermath of what was likely the most spectacular failure among state-run Affordable Care Act health exchange site launches, the state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit against Oracle America Inc. over the total failure of the Cover Oregon exchange.\nThe complaint comes after Oracle filed its own lawsuit against the state\u2019s health exchange for failure to pay for services rendered in early August."}
