HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Monday it\u2019s the \u201clargest reduction in the uninsured in four decades.\u201d\n\nSign up for THE BRIEF and more view example\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to the key metrics of affordability, access, and quality, the evidence shows that the Affordable Care Act is working, and families, businesses and taxpayers are better off as a result,\u201d Burwell said in a statement.\n\nAbout 14.1 million adults gained insurance since insurance marketplaces opened up in October 2013 and another 2.3 million young adults were able to stay on their parents insurance until age 26 under the law. According to the data, the uninsured rate is slightly lower in states that have expanded Medicaid coverage compared to those that have not.\n\nThe uninsured rate has dropped significantly for minorities under the law. Since 2013, 2.3 million black adults have gained insurance resulting in 9.2 percent point drop in the uninsured rate. About 29.5% of Hispanic adults are still uninsured, the highest uninsured rate among American adults, but some 4.2 million have gained coverage.\n\nThe news comes as the fate of the Affordable Care Act lies in hands of the Supreme Court which heard oral arguments in a case that could essentially gut the President\u2019s signature health law.\n\nRead next: Your Boss May Be Able To Force You To Buy Health Insurance\n\nListen to the most important stories of the day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Over the past five years, about 16.4 million previously uninsured people have gained insurance under the Affordable Care Act.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Over the past five years.", "title": "16.4 Million Have Gotten Insurance Under Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://time.com/3745948/obamacare-uninsured/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/healthcare-obamacare.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/healthcare-obamacare.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Over the past five years.", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "16.4 Million Have Gotten Insurance Under Affordable Care Act"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "obama administration, affordable care act, obamacare, obamacare numbers, obamacare information, obama, care", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Obama administration, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, Obamacare numbers, Obamacare information, Obama, Care"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd2c2\"", "article_summary": "Over the past five years, about 16.4 million previously uninsured people have gained insurance under the Affordable Care Act, the Obama Administration announced Monday.\nAbout 14.1 million adults gained insurance since insurance marketplaces opened up in October 2013 and another 2.3 million young adults were able to stay on their parents insurance until age 26 under the law.\nSince 2013, 2.3 million black adults have gained insurance resulting in 9.2 percent point drop in the uninsured rate.\nAbout 29.5% of Hispanic adults are still uninsured, the highest uninsured rate among American adults, but some 4.2 million have gained coverage.\nAccording to the data, the uninsured rate is slightly lower in states that have expanded Medicaid coverage compared to those that have not."}
