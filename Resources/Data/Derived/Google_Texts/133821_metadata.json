As pointed out here yesterday, 27 million Americans lose their health insurance if Congress gets its way. The rich, of course, get to keep theirs.\n\nWhat is interesting is the way in which House Speaker John Boehner chose to present this dubious accomplishment. Taking to Facebook, he posted,\n\nAs you can see, being Boehner, he chose anything but an honest approach.\n\nIn a statement yesterday, Boehner claimed:\n\nIn seven years, President Obama has never proposed a budget that balances. For a span of four years, Senate Democrats didn\u2019t pass a budget at all. Now, four months into the new Congress, Republican majorities in the House and Senate worked together to pass the first joint 10-year balanced budget in 14 years. This is a big win for the American people, and a fulfillment of our promise to govern responsibly and return the annual appropriations process to regular order. Workers and families deserve a federal government that spends within its means and treats Americans\u2019 hard-earned tax dollars with respect.\n\nWell, at least the treats the non-taxed dollars of the rich with respect.\n\nMitch McConnell did some crowing of his own on Facebook:\n\nWe should all fall down on our knees and cry out, \u201cWe\u2019re not worthy!\u201d as we bow toward the great one, right?\n\nWhat\u2019s funny about all this crowing is that thanks to Obama and the Democrats, we have had 51 consecutive months of job growth, and added 9.4 million jobs to the economy. And he wants to give us 1.2 million over TEN YEARS?\n\nBoehner and McConnell are living in an alternate universe.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem. Funny doesn\u2019t get the job done. We need serious effort, not unintentional comedy from Republicans.\n\nFor the record, McConnell isn\u2019t making Republicans all that happy either. The Daily Caller has complained that McConnell plans to add billions to the deficit in a separate bill, making the balanced budget no more than sleight of hand. Bernie Sanders agrees. He has already exposed a laundry lit of budget gimmicks:\n\nUsing the Overseas Contingency Operations fund, which falls outside of the budget caps to significantly increase defense spending;\n\nMasking the true consequences of their policies under the guise of \u2018unallocated\u2019 cuts and \u2018government-wide\u2019 savings;\n\nOnly achieving their goal of \u2018balance\u2019 by using made-up \u2018dynamic\u2019 numbers; and\n\nDismantling health care reform, but keeping the savings and revenues that support it.\n\nHowever, there are more serious problems with this budget than simple dishonesty. As Nancy Pelosi has pointed out, what she calls \u201cthe GOP\u2019s \u201cWork Harder for Less\u201d budget\u201d:\n\nslashes programs for K-12 education\n\ncuts Pell Grants that help low-income students attend college\n\nrepeals the Affordable Care Act\n\ncuts investments in infrastructure and innovation\n\n\u201cAnd let\u2019s not forget,\u201d she says, \u201cthe GOP budget does all of those things while empowering special interests and paving the way for huge tax breaks for millionaires.\u201d\n\nAmerica of the rich, by the rich, and for the rich. Pelosi reminds us that \u201cThis budget makes it harder to buy a home, pay for college, or save for a secure retirement. Put simply: the GOP budget is a DISASTER for hardworking families, while millionaires and billionaires make out like bandits.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t you love these two clowns telling us how great an opportunity we have standing before us being peons for the rich and serfs for the corporations?\n\nThe GOP\u2019s American dream is not OUR American dream. It is not the American dream that has attracted millions to these shores. Immigrants today, like our immigrant ancestors, want something more than the chance to be a form of sustenance for the 1 Percent.\n\nIf the Republicans want to throw away all their gains in 2016, they are going about it the right way.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans are making much of their \"balanced\" budget but this \"work harder for less\" budget is not really balanced at all", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Republicans are making much of their \"balanced\" budget but this \"work harder for less\" budget is not really balanced at all", "title": "Boehner and McConnell Balance Their Budget on the Backs of the American People", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/05/06/boehner-mcconnell-balance-budget-backs-american-people.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/mcconnell-boehner.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-06T07:56:16+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Republican Party,america,Congress,Conservatism in the United States,John Boehner,mitch mcconnell,Nancy Pelosi,Presidency of Barack Obama,United States House of Representatives,United States Senate,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2015-05-06T07:56:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-06T07:56:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "america, Congress, Conservatism in the United States, John Boehner, mitch mcconnell, Nancy Pelosi, Presidency of Barack Obama, Republican Party, United States House of Representatives, United States Senate"}, "article_summary": "The GOP\u2019s American dream is not OUR American dream.\nIt is not the American dream that has attracted millions to these shores.\nThe House did it, then the Senate did it, killing a budget that attacks the American people.\nIn a statement yesterday, Boehner claimed:In seven years, President Obama has never proposed a budget that balances.\nWhat is interesting is the way in which House Speaker John Boehner chose to present this dubious accomplishment."}
