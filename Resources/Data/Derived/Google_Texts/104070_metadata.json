Bloomberg News/ Jessica Hromas\n\nQuestions about who will succeed Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. co-founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts, both in their 70s, have swirled for years, and the firm still isn\u2019t giving any hints.\n\nDuring a presentation today to the firm\u2019s public shareholders at Keefe Bruyette & Woods\u2019 Asset Management Conference, Chief Financial Officer Bill Janetschek said KKR\u2019s management committee consists of 13 members in addition to Messrs. Kravis and Roberts. \u201cEveryone is qualified to run the firm,\u201d said Mr. Janetschek.\n\nThe co-founders, meanwhile, are very active, Mr. Janetschek said, adding that he and Mr. Kravis spoke on the phone several times the previous day, and that he and Mr. Roberts exchanged emails late into evening.\n\nMessrs. Kravis and Roberts are \u201cnot going anywhere anytime soon,\u201d said Mr. Janetschek. \u201cBut should that time come, it\u2019s not going to be problematic.\u201d\n\nKKR\u2019s management committee\u2013its top executive echelon\u2013includes such people as Alexander Navab, head of Americas private equity; and Scott Nuttall, head of global capital and asset management group.\n\nKKR isn\u2019t the only megafirm facing succession questions. The founders of Carlyle Group, Apollo Global Management and Blackstone Group are all still actively managing their respective firms.\n\nBut there has been movement in the inner circles of some of these shops. In March, Carlyle named Michael Cavanagh, a former J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. executive that was seen as a front-runner to succeed Chief Executive James Dimon, as the firm\u2019s co-chief operating officer along with long-time Carlyle executive Glenn A. Youngkin.\n\nThat same month, Apollo President Marc Spilker announced his intention to step down. It was later reported that two senior partners in the private equity division were also planning to depart the firm.\n\nWhile still uncertain, the succession path at Blackstone Group may be among the most clear. The Wall Street Journal reported in January that Jonathan Gray, head of the firm\u2019s real estate business and mastermind of the lucrative Hilton deal, is said to be the top candidate to succeed President Hamilton \u201cTony\u201d James as the firm\u2019s No. 2 executive.\n\nOf course Mr. Gray, or any other players from Blackstone\u2019s bench, may have quite a time to wait. Similar to KKR\u2019s top executives, Mr. James and Co-Founder and Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman have shown no desire to retire anytime soon.\n\n[CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post incorrectly identified the KKR executive speaking during a presentation as Craig Larson, head of investor relations. The person speaking was Chief Financial Officer Bill Janetschek.]\n\nWrite to Shasha Dai at shasha.dai@wsj.com.
