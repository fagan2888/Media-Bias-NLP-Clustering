That\u2019s down from 6.2 percent a year earlier and the smallest share since the first three months of 2012, when prices bottomed after the crash, said the Irvine, Calif.-based data company, which defines a flip as a property sold within 12 months of purchase.\n\nReal estate investors are making smaller profits and finding fewer opportunities for deals after a two-year surge in property values that\u2019s now slowing. The median existing-home price climbed 4.9 percent in July from a year earlier, compared with a 13.1 percent jump in the same month of 2013, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Distressed homes accounted for the lowest share of sales since at least 2008.\n\n\u201cThe flippers\u2019 formula is to buy a property that they can add value to at a discount and sell at a premium,\u201d said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac. \u201cNow home price appreciation has slowed dramatically in many of the flipping meccas, and the availability of discounted distressed properties has dried up.\u201d\n\nThe average gross profit per home flip in the second quarter was $46,000, or 21 percent of the return on the original investment, down from a peak of 31 percent a year earlier, RealtyTrac said.\n\nThe metro areas with the most flips were Phoenix, Los Angeles and Miami. Flips in Phoenix and Los Angeles represented a smaller share of transactions from a year earlier, while Miami had an increase, according to RealtyTrac. The best returns were in Pittsburgh; New Orleans; Baltimore; Virginia Beach, Va.; and Daytona Beach, Fla., the company said.\n\nThe share of high-end flips is increasing as fewer distressed properties become available. Homes with a sale price of $750,000 or higher represented 4.1 percent of properties sold quickly during the quarter, up from 3.4 percent a year earlier. Sales of $750,000 to $1 million provided the best return, at an average 41 percent, RealtyTrac said.\n\nPrashant Gopal,\n\nBloomberg News", "article_metadata": {"description": "Real estate investors are making smaller profits and finding fewer opportunities for deals.", "og": {"description": "Real estate investors are making smaller profits and finding fewer opportunities for deals.", "title": "Home flipping wanes as property buyers find fewer bargains", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140824-home-flipping-wanes-as-property-buyers-find-fewer-bargains.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-08-25T00:55:20Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-08-25T00:28:06Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Home flipping wanes as property buyers find fewer bargains\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/personal-finance/headlines/20140824-home-flipping-wanes-as-property-buyers-find-fewer-bargains.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1877625\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-08-25T00:28:06Z\", \"section\": \"Economy & You Headlines\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-08-25T00:28:06Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0048\"", "article_summary": "Almost 31,000 single-family houses were flipped in the second quarter, representing 4.6 percent of U.S. home sales, RealtyTrac said in a report last week.\nThe share of high-end flips is increasing as fewer distressed properties become available.\nReal estate investors are making smaller profits and finding fewer opportunities for deals after a two-year surge in property values that\u2019s now slowing.\nHome flipping, in which a buyer resells a property quickly for a profit, is on the decline as U.S. residential price gains slow and foreclosures dwindle.\nSales of $750,000 to $1 million provided the best return, at an average 41 percent, RealtyTrac said."}
