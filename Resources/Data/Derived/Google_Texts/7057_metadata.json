(WANE) \u2013 When mass shootings happen in public places, people are left asking why. Why would someone go into a school or movie theater or mall and shoot strangers? Investigators, lawmakers, analysts and the media search for somewhere to place the blame and find a way to prevent the tragedies from happening again.\n\nThat blame often lands on mental illness.\n\nReports suggest that in the mass shootings in the United States since 1970, around 60 percent of the perpetrators showed symptoms of depression, delusions, and paranoia, according to an article in the American Journal of Public Health.\n\n\u201c[Society] always wants to ascribe a mental illness to people who do pretty depraved things,\u201d Dr. Stephen Ross, a clinical and forensic psychologist, said.\n\nLinking mental illness as a root cause of mass shootings is oversimplifying it, though, and it can be misleading.\n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to say is those with mental illnesses are more likely to commit violent acts. In fact, that\u2019s not the case,\u201d Ross said.\n\nA 2001 study of 34 adolescent mass murderers found most were described as loners and abused drugs or alcohol, around half were bullied and fantasied about violence, but only 23 percent had a documented psychiatric history. Only six percent were deemed psychotic when they committed their crime.\n\n\u201cThere are some folks who have done mass shootings who have killed people,\u201d Ross said. \u201cThey may not be mentally ill, but they\u2019re socially and morally depraved. It\u2019s evil. Evil in its truest form.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s estimated only three to five percent of violent acts are committed by someone with a serious mental illness. A person suffering from a mental illness is also more likely to become a victim of violence than they are to commit a violent act.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a very small section of people with mental illness who have gone out and been violent to other people,\u201d Ted Coburn, the president of the National Alliance on Mental Illness(NAMI) Fort Wayne, said. \u201cIf you have a serious mental illness, you\u2019re more likely to hurt yourself than another person.\u201d\n\nEvery year the number of suicides far outnumber the homicides in the United States. Coburn said there are usually around 15,000 homicides nationwide compared to 35,000 suicides. Some organizations cite as many as 41,000 suicides a year. In Allen County, so far this year, there have been 28 homicides and 36 suicides. Research from NAMI showed 90 percent of people who commit suicide had a mental illness.\n\n\u201cPeople do get better, but there needs to be help,\u201d Coburn said.\n\nLast year, one in five American adults had some kind of mental health issue. One in 25 lived with a serious mental illness like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depression.\n\nGetting help and treatment, Coburn said, sometimes is a challenge. He said that while around 80 percent of people with a serious mental illness do find their way to treatment, in some cases, it takes up to a decade to get there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have people come in when they\u2019re 16 and this has been going on for ten years and nothing was done about it,\u201d Dr. Ross concurred.\n\nLisa Smith, the executive director for Mental Health America Allen County, said there are opportunities for people to get help, but the system is sometimes fragmented.\n\n\u201cPart of that has to do with the fact that we don\u2019t have enough resources. Look at funding cuts,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf you look at the funding cuts at the federal and state level in the last decade, you can see why we\u2019re not always working smoothly to get people into services and help maintain their services.\u201d\n\nThe funding cuts eliminated a lot of long-term care facilities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fortunate in our community to have as many resources as we do, but there\u2019s still not enough funding to serve all the folks who are struggling,\u201d Smith said.\n\nTHERE\u2019S A LIST OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE AGENCIES AND RESOURCES AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS STORY.\n\nCommunity-based treatment and counseling does work for many people, but Coburn said that\u2019s not always enough.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the cheap way to do it. We don\u2019t have a lot of money to do it and these health care centers are trying to work in a certain budget,\u201d he said. \u201cI have met people who needed that longer term care and got better and came back to the community and did wonderful. Sometimes we can get someone in the hospital for one, two, three maybe four days, but that\u2019s not always enough time to make sure medicines are working correctly or to see stability in a person\u2019s mood. We need a long-term care option for some people.\u201d\n\nThose facilities do still exist, but the availability is a lot lower than demand.\n\n\u201cThe whole level of ability to care for enough people who are struggling doesn\u2019t equal up. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re incarcerating people. They\u2019re in prison and that has become our long-term care for people with mental illness and that\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d Smith said.\n\nCrisis Intervention Team (CIT) officers in Fort Wayne try to prevent that. They can often work out a situation with someone and get that person help instead of taking them to jail. NAMI and other organizations worked to develop that team more than a decade ago.\n\n\u201cFort Wayne CIT goes to about 1,200 calls a year and a third are suicide-related. CIT officers help calm people down and save their lives and take them to a hospital for evaluation. A very small percentage go to prison,\u201d Coburn said.\n\nWhile mental illness has a wide range of disorders, conditions and severity, and the treatments are not \u201cone size fits all,\u201d the vast majority of cases are treatable and manageable.\n\n\u201cWe need accurate, early diagnosis and then the patients have to be compliant with treatment,\u201d Dr. Ross said. \u201cParents need to be aware and recognize there could be something going on with their child and get some help.\u201d\n\nCoburn would like to see a better way for people with concerns to get help.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do? Call 911 and say my son likes Nazi themes? The terminology to get someone committed is an imminent threat to themselves or others. There\u2019s just no easy way in our system right now to say that I perceive a threat,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother barrier to people seeking help is the stigma surrounding a mental health condition.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all affected by it and we need to be better at understanding it and accepting it as a normal course of our life,\u201d Smith said.\n\nThat leads to a lot of people going undiagnosed.\n\n\u201cThere are folks walking about and they\u2019re anxious or depressed and not getting treatment because they\u2019re managing it,\u201d Dr. Ross said.\n\nBut, just as not diagnosing and treating a heart condition is unhealthy, so is not diagnosing and treating a mental health condition.\n\n\u201cHow do we get treatment that\u2019s affordable, accessible and acceptable? That\u2019s where we need to start. It doesn\u2019t matter if we\u2019re talking about a violent act or the health and well-being of an individual. We need to make sure people can get access to care,\u201d Smith said.\n\nWhile working on this story, 15 Finds Out discovered a new task force in Allen County is working to make getting that care easier and more streamlined.\n\nClick here to take online screening tests for several different mental illnesses.\n\nCrisis Lines:\n\nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline: (800) 272-TALK (8255)\n\nMental Health America Crisis Line: Text CSIS to 85511\n\nTrevor Project (LGBTQ youth and young adults): (866) 488-7386\n\nLocal Resources:\n\nSTOP Suicide Northeast Indiana: (260) 422-6441\n\nMental Health America in Allen County: (260) 422-6441\n\nMental Health and Addiction Services:\n\nBowen Center: (800) 342-5653\n\nHeadwaters Counseling: (260) 744-4326\n\nPark Center: (260) 481-2700\n\nParkview Behavioral Health: (800) 284-8439\n\nSt. Joseph Behavioral Health: (260) 425-3606\n\nNortheastern Center: (800) 790-0118\n\nNational Resources:\n\nAmerican Association of Suicidology: (202) 237-2280\n\nAmerican Foundation for Suicide Prevention: (888) 333-AFSP (2377)\n\nLifeline for Suicide Attempt Survivors and Families\n\nSociety for the Prevention of Teen Suicide: (732) 410-7900\n\nSuicide Prevention Resource Center\n\nHelpful Websites and Apps:\n\nSuicide Safety Plan (Mood Tools) \u2013 printable version here\n\nMy3 Support Network (CALMHSA)\n\nVirtual Home Box (T2)\n\nNow Matters Now (online program)\n\nBeating the Blues (online program)\n\n(Resource list provided by MHA Allen County)\n\nCopyright 2015 WANE.com", "article_metadata": {"bing-site-verification": "23CDEE3A27AFAAFA06AA97D2752E7BC3", "news_keywords": "mental illness, murder, terrorism, health, ill, social, link, attack, tragedy, shooting, violence", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wwlp", "og": {"site_name": "WWLP.com", "description": "Linking mental illness as a root cause of mass shootings is oversimplifying it, and it can be misleading.", "title": "Mental illness link to mass violence", "url": "http://wwlp.com/2015/11/19/mental-illness-link-to-mass-violence-misleading/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://lintvwwlp.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/mental-illness.jpg", "height": 366}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Linking mental illness as a root cause of mass shootings is oversimplifying it, and it can be misleading.", "title": "Mental illness link to mass violence", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwwlp.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/mental-illness.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WWLP22News", "site": "WWLP22News", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Western Massachusetts Breaking News, Weather", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488537620", "fb": {"pages": 16780999098}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wwlp.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/82beb0f66fcee4174912ea30f52087cc?s=16", "application-name": "WWLP.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WWLP22News", "published_time": "2015-11-19T08:00:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-19T08:00:59+00:00"}, "keywords": "breaking news, weather, investigative reports, springfield news, chicopee news, northampton news, amherst news, greenfield news, hampshire county, hampden county, berkshires, Connecticut river valley, pioneer valley, westfield news, western massachusetts, national news, headlines, online, nbc news", "google-site-verification": "6YJPKhiEei9MITNyJe-rDmtJtJ8OhKZ_QWocROYaWIU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Linking mental illness as a root cause of mass shootings is oversimplifying it, and it can be misleading."}, "article_summary": "Linking mental illness as a root cause of mass shootings is oversimplifying it, though, and it can be misleading.\nA person suffering from a mental illness is also more likely to become a victim of violence than they are to commit a violent act.\nEvil in its truest form.\u201dIt\u2019s estimated only three to five percent of violent acts are committed by someone with a serious mental illness.\nOne in 25 lived with a serious mental illness like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depression.\nTHERE\u2019S A LIST OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE AGENCIES AND RESOURCES AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS STORY."}
