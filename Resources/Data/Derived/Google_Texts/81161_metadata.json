Clarke Jr. is not a subtle guy, especially when he's angry.\n\nAnd he was quite upset on Thursday night about a Politico profile of New York Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton with the headline: \"Bratton once saved New York from criminals. Now can he save it from the police?\"\n\nClarke took to Twitter to make his point.\n\n\"Oh stop yourself already Politico,\" he tweeted. \"NYC without NYPD would resemble this.\"\n\nAttached was an incredibly graphic photo of the charred bodies of Nigerians killed by Boko Haram fighters earlier this year. Here is a link to the picture, but remember that it is very gruesome.\n\nBy Friday night, more than 100 people had retweeted the photo, and nearly as many had given it \"favorite\" status.\n\nIn addition, several individuals contacted the Journal Sentinel objecting to Clarke's tweet.\n\nThe sheriff's response?\n\nAgain, not very subtle.\n\n\"Why are people complaining to you?\" Clarke asked. \"What are you supposed to be able to do about it? Reply to them that I do not report to you, and they should complain to me directly or my father. Tell them you are NOT my father. Out of love and respect I still feel answerable to him as an intermediary.\"\n\nA few hours later, he got back with a more measured response.\n\n\"That's what happens when government institutions collapse,\" Clarke said.\n\n\"Look how much mayhem happens in American ghettos WITH police. Imagine without. I just showed it,\" he continued. \"Why is the US doing nothing about the genocide occurring in Africa? I thought black lives mattered?\"\n\nNow you know.\n\nBut be forewarned the next time you scroll through the sheriff's Twitter feed.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Sheriff David Clarke posts graphic photo to protest Politico story", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/295433911.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/js-for-social-200-final.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "description": "Milwaukee County Sheriff David A.
