She also pointed out that her son-in-law is from Philadelphia.\n\nThen she went straight into the stump speech, and she came out firing on every issue. Unlike the fervor on the other side of the aisle, Hillary refused to attack her primary opponent, Senator Bernie Sanders.\n\nShe did however take shots at Donald Trump, Texas Senator Ted Cruz and even former President George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cThe economy does better with Democrats,\u201d she asserted. \u201cPresident Obama does not get the credit he deserves for getting out of the debt that Republicans gave us.\u201d\n\nHillary moved on to other issues, including protecting Planned Parenthood, and ensuring a woman\u2019s right to choose.\n\nShe moved onto the Affordable Care Act, where she explained, \u201cnot only do I want to defend the ACA, I want to expand on it. I want to lower copays, lower deductibles and lower prescription drug costs.\u201d\n\nShe then referenced her event earlier that day, in which she talked with a couple parents who had lost their children to gun violence.\n\n\u201cGuns kill 33,000 a year. If there was a disease that was killing 33,000 a year, we would all be working together to find a cure.\u201d\n\nFor her final issue, she decided to mock Trump and Cruz for their lack of foreign policy experience and expertise.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim emigrants drew lots of boos from the crowd, to which Hillary laughed. For Cruz, she pointed to how dangerous his idea to have police patrol Muslim neighborhoods would be, quoting the NYC police commissioner, \u201cTed Cruz has no idea what the heck he is talking about.\u201d\n\nThe crowd roared when they heard that, and Hillary ended the speech by exclaiming that \u201cour best days are most certainly ahead of us.\u201d\n\nAt the exits, Bernie Sanders supporters chanted \u201cFeel the Bern\u201d, to the dismay of many Clinton supporters.\n\nHowever, Pennsylvania may not be feeling the Bern come April 26th. Clinton has a 13 point lead according to the latest Monmouth Poll.\n\nApril 22nd, 2016 | Posted in Front Page Stories, Presidential, Top Stories | 7 Comments", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Democratic front-runner rocked the crowd at the Fillmore.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.11", "og": {"url": "http://www.politicspa.com/hillary-rallies-in-philadelphia/74723/", "image": "http://www.politicspa.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Hillary-Philly-300x199.png", "type": "article", "description": "The Democratic front-runner rocked the crowd at the Fillmore.", "title": "Hillary Rallies in Philadelphia"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 775768999125308}, "keywords": "presidential,hillary clinton,philadelphia,bernie sanders,ted cruz,donald trump,democratic primary,2016 election", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2403\"", "article_summary": "Hillary Rallies in PhiladelphiaWritten by Chris Calabrese, Contributing WriterWith flags flying and \u201cFighting for us\u201d signs everywhere, Hillary Clinton returned to Philadelphia.\nShe did however take shots at Donald Trump, Texas Senator Ted Cruz and even former President George W.
