He spent 15 years in the Philippines as a missionary, where he met his wife, Abbie.\n\nThe two got married in 2002. Barth and Abbie Bracy reside in Dayville, Conn., with their four young sons, whom she home-schools throughout the year. Bracy commutes 45 minutes to his job as executive director of Rhode Island Right to Life. He also is a deacon at a local church in Connecticut.\n\nBracy, 47, says he never imagined the family would have to go without health insurance\u2014or that he would find himself in a high-stakes lawsuit against the federal government.\n\n\u2018If You Like Your Plan, You Can Keep It\u2019\n\nOn Oct. 25, 2013, Barth received a letter from his insurance company, Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield, saying the family\u2019s health insurance didn\u2019t comply with the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. On Dec. 1, 2014, the plan would be canceled.\n\n\u201cWe were one of those families who liked their plan and wanted to keep it,\u201d Bracy told The Daily Signal in a telephone interview.\n\nThe cost to the Bracy family was $494.31 a month, he says, and it wasn\u2019t one of those \u201cjunk plans,\u201d either.\n\nSkeptical, Bracy began navigating his state\u2019s online Obamacare insurance exchange, Access Health CT. He considered himself an \u201ceducated user\u201d of the system because he had been involved in fighting aspects of Obamacare since 2009 with Rhode Island Right to Life.\n\nHis first priority after receiving his Anthem Blue Cross/Blue Shield cancellation notice was to find a plan that didn\u2019t subsidize abortion.\n\n\u201cGod is the center of our individual and family lives,\u201d he says of the family\u2019s pro-life views.\n\nIn a 2009 speech, President Obama promised Congress and the American people: \u201c[U]nder our plan, no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions.\u201d\n\n>>> Read More: Conservatives Decry Obama\u2019s Hidden Abortion Coverage\n\nSince a number of plans on the Obamacare exchanges received federal tax credits, it stood to reason that finding one that didn\u2019t pay for elective abortions would be possible.\n\nGiven Bracy\u2019s knowledge of what would become the Affordable Care Act, however, he could have predicted the president\u2019s statement would turn out to be a sham. In fact, last fall he did just that.\n\n\u2018Worse Than We Imagined\u2019\n\nIn an Oct. 13 press release for Rhode Island Right to Life, Bracy warned against what he called Obamacare\u2019s \u201cmandatory abortion fees.\u201dHe was referring to a surcharge of at least one dollar each month that insurers offering abortion coverage must collect from enrollees.\n\nThe \u201cfact-checking\u201d media organization Politifact judged Bracy\u2019s statement to be only \u201chalf true.\u201d\n\nLast week, though, a report by the Government Accountability Office confirmed Bracy\u2019s account, revealing that more than 1,000 Obamacare plans cover abortion while remaining eligible for tax subsidies.\n\n>>> Commentary: How Obamacare Forces You to Subsidize Plans That Cover Elective Abortion\n\nThe GAO report also found that some insurers failed to collect from policyholders a required separate payment for abortion coverage. That requirement was the government\u2019s attempt to keep tax dollars, as Obama promised, from directly funding abortion.\n\n\u201cEvery individual or family who enrolls in an Obamacare plan that covers abortion will pay at least one dollar every month that can fund elective abortions,\u201d says Sarah Torre, a policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation who closely follows the issue of Obamacare and abortion.\n\nIn examining five states\u2014including Rhode Island and Connecticut\u2014the GAO report found no health insurance options for citizens who object to paying for elective abortions.\n\n\u201cNobody saw that coming,\u201d Bracy says. \u201cIt\u2019s become even worse than we imagined.\u201d\n\nHe adds:\n\nIt\u2019s the evil genius of the way this law was created that you have people who would be horrified to find out they\u2019re writing $12 checks every year that go to funding [other] people\u2019s abortions\u2014and that\u2019s exactly what the government is doing.\n\n\u2018Incompetence\u2019 or \u2018Malice\u2019?\n\nAnother problem highlighted by the GAO report\u2014which also studied New Jersey, Vermont and Hawaii\u2014is the lack of transparency on abortion subsidies in insurance plans.\n\nOf 18 insurance issuers interviewed, 11 admitted that customers shopping for plans on state exchanges \u201cdo not have access to such information.\u201d A consumer might be able to call an information number or dig through a website to find the answer, the insurers said, but there is no guarantee the consumer will find out before buying a plan.\n\nBracy, who considers himself better informed than the average citizen regarding abortion coverage in Obamacare, gives this account of how difficult finding the information can be:\n\nFirst, he sifted through the \u201c\u201dSummary of Benefits and Coverage\u201d in all three of Connecticut\u2019s health insurance options. There, he didn\u2019t come across a single piece of information pertaining to abortion coverage or subsidies.\n\nBracy had to open \u201cDetailed Plan\u201d documents, more than 100 pages long, to find the information he was looking for. He then discovered that Connecticut options don\u2019t include a single plan without a subsidy for elective abortion, as highlighted in the GAO report.\n\n>>> Commentary: Forcing Individuals and Taxpayers to Fund Elective Abortion Coverage\n\nIn the \u201cDetailed Plan\u201d documents he examined, Bracy says, not once was the term \u201cabortion\u201d used. Instead, buried deep in the files, he found information on \u201ctermination of pregnancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether it was incompetence or malice, I can\u2019t say \u2026 but Obamacare almost didn\u2019t pass because of the abortion issue\u2014everyone in the country knows that,\u201d he says.\n\nThis is clearly something [the Obama administration] was aware is a great interest to an awful lot of people, so it\u2019s one of the things they [insurers] obviously should have made very clear in the \u2018Summary of Benefits and Coverage.\u2019\n\nTorre, the Heritage analyst, agrees that Obamacare isn\u2019t transparent about the abortion fee:\n\nObamacare regulations only allow insurers to disclose the existence and amount of the abortion surcharge at the time of enrollment. Those shopping for an abortion-free health plan will have a very difficult time figuring out which plans on the exchange include coverage of elective abortion before they enroll.\n\nMany pro-life Americans call this Obamacare\u2019s \u201csecrecy clause,\u201d and they accuse the government of making insurers hide the ball when it comes to coverage of life-terminating procedures.\n\nNot for a Million Dollars\n\nTechnically, the Bracys have three options:\n\nBuy a plan on Connecticut\u2019s Obamacare exchange and pay only $2 or $3 per month after tax credits, but be forced to subsidize abortions. For anyone devoted to the pro-life cause, Barth says, it\u2019s \u201csimply not an option\u201d even if the government offered \u201cone million dollars.\u201d Purchase a plan on the free market with coverage comparable to their current, $494-a-month Blue Cross/Blue Shield insurance and pay upward of $900 per month, which Bracy says is \u201ccompletely unaffordable for our family.\u201d Go uninsured and pay the government fine.\n\n\u201cEven if it\u2019s only one dollar that I have to pay, I just cannot take a dollar out of my pocket and give it to somebody knowing it\u2019s going to go to pay for somebody else\u2019s abortions,\u201d he says, adding:\n\nThat makes me directly complicit in that abortion. I can\u2019t do that, even if I weren\u2019t a pro-life or Catholic leader, my conscience says you cannot participate in the taking of a human life, period\u2013no matter what.\n\nBracy isn\u2019t only contemplating the risks in going uninsured. Without health insurance for the family as of Dec. 1, he worries that he and his wife could be accused of being bad parents.\n\nSuck It Up\u2014or Sue\n\nSome people tell Bracy to just suck it up. \u201cIt\u2019s temporary,\u201d they say.\n\nBy 2017, Obamacare requires Connecticut and the rest of the states to offer at least one \u201cmulti-state plan\u201d that doesn\u2019t subsidize abortion.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t provide much comfort, Bracy says:\n\nWhat if that plan doesn\u2019t work for you? The government is treating pro-lifers as second-class citizens who don\u2019t deserve access to good health care.\n\nIn May, Bracy filed suit against the federal and state governments in U.S. District Court in Connecticut, citing the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, its equivalent in state law and the free exercise clause of the First Amendment.\n\nHe argues that those laws prohibit the government from enforcing Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate requiring the Bracys to buy insurance\u2014or withholding benefits under the Affordable Care Act because the Bracys decline to pay the abortion surcharge levied against everyone who picks a plan on the Connecticut exchange.\n\nIn the same suit, the Bracys brought a free speech challenge to the \u201csecrecy\u201d provisions of Obamacare that forbid insurers from telling customers upfront whether plans cover abortion and how much they are paying for others\u2019 abortions.\n\n>>> Commentary: Don\u2019t Buy the Lie That Freedom of Worship Is the Same as Religious Freedom\n\nEvery chance he gets, Bracy asks others to join him in the fight against the abortion fee, especially encouraging fellow pro-lifers to \u201cnot back down.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn those five states\u2014Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Vermont and Hawaii\u2014the reality is every person with an Obamacare exchange plan is paying for abortions,\u201d Casey Mattox, a lawyer at Alliance Defending Freedom who represents the Bracys, says in an interview with The Daily Signal.\n\nMattox adds:\n\nIt isn\u2019t disclosed in your bill, but the insurer is charging you a separate fee and is required by the law to use that amount solely to pay for others\u2019 elective abortions. Knowing Americans would be outraged by this, Obamacare\u2019s architects required the insurers to hide this truth in your bill. But as terrible as taxpayer-funded abortions are, for citizens in those states the reality is even worse.\n\n\u2018Ignorance Is Bliss\u2019\n\n\u201cI suppose ignorance is bliss,\u201d Bracy says of the millions of pro-life Americans who potentially don\u2019t know that through their health insurance plans, they\u2019re paying for abortions.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s tragic is that people don\u2019t know because they\u2019re being lied to,\u201d he says.\n\nMattox says the government is required to issue a response to the Bracys by Oct. 13, just before Obamacare open enrollment for 2015 begins in November.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope that the state and federal governments will stop punishing pro-life families for their refusal to pay for others\u2019 abortions and give them an opportunity to obtain health insurance without compromising their convictions,\u201d the family\u2019s lawyer says, adding:\n\nThe Bracys will not surrender their conscience even if it means going without health insurance. Hopefully the federal and state officials comply with their obligations under the law, and it does not come to that.\n\nLifeNews Note: Kelsey Harkness writes for The Daily Signal, where this column originally appeared.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Family of Six Says They\u2019ll Go Uninsured Before Paying Obamacare\u2019s \"Abortion Fee\"", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Barth Bracy has devoted his life to his Catholic faith.
