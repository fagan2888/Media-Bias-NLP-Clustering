About 5,000 people attended the march, according to the Sierra Club\u2019s Mark Westlund \u2014 making it the largest anti-tar sands march the Midwest has ever seen.\n\nThe main goal of the protest was to emphasize that the conversation about tar sands and fossil fuels was about more than just the Keystone XL pipeline, McKibben said on a press call in the leadup to the march.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone way way way beyond Keystone,\u201d he said. \u201cThat one got the attention\u2026but the beautiful result has been the \u2018Keystonization\u2019 of pretty much every pipeline company across the country.\u201d\n\n\n\nOver 5k people here for the Tar Sands Resistance!! #stoptarsands #powershift pic.twitter.com/zlihM2hDNJ \u2014 Energy Action (@energyaction) June 6, 2015\n\n\n\n5,000 pipeline fighters standing up for a just future free of fossil fuels!

Pipeline company Enbridge is in the process of increasing capacity of Alberta Clipper, which carries tar sands from Hardisty, Alberta to Superior, Wisconsin, from 450,000 to 570,000 barrels per day, with the ultimate goal of increase the pipeline\u2019s capacity to 880,000 bpd \u2014 more than the capacity of Keystone XL.\n\nMcKibben said he hopes the protest in St. Paul will bring more attention to these other pipeline projects, which are being proposed all over the country.\n\n\u201cThis fight expanded beyond Keystone almost immediately. People have been fighting other pipelines with great power,\u201d he said. \u201cThe press hasn\u2019t payed as much attention because it hasn\u2019t involved presidential politics in the same way as Keystone has\u2026We hope this rally will help bring things front and center.\u201d\n\nAaron Mair, president of the Sierra Club, said that the march will help drive home to President Obama just how much opposition there is to tar sands in the U.S.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s march and rally are sending a clear message to the president and his administration: this nation doesn\u2019t want or need dirty fuels from Canada\u2019s tar sands,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to keep our air and water clean, cut climate pollution, and protect Tribal and farming communities here and in Canada, we must ultimately keep tar sands oil in the ground. The president cannot ignore us because the movement demanding clean energy solutions to the climate crisis is growing stronger and more diverse.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The main goal of the protest was to emphasize that the conversation about tar sands and fossil fuels is about more than just the Keystone XL pipeline.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The main goal of the protest was to emphasize that the conversation about tar sands and fossil fuels is about more than just the Keystone XL pipeline.", "title": "Thousands March In The Midwest\u2019s Largest-Ever Anti-Tar Sands Rally", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/06/06/3666931/tar-sands-midwest-rally/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/photo-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The main goal of the protest was to emphasize that the conversation about tar sands and fossil fuels is about more than just the Keystone XL pipeline.", "creator": "@KatieRValentine", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/photo-1-320x213.jpg", "title": "Thousands March In The Midwest\u2019s Largest-Ever Anti-Tar Sands Rally", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-climate", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/photo-1.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/photo-1.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-06T14:53:47+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/katiervalentine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Climate Thousands March In The Midwest\u2019s Largest-Ever Anti-Tar Sands Rally CREDIT: courtesy of the Sierra Club Protesters march against tar sands oil in St. Paul, MN on Saturday, June 6, 2015.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone way way way beyond Keystone,\u201d he said.\n#StopTarSands pic.twitter.com/8T3PBJjpX1 \u2014 Rob Friedman (@BobbyHertz) June 6, 2015Tar sands fighters fill the streets of St. Paul as far as the eye can see!\nThousands gathered in St. Paul, Minnesota Saturday afternoon to march in protest of the growing network of tar sands pipelines in America, singling out one pipeline \u2014 the Alberta Clipper \u2014 in particular.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to keep our air and water clean, cut climate pollution, and protect Tribal and farming communities here and in Canada, we must ultimately keep tar sands oil in the ground."}
