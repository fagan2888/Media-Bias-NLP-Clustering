In addition to bigger houses, Americans are installing more toilets in their homes; in some cases, there are more toilets than inhabitants.\n\nAccording to the data, a third of all houses built last year had at least three toilets, even though the mean U.S. household has somewhere between two or three people living in it. \u201cThey know what they want, and they can afford it right now,\u201d John Johnson, chief executive of builder David Weekley Homes, told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cSo they\u2019re tricking out their houses. They\u2019re putting all kinds of upgrades in \u2014 the nice cabinets, the spa-type tubs in the master bathroom.\u201d\n\nMore Toilets, More Problems?\n\nHopefully an increase in toilets in American homes isn\u2019t going to cause extra problems for sewage, which has already seen clogged sewer problems rise in the past four years, according to the National Association of Clean Water Agencies. However, this may have more to do with flushing faux pas than toilets themselves: People who toss flushable moist toilettes \u2014 or other items like paper towels, feminine products, or baby wipes \u2014 into their toilets are most likely contributing to sewer system problems. So though there may be bigger and more toilets in this world, don\u2019t get too careless with what you\u2019re throwing in there.\n\nBut an increase in toilets might be associated with a bigger problem. Even if they're fancy ones that have heated seats, more toilets in your home isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing in the big scheme of things. In fact, sanitation experts have been trying to figure out a way to phase out toilets for years because, quite frankly, they can be wasteful in terms of water. \u201c[T]he flushing loo \u2014 that human innovation that lifted the industrialized world out of its own dirt, cholera and dysentery \u2014 is quickly becoming one of the more egregrious instruments of waste in this time of acutely finite resources,\u201d Don Duncan of TIME writes.\n\nThe EPA also states that toilets account for up to 30 percent of indoor water consumption in U.S. households \u2014 especially older ones. Indeed, the flush can be a wasteful action \u2014 a toilet can use up to 22 liters of drinking water every day, with every flush containing about three to six liters. It \u201cunnecessarily increases the volume of our waste and the cost of its transportation and treatment,\u201d Duncan writes.\n\nMore toilets means more maintenance; according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), leaking problems are likely to occur in faucets, showerheads, and of course, toilets. And toilet leaks can cause up to 1.25 trillion gallons of water loss per year, a number equivalent to the amount of water used in L.A., Chicago, and Miami combined.\n\n\u201cThe world can\u2019t sustain this toilet,\u201d Jack Sim, founder of the World Toilet Organization, told TIME. \u201cThis \u2018flush and forget\u2019 attitude creates a new problem which we have to revisit.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "toilets in american homes, sanitation", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "New data shows that in one third of American houses, there are at least three toilets \u2014 often surpassing the number of people living there.", "title": "Growing Number Of American Houses Have More Toilets Than People", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/along-even-bigger-houses-americans-are-putting-record-numbers-toilets-their-homes-286964", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/toilet.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New data shows that in one third of American houses, there are at least three toilets \u2014 often surpassing the number of people living there.", "title": "Growing Number Of American Houses Have More Toilets Than People", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/along-even-bigger-houses-americans-are-putting-record-numbers-toilets-their-homes-286964", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/toilet.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/toilet.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-06T17:35:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-06T17:35:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "New data shows that in one third of American houses, there are at least three toilets \u2014 often surpassing the number of people living there."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e44\"", "article_summary": "In addition to bigger houses, Americans are installing more toilets in their homes; in some cases, there are more toilets than inhabitants.\n\u201cThe world can\u2019t sustain this toilet,\u201d Jack Sim, founder of the World Toilet Organization, told TIME.\nThey\u2019re putting all kinds of upgrades in \u2014 the nice cabinets, the spa-type tubs in the master bathroom.\u201dMore Toilets, More Problems?\nA new Census Bureau report reveals that Americans are building houses that are bigger than ever before \u2014 with a record 44 percent of new homes containing four or more bedrooms.\nSo though there may be bigger and more toilets in this world, don\u2019t get too careless with what you\u2019re throwing in there."}
