For instance, if you run a business and a new regulation takes effect, you may no longer be able to make a profit. On the other hand, if you try a new marketing device, like banner ads, and they fail to bring in business, this was your choice. You can\u2019t blame someone else.\n\nCalifornia, thanks to Obamacare and its exchange, Covered California, has no one to blame but itself. The state is imposing costly rules and regulations on the health care system, causing a death spiral in health care delivery.\n\nA friend of mine is taking care of her sick, elderly father. Until Covered California, she was paying $12 for a prescription for his heart problem. Covered California does not allow this medicine to be covered anymore, so she now pays over $400 every three months to keep her father alive.\n\nAdded to the higher costs for deductibles and medicine, you also have a California tax on insurance policies. Since 2008, California has collected a tax of 2.5 percent on all insurance policies. I should note that the tax is never broken out as part of the policy costs.\n\nThere are six other states that have a tax like this\u2014four do not have any income taxes, and the other two have much lower income taxes and lower health care taxes. This is one of the reasons California health care costs are among the highest in the nation.\n\nThere\u2019s another reason the California health care system could collapse: reimbursements for doctors accepting Medi-Cal patients have been cut by 60 percent as of January 1. There are 12.2 million Californians on Medi-Cal\u2014a doubling of the number in a year.\n\nThe formerly Golden State has 38 million people, meaning two-thirds of the people pay for the health care of the other third. How long can this continue?\n\nGov. Jerry Brown expects several more millions to be added. Worse, if the Obama amnesty is implemented, than over 1 million illegal aliens in California could become eligible for taxpayer-subsidized insurance.\n\nCalifornia Health Line noted that the rate cut could lead medical practices to insolvency:\n\n\u201cThe federal drop is much more precipitous, but it\u2019s the combination of the two rate decreases that has Francisco Silva concerned. Silva, vice president of legal affairs at the California Medical Association, said primary care providers who see a lot of Medi-Cal patients will have to scale back or stop seeing those beneficiaries. \u201cThat\u2019s about 60% less, when you combine both cuts,\u201d Silva said. \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned. It\u2019s really concerning for the sustainability of those practices with a large Medi-Cal patient base. When you look at the financial solvency data \u2026 there\u2019s a strong correlation between solvency and patient load.\u201d\n\nThe system is creating millions of patients, but reducing the number of doctors. We already have too few doctors, imagine how many more will drop out of the system when their already too low reimbursement is cut?\n\nHospitals are feeling the pinch, forcing several in Northern California to close due to financial distress. Now our rural residents have to go over 100 miles, instead of 20 to 25, to the nearest hospital. As of May 2014, eight California hospitals closed:\n\nTo that end, hospitals across California are facing $23 billion in payment cuts between now and 2023. Of that, $17 billion is related to the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s a tough road ahead for hospitals both large and small.\n\nLess doctors and fewer hospitals, all because of policies made by government, not the mistakes made by health care professionals.\n\nOn top of all that, you have the fraud perpetrated by Covered California. Last year, they approved several health care plans through insurance networks. At that time, you could go to the Covered California web site, see the plans, the doctors and the hospitals involved, and make a decision.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until after folks bought the policies, vetted by the government agency, that they found out Covered California used bait and switch tactics on them:\n\nCBS San Francisco reported the following:\n\nJulia Turner was caught in what she described as an \u2018insurance bait and switch.\u2019 In her research, she found that her doctor was listed as in-network on the Covered California provider directory. After signing up for the coverage, she found out otherwise. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t going to have access to my doctor, I would have chosen a different insurance,\u201d said Turner.\u201d\n\nCovered California failed to vet the insurance plans and ensure that information was correct. The state now has millions of citizens holding a medical card, but few doctors and hospitals willing to participate. The cost, when you include the taxes and high deductibles, has put quality care out of reach for many families.\n\nTo many, the card is worthless\u2014but expensive.\n\nNone of this is because of external issues or problems. This is a suicide for the people of California, created by the federal and state governments that seem more interested in providing large numbers of cards than ensuring quality care for their citizens.\n\nThis article was written by a contributor of Watchdog Arena, Franklin Center\u2019s network of writers, bloggers, and citizen journalists.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Covered California has no one to blame but itself.
