But no proof is required from Covered California customers, and insurers say that some have abused the process.\n\nThe Covered California board of directors is expected to vote on the proposal in April. If approved, it is expected to take effect in June.\n\n\u201cWe want people to enroll in special-enrollment periods. \u2026 We also have an obligation to make sure that people who enroll in special-enrollment periods qualify,\u201d said Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee at the agency\u2019s monthly board meeting.\n\nJohn Bertko, Covered California\u2019s chief actuary, said there are \u201ccredible indications\u201d that people who sign up during special enrollment have higher health costs than those who sign up during open enrollment. He believes the difference can be attributed partly to people who are gaming the system.\n\nUse Our Content This story can be republished for free ( details ).\n\nPlus, he said, the number of people who sign up during special enrollment is growing.\n\nUnless Covered California ensures that only those who are eligible qualify for special enrollment, premiums could go up an additional 2 percent to 5 percent, he estimated.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of action, we would be potentially facing higher rate increases in 2017,\u201d Lee said.\n\nObamacare created new enrollment rules for people who buy coverage from a health insurance exchange or the open market. Under the law, they can only sign up or switch plans during the annual open-enrollment period, which ended on Jan. 31 for 2016.\n\nBut if they experience one of those life events midyear, they will qualify for a special-enrollment period. Customers of Covered California currently don\u2019t have to prove they are eligible. They \u201cattest\u201d that a qualifying event occurred.\n\nUnder the proposal, consumers would have to show documentation \u2013- such as a marriage license or birth certificate. Health plans would forward the documentation to Covered California. If the health plans didn\u2019t receive documentation from consumers within 10 days, Covered California said it would reach out to give them another chance.\n\nChanging the policy could lead to 10 percent to 25 percent lower enrollment during special enrollment, Bertko said.\n\nBut consumer advocates opposed the proposal, saying they\u2019re not convinced there\u2019s a problem, especially because the data behind it is \u201cnot final or proven,\u201d as Lee said.\n\nThey believe requiring documentation will make insurance inaccessible to people who are eligible but have trouble proving it, especially immigrants and low-wage workers. For instance, they said, how can someone prove he was terminated from his minimum-wage job?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of evidence that reliance on paper documents will serve as a barrier to enrollment,\u201d said Michelle Lilienfeld, senior attorney at the National Health Law Program. \u201cThe documentation that will be required in many instances may not even exist.\u201d\n\nInsurers, however, voiced support.\n\nBill Wehrle of Kaiser Permanente said Kaiser data show that Covered California enrollees who sign up during special enrollment periods have \u201csignificantly higher utilization of medical care\u201d than those who sign up for comparable special enrollment periods in the private market, which requires documentation.\n\nAbout 20 percent of people who apply for a special-enrollment period in the private market are turned away because they can\u2019t document their eligibility, he said.\n\nOf those, he said, about 5 percent later sign up for Kaiser plans through Covered California special enrollment, where they aren\u2019t asked to show proof, he said.\n\nEarlier this year, the federal government tightened rules for special-enrollment periods available through the federal health insurance exchange, Healthcare.gov.\n\nAmong other things, it eliminated several circumstances that would trigger eligibility for special-enrollment periods, clarified special-enrollment rules for people who move, and warned that it may seek proof of eligibility from some consumers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Proposal would tighten requirements for midyear sign-ups, to deter people who don't enroll until they get sick.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "California Healthline", "description": "Proposal would tighten requirements for midyear sign-ups, to deter people who don\u2019t enroll until they get sick.", "title": "Covered California Takes Aim At System Gamers", "url": "http://californiahealthline.org/news/covered-california-takes-aim-at-system-gamers/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/kaiser-californiahealthline/static/images/placeholder.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CalHealthline", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CalHealthline"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://californiahealthline.org/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "application-name": "California Healthline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2016-02-19T13:08:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-19T16:16:39+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It may soon become harder to enroll in Covered California health plans outside the regular open-enrollment period.\nBut no proof is required from Covered California customers, and insurers say that some have abused the process.\nThe Covered California board of directors is expected to vote on the proposal in April.\nCovered California, the state health insurance exchange, wants to tighten the rules for special-enrollment periods by making consumers provide documentation proving they\u2019re eligible.\nOf those, he said, about 5 percent later sign up for Kaiser plans through Covered California special enrollment, where they aren\u2019t asked to show proof, he said."}
