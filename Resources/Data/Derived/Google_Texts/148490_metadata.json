And federal courts locally are about to run out of money to pay their 300 employees.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 It's been 10 days since the start of the government shutdown, and resolution appears as distant as ever. Neither Republicans in Congress nor President Barack Obama has given an inch.\n\nBut to U.S. Rep. John Mica, R-Winter Park, the temporary pain is worth it.\n\nHe is one of three GOP House members from Central Florida \u2014 along with Daniel Webster of Winter Garden and Bill Posey of Rockledge \u2014 who Obama says are part of a conservative bloc that has taken the government \"hostage\" to demands that are amorphous and changeable.\n\nMica said the hardball tactics are necessary to win concessions from the Democrat-controlled Senate and White House on issues ranging from defunding the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a demand the Republicans have largely abandoned \u2014 to unspecified cuts in Social Security, Medicare and other spending.\n\n\"What [other] leverage do you have?\" Mica asked.\n\nThough he said Republicans likely overreached in trying to defund \"Obamacare\" \u2014 \"maybe that was unrealistic,\" he says \u2014 the 11-term lawmaker dismissed Obama's suggestion that the two sides negotiate only after reopening federal offices and increasing the nation's debt limit, which is set to hit its cap next week.\n\n\"Ronald Reagan said, 'Trust but verify,'\" Mica said. \"Republicans would not have a chance [of getting what they wanted] once you get past next Wednesday or Thursday\" \u2014 the debt-ceiling deadline.\n\nBut when asked what he wanted, Mica was unspecific \u2014 other than some measure \"to bring spending under control.\"\n\n\"Right now, we have zero,\" he said. He added that he would \"probably not\" vote for an increase to the debt ceiling unless it included some cost-cutting measure, despite what economists and Wall Street have said is a potentially \"catastrophic\" risk to the U.S. economy if the government defaults on its debts.\n\n\"People sent us here for two reasons,\" he said: to cut spending and defund Obamacare.\n\nThough that approach has infuriated many Democrats, none of Central Florida's three House Republicans acknowledges much pressure from constituents to concede.\n\nAides to all three said phone calls and emails to their offices have split about evenly between callers advocating a \"stand your ground\" position and others demanding an end to the shutdown.\n\nPosey has been among the most resolute, demanding that any deal to reopen the government include a one-year delay in the Affordable Care Act's requirement that most Americans buy health insurance by Jan. 1. He argues that Obama gave a similar exemption to businesses.\n\nNow with the debt-ceiling fight in the mix, Posey said he wants \"another stab at passing a balanced-budget amendment,\" which would require the federal government to stay out of the red each year.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "news", "og": {"site_name": "tribunedigital-orlandosentinel", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 It's been 10 days since the start of the government shutdown, and resolution appears as distant as ever.
