The law and its enactment are fueling the cancellations of millions of policies across the country. Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on.\n\nThe Federal Register on June 17, 2010, noted an estimate that says \u201ca variety of studies indicate that between 40% and 67% of policies are in effect for less than one year,\u201d referring to individual policies that turn over.\n\nBut the Register went on to say that \u201cthe percentage of individual market policies losing grandfather status in a given year exceeds the 40% to 67% range.\u201d That means those policies will not be compliant with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and therefore won\u2019t be grandfathered because their cost-sharing items like co-payments are out of whack with the new law\u2019s standards.\n\nThe cancellations that will result from those discrepancies, as has been reported, could affect 10 million people in the individual market. Moreover, anywhere from 60.8 million to 107.6 million people covered by employer plans could also see their policies cancelled or changed because they don\u2019t comply with the new law, based on estimates from the Congressional Budget Office and the Federal Register.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFOX News analyst John Escherich dug deep into the Federal Register and government analysis about the law. Here\u2019s what he says: \u201cThe Administration knew that the grandfather rules they were writing, in combination with the standard and anticipated practices of insurance companies, would lead to millions upon millions of plans being canceled. And this was almost certainly the intention of the Administration all along. The law doesn\u2019t \u2018work\u2019 as it is intended to if millions of people are allowed to stay on grandfathered, non-ACA compliant insurance plans. The cancellations and changes to insurance plans were a natural and anticipated result of the ACA.\"\n\nTo date there is no delay in the individual mandate tax. Yet there have been delays and/or cancellations for items like the following: the employer mandate; the cap on out of pocket expenses; half of the law\u2019s deadlines; and income verification for tax credits.\n\nWhat\u2019s been doled out: more than 1,470 waivers for favored groups like unions; the preservation of subsidies for members of Congress in the exchanges; personal health insurance help for members of Congress, and more.\n\nThe irony is the law\u2019s enactment was loaded with trade-offs just like the law itself is built on trade-offs, meaning, healthier people are paying more in their insurance policies to help cover the sick uninsured. Insurance is not as affordable now as the Affordable Care Act proponents will have you believe, as premiums, deductibles and co-payments are spiking higher across the country.\n\nPhil Kerpen, president of American Commitment, nailed it when he said that the law enacts utopian benefits nobody can afford while uninsuring the insured. The health reform law mandates that people must buy coverage with essential benefits that they may not want or need, including maternity and newborn care or pediatric eyeglasses even if they are senior citizens.\n\nRemember this: on the millions of policies getting canceled in the individual market President Barack Obama said: \u201cEven if it's a small percentage of people. I mean, we're talkin' about 5% of the population.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/POLITICS/White House,/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE,/FOX BUSINESS/COLUMNS/Emac's Bottom Line", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-02 10:26:17 EST", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2013/12/04/new-obamacare-red-herring.html", "image": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/og-fox-business.png", "description": "Beware of a new argument from health reform backers that people are seeing policies canceled due to ordinary turnover in individual and small group plans.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The New Obamacare Red Herring"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX BUSINESS/POLITICS/White House\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/COLUMNS/Emac\\\\u0027s Bottom Line\"],\"author\":\"Elizabeth MacDonald\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"The New Obamacare Red Herring\",\"image_url\":\"http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/og-fox-business.png\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-04T16:10:26Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2013/12/04/new-obamacare-red-herring.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"06bb6aba-db8d-4040-99e4-5c8e250270b8\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "description": "Beware of a new argument from health reform backers that people are seeing policies canceled due to ordinary turnover in individual and small group plans.", "dc.description": "Beware of a new argument from health reform backers that people are seeing policies canceled due to ordinary turnover in individual and small group plans.", "dc.identifier": "06bb6aba-db8d-4040-99e4-5c8e250270b8", "og": {"site_name": "Fox Business", "description": "Beware of a new argument from health reform backers that people are seeing policies canceled due to ordinary turnover in individual and small group plans.", "title": "The New Obamacare Red Herring | Fox Business", "url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2013/12/04/new-obamacare-red-herring.html", "image": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/og-fox-business.png", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "classification-isa": "healthcare,ebottomline", "prism.channel": "fbn", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "politics", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.title": "The New Obamacare Red Herring", "dcterms.created": "2016-03-02 10:26:17 EST", "column": "emacs-bottom-line", "dcterms.abstract": "Beware of a new argument from health reform backers that people are seeing policies canceled due to ordinary turnover in individual and small group plans.", "dc.date": "2013-12-04", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX BUSINESS/POLITICS/White House\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/COLUMNS/Emac\\\\u0027s Bottom Line\"],\"author\":\"Elizabeth MacDonald\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"The New Obamacare Red Herring\",\"image_url\":\"http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/og-fox-business.png\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-04T16:10:26Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2013/12/04/new-obamacare-red-herring.html\",\"post_id\":\"06bb6aba-db8d-4040-99e4-5c8e250270b8\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "dc.creator": "Elizabeth MacDonald"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceeda\"", "article_summary": "The cancellations that will result from those discrepancies, as has been reported, could affect 10 million people in the individual market.\nThe cancellations and changes to insurance plans were a natural and anticipated result of the ACA.\"\nRemember this: on the millions of policies getting canceled in the individual market President Barack Obama said: \u201cEven if it's a small percentage of people.\nThe law and its enactment are fueling the cancellations of millions of policies across the country.\nThe law doesn\u2019t \u2018work\u2019 as it is intended to if millions of people are allowed to stay on grandfathered, non-ACA compliant insurance plans."}
