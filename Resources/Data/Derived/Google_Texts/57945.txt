The first ever Pepsi Gulf Coast Jam in Panama City Beach will be wrapping up Saturday.

Saturday morning, more than 15,000 tickets were sold to see musical acts on stages all across the beach.

Friday, Brantley Gilbert, Tracy Lawrence, and the Charlie Daniels Band performed with a headlining performance from Toby Keith.

Visitors are enjoying the food, the weather, and the music, but they're favorite part is meeting new people.

Gulf Coast Jam Visitor, Michael Palase, said, "We just met our new friends here. They are from Alabama and we met them here in line. We've been hanging out the three days just having a good old time."

Another Visitor Miranda Nash, said, "I mean we didn't expect it. We got on the shuttle and we met them and we've been spending every night with them and it's a really good time."

Saturday, the party continues with Darryl Worley, the Eli Young Band, and Toby Keith again at frank brown park.
