You get back out there, you get used to it, and sooner or later, it\u2019s exactly how it was.\u201d\n\nCarter has been one of the feel-good stories of the Broncos\u2019 offseason. After missing most of the past two seasons with a knee injury that required a microfracture procedure and strenuous rehabilitation to repair, Carter has been getting strong safety reps with the Broncos\u2019 first-string nickel defense. And with the Broncos giving T.J. Ward some rest Thursday, Carter got every rep on the base defense.\n\n\u201cRod Woodson told me today he had the same procedure and he played 14 years after that,\u201d Carter said, referring to the Hall of Fame defensive back who was a guest coaching instructor during the Broncos\u2019 minicamp. \u201cI\u2019ve been away from it for a while, just working. It is great to be out there and getting the opportunity and I\u2019m thankful for it.\u201d\n\nBehind the Broncos\u2019 practice fields, a new 85,000 square-foot indoor practice facility is getting stronger with iron every day. They should call it The House That Quinton Carter Built.\n\nSelected by the Broncos in the fourth round of the 2011 draft, Carter started 10 games as a rookie, then two more in the playoffs when he intercepted Ben Roethlisberger and Tom Brady in consecutive games.\n\nBut during a training camp practice down the street at a rented indoor sports bubble in 2012, Carter was covering Eric Decker on a deep pass thrown by some new quarterback named Peyton Manning.\n\nSo dysfunctional is the sports bubble for an NFL practice, Carter suffered a left knee and hamstring injury while trying to stop from ramming into a soccer goal. Two days later, he underwent arthroscopic surgery.\n\nIn fairness to the sports bubble and its unforgiving artificial surface, Carter had been playing with a degenerative cartilage condition in his knee since his college playing days at Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cIt did aggravate it,\u201d Carter said of his soccer goal twist. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but I am one of those who believes everything happens for a reason.\u201d\n\nHe played three games after his scope in 2012, but without cartilage, the pain became bone-on-bone unbearable. He underwent microfracture surgery in October, 2012, a more intensive procedure that requires a longer healing period, but also carries a greater chance of a permanent correction.\n\nThe Broncos must really think highly of Carter because they carried him on their injured reserve list for a second season in 2013.\n\n\u201cQuinton, having him back in the rotation, letting him get snaps and watching the way he is\u2014instinctive and makes plays, plays with confidence \u2014 it\u2019ll be a great addition to have him back at full strength,\u201d said Jack Del Rio, the Broncos\u2019 defensive coordinator.\n\n\u201cI made the decision to get it done because it was keeping me from playing the way I wanted to,\u201d Carter said. \u201cWhen I came to training camp last year it wasn\u2019t quite ready and I was thankful the Broncos kept me and put me on IR to keep working and get it better.\u201d\n\nMike Klis: mklis@denverpost.com or twitter.com/mikeklis", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos\u2019 Quinton Carter taking advantage of long-awaited return", "title": "Broncos\u2019 Quinton Carter taking advantage of long-awaited return", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/12/broncos-quinton-carter-taking-advantage-of-long-awaited-return/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140612__carterp1.jpg", "height": 456}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140612__carterp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-12T18:18:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:40:20+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt feels like a long time in one sense,\u201d Carter said Thursday after the Broncos\u2019 final minicamp practice.\nIt\u2019s been so long since Carter last played, Tim Tebow was the Broncos\u2019 starting quarterback.\nAnd with the Broncos giving T.J.
