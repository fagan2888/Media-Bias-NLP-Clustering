Referring to the federal government\u2019s appallingly incompetent response to the American Ebola outbreak, the front page headline next to the president\u2019s photo read, \u201cFor God\u2019s Sake, Get a Grip.\u201d\n\nAfter three weeks of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) happy talking its Ebola preparedness and wrist-flicking the potential threat, 3 people in America have been infected with Ebola, two nurses and the man they cared for \u2014 who died last week.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWe have also learned that the second nurse stricken with the deadly disease flew on a commercial airliner with 130-plus other passengers the day before she was diagnosed, and did so with the CDC\u2019s permission.\n\nArrogance and incompetence have so far defined the federal government\u2019s Ebola response. Wednesday President Obama canceled a fundraiser to reassure the public he was in charge. After the IRS, NSA, VA and ObamaCare launch, it\u2019s doubtful that will ease many minds.\n\nThe only good news to come out of the Ebola horror stories this week is that the CDC is sounding a little less smug.\n\nJohn Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "New York Daily News Blasts Obama: 'For God's Sake, Get a Grip'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "New York Daily News Blasts Obama: 'For God's Sake, Get a Grip'", "title": "New York Daily News Blasts Obama: 'For God's Sake, Get a Grip' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Journalism/2014/10/16/B0CO84vIMAAxPAI.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2014/10/16/new-york-daily-news-blasts-obama/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New York Daily News Blasts Obama: 'For God's Sake, Get a Grip'", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Journalism/2014/10/16/B0CO84vIMAAxPAI.jpg", "title": "New York Daily News Blasts Obama: 'For God's Sake, Get a Grip' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Journalism,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Journalism", "published_time": "2014-10-16T06:28:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Journalism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe leftwing New York Daily News blasted President Obama on its cover Thursday morning.\nArrogance and incompetence have so far defined the federal government\u2019s Ebola response.\nWednesday President Obama canceled a fundraiser to reassure the public he was in charge.\nThe only good news to come out of the Ebola horror stories this week is that the CDC is sounding a little less smug.\nAfter the IRS, NSA, VA and ObamaCare launch, it\u2019s doubtful that will ease many minds."}
