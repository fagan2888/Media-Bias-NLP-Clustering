Bernie Sanders\u2019s charade? Is it obligatory to take seriously his pose of being an \u201cindependent\u201d and a \u201csocialist\u201d? It gives excitable Democratic activists a frisson of naughtiness to pretend that he is both. Actually, he is neither.\n\n\u201cIndependent\u201d? He caucuses with Senate Democrats and attends their policy lunches, his committee assignments count against the Democrats\u2019 quota, he reliably votes with Democrats and he is seeking the Democrats\u2019 presidential nomination. He is a Democrat.\n\nIf he is a \u201csocialist,\u201d who isn\u2019t? In olden days, socialism meant something robust \u2014 government ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange. Then, voters and reality being resistant to such socialism, the idea was diluted to mean just government ownership of an economy\u2019s \u201ccommanding heights,\u201d principally heavy industries, coal mines, railroads, etc.\n\nIn 1928, even the U.S. Socialist Party\u2019s candidate, Norman Thomas (Princeton class of 1905), campaigned on a platform whose first plank was: \u201cNationalization of our natural resources, beginning with the coal mines and water sites, particularly at Boulder Dam and Muscle Shoals.\u201d Today, Boulder (now Hoover) Dam and Muscle Shoals are federal enterprises. The Socialist platform called for government ownership of the railroads. So far, the government\u2019s passenger rail monopoly, Amtrak, has accumulated $1.3 billion of red ink from 45 years of applied socialism.\n\nAmerica\u2019s Socialist Party did what Karl Marx said the state would do under communism: It withered away when the New Deal adopted much of its agenda of ameliorative government. Today, \u201csocialism,\u201d at least in Western Europe where the term is still part of the political lexicon, is the thin gruel of \u201csocial democracy.\u201d This means three things \u2014 heavy government regulation of commercial activities, government provision of a \u201csocial safety net\u201d and redistribution of wealth through progressive taxation and entitlement programs.\n\nFor America\u2019s Republicans, opposition to these three ubiquitous realities is avowed but not constraining. They neither plan nor pose a serious threat to any of the three, so they, too, can be called \u201csocialists,\u201d which is a classification that no longer classifies.\n\nIn 2008, conservatives got the vapors, or pretended to, when candidate Barack Obama, campaigning in Ohio, told Joe the Plumber (a.k.a. Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher), \u201cI think when you spread the wealth around, it\u2019s good for everybody.\u201d Histrionic conservatives exclaimed: Obama favors \u201credistribution of wealth\u201d! Which is most of what modern government does. And it does this even faster under Republicans than under Democrats.\n\nBetween 1960 and 2010, the growth of entitlement spending, which is redistributive, exploded from 28 percent to 66 percent of federal spending. For half a century, entitlement payments were, says economist Nicholas Eberstadt, America\u2019s \u201cfastest-growing source of personal income.\u201d And in any given year, growth \u201cwas on the whole over 8 percent higher if the president happened to be a Republican rather than a Democrat.\u201d\n\nAs Eberstadt has noted, America\u2019s welfare state transfers more than 14 percent of GDP to recipients. In 2010, government at all levels redistributed more than $2.2 trillion in money, goods and services to recipients. That is $7,200 per person, almost $29,000 for a family of four.\n\nDoes socialism mean government growing rapidly relative to the private sector? In the second half of the 20th century, government outlays and regulatory costs (primarily imposed on the private sector) grew 50 percent faster than the private sector. And the socialist Sanders thinks the public sector is famished?\n\nHectoring Hillary Clinton about her strategic reticence concerning most matters of public policy is unfair. She will tell us her convictions (about the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the Keystone XL pipeline, increasing Social Security benefits, etc.) when she decides, or is told, what her convictions are.\n\nWhile medical and retirement payments to the elderly swallow the federal budget, Sanders proposes increasing Social Security benefits (a regressive transfer to the most affluent age cohort, the elderly). He would pay for this by increasing the amount of income subject to payroll taxes. Campaigning in 2007, Clinton denounced such an increase as \u201ca trillion-dollar tax increase on the elderly and on middle-class workers.\u201d Under pressure from Sanders, her thinking about this may \u201cevolve.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a White House contender in 2016, is known for his stances on budget issues and war. Here's the Vermont senator's take on Obamacare, Social Security and more, in his own words. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)\n\nSanders, who thinks European social democracies are exemplary, evidently thinks America should be more like Greece. Clinton\u2019s other opponent, former Baltimore mayor and former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley, thinks America deserves more of what has made Baltimore so exciting \u2014 the unimpeded, full-throttle application (in Baltimore, for 48 years) of Democratic policies. Why should Clinton interrupt her reticence while her rivals are making her seem (relatively) sensible?\n\nDisclosure: This columnist\u2019s wife, Mari Will, works for Scott Walker.\n\nRead more from George F.
