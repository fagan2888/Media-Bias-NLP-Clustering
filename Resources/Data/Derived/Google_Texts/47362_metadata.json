(AP) - Packers defensive tackle Mike Daniels is looking for any edge to beat an opposing lineman.\n\nHis offensive-minded head coach is sharing some tips that Daniels may not have necessarily received before this offseason.\n\nCoach Mike McCarthy is relinquishing offensive play-calling duties this year to spend more time working with the defense and special teams.\n\nQuarterback Aaron Rodgers has even gone so far as to joke that McCarthy is sharing trade secrets with the defense.\n\nNot quite, but any little tidbit helps. McCarthy likes to keep things fresh for his team and coaching staff, after arriving in Green Bay in 2006.\n\n\u201cWell, a big focus for our whole team this year is just to raise the football IQ, so we\u2019ve had coaches spend more time together, offense and defense,\u201d McCarthy said Tuesday after the first day of the Packers\u2019 three-day mandatory minicamp.\n\nThis is still a work in progress for McCarthy. He appears to be spending more time away from the offense during open practices, but he doesn\u2019t have a routine down yet.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still kind of working through job responsibility. I\u2019ve got a lot of ideas that won\u2019t be applied until training camp and in-season,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cBut this is probably the busiest offseason for me personally, certainly since my first year here.\u201d\n\nDaniels, the Packers\u2019 high-energy leader on the line, has seen a difference. The defense already has veteran Dom Capers as its coordinator; now McCarthy is offering more insights to that side of the ball.\n\n\u201cI know being a defensive player, we\u2019re getting the offensive perspective. We\u2019re getting in their minds, pre-snap during a play,\u201d Daniels said about McCarthy\u2019s input.\n\nOne time this offseason when players were watching film, McCarthy pointed out differences in blocking schemes on back-to-back plays. The schemes looked exactly the same, but the offensive line, McCarthy noted, was trying to accomplish different goals on each play.\n\n\u201cAs Coach McCarthy pointed out, I think (it was) the guard (with) how he opened up his hips \u2026 it\u2019s so subtle,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cBut if you can get that subtle difference, you\u2019ll be able to read a play that much quicker.\u201d\n\nNot to say that McCarthy is completely divesting himself of the offense. This is his scheme, after all, even if Tom Clements is taking over calling plays. It sure helps that Rodgers, 31, is in the prime of his career.\n\nReceiver Randall Cobb said he hasn\u2019t really noticed that much of a difference on the field.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s more of the head man overseeing everything else. I\u2019m working with the same guys on a day-to-day basis,\u201d Cobb said.\n\nThe bigger adjustment is in meeting rooms, Cobb said. Besides Clements\u2019 promotion from offensive coordinator to associate head coach, McCarthy also promoted receivers coach Edgar Bennett to offensive coordinator.\n\nQuarterbacks coach Alex Van Pelt will add receivers coach to his responsibilities. Those position groups now meet in the same room.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s running what in meetings,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a difference that we\u2019re still working out the kinks to. I think it\u2019s been good so far just being able to be on the same page so far with the quarterback and understand what they\u2019re thinking and what they\u2019re seeing when they\u2019re watching film.\u201d\n\nNotes: Third-round draft pick Ty Montgomery didn\u2019t participate in his first workout until Thursday because the receiver was finishing school at Stanford. The workout Tuesday was just his third of the offseason, though McCarthy likes what he has seen so far. Playing catch-up, Montgomery said he had three goals. \u201cIt was to play fast, play with confidence \u2026 and then to finish every play. I still fell behind,\u201d he said. \u2026 The Packers have an offsite team-bonding event on Wednesday and will not practice. It\u2019s a tradition under McCarthy. \u201cThe opportunity that our players will have tomorrow, they\u2019ll be in groups of four, maybe five, and there\u2019ll be guys that ride in a (golf) cart with Aaron Rodgers or with someone they\u2019ve never really had a conversation with,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThis is about culture, it\u2019s about developing the bonding between your players and coaches and support staff. So it\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\n___\n\nOnline: AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "Packers defensive tackle Mike Daniels is looking for any edge to beat an opposing lineman.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Packers defensive tackle Mike Daniels is looking for any edge to beat an opposing lineman.", "title": "Mike McCarthy mixing it up in Packers camp", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/16/mike-mccarthy-mixing-it-up-in-packers-camp/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/16/839eff84e41c921a790f6a7067008caf.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/16/839eff84e41c921a790f6a7067008caf.jpg", "description": "Packers defensive tackle Mike Daniels is looking for any edge to beat an opposing lineman.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Mike McCarthy mixing it up in Packers camp"}, "Author": "GENARO C.
