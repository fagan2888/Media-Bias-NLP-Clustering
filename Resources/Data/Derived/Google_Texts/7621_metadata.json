Matt Bevin took,\u201d said Adkisson. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to be interesting to see how all that works out.\u201d\n\nLast week, Bevin became just the second Republican to win an election for Kentucky governor since the early 1970s in a campaign that focused largely on health care.\n\nOn Friday, the governor-elect said dismantling the state-run health care exchange, called Kynect, would be a top priority for his administration. He also said he\u2019ll seek to roll back the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion, another initiative undertaken by outgoing Gov. Steve Beshear through the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nBevin has said Kynect is redundant because the federal government also runs a health care exchange.\n\nRelated Story What May Happen If Obamacare Is Rolled Back in Kentucky\n\nAdkisson said the Medicaid expansion and examining whether the state can afford taking on its future costs will be a major challenge for Bevin.\n\nAnother hotly contested issue in the 2015 campaign was right-to-work legislation, which would prohibit union dues as a condition of employment.\n\nBevin, a Louisville businessman, supports right-to-work, and Adkisson said he agrees.\n\n\u201cSo with a new governor firmly espousing right-to-work, the business community firmly behind right-to-work \u2014 it will have momentum, I think it will get hearings in a couple of legislative sessions,\u201d Adkisson said.\n\nHe noted that the Democratic-controlled state House presents an obstacle.\n\n\u201cClearly the House of Representatives is not there yet \u2014 they will probably resist that,\u201d Adkisson said. \u201cBut I think right-to-work is going to come to Kentucky at some point, the question is how much political fervor will there be between now and then?\u201d\n\nThe Kentucky General Assembly convenes on Jan 5.
