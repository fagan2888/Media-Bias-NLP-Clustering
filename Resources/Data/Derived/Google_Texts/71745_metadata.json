Verrilli Jr. said.\n\nThe contraceptive mandate has been controversial from the start, with religious groups saying they wanted no part of what they see as sinful activity by having their insurance pay for their female employees\u2019 access to artificial contraceptives that violate church teachings.\n\nAttempting a compromise, the Obama administration said nonprofits wouldn\u2019t have to pay for coverage \u2014 but said they still had to fill out a form alerting their insurers, who would then step in to provide the coverage at no cost to the nonprofits.\n\nReligious groups said signing the form still makes them complicit.\n\nIn an unusual move, the Supreme Court last month ordered both sides to try to think of other solutions \u2014 and the justices even offered one of their own: religiously affiliated charities, hospitals and universities that object to contraception \u2014 such as the Little Sisters of the Poor order of nuns that brought the case \u2014 could tell their insurers that they don\u2019t want their plans to do things to which they object on religious grounds.\n\nArmed with that knowledge, insurance companies would then notify the employees directly that \u201cthe insurance company will provide cost-free contraceptive coverage, and that such coverage is not paid for by [the charities] and is not provided through petitioners\u2019 health plan.\u201d\n\nThe administration late Tuesday urged the court to stick with Mr. Obama\u2019s scheme instead, saying it wasn\u2019t that different from what the justices wanted.\n\n\u201cThe accommodation already relieves petitioners of any obligation to provide contraceptive coverage and instead requires insurers to provide coverage separately,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe only difference is the way the accommodation is invoked.\u201d\n\nIn its own brief the Little Sisters said \u201cyes\u201d to the court\u2019s proposal, so long as it cut the nonprofits completely out of the process. For instance, the government could require insurance companies that contract with employers that do not insure contraceptives to contact affected employees and offer them separate coverage.\n\nAttorneys at The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which is representing the Little Sisters, said the government could pay for the coverage as individual policies or as part of group plans if it wants.\n\n\u201cThe government can get contraceptive coverage to petitioners\u2019 employees \u2014 and can even do so through the same insurance companies with which some petitioners contract \u2014 without demanding, on pain of massive penalties, that petitioners take steps to comply with the contraceptive mandate,\u201d the group\u2019s attorneys wrote.\n\nBecket said the government would have to develop its own methods for reaching out to employees of nonprofits that self-insure. For instance, it could ask willing doctors to tell those women how to enroll in the separate plans or launch some other type of awareness campaign.\n\nThe justices are grasping for middle ground after they appeared split, 4-4, along familiar lines over lawsuits from religious groups who say the Obama administration \u201chijacked\u201d their employer health plans to carry out its contraceptive mandate.\n\nMr. Verrilli said the court must \u201cmake clear\u201d that the government can still require the nonprofits\u2019 insurers to provide separate contraceptive coverage to the objectors\u2019 employees.\n\nAny gray area, he wrote, \u201ccould lead to years of additional litigation, during which tens of thousands of women would likely continue to be denied the coverage to which they are legally entitled.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The administration shot down the Supreme Court's effort to forge a compromise on Obamacare's contraceptive mandate, saying Tuesday that the justices' alternative proposal would set up too many hurdles for the government and insurers.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The administration shot down the Supreme Court\u2019s effort to forge a compromise on Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive mandate, saying Tuesday that the justices\u2019 alternative proposal would set up too many hurdles for the government and insurers.", "title": "Obama rejects Supreme Court\u2019s contraception trade-off", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/12/obama-rejects-supreme-courts-contraception-trade-o/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/12/bcp.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/12/bcp.jpg", "description": "The administration shot down the Supreme Court's effort to forge a compromise on Obamacare's contraceptive mandate, saying Tuesday that the justices' alternative proposal would set up too many hurdles", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama rejects Supreme Court\u2019s contraception trade-off"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Labor, Social Issues, Donald B Verrilli Jr"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddb00\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe accommodation already relieves petitioners of any obligation to provide contraceptive coverage and instead requires insurers to provide coverage separately,\u201d he wrote.\nMr. Verrilli said the court must \u201cmake clear\u201d that the government can still require the nonprofits\u2019 insurers to provide separate contraceptive coverage to the objectors\u2019 employees.\nBecket said the government would have to develop its own methods for reaching out to employees of nonprofits that self-insure.\nInstead, the Justice Department asked the court to stick with President Obama\u2019s current plans, which require religious charities such as Catholic hospitals and religious schools to sign a form triggering the contraceptive coverage.\nThe administration shot down the Supreme Court\u2019s effort to forge a compromise on Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive mandate, saying Tuesday that the justices\u2019 alternative proposal would set up too many hurdles for the government and insurers."}
