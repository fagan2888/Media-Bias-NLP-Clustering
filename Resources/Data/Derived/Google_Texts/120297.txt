A local gun show in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania left one woman hospitalized after she was accidentally shot in the leg, local station WNEP is reporting.

On Saturday, Krysta Gearhart, was shot by Geoffrey Hawk, “In Case of Emergency” owner, while he was demonstrating the usage of a concealed and carry holster. According to WNEP, police said a plastic model of a gun is typically used during demonstrations.

“Often times that is what is utilized,” explained Sergeant Leonard Rogutski, of the Bloomsburg Police. “This time the vendor used a real gun.”

In this case Hawk demonstrated with a semi-automatic .380, and though no magazine was attached, there was one round in the chamber.
