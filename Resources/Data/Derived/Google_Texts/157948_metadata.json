No one was injured. Captain Wilfore says at no time did the vehicle cross into the other lane of traffic and at no time was anyone else in danger.\n\nWilfore says they had multiple slide-offs around the area Saturday morning due to slick roads. We got a photo from viewer Terry Jacobs which shows a newer, black SUV in the ditch along Jackrabbit Lane at approximately 12:35 p.m. Saturday.\n\n\n\nAround 2:00 p.m. Kim tweeted \"Thank you God for watching over us and keeping us safe.\"According to Radar Online, the Kardashian sisters were in Montana skiing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Reality TV stars Kim and Khloe Kardashian and their younger sister Kylie Jenner were reportedly involved in a slide-off accident in Bozeman Saturday morning.", "og": {"url": "http://www.kbzk.com/story/28167104/kardashian-sisters-in-bozeman-car-accident", "image": "http://KBZK.images.worldnow.com/images/6797678_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Reality TV stars Kim and Khloe Kardashian and their younger sister Kylie Jenner were reportedly involved in a slide-off accident in Bozeman Saturday morning.", "title": "Kardashian sisters in Bozeman car accident"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KBZK.images.worldnow.com/images/6797678_G.jpg", "description": "Reality TV stars Kim and Khloe Kardashian and their younger sister Kylie Jenner were reportedly involved in a slide-off accident in Bozeman Saturday morning.", "card": "summary", "title": "Kardashian sisters in Bozeman car accident"}, "wnreadableurl": "kardashian-sisters-in-bozeman-car-accident", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KBZK", "fb": {"app_id": 165722920162008}, "date": "2015/02/21", "KEYWORDS": "Reality TV stars Kim and Khloe Kardashian and their younger sister Kylie Jenner were reportedly involved in a slide-off accident in Bozeman Saturday morning.", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS07", "news_keywords": "Reality TV stars Kim and Khloe Kardashian and their younger sister Kylie Jenner were reportedly involved in a slide-off accident in Bozeman Saturday morning."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf26\"", "article_summary": "Reality TV stars Kim and Khloe Kardashian and their younger sister Kylie Jenner were involved in a slide-off accident in Bozeman Saturday morning.\n\"According to Radar Online, the Kardashian sisters were in Montana skiing.\nCaptain Wilfore says at no time did the vehicle cross into the other lane of traffic and at no time was anyone else in danger.\nWe got a photo from viewer Terry Jacobs which shows a newer, black SUV in the ditch along Jackrabbit Lane at approximately 12:35 p.m. Saturday.\nAccording to Montana Highway Patrol Captain Mark Wilfore, the slide off happened just before noon."}
