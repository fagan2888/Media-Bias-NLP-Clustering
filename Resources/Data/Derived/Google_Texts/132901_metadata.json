New Prospect Missionary Baptist Church held a breast cancer awareness program that featured the stories of survivors and the battles they had to overcome.\n\n\"I had to walk this journey, but I have a clear understanding that while cancer happened to me it happened for others,\" 13 year survivor Marsha Jones Rush said. \"I'm very humbled because there are many that started out that was diagnosed during the time that I was, and of course they're not here now.\"\n\nThe survivors who stood before the crowd gave a brief glimpse into their lives and how their story has impacted others. It's a journey, that while at times challenging, became a learning moment for those survivors to share with others.\n\n\"That you never give up,\" said Hattye Jones who was diagnosed with breast cancer in November 2012. That every sickness is not until death, that sometimes it really is a testimony that's not just for me, but for those people that know me and know that I've stood and I'm still standing and God is still in control.\"\n\nThe color pink and the many breast cancer awareness ribbons, have become all too noticeable during the months of October and for those who have survived or are battling cancer, it's a sign of hope.\n\n\"My heart is really overjoyed for every person that I see wearing the pins, wearing the pink, because I think about those that didn't win the fight, but the war is still going on, we are making strides, we are winning this thing,\" Rush said.\n\nAnd for those who have survived, not only do they become a voice for others, but they have valiantly fought a disease that takes many lives.\n\n\"I'm not a cancer survivor because to me survivor means I got through it, but what I'll tell is that I'm a cancer overcomer because I've defeated this,\" Rush said. I don't have to worry about that, that's done. I have won the battle with that.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The New Prospect Missionary Baptist Church featured a ceremony today full of breast cancer survivors and their stories.", "language": "english", "author": "Aaron Morrison", "og": {"description": "The New Prospect Missionary Baptist Church featured a ceremony today full of breast cancer survivors and their stories.", "title": "Breast Cancer Survivors Tell Stories of Overcoming Battles", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Breast-Cancer-Survivors-Tell-Stories-of-Overcoming-280470082.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/009/634/009634B70E54495B9C153B8E654423E1", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/A4A/6F5/A4A6F52A5731432798660341165EEECF.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "The New Prospect Missionary Baptist Church featured a ceremony today full of breast cancer survivors and their stories.", "title": "Breast Cancer Survivors Tell Stories of Overcoming Battles", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Breast-Cancer-Survivors-Tell-Stories-of-Overcoming-280470082.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Breast+Cancer+Awareness+(400x225).jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Breast Cancer Survivors Tell Stories of Overcoming Battles", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Breast Cancer Survivors Tell Stories"}, "article_summary": "New Prospect Missionary Baptist Church held a breast cancer awareness program that featured the stories of survivors and the battles they had to overcome.\n\"That you never give up,\" said Hattye Jones who was diagnosed with breast cancer in November 2012.\n\"I'm not a cancer survivor because to me survivor means I got through it, but what I'll tell is that I'm a cancer overcomer because I've defeated this,\" Rush said.\nThe color pink and the many breast cancer awareness ribbons, have become all too noticeable during the months of October and for those who have survived or are battling cancer, it's a sign of hope.\nThe survivors who stood before the crowd gave a brief glimpse into their lives and how their story has impacted others."}
