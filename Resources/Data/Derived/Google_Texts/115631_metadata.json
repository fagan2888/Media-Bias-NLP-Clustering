U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter and French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian hosted a meeting of five other coalition partners on Wednesday to discuss what each could do to intensify the fight against Islamic State in Iraq, Syria and beyond. The two men said the coalition is setting its sights in the coming weeks on pushing Islamic State out of the major cities from which the group controls its territory: Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq.\n\nREUTERS\n\nSince Sunday, the coalition has conducted three airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Mosul, Mr. Le Drian said at a news conference with Mr. Carter at France\u2019s Defense Ministry. Amid political pressure in Washington and abroad, the U.S. has sought to expand its own fight against Islamic State and is eager for allies to show they will do so as well. On Tuesday, the White House gave the Defense Department legal authority to target militants affiliated with Islamic State in Afghanistan. Gordon Lubold and Matthew Dalton report.\n\nPlus: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met Wednesday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to try to push ahead international talks on a political transition in Syria, a process complicated by divisions over who will represent the Syrian opposition \u2026 Islamic State militants are using Syria\u2019s largest dam as a fulcrum of power, hiding high-value prisoners and sheltering senior officials there in the conviction the U.S. won\u2019t bomb it for fear of unleashing a giant flood \u2026 Tensions are rising between governments and big U.S. technology companies over widening surveillance demands, part of a broader debate over how to reconcile online privacy with the fight against terrorism.\n\nPATRICK O\u2019CONNOR\u2019S EARLY HIT: WHY HILLARY CLINTON IS EMBRACING BARACK OBAMA\u2019S LEGACY\n\nHillary Clinton and her would-be Republican rivals don\u2019t agree on much these days, but one consensus is starting to emerge \u2013 that the former secretary of state is, indeed, running to preserve President Barack Obama\u2018s legacy. Before Republican strategists do a victory lap, it\u2019s worth noting how Mr. Obama is viewed by voters at the beginning of his eighth and final year in the White House.

Recent polls show that Mr. Trump is far ahead of his GOP rivals in Florida. Older Cuban-Americans who came to the U.S. soon after the Cuban Revolution appear especially open to his message, according to some Miami Republicans. Interviews with Florida Hispanic Republicans suggest that while Mr. Trump benefits from pockets of support, many regard him with unease, or even hostility. Arian Campo-Flores reports.\n\nMore on 2016: Mr. Trump lit into rival Sen. Ted Cruz Wednesday morning for taking bank loans to finance his Senate campaign that he didn\u2019t properly disclose during his successful 2012 run \u2026 Mr. Cruz said his campaign raised $700,000 in the hours after he was pointedly criticized by Iowa Gov.

Bernie Sanders for his comments dismissing Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign, two big liberal groups backing Mrs. Clinton, as part of the \u201cestablishment.\u201d\n\nIRAN NUCLEAR DEAL DEBATE FLARES UP IN TIGHT SENATE RACES: Republican Jon Keyser had officially been a Senate candidate in Colorado for only one day last week when he began criticizing Democratic incumbent Sen. Michael Bennet over the Iran nuclear deal. Mr. Keyser was quick to try to link Mr. Bennet\u2019s support for the accord struck last July aimed at severely constraining Iran\u2019s nuclear program with the country\u2019s detention of 10 U.S. sailors in the Persian Gulf. The sailors were released less than 24 hours later, but the incident\u2014as well as two missile tests Iran conducted last fall\u2014provided fodder for Republicans who argued Democrats have misplaced trust in Iran and will have to shoulder political liability from the deal. The Iran debate has also recently surfaced in tight races in Ohio, Wisconsin and Nevada. Kristina Peterson reports.\n\nPlus: Senate Democrats blocked legislation to pause and overhaul a program to resettle Syrian and Iraqi refugees in the U.S., stalling the momentum of a measure that President Barack Obama says is untenable and contrary to American values.\n\nALSO IN THE NEWS\n\nFinancial markets are in a panic over a sharp economic downturn that has yet to make an appearance\u2014and may never, writes Greg Ip.

Plus, Ebola, Zika virus and other infectious diseases have catapulted the threat of infectious-disease epidemics to a top spot at the World Economic Forum as world leaders meet in Davos this week.\n\nTreasury Secretary Jacob Lew issued his most forceful call to date for Congress to pass legislation allowing Puerto Rico to restructure its debts and avoid looming defaults during his first visit to the island territory Wednesday.\n\nHouse Republican lawmakers issued subpoenas Wednesday to Obama administration officials, seeking documents about payments the federal government made to insurance companies under the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nFederal climate experts announced Wednesday that 2015 was the warmest year world-wide since reliable global record-keeping began in 1880, easily surpassing a record set in 2014.\n\nWidespread teacher \u201csickouts\u201d all but closed Detroit\u2019s public schools Wednesday and Republican legislators in Illinois called for a state takeover of Chicago\u2019s district, as two of the nation\u2019s largest systems face financial strain.\n\nAmid the gloom hanging over China, a senior adviser to Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a rare defense of the country\u2019s economy, saying Beijing has strong leadership to continue its effort to remake the country\u2019s growth model while pledging not to launch massive stimulus to revive growth.\n\nSeven people were killed by a Taliban car bomb in Kabul targeting staff of one of Afghanistan\u2019s largest television networks on Wednesday, the latest in a wave of attacks that are shaking the country.\u2019\n\nA new report by retired judge Robert Owen said former Kremlin spy Alexander Litvinenko was probably murdered on the orders of Russia\u2019s FSB intelligence service.\n\nSEIB VIDEO: DO POLITICAL ENDORSEMENTS REALLY MATTER?\n\nWith Donald Trump receiving a political endorsement from Sarah Palin, Washington Bureau Chief Jerry Seib discusses whether such announcements have lasting impact.\n\nWHAT WE\u2019RE READING AROUND THE WEB\n\nSen. Ted Cruz is \u201ctrying to dispense with Marco Rubio by choking off his path to the nomination in New Hampshire,\u201d and is trying to use Mr. Rubio\u2019s support of immigration reform to do it, writes Sahil Kapur of Bloomberg.\n\nDov S. Zakheim writes in National Interest that some of the funds Iran will receive now that international economic sanctions are being lifted will go to its economy, but that \u201cthey also are needed to accelerate Iran\u2019s ongoing thrust for regional hegemony.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s aim of trying to get voters to view a Bernie Sanders nomination as too risky in a general election is complicated by the lack of enthusiasm for her candidacy, especially among younger voters, and the great enthusiasm among voters for his, writes BloombergView\u2019s Al Hunt. To help her close the enthusiasm gap, he writes, one name occurs: Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nHarold Meyerson writes for the American Prospect that to do better in elections the Democratic Party needs an organized left\u2014\u201dif only because the prospects for building an organized center are nil, and because a progressive economic program that limits corporate and financial power with the countervailing power of workers, consumers, and citizens would unite the Democratic base, strengthen the party\u2019s ability to recapture working-class voters now lost to it, and help rebuild the country\u2019s shrunken middle class.\u201d\n\nIn the WSJ\u2019s Think Tank, John Feehery writes that political instability produces economic instability and wonders: \u201cWill something change before voting begins, or are those looking to elect populists prepared to make the problems facing the country much, much worse?\u201d\n\nMILESTONE\n\n54.4\u00b0 F: For the 48 contiguous U.S. states, 2015 was the second-warmest year on record, with an average temperature of
