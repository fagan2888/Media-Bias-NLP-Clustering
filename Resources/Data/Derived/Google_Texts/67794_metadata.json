David McKinley, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Sustainability News, Politics News\n\nRep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., is on a roll. After successfully passing a budget amendment back in May that basically forbids the Pentagon from acknowledging climate science \u2014 despite the fact that the Department of Defense considers doing so to be vital to national security \u2014 his newest effort prohibits both the U.S. Department of Energy and the Army Corps of Engineers from spending \u201cto design, implement, administer or carry out specified assessments regarding climate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpending precious resources to pursue a dubious climate change agenda compromises our clean-energy research and America\u2019s infrastructure,\u201d McKinley said on the House floor, according to the WV Gazette. \u201cCongress should not be spending money pursuing ideologically driven experiments.\u201d\n\nNeither amendment is likely to get past the Democrat-controlled Senate, of course, but they remain nonetheless a fascinating exercise in anti-science sentiment among House Republicans (only five Democrats supported the most recent amendment). McKinley\u2019s amendment is part of the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, which passed Thursday night and contains a whole bunch of silly, anti-environmental measures, which include slashing the Energy Department\u2019s budget for renewable energy programs by $100 million.\n\nThe WV Gazette has more on the particular absurdity of McKinley\u2019s amendment, which basically requires the government to ignore the overwhelming consensus of climate scientists:\n\nParts of the missions of the Department of Energy and the Corps of Engineers would seem to be inextricable from climate change and climate science. For instance, the bill authorizes $1.7 billion for the Corps of Engineers to spend on river and harbor construction, flood- and storm-damage reduction and shore protection. Meanwhile, the National Climate Assessment reports that the global sea level has risen by eight inches since 1880 and is projected to rise another one to four feet by 2100. The global sea level rose about twice as fast in the years since 1992 as it did in the previous century, the report said. The Department of Energy also is heavily involved with efforts to address climate change. \u201cWe develop new technologies and reduce the costs of renewables, new nuclear, environmental protection in natural gas production, carbon capture and sequestration, really across the board,\u201d Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz said in a May teleconference, describing his agency\u2019s actions on climate change. \u201cAddressing the effects of climate change is a top priority of the Energy Department,\u201d the agency\u2019s website says. \u201cAs global temperature rise, wildfires, drought and high electricity demand put stress on the nation\u2019s energy infrastructure. And severe weather \u2014 the leading cause of power outages and fuel supply disruption in the United States \u2014 is projected to worsen.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Another ridiculous, anti-science amendment aims to prevent the government from doing its job", "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Another ridiculous, anti-science amendment aims to prevent the government from doing its job", "title": "House bans the Department of Energy from acknowledging climate change", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/14/house_bans_the_department_of_energy_from_acknowledging_climate_change/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_130778297.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Another ridiculous, anti-science amendment aims to prevent the government from doing its job", "creator": "@readingirl", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_130778297.jpg", "title": "House bans the Department of Energy from acknowledging climate change", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "House bans the Department of Energy from acknowledging climate change", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, climate change denialism, Department of Energy, House Republicans, Rep.
