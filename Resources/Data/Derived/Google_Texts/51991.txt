We love to categorize different aspects of ourselves, but perhaps not as much as we love to categorize other people. We talk about our astrological signs and feel a sense of camaraderie with those who share our skin or hair color. In fact, DNews recently filmed an entire video on one of the most popular ways we categorize others: personality.

While the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator suggests there are 16 personalities, the ones we commonly hear are type A and type B. These two personality types were first defined in the 1950s by a couple of cardiologists who were looking at differences in personality as possible causes for heart disease. They found that type A people were much more likely to have heart disease, a claim that has since been questioned. But what does that even mean?

Traditionally, type A people are described as bossy, competitive, and impatient, but also very diligent workers. Type B people are the opposite â€” relaxed, easygoing, and they often "go with the flow." And yet, people don't always fit neatly into these two types.

Watch the video above to learn more, plus the advantages associated with each personality type.
