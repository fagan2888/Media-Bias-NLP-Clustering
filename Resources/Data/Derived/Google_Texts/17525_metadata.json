Ted Cruz\u2019s wife confirmed in an interview with The New York Times that her husband gets his health care coverage from Goldman Sachs, where she has worked for eight years as a managing director in the Houston division.\n\n\u201cTed is on my health care plan,\u201d Heidi Cruz told the newspaper in a story published Wednesday.\n\nA spokeswoman for the senator confirmed Cruz\u2019s $20,000 coverage plan with the paper. \u201cThe senator is on his wife\u2019s plan, which comes at no cost to the taxpayer and reflects a personal decision about what works best for their family,\u201d Catherine Frazier said.\n\nAccording to a 2013 Kaiser study, the average for a employer-provided family coverage plan is $16,351. A 2009 New York Times report shows that Goldman Sachs\u2019 plans for executives and managing directors are worth double the average plan\u2013more than $40,000 annually in premiums for each family.\n\nThe senator who has become the most vocal crusader against Obamacare has dodged questions about his own health coverage even after driving the two-week government shutdown earlier this month.\n\nNear the end of Cruz\u2019s 21-hour faux filibuster leading into the shutdown, Sen. Dick Durbin asked the Texas senator where he gets his coverage from. \u201cWill the senator from Texas for the record tell us now\u2013and those who watched this debate\u2013whether he is protected and his family\u2019s protected?\u201d Durbin asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to tell you now I am eligible for it and I am not currently covered under it,\u201d Cruz replied, shifting to an earlier example of an uninsured diabetic woman.\n\nHeidi Cruz also said that she was out of town for work on the night her husband occupied the Senate floor. The senator\u2019s chief of staff called her that evening and asked her if she had any suggestions for a bedtime story he could recite to their two daughters from the Senate floor. She responded, \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham,\u201d and so her husband read the Dr. Seuss book.\n\n\u201cWhen Americans tried it, they discovered they did not like green eggs and ham and they did not like Obamacare either,\u201d Cruz told his fellow senators while reading from the famous tale. \u201cThey did not like Obamacare in a box, with a fox, in a house or with a mouse. It is not working.\u201d (Actually, the book\u2019s narrator finally tries green eggs and ham and likes it.)\n\n\u201cTed is very much a visionary,\u201d said Heidi Cruz, whose friends describe her as \u201cless ideological\u201d than her husband. \u201cHe is very strategic, and he\u2019s very practical, and he does what needs to be done, not what everybody wants him to do.\u201d\n\nSenator Cruz\u2019s high profile has raised speculation that he\u2019s planning a 2016 White House run. When asked if she could envision herself as first lady, the senator\u2019s wife laughed.\n\n\u201cUm, I don\u2019t think I should answer that,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Senator Cruz's wife Heidi Cruz confirmed that her husband has health insurance through her job at banking giant Goldman Sachs.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/ted-cruz-goldmans-health-care-plan", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Senator Cruz's wife Heidi Cruz confirmed that her husband has health insurance through her job at banking giant Goldman Sachs.", "title": "Ted Cruz gets his health care plan from Goldman Sachs", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/ted-cruz-goldmans-health-care-plan", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/articles/ap120609147653.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/ted-cruz-goldmans-health-care-plan", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/ap120609147653.jpg?itok=d7_R3t0D", "height": 553}, "title": "Ted Cruz gets his health care plan from Goldman Sachs", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Senator Cruz's wife Heidi Cruz confirmed that her husband has health insurance through her job at banking giant Goldman Sachs."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-23T20:45:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "clarehkim", "title": "Ted Cruz gets his health care plan from Goldman Sachs", "tags": "affordable-care-act,filibuster,health,health-care-reform,media,obamacare,republicans,society,tea-party,ted-cruz,texas,the-last-word", "published": 1, "date": "10/23/2013 20:45:00 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/ted-cruz-goldmans-health-care-plan"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/msnbc"}, "abstract": "Senator Cruz's wife Heidi Cruz confirmed that her husband has health insurance through her job at banking giant Goldman Sachs.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Health, Health Care Reform, Republicans, Tea Party, Society, Media, Affordable Care Act, Filibuster, Obamacare, Ted Cruz, Texas"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca504\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTed is on my health care plan,\u201d Heidi Cruz told the newspaper in a story published Wednesday.\nAccording to a 2013 Kaiser study, the average for a employer-provided family coverage plan is $16,351.\nA spokeswoman for the senator confirmed Cruz\u2019s $20,000 coverage plan with the paper.\nSen.
