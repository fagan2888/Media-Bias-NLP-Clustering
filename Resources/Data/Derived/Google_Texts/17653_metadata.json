It has required a comprehensive rethinking of the way care is provided. This rethinking also must include the role of health care professionals in new, team-based models of care,\" said HAP President and CEO Andy Carter.\n\nAllowing full-practice authority for CNPs after meeting the three-years/3,600-hour physician collaboration requirements would make Pennsylvania one of the strictest states in the U.S. allowing practice without the collaborative/written agreement.\n\nCurrently, 21 states and the District of Columbia allow CNPs to practice to their full authority.\n\nHAP believes that CNPs do not need unending physician supervision when caring for patients within the boundaries of their training.\n\n\"Today's health care professionals are being educated to function as part of a practicing health care team, which is consistent with the team-based care delivery models being used by hospitals and health systems. The full use of CNPs and other clinical professionals is needed to build strong patient relationships, help patients and families follow care plans, coordinate care across the continuum, improve patients' health literacy, and provide health education. Allowing full-practice authority for CNPs after meeting the appropriate physician collaboration requirements is a reasonable, responsible approach to helping to meet the growing health care needs for Pennsylvania,\" said Carter.\n\nAn amendment to Senate Bill 717 is pending in the State Senate that would allow full practice authority for CNPs after meeting the three-year/3,600-hour physician collaboration requirements.\n\nABOUT HAP: HAP is a statewide membership services organization that advocates for nearly 240 Pennsylvania acute and specialty care, primary care, subacute care, long-term care, home health, and hospice providers, as well as the patients and communities they serve.
