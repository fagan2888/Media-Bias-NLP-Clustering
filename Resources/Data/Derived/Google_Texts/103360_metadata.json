The firm is one of more than 30 contractors that helped build the government\u2019s $800 million online insurance exchange, which failed when it first launched in October 2013.\n\nRep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.) issued a letter to IRS Commissioner John Koskinen on Friday demanding information about the agreement, including all internal communications regarding the decision. Roskam, who heads the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight, sent the request days after the Daily Caller reported the CGI contract in an article last week.\n\n\n\nThe IRS is still working with one of the key players in developing the once-glitchy HealthCare.gov Web site. (AP/Susan Walsh)\n\n\u201cGiven your publicly-stated concerns about resource challenges at the IRS, I am seeking assurance that taxpayer dollars are being put to their highest and best use,\u201d the lawmaker said.\n\nThe letter came one day after the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general issued a report saying HHS did not properly vet the contractors that built HealthCare.gov.\n\nThe IRS said in a statement last week that it has worked with CGI Federal \u201cgoing back several years\u201d and that the contract was part of a multi-year award that started in 2011 and continued with a five-year agreement completed in August 2013, months before the failed launch of HealthCare.gov.\n\nThe agency also said that its work on the Affordable Care Act \u201ccontinues to go well\u201d and that it \u201cclosely monitors all of our work involving the health-care initiative, including contractors.\u201d\n\nUnder the contract, CGI Federal will not run or operate any part of IRS.gov, including the pages related to the Affordable Care Act, the agency said.\n\nThe government fired CGI Federal from the HealthCare.gov project in January 2014, opting to go with another firm to finish the company\u2019s work. Agency officials decided that CGI had not been effective enough in fixing the computer system that serves as the underpinning of the online exchange, according to a Washington Post report at the time.\n\nA firm hired to review CGI Federal\u2019s performance with the exchange found 21,000 lines of defective software code in the system, according to a report last year from Republicans on the Senate Finance and Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a Department of Health and Human Services agency responsible for HealthCare.gov, has fixed the bugs in Web site, and more than 7 million Americans have enrolled in insurance plans through the portal. But the early problems added significant costs to the project.\n\nCGI Federal also created online insurance exchanges for Massachusetts and Vermont, both of which terminated their contracts with the company last year after their sites failed to work.\n\nCGI Federal spokeswoman Linda Odorisio said in a statement on Monday that the company has \u201cestablished a strong record of service to the Department of Treasury and continues to take great pride in its work for the IRS.\u201d\n\nRoskam spokeswoman Stephanie Kittredge said Monday that the chairman \u201cfound the public response from the IRS unsatisfactory and intends to carefully review the actual contract, process, and communications that allowed the IRS to award a multi-million dollar contract to a company with a clear history of failing to produce results for taxpayers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The contractor, a key player in developing the once-glitchy HealthCare.gov site, is helping the IRS handle its responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act for $4.5 million.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jadam.hicks", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The contractor, a key player in developing the once-glitchy HealthCare.gov site, is helping the IRS handle its responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act for $4.5 million.", "title": "IRS now paying company that muffed HealthCare.gov work", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/01/27/irs-now-paying-company-that-muffed-healthcare-gov-work/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/files/http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_908w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/04/10/Production/WashingtonPost/Images/TaxRefundFraud-0e4fd-4202.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@reporter_hicks"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/federal-eye/wp/2015/01/27/irs-now-paying-company-that-muffed-healthcare-gov-work/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "irs; internal revenue service; irs commissioner; irs chief; john koskinen; government accountability; federal contracting; federal contractor; healthcare.gov; obamacare; affordable care act; aca; cgi; cgi federal; cgi obamacare; cgi healthcare.gov; federal news; federal government; federal news; hhs; cms; health and human services; centers for medicare and medicaid research; washington post; josh hicks; federal eye", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jadam.hicks"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "irs; internal revenue service; irs commissioner; irs chief; john koskinen; government accountability; federal contracting; federal contractor; healthcare.gov; obamacare; affordable care act; aca; cgi; cgi federal; cgi obamacare; cgi healthcare.gov; federal news; federal government; federal news; hhs; cms; health and human services; centers for medicare and medicaid research; washington post; josh hicks; federal eye"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0653\"", "article_summary": "The IRS is still working with one of the key players in developing the once-glitchy HealthCare.gov Web site.\nThe IRS hired CGI Federal to help \u201cintegrate various work projects\u201d related to the health-care law, according to a statement from the agency last week.\nThe government fired CGI Federal from the HealthCare.gov project in January 2014, opting to go with another firm to finish the company\u2019s work.\nCGI Federal also created online insurance exchanges for Massachusetts and Vermont, both of which terminated their contracts with the company last year after their sites failed to work.\nRoskam, who heads the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight, sent the request days after the Daily Caller reported the CGI contract in an article last week."}
