One in five Americans now read on e-readers or tablet computers, and most things that can be found in a book are little more than a click or touch away online. That trend has been the catalyst behind chain and independent bookstores closing at record pace. To avoid a similar fate, libraries across the country are trying to reinvent themselves and prove the digital revolution doesn\u2019t mean the end of a book-lovers\u2019 era.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing about how the Internet is killing libraries. It\u2019s not true, it\u2019s created other demands,\u201d John Bertot, a library science professor at the University of Maryland in College Park and co-director for the Information Policy and Access Center, told ThinkProgress.\n\nThe reality is libraries are having a bit of an identity crisis. They\u2019re no longer \u201cjust repositories of books and other media, but places where people can experiment and create,\u201d Barbara Stripling, president of the American Library Association based in Chicago, told ThinkProgress.\n\nTechnology has, in many ways, helped keep libraries afloat. A Pew Research study released earlier this year found that people who use libraries are technophiles, relishing in mobile gadgets, e-readers and heavily Internet users. Ninety percent of highly engaged library goers, called information omnivores, are online daily, with 95 percent owning a cell phone or smartphone and nearly all of them using either e-readers or tablet computers, according to the study.\n\nA fast-evolving digital world has created a dichotomy where there\u2019s an increased opportunity to access troves of information but access isn\u2019t guaranteed. That\u2019s where libraries come in.\n\nAbout 20 percent of the country doesn\u2019t have Internet access at home, work or school, or on mobile devices, according to 2010 Census data. The approximately 60 million of Americans who don\u2019t have this access are overwhelmingly minorities and elderly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have access to the technology and don\u2019t have opportunity to practice, with regular instruction, you don\u2019t know how to do important everyday things like analyze and research and find the best car,\u201d Stripling said. Instead they grab the top three sites listed on Google or rely on recommendations from friends.\n\n\u201cIf you happen to be fortunate enough to have access [to computers and other technologies], and know how use it, you have so much at your finger tips,\u201d Bertot said. On the flip side, the skills you need to access that content are different with digital media versus print: \u201cYou\u2019ve gone from basic literacy requirements to needing a whole host of other skills, devices to extract content and do research.\u201d\n\nEven though more people are online than ever before thanks to smartphones, that\u2019s not the same thing as having access. There\u2019s a wealth gap that impacts whether certain populations can even access not just new technologies, but adequately plugged-in libraries. Minorities disproportionately use mobile devices as a primary means to access the Internet. Only 62 percent of African Americans have a broadband Internet connection at home, according to a separate Pew survey.\n\nBut while barely over half of African-Americans and Hispanics own smartphones, they\u2019re at least 13 percentage points more likely to use it to access the Internet over their white counterparts, Pew found in an Internet use survey in 2010. But you can\u2019t do research on a smartphone or easily navigate a government website, Bertot said. And if you\u2019re on an Apple device, websites that use Adobe Flash for graphics and video don\u2019t work well.\n\n\u201cWe know the country will be majority minority in 2020 and all of our communities are changing. We have to be sure that our librarians are diverse, so that those that those who work in the library reflect the community, Stripling said. Some libraries are in large immigrant communities, and many members might have come from countries that don\u2019t have libraries. So \u201cinstead of expecting them to leave their comfort zone and come to the library but libraries have to go out in the community and open a dialogue,\u201d she said.\n\nTo cope, libraries are looking to increase their presence through digital services such as an online \u201cAsk A Librarian\u201d function, mobile apps, or kiosks throughout the community that lend out books and movies. Libraries have also started beefing up their tech equipment. Many have installed 3-D printers, micropublishing equipment for book-binding, video equipment as part of makers\u2019 centers where people can use equipment to jump start their own business or just create something fun. In Washington, D.C.\u2019s landmark Martin Luther King, Jr. Library, visitors can use the digital commons to access pricey design software suites that could help a recent graduate or unemployed graphics artist tweak their portfolio.\n\nThe plethora of new technologies at local libraries also means librarians have to constantly go through training beyond what\u2019s taught in library science college programs to keep up. \u201cThere\u2019s a need for constant re-training because the information world continues to evolve and the technology itself continues to change,\u201d Stripling said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to help members of the public use e-readers, we have to first [be able to buy] it and then learn to use them.\u201d\n\nTechnology has shifted public libraries\u2019 entire model from the \u201cjust-in-case\u201d model, which was predicated on accumulating all this stuff \u2014 books, magazines, newspapers, scholarly publications \u2014 into a warehouse of information just in case you might need it. And librarians tried to link you to that information, Bertot explained. Now, \u201cit\u2019s a \u2018just-in-time\u2019 model; we don\u2019t have to have a building full of items. Increasingly, [people] don\u2019t have to come to the building,\u201d and can access \u2018the warehouse\u2019 via the library website.\n\nBut if people don\u2019t need to come into the library, why do they still need to exist? \u201cThe building is still really important in communities,\u201d Bertot said. And he\u2019s right.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t go to the library and have never been to one in their life believe they\u2019re vital to their communities, Pew found in it\u2019s library use report. Ninety percent of Americans older than age 16 say closing a library would have an impact on their community. Almost 70 percent of people who have never personally been to a library but know someone who has believe they\u2019re essential in promoting literacy, reading and giving everyone a chance to succeed. Another 64 percent say libraries improve communities\u2019 quality of life.\n\nThe key is transitioning libraries from a refuge of books stacked to the ceiling to an everything for everyone platform that\u2019s there when government programs and other efforts fail. \u201cPublic libraries have a reputation of being nice to have but not essential to have. The reality is that we have to shift the argument.\u201d\n\nPart of the challenge is that \u201cwe\u2019re terrible at selecting data and demonstrating our value,\u201d Bertot said. \u201cWe\u2019re not like the police department,\u201d which can cite statistics that correlate a rise in murders and crime to the number of police on the street, he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t say \u2018for every librarian you cut, three kids don\u2019t learn to read, we don\u2019t have data like that.\u201d\n\nLibraries took a hit like everyone else during the recession, affected by dried up fund reservoirs from local and state governments grappling with shrinking budgets. \u201cBut even as the economy tanked, library use was up,\u201d Bertot said. They functioned as bridges, connecting the public to the workforce, health care and, as an extension of the education system.\n\nThe unemployed turned to librarians for job counseling, with some using the space as an office. Others took their children to available programs like one teaching kids robotics. Libraries also held workshops to help people understand and sign up for the health exchanges brought on by the Affordable Care Act, Bertot said. In Baltimore, non-profit program Baltimarket partners with local libraries to help people without access to fresh, healthy foods order groceries online and offers cooking and nutrition classes so they can learn how to prepare meals.\n\nLibraries have a history of being invisible gap-fillers, stepping up when schools or other programs can\u2019t because of too few resources, even in natural disasters or other crises. In 2005 during Hurricane Katrina, Louisiana\u2019s libraries served as a refuge for citizens displaced by the storm, and let people use computers to contact relatives. They also put U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) forms on its website and coached residents through the application process. The same thing happened when Hurricane Sandy hit the East Coast in 2012, destroying the New Jersey coastline.\n\nIt\u2019s hard showing people how integral libraries are to the community and society as a whole. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to be all things to all people because we don\u2019t judge. We don\u2019t want to serve one part of the population and not the other. But that\u2019s hard to do when you go in front of budget committees,\u201d Bertot said.
