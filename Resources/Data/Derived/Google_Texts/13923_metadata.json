Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Maria Cantwell of Washington, Gary Peters of Michigan and Ron Wyden of Oregon, announced they will back the deal. Obama had already locked up votes to sustain his threatened veto of the disapproval resolution in the House and Senate.\n\nThe new Democratic support could now deny deal opponents the 60-vote filibuster threshold needed to advance the measure, preventing the president from having to use his veto pen.\n\nBut some Democrats in the Senate have spoken publicly about the importance of holding a final vote, leading some to predict they may refuse to support a Democratic filibuster, even though they plan to support the president and the deal.\n\nIf the resolution crossed the filibuster hurdle, final passage would then only require a simple majority. The White House was pushing them to hold firm.\n\n\u201cWe certainly would expect that those members of Congress who support the agreement to take the necessary steps in Congress to prevent Congress from undermining the agreement,\u201d said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, noting that 60 votes are \u201crequired to do just about anything in the United States Senate.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), however, warned senators against a filibuster, knowing that pushing Obama into a veto fight would be an embarrassing setback for the president and an outcome the White House hopes to avoid.\n\n\u201cThis debate should not be about a president who will leave office in 16 months. It should be about where our country will be,\u201d McConnell said as he opened the chamber after a four-week summer recess. Senators are \u201centitled to an up or down vote \u2014 not a filibuster or artificial limits on passage, but an important vote \u2014 on this resolution.\u201d\n\nThe partisan split will be on full display this week as proponents and opponents take their voices to the Capitol steps. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and fellow Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump will rally against the Iran deal on Wednesday. On Tuesday night, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi plans to welcome military families in a show of support.\n\nSupporters say the accord is the best hope for stopping the Iranian regime's pursuit of a nuclear bomb, but opponents, led by the pro-Israel American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, argue a better deal could have been reached.\n\nMany Democratic lawmakers have struggled with their decisions, but both the House and Senate are expected to give the president the two-thirds majority needed to uphold his veto. Pelosi also scooped up more backers Tuesday.\n\n\"I do not believe that supporting this deal will prevent Iran from eventually acquiring a nuclear weapon,\" Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said Tuesday, becoming the fourth Democratic senator to announce his opposition to the deal.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has offered to forgo the filibuster and move directly to a final vote as long as Republicans agree to require at least 60 votes for passage rather than 51. But lacking those votes, McConnell declined that offer Tuesday.\n\nThe House is set to vote Friday, and the Senate will likely finish next week before a self-imposed Sept. 17 deadline.\n\nThe Iran votes top a charged fall agenda that includes a budget showdown and a historic visit from Pope Francis that is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of faithful to the Capitol.\n\nAfter the Iran deal votes, Congress then has just two weeks to agree on legislation to fund the government and prevent a federal shutdown Oct. 1.\n\nCruz and other lawmakers are vowing a fight to defund Planned Parenthood after disclosures that the organization donates fetal tissue from abortions for research.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is already banned from using federal funds for abortions, except in limited cases of rape, incest or a threat to the life of the woman. But lawmakers want to cut off the money it receives for routine family planning services, including birth control and disease screenings.\n\nThe funding fight may resemble the 2013 battle led by Cruz over the Affordable Care Act, which resulted in a 16-day federal government shutdown that bruised both parties, but particularly the GOP.\n\nIn between the two top debates, lawmakers will welcome Pope Francis for the first-ever address by the leader of the Roman Catholic Church to a joint meeting of Congress.\n\nThe historic Sept. 24 address has prompted massive public interest. The pope, who is known for taking liberal views, could instill a measure of comity to the fall agenda -- or divide lawmakers further.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "As Congress returns, Obama wins key Senate support for Iran deal", "Description": "President Obama on Tuesday secured what he hopes will be the final Senate votes needed to block passage of a Republican-led resolution of disapproval against the landmark Iran nuclear deal, as Congress returned from recess to face a complicated fall schedule that also includes efforts to prevent...", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "President Obama on Tuesday secured what he hopes will be the final Senate votes needed to block passage of a Republican-led resolution of disapproval against the landmark Iran nuclear deal, as Congress returned from recess to face a complicated fall schedule that also includes efforts to prevent another government shutdown.", "title": "As Congress returns, Obama wins key Senate support for Iran deal", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-iran-obama-support-20150908-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55ef05bf/turbine/la-na-iran-obama-support-20150908", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp14.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/84378897", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-09-08", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9fc6\"", "article_summary": "Texas Sen.
