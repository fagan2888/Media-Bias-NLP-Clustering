Ted Cruz (R-TX) promised that if he was elected, his administration would oversee economic growth in excess of 5 percent a year stemming from reduced regulations, tax cuts for high-income earners and corporations, a balanced federal budget, and a return to the gold standard. Journalists and experts were quick to criticize Cruz\u2019s economic growth target, which exceeds by 1 percentage point a proposal by former Republican candidate Jeb Bush that was roundly mocked as \u201cnonsense\u201d and \u201cimpossible\u201d last summer.\n\nCruz Proclaims 5 Percent Economic Growth Will Be His \u201cNumber One Priority As President\u201d\n\nTed Cruz Promises \u201c3, 4, 5 Percent\u201d Growth Through Tax Cuts, Deregulation, And The Gold Standard. On the April 15 edition of CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, Republican presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz opened an hour-long guest spot by proclaiming that his \u201cnumber one priority as president\u201d would be spurring economic growth through tax cuts, deregulation, and what he called \u201ca rules-based monetary policy, ideally with some tie to gold.\u201d Cruz misleadingly claimed that historical standards for annual economic growth in the United States were \u201c3, 4, 5 percent\u201d -- annual growth rates in the U.S. average just 3 percent from 1969-2007, and have been closer to 2 percent in the wake of the Great Recession -- and maligned the economic and tax policy decisions of the Obama administration with weighing down the American economy since 2008. [CNBC, Squawk Box, 4/15/16]\n\nCruz: \u201cMy Object Is A Minimum Of 5 Percent GDP Growth.\u201d Later that hour, during a segment featuring discredited conservative economist Art Laffer -- whom Cruz credited with helping to \u201cthink through and design\u201d his tax plan -- the candidate pegged \u201ca minimum of 5 percent GDP growth\u201d as a target for his presumptive presidential administration. Even though Cruz acknowledged Laffer as an author of his tax policy, CNBC nonetheless allowed the \u201ctrickle-down\u201d economics enthusiast to pass off his biased commentary as straightforward expertise.

Bush reveals that the policies \u201cdid not spur economic growth\u201d:\n\nBut the economy hasn\u2019t grown by a five percent annual rate since that high point in 1984, according to government data, and hasn\u2019t even reached 4 percent growth in more than 15 years. The economy grew, on average, 3 percent a year between 1969 and 2007, and it\u2019s averaged about 2 percent growth for the last several years. [...] It\u2019s unlikely tax cuts will unleash huge economic growth, however. Cruz\u2019s plan would be a huge giveaway to corporations and the wealthy, with the richest 1 percent capturing half of all the benefits and just 7 percent going to the middle and lower class. It would also be costly, reducing government tax revenue by $8.6 trillion over a decade. And research has found that massive tax breaks for the wealthy don\u2019t trickle down into economic growth. In the post-war period, growth has generally been higher when the top marginal tax rate was also higher and lower then (sic) rates were substantially lower. When the top rate was more than 90 percent in the 1950s, for example, growth averaged more than 4 percent. More recently, multiple studies have found that Reagan\u2019s 1986 tax cuts did not spur economic growth, nor did the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. [ThinkProgress, 4/15/16]\n\nSalon: When Assessing Cruz\u2019s Promise Of Tax-Cut-Driven Growth, \u201cAssume The Opposite Will Happen.\u201d An April 18 article from Salon political writer Simon Maloy bludgeoned Cruz\u2019s promise of sustained 5 percent economic growth for far exceeding \u201cthe much-mocked and self-evidently overoptimistic guarantee\u201d of 4 percent growth pushed by Jeb Bush. The article also highlighted the problematic relationship Cruz has with conservative economist Art Laffer, who consistently supports disastrous \u201ctrickle-down\u201d tax cut policies (emphasis added):\n\nBut Cruz has an influential ally in his corner: Art Laffer, the high priest of trickle-down economics, who helped craft Cruz\u2019s plan. \u201cCruz\u2019s tax plan is better than Reagan\u2019s,\u201d Laffer told CNN. \u201cI think you\u2019ll get growth rates higher than Reagan\u2019s.\u201d A good rule of thumb is that whenever you see Art Laffer extolling the amazing economic impact of a tax-cut package, assume the opposite will happen. Laffer\u2019s time as a Cruz tax advisor was preceded by a high-profile stint as tax advisor to Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, who came into power by promising to turn the state into a laboratory of trickle-down economic theory. With Laffer\u2019s help, Brownback passed a tax package that knocked out taxes on small businesses and deeply cut rates across the board. Appearing with Brownback to hype the tax scheme, Laffer confidently predicted it would succeed beyond everyone\u2019s wildest dreams. \u201cThis will lead to enormous prosperity,\u201d Laffer told a group of Kansans in 2012. \u201cYou are moving into the pro-growth world, and believe me it will work.\u201d It did not work. The cuts predictably sent the state into a budget crisis as it scrambled to cover a series of massive deficits. To pay for these tax cuts, which overwhelmingly benefited the wealthy, Kansas imposed deep cuts to social programs and passed new consumption taxes that disproportionately affect the poor. And what did Kansans get for all this pain? Not much.

According to a March 29 tax policy analysis by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), Cruz\u2019s promise to dramatically cut taxes while balancing the budget would require cutting federal spending to its lowest level since 1951. According to the CBPP, the tax cuts Cruz has promised would reduce federal tax revenue to levels that \u201care simply too low\u201d for the demands of the country today, and would create \u201ca long-term deficit nightmare\u201d if not offset by massive cuts to federal spending. Those spending cuts would, in turn, result in \u201cextraordinarily severe cuts to programs vital to low- and middle-income Americans.\u201d [Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 3/29/16]\n\nTax Policy Center: Cruz Plan Would Balloon Deficit By $8.6 Trillion Through Massive Tax Cuts For The Wealthy. According to a February 15 analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, Cruz\u2019s tax reform proposals \u201cwould reduce federal revenue by $8.6 trillion\u201d over their first decade -- resulting in \u201cpersistently large, and likely unsustainable, budget deficits\u201d -- while \u201creducing taxes dramatically for households at the very top of the income distribution\u201d:\n\nSenator Cruz\u2019s tax reform plan would repeal the corporate income tax and the payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare, impose a new VAT, cut the individual income tax rate to 10 percent for all taxpayers, remove almost all taxation of investment income, and repeal many tax expenditures. It would boost incentives to work, save, and invest and would simplify the tax code. At the same time, the proposal would significantly change the distribution of federal tax burdens by reducing taxes dramatically for households at the very top of the income distribution and by providing little change or even higher taxes for households at the bottom of the distribution. In addition, barring extraordinarily large cuts in government spending or future tax increases, it would yield persistently large, and likely unsustainable, budget deficits. [Tax Policy Center, 2/15/16]\n\nThe Atlantic: \u201cEconomists Agree That The Gold Standard Is A Bad Idea.\u201d A November 11 article in The Atlantic pushed back on Cruz\u2019s remarks during a Republican presidential debate the night before, during which the candidate expressed his support for \u201ckeeping our money tied to a stable level of gold.\u201d The article demonstrated that \u201cin general, economists agree that the gold standard is a bad idea,\u201d and argued that it would be \u201cquite dangerous\u201d for the economy. It also pointed out that hedge fund manager and gold standard enthusiast Robert Mercer has \u201cdonated millions to four super PACs affiliated with Cruz's campaign.\u201d [The Atlantic, 11/11/15]\n\nHuffPo: Cruz\u2019s Embrace Of The Gold Standard Is \u201cA Good Way To Run A Modern Economy Into The Ground.\u201d While other outlets focused on the tax cut portion of Cruz\u2019s proposal to boost economic growth far beyond historic averages, an April 17 article by Huffington Post business reporter Ben Walsh spotlighted Cruz\u2019s claim that returning to the gold standard would spur the economy. The article noted that economists and monetary policy experts overwhelming oppose the gold standard -- \u201ca hare-brained policy that no other country uses\u201d -- because it would contribute to wild economic swings driven by fluctuating market prices:\n\nThat\u2019s great, you might think: the value of the dollar will be stable. But the exact opposite is true; gold is a commodity and its price, driven by supply and demand and speculation, swings wildly. Under the gold standard, a central bank like the Federal Reserve would have to raise and cut interest rates not based on how well the economy is doing, but what\u2019s going on in the gold market. It\u2019s a good way to run a modern economy into the ground. (The inflexibility of the gold standard caused the Great Depression.) And yet Cruz thinks the gold standard is a great policy. [...] He expressed support for this very dangerous idea at Republican debates in October and November, too. \u201cWe had it for about 170 years of our nation\u2019s history, and enjoyed booming economic growth and lower inflation than we have had with the Fed now,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe need to get back to sound money.\u201d [The Huffington Post, 4/17/16]\n\nCRS: Tax Cuts For The Wealthy Do Not Affect Economic Growth, Contribute To Inequality. According to a September 14, 2012, report by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), reductions in top income tax rates over the previous 65 years did not correlate with increased economic growth, but lowering top rates does \"appear to be associated with the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution.\" On November 1, 2012, The New York Times reported that Senate Republicans suppressed the CRS findings, which debunked \"a central tenet of conservative economic theory.\u201d [Congressional Research Service, 9/14/12; The New York Times, 11/1/12]\n\nBrookings: Tax Cuts For The Wealthy May Actually Reduce Economic Activity. According to a September 2014 report from the Brookings Institution, tax cuts do not always create economic growth, and they can even discourage growth by undermining economic incentives to invest.
