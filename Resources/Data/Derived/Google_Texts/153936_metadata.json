Wade, women of color are five times as likely to terminate a pregnancy as their white counterparts. Why?\n\nIn 2005, Renee Bracey Sherman, then 19, sat in the abortion clinic alone. A jumble of concerns ran through her mind. She didn\u2019t feel ready for a baby, but still, she worried that her parents would be disappointed in her choice. More than anything, though, she didn\u2019t want to be a statistic, another pregnant black teen. \u201cIn the moment, you never know who your allies are,\u201d Bracey Sherman said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to take the chance of everyone judging you at a moment when you\u2019re so vulnerable. There\u2019s a very unfortunate stereotype of women of color, and black women in particular, that we are promiscuous and just have babies. You don\u2019t want that to be you.\u201d An African-American woman is almost five times likelier to have an abortion than a white woman, and a Latina more than twice as likely, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate of abortion among American women is currently at its lowest point since Roe v. Wade, according to a recent report by the Guttmacher Institute. About 1.1 million abortions were performed in 2011, at a rate of 16.9 abortions for every 1,000 women of childbearing age, down from a peak of 29.3 per 1,000 in 1981. Since the report\u2019s release in February, the reason why has been the subject of much debate. Its authors and abortion-rights supporters point to the increase in contraceptive use and sexual education, while anti-abortion activists counter that the decrease is a result of abstinence-only teachings and state restrictions.\n\nLargely missing from the debate, though, is discussion of abortion\u2019s racial disparity: Although rates among Hispanic and African-American women have decreased along with the rest of the country, they remain significantly higher than the national average. \"There\u2019s a very unfortunate stereotype of women of color, and black women in particular, that we just have babies.\" Christine Dehlendorf, a professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) who specializes in reproductive health research, said that the discrepancy is reflective of the broader inequities people of color face in every arena. \u201cThere are a multitude of reasons, and we don\u2019t fully understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d Dehlendorf said. \u201cBut ultimately I think it\u2019s about structural determinants\u2014 economic reasons, issues related to racism, differences in opportunities, differences in social and historical context.\u201d She emphasized that money is often a decisive factor. The median wealth of white households is 18 times that of Hispanic households and 20 times that of black households, according to the Pew Research Center, but across the board, low-income women have a higher rate of unintended pregnancy and abortion regardless of race. They are less likely to have health insurance or consistent access to healthcare, and therefore birth control, according to a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The Guttmacher report credited the increase in popularity of contraceptive intrauterine devices (IUDs) with contributing to the decline of the abortion rate. IUDs are among the longest-lasting and most effective methods of birth control\u2014but they\u2019re also among the most expensive, and therefore not an option for many low-income women. Yet black women still have higher rates of abortion even when controlling for income, according to a 2008 report by the Guttmacher Institute. At almost every income level, African-Americans have higher unintended pregnancy and abortion rates than whites or Hispanics.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even as the U.S. abortion rate is at its lowest since Roe v.
