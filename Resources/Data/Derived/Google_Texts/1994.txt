From a press release:

WLOS ABC 13 will host a “Your Voice, Your Future” Town Hall on “The Heroin Epidemic in WNC” at the WNC Ag Center in Fletcher on Thursday, April 21. The event will feature four panelists, invited guests and members of the general public.

The purpose of the Town Hall is to raise awareness about heroin addiction and the alarming overdose rate in our mountain counties. It is our goal to bring our health care professionals, law enforcement, elected officials and citizens affected by heroin addiction under one roof for an informative discussion about the heroin epidemic in WNC.

The live program starts at 7:30pm. It will last 90 minutes and will be streamed live at www.wlos.com and broadcast live on channel 13.3. Doors at the Virginia Boone Building open at 6:00pm.

Host of “Behind the Headlines,” Mark Hyman, will moderate the event. News 13’s Frank Fraboni will be on the Digital Desk, with questions and comments from social media.

News 13 has held previous town hall events on domestic violence, community police relations, same sex marriage, the Affordable Care Act, and gun laws.

The public and media are invited to attend the free event. For more information, contact Julie Fries at fries@sbgtv.com 0r 651-4571.
