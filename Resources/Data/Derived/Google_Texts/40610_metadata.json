No matter: a handful of faraway national political battles carry enormous importance for the state, and the high stakes may be summed up with a few names and numbers:\n\nSupreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, age 82\n\nSupreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, age 78\n\nSupreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, age 78\n\nWhy it matters: At first glance, the high probability that Republicans will seize control of the Senate may seem to Californians with\u2026you know, actual lives\u2026little more than yet another partisan, inside-the-Beltway, tit-for-tat drama, of genuine interest only to elected officials, lobbyists, political hacks, professional media blowhards, plus assorted plutocrats and greed heads.\n\nConservative corporate interests, Tea Party populists and denizens of the right-wing \u201cnews\u201d bubble have treated President Obama\u2019s presidency as illegitimate from his first day in office, an obstructionist stance that greatly deepened when the GOP won control of the House in the 2010 mid-terms. With Republicans already effectively stonewalling and shutting down his every action, idea and utterance, reflexively and in lockstep, what practical difference would it make if they do so more loudly?\n\nAs David Leonhardt argues persuasively in \u201cThe Upshot,\u201d however, a GOP takeover of the Senate portends escalating trouble for progressives everywhere, in at least three key ways:\n\n\u2013Climate change: Thwarted by science deniers in Congress in his bid for a comprehensive national strategy, Obama more recently has used executive actions to impose lower carbon standards on power plants and automakers. Republican Senate leaders are already crowing about undoing these moves through federal budget ploys and schemes.\n\n\u2013Rear guard actions \u2013 House Republicans became a staple of late night TV jokes by futilely voting to roll back the Affordable Care Act 54 times in four years \u2013 (Bill Maher: \u201cThe Republicans in Congress voted to repeal Obamacare for a 40th time today. It\u2019s really now less a governing philosophy \u2013 it\u2019s more like Charlie Manson applying for parole\u201d). If the Senate joins their reactionary effort, not only against health care, but also by attacking the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and banking regulations, however, Obama would face a non-stop barrage of such efforts, with bitter political and legal trench warfare the most pleasant possible outcome.\n\n\u2013The judiciary. Actuarial tables suggest at least one sitting Supreme Court justice will die or retire in the president\u2019s final two years in office, so it\u2019s worth comparing the type of replacement Obama \u2013 or his successor \u2014 might get through the Democratic Senate with one able to win approval from a Republican-dominated, um, World\u2019s Greatest Deliberative Body, at a time when the conservative court has moved the country ever further rightward on a host of ideological issues since it hijacked the 2000 presidential election. At least as important, Obama\u2019s ability to populate lower, but crucial federal circuit and appellate courts with moderates would be thoroughly hamstrung.\n\nFun with numbers: At least four major political websites have developed elaborate computerized statistical models to track the day-to-day odds of a Republican takeover, based on the latest polls and events. Frankly, however, trying to keep up with it all requires a full-time commitment to sitting in mom\u2019s basement in your jammies, staring into your Mac. We name no names.\n\nThe cheat sheet arithmetic is this: Democrats currently hold an effective 55-45 majority in the Senate, counting their members and two reliable Independents. This means that Republicans must win a net six seats in the 36 states with Senate elections next month.\n\nJust trust us on the preliminary calculus; then the deal comes down to who wins in five states \u2013 Alaska, Colorado, Iowa, North Carolina and Kansas. If GOP candidates win two of those five, they are all but guaranteed to capture the Senate.\n\nWriting in Beltway-speak, frenetic Washington Post political reporter Chris Cillizza, explains:\n\nOf the quartet of Democratic seats, North Carolina \u2014 somewhat amazingly \u2014 looks to be the toughest pickup for Republicans. Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), thanks at least in part to a spending edge on television over the last month or so, has managed to build a steady four-ish-point edge that state House Speaker Thom Tillis (R) has been unable to narrow. Republicans feel increasingly positive about Alaska \u2014 where the Chamber of Commerce released a poll this week showing Dan Sullivan (R), whom the group has endorsed, ahead of Sen. Mark Begich (D) by six points \u2014 and Colorado, where three straight polls show Rep. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) ahead. Iowa is, today, the purest toss up race in the country.\n\nBut for Republicans, Kansas has become a major headache. Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), having survived a contested primary in August, seemed to think reelection to a fourth term was ensured and stopped doing, well, much of anything. Meanwhile, independent businessman Greg Orman was spending seven figures on an August media buy that boosted him significantly. Democrat Chad Taylor\u2019s decision to drop out of the race \u2014 and the subsequent legal ruling that his name could be removed from the ballot \u2014 further endangers Roberts by coalescing the anti-Roberts vote.\n\nNo animals were harmed in the production of those two grafs.\n\nThe Obama factor \u2013 As a practical matter, the GOP\u2019s strongest weapon is Obama himself. Nearly every mid-term election boils down to a referendum on the president; this one\u2019s job performance and personal favorability ratings have plummeted since his 2012 re-election, due to a long, sad and familiar list of setbacks and failures, from the flawed roll-out of the Affordable Care Act website, to a series of ginned up Fox News \u201cscandals\u201d \u2013 Benghazi! Benghazi! Benghazi! \u2013 and a growing perception of presidential weakness, confusion and uncertainty on roiling national security matters around the world.\n\nThe GOP Senate strategy is simple: \u201cPresident Obama is not popular,\u201d Cillizza writes, wading deep into the weeds to explore the historic relationship between a president\u2019s stature and mid-term results. \u201cThe closer you can link a Democrat to Obama, the better.\u201d\n\nCloser to home: Although California Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer are not on the ballot, their political futures are very much on the line on November 4.\n\nThrough seniority, both have ascended to powerful positions in Washington, and at their ages \u2013 Feinstein, 81, and Boxer, 74 next month \u2013 would find returning to minority status a repulsive development. Rumors already are rife that Boxer will not seek re-election in 2016; Feinstein\u2019s term ends in 2018.\n\nIn an assessment of the situation, Carolyn Lochhead, longtime Capitol Hill reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, writes:\n\nBoxer, a key backer of the administration\u2019s controversial plan to cut carbon emissions from power plants, would cede the helm of the Environment and Public Works Committee to climate-change denier Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma.\n\nFeinstein would lose the chairmanship of the Intelligence Committee, where she has spearheaded a multiyear fight against the CIA to expose torture practices during the George W. Bush administration \u2014 a campaign that Republicans have boycotted.\n\nFeinstein, who long has played a central role in California\u2019s water fights, would also cede the chairmanship of the energy and water panel of the Appropriations Committee, which has given her outsize clout on water issues. The panel controls spending on every water project in the country.\n\nSo there\u2019s that.\n\nCan\u2019t tell the players without a scorecard: For those eager to surrender the next four weeks of their lives to scurrying down deep, online rabbit holes in pursuit of endless factoids and trivia about the great 2014 fight for the Senate, here are the go-to sites:\n\nElection Lab. The Washington Post\u2019s computer model tends to be the most bullish on Republican chances.\n\nThe Upshot. The New York Times model strongly leans Republican.\n\n538. The ESPN-owned site of idiot savant Nate Silver is recommended for serious gamblers.\n\nPrinceton Election Consortium. Princeton professor Sam Wang is an outlier, having consistently touted Democratic chances of hanging on to a majority; for junkies, his ongoing online feud with Silver on the subject is worth the price of admission.\n\nCaveat emptor.\n\n(A version of this column was published by the Santa Barbara Independent on Oct. 2)", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "California politics, news, analysis, commentary, opinion, California local and state politics, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento", "og": {"site_name": "Calbuzz", "description": "California plays no role in the biggest political story of the year, the Democrats\u2019 desperate struggle to hold off a Republican takeover of the Senate.
