Oh, doctor can you help me?\u201d Lipton (acting as Freud): \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Scheuermann: \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was a dream \u2026 geese \u2026 soul-sucked \u2026 I just want to go back to my mommy!\u201d Lipton: \u201cWell I\u2019ve seen this problem before. You want to have sex with your mother. It\u2019s called the Oedipus complex\u201d\n\nAfter a few more minutes of goofing around, Lipton said, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get us clowns off the stage and let you hear from the real speakers.\u201d\n\nThe event featured three Stanford neuroscience graduate students, Mariko Bennett, Pablo Jercog and Lief Fenno.\n\n\u201cOn my second time reading the Wikipedia article in preparation for tonight\u2026,\u201d the uproar of laughter drowns out Mariko Bennett\u2019s sarcasm.\n\nBennett is a short, spunky MD-Ph.D who studies the glial cells of the brain. She was strongly encouraged by the co-hosts to \u201ctalk about something of wide interest\u201d rather than her research.\n\nPablo Jercog, the energetic and heavily accented Argentinian, explained how the technologies he helps to create read the brain. The cover of the movie \u201cWhat Women Want\u201d flashed up on his slides. \u201cUnfortunately, all of this technology will definitely not help you solve that,\u201d he said, hardly audible amid the crowd\u2019s roaring laughter.\n\nAs soon as Fenno said that he would talk about the special senses of sharks, bats and snakes, the audience was hooked and willing to hear about the details of scientific studies.\n\nSilicon Valley is full of nerds like these.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard to describe oneself as a nerd in the valley,\u201d Fenno said, \u201cBecause everyone has an incredible intellectual curiosity but usually this comes with a lot of social savvy and these are almost inextricably linked to the local version of \u2018success.\u2019 It\u2019s just being normal.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bennett, Nerd Nite is so popular in Silicon Valley because \u201cif someone wrote a parody of a first date in Silicon Valley, after some brief dating site foreplay it would take place at \u2026 Nerd Nite, with the hero knowing more than the punk-ass speakers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe event had good community building, which science doesn\u2019t do much,\u201d said Thomas Rogerson, a postdoctoral scholar in biology and a spectator at the event.\n\nLipton, an event co-host, said, \u201cNerd Nites are all about nerds socializing with one another and learning from one another, talking about cool new ideas and technologies that can better our world and transform our world into a more exciting place.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt feeds by desire to be nosy and find needles in haystacks,\u201d said Marcus Wong, a senior manager at LinkedIn and attendee from outside the Stanford bubble.\n\nNerd Nite is part of a newly emerging definition of the nerd.\n\n\u201cNerd\u201d was first used in Dr. Seuss\u2019 1950 book \u201cIf I Ran the Zoo,\u201d in which Gerald McGrew collects \u201ca Nerkle, a Nerd, and a Seersucker too.\u201d\n\nBy the 1960s, the word was popularized all over the United States. Today, Wikipedia still defines nerd as \u201ca descriptive term, often used pejoratively indicating that a person is overly intellectual, obsessive, or socially impaired.\u201d\n\nTelevision shows such as \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d and \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d create nerd celebrities. Stanford branded itself as \u201cNerd Nation\u201d in 2012 when women\u2019s basketball star Chiney Ogwumike created the video \u201cNerd City Kids\u201d celebrating nerdism.\n\nThe rise of nerds means that people with technical knowledge are encouraged to communicate and socialize.\n\n\u201cThere has been a shift in the culture of science where scientists are now expected to be out there telling people what they do and fighting off this stereotype of the weird eccentric scientist who can\u2019t speak to people and doesn\u2019t want to speak to people,\u201d says Balakrishnan, one of the founders of Nerd Nite.\n\n\u201cIn general, the onus should be on scientists to communicate their work as widely as possible, so I hope that Nerd Nite continues to provide a forum for this to happen,\u201d says Fenno.\n\nUltimately, all the attendees of Nerd Nite are nerds solely because they are curious.\n\nAs Scheuermann said, \u201cA nerd is someone who loves learning for the sake of learning. I need no reward, no degree, no job, to motivate me. I just love to learn!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Chris Balakrishnan,Julia Turan,nerd,Nerd Nite,Nerd Nite Silicon Valley,nerds,Silicon Valley,Culture & Features,Features,Frontpage Featured,Science & Tech", "description": "In early June, the third local event of the international nonprofit Nerd Nite was held in Palo Alto.
