The woman worked for the Women\u2019s Bureau for the U.S. Department of Labor, and Mrs. Brooks thought she would one day like to have that job. More than 20 years later, she discovered the position was available and got it.\n\nShe worked as regional administrator for the Women\u2019s Bureau for the U.S. Department of Labor until she retired in 2012. She was responsible for Texas. Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas and New Mexico and worked to make sure women were treated equally in the workforce. They held conferences and provided information and more than anything, they educated women about what their rights were.\n\n\u201cI liked most the opportunity to help women succeed,\u201d she said of the job.\n\nShe represented the United States at the International Labor Conference in Switzerland in 2009.\n\nMrs. Brooks, 70, grew up in Tyler and graduated from Emmett Scott High School. She left her hometown in 1962 to attend Hampton University in Virginia and Bishop College in Dallas, both historically black colleges. She studied sociology and later went to Texas Southern University in Houston.\n\nMrs. Brooks worked as a social worker in New Jersey and New York before living for more than a year in Germany with her now ex-husband while he was in the military.\n\nShe moved to Houston, where she worked as project director for the minority Women Employment Program, funded by the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really impacted who I became career wise,\u201d she said. Through special recruitment efforts and counseling, they worked to break the barrier of minority women not serving in managerial roles in the workplace, she said. After serving as project director in Houston, she worked for the organization for five years in Atlanta.\n\nMrs. Brooks said she learned how to sell herself because she had the responsibility of selling others. She also learned how to negotiate salaries, learned leadership skills and how to manage people and situations.\n\nAfter a decade, she moved to Dallas and owned a full-service telephone answering service business for seven years before she sold it and went to work for what is now Bank of America. She started out as a community investment officer, ensuring that the minority and business communities were being served by the bank, she said. She also worked in Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta, and when she left Bank of America after 12 years, she was senior vice president.\n\nIn 2005, she attended the Senior Executive Fellows Program, Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.\n\nAfter 13 years of working for the Women\u2019s Bureau for the U.S. Department of Labor, Mrs. Brooks retired two years ago and returned to Tyler. She reconnected at a school reunion with her eighth-grade boyfriend, Willie Brooks, and the two have been married for seven years.\n\nIt is the volunteer work she has done since being back in Tyler that got her honored in March as The 16th annual Women in Tyler luncheon honored six women in March for being \u201cWomen Who Care.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt made me feel pretty special because I had not been here that long,\u201d she said. \u201cI think part of the reason I was nominated was because of my work I did with women.\u201d\n\nMrs. Brooks is a graduate of Leadership Texas Class 2000 and has received several awards from national and local organizations, mostly for her work with the Women\u2019s Bureau.\n\nAmong her awards are Women Changing the World from Texas College; the Community Service Award, National Council of Negro Women, Dallas & New Orleans Chapters; Certificate of Congressional Recognition; Atlanta Business League, Top 100 Black Women of Influence in Atlanta; Certificate of Commendation for contributions to Small Business Development, U.S. Department of Commerce, Small Business Development Agency; and Outstanding Woman Entrepreneur, Black Business and Professional Women\u2019s Clubs.\n\nIn Tyler, she co-founded an all-white Labor Day party called Party with a Purpose, which raises money for charities. She said they hope to raise more than $5,000 this year for Texas College.\n\nMrs. Brooks also is involved with Battleground Texas, an offshoot of the National Democratic Party, trying to turn Texas blue and educate the public about the importance of voting, she said. She also is managing the campaign of her brother who is running for re-election as Justice of the Peace Precinct 1 Quincy Beavers.\n\nShe plans to start a leadership academy to help a small group of middle school-aged black boys. She said it will be a multifaceted program that will include tutorial, leadership, scheduling and athletic components. She plans to name it after community leaders \u2014 the Noble E. Young and Asa G. Hillard Leadership Academy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do what I do for recognition,\u201d she said. \u201cI do what I do because it makes me feel good.\u201d Mrs. Brooks said she has lived a very full life and being honored makes her feel like she is doing what God wants her to do.\n\nThe other women who were chosen as Women in Tyler this year were Jennifer Carson, Jean Coleman, Verna Hall, Irma Rodriguez and Rebecca Taylor.\n\nIf you know of a professional woman or business service in the Tyler area that should be highlighted in this column, contact cmurphy@tylerpaper.com.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "TylerPaper.com", "description": "Beverly Beavers Brooks always has had a desire to help women achieve.
