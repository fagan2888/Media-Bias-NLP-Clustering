Saturday’s high winds are only a prelude to stronger gusts expected Sunday afternoon that could reach 50 mph and make it tougher to lob a touchdown pass or kick a long field goal.

“I can’t comment on how Peyton (Manning) is going to perform in the wind,” said Dave Barjenbruch, meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Boulder. “There are going to be swirling winds.”

Wind gusts were reaching as high as 40 mph Saturday, making balmy temperatures into the high 50s, seem a lot cooler, Barjenbruch said. Sunday temperatures are expected to rise only to the mid-40s, he said.

The foothills are under a high-wind advisory through the weekend, with winds expecting to gust up to 80 mph.

Skiers heading to the mountains Sunday will encounter blizzardlike conditions. The next major weather system is expecting to reach Steamboat Springs by about 2 a.m. Sunday, Barjenbruch said.

A winter storm warning will be in effect from late Saturday through Sunday, said Barjenbruch. Heavy snow accompanied by high winds will combine to make treacherous driving with whiteout conditions.

“Use caution,” he urged. “It’s going to be very difficult driving conditions. The commute into the mountains will be slow and frustrating for skiers.”

Mountain ski communities already have received about a foot of snow the past two days and could get at least that much before the end of Sunday. Vail received 16 inches of snow the past two days.
