WASHINGTON, D.C. (WTAP)-It's a budget package both political parties, and the president, agree on.

But that doesn't mean everyone agrees with the spending package Congress approved Friday.

The "omnibus" budget bill is a spending package totalling more than a trillion dollars, with 680 billion dollars in tax cuts during the next ten years.

It passed the Senate overwhelmingly, but the vote in the House was closer.

Ohio Congressman Bill Johnson says the package isn't perfect, but has what he called conservative victories.

" It increases military spending in this time of increased terror threats, and it reforms the visa waiver program to put more security into who is being allowed in our country."

They include no new funding for the EPA and the Affordable Care Act.

But West Virginia's David McKinley was concerned funding benefiting coal miners wasn't included.

"There had been some hope, a promise, a 'we'll work with you' concept. I don't know that many of our families have time to wait two or three years for things to come into play."

Ohio Senator Rob Portman also voted against the bill, saying it included too much spending in a time of high defecits and record debt.

The loudest criticism came from West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, who also stated the bill should have included protection for miners benefits.

Manchin said it also included what he called Christmas presents for wealthy people, without addressing long-term spending and debt problems.

Manchin's West Virginia colleague, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, who voted for the bill, stated it included significant funding to enhance national security, combat the drug epidemic and expand access to affordable broadband.

President Obama, who is expected to sign the legislation, says the budget invests in the U.S. military and the middle class.
