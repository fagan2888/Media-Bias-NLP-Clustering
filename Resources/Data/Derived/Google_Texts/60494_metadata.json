But how do we as a free people respond to judicial tyranny at the Supreme Court\u2019s conflict with the Constitution and its lack of redemption?\n\nThe bellwether of our legal system is that 90 percent of attorneys are incompetent; they go on to become judges who are incompetent and from whose ranks incompetent Supreme Court justices (like Roberts) are chosen. As our republic fails, the blame can be laid squarely on our Supreme Court, the final arbiter of our rights.\n\nWe in the United States were never to be governed by money, but that has not been the vision of our final arbitrator, which has ruled that corporations are equal to people (Citizens United) and that the federal government can assess us with penalties and call it a tax, albeit an unlawful tax (Affordable Care Act). Ever since the passage of the 14th Amendment, the extreme wings of our political system have taken the view that it is their purpose to protect big business from the states and us. Accordingly, diversity statutes are being used to take litigation from state interests and remove them to the federal system in step with federal interests, which have traditionally sided with big business like banking, insurance, oil, and any other major business that operates across state lines.\n\nBut even these rulings are mild in the scope of this court\u2019s redundant history of being stacked against our Constitution.\n\nThe cloud that hangs over this court demonstrates its usefulness as a tool of oppression, going all the way back to the appointments of Justices Joseph Bradley and William Strong by President Grant to change the outcome and ruling in the legal tender cases, which held that paper currency could not under our constitution be a legal tender for the payment of debts.\n\nSome history\n\nFirst, understand that paper notes are a representative currency. They represent dollars, but they are not dollars themselves. We use representative words to define objects.\n\nFor example, define a foot: A foot represents 12 inches. Define a yard: A yard represents three feet. Now, define a dollar.\n\nThe Coinage Act of April 2, 1792, established the United States Mint and regulated the coinage of the United States. Under this act, Congress established the silver dollar as the unit of money in the United States, declared it to be lawful tender, and created a decimal system for U.S. currency.\n\nThe dollar as defined by Congress may be found at Title 31, Section 5112 of the U.S. Codes. For example, the silver dollar consists of 31.103 grams (1 troy ounce) of 0.999 percent pure silver (see Section 5112 at [e], [1], and [2]). These constitutional metrics are the only constitutionally defined dollars. The paper currency is merely a representative currency. Article 1, Section 8 gives Congress this mandate.\n\nDuring the Civil War, with the Northern treasury lacking the finances to carry it on, President Lincoln nominated Salmon P. Chase as secretary of the treasury to find a way to finance the war. Chase created the U.S. Notes and made them legal tender in payment of all debts public and private. Then to insure the constitutionality of the Legal Tender Act, Lincoln appointed Chase as chief justice of the Supreme Court. But Chase surprised everyone when he wrote the decision in a challenge to the paper notes, Hepburn v. Griswold, 75 U.S. 603 (1870), declaring that under the Constitution paper notes could not be a legal tender, being in conflict with Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nTo overrule this decision, Grant appointed Bradley and Strong, two railroad attorneys, to the Supreme Court, increasing the number of justices to nine, and the same question was brought back before the court in its next term when Knox v. Lee, 79 U.S. 457 (1871) reversed Hepburn v. Griswold.\n\nBased on this president we now exclusively have a paper note as a legal tender, paper that is not backed by anything but our good faith in the government. The difference is that the U.S. Notes were a tax against us in favor of the government; they were also redeemable in lawful dollars. The Federal Reserve Notes are a tax against us by a private banking system for the benefit of the large banking interests, the Wall Street banks who we pay an interest to \u2014 first to the Fed, which then apportions it among its members \u2014 for the use of this essentially valueless paper. Granted, some of this interest is returned to our treasury, but the bulk is divided as spoils among the member banks. Additionally, these Federal Reserve Notes are redeemable in nothing; they circulate as Federal Reserve obligations only. So what is their value? We might as well trade cowry shells.\n\nBetter yet, let\u2019s go back to using U.S. Notes and bypass the banks\u2019 stranglehold over our lives through their debt currency and phony interest obligation.\n\nA deviation from constitutional law, the Federal Reserve System also raises additional concerns: If Congress is mandated to coin the money and determine its value, does that allow Congress to give away this important constitutional obligation to a private money system?\n\nThe Supreme Court was stacked by Grant and treason was committed, but this is only one case I have documented. How many others exist? What additional usurpations have we been made to endure?\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s perceptible mandate has been to protect big business interest at the extent of smothering the people\u2019s will. The Roberts court has demonstrated this progressive mentality, ruling against common sense in favor of pseudo-economic theories through pseudo-legal maneuvers even though not one member of this seditious court is an economist.\n\nWhen the Roberts court upheld the Affordable Care Act individual mandate as a tax, it actually overturned the constitutional mandate it swore to uphold and defend. As a lawyer, Roberts and the four liberals who supported him know that no governmental agency \u2014 not Congress, the executive branch, or even this treacherous court \u2014 has authority or power to tax us directly.\n\nThe income tax case of Pollock v. Farmers\u2019 Loan & Trust Company 157 U.S. 429 (1895), affirmed on rehearing (158 U.S. 601 [1895]), was a landmark ruling in which the Supreme Court held that the unapportioned income tax on interest, dividends, and rents imposed by the Income Tax Act of 1894 were in effect direct taxes and were unconstitutional because they violated the provision that direct taxes be apportioned (Article 1, Section 9, Clause 4).\n\nPollock v. Farmers\u2019 Loan & Trust Company is still valid law when direct taxes become an issue, as they did in the individual mandate, but because of the Sixteenth Amendment, it is no longer applicable to income taxes.\n\nRoberts\u2019s twisted argument is consistent with a moron attempting to defend himself and his erroneous view. Article 1, Section 9, clause 4 remains constitutional law even as Roberts ignores it.\n\n\u201cBy a vote of 5\u20134, the Court upheld the individual mandate of the ACA as a valid exercise of Congress\u2019s power to \u2018lay and collect taxes\u2019 (Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 1),\u201d Roberts, writing for the court, explained further:\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that certain individuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax. Because the Constitution permits such a tax, it is not our role to forbid it, or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness. \u201cFurther, the Court ruled that while the section 5000A penalty is treated as a tax for constitutional purposes, it is not a direct tax, and therefore is not required to be apportioned among the states according to population. The Court concluded: \u201cA tax on going without health insurance does not fall within any recognized category of direct tax \u2026 The shared responsibility payment is thus not a direct tax that must be apportioned among the several States.\u201d\n\nRoberts shared responsibility concept is a dangerous slope he descends. Under his socialist view, it could be used to force us to relinquish any amount of our income Congress deems necessary to feed and clothe our neighbors and individuals on welfare. We have no duty to share responsibility because Congress wants everyone insured. There is no congressional authority to impose this socialist concept on us! In fact, the Fifth Amendment forbids it.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment requires, \u201dnor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.\u201d Certainly it may not be taken for private use!\n\nThis notion of shared responsibility is the dream of Karl Marx taken right from his communist manifesto. It is the same concept Hillary Clinton advocates, that it takes a village to raise a child, and smacks of the socialist euphoria, \u201cFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his needs\u201d (shared responsibility).\n\nRoberts is a living illusion, a socialist fraud pretending to be a constitutionalist.\n\nThe taxing authority of our government\n\nArticle 1, Section 8, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution grants the federal government its power of taxation. This clause permits the levying of taxes for two purposes only: to pay the debts of the United States and to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States. Taken together, these purposes have traditionally been held to imply and to constitute the federal government\u2019s exclusive taxing and spending power. But this power is limited by Article 1, Section 9, Clause 4 of our Constitution, which precludes Congress and the Supreme Court from laying this tax directly against us, the individuals! Roberts failed to address this. His mischaracterization that this direct tax is not a direct tax is, to be kind, like a moron making an excuse for his idiocy.\n\nIt is an unconstitutional tax! And the Roberts court is fully aware of its treachery.\n\nRoberts and the four other \u201cjustices,\u201d in their circuitous thinking (four were liberals), would have us believe a tax that is assessed against the individual by Congress is not a direct tax. Then what is it? There are only four type of taxes known to mankind: excise taxes (which must be uniform among the states), duties, imposts (which don\u2019t apply here and which also must be uniform among the states), and direct taxes.\n\nAn excise tax is one that can be passed on to a consumer; a direct tax is one to be paid directly by an individual, which is how the individual mandate is carried out.\n\nTo be clear, the individual mandate is not an excise tax. It is not a duty laid or an impost tax. It is a direct tax against the individual laid because he failed to buy a required insurance, and no amount of deception or feigned ignorance from this court will change its makeup.\n\nWhile the liberal left of this court joined Roberts, Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito dissented.\n\nSo we have a federal court based on expediency and not the rule of law. To me, that is the very essence of tyranny. If we are to be ruled by political interests, then justice has become a mere illusion.\n\nConsider the words of Harvard law professor Noah Feldman: \u201cEvery generation gets the Constitution that it deserves. As the central preoccupations of an era make their way into the legal system, the Supreme Court eventually weighs in, and nine lawyers in robes become oracles of our national identity.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "But how do we as a free people respond to judicial tyranny at the Supreme Court\u2019s conflict with the Constitution and its lack of redemption?", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Jack Ferm", "og": {"site_name": "The Independent | St George Cedar Zion Utah Mesquite NV News & Events", "description": "But how do we as a free people respond to judicial tyranny at the Supreme Court\u2019s conflict with the Constitution and its lack of redemption?", "title": "The Supreme Court\u2019s conflict with the Constitution - The Independent | St George Cedar Zion Utah Mesquite NV News & Events", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1070, "identifier": "http://suindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/supreme-court-546279_1280-copy.jpg", "height": 673}, "updated_time": "2016-02-04T10:09:21-06:00", "url": "http://suindependent.com/supreme-courts-conflict-constitution/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "But how do we as a free people respond to judicial tyranny at the Supreme Court\u2019s conflict with the Constitution and its lack of redemption?", "creator": "@SUindependent", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/suindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/supreme-court-546279_1280-copy.jpg?fit=1070%2C673", "title": "The Supreme Court\u2019s conflict with the Constitution - The Independent | St George Cedar Zion Utah Mesquite NV News & Events", "site": "@SUindependent", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-02-04T10:00:39-06:00", "google-site-verification": "AsilA-83PwjAR3iq3ZEiPFK8P7SqqzC31qZ5udJMsaU", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/suindependent", "section": "Columns", "tag": "U.S Notes", "published_time": "2016-02-04T10:00:39-06:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T10:09:21-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Coinage Act of April 2, 1792, established the United States Mint and regulated the coinage of the United States.\nHis mischaracterization that this direct tax is not a direct tax is, to be kind, like a moron making an excuse for his idiocy.\nAs our republic fails, the blame can be laid squarely on our Supreme Court, the final arbiter of our rights.\nThen to insure the constitutionality of the Legal Tender Act, Lincoln appointed Chase as chief justice of the Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court was stacked by Grant and treason was committed, but this is only one case I have documented."}
