Since then, he has been restricted to treating male patients under an emergency order from the Florida Department of Health.\n\nDr. Esmailzadeh\u2019s attorney, Gregory Eisenmenger, asked the board to allow his client to continue practicing under the men-only constraint. But the board unanimously rejected that request.\n\n\u201cThe facts of this case are serious and egregious,\u201d said Dr. Nabil el-Sanadi, a board member. Records show that the pain doctor sometimes molested his patients while they were immobilized, as he was injecting drugs into their spine.\n\nEsmailzadeh, 49, had denied the charges both in previous hearings and in comments on Thursday to Health News Florida. He said nothing during Friday\u2019s hearing and declined to comment afterward. His attorney said they will appeal the decision through the court system.\n\nBefore the vote, the three patients all asked the board to bar Esmailzadeh from practice.\n\n\u201cHe took away the trust a patient should have in doctors,\u201d said a patient identified only by her initials, M.E. She said she always takes someone with her now when she has to see a physician.\n\nAnother patient, identified as B.K., said she thinks about what Esmailzadeh did to her every day. She no longer likes to touch others or be touched.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to be sure he is never allowed to bring this pain to other patients,\u201d she said. \u201cI fear he will do this again and ruin others\u2019 lives.\u201d\n\nIn revoking Esmailzadeh\u2019s license, board members followed the recommendation from Administrative Law Judge R. Bruce McKibben, who held hearings on the matter in September.\n\n\u201cBy all accounts, (Esmailzadeh) is a skilled and proficient pain management physician,\u201d wrote McKibben, but that \u201cdoes not excuse his behavior.\u201d\n\nThe doctor, who lives in Viera, had testified that the women were mistaken; what they felt rubbing against them was probably syringes in his lab-coat pocket, he said.\n\nThe doctor\u2019s testimony was so implausible, McKibben wrote, that it \u201cwas, frankly, insulting to a person of average intelligence.\u201d\n\nReached by phone on Thursday, Esmailzadeh said he hoped for vindication but expected the board to vote for revocation. He said the charges had left him unemployed and \u201cdevastated.\u201d\n\nEsmailzadeh worked at Melbourne\u2019s Back Authority for Contemporary Knowledge \u2013 usually called \u201cThe Back Center\u201d \u2013 from January 2008 to September 2011, state records say. The medical director there fired him after receiving a number of complaints from women patients, the records say.\n\nOne of the patients called police, records show, but the officer believed Esmailzadeh's denial. That enabled the doctor to get another job.\n\nFrom March 2012 through April 2013, Esmailzadeh worked at Advantacare Clinics in Daytona Beach and Altamonte Springs. He was fired after the Department of Health issued its order restricting his practice, according to a television news report at the time.\n\nIn December 2013, as Health News Florida reported at the time, his attorney and the Department of Health prosecutors agreed to settle the case with a reprimand, $20,000 fine, and continued restriction on his license.\n\nBut the medical board refused to accept the settlement. \u201cThis is a bad actor, a real bad actor,\u201d then-Board Chair Zach Zachariah said. The vote set the stage for the hearing before McKibben.\n\nAlso, the board early Friday voted to allow doctors to charge $1 a page for copies of medical records.\n\n--Special correspondent Carol Gentry is part of WUSF in Tampa.
