Tom Coburn\u2019s (R., Okla.) annual Wastebook was released Tuesday, detailing billions in frivolous government spending on everything from wine to romance novels.\n\nAs the federal debt surpassed $17 trillion in 2013, Coburn\u2019s office named its top 100 examples of government waste, which cost taxpayers more than $30 billion this year.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to spending your money,\u201d Coburn wrote, \u201cthose in Washington tend to see no waste, speak no waste, and cut no waste.\u201d\n\nThe examples are numerous, including a $150,000 zombie game created to teach kids math and $40,810 to hire an Inventory Manager at the \u201cDenver Museum of Miniatures, Dolls and Toys,\u201d which features exhibits on miniature trains, and giant teddy bears.\n\nThe 167-page report compares the Obamacare launch to \u201cNew Coke,\u201d tallying the total cost for the glitch-ridden website and promotion for the law at $379 million. Coburn uses the $319 million figure for Healthcare.gov\u2014the most conservative estimate for the cost to build the website\u2014and $60 million for advertising.\n\nThe $10 million Oregon received to push the law includes advertisements that do not even mention the word \u201cinsurance.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Portland advertising agency North, Inc., did produce a psychedelic cartoon ad that \u201cfeatures what appears to be Gumby riding on the Beatles\u2019 yellow submarine\u201d to promote Cover Oregon.\n\nThe Oregon marketplace had only enrolled 44 people as of Nov. 30.\n\nOther federally funded advertising campaigns have not proven much more successful. \u201cColorado\u2019s $20 million Obamacare campaign, which features an Elvis impersonator, has signed up fewer than 4,000 enrollees including one dog named Baxter,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe National Endowment of the Humanities (NEH) spent nearly $1 million to promote romance novels, including a $616,000 documentary \u201cLove Between the Covers,\u201d a website, and a traveling exhibit.\n\nThe $914,000 grant was meant to \u201cexplore the fascinating, often contradictory origins and influences of popular romance as told in novels, films, comics, advice books, songs, and Internet fan fiction, taking a global perspective\u2014while looking back across time as far as the ancient Greeks.\u201d\n\nThe website recently asked if Edward from the Twilight series was \u201cromantic or controlling?\u201d\n\nOther examples of misguided government spending included $1.9 million for \u201clifestyle coaching\u201d for Senate staff and $1.5 billion for the maintenance of vacant federal buildings.\n\nThe Justice Department spends $626,250 so its employees can use travel agents instead of booking online, and the Postal Service paid \u201cfuturist\u201d Faith Popcorn $836 an hour for advice on the future of stamps, amassing a bill of $566,000.\n\nSixty-five million dollars in intended Hurricane Sandy relief went to tourism ads, while only one victim to date has received housing assistance in Staten Island.\n\nFunding also went to research projects that study duck penises ($384,989) and how to use human urine as fertilizer ($15,000).\n\nThe Wastebook noted the results of a similar project: \u201cA 2007 study conducted in Finland \u2026 found cabbage fertilized with urine grew faster and larger but that sauerkraut produced from the cabbage grown in urine tasted different.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. taxpayer also subsidized a hefty amount of alcohol production in 2013. The Alaskan Brewing Company received $450,000 for a \u201cnew environmentally friendly boiler,\u201d $200,000 was spent to double production at a winery in Oklahoma, and $100,000 went towards a distillery that makes yam vodka in North Carolina.\n\nThe report also focuses on waste in the Pentagon\u2019s budget, including a $9 million reality television series for the Army and a $34 million military headquarters in Afghanistan that will never be used.\n\nThe Department of Defense also destroyed $7 billion worth of useable military equipment in Afghanistan rather than selling it or shipping it home.\n\nAnother target is NASA, with the report finding over $4.1 million in wasteful projects over the past year.\n\nWhile no manned missions to space are planned, NASA spent $360,000 paying people to \u201clie around and do nothing\u201d for a study on weightlessness in space.\n\nThe agency spent $3 million for a seminar on \u201chow the legislative process really works\u201d in Congress; $237,205 to study red crabs; and $390,000 to create a cartoon superhero, the \u201cGreen Ninja,\u201d to teach children about global warming.\n\nThe character fights his archenemies \u201cplastic man, coal man, and junky corporate man.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are only a few of the 100 examples of government mismanagement and stupidity included in Wastebook 2013,\u201d Coburn writes. \u201cCollectively these cost more than $30 billion in a year when Washington would have you believe everything that could be done has been done to control unnecessary spending.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad just these 100 been eliminated, the sequester amount would have been reduced nearly a third without any noticeable disruption,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
