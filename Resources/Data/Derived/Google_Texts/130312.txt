How did you spend your Memorial Day weekend? Someone spent theirs defacing rock art dubbed “Pregnant Buffalo” at Nine Mile Canyon in Utah.

The suspect carved the initials “JMN” and the date “5/25/14” into the dark patina next to the buffalo carving that is more than 1,000 years old. Worse still, the vandalism happened just minutes after archaeologist Jerry D. Spangler inspected the site for vandalism and saw none, reported Deseret News.

“Each act of vandalism is a selfish disregard of the aesthetic, spiritual and scientific values that constitute our collective past,” Spangler, executive director of the Colorado Plateau Archaeological Alliance, told Deseret News. “These sites are non-renewable resources, and the damage done can never be completely repaired.”

Spangler also said the damage happened at about 12:20 p.m. on May 25. About 20 minutes after that two local property owners visited the site and saw two people scurrying away.

According to The Salt Lake Tribune, federal officials from the Bureau of Land Management are in contact with two suspects but would not provide any more details.

The canyon where the damage occurred is actually 40 miles long, and has been dubbed the world’s longest art gallery. Some 10,000 images are believed to date between 900 and 1250 A.D. in the canyon.
