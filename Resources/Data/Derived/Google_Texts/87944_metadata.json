In that respect, there are winners and losers, as the tax favors the big business that handles more links in the supply chain itself instead of relying on others who then get taxed,\u201d Yamachika said.\n\nEconomist Arthur Laffer, Heritage Foundation chief economist Stephen Moore, and Jonathan Williams, director of the Tax and Fiscal Policy Task Force at the American Legislative Exchange Council, wrote \u201cRich States, Poor States.\u201d\n\nHawaii received other notable mentions.\n\nThe state is ranked 48th with a marginal personal income tax rate of 11 percent. Just two other states have higher income taxes. New York, at 12.7 percent, is 49th, and California, 5oth, comes in at 13.3 percent.\n\nFor combined federal corporate tax and state corporate tax rates, Hawaii is listed at 39.2 percent or 2.4 percent below the worst state\u2014Iowa at 41.6 percent.\n\nIn overall economic outlook, Hawaii was 40th.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Sam Slom, a Republican, said he has serious concerns about Hawaii\u2019s economic outlook.\n\n\u201cWhy then, does our Legislature continue to have the highest sales tax burden and some of the highest personal income tax rates in the nation. When is our government going to get it?\u201d Slom asked. \u201cYou can\u2019t overtax the people to support bad spending habits, and then expect people to stay and invest in our state.\u201d\n\nSlom, the only Republican in the 25-member Senate, said he consistently introduces bills to alleviate these burdens, but the majority has blocked his efforts.\n\nRead more on Watchdog.org.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "HONOLULU\u2014Hawaii ranks worst in three major categories in the seventh annual \u201cRich States, Poor States\u201d report, which tracks states\u2019 economic policies based on 15 policy areas.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "HONOLULU\u2014Hawaii ranks worst in three major categories in the seventh annual \u201cRich States, Poor States\u201d report, which tracks states\u2019 economic policies based on 15 policy areas.", "title": "Hawaii Ranks Worst for Sales Tax Burden", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/deppacific018422.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-21T00:05:03+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1DuS50w"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "HONOLULU\u2014Hawaii ranks worst in three major categories in the seventh annual \u201cRich States, Poor States\u201d report, which tracks states\u2019 economic policies based on 15 policy areas.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/deppacific018422.jpg"}, "title": "Hawaii Ranks Worst for Sales Tax Burden", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "taxes", "published_time": "2014-10-21T03:01:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-21T00:05:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "hawaii, economy, economic growth, rich sates poor states"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef81\"", "article_summary": "Tom Yamachika, president of the Tax Foundation of Hawaii, says Hawaii\u2019s general excise tax is \u201csneakier\u201d than a retail sales tax.\nHawaii has no sales tax; residents pay a general excise tax for goods and services, including food, medical services and medical prescriptions.\nThe state has the highest \u201csales\u201d tax in the nation\u2014about $42.62 per $1,000 of personal income is taken by the state\u2014and, when the excise tax is equated to sales tax, Hawaii has the single most burdensome tax on goods.\n\u201cWhy then, does our Legislature continue to have the highest sales tax burden and some of the highest personal income tax rates in the nation.\nHONOLULU\u2014Hawaii ranks worst in three major categories in the seventh annual \u201cRich States, Poor States\u201d report, which tracks states\u2019 economic policies based on 15 policy areas."}
