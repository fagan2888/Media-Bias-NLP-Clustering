A small \u201crain garden\u201d is planned to mist lounging students.\n\nMeanwhile, a company called the Aquatic Development Group, a purveyor of pool climbing walls, has installed a $1 million wave rider at Pensacola Christian College in Florida and is working with six other schools.\n\n\u201cA lot of students don\u2019t want to swim laps, but a leisure pool is a great equalizer: I can get my toes wet, I can play, I can study or I can go full in,\u201d said Jack Patton, who leads the sports-facilities group at RDG Planning and Design, an architecture firm in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nThe focus on pools for play comes with a shift in university rec centers from just places to sweat to more social spaces, complete with hangout areas.\n\nLaurie Braden, LSU\u2019s director of recreation, said today\u2019s students are more sophisticated about health and well-being.\n\n\u201cStudents \u2014 I don\u2019t know if demand is the right word \u2014 but certainly they expect that the amenities to help them have a balanced life will be in place.\u201d\n\nWith college costs climbing and outstanding student loan debt at a record $1.2 trillion, schools justify these facilities as important for recruitment and retention.\n\nAdministrators also like to point to studies conducted at Purdue University and Michigan State, which have shown that students who hit the gym do better academically than those who don\u2019t. Floating down a river is not exactly a major calorie burn, but that\u2019s not the point.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about our sedentary lifestyle today, if you can get some kid out on a zip line instead of playing video games and eating pizza, that\u2019s a huge win,\u201d said David Greusel of Convergence Design, whose projects have included a water slide at the University of Toledo.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/10/hffit14.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdba93\"", "article_summary": "At Auburn University in Alabama, for example, students can soak in a 45-person paw-print-shaped hot tub or scale a 20-foot wet climbing wall before plunging into the pool.\nIn the university recreation center arms race, the latest thing is to turn a piece of campus into something approaching a water theme park.\nLaurie Braden, LSU\u2019s director of recreation, said today\u2019s students are more sophisticated about health and well-being.\nWhen Louisiana State University surveyed students in 2009 to find out what they most wanted in their new recreation complex, one feature beat out even massage therapy: a lazy river.\nThe focus on pools for play comes with a shift in university rec centers from just places to sweat to more social spaces, complete with hangout areas."}
