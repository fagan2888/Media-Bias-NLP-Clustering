Hill had 32 points against the Warriors and was one of four Wildcats in double figures. Sam James added 12 points while Andrew Walker and Zane McKenzie each finished with 11.\n\nOn Saturday, McKenzie and Hill had 11 and 10 points, respectively, to lead the Wildcats to a 63-42 win over South Carolina\u2019s Swansea High. The Wildcats led the Tigers 21-19 at half before blowing the game open in the final two periods.\n\nSimilarly, the Wildcats trailed Jenkins 23-11 at the end of the first quarter before coming alive, and the Pirates led 34-20 at halftime. Despite the losses, RHHS coach Bill Henderson was upbeat about his team\u2019s performance so far during the Christmas break.\n\nThe Wildcats play Woodville Tompkins on Tuesday in the Metter Holiday Classic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve played fairly well over the break,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, we came out slow in every game ... (but) I was proud of the effort that the guys showed. We\u2019re able to play against good competition over the break, which will only help us down the road as we prepare for the region tournament.\u201d\n\nOf Richmond Hill\u2019s five losses, three have been in overtime and \u201ctwo of those three were at the buzzer,\u201d Henderson noted.\n\n\u201cI feel like the guys have learned a lot from those defeats, and hopefully, we can execute better in the second half of the season and close games out when we have the lead late,\u201d he said. \u201cThe guys are continuing to get better and are doing a good job of executing on both ends of the court.\n\nThey have been working hard in practice to make the improvements necessary for this team to be successful.\u201d\n\nThe Wildcats host Wayne County on Jan. 2 and then get back into Region 3-AAAAA play Jan. 5 at Brunswick. Richmond Hill is 3-1 in 3-AAAAA, trailing Effingham. Meanwhile the Richmond Hill girls picked up their first win of the season Saturday \u2014 and it was a runaway.\n\nThe Lady Wildcats (1-10) downed Windsor Forest 50-28 behind 13 points from Tiara Gandy, nine from Jamie Bunting, seven from Caitlin Elkins and six points and six rebounds from Jazlyn Martin.\n\nRichmond Hill also played close in a 47-43 loss to West Orange (Winter Park, Fla.) and a 49-42 setback at the hands of Bradwell Institute. Bunting led the scoring against West Orange with 15 points, while Martin added 11 points and six rebounds, Aubri Reed added nine points, and Elkins had eight points and seven rebounds.\n\nReed led a balanced scoring effort against BI, scoring nine. Kia Davis added seven and Gandy and Martin chipped each in six points each. Elkins finished with five points, eight rebounds and five blocks.\n\nFor coach Sarah Brown, the holiday performances are a sign the Lady Wildcats are getting better.\n\n\u201cWe are getting on the right track and playing more as a team, which is going to be big as we get back into region play,\u201d she said.\n\nBCHS\n\nBryan County High School\u2019s Lady Redskins lost one and won one over the weekend.\n\nThe Lady Redskins (6-4 overall) fell 40-33 to host Claxton on Saturday, despite getting 13 points and eight rebounds from Julianne Brown, 12 points and four assists from Kaylin Leggett, and six points and seven rebounds from Yaz Crawford. Both teams started slow before Claxton opened up a 19-12 halftime lead.\n\nBryan County came back in the third quarter, but couldn\u2019t seal the win.\n\n\u201cWe battled back in the fourth quarter. We couldn\u2019t get the lead back.\u201d said BCHS coach Mario Mincey, who called the loss \u201ca tough one.\u201d\n\nIf Saturday was tough, Friday was a walk in the park for BCHS, which blew out Region 2-AA foe Bacon County 53-10 at home. Brown had 22 points, 10 rebounds and five assists, while Alyssa Edwards added 11 points and three steals. Crawford chipped in eight points and pulled down\n\n11 rebounds.\n\n\u201cWe got a chance to play a lot of people,\u201d said Mincey, whose squad improved to 3-2 in 2-AA. The Lady Redskins played at Screven County on Tuesday and will take on Jenkins on Tuesday in the Portal Holiday Classic.\n\nThe Redskins (6-3 overall, 5-1 3-AA), fell 55-42 to Claxton on Saturday after downing Bacon County 63-50 on Friday night.
