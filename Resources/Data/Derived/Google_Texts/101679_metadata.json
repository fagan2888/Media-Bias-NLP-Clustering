beds in the future.\n\nOklahomans under the age of 18 may be banned from using tanning beds in the future.\n\nState lawmakers are considering two bills that would restrict the indoor tanning age.\n\nThe American Cancer Society is pushing for the change and enlisted a familiar face to personalize their effort.\n\n\u201cIt was self-inflicted, what I did to myself,\u201d said Caryn Ross as she addressed the crowd.\n\nRoss is more comfortable behind a stovetop than a podium, endearing viewers with her weekly cooking segments as Sassy Mama.\n\nNow, she has captivated a different audience, sharing her story with cancer patients, survivors and advocates at the American Cancer Society\u2019s Cancer Action Network Day at the Oklahoma state Capitol.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Caryn, I\u2019m sorry, you have melanoma, you have skin cancer,\u2019\u201d Ross recalled of her September 2015 diagnosis.\n\nRoss and the rest of the advocates are supporting House Bill 1471 and Senate Bill 508 which both prohibit anyone 18 and under from using tanning beds in Oklahoma.\n\n\u201cHonestly, for prom, that's what you did,\u201d Ross explained. \u201cYou would just tan and tan and tan, until I was literally darker than the woodwork.\"\n\nRoss started tanning at age 15 and said it was like an addiction.\n\nLast fall, at age 44, a freckle on her back turned out to be melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer.\n\nShe must now see a doctor every four months to make sure the cancer has not returned.\n\nRoss said she will have a life-long relationship with dermatologists, oncologists and surgeons just because she used a tanning bed.\n\n\u201cIt is a level one carcinogen, so if you are going to buy your child a tanning package, offer them a pack of cigarettes as you go in, too, because they are the exact same level,\u201d Ross told News 9.\n\nUniversity of Minnesota researchers recently discovered that women under 50 were two to six times more likely to develop melanoma if they had tanned indoors.\n\nAn Oklahoma City dermatologist, whose daughter is a melanoma survivor, said children seem to think they are bulletproof and that is when adults must step in.\n\n\"We need to act in Oklahoma and we need to act quickly,\u201d said Dr. Raymond Cornelison, past president of the American Academy of Dermatology. \u201cWe are protecting the health of our children and we are charged as adults with doing that.\"\n\nThis year, 570 Oklahomans will be diagnosed with melanoma and 130 will die from it.\n\nOpponents said the bills would take away current freedoms and may hurt small businesses like tanning salons.\n\nHouse Bill 1471 passed out of subcommittee on Tuesday and now heads to the full Appropriations and Budget Committee.\n\nClick here to learn more about the American
