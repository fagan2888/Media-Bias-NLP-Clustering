Mr. Johnson and Ms. Baldwin represent the kind of political diversity that has been relatively uncommon in Congress, a legacy of 19th-century politics when geography largely determined how people cast their votes for statewide office. Today, just 16 states have one Democratic senator and one Republican senator. Vermont has a Democratic senator and an independent, Bernard Sanders, who caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nIn several of those states, the senators often find areas of political agreement, or camaraderie at the very least.\n\nSusan Collins, Republican of Maine, and her colleague Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, have drawn up official letterhead with both of their names stripped across the top. A prolific texter, he sends her so many messages that her once-minimal texting skills now rival a teenager\u2019s.\n\nMark Begich, a Democrat, and Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, regularly share long flights home to Alaska and live a block and a half from each other in Washington. They often chat when Ms. Murkowski is out walking her dog in the neighborhood.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Johnson and Ms. Baldwin have very little relationship inside or outside of the Senate. Neither could recall the last time they spoke at length.\n\nPhoto\n\nDinner together, perhaps? \u201cHaven\u2019t done that, no,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cFirst of all, we don\u2019t have time.\u201d\n\nThere was lunch once in the Senate dining room, which Ms. Baldwin said she brokered with the help of Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, the senior Republican from Wisconsin. They had a businesslike time talking mostly about federal judges, but no one offered to make it a standing appointment.\n\nMr. Johnson won in 2010, a year with no presidential contest when energized conservatives were toppling Democratic candidates all over the country. It was a low-turnout election, with only 2.2 million Wisconsin voters showing up at the polls.\n\nWhen Ms. Baldwin was elected in 2012, President Obama was on the ballot, and three million people cast ballots for senator. The president carried the state, and she easily beat Tommy Thompson, a Republican former governor.\n\n\u201cThis state has always vacillated from one extreme to another,\u201d said Representative Ron Kind, a centrist Democrat from the western part of the state. \u201cYou go back to Bob LaFollette, the father of the modern-day Progressive Era, and then there was Joe McCarthy,\u201d he added, referring to two of the state\u2019s most famous senators.\n\nMr. Kind said he was encouraged that Ms. Baldwin and Mr. Johnson have worked together when Wisconsin is concerned, citing their effort to fill empty seats on the federal bench. \u201cThat seemed to work well,\u201d he said. Besides, rivalries between members of the same party can often be far worse, others pointed out.\n\nThose who have worked with both of them said their differences even extend to their delivery style and demeanor.\n\nPhoto\n\nMr. Johnson travels the state showing a PowerPoint presentation on the country\u2019s financial woes \u2014 not exactly inspirational stuff, he is the first to acknowledge. But it animates him to the point that he can talk himself hoarse and now carries throat lozenges.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not trying to appeal to your heartstrings,\u201d said Robin Vos, the Republican speaker of the State Assembly. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to appeal to your head. And I have to say, sometimes it\u2019s a little depressing.\u201d\n\nMs. Baldwin\u2019s low-key approach is what endears her to supporters. \u201cShe seemed to have an equanimity about her, almost a serenity,\u201d said Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, one of her closest friends in the Senate, who started campaigning for her in the 1990s when she was running for the House.\n\nLast month they had one rare area of agreement on a major piece of legislation that Republicans largely opposed: they both voted yes for the budget bill that will keep the government funded. And in a move that surprised many in his party, Mr. Johnson was highly critical of his Republican colleagues for forcing a government shutdown in October.\n\nIf Ms. Baldwin was at all heartened to hear him speak out against the shutdown, she wasn\u2019t showing it. \u201cI hope it would be an obvious fact that this was not something that was constructive,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd Mr. Johnson emphasized that his budget vote and shutdown critique were not signs that he is going soft.\n\nHe likened his approach to government to taking candy away from someone with a sweet tooth \u2014 if candy were government-subsidized assistance, and the sweet tooths were the American people. \u201cWe are in the unenviable position of saying, \u2018We know you like that candy. And we like it too,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you notice, that candy caused you a cavity. It\u2019s an abscess. It\u2019s infecting the body. In the end it could kill you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140117205213, "twitter": {"description": "Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, and Ron Johnson, a Republican, of Wisconsin personify the polarized Congress, voting against each other more than any other state\u2019s senators.", "title": "Two Senators Have Little but a State in Common", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/us/politics/2-senators-have-little-but-a-state-in-common.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002657307"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "jwpetersNYT", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/18/us/18divide_375/18divide_375-thumbLarge-v3.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/us/politics/2-senators-have-little-but-a-state-in-common.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002657307", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/us/politics/2-senators-have-little-but-a-state-in-common.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "hdl_p": "Wisconsin\u2019s Senators Appear to Have Little but Their State in Common", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 17, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Senate", "keywords": "Johnson  Ron (1955- ),Baldwin  Tammy Suzanne Green,United States Politics and Government,Wisconsin,Senate", "news_keywords": "Wisconsin,Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jeremy W.
