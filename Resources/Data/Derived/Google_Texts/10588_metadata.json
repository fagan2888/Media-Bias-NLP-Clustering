Because insurance companies won\u2019t bear the cost of their own losses\u2014at least not more than about a quarter of them. The other three-quarters will be borne by American taxpayers.\n\nFor some reason, President Obama hasn\u2019t talked about this particular feature of his signature legislation. Indeed, it\u2019s bad enough that Obamacare is projected by the Congressional Budget Office to funnel $1,071,000,000,000.00 (that\u2019s $1.071 trillion) over the next decade (2014 to 2023) from American taxpayers, through Washington, to health insurance companies. It\u2019s even worse that Obamacare is trying to coerce Americans into buying those same insurers\u2019 product (although there are escape routes). It\u2019s almost unbelievable that it will also subsidize those same insurers\u2019 losses.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what it will do\u2014unless Republicans take action. As Laszewski explains, Obamacare contains a \u201cReinsurance Program that caps big claim costs for insurers (individual plans only).\u201d He writes that \u201cin 2014, 80% of individual costs between $45,000 and $250,000 are paid by the government [read: by taxpayers], for example.\u201d\n\nIn other words, insurance purchased through Obamacare\u2019s government-run exchanges isn\u2019t even full-fledged private insurance; rather, it\u2019s a sort of private-public hybrid. Private insurance companies pay for costs below $45,000, then taxpayers generously pick up the tab\u2014a tab that their president hasn\u2019t ever bothered to tell them he has opened up on their behalf\u2014for four-fifths of the next $200,000-plus worth of costs. In this way, and so many others, Obamacare takes a major step toward the government monopoly over American medicine (\u201csingle payer\u201d) that liberals drool about in their sleep.\n\nLaszewski adds, \u201cThe reinsurance program has done and will continue to do what it was intended to do; help attract and keep more carriers in Obamacare than might have otherwise come.\u201d Thus, Obamacare is being aided by having taxpayers subsidize big insurance companies\u2019 business expenses. (Who could ever have guessed that big government and big business might be natural allies?)\n\nBut, amazingly, it doesn\u2019t stop there. Laszewski writes that Obamacare also contains a \u201cRisk Corridor Program that limits overall losses for insurers.\u201d So insurers not only don\u2019t have to pay out all of their costs; they also don\u2019t have to swallow all of their losses.\n\nLaszewski explains that if an insurance company expects its costs in a given year to be X, and those costs end up being more than X plus 2 percent, taxpayers will come to that insurance company\u2019s rescue\u2014thanks to Obamacare. In fact, once an insurance company covers that initial 2 percent in unexpected costs, taxpayers will cover at least 80 percent of any additional costs the insurer accrues.\n\nLaszewski provides a couple of examples to help illustrate taxpayers\u2019 unwitting generosity toward these \u201cparticipating health plans\u201d (plans sold through Obamacare\u2019s government-run exchanges):\n\n\u201c[I]f the health plan has costs at 110% of the medical cost target [the costs that the insurer expects to accrue], it will be responsible for only 102.4% of the target (a 2.4% shortfall)\u2014only about a quarter of its losses.\n\n\u201cIf the health plan\u2019s medical costs come in at 120% of the expected claim cost target level, the health plan will only be responsible for 104.4% of the target (a 4.4% shortfall)\u2014again only about a quarter of its losses.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s actually only about a fifth in this example, as taxpayers would cover 78 percent of the losses, with the insurer covering just 22 percent.\n\nImportantly, Laszewski (who\u2019s in a position to know) says that \u201cmy sense is that health plans, because they are so insulated from big losses, will generally stand pat with their 2014 rate structures for 2015\u2014no matter how bad the early claims experience looks. I expect that the health insurance industry will be content to give the Obama administration one more chance to reboot Obamacare in the fall of 2014, when the 2015 open enrollment takes place.\u201d\n\nIn other words, because taxpayers will bail them out (through both the \u201cReinsurance Program\u201d and the \u201cRisk Corridor Program\u201d), insurers won\u2019t raise their premiums as much for 2015 as they otherwise would in response to the sicker, older risk pools that Obamacare is clearly attracting. This in turn will make Obamacare look better going forward than it should and will give its government-run exchanges another good swing at the \u201cyoung invincibles,\u201d who so far don\u2019t seem too enamored with the product that Obama and his insurance cronies are hawking.\n\nAll of this puts two things in sharp relief: First, Republicans should attach a no-bailout provision to any debt-ceiling increase\u2014as Charles Krauthammer has suggested\u2014along with a provision delaying Obamacare\u2019s liberty-sapping individual mandate (the delay of which would further undermine Obamacare\u2019s exchanges). Second, Obamacare needs to be comprehensively repealed in January 2017, not modified or \u201cfixed\u201d\u2014and Republicans need to advance a winning alternative to pave the way to that crucial result.\n\nUPDATE: Senator Marco Rubio introduced a bill in November to stop the part of the bailout that would take place through the Risk Corridor Program.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bailout,Federal,Government,Health Care,insurance,Jeffrey H.
