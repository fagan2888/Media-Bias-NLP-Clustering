Planned Parenthood. The event criticized taxpayer funding of abortion through ObamaCare, as brought to light in a new GAO report.\n\nThe prospect of having to participate in plans that cover abortion (there are five states in which all ObamaCare plans cover abortion) had pro-life leaders talking about civil disobedience.\n\nAt the conference, Live Action President Lila Rose explained \u201cgovernment subsidies are going to Planned Parenthood currently, and that under Obamacare, 1,000 healthcare plans are now covering abortion.\u201d The pro-life movement should refuse \u201cblood money\u201d \u201cno matter the cost\u201d \u2013 even, as Ryan Bomberger of The Radiance Foundation suggested, to the point of civil disobedience and prison.\n\nIn an interview with the Media Research Center, Lila Rose said the pro-life movement should respond with civil disobedience, to the extent of even facing prison. \u201cI think that, if it comes to us having to not purchase plans that include abortion, absolutely. We can\u2019t violate our consciences,\u201d Rose argued, \u201cThat\u2019s something that we have to refuse to do in the end, no matter the cost.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re being forced to violate our consciences or else pay fines or suffer other penalties,\u201d Rose stressed, \u201cbut we can\u2019t do that.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t purchase abortions,\u201d she repeated. \u201cWe can\u2019t purchase the killing of children. It\u2019s blood money, and it\u2019s committing a human rights abuse.\u201d\n\nResponding to the same question, Ryan Bomberger (himself conceived in rape) said, \u201cI think we have to be willing\u201d to pay fines or face prison.\n\n\u201cCivil disobedience is a powerful thing,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe can see it throughout American history. Look at the civil rights era. Look at the incredible results that came from that non-violent form of protest.\u201d\n\nFor the pro-life movement, Bomberger wished the same outcomes:\n\n\u201cI hope that not just pro-lifers today, but those that become pro-life tomorrow and the next month are passionate enough to say, \u2018You know what? This may mean prison. This may mean I get fired from my job.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe continued:\n\n\u201cI just hope that pro-lifers get to a point where they don\u2019t care about being uncomfortable. What they care about is that this is the social injustice of our day. And so, it\u2019s worth being fired, it\u2019s worth losing friends, it\u2019s worth even losing family members and relationships there, because this is a human rights issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hated all the time,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthat\u2019s a given.\u201d But, \u201cin the end, we\u2019re speaking truth. And I truly believe that we\u2019re transforming hearts and minds one soul at a time.\u201d\n\nClick here to sign up for daily pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\nConcerned Women for America Communications Director Alison Howard argued, \u201cWhen you\u2019re asking people of faith to go against their deeply held religious convictions, that\u2019s not balance, that\u2019s tyranny.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Howard asserted, \u201cYou\u2019re going to see pastors rise up and say, \u2018I\u2019m not okay with it, and I\u2019m not going to let my congregation continue to partake, with their funds, and their energy, to be sold out and lied to by organizations like Planned Parenthood.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut Howard expressed hope for the future. \u201cForty years ago, they said that the debate on abortion would be done in Roe v. Wade,\u201d she began. \u201cNow, forty years later, we have stories, history and science behind us to explain what so many thought they knew and were willing to uphold then: that life in utero is precious. \u201c\n\nIn regards to the media coverage of federal funding for abortion, Howard emphasized how \u201cthe media has dropped the ball.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we found out that money was going towards hurting animals, money was going towards funding some pet projects,\u201d she explained, \u201cthat would have been front-page news.\u201d\n\nHoward urged, \u201cWe have to continue to do better, continue to use other platforms \u2013 social media being one of them \u2013 to encourage, inform and educate young people and America on what\u2019s really going on.\u201d\n\nBesides Rose, Bomberger and Howard, the event boasted speakers including pro-life activist Jill Stanek, Joshua Duggar of The Family Research Council and Missy Martinez of Students for Life of America.\n\nLifeNews Note: Katie Yoder writes for Newsbusters, where this originally appeared.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pro-Life Leaders Urge Civil Disobedience: We'll Go to Jail Before Buying Abortion-Funding Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Here\u2019s something the\u00a0pro-abortion media\u00a0won\u2019t want to hear: the risks the pro-life movement will take to defend the defenseless and\u00a0speak for the voicele", "title": "Pro-Life Leaders Urge Civil Disobedience: We\u2019ll Go to Jail Before Buying Abortion-Funding Obamacare", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/10/15/pro-life-leaders-urge-civil-disobedience-well-go-to-jail-before-buying-abortion-funding-obamacare/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/plannedparenthood133c-190x142.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "pro-life leaders urge civil disobedience: we\\'ll go to jail before buying abortion-funding obamacare", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The prospect of having to participate in plans that cover abortion (there are five states in which all ObamaCare plans cover abortion) had pro-life leaders talking about civil disobedience.\nIn an interview with the Media Research Center, Lila Rose said the pro-life movement should respond with civil disobedience, to the extent of even facing prison.\nHere\u2019s something the pro-abortion media won\u2019t want to hear: the risks the pro-life movement will take to defend the defenseless and speak for the voiceless.\nThe event criticized taxpayer funding of abortion through ObamaCare, as brought to light in a new GAO report.\nOn Tuesday, Oct. 14, pro-life advocacy group Live Action hosted a news conference in front of the Washington, D.C."}
