Carolyn B. Maloney (D), Jerrold Nadler (D) and Peter King (R) warned in a press release Monday.\n\n\u201cClaim determinations could be cut by half or more, unless Congress extends and fully funds the program,\u201d added the lawmakers, who introduced a bill a few months ago that authorizes the funding and extends it permanently.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEarlier this month, Maloney said a quarter of the House had already backed the legislation.\n\nTheir call for a reauthorization comes the same day as the fund released a new report outlining how many people have filed claims, are waiting on claims and have received compensation so far.\n\nFirst responders account for 91 percent of the awards given so far, and people with cancer make up 18 percent of the awards.\n\nMore than 19,000 people have submitted compensation eligibility forms to the fund, but only about 13,000 could be decided for now. Of that group, about more than 11,700 were eligible for compensation, but about half of them haven\u2019t received it.\n\nThe lawmakers\u2019 bill would prevent a shutdown of the compensation fund in October 2016.\n\nTo be eligible for the program, a person must have evidence that the claimant was present at the World Trade Center, Pentagon or Shanksville, Pa., during or after the attacks in 2001.\n\nThe person must also have evidence that the claimant died of, or suffered from, an illness or injury directly related to the attacks and have a signed authorization allowing the fund to collect information to process the claim.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The compensation fund is set to expire in October 2016.", "description": "The compensation fund is set to expire in October 2016.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Rebecca Shabad", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The compensation fund is set to expire in October 2016.", "title": "NY lawmakers: 9/11 victims could lose financial support", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/248557-ny-lawmakers-9-11-compensation-fund-will-run-out-without-reauthorization", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/kingpeter_021512gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/248557-ny-lawmakers-9-11-compensation-fund-will-run-out-without-reauthorization", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-20T17:32-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Rebecca Shabad", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-20T17:32:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/248557-ny-lawmakers-9-11-compensation-fund-will-run-out-without-reauthorization", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The compensation fund is set to expire in October 2016.", "card": "summary", "title": "NY lawmakers: 9/11 victims could lose financial support"}, "dcterms.title": "NY lawmakers: 9/11 victims could lose financial support"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfe3d\"", "article_summary": "Three New York lawmakers are warning that victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks could lose financial support in October 2016 if Congress doesn\u2019t reauthorize the compensation fund.\nThe September 11th Victim Compensation Fund is slated to expire then, and only a quarter of compensation claims have been resolved so far.\nThe lawmakers\u2019 bill would prevent a shutdown of the compensation fund in October 2016.\nMore than 19,000 people have submitted compensation eligibility forms to the fund, but only about 13,000 could be decided for now.\nOf that group, about more than 11,700 were eligible for compensation, but about half of them haven\u2019t received it."}
