Associated Press\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa\u2014John Kasich isn\u2019t a partisan warrior\u2014or at least that\u2019s the strategy his campaign is going for.\n\nWhile other Republican candidates were touting their conservative principles in speeches at the Iowa State Fair this week, Mr. Kasich, the governor of Ohio, took a different tack. As he took the stage Tuesday afternoon, he sought to distance himself from the Republican Party, characterizing himself as an \u201cindependent person\u201d and bragging about his experience working with the Clinton administration in the late 1990s.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Republican,\u201d he told a crowd of fairgoers. \u201cBut the party has always been my vehicle, and never my master.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to his bipartisan roots\u2014\u201cMy father was a Democrat all his life\u201d\u2014and highlighted support he won in Ohio from traditionally liberal voters. \u201cI got 26% of the African-American vote, 51% of union households, 60% of women,\u201d he said of his re-election in 2014. Unlike his rivals, his speech was largely devoid of criticism of President Barack Obama.\n\nIn a crowded field of Republicans that includes many often-controversial voices, like that of frontrunner Donald Trump, Mr. Kasich is looking to cast himself as a voice of reason and empathy within the Republican Party. His desire to be a different kind of candidate than Mr. Trump, who is tapping into Americans\u2019 anger and frustration, was evident on Tuesday. There\u2019s \u201ctoo much anger in America today, too much division,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s also in his interest to be seen as a candidate who can win the votes of minorities and women, particularly as Mr. Trump continues to run into trouble with both groups. Pollsters say the Republican Party needs to greatly expand its share of the non-white vote in 2016 to win the White House.\n\nThe observation that Mr. Kasich appears more moderate than many of his GOP rivals is not a rare one. In an interview with the governor aired on Sunday, CNN\u2019s Dana Bash put it bluntly. \u201cYou sound like a Democrat sometimes,\u201d she told him.\n\n\u201cI think Republicans allowed themselves to be put in a box,\u201d Mr. Kasich responded. \u201cTo me, conservatism is giving everybody a chance to be able to successful. That\u2019s the way Reagan was. I mean, that\u2019s common sense.\u201d\n\nThe extent of Mr. Kasich\u2019s moderate beliefs is reflected in his record in Ohio, where he in many instances diverged from conservative orthodoxy. He bypassed the Republican-controlled legislature to expand Medicaid to provide health care to low-income adults. He also has backed the Common Core educational standards that many Republicans have criticized.\n\nAfter supporting as a member of Congress an end to birthright citizenship\u2014a subject that has gained traction in the GOP field in recent days following Mr. Trump\u2019s pledge to repeal it as president\u2014Mr. Kasich reversed his stance on the issue in a recent CNN interview. \u201cI think we need to get over that. I\u2019m not for it anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cLet these people who are born here be citizens and that\u2019s the end of it. I don\u2019t want to dwell on it.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, Mr. Kasich has also avowed several conservative policies. Like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Mr. Kasich supported restricting the power of public-employee unions in Ohio, though he stood down after voters overturned his anti-collective-bargaining law.\n\nMr. Kasich earlier this year proposed reducing taxes in Ohio by $500 million, after reducing taxes by $3 billion during his first term. He also says he would repeal the Affordable Care Act, and he has appeared skeptical about climate change, calling it \u201csome theory that\u2019s not proven\u201d in a recent interview with NBC.\n\nOhio Senate Minority Leader Joe Schiavioni penned an op-ed in USA Today on Tuesday criticizing the perception of Mr. Kasich as a moderate. \u201cI can tell you my job would be a whole lot easier if John Kasich were actually a moderate,\u201d he wrote.\n\nVideo\n\nJerry Seib: What John Kasich Brings to the 2016 Race", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "John Kasich isn't a partisan warrior\u2014or at least that\u2019s the strategy his campaign is going for.", "title": "John Kasich Sees Middle Lane as Route to Victory", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/08/19/john-kasich-sees-middle-lane-as-route-to-victory/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JX408_Kasich_P_20150818232320.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "John Kasich Sees Middle Lane as Route to Victory", "description": "John Kasich isn't a partisan warrior\u2014or at least that\u2019s the strategy his campaign is going for.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Rebecca Ballhaus", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "John Kasich isn't a partisan warrior\u2014or at least that\u2019s the strategy his campaign is going for.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-08-19T10:48:39-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/08/19/john-kasich-sees-middle-lane-as-route-to-victory/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-57392", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "John Kasich isn't a partisan warrior\u2014or at least that\u2019s the strategy his campaign is going for.", "title": "John Kasich Sees Middle Lane as Route to Victory", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/08/19/john-kasich-sees-middle-lane-as-route-to-victory/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-JX408_Kasich_P_20150818232320.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-57392", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-08-19T18:09:20-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfecd\"", "article_summary": "I don\u2019t want to dwell on it.\u201dTo be sure, Mr. Kasich has also avowed several conservative policies.\nThe observation that Mr. Kasich appears more moderate than many of his GOP rivals is not a rare one.\nPollsters say the Republican Party needs to greatly expand its share of the non-white vote in 2016 to win the White House.\nHis desire to be a different kind of candidate than Mr. Trump, who is tapping into Americans\u2019 anger and frustration, was evident on Tuesday.\nOhio Senate Minority Leader Joe Schiavioni penned an op-ed in USA Today on Tuesday criticizing the perception of Mr. Kasich as a moderate."}
