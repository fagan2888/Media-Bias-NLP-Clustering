Cory Booker (D-NJ) expressed his support for a Democratic-backed bill being pushed in the U.S. Senate designed to override the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the Hobby Lobby case and impel for-profit employers to cover the full range of contraception for their employees, a health-care provision required by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBooker, who is co-sponsoring the proposed bill, which he called the \u201cNot My Boss\u2019s Business Act,\u201d spoke out in response to the high court\u2019s June 30 5-4 decision, which ruled that many private companies, including plaintiff Hobby Lobby craft stores, were allowed to seek an exemption from the contraception mandate if they could name a religious objection to providing health plans that include some forms of birth control.\n\n\u201cThis week I know the Senate will be voting on legislation that is a response to this decision,\u201d said Booker on Monday in remarks made at Planned Parenthood NJ headquarters in Montclair. \u201cThe reason is very simple, plain and obvious \u2013 access to contraception is essential to a woman\u2019s right to make responsible and personal decisions about their health. The reason that we are here is that simple ideal that a woman should have the right to make their own contraception decisions. It is not their bosses\u2019 business, it is their business. A woman\u2019s health care decisions should be between a woman and their doctor, and there\u2019s no room in that equation whatsoever for the employer, or the boss.\n\n\u201cBirth control is basic health care for women. Ninety-nine percent of women will use birth control in their lifetimes,\u201d Booker added. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a partisan issue. This isn\u2019t a red state or blue state issue. This is an issue that affects all women, and giving them the freedom to make their own contraception decisions\u2026It\u2019s unbelievable to me that now, this day in 2014, we are still fighting about whether women should have access to birth control.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyopolitickernj.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/corybookerjuly142014.jpg?w=50", "description": "MONTCLAIR - U.S. Sen.
