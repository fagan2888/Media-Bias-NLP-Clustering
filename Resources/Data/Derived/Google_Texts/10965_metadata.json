Randolph Hospital was one of four recipients \u2014 and the only hospital \u2014 in North Carolina.\n\nThe grant will be used to hire two full-time navigators and an administrative assistant to join Jo Ellen Needham, supervisor of the hospital\u2019s navigator program, which is housed in an office on Foust Street in Asheboro.\n\nNavigators will spread the word in the community, too, meeting people wherever they are \u2014 at churches, through civic groups and via organizations such as Christians United Outreach Center.\n\nIn years past, the program has covered Randolph, Montgomery and Moore counties. It will be expanded to include Chatham County. One navigator will focus on the Latino/Hispanic community.\n\nWhat is it?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited about this,\u201d said Devin Griffith, the hospital\u2019s vice president of care continuum and support services. \u201cIt\u2019s going to have a significant impact.\u201d\n\nThe navigator program is designed to help consumers understand new coverage options and find the most affordable coverage that meets their health care needs.\n\n\u201cIt does take a lot of time and personal attention to help our community and citizens understand the options that are available under the health insurance exchange,\u201d Griffith said.\n\nConsumers do not have to speak with a navigator to purchase insurance on the exchange. They can sign up online.\n\n\u201cI think, for many individuals, they could benefit from some guidance \u2014 and some unbiased guidance \u2014 as to what their options are,\u201d Griffith said.\n\nCurrently, three insurers offer 30 plans in the state marketplace; that number is likely to change, along with the plans themselves, and premiums, for 2016.\n\nWhy is it important?\n\nThe open enrollment period begins Nov. 1 and ends on Jan. 31, 2016, although individuals who experience certain life-changing events, such as losing a job, may sign up anytime. Those already enrolled need re-enroll to continue coverage.\n\nPenalties for not having insurance have gone up each year since ACA implementation. In 2016, the penalty will increase to $695 per uninsured adult in a household (and half of that for each uninsured child) \u2014 or 2.5 percent of family income \u2014 whichever is greater.\n\nEducation and enrollment are simply the first steps in a process, Griffith said. Navigators help those who need help find a primary care physician. Individuals with a primary care home usually take better advantage of healthcare screenings, and, if they are on medications, a doctor can help them manage their drugs.\n\n\u201cOverall, they will have better healthcare outcomes,\u201d Griffith said.\n\nAnyone who does not have healthcare insurance through an employer is eligible for ACA marketplace plans, but eligibility for subsidies \u2014 to make the coverage affordable \u2014 is based on household income. Some do not make enough money to qualify for the subsidies.\n\nNearly 14,000 individuals in Randolph (just over 8,000), Montgomery (about 1,080) and Moore (just under 4,800) counties are receiving some type of health insurance coverage via the North Carolina marketplace; more than 2,750 Asheboro residents are enrolled.\n\nAbout 93 percent of those enrolled receive a subsidy.\n\nA central goal of the Affordable Care is to significantly reduce the number of uninsured by providing affordable options through health insurance marketplaces and Medicaid.\n\nThe ACA cut Medicare reimbursements to hospitals, and that money was intended to help fund Medicaid expansion. North Carolina is one of 20 states that have not expanded Medicaid; state lawmakers say the program needs to be reformed before there is talk of expanding it.\n\nExpansion would have created a new Medicaid category for adults, ages 22-64.\n\n\u201cWe estimate that there are 9,000 people in our county that are not eligible for the subsidies,\u201d Griffith said, \u201cand those people will stay uninsured.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nFor information about Randolph Hospital\u2019s navigator program, call (336) 633-7800.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ASHEBORO \u2014 Randolph Hospital has received a three-year federal grant of $795,108 for its insurance navigator program.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Chip Womick cwomick@courier-tribune.com Twitter: @ChipWomickCT", "og": {"url": "http://courier-tribune.com/news/local/795k-grant-boosts-hospital-s-navigator-program", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Courier-Tribune", "description": "ASHEBORO \u2014 Randolph Hospital has received a three-year federal grant of $795,108 for its insurance navigator program.", "title": "$795K grant boosts hospital\u2019s \u2018navigator\u2019 program"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://courier-tribune.com/news/local/795k-grant-boosts-hospital-s-navigator-program", "creator": "@Courier_Tribune", "card": "summary", "title": "$795K grant boosts hospital\u2019s \u2018navigator\u2019 program"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "courier-tribune://?eid=454839", "app_name": "courier-tribune", "package": "com.stephensmedia.couriertribune"}, "ios": {"url": "courier-tribune://?eid=454839", "app_store_id": 964469617, "app_name": "courier-tribune"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964469617", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.couriertribune", "keywords": "Local,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-04T17:47:40-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "ASHEBORO \u2014 Randolph Hospital has received a three-year federal grant of $795,108 for its insurance navigator program.\nThe grant will be used to hire two full-time navigators and an administrative assistant to join Jo Ellen Needham, supervisor of the hospital\u2019s navigator program, which is housed in an office on Foust Street in Asheboro.\nThe specially trained navigators help uninsured consumers sign up for marketplace insurance under the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to have a significant impact.\u201dThe navigator program is designed to help consumers understand new coverage options and find the most affordable coverage that meets their health care needs.\n\u201cWe estimate that there are 9,000 people in our county that are not eligible for the subsidies,\u201d Griffith said, \u201cand those people will stay uninsured.\u201d* * *For information about Randolph Hospital\u2019s navigator program, call (336) 633-7800."}
