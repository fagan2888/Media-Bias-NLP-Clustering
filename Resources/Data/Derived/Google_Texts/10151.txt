A Chatham man was pronounced dead at the scene of a multi-vehicle crash involving a tractor-trailer that shut down Route 78 in both directions in Union county Saturday afternoon, State Police spokesman Sgt. Gregory Williams said.

Driving an Audi A4 onto 78 west from the Garden State Parkway ramp, James Pinaire, 24, lost control of the vehicle and traveled into the path of a tanker-trailer driven by Balwinder Singh, 35, of Valley Stream, New York, Williams said.

Both vehicles then crashed with a tractor-trailer hauling mulch driven by Mario Quiroz, 53, of North Bergen in the left express lane. After the collision, the tractor-trailer came to rest on the concrete barrier. The tractor trailer, driven by Singh, caught on fire, sending a plume of smoke that was visible for miles.

Singh managed to escape the burning tractor-trailer. He and Quiroz were taken to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick. On Sunday, Singh was listed in critical condition, Williams said.

The local and express lanes on Route 78 closed at about 1 p.m. between Exit 51 for Burnett Avenue in Union and Exit 54 for Winans Avenue/Paine Avenue in Irvington, according to the state Department of Transportation. Williams said all local lanes and one express lane reopened at 2:30 a.m.

The investigation remains active, Williams said.
