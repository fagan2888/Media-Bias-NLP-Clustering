(Photo: Thinkstock)\n\nThe nature of work has been changing \u2014 partly as a result of a sluggish economic recovery but also because of evolving expectations for employment, especially among younger adults. Millions of Americans no longer labor in 9-to-5 jobs for a single employer. Many are independent contractors or freelancers, some work for temporary staffing agencies and others hold one or more part-time jobs.\n\nWhatever the case, people who don't have a full-time, permanent position with a single employer face somewhat different financial-planning considerations compared with those who do. Health insurance, retirement plans, taxes, budgeting and saving are some of the key topics. Independent workers might need to take greater responsibility for these areas.\n\nHealth insurance is the obvious example. The Affordable Care Act has extended subsidized coverage to millions of people who don't get it through the workplace. Instead, people can buy it through government-supervised marketplaces or exchanges.\n\nThe act might even contribute to the rise of independent workers by weakening the link between affordable health insurance and employment. Many small companies, especially those with under 50 full-time workers, might attempt to keep their head counts down (firms with more than 50 workers face penalties if they don't provide coverage). Many workers might be tempted to work for themselves now that their insurance is portable and not dependent on a specific job.\n\nLife insurance is another type of coverage for which independent workers should be thinking. The same holds for disability insurance, which would be nice to have if you suffer an injury or face a medical condition that makes it difficult to work.\n\nDisability is a type of coverage that's easy to overlook when there's no human-resources department to remind you. \"So many self-employed people don't have disability insurance,\" said Catherine Scrivano, a financial planner at Casco Financial Group in Phoenix.\n\nThe Council for Disability Awareness offers a quick online calculator (whatsmypdq.org) that can help assess the likelihood you might face a disability absence.\n\nAnother key difference for independent workers involves retirement planning. Employees in permanent jobs often have access to a 401(k)-style plan and, possibly, a traditional pension. Independent workers might not enjoy these benefits, especially pensions. Rather, they can build their own plans using Individual Retirement Accounts, SEP-IRAs, individual 401(k) plans and other programs designed for freelancers, sole proprietors and others.\n\nFor example, workers who don't participate in an employer-sponsored retirement plan can set up a traditional IRA, without facing income-eligibility limits. IRAs, SEP-IRAs and other programs usually are flexible in terms of contributions, meaning you can reduce the amounts you invest in lean years.\n\nRegardless of the account, independent workers often need to take more responsibility. Permanent workers with access to employer 401(k) plans must pick their own mutual funds or other investments, but typically it's from a fairly narrow menu of perhaps a dozen pre-selected choices. Independent workers, by contrast, face a virtually limitless range of possibilities, and all those choices can be daunting. Independent workers need to decide where to set up their accounts and how much to save from each paycheck.\n\nThough some independent jobs pay quite well, the lack of a permanent employer means people working on their own should have a cash cushion in place to guard against slow periods and other risks. Ronjon Bhattacharya, who owns a staffing firm in Phoenix, said he likes to keep a $50,000 buffer \"just in case I lose all my clients.\"\n\nEmergency reserves are smart anyway, to pay for unanticipated costs such as major auto repairs. Even people with permanent jobs often neglect this. A majority of 1,000 respondents surveyed by Bankrate.com in December said they lack the liquid savings to meet a surprise $1,000 payment.\n\nScrivano suggests building up emergency reserves capable of meeting at least six months of anticipated expenses.\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share RETIRE IN STYLE How to save as you near retirement | 2:45 USA TODAY\u2019s retirement columnist Rodney Brooks talks to Jeanne Thompson, a vice president at Fidelity about saving aggressively for retirement.
