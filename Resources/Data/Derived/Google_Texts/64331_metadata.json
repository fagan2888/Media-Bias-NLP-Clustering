Photo: Kaiser Family Foundation\n\nDrew Altman is president and chief executive officer of the Kaiser Family Foundation. He is on Twitter: @drewaltman.\n\nThe decision by House Speaker Paul Ryan to bow out of any attempt to draft him as the Republican presidential nominee in Cleveland and press ahead with his domestic policy agenda could be significant for health care. The next big debate might not be about Republican proposals to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. It might focus more on the future of the two largest public health-care programs, Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nAs the chart above shows, Medicare covered 55 million and Medicaid covered 66 million people in 2015 at a cost of more than $1 trillion. Together, they represented 23% of the federal budget.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that Mr. Ryan and Republicans working on these issues in the House will put forward variations on ideas they have previously advanced, such as transforming Medicaid into block grants to the states, with capped federal funding, and converting Medicare into some form of a premium support program. Having seen these ideas crash and burn in the past, Republicans may put forward more politically palatable proposals\u2013though Democrats and liberals are still sure to oppose them fiercely. The impact on beneficiaries and states will depend on details of the proposals. It\u2019s likely that, honoring political promises, these proposals will be coupled to some form of plan to repeal and at least partially replace the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA legislative agenda dealing with all of U.S. health care\u2019s major programs is not likely to diminish attention to any of its parts. Each program has strong constituencies and proposed changes will ignite partisan battle; Medicare is likely to be at the core of the hottest debate, even more fierce than that over the ACA. Any attempt to restructure Medicare\u2013even one phased in so as to affect only future generations\u2013could mobilize seniors with whom the GOP has generally been doing better in recent election cycles.\n\nMedicaid is not necessarily much easier to change. While not popular with conservatives, the program serves some 70 million Americans who are mostly pleased with their coverage, according to surveys and focus groups of beneficiaries. When it comes to cuts, the program is not as popular with the public as Social Security and Medicare are, but it is still very popular. To some degree many changes long sought by conservatives are already happening incrementally: More than half of Medicaid beneficiaries are in private managed-care plans. Almost one-third of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in private Medicare Advantage Plans this year, rather than the traditional program, and the share is projected to grow to more than 40% by 2026. The same is true of private health insurance. Conservatives complain about the ACA, but their preferred vision of health insurance\u2013with high deductibles and lots of \u201cskin in the game\u201d plans\u2013is dominating in the marketplace. The trend is reinforced by many of the policies being sold in the ACA\u2019s insurance marketplaces.\n\nAs House speaker, Paul Ryan will determine whether the next iteration of our national health debate is as much about Medicare and Medicaid as the ACA\u2013or more so. Mr. Ryan\u2019s announcement this week may ultimately leave a Republican health policy agenda laid out as a guidepost for the party regardless of who is elected in November and who future GOP candidates may be.\n\nALSO IN THINK TANK:\n\nFour Reasons Paul Ryan Is Smart to Take Himself Out of the 2016 Running\n\nWhat a Smaller Republican House Majority Could Mean for Paul Ryan", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Drew Altman: As House speaker, Paul Ryan will determine whether the next iteration of our national health debate is as much about Medicare and Medicaid as the ACA--or more so.", "title": "What Paul Ryan\u2019s Stance on 2016 Means for Health Care", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/04/13/what-paul-ryans-stance-on-2016-means-for-health-care/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NN790_PaulRy_P_20160413170928.jpg"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "What Paul Ryan\u2019s Stance on 2016 Means for Health Care", "description": "Drew Altman: As House speaker, Paul Ryan will determine whether the next iteration of our national health debate is as much about Medicare and Medicaid as the ACA--or more so.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Drew Altman", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Drew Altman: As House speaker, Paul Ryan will determine whether the next iteration of our national health debate is as much about Medicare and Medicaid as the ACA--or more so.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2016-04-13T21:12:31-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/04/13/what-paul-ryans-stance-on-2016-means-for-health-care/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-62624", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Drew Altman: As House speaker, Paul Ryan will determine whether the next iteration of our national health debate is as much about Medicare and Medicaid as the ACA--or more so.", "title": "What Paul Ryan\u2019s Stance on 2016 Means for Health Care", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/04/13/what-paul-ryans-stance-on-2016-means-for-health-care/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-NN790_PaulRy_P_20160413170928.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-62624", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2016-04-15T18:07:38-04:00"}, "article_summary": "ALSO IN THINK TANK:Four Reasons Paul Ryan Is Smart to Take Himself Out of the 2016 RunningWhat a Smaller Republican House Majority Could Mean for Paul Ryan\nENLARGE Kaiser Family Foundation chart of the number of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, annual spending, and beneficiaries' median annual income.\nTo some degree many changes long sought by conservatives are already happening incrementally: More than half of Medicaid beneficiaries are in private managed-care plans.\nMr. Ryan\u2019s announcement this week may ultimately leave a Republican health policy agenda laid out as a guidepost for the party regardless of who is elected in November and who future GOP candidates may be.\nAs House speaker, Paul Ryan will determine whether the next iteration of our national health debate is as much about Medicare and Medicaid as the ACA\u2013or more so."}
