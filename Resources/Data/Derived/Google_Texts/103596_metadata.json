Could someone please send the crew at RedState a link for one, stat? Clearly these people don\u2019t understand some simple phrases like \u201cgood deed\u201d for example.\n\nWhile we\u2019re at it, a course in logic is also in dire need for RedState. Regular logic that is. They have the convoluted kind mastered.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAfter Erick Erickson, the man in charge at RedState disinvited Donald Trump from an event this past weekend, Bristol Palin called him out for it. Why? Major hypocrisy. Erickson bumped Trump after comments The Donald made about Fox News debate moderator Megyn Kelly were deemed by Erickson to be sexist. Palin\u2019s mother often talks of glass ceilings, but in this case, and rightfully so, the Palin women pointed to glass houses.\n\nBristol Palin in her blog pointed to several misogynistic follies from RedState. On top of that list, the time when Erickson allowed a fake cleavage-showing picture of Governor Palin on Santa\u2019s lap to run as authentic.\n\nRedState\u2019s reaction to the fact check? Go after a pregnant woman! Seriously? So, Mr. Trump\u2019s comments about Kelly, a news professional whom many thought asked Trump inappropriate questions, were out of line, but attacking a young mother is completely cool? In the Bizzaro World that is RedState\u2013apparently so.\n\nAfter Palin called out Erickson with several examples of creepy comments and questionable judgement, RedState\u2019s Leon H. Wolf, a longtime Palin basher, took the time to post \u201cBristol Palin Allows No Good Deed to Go Unpunished,\u201d a lengthy dose of written diarrhea singing the praises of Erickson and RedState. He attempted to explain away the posting of the photoshopped image of Governor Palin with Kris Kringle. The attempt was about as believable as the old \u201cthe dog ate my homework\u201d excuse.\n\nPalin responded to the men through another blog entry. \u201cThe picture of my mom sitting on Santa\u2019s lap, with her apparently perky boobs hanging out, is CLEARLY photo shopped,\u201d Palin wrote. \u201cAnyone can point that out from a mile away.\u201d Still, Erickson played the clueless card. Cher and Dionne have nothing on big Erick.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t act dumb and put your hands up in the air now, Mr. Erickson,\u201d Palin penned. \u201cI called you out for the hypocrisy you have shown Mr. Trump, by suddenly acting like you are the standard bearer of decency toward women.\u201d\n\nNow back to this perceived \u201cgood deed.\u201d Wolf linked to an old piece in which RedState slammed David Letterman for making a \u201cjoke\u201d about the rape of an underage Palin child. That\u2019s your comparison?\n\nTo summarize, some at RedState feel that since RedState took the \u201cbrave\u201d stance against child rape jokes, all Palins should look the other way when people like Trump are treated unfairly. Real trailblazers over there at RedState. Next thing you know they\u2019ll condemn Jerry Sandusky and cannibalism. These guys are almost as courageous as Bruce Jenner.\n\nWith another child on the way, Bristol Palin is a young woman who has her hands full. Yet, she was able to eloquently and succinctly bust apart the nonsensical actions of some \u201chaters,\u201d as Palin puts it, who clearly needed some schooling.\n\nNo, not many people use a dictionary anymore. But if they ever make a comeback, I could think of a couple of pasty white guys that would certainly be great for the pictures next to the definition of \u2018bullies.\u2019 Whether you Photoshop the pics or pretend to not know that you did is really up to you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After Erick Erickson, the man in charge at RedState disinvited Donald Trump from an event this past weekend, Bristol Palin called him out for it.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "After Erick Erickson, the man in charge at RedState disinvited Donald Trump from an event this past weekend, Bristol Palin called him out for it.", "title": "Bristol Palin Holds Ground, Schools Bullies of RedState", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/bristol-palin-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-08-13T12:37:16-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/13/bristol-palin-holds-ground-schools-good-deed-bullies-of-redstate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After Erick Erickson, the man in charge at RedState disinvited Donald Trump from an event this past weekend, Bristol Palin called him out for it.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/bristol-palin-AP.jpg", "title": "Bristol Palin Holds Ground, Schools Bullies of RedState", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bristol Palin, Donald Trump, Erick Erickson, Good deed, Megyn Kelly, RedState, Sarah Palin,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,bristol palin", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-08-13T11:25:28-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-08-13T12:37:16-07:00", "tag": "Sarah Palin", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d07\"", "article_summary": "\u201cDon\u2019t act dumb and put your hands up in the air now, Mr. Erickson,\u201d Palin penned.\nWith another child on the way, Bristol Palin is a young woman who has her hands full.\nClearly these people don\u2019t understand some simple phrases like \u201cgood deed\u201d for example.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAfter Erick Erickson, the man in charge at RedState disinvited Donald Trump from an event this past weekend, Bristol Palin called him out for it.\nBristol Palin in her blog pointed to several misogynistic follies from RedState."}
