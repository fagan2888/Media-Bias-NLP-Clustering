Brookings, SD

A South Dakota State University climate specialist says the blizzard that hit western South Dakota two weeks ago and subsequent rains have erased drought conditions in the state.



Laura Edwards says the drought monitor map shows only lingering abnormally dry conditions in some areas.



Edwards say that since the beginning of October, rainfall totals have exceeded 2 inches in nearly every corner of South Dakota.



Parts of the Black Hills and Meade County have received more than 10 inches of water from the blizzard and rains.



Edwards says soil in some areas is saturated to a depth of 40 inches or more.



State Climatologist Dennis Todey says the snow and rain also came at a cost, killing livestock in western South Dakota and delaying corn and soybean harvesting.
