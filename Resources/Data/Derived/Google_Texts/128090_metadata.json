And given the abject weaknesses of her two most likely opponents, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, she seems likely to capture the White House this fall as well.\n\nSo the question now becomes: How does Hillary govern? She may win a decisive victory over a divided, dispirited Republican Party, but she will not return to the White House with much of the aura that surrounded President Obama. As feminist writer Carmille Paglia has pointed out, she is widely distrusted by the majority of Americans, including younger women. Older feminists may worship her as the incipient queen, she notes, but few others seem ready to kowtow.\n\nInstead , Clinton will enter the presidency more disliked and distrusted than any incoming executive in history. Her trajectory, notes Paglia, has more in common with that of Richard Nixon, whose persistent scheming and ample intellect, allowed him to win in 1968, another year marked by intense political divisions.\n\nAlternative one: Obama third term\n\nWhen Bill Clinton entered the White House in 1992, he did so as the standard-bearer for \u201cNew Democrats\u201d of the Democratic Leadership Council, a pro-business, pro-individual responsibility faction that captured control of the party from its labor and grievance industry old guard. When I worked for the Progressive Policy Institute, the DLC\u2019s think tank, in the early Clinton years, many powerful interests \u2014 greens, feminists, minority advocates, trade unions \u2014 opposed many of the Arkansan\u2019s policy innovations, ranging from welfare reform to NAFTA.\n\nBut the party that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton now inherits is not hers, it is Barack Obama\u2019s. In the Clinton years, Democrats competed, and sometimes won, in their strongholds in Appalachia and the South. After Obama, these areas are, for the most part, solidly GOP, while the party has become increasingly dependent on its heavily minority, and young, urban base along the coasts. As a result, there is little need for, or interest in, appeasing the less urbanized, more conservative voters across the country.\n\nEnergy and land use are two areas where Clinton may be able to pick up the Obama mantle. Despite Clinton\u2019s fundraising among fossil fuel firms, which has netted some $3 million, she has continually won established environmental support from groups like the League of Conservation Voters. She can be counted on to advance Obama\u2019s green agenda.\n\nIn effect, she will be tempted to support the mounting Environmental Protection Agency onslaught on power generators. This will hurt many Rust Belt economies but won\u2019t do much damage to party strongholds like Manhattan or the Bay Area. The Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s escalating campaign to force middle-class suburbs to accept more poor people and high-density housing may undermine the dreams and aspirations of millions of middle-class Americans, including many minorities, but could appeal to the urban developers who now can continue their ethnic cleansing of attractive inner-city areas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHillary, no stranger to following the political breezes, could simply serve as the heir to the Obama legacy, in effect, giving him a third term. She could prove to play the Stalin \u2014 ruthless, unlikeable but politically savvy \u2014 to advance the president\u2019s progressive program. There are signs of this, for example, in such things as her turn against the Keystone XL pipeline, after tentatively embracing it as secretary of state, or her rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. She might, under pressure from the Sanders forces, also agree on the platform plank for a ban on fracking, which would end our drive toward energy self-sufficiency, as well as deeply wound many economies, particularly in Texas, Oklahoma and Appalachia.\n\nTriangulation: Clinton third term?\n\nHillary Clinton has been forced left by the growing radicalization of her party. It\u2019s as if John Kasich and John McCain suddenly decided that they needed to sound like Donald Trump on immigration and Ted Cruz on religion. Yet, the big question is whether she will shift to the center, as her husband did, when she actually holds the reins of power.\n\nBut triangulation requires a strong and determined opposition, as Bill Clinton faced after 1994 with a GOP-controlled House run by Newt Gingrich. In states where the Republican Party has, for all intents and purposes, ceased to exist as a serious political force, such as here in California, moderation tends to be drowned out by the incessant yammering from the social justice warriors and environmental zealots. Gov. Jerry Brown, for example, is most often challenged not by Republicans but those from his left who want, if anything, more extreme economic and environmental policies.\n\nIf this year\u2019s election ends up with a total wipeout of the Republicans, Clinton would have little reason to move to the center. After all, you can not triangulate between right and left when the right has all but evaporated. If Hillary wants to reprise Bill, she should hope the GOP does not completely disappear as a political force.\n\nOne other, and particularly troublesome, barrier to triangulation could be the growing concentration of power in the executive branch under President Obama. Clinton has already made it clear she happily will rule by decree if the recalcitrant Republicans in the House refuse to go along with her ideas. With the bureaucracy allied with the progressive cause, and a judiciary that also increasingly embraces a centralist ideology, she may not need to appeal to Republicans or moderates at all, at least to get her program through.\n\nUltimately, this may all depend on the economy. President Obama\u2019s ratcheting up of federal housing and environmental powers has taken place amidst a gradually improving economy, particularly in his base coastal states. This has also been key to Gov. Brown\u2019s ever more draconian environmental stance. Prosperity, at least among the gentry, tends to let regulators ignore the economic consequences of their decisions.\n\nWhat matters most may be expediency \u2014 and money\n\nHillary Clinton is often castigated for her supposed lack of basic principles. Yet, for the country, her opportunism could benefit the country more than the kind narcissistic posturing that has dominated the Obama years. If the economy weakens, for example, she might not want to put more screws on businesses, and certainly will not threaten to persecute the financial interests who have financed her campaign, not to mention the Clinton Foundation.\n\nUnfortunately for her, many of the consequences for Obama\u2019s policies may force her hand. The president has delayed many of the more challenging parts of Obamacare, leaving it to Hillary to cope with cancellations, rising fees and other problems. Clinton will also be forced to deal with rising suburban resistance to HUD policy which, under the principle of \u201cdisparate impact,\u201d will try to force diversity and density on communities which do not discriminate but remain not dense enough or diverse enough to meet the demand of regulators.\n\nShe will also have to cope with other residues of the past eight years \u2014 for example, rising crime, growing race tensions and a rapidly deteriorating foreign environment. The new President Clinton may have to cope with mass unemployment in the energy belt and among manufacturers, as the administration\u2019s greenhouse gas policies begin to get implemented. Whereas President Obama benefited from the fracking boom that he never quite embraced, President Clinton may reap the full weight of the political and economic ramifications from ending the practice.\n\nWhether these realities \u2014 a direct threat to Democrats in many states and districts \u2014 will lead Clinton to adopt more pragmatic approaches is not yet knowable. But at the end of the day, arguably, our best hopes for the first woman president revolve around her profound opportunism and political common sense, which could lead her to a more pragmatic, and ultimately far less damaging, approach than now seems all too likely.\n\nJoel Kotkin is the R.C.
