ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Contestants vying for the Miss America title showed off some fancy footwear along a New Jersey boardwalk.

The traditional “Show Us Your Shoes” parade on Saturday featured 53 Miss America hopefuls riding down Atlantic City’s boardwalk in convertibles, each sporting creatively decorated shoes to evoke their home state.

The Press of Atlantic City (http://bit.ly/1sNaGkz) says Miss Louisiana, Lacey Sanchez, wore feathered magenta and green stilettos and carried a feathery umbrella in a nod to New Orleans’ Mardi Gras tradition.

Miss Oregon, Rebecca Anderson, had tiny bicycles on her shoes and wore a bike helmet since Portland is known as a bike-friendly city.

The next Miss America will be crowned during Sunday night’s nationally televised finale.
