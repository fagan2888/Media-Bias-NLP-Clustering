The Italian has won six times in 16 starts at the southern circuit in the top flight.\n\nThe nine-times world champion, who is 33 points behind Marquez and 12 adrift of Lorenzo, has now qualified on the front row for three successive races -- the first time he has done that since 2009.\n\nItalian Andrea Dovizioso will line up fourth for Ducati in Sunday's race, round four of the season, followed by five Spanish riders.\n\nBritain's Cal Crutchlow, 10th for LCR Honda, was the only non-Spanish or Italian rider in the top 10.\n\nThe session started late after final free practice was delayed because five out of the 10 Michelin tire fitters were laid low by sickness, meaning it took twice as long to prepare the bikes.\n\n(Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ed Osmond)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rossi beats Spanish rivals to pole in Jerez MotoGP - Reuters News:     (Reuters) - Italian veteran Valentino Rossi .05/27/2016 8:50:01AM EST.", "author": "Reuters News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "(Reuters) - Italian veteran Valentino Rossi stunned his Spanish rivals Jorge", "title": "Reuters News - Rossi beats Spanish rivals to pole in Jerez MotoGP", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/04/23/rossi-beats-spanish-rivals-to-pole-in-jerez-motogp-n2152805", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "(Reuters) - Italian veteran Valentino Rossi stunned his Spanish rivals Jorge", "title": "Reuters News - Rossi beats Spanish rivals to pole in Jerez MotoGP", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/04/23/rossi-beats-spanish-rivals-to-pole-in-jerez-motogp-n2152805", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Rossi beats Spanish rivals to pole in Jerez MotoGP, Reuters News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "(Reuters) - Italian veteran Valentino Rossi stunned his Spanish rivals Jorge Lorenzo and Marc Marquez by seizing pole position for their home MotoGP race in Jerez on Saturday.\nRossi's fastest time of one minute 38.736 seconds pushed Yamaha team mate and reigning world champion Lorenzo back to second place.\nItalian Andrea Dovizioso will line up fourth for Ducati in Sunday's race, round four of the season, followed by five Spanish riders.\nIt was also the 37-year-old's first pole in Jerez since 2005.\nThe pole was Rossi's first since last year's Dutch round in Assen and his 52nd in the top category."}
