We lost $2 trillion in American household wealth.\u201d\n\nBut as the shutdown drags on, there is frustration mixed with optimism in Minnesota. Eighth District Democratic Congressman Rick Nolan used a barnyard metaphor while blaming \u201cTea Party Republicans\u201d for the shutdown, but he\u2019s confident of finding a way out.\n\n\u201cYou know, we have a saying in the country with regards to optimism,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cWith all this horses\u2013t, there\u2019s got to be a horse somewhere.\u201d\n\nBut not everyone\u2019s willing to settle. Minnesota 6th District Republican Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, who founded the Congressional Tea Party Caucus, told the Values Voter Conference Friday that President Obama is turning the U.S. into a \u201cpolice-line state.\u201d She\u2019s urging conservatives to stay strong.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be ashamed that this fight is about Obamacare. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not ashamed,\u201d Bachmann said. \u201cThis is consequential because it is life and death for the American people and for the American economy. It\u2019s worth fighting over.\u201d\n\nBut 2nd District Republican Congressman John Kline said he\u2019s still looking for a bi-partisan agreement to end the shutdown. Kline spokesman Troy Young issued this statement:\n\n\u201cMinnesotans don\u2019t want a government shutdown and neither does Congressman Kline. He\u2019ll continue to fight on their behalf by putting principle ahead of politics and encourage members from both parties from the House and Senate to work together toward a long-term solution that responsibly tackles our nation\u2019s debt and spending crisis.\u201d\n\nMinn. Fifth District Democratic Congressman Keith Ellison, who is co-chair of the U.S. House Progressive Caucus, says he welcomes a possible compromise, but not if it includes changes to the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I am going to vote for because I want to read the bill first,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cBut I will tell you short term doesn\u2019t work, and we will not go back to the days when people went bankrupt because they got sick.\u201d\n\nSen. Klobuchar credits moderate Senators from both parties for helping negotiate a deal, but specifically singled out moderate, female U.S. Senators. Klobuchar says they got \u201csick and tired\u201d of people throwing insults at each other on TV.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s 20 women Senators out of 100 Senators,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we have dinner together about once a month. We work on bills together constantly, and so we talk. We have good, strong relationships of trust.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Minnesota senator is one of the key players hammering out a deal that could end the federal government shutdown.
