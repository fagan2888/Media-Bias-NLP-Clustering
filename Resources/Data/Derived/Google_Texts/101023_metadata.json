Kerry, and Deval Patrick, has overseen a phone survey this month on behalf of the church, asking active and inactive Catholics a wide-ranging series of 90 questions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey include: How often do you go to Mass? Should women have a larger leadership role in the church? Is your opinion of Cardinal Sean P. O\u2019Malley very favorable, favorable, unfavorable, or very unfavorable?\n\nAnd: Have you seen the movie \u201cSpotlight?\u201d How well do you think the church has responded to the abuse crisis in recent years?\n\nChurch spokesman Terrence C. Donilon said the poll is part of a \u201cresearch study on strategic direction\u201d designed to help the church do a better job serving the estimated 1.8 million baptized Catholics in the archdiocese. Only about 16 percent attend Mass every week, down from 70 percent in 1970, according to church figures.\n\n\u201cWe want to be good listeners, and we want to be good learners,\u201d Donilon said. \u201cIf you are not in conversation with the people, you\u2019re not listening.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the randomized phone survey of 1,600 Catholics, Marttila\u2019s firm will convene six 90-minute focus groups for in-depth conversations about participants\u2019 religious and spiritual lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe poll includes questions about church doctrine. Participants are asked at one point: Which best reflects your attitude about abortion? 1) It is morally wrong and should not be legal; 2) It is morally wrong but should be legal; or 3) It is morally acceptable and should be legal.\n\nSurveys have repeatedly shown that many American Catholics disagree with the church\u2019s teaching; for example, the vast majority of Catholics ignore the church\u2019s prohibition on birth control, and have for years. The possibility of changing teaching on that issue barely came up in Rome last month when prelates gathered to discuss issues related to family life.\n\nBut specialists said the research could help the church understand how people are relating to its teachings, and how to communicate them better, even if it does not plan to change them.\n\nPolling could also help the church learn how to make itself more accessible, they said.\n\nSusan Fournier, who teaches marketing at Boston University\u2019s Questrom School of Business, said the Metropolitan Opera decided to simulcast operas in movie theaters outside New York after audience research showed that many fans still loved opera \u2014 but not the effort and cost of attending a live production.\n\nShe said the church\u2019s impulse to solicit the opinions of the faithful seems to align with Pope Francis\u2019s \u201cmore human\u201d approach to the papacy.\n\n\u201cThis is a big signal of the new Catholic brand that is much more approachable, much more transparent, much more willing to listen,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it actually fits with everything that is going on: \u2018We care what you think, and we want to listen.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u2018I think it actually fits with everything that is going on: \u201cWe care what you think, and we want to listen.\u201d \u2019\n\nDonilon would not say how much the study costs or how it will be paid for, but he said the archdiocese would release that information in its annual financial report next year.\n\nHe said the study was developed over the course of the last year, and its timing had nothing to do with the release of \u201cSpotlight,\u201d a film about The Boston Globe\u2019s 2002 investigation of the church\u2019s coverup of sexual abuse of children by clergy. He said church leaders nevertheless thought it made sense to include a question about the movie.\n\nDonilon said the study was an outgrowth of statewide research conducted in 2012 for a ballot question on physician-assisted suicide. The church led a coalition of interests in defeating that measure through a multimillion-dollar ad campaign.\n\nThe present study, he said, \u201cis about having a better understanding of what is on the hearts and minds of the Catholic community in the Archdiocese of Boston.\u201d\n\nMarttila, in addition to political work, has conducted national opinion polls for a range of corporations and nonprofits. According to its website, some of the firm\u2019s recent research has explored American views on Israel for the Anti-Defamation League; attitudes toward medical imaging exams for the American College of Radiology; and opinion on the Affordable Care Act for the health care technology company IMS Health.\n\nThe church phone survey takes about 25 minutes to answer, a major time investment for respondents.\n\nDonilon declined to release the questions, though he confirmed the queries posed to one respondent, Jennifer Haigh, a novelist who lives in Roslindale \u2014 and whose 2011 book, \u201cFaith,\u201d concerns a Boston priest accused of sexual abuse.\n\nHaigh said she was so surprised and curious when she got the call that she decided to stay on the line.\n\n\u201cI was all set to hang up \u2014 and I would have hung up if it had been about anything else \u2014 but it was just so weird, I wanted to know what they were going to ask,\u201d she said.\n\nFournier said the Catholic Church appears to be grappling with classic marketing problems: \u201c \u2018We\u2019re not getting new users, our image is tarnished, we\u2019re not attracting youth,\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nBoston University\u2019s Fournier said market research \u201cis exactly what the business discipline would suggest: Go to the people, find out what they\u2019re thinking and use that to inform decisions.\u201d\n\nPolling and other research tools are not new to the Catholic church. A half-century ago, Cardinal Richard Cushing, the archbishop of Boston, spearheaded the founding of the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate, at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., to use social science research to better understand the church and its people.\n\nThe center conducts surveys for Catholic organizations and institutions, including some dioceses, helping the church understand the future of the priesthood, demographic trends, and Catholic school enrollment, among many other topics.\n\nThe Rev. Thomas Gaunt, the center\u2019s director, said its national polls have revealed that many inactive Catholics still pray and embrace theological doctrine such as the Trinity \u2014 but don\u2019t attend Mass regularly because they find it boring or don\u2019t feel welcome.\n\nAs a former pastor, Gaunt said, he found it helpful to know the exodus from churches might be something he could do something about.\n\nAs a pastor, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not creating the doctrine, but I am the one who creates a welcoming environment. I am the one who creates interesting sermons.\u201d\n\nJack Connors, a major donor to Catholic schools and a former advertising executive, said he was not involved in the study. But he said its aim is probably not to reengage people who haven\u2019t been to Mass in 30 years so much as to reach those who are less active, but open to getting involved again.\n\n\u201cIt might help get some people to remember that the church, and really all faiths, have some very good service attributes, and maybe they can help us with . . . [services for] kids, elderly, the poor,\u201d Connors said.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.1.1386761074", "eomportal-id": 492889, "description": "Questions include: How often do you go to Mass?
