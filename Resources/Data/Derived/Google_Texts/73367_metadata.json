(Reuters)\n\nYou can never be far from the center of any discussion of the \u201cRoberts court\u201d when your name is John G. Roberts Jr.\n\nBut as the Supreme Court last week ended a decade of oral arguments under the chief justice\u2019s leadership, Roberts came in for special attention as not only the public face of the court but also its most scrutinized player.\n\nThere\u2019s good reason for that.\n\nIn one of the court\u2019s two blockbuster cases, about the implementation and continued viability of President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, Roberts is likely to play the pivotal role.\n\nIn the other, about same-sex marriage, Roberts was the only one of the nine justices last week who appeared to be searching for a middle ground that might allow the court to hold off on deciding whether the Constitution requires states to allow gay couples to marry.\n\n[Supreme Court divided over same-sex marriage case]\n\nAnd in cases that the court has decided this term, less than half of the docket, Roberts already has surprised.\n\nIn a case involving former UPS employee Peggy Young, he sided with liberals to make it easier for pregnant workers to sue if employers do not provide health-related accommodations to their work routines.\n\nAnd last week he faced the wrath of fellow conservatives for breaking a streak of decisions invalidating campaign-finance regulations as unconstitutional restrictions on free speech. Roberts wrote for a five-member majority that said Florida and other states were free to forbid judicial candidates from directly soliciting campaign contributions.\n\nAs long as the court is ideologically divided, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy will most often remain the court\u2019s tie-breaker in major cases.\n\nBut the 60-year-old Roberts is the court\u2019s future. If he zigs when everyone thinks he\u2019s going to zag, reporters, law professors and legal commentators go on the alert. Headline writers at the New Republic got ahead of the author\u2019s analysis when they wondered last week, \u201cIs John Roberts Drifting Left?\u201d But you get the idea.\n\nRoberts\u2019s decision in the judicial campaign contributions case is the most surprising of the term. At oral argument earlier this year in Williams-Yulee v. The Florida Bar \u2014 challenging the state\u2019s rules that say a judicial candidate must use a committee to raise campaign funds rather than directly asking for contributions \u2014 Roberts sounded as if his mind were made up.\n\n\u201cYou have a situation where the people in the state have said we\u2019re going to have judges elected and we\u2019re going to recognize that you can contribute to judges because of there are contribution limits,\u201d Roberts told the lawyer representing the bar.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me you\u2019re under a great burden trying to figure out how you\u2019re going to fix that without contravening the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nRoberts figured it out himself. Florida\u2019s rule \u201cadvances the state\u2019s compelling interest in preserving public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is therefore one of the rare cases in which a speech restriction withstands\u201d a free-speech challenge.\n\nKennedy and Justice Antonin Scalia wrote bristling dissents about how Roberts \u201cflattened\u201d First Amendment precedents, in Scalia\u2019s words. Roberts replied that the two should take a deep breath.\n\nRoberts mocked Scalia\u2019s assertion that Florida\u2019s rule suggested a hostility to electing judges and had \u201cnothing to do with the appearances created by judges\u2019 asking for money.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing?\u201d Roberts replied.\n\nLikewise, he accused Kennedy of overheated rhetoric, noting his dissent\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cstate censorship\u201d and its charge that the rule \u201csilenced\u201d public debate.\n\n\u201cA reader of Justice Kennedy\u2019s dissent could be forgiven for concluding that the court has just upheld a latter-day version of the Alien and Sedition Acts,\u201d Roberts wrote.\n\nThe opinion instead reinforced two of Roberts\u2019s chief themes. One is that judges are different. It is something he has preached to a public increasingly angry about partisanship in all levels of government.\n\n[John Roberts\u2019 s dream of a nonpartisan court]\n\nAnd second, Roberts made clear that almost all other forms of campaign regulation, save perhaps disclosure, are suspect.\n\n\u201cPoliticians are expected to be appropriately responsive to the preferences of their supporters,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cIndeed, such \u2018responsiveness is key to the very concept of self-governance through elected officials.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRoberts was quoting himself, from last term\u2019s ruling in McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission striking down aggregate limits on campaign contributions.\n\nBoth for the campaign-finance decision and the chief justice\u2019s potential role in the court\u2019s coming decisions on Obamacare and same-sex marriage, Roberts became the main topic of conversation when the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center held a panel discussion about the term last week.\n\n\u201cI think arguably this term is going to be the defining term for the Roberts court,\u201d said Elizabeth B. Wydra, the group\u2019s chief counsel.\n\nShe held out hope that Roberts, who dissented in the U.S. v. Windsor decision striking down part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, would find a way to rule for same-sex marriage in the current case. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible,\u201d she said cautiously.\n\nPaul M. Smith, a lawyer who has been involved in the major gay rights cases before the court, thought that unlikely. \u201cHe\u2019d basically have to eat his dissent in the DOMA case,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSmith said that the test for Roberts will be the fight over the Affordable Care Act, where challengers say the words of the statute do not allow subsidies for those who buy health insurance on a federal exchange, only those set up by states.\n\nIf Roberts votes for a technical reading of the law instead of agreeing with the administration about the intent of Congress in passing the legislation, Smith said, \u201cthat will change how he is perceived for quite a while.\u201d\n\n(Conservatives complain that liberals think the only way the court can be perceived as nonpartisan is for the Republican-appointed justices to agree with the administration. Why wouldn\u2019t it be just as nonpartisan for the Democratic-appointed justices to decide the administration is wrong, they say.)\n\nThe conservative on last week\u2019s panel, Yaakov Roth, a Washington lawyer who clerked for Scalia, said he didn\u2019t think Roberts\u2019s legacy would be determined by either case.\n\nA defeat for the Obama administration in the health-care case would be a victory for Scalia\u2019s advocacy of a textualist reading of the law, Roth said.\n\nSame-sex marriage and gay rights are linked to Kennedy, he said, and Roberts need not worry about his legacy if he finds there is no constitutional right to marriage.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how this case is going to be seen in 30 or 50 years,\u201d Roth said. \u201cBut he\u2019s certainly not the only person on the court who is skeptical of this claim. I think 10 years ago, everyone on the court might have been skeptical of this claim.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The chief justice is likely to play a pivotal role in the Obamacare case and has surprised on others.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The chief justice is likely to play a pivotal role in the Obamacare case and has surprised on others.", "title": "Roberts at center stage as Supreme Court approaches historic decisions", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/roberts-at-center-stage-as-supreme-court-approaches-historic-decisions/2015/05/03/4b9401c6-f004-11e4-8666-a1d756d0218e_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/05/04/Web-Resampled/2015-05-03/2015-04-27T150813Z_01_TOR105_RTRIDSP_3_USA-COURT-GAYMARRIAGE-JUSTICES-kivC--296x197@wp.com.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@scotusreporter"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/roberts-at-center-stage-as-supreme-court-approaches-historic-decisions/2015/05/03/4b9401c6-f004-11e4-8666-a1d756d0218e_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "courts", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139"}, "eomportal-uuid": "4b9401c6-f004-11e4-8666-a1d756d0218e", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "courts"}, "article_summary": "(Reuters)You can never be far from the center of any discussion of the \u201cRoberts court\u201d when your name is John G.
