(Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1997).\n\nA common historicist fallacy is to import our twentieth-century conceptions into the minds of the Founders. At the adoption of the Constitution the notion that judges, for example, could make law as an instrument of social change was altogether alien to colonial thinking. \u201cInstrumentalism\u201d was yet to come. In a valuable essay Morton J. Horwitz observed that \u201cfear of judicial discretion had long been part of colonial political rhetoric\u201d and described the prevalent jural conceptions that combined to circumscribe the judicial function in the eighteenth century.\n\nThere was first the fact that the common law rules\u2014that is, judicially enunciated rules in the field of contracts and the like\u2014 \u201cwere conceived of as \u2018 founded in principles, that are permanent, uniform and universal.\u2019 \u201d Consequently, judges \u201cconceived their role as merely that of discovering and applying preexisting legal rules\u201d and derived \u201cthe rule of strict precedent\u201d from such \u201cpreexisting standards discoverable by judges.\u201d It followed that \u201cjudicial innovation itself was regarded as an impermissible exercise of will.\u201d\n\nHorwitz cites the statement of Chief Justice Hutchinson of Massachusetts in 1767: \u201cthe Judge should never be theLegislator: Because then the Will of the Judge would be the Law: and this tends to a State of Slavery.\u201d Not long afterward Edward Gibbon wrote, \u201cthe discretion of the judge is the first engine of tyranny.\u201d Horwitz concluded that \u201cIn eighteenth century America, common law rules were not regarded as instruments of social change; whatever legal change took place generally was brought about through legislation . . . American judges . . . almost never self-consciously employed the common law as a creative instrument for directing men\u2019s energies towards social change.\u201d Those who would rest an implied power of judges to act as such instruments of social change in the field of constitutional law have the burden of producing evidence that the Framers intended to depart from these norms. The exclusion of judges from the Council of Revision alone points to the contrary.\n\n\u201cInstrumentalism,\u201d Horwitz shows, largely began to develop in the early nineteenth century\u2014after the adoption of the Constitution; the examples he cites are all drawn from application of common law; not once is a judicial claim of power to alter a statute, let alone a constitution, asserted. To such negative implications may be added Hamilton\u2019s statement in the very context of judicial review (Federalist No. 78), that the judicial role is one of \u201cjudgment\u201d not \u201cwill,\u201d that \u201cto avoid arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and precedents, which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them.\u201d\n\nWhat could be further from the current freewheeling conception of judicial review than these words by the foremost apologist for judicial review, designed to reassure opponents of ratification? Courts were not merely to be \u201cbound down\u201d by the \u201cchains of the Constitution,\u201d but by \u201cstrict rules and precedents\u201d as well. Even when the tide began to turn toward instrumentalism, Judge William Cranch of the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia stated in his preface to 1 Cranch of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions (1803): \u201cIn a government which is emphatically stiled a government of laws, the least possible range ought to be left for the discretion of the judge.\u201d\n\nThere are also contemporary judicial statements that display the circumspection with which the judges approached the novel task of judicial review. In one of the earliest State cases, Commonwealth v. Caton(1782), Edmund Pendleton, president of the highest Virginia court, stated: \u201chow far this court . . . can go in declaring an act of the Legislature void, because it is repugnant to the Constitution, without exercising the Power of Legislation, from which they are restrained by the same Constitution? is a deep, important, and I will add, an awful question\u201d \u2014which, he rejoiced, he had no occasion to decide. Subsequently, Pendleton served as the presiding officer of the Virginia Ratification Convention, and it is unlikely that he translated the examples furnished by his colleagues, all addressed to checking encroachments on reserved powers, into unlimited power of review.\n\nNo one remotely intimated that there would be judicial power to rewrite the Constitution. Nothing could have been better calculated to defeat ratification than a claim of judicial power that would leave the States altogether at the mercy of the federal courts; and such State jealousy was met by the Judiciary Act of 1789 which withheld from the inferior federal courts jurisdiction of cases \u201carising under\u201d the Constitution.\n\nEven with respect to the policing function, Justice James Iredell, who had been one of the most cogent advocates of judicial review, stated in 1798 that the power to declare a legislative act \u201cvoid is of a delicate and awful nature, [hence] the Court will never resort to that authority but in a clear and urgent case.\u201d In M\u2019Culloch v. Maryland Chief Justice Marshall indicated that something like a \u201cbold and plain usurpation to which the constitution gave no countenance\u201d was required \u201cto invoke the judicial power of annulment.\u201d And in 1824 he averred that \u201cjudicial power is never exercised for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the judge; always for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the legislature.\u201d\n\nFor Chief Judge Cardozo, Marshall\u2019s statement was the expression \u201cof an ideal,\u201d which \u201cMarshall\u2019s own career\u201d illustrates \u201cis beyond the reach of human faculties to attain.\u201d It would be more accurate to say, as Charles L. Black pointed out, that it reflected the colonists\u2019 conception that \u201cLaw is a body of existing and determinate rules,\u201d which \u201c is to be ascertained \u201d by the judge by consulting \u201cstatutes, precedents and the rest,\u201d and that \u201cthe function of the judge was thus placed in sharpest antithesis to that of the legislator,\u201d who alone was concerned \u201cwith what the law ought to be.\u201d\n\nSo Marshall understood the judicial role: \u201cCourts are mere instruments of the law and can will nothing. When they are said to exercise a discretion, it is a mere legal discretion, a discretion to be exercised in discerning the course prescribed by law \u201d \u2014that is, by the legislators or the people gathered in Convention.\n\nMarshall, it needs always to be remembered, had fought on behalf of judicial review in the Virginia Ratification Convention and was well aware of the views entertained by the Founders. His 1824 statement confirms that among the presuppositions the Founders brought to the several conventions was a bias against judicial discretion and policymaking.\n\nThere is no evidence whatsoever that these presuppositions were thrown overboard in the creation of the judiciary. To the contrary, the established presumption is that the Founders created a judiciary in familiar terms, except insofar as they envisaged its \u201cpolicing\u201d function. Judicial alteration of the fundamental law ran counter to their belief in a \u201cfixed Constitution\u201d; it was altogether outside their contemplation, as Hamilton made plain. Justice Frankfurter, therefore, was close to the mark in stating that the Framers were on guard \u201cagainst the self-will of the courts.\u201d\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nRelated posts", "article_metadata": {"description": "A common historicist fallacy is to import our twentieth-century conceptions into the minds of the Founders", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "og": {"site_name": "Tenth Amendment Center", "description": "A common historicist fallacy is to import our twentieth-century conceptions into the minds of the Founders", "title": "Judicial \"Discretion\" in 1787", "url": "http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2015/05/02/judicial-discretion-in-1787/", "image": "http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bigstock-Supreme-Court-Building-Washin-65075716-small.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bigstock-Supreme-Court-Building-Washin-65075716-small.png", "description": "A common historicist fallacy is to import our twentieth-century conceptions into the minds of the Founders", "card": "summary", "title": "Judicial \"Discretion\" in 1787"}, "fb": {"pages": 143173285763}, "keywords": "judiciary", "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/tenthamendmentcenter", "tag": "judiciary", "published_time": "2015-05-02T11:03:21Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-01T10:05:01Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd4ca\"", "article_summary": "His 1824 statement confirms that among the presuppositions the Founders brought to the several conventions was a bias against judicial discretion and policymaking.\nIn a valuable essay Morton J.
