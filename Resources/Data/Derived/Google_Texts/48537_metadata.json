Blake Farenthold, R-Corpus Christi, called North Texas \u201cground zero\u201d for navigator problems.\n\nHe and Issa were joined by three noncommittee members, all Republicans, who spoke against President Barack Obama\u2019s signature law.\n\n\u201cThis is one of a series of field hearings by Congressman Issa investigating the shortcomings of Obamacare,\u201d Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Dallas, told nearly 200 people at the Eisemann Center.\n\nRep. Randy Neugebauer, R-Lubbock, and Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Lewisville, were the other two Texans speaking against the new law.\n\nRep. Marc Veasey, D-Fort Worth, another noncommittee member, spoke in favor of the law. He urged the gathering to focus on the Texans who remain uncovered because state leaders decided not to expand Medicaid.\n\nBut the hearing focused on navigators and an undercover video that purported to show several North Texas women urging an insurance applicant to lie. They were training as navigators in Irving.\n\nAs proof, the committee played a video clip from a Fox News report. It showed two women telling an applicant that he should hide his extra income and the fact that he was a smoker. Such lies would lower his insurance premiums, they said.\n\nDr. Randy Farris, regional administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, testified that his agency took the video seriously. The agency oversees the new law\u2019s rollout.\n\n\u201cCMS took immediate action to decertify the navigators and issue a detailed corrective-action plan,\u201d he said.\n\nThe employees were subsequently suspended. Farris declined to specify whether they were fired.\n\nThe Urban League of Greater Dallas employed the two women. The group beefed up navigator training to assure they follow the law, Farris said. His agency promised to make unannounced visits to observe the agency\u2019s work.\n\nThe Republican congressmen did not sound appeased. They described wider potential for problems, given the number of agencies providing navigators.\n\nThe federal government is paying nearly $11 million to eight community organizations that supervise navigators, said Farris. The agencies have good standing and no reason to flout the law, he said.\n\nIssa said the potential for navigator abuse was so great that Texas insurance regulators should take further action. He urged the state to move forward with rules that would prevent identity theft and other criminal behavior.\n\nIn early December, the Texas Department of Insurance proposed background checks and 40 hours\u2019 additional training for navigators. Such workers now undergo online training and exams that could take five to 20 hours.\n\nNeugebauer said he worried that navigator candidates were not being properly vetted and had access to Social Security numbers and family incomes.\n\nBurgess said he had \u201cno confidence\u201d in the way the new law was working, given the problems with the signup website, HealthCare.gov.\n\nIssa asked Farris whether he knew that all applicant information ended up on the federal site. Farris said private information was not stored there.\n\n\u201cYou need to watch more Fox, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d Issa said.\n\nThat drew scattered boos from the audience, which included dozens of the law\u2019s supporters.\n\nSeveral pro-Obamacare groups held a news conference before the hearing began.\n\nThe speakers described the hardship of being sick without having insurance. One said his family ended up with $250,000 in medical debt after his father suffered a heart attack.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They cite problems with training and the lack of background checks and fingerprinting for those on the job.", "og": {"description": "They cite problems with training and the lack of background checks and fingerprinting for those on the job.", "title": "Texas congressmen take aim at Affordable Care Act\u2019s navigators", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/richardson-lake-highlands/headlines/20131216-texas-congressmen-take-aim-at-affordable-care-acts-navigators.ece", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131216-nm_16hearing1.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NM_16Hearing1.jpg", "height": 312}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2013-12-17T05:16:43Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2013-12-17T04:52:31Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Texas congressmen take aim at Affordable Care Act\\u2019s navigators\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/richardson-lake-highlands/headlines/20131216-texas-congressmen-take-aim-at-affordable-care-acts-navigators.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131216-nm_16rally.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/NM_16Rally.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1346308\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-12-17T04:52:31Z\", \"section\": \"Richardson Lake Highlands Headlines\", \"author\": \"SHERRY JACOBSON\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20131216-nm_16rally.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/NM_16Rally.jpg", "publishtime": "2013-12-17T04:52:31Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd371\"", "article_summary": "RICHARDSON \u2014 Four Texas congressmen took aim Monday at the federally paid navigators who are helping Texans access insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act.\nBut the hearing focused on navigators and an undercover video that purported to show several North Texas women urging an insurance applicant to lie.\nThe hearing focused on required navigator training and the lack of background checks and fingerprinting for those on the job.\nIssa said the potential for navigator abuse was so great that Texas insurance regulators should take further action.\nIn early December, the Texas Department of Insurance proposed background checks and 40 hours\u2019 additional training for navigators."}
