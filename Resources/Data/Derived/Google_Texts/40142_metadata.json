About $741,000 of those losses comes from depreciation of state-owned assets at the 80-acre fairgrounds in Pueblo.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to legislators to help out a little more. The fair, which is a state agency under the state Department of Agriculture, is asking for roughly the difference, $550,000 through the governor\u2019s budget office to help close the gap. Legislator\u2019s put in some extra money last year, as well.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember, Wiseman points out, that the fair itself is a moneymaker. Expenses outside the control of the midway eat up its profits and then some. Besides maintaining the fairgrounds\u2019 buildings year round, the fair also absorbs about $450,000 in programs for 4-H kids and Future Farmers of America, promoting the Colorado\u2019s next generation of ag producers.\n\nAnd you don\u2019t get a full picture of the fair\u2019s value just by looking at what it costs onsite. In 2011, an economic impact study concluded Colorado gets a $33.8 million economic benefit from\n\nthe Fair each year, plus the equivalent of 374 full-time jobs. The study indicated about $24.6 million of that impact is in Pueblo County, an area of the state that lawmakers have said is lagging in the economic recovery.\n\n\u201cThe issue is if you\u2019re going to have this fair and have all the things that come along with it, then you have to fund it,\u201d Wiseman said after hearing from some legislators concerned about the size of the operating losses. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to have a fair, then that\u2019s a decision you have to make.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s also the issue of heritage and national exposure. The fair started in 1872, four years before Colorado was a state. The site also is home to the National Little Britches Rodeo Finals, which brings about 900 competitors ages 5 to 18, along with their families and friends, to Pueblo each July.\n\nJohn Salazar, who stepped down as state agriculture commissioner this month, is optimistic the fair is on a rebound. He appointed himself to the State Fair Board during his tenure, and said he hopes to keep that seat as he returns to the San Luis Valley to work full-time the Salazar family\u2019s large farming operation there.\n\nSalazar said that with the budget cuts and other changes the fair has made in the past year, it\u2019s well on its way to solvency.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very optimistic about the direction the fair headed in,\u201d he said before last week\u2019s audit was released.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Chris Wiseman,Colorado Department of Agriculture,Colorado State Fair,John Salazar", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "Chris Wiseman, general manager of the Colorado State Fair, said the $3.3 million in operating losses show in last week's audit doesn't paint a full picture.", "title": "Colorado State Fair is more than its losses", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/01/20/state-fair-can-wrangle-deficit-taxpayers-help-support/116637/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/01/CDSTATEFAIR_KN24474-495x329.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Chris Wiseman, general manager of the Colorado State Fair, said the $3.3 million in operating losses show in last week's audit doesn't paint a full picture.", "title": "State Fair can wrangle deficit if taxpayers help support it", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2015/01/20/state-fair-can-wrangle-deficit-taxpayers-help-support/116637/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/files/2015/01/CDSTATEFAIR_KN24474-495x329.jpg", "creator": "@joeybunch", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Chris Wiseman, general manager of the Colorado State Fair, said the $3.3 million in operating losses show in last week's audit doesn't paint a full picture."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc6b5\"", "article_summary": "The nearly $3.3 million in operating losses the Colorado State Fair had showing in a state audit released last week isn\u2019t as deep a hole as that big number makes it seem, according to Chris Wiseman, the general manager of the operation.\nIn 2011, an economic impact study concluded Colorado gets a $33.8 million economic benefit fromthe Fair each year, plus the equivalent of 374 full-time jobs.\nThe fair started in 1872, four years before Colorado was a state.\nThe fair, which is a state agency under the state Department of Agriculture, is asking for roughly the difference, $550,000 through the governor\u2019s budget office to help close the gap.\nJohn Salazar, who stepped down as state agriculture commissioner this month, is optimistic the fair is on a rebound."}
