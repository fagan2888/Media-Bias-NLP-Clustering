Danis Zaripov also scored a goal and added two assists.\n\nViktor Tikhonov and Sergei Shirokov scored a goal each.\n\nPutin watched the game sitting next to Belarus\u2019 authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko in the stands, as the Russian team gained a measure of redemption following a painful loss to Finland in the quarterfinals of the Sochi Olympics just three months ago. It was Russia\u2019s fifth gold since the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe worlds was the first major competition for new Russia coach Oleg Znarok, who has been tasked with reviving the team after the Sochi let-down. Znarok was suspended for the final, however, after making a cut-throat gesture toward a Sweden player in the semifinals.\n\nHis team cruised through this tournament from the start, winning all its 10 games. The Russians scored the most goals of any team (42) and concede the least (10).\n\nRussia took the lead through Shirokov midway through the first period on a power play, but Iiro Pekarinen leveled just three seconds before the interval.\n\nIn the second, Olli Palola scored a power-play goal on a rebound to put the Finns ahead, before Ovechkin and Malkin lived up to their billing as the star attraction of the tournament.\n\nZaripov added the fourth with a slap shot past Finland goaltender Pekka Rinne on a power play in the third before Tikhonov completed the victory on another power play.\n\nTikhonov finished as the tournament\u2019s top scorer with eight goals.\n\nZnarok joined his celebrating players on the ice after the game.\n\nEarlier, Sweden beat the Czech Republic 3-0 to claim the bronze.\n\nJoakim Lindstrom scored early and Simon Hjalmarsson netted another one in the opening period for Sweden to take control.\n\nMikael Backlund rounded off the win with a wrist shot past goaltender Alexander Salak in the third.\n\n\u201cWe came here to win the gold,\u201d Lindstrom said. \u201cThat was our goal. But the competition is very, very hard, and all in all it was a pretty good tournament for us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the victory, Russia avenged a loss to Finland in the quarterfinals in the Sochi Olympics and earned its fifth gold since the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union.", "Author": "Karel Janicek", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With the victory, Russia avenged a loss to Finland in the quarterfinals in the Sochi Olympics and earned its fifth gold since the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union.", "title": "Alex Ovechkin, Russia win hockey world championship", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/25/alex-ovechkin-russia-win-hockey-world-championship/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/25/belarus-hockey-worlds_lanc2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/25/belarus-hockey-worlds_lanc2.jpg", "title": "Alex Ovechkin, Russia win hockey world championship", "description": "With the victory, Russia avenged a loss to Finland in the quarterfinals in the Sochi Olympics and earned its fifth gold since the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Sports, Finland, Russia, Evgeni Malkin, Alexander Ovechkin"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcada7\"", "article_summary": "Zaripov added the fourth with a slap shot past Finland goaltender Pekka Rinne on a power play in the third before Tikhonov completed the victory on another power play.\nRussia took the lead through Shirokov midway through the first period on a power play, but Iiro Pekarinen leveled just three seconds before the interval.\nMINSK, Belarus \u2014 Star forwards Alex Ovechkin and Evgeni Malkin scored eight minutes apart to lead Russia to a 5-2 victory over Finland in the final of the ice hockey world championship on Sunday for its second title in three years.\nJoakim Lindstrom scored early and Simon Hjalmarsson netted another one in the opening period for Sweden to take control.\nMikael Backlund rounded off the win with a wrist shot past goaltender Alexander Salak in the third."}
