Officials with Oklahoma City Public Schools announced they would be cutting 92 administrative positions due to the ongoing budget crisis.

The cuts come in addition to 208 teaching positions that OKCPS announced in March.

The cuts represent an 18-percent reduction in administrative staff. The staff reductions break down to 59 jobs from the central office administration and 33 jobs from school site administration.

According to a press release, the cuts will save the Oklahoma City school system approximately $5.1 million for the 2016-2017 school year. An additional $17 million is expected to be cut from programs, services and operations. The district plans to announce those reductions in the coming weeks.

OKCPS is working toward freeing up $30-million in funds for next year.
