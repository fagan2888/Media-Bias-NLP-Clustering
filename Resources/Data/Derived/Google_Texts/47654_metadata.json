But to me, the most striking is how much the stories coming out of the VA resemble those that come out of the British National Health Service: like the VA, a fully socialized system in which the government owns the hospitals, employs the doctors, and serves as the insurer.\n\nThis is an important point, one I discuss in a lengthy piece for Forbes today. Obamacare, for all its faults, is not technically socialized medicine. It\u2019s part single-payer (Medicaid), and part subsidized/regulated/privatized (the exchanges). There is no health care system in America that is more government-driven, with all of the unaccountability and dishonesty therein, than the VA.\n\nSo if the VA is more socialized than even Obamacare is, why haven\u2019t Republicans taken it on? In part because they\u2019ve been afraid to. While many vets are dissatisfied with the care they get in the VA system, Republicans haven\u2019t done the heavy lifting necessary to show that private-sector reforms could offer veterans better coverage and better care:\n\nOn Veteran\u2019s Day in 2011, Mitt Romney met with a group of veterans in South Carolina. The vets shared with him their difficulty in getting treatment from VA hospitals. Observed Romney, \u201cIf you\u2019re the government, they know there\u2019s nowhere else you guys can go. You\u2019re stuck. Sometimes you wonder if there would be some way to introduce some private-sector competition, somebody else that could come in and say, you know, that each soldier gets X thousand dollars attributed to them, and then they can choose whether they want to go in the government system or in a private system with the money that follows them.\u201d\n\nFor this innocuous and appropriate suggestion, Romney was pilloried by the usual suspects on the left\u2014but also, inexcusably, by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, whose spokesperson said, \u201cThe VFW doesn\u2019t support privatization of veterans\u2019 health care.\u201d Romney, stung by the VFW\u2019s rebuke, walked back his suggestion, and Republicans have stayed silent on it ever since.\n\nBut this may be starting to change:\n\nUntil now. On Wednesday, Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) told Roll Call that he was working with Sens. Tom Coburn (R., Okla.) and Richard Burr (R., N.C.) on a new reform plan. \u201cLet\u2019s let our veterans choose the health care that they need and want the most and not have to be bound to just going to the VA\u2026Why wouldn\u2019t a veteran who has served his country honorably . . . not be able to go to the health care provider of his or her choice?\u201d\n\nThis is a promising development. Put simply, veterans will continue to suffer until they have the option to buy private coverage and seek private care. The premium support approach will allow the government to provide maximum subsidies to those who have suffered serious injuries in combat, and provide conventional subsidies to non-combat veterans who deserve traditional health coverage.\n\nMuch of the noise among Republicans in Congress is about making sure that \u201cheads roll\u201d in the VA scandal. But appointing a new Secretary of Veterans Affairs won\u2019t do a dime\u2019s bit of difference. Without fundamental changes, the VA\u2019s flawed socialist model will remain intact.
