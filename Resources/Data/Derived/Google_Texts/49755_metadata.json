Thankfully, no children were on the bus, but instead drugs were found.\n\nPolice said 58-year-old Mid-Del Schools bus driver Odis Pitts, who was on his way to pick up students, weaved in and out of traffic along S.E. 15th Street from I-35 to Santa Fe Avenue.\n\nThe bus swerved and caused four separate car accidents.\n\n4/20/2015 Related Story: Mid-Del Bus Driver Arrested For DUI After Crash In SE OKC\n\nInvestigators said it doesn't appear that Pitts was speeding.\n\n\"I looked at it again and said, \u2018Oh, I don't think somebody made it out of this one, that just looks too bad to me,'\" said Jessie Briggs, who lives near the crash site.\n\n\"When I came out, I saw the truck flip up, car up against the curb, and I had never seen anything on the street like this before.\"\n\nSeveral people were hurt. One person suffered a serious neck injury and another may have to have a hand amputated.\n\n\"I am amazed that we don't have more serious injuries, you take 8 o'clock in the morning on a school day, and you got a school bus driving down the street in that type of condition, and a school bus is a big vehicle and carries a lot of mass behind it,\" said Oklahoma City Police Lt. Rod Strecker.\n\nPolice said Pitts had some type of medical emergency before ultimately slamming into a railroad bridge, where they found him unconscious.\n\nDetectives also discovered drugs on the school bus. Pitts was arrested on complaints of Driving under the Influence and Leaving the Scene of an Injury Accident. He will stay in the hospital overnight before being booked into jail.\n\nThe Mid-Del School district said the bus was impounded by police, but it did have a surveillance camera. Pitts had been a Mid-Del bus driver since 2011.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Police said they are investigating a metro school bus driver after he crashed into multiple cars before slamming into a railroad bridge.", "author": "Heather Hope", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/28851553/police-investigate-mid-del-bus-driver-after-injury-crash", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/7514084_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Police said they are investigating a metro school bus driver after he crashed into multiple cars before slamming into a railroad bridge.", "title": "Police Investigate Mid-Del Bus Driver After Injury Crash"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/7514084_G.jpg", "description": "Police said they are investigating a metro school bus driver after he crashed into multiple cars before slamming into a railroad bridge.", "card": "summary", "title": "Police Investigate Mid-Del Bus Driver After Injury Crash"}, "wnreadableurl": "police-investigate-mid-del-bus-driver-after-injury-crash", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2015/04/20", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,news9.com, news 9, kwtv, Car Crash", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS20", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,news9.com, news 9, kwtv, Car Crash"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe5c\"", "article_summary": "4/20/2015 Related Story: Mid-Del Bus Driver Arrested For DUI After Crash In SE OKCInvestigators said it doesn't appear that Pitts was speeding.\nPolice said they are investigating a metro school bus driver after he crashed into multiple cars before slamming into a railroad bridge.\nPitts had been a Mid-Del bus driver since 2011.\nThe Mid-Del School district said the bus was impounded by police, but it did have a surveillance camera.\nPolice said 58-year-old Mid-Del Schools bus driver Odis Pitts, who was on his way to pick up students, weaved in and out of traffic along S.E."}
