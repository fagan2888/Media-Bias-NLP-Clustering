Chris McDaniel over incumbent Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS) Monday, saying the race is \u201ctoo important\u201d and McDaniel is \u201ctoo good\u201d a candidate not to.\n\nNoting, \u201cI mostly stay out of primaries,\u201d Hannity explained his support was rooted in distaste for Washington deal making as he indirectly compared McDaniel to Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very frustrating to me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just is. Do we want to change the country for the better? If we want to do that, we need bold, outspoken, dynamic, inspiring leadership\u2013people that are willing to take a stand. Ted Cruz is willing to take a stand. Ted Cruz is fighting the administration. Ted Cruz goes out there and does what every Republican said they\u2019d do on healthcare and he gets trashed by his fellow senators for doing what they themselves promised to do. I don\u2019t understand it. I really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI kind of feel awkward telling people in Mississippi who to vote for, but I\u2019ve been asked, and I\u2019m giving you the answer: People ask me who I would vote for, and I would vote for Sen. Chris McDaniel,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cThat\u2019s my answer.\u201d\n\nMcDaniel and Cochran represent the latest battleground in the larger clash between the Tea Party and the GOP Establishment. Their contest will be resolved in a runoff election roughly two weeks from now. McDaniel narrowly defeated Cochran in the June 3 primary.\n\nMcDaniel, who is leading in two new polls, is generally considered the frontrunner because he won the first round of balloting, brings a youthful vigor to the race that Cochran at 76 lacks, and generally enjoys more enthusiastic support.\n\nThe first poll, a Chism Strategies poll, found McDaniel leads Cochran 50.6 percent to 47.6 percent, just inside the poll\u2019s 3.3 percent margin of error. The second poll from the Strategic Journal, according to Politico\u2018s Morning Score, shows McDaniel with a six-point lead, 52 percent to Cochran\u2019s 46 percent.\n\nCochran\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, is working to reach out to Mississippi\u2019s Democratic voters, many of whom are eligible to vote in the runoff. In an interview with WAPT television, Cochran said that McDaniel\u2019s campaign beat his in turning out voters on election day\u2013something he plans to counter on June 24.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re from Yazoo City or the Coast, or if you are white or black,\u201d Henry Barbour, the head of pro-Cochran Super PAC Mississippi Conservatives told The New York Times. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make certain that everybody knows they have a stake in this, and the state needs somebody to represent the interest of all three million Mississippians.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by Politico if Cochran would seek non-Republican voters for help in the GOP primary runoff, Cochran supporter state Sen. Lydia Chassaniol hit the tone of the message: \u201cI think that three million Mississippians and everyone who cares about the state ought to take a real hard look at this.\u201d\n\nTo Republicans, top Cochran allies are making the case that a McDaniel victory in the primary could put the senate seat in jeopardy in the general election. \u201cI do think if Chris McDaniel is our nominee, the Democrats have a chance,\u201d Henry Barbour said in an appearance on MSNBC this weekend.\n\n\u201cThe only way to be certain that Republicans retain the seat is to nominate Senator Cochran,\u201d Rep. Gregg Harper (R-MS), a key Cochran ally, told Breitbart News on Monday through a spokesman. Harper is at the top of the short list of Mississippi politicians who\u2019d be considered for an appointment into Cochran\u2019s seat should Cochran be re-elected and not serve out his full term, a former top staffer of Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS) says.\n\nCochran\u2019s campaign website and official Twitter account are filled with links to the argument that McDaniel\u2019s being the nominee could cost the GOP the Mississippi Senate seat, and the Senate majority as a whole depending on what else happens nationwide in November.\n\nHowever, the argument took a major blow Sunday when Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus dismissed it out of hand.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone with some minimal level of political sophistication actually believes that Mississippi is going to be somehow coming into play in November,\u201d Priebus said on ABC News\u2019s This Week With George Stephanopoulos this weekend.\n\nThe Club For Growth, a conservative group that\u2019s spent millions supporting McDaniel, seized on Priebus\u2019s comments to tout the race as a battle for the future direction of the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cThe Republican primary runoff in Mississippi isn\u2019t about control of the Senate, it\u2019s about what kind of Republican we should send to the Senate,\u201d said Chris Chocola, the Club For Growth\u2019s president.\n\nIn response, Brad Dayspring, a spokesman for the NRSC, which has been working to help Cochran, said, \u201cChairman Priebus is right on; a Republican will win the Mississippi Senate race. That Republican will be Thad Cochran.\u201d\n\nThe Rothenberg Political Report ranks Mississippi \u201cSafe Republican.\u201d The Cook Political report rates the state \u201cLikely Republican\u201d at R+9.\n\nNonetheless, Cochran\u2019s campaign points to comments Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid made at a fundraiser for Alison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic challenger to Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. According to audio obtained by Politico, Reid said that Childers had a chance to win there.\n\n\u201cYou watch Mississippi,\u201d Reid said. \u201cTravis Childers, Congressman Childers\u2013I think everyone\u2019s pulling for McDaniel, but it doesn\u2019t matter\u2013I think you will see a big surprise there from Congressman Childers.\u201d\n\nCochran spokesman Jordan Russell said in a statement that the Reid comments \u201cconfirm that Democrats are hoping Chris McDaniel wins the runoff\u201d so the Democrats have a chance in November.\n\nHowever, The New York Times\u2018s Nate Cohn conducted an analysis of the actual statistics and numbers of the race and concluded that the \u201cDemocrats Shouldn\u2019t Dream In Mississippi.\u201d After walking through his analysis, Cohn argued that even the long-shot of a tiny Republican turnout doesn\u2019t give Childers a chance in November.\n\n\u201cMr. Childers would probably need a historic drop-off in Republican turnout, allowing black voters to rise to a larger share of the electorate than in 2012,\u201d Cohn wrote. \u201cThen Mr. Childers would need to run a flawless campaign and cross his fingers. Because even then he might not have a pathway to victory.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fox News host and national conservative radio personality Sean Hannity endorsed state Sen.
