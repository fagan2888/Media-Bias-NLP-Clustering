And by Wednesday evening, the most buzzed about piece of reporting on the matter was Ken Auletta\u2019s New Yorker take, and in particular, a \u201cclose associate\u2019s\u201d assertion that when Abramson learned she had been paid less than her predecessor Bill Keller, \u201cShe confronted the top brass\u201d in a move that furthered management\u2019s narrative that she was \u201cpushy.\u201d\n\nThe pay issue is a deeply contentious one, especially in a year in which the wage gap has been a major news story, including \u2014 irony alert! \u2014 in the pages of the New York Times itself. That the paper might have been reporting on pay inequity while simultaneously engaging in it seems simultaneously demoralizing yet not surprising. Women earn less than their male counterparts across the board, so who\u2019d be so naive to assume it wouldn\u2019t happen in the media? The bigger issue is whether a salary dispute was a punitive gesture at the heart of the shakeup. NPR media reporter David Folkenflik noted yesterday said that he\u2019d \u201cindependently confirmed that Abramson did indeed challenge corporate brass over what she saw as equal pay,\u201d while New York Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy cryptically told Business Insider that \u201cJill\u2019s total compensation as executive editor was not meaningfully less than Bill Keller\u2019s,\u201d without explaining what constitutes \u201cmeaningful.\u201d\n\nBut what if this was a personality issue, and if so, was Abramson\u2019s gender a factor? Abramson has long been widely described in unflattering \u2014 and vaguely sexist \u2014 terms. She\u2019s been called difficult, \u201cbrusque to the point of rudeness\u201d and \u201cstubborn and condescending.\u201d A year ago, Politico reported that \u201cEvery editor has a story about how she\u2019s blown up in a meeting.\u201d Her successor, by the way, is Dean Baquet, a man who in an incident last year \u201cslammed his hand against a wall and stormed out of the newsroom\u201d \u2013 so let\u2019s see if he, too, quickly earns a rep as \u201cbrusque\u201d and \u201cstubborn.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A single adjective shows how workplace sexism is alive and well", "title": "Don\u2019t call Jill Abramson \u201cpushy\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A single adjective shows how workplace sexism is alive and well", "title": "Don\u2019t call Jill Abramson \u201cpushy\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/15/dont_call_jill_abramson_pushy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/jill_abramson.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A single adjective shows how workplace sexism is alive and well", "title": "Don\u2019t call Jill Abramson \u201cpushy\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/jill_abramson.jpg", "creator": "@embeedub", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Bill Keller, Jill Abramson, Media Criticism, New York Times, Sexism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd37d\"", "article_summary": "\u2014 in the pages of the New York Times itself.\nTopics: Bill Keller, Jill Abramson, Media Criticism, New York Times, Sexism, Life NewsWhen the New York Times abruptly announced Wednesday afternoon that editor Jill Abramson was out \u2013 and offered the remarkably tight-lipped explanation that it was due to \u201can issue with management in the newsroom\u201d \u2013 the mediasphere couldn\u2019t scramble fast enough to get to the root of the tumult.\nThat the paper might have been reporting on pay inequity while simultaneously engaging in it seems simultaneously demoralizing yet not surprising.\nAbramson has long been widely described in unflattering \u2014 and vaguely sexist \u2014 terms.\nThe bigger issue is whether a salary dispute was a punitive gesture at the heart of the shakeup."}
