SRINAGAR, India (AP) — Officials say two Indian policemen have been arrested in the killing of a teenager during weekend protests in the disputed region of Kashmir.

After two days of clashes between Indian law enforcement authorities and anti-India demonstrators, towns across the Himalayan territory were mostly quiet on Sunday.

Police said in a statement that they arrested two policemen after a preliminary investigation revealed one had ordered the other to fire his rifle at protesters Saturday “in violation of laid down SOP (standard operating procedure).”

Indian authorities have been struggling to contain growing anger after Friday’s arrest of a separatist leader on charges of leading protests against India’s rule in the region.

Streets in the main city of Srinagar were tense Sunday, with armed police and paramilitary soldiers inspecting vehicles and questioning people.
