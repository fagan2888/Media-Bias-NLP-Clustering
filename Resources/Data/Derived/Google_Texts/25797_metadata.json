Associated Press\n\nNEW ORLEANS -- The Latest on the shooting death of ex-NFL player Will Smith (all times local):\n\n6 p.m.\n\nA New Orleans magistrate has set bond at $1 million for the man accused of killing former New Orleans Saints player Will Smith. Magistrate Brigid Collins noted that Smith was shot in the back and side.\n\nDefense attorney John Fuller said after Sunday's hearing that 28-year-old Cardell Hayes is not guilty of the second-degree murder charge on which he's being held.\n\nHe implied that Hayes fired because he believed Smith was going for a gun of his own.\n\nFuller says the accident that police said touched off the shooting was the second within moments. He says a hit-and-run driver had just run into the back of Hayes' Hummer, and Hayes had called 911 and was following the other vehicle to get its license plate number.\n\nFuller won't say whether Hayes identifies Smith's Mercedes as the vehicle that hit the Hummer.\n\n___\n\n3:30 p.m.\n\nThe New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame says defensive end Will Smith had been unanimously voted into the hall last month.\n\nHall of Fame President Ken Trahan (TRAY-han) says the announcement had been scheduled next month.

He says he doesn't want to say anything that might compromise the police investigation or weaken the case against Hayes.\n\nHe says Hayes shot Smith and Smith's wife during an argument after Hayes' Hummer rear-ended Smith's Mercedes about 11:30 p.m. Saturday.\n\nHarrison says Smith's wife was shot once in the leg.\n\n___\n\n2:15 p.m.\n\nNew Orleans' police chief confirms that people who dined Saturday night with former New Orleans Saints Will Smith included a former officer who had been sued by the man accused of killing Smith.\n\nBut Superintendent Michael Harrison says he cannot say whether that played any part in the crash and shooting.

Police settled the lawsuit in 2011.\n\nAttorney Ike Spears, who represented Hayes, says the settlement was confidential.\n\n___\n\n1:20 p.m.\n\nThe man accused of killing former New Orleans Saints defensive end Will Smith had once sued city police after they shot and killed his father on Dec. 26, 2005.\n\nCardell Hayes, 28, and the city settled the federal lawsuit in September 2011, while attorneys were preparing for trial in the case. Court papers don't describe the settlement.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, several people told the officers that Antonio Hayes had a history of mental illness.\n\nPolice said they shot Antonio Hayes after he lunged at them with a 3-inch-long knife. Bystanders had video of officers surrounding Hayes, but not of the shooting. Six officers were defendants in the lawsuit, which said Anthony Hayes was shot at least nine times.\n\nCardell Hayes was arrested and charged with second-degree murder in the death of Smith, who was shot and killed Saturday after a traffic accident.\n\n___\n\n10:45 a.m.\n\nThe New Orleans Saints have released a statement following the death of former defensive end Will Smith, who was shot and killed late Saturday in New Orleans.\n\nExecutive Vice President and General Manager Mickey Loomis says that the entire organization is deeply saddened by Smith's death and noted that he was \"an important contributor to numerous charitable causes\" and a \"cornerstone\" of the team that won the Super Bowl in 2009.\n\nAmong Smith's charitable causes was the Smith Family Christmas event that provided 60 needy families with holiday meals, gifts and a behind-the-scenes tour of the club's practice facilities.\n\nA suspect has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder.
