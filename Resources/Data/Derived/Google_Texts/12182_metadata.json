The administration has had to scramble to make fixes in the hopes enough Americans sign up by deadlines in December and March.\n\nBoth Verizon and HP declined comment on the contract change, as did the White House, which referred questions about the contract to CMS.\n\nCMS said its contract with Terremark had been set to end in March 2014. Last summer, several months before the botched October 1 launch of HealthCare.gov, the agency issued a \"task order\" asking for bids. HP was awarded that contract, a CMS spokesman said in a statement.\n\nThe contract change was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nNow, CMS needs to transition its data center to HP at a time when it is just beginning to dig out from a mountain of problems with the website, which is designed to let consumers shop for health insurance required under Obama's signature health care law.\n\nThe complexity of the switch between data center providers could be an additional challenge for the project. A CMS spokesman did not respond to questions about whether the transition would affect the website.\n\nThe Obama administration has said it plans to have the website working smoothly for most users by this weekend.\n\nPart of that upgrade involves doubling capacity so the website can handle 50,000 users at once.\n\nA source close to the project, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there are some concerns about the website's ability to handle so many users because of problems with switches and servers maintained by Terremark.\n\n\"CMS has begun the necessary activities to transition the data center over to HP. We are working to ensure a smooth transition between the two contractors,\" the CMS spokesman said in a statement.\n\nVerizon has received $55.4 million for its work on the healthcare marketplaces since its contract started in 2011, according to federal contracting records.\n\n(Additional reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Christopher Wilson and Lisa Shumaker)", "article_metadata":
