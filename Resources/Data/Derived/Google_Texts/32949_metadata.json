Although Abu-Bakr notified the district that his religious beliefs prevented him from cutting his beard, he was reprimanded and told that \u201cfurther disciplinary action\u201d would result if he didn\u2019t trim his facial hair.\n\nPhilly.com reported:\n\nThe lawsuit claims the district failed to consider Abu-Bakr\u2019s request for \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d to its grooming policy. The district instead denied the request without showing that complying would cause undue hardship, according to the suit. Prosecutors said Abu-Bakr filed a religious discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which referred the matter to the Justice Department after determining there was reasonable cause to support the allegation. Through the suit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the United States is seeking that the district be required to create new grooming policies that don\u2019t discriminate against employees. The lawsuit is also seeking monetary damages for Abu-Bakr and others who are similarly situated.\n\n\u201cNo employee should be forced to violate his religious beliefs in order to earn a living,\u201d Spencer Lewis Jr., district director of the EEOC\u2019s Philadelphia District Office, said in a statement. \u201cModifying a dress or grooming code is a reasonable accommodation that enables employees to keep working without posing an undue hardship on the employer.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department continues to challenge the Little Sisters of the Poor\u2019s claim that Obamacare\u2019s contraception mandate violates its own religious beliefs. The U.S. Supreme Court granted the Catholic nuns a temporary exemption in January while the issue is litigated in the lower courts.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "The Department of Justice filed a civil rights lawsuit accusing a Pennsylvania school district of violating a Muslim employee\u2019s religious freedom by requiring him to comply with its grooming standards.
