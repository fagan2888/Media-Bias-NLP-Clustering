A Texas car dealer has pleaded guilty to federal wire fraud charges for deliberately wrecking his rare, $1 million Bugatti automobile in order to collect more than $2 million in insurance money.

Andy Lee House, 39, faces up to 20 years in federal prison for destroying his Bugatti Veyron, an Italian supercar capable of reaching 250 mph and powered by a W16 cylinder engine, the equivalent two narrow-angle V8 engines.

House purchased a 2006 Bugatti Veyron for $1 million and had it insured for $2.2 million. On Nov. 11, 2009, House drove the vehicle into the Gulf Bay near La Marque, Texas, and upon exiting the Bugatti, left the motor running, resulting in the engine taking on large amounts of salt water which destroyed the vehicle.

House said he was reaching for his cell phone and was startled by a “low-flying pelican,” causing him to swerve and accidentally drive into the bay.

House reported the loss to Philadelphia Indemnity Insurance Co., and tried to collect on the $2.2 million policy he had taken out on the Bugatti.

What House did not know was that a motorist had used his cellphone to record the fast-moving car, and posted its crash on YouTube.

The video showed no pelicans in the air that day.
