Lawyer.com hosted its Summer Olympics, an event held annually since 2012, on Wednesday, Aug. 12, at Harry Dunham Park in the Basking Ridge section of Bernards. The event is a chance to unite and engage employees through friendly competition. From giant Jenga to the javelin, there was no shortage of fun.

Lawyer.com CEO Gerry Gorman says the event is a good example of the company's energetic culture at Lawyer.com.

"Eighty-five percent of our employees at Lawyer.com are millennials," Gorman said. "Events like the Lawyer.com Summer Olympics are an important way to keep these young workers engaged, excited and productive."

According to the Pew Research Center, 1 in 3 American workers are millennials, making up the largest generation in the U.S. labor force. As more millennials join the work force, companies need to accommodate their unique personalities and work ethic. One way to do this is by offering fun, interactive and collaborative work places. Lawyer.com is a pioneer in the way modern companies are adjusting to the influx of millennial workers.
