Earlier this week Palestinian-American Mohamad Jamal Khweis turned himself into Kurdish forces in Iraq after leaving his home in Virginia to join the Islamic State. Kweis says he joined ISIS after falling in love with a woman affiliated with the organization.

After witnessing the atrocities carried out by ISIS, Khweis says he made a mistake and wants to come home to America.

I'm sure prison awaits should he choose to come back.
