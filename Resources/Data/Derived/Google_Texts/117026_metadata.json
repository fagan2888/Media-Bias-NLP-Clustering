But that moment may be fleeting. Hillary Clinton \u2014 who does not share Sanders\u2019 Scandinavian obsession \u2014 is the Democrats\u2019 almost certain presidential nominee.\n\nBut more importantly, a different political ideology is emerging within the party. And this one comes from Silicon Valley, not Sweden or Denmark.\n\nHere\u2019s technology journalist Greg Ferenstein, who\u2019s conducted research on this growing movement:\n\nInternet startup founders represent an entirely distinct, libertarian-like ideology within the Democratic Party. Tech startup founders see the government as an investor in citizens, rather than as a protector from capitalism. Founders share all the stereotypical fervor for the free market as libertarians, but they also believe the government has a duty to actively help citizens solve global problems. \u2026 Technologists want the government to be an investor in citizens, rather than as a protector from capitalism. They want the government to heavily fund education, encourage more active citizenship, pursue binding international trade alliances, and open borders to all immigrants. It combines the meritocracy obsession of libertarians with the collectivism of liberals. [Greg Ferenstein]\n\nThese are Democrats \u2014 startup founders and tech workers alike gave overwhelmingly to Barack Obama and support ObamaCare. But they are Democrats whose particular politics derive from their experience as technologists. They are super-rich super-optimists with great faith in the power of information, employed by meritocracies working together, to solve problems. \u201cThey believe that all problems are information problems,\u201d Ferenstein writes. Or, as he quotes Alphabet\u2019s (formerly Google\u2019s) Eric Schmidt, \u201c\u2026 if you take a large number of people and empower them with communication tools and opportunities to be created, society gets better.\u201d As a result, tech Democrats embrace change as a powerful force for good.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just techies. Ferenstein argues that these beliefs are shared by college-educated Dems in high-skill industries and independent contractors in the \u201cgig economy.\u201d Combining the fabulous wealth of Silicon Valley with the alliance of these two sets of workers could result in a Democratic Party where the populist Sanders-Warren wing is in the minority. I\u2019ve called this conflict the Innovation Democrats vs. the Inequality Democrats. Ferenstein calls it the Civicrats (\u201cGoal is to make everyone as innovative, healthy, civic, and educated as possible\u201d) vs. the Protectocrats (\u201cGoal is fairness and equality\u201d).\n\nBut you could also call this new breed of Silicon Valley\u2013inspired folks the Unicorn Democrats.\n\nNow, the Unicorn Democrats\u2019 eventual dominance over the Democratic Party is not as certain as Ferenstein concludes. Nor is it certain that this emerging Unicorn faction will even belong to the Dems in the long term. Ferenstein\u2019s own survey shows tech workers split evenly between Sanders and Clinton, although gig economy workers are more clearly pro-Hillary. And center-left economist Robert Atkinson writes in the Washington Monthly that \u201ca growing number of progressives in the last few years have become decidedly ambivalent, if not downright hostile, toward the idea of increasing productivity, seeing it as a threat to progressive goals of full employment, fairness, and stability.\u201d Call them progressives against technological progress.\n\nCould there be a place for the techno-optimists in the GOP? Maybe\u2026 but only if the Democrats decide to go the full IKEAmerica.\n\nAfter all, there is significant crossover between Republicans and Civicrats on many domestic policy issues \u2014 think charter schools, free trade, the sharing economy, and deregulation. But social issues and foreign policy, not so much.\n\nNow, if Republicans lose their third straight presidential election next November, modernizing the party\u2019s moldy agenda may create a safe space for some Civicrat-friendly ideas on the right, such as increased public investment in science and infrastructure. Or, in the spirit of disruptive innovation, a new party could emerge between the big-government social democratic Dems and the micro-government tea party GOP.\n\nThen we\u2019ll have the donkey, the elephant, and the unicorn.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Democratic Party is having its democratic socialist moment, thanks to the insurgent candidacy of Bernie Sanders.
