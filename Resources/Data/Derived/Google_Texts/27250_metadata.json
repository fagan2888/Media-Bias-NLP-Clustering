If they agree, their data will be retained to help the DOH remain in contact and make sure they receive \u201cspecialized, ongoing care for their illness\u201d at area mental-health clinics, the agency said.\n\n\u201cThe first-episode psychosis initiative will help young adults developing schizophrenia and related illnesses receive high-quality care as soon as they are diagnosed, because new research shows that treating these conditions early can help patients improve significantly,\u201d the DOH told The Post. \u201cThis initiative is part of a broader effort to improve our fragmented mental-health treatment system.\u201d\n\nThe agency said patients need not fret over privacy.\n\n\u201cWe are very sensitive to confidentiality. Part of the provision of this proposal is that the reported information to us will be deleted \u00adafter 30 days, and we think that is an important component to address concerns,\u201d a spokesman said.\n\nIn the past year, mentally ill individuals were behind the country\u2019s bloodiest tragedies. Aaron Alexis shot 12 people dead last month at the DC Navy Yard, and Adam Lanza gunned down 26 kids and staffers at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn.\n\nAnd on Oct. 3, Miriam Carey, a 34-year-old Connecticut woman suffering from mental illness, was shot dead by police after she tried to ram a barricade at the White House.\n\nBut the city said those incidents did not spur its initiative.\n\n\u201cViolence involving individuals with serious mental illness is tragic but uncommon,\u201d a DOH spokeswoman said. \u201cIf people with mental illness receive more consistent care, it should reduce the suffering that they experience as well as the risk of violence.\u201d\n\nThe DOH estimated that about 60,000 New Yorkers suffer from psychotic illnesses, with about 2,000 new cases expected to develop each year.\n\nOnly about half of those people receive ongoing psychiatric care after they\u2019re discharged from a hospital, the agency said.\n\nThe initiative would take effect if the Board of Health approves an amendment to the city\u2019s Health Code. The matter will receive a public hearing Oct. 22 at the agency\u2019s Long Island City, Queens, headquarters and will come to a vote in December.\n\nMental-health experts saluted the city\u2019s effort.\n\n\u201cThey are trying to understand the number of people involved and develop effective treatments to prevent further problems,\u201d said Kenn Dudek, president of Fountain House, a Hell\u2019s Kitchen-based community mental-health program. \u201cI do believe strongly that some form of early intervention will be a very good thing.\u201d\n\nBut some think the city must do more.\n\n\u201cThe city policy is good, but it should be extended to high-risk categories \u2014 those mentally ill involuntarily treated or discharged from jails,\u201d said DJ Jaffe, executive director of the Mental Illness Policy Organization. \u201cThe big problems are those who have had multiple entries or already been dangerous or committed crimes.
