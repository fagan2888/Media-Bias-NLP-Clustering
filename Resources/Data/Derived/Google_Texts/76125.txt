As Scott Walker tries to ingratiate himself with the Koch brothers and their attack on the American middle class, Minnesota's governor, Mark Dayton, has tried a different approach to boosting his state's economy.

While our governor wants to make it harder to vote, easier to attack unions, and undermine the entire UW System, Minnesota, under Dayton, has done just the opposite.

They have increased the minimum wage, boosted primary education funding, and passed laws requiring equal pay for women. To pay for these programs, Dayton called for an increase on taxes for the wealthiest 2 percent. Minnesota Republicans howled and predicted businesses and jobs would leave the state in droves. Not only has that not happened, but Minnesota's economy is booming.

Two years after the tax hike, Minnesota's unemployment rate is among the lowest in the country at 3.6 percent. Their GDP growth rate is also one of the best. Their median incomes are $8,000 higher than the national average.

What's working in Minnesota could work here, too. But our governor's more concerned about voter fraud, welfare abuse and other non-issues, as opposed to the shrinking middle class. How long will it be before people start asking, "What's the matter with Wisconsin?"
