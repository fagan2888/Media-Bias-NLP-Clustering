He found not only that every school not have a chess program, but also that the Ferguson-Florissant school district had previously expressed interest in creating one.\n\nRagone took the idea for creating a program to Ascension\u2019s CEO, Dr. Anthony Tersigni, who quickly jumped on board. Within 48 hours of Ragone\u2019s initial conversation with his son, a program that will benefit over 400 children in the St. Louis, Mo. area this fall was born. (This paragraph orignally misidentified the Ascension CEO as Robert Henkel.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a longtime goal of ours to bring after-school chess clubs to all the schools in our district,\u201d Joseph Davis, superintendent of the district, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrific opportunity to instill confidence in our children and provide them with lifelong skills that will enable future successes.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, students, faculty, and three chess grandmasters\u2014the highest title for a chess player\u2014gathered in the library at Walnut Grove Elementary in Ferguson, Mo., to announce the partnership between Ascension and the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of St. Louis, who will offer the chess club.\n\nMaurice Ashley, the first and only African-American chess grandmaster, was on hand for the press conference.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to encourage kids to take part in such a positive, empowering activity,\u201d Ashley said.\n\nAshley, along with the two other chess grandmasters, spent the day teaching students how to play the game.\n\n\u201cThe kids absolutely ate it up and loved it and were so engaged,\u201d Ragone said. \u201cThis is the single coolest day of my professional working life that I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nThe chess club will run for 10 weeks this fall, meeting once per week. Ascension will fund the program, removing a cost that could have deterred schools, parents, and children from involvement in the extracurricular activity. A certified chess instructor will lead the meetings.\n\n\u201cWe think it\u2019s a pretty unique partnership with public, private, and nonprofit [organizations] to do something really, really special for kids in this area,\u201d Ragone says, adding that including chess in school curricula will help students with math and reading skills, as well as strategic planning and decision-making. Indeed, research has shown that playing chess has been linked to academic achievement.\n\n\u201c[Chess] reinforces logical thinking, discipline, attention to detail, strategic planning and complex problem solving,\u201d said Tony Rich, executive director of the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of Saint Louis, in a press statement. \u201cWe know that children who learn chess tend to perform better at school, and it\u2019s a game they can play for the rest of their lives.\u201d\n\nRagone says the chess program will be monitored to see if participants improve in academics or other areas such as patience and discipline. It is his hope that the program will ultimately expand to other cities. Ideally, he would like other businesses to get involved in similar partnerships.\n\n\u201cHopefully it will create a lifelong love of chess and a love of learning,\u201d Ragone said. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of the program. We\u2019re hoping it goes really well and that we expand it to every school district in the St. Louis area.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An after-school chess program for 20 elementary and middle schools launched this fall in the Ferguson-Florissant school district.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An after-school chess program for 20 elementary and middle schools launched this fall in the Ferguson-Florissant school district.", "title": "Nonprofit Executive Brings Chess Program to St. Louis Schools", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Pic-2.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-16T23:06:24+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1ND8bwL"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An after-school chess program for 20 elementary and middle schools launched this fall in the Ferguson-Florissant school district.", "title": "Nonprofit Executive Brings Chess Program to St. Louis Schools", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Pic-2.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12", "published_time": "2015-09-16T17:49:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-16T23:06:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ferguson, St. Louis, Ascension, Nick Ragone, Chess Club, school,"}, "article_summary": "The boy then asked if all the schools in St. Louis offered chess to their students.\nWe\u2019re hoping it goes really well and that we expand it to every school district in the St. Louis area.\u201d\nNot knowing the answer, Ragone looked into chess in St. Louis the next day.\nHe found not only that every school not have a chess program, but also that the Ferguson-Florissant school district had previously expressed interest in creating one.\nWithin 48 hours of Ragone\u2019s initial conversation with his son, a program that will benefit over 400 children in the St. Louis, Mo."}
