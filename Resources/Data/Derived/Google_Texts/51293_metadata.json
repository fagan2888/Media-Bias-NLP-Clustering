It was during this period of transition that single- and multi-specialty management companies like Sheridan and TeamHealth emerged as key players in the industry, providing health systems the resources, economies of scale, and subspecialty access they needed. Thus began a trend of aggressive consolidation throughout the industry, as more and more independent physician practices were unable to keep up with rising demands, costs, and decreasing reimbursements.\n\nIn fact, just this past year, medical management consultancy ProCare Systems released a report titled \u201cThreats to Independence and Implications for the Future\u201d which found that 71 percent of surveyed physicians reported that changes in healthcare regulatory, compliance and government policy landscape significantly affect their future as an independent physician.\n\nWhile M&A activity largely began in specialties other than radiology, such as anesthesia and emergency medicine, radiology has gradually become a target for national management companies as an additional service line to offer.\n\nIn the last year alone, two large, radiology-specific national management companies were acquired by multi-specialty giants, leaving independent practices to wonder, \u201cWill I be next?\u201d Sheridan\u2019s acquisition of Radisphere in January 2015, combined with Mednax\u2019s acquisition of vRad in May, changed the tone of the conversation to one of urgency for independent radiology groups across the country.\n\nBut this contradicts physicians\u2019 preference to remain autonomous, especially when it comes to clinical operations. According to a 2013 RAND study for the American Medical Association, physicians reported greater rates of satisfaction when they maintained control over clinical operations and the selection of colleagues and coworkers. The study, titled \u201cFactors Affecting Physician Professional Satisfaction and Their Implications for Patient Care, Health Systems, and Health Policy,\u201d also reflected the growing pressure on physician leaders in this era of change. Nearly half of the surveyed doctors reported their jobs felt \u201cextremely stressful,\u201d and more than a quarter reported experiencing chronic symptoms of burnout or feeling \u201ccompletely burned out.\u201d\n\nUltimately, in the dynamic and rapidly changing post-ACA world, independent physician leaders have three options:\n\n1. Collaborate with others and remain independent;\n\n2. Sell or merge their practice to a management company or larger practice; or\n\n3. Sell their practice to a hospital.\n\nProCare Systems\u2019 2015 report found that, though 73 percent of surveyed physicians would like to remain independent in the coming years, 44 percent said they were likely to sell their practice in the next decade due to escalating costs and shrinking reimbursements assuming no other alternatives.\n\nAnd yet, half of the survey respondents reported an interest in joining an independent practice association to provide the scale and negotiating power necessary to thrive in the post-ACA landscape.\n\nThis is the first option from the above list, which allows groups the ability to collaborate and avoid the loss of independence experienced by so many other groups and specialties in the industry.\n\nAn example of this alternative is aRegional Radiology Group Network (RRGN) model, which brings together independent radiology groups not in a merger, but in a joint venture through which practices maintain autonomy but achieve the resources and scale they need to survive. Groups also experience significant cost-savings on items such as medical malpractice insurance, as well as an advanced data and analytics package that helps improve operational efficiency and clinical results.\n\nThe success of this model can be seen through Empire Health Support Services, an RRGN located in New York\u2019s Hudson Valley. This network is the result of a partnership between Radiologic Associates, P.C. andRamapo Radiology Associates in 2014, and has already succeeded in cutting costs and strengthening the operational capacity for the two groups.\n\n\u201cGiven the many changes in radiology, it has already been beneficial to work with other like-minded groups rather than compete with them,\u201d said Radiologic Associates\u2019 president Joseph Racanelli, M.D.\n\nRadiologic Associates CEO Andrew Mazzella echoed the advantages of this collaborative model to not only the groups themselves, but also the local health systems they serve.\n\n\u201cThe benefits to the hospital systems served are an increase in subspecialty access, a better skill set for overnight coverage, and an ability to access a broad and deep informatics pool to drive both efficiency and quality across the spectrum of care,\u201d Mazzella said.\n\nWhile the past five or so years have been a chaotic and rapidly evolving time for the healthcare industry, it is difficult to imagine the chaos stopping or even slowing down anytime soon. And though radiology operated in a steady milieu for decades, it is undeniable that big changes will continue to come to the specialty.\n\nTo find out more about this collaborative model and how your practice can remain independent, please contact Integrated Radiology Partners at ContactIRP@IntegratedRP.com.\n\nMore articles on physicians:\n\n11 things to know about physician independence and employment\n\n9 states with the highest & lowest physician salaries\n\nDevelop great payer strategies in 2016: 5 key notes for ASCs\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Copyright ASC COMMUNICATIONS 2016.
