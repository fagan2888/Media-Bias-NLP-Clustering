It\u2019s centers on the plight of a woman from Lawrenceburg, Tenn. whose $57-a-month plan was canceled because it didn\u2019t meet the standards of the new law, thus \"forcing\" her into a $373-a-month Platinum plan purchased through HealthCare.gov.\n\nThe woman, Emilie Lamb, 39, was so outraged that she told her story in this video from Americans for Prosperity and again in this op-ed from the New York Post. And she was a guest of her Congresswoman, Marsha Blackburn, at the State of the Union Address last month. (Blackburn\u2019s office was kind enough to pass along to Lamb my request to speak to her, but I never heard from her.)\n\nLamb suffers from lupus, a chronic inflammatory autoimmune illness that requires lifelong monitoring and treatment. Her old plan, she wrote,\u201cwas perfect for someone with my unique medical condition and limited financial means.\u201d But the experts I spoke with say Lamb is lucky she didn\u2019t land in bankruptcy court before her old health plan was consigned to well-deserved oblivion. Here\u2019s why.\n\nHer old health plan, CoverTN, may have been a well-intentioned effort by the state of Tennesee to provide minimal coverage for lower-income working people. But the most it would pay out for health care in a single year was $25,000. That\u2019s barely enough for an uncomplicated pregnancy, and totally inadequate for a serious, unpredictable illness such as lupus that can require expensive treatments.\n\n\u201cLupus is a highly variable disease,\u201d Gary Gilkeson, M.D., a professor of medicine and lupus specialist at the Medical University of South Carolina, said. \u201cThere certainly are patients that do well on low-cost generic medications, but about 50 or 60 percent will end up needing immunosuppressants.\u201d If lower-cost varieties don\u2019t work, he said, \u201cthey go on to the biologics like Benlysta, which is around $50,000 a year, or Rituxan, which is about $60,000 a year.\u201d\n\nIn addition, having lupus greatly increases a person\u2019s risk of developing cancer, kidney failure, or heart disease, all of which can have six-figure treatment costs\u2014well above the $25,000 limit of Lamb's old plan. Luckily, Lamb hasn't yet needed any of these expensive drugs or treatments. But there's a very good chance that she will.\n\nUnder her old plan, they would not have been covered. Under her new plan, they will be. I used HealthCare.gov\u2019s window-shopping feature to identify what she purchased: a Platinum plan with a $1,500 out-of-pocket limit. (Here\u2019s the Summary of Benefits and Coverage for it.) There is no deductible, 25 percent coinsurance for pretty much all services, and, most critically, no upper limit on what the plan will pay out for medical care. So if she ever has a complication of her disease, or needs one of those expensive drugs, the most she\u2019ll have to pay out of pocket in a year is $1,500. The insurance company will pick up the rest of the tab, no matter how costly.\n\n\n\nIn other words, she now has real health insurance, not junk. The only \"horror story\" here was the insurance she used to have.\n\nAnd remember, before the new health law went into effect, having a serious pre-existing condition such as lupus would have made it impossible for Lamb to be accepted for private health insurance at any price. But when she went to buy her new plan, she wasn\u2019t asked a single question about her health history, because it is now officially a non-issue.\n\nGot a question for our health insurance expert?
