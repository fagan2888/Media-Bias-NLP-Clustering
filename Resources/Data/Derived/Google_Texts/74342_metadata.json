Here's how it opens:\n\n\"Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter\u201d is a sad and lonely movie about a sad and lonely woman who embarks on an impossible quest for something that cannot possibly be real.\n\nIt\u2019s a slight, often mysterious movie about dashed hopes and the difficulty of accepting life\u2019s cold realities. Even more than that, it\u2019s a movie about isolation and all the ways that a person can be cut off \u2014 or cut herself off \u2014 from the rest of the world.\n\nIn this case, that person is Kumiko, a 29-year-old \u201coffice lady\u201d at a nondescript workplace in Tokyo. She is surrounded by younger office ladies, all wearing the same outfits, all with smiles on their faces and laughter in their eyes.\n\nKumiko is different. She doesn\u2019t connect \u2014 even when others reach out.\n\nWhen an old colleague stops her on the street and tries to catch up, she shrinks in like a turtle. When her co-workers gab at a table, she separates herself from their conversations.\n\nDirector David Zellner, who co-wrote the movie with his brother, Nathan, emphasizes the social strangeness of these scenes, the awkwardness of being expected to respond to meaningless friendly banter. For Kumiko, being befriended is an alienating experience.\n\nWhen she is not at work, Kumiko fixates on a scene from a videotape she found buried near a beach \u2014 a ratty version of the Coen brothers\u2019 1996 crime movie, \u201cFargo.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "I reviewed the Zellner bros' indie festival hit, Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter, for today's Washington Times.
