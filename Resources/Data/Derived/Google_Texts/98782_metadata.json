Earlier reports from a local fire department had said there were three fatalities.\n\n\u201cIt came in real quick,\u201d Easterville volunteer firefighter Brittney Eder told the AP. \u201cThe sky turned jet black.\u201d\n\nAt 8:38 am, the National Weather Service tweeted out a tornado warning for the area. The twister hit the Cherrystone Campground, near Cape Charles, shortly before 9 am.\n\n\n\nWhile the weather incident can\u2019t be confirmed as a tornado until a storm survey team has assessed the campgrounds, NWS meteorologist Mike Rusnak says that based on the type of thunderstorm in the area and \u201cfrom the pictures we\u2019ve seen, we do think it was a tornado.\u201d\n\nJordan Bertok was on the campgrounds with her family at the time of the storm and has been tweeting pictures of the devastation. \u201cJust lived through a tornado,\u201d she wrote. \u201cChildren are missing. People are dead. Trees are down.\u201d Continuing with the message: \u201cThis is hell. I\u2019m in hell.\u201d\n\nBetrok\u2019s grandparents went in their car to take cover. They were hospitalized for injuries, although Betrok said that they are \u201cdoing well.\u201d\n\nLocal media outlet WAVY-TV reported that six ambulances and a mass casualty truck arrived on the scene to assist the injured and help transport them to the hospital. The news source also reports that some boats were flipped in Oyster Bay, although it\u2019s unknown whether they were occupied.", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "A local fire department confirmed that three people were killed when a tornado touched down at a Virginia campground Thursday morning", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Campers have been tweeting photos from the scene", "title": "Suspected Tornado Kills at Least 2 at Virginia Campground", "url": "http://time.com/3028679/tornado-cape-charles-virginia-campground/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/virginia-cape-charles-tornado-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/virginia-cape-charles-tornado-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "title": "Suspected Tornado Kills at Least 2 at Virginia Campground", "description": "Campers have been tweeting photos from the scene", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TIME"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "tornado, cape charles, virginia, dead", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "news_keywords": "Tornado, Cape Charles, Virginia, Dead"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd14e7\"", "article_summary": "Corinne Geller, a spokesperson for the Virginia Police Department, confirmed that the weather event had left two dead.\nThe twister hit the Cherrystone Campground, near Cape Charles, shortly before 9 am.\n\u201cThe sky turned jet black.\u201dAt 8:38 am, the National Weather Service tweeted out a tornado warning for the area.\nUpdate 12:11pmAt least two people were killed and 20 injured when a suspected tornado touched down at a Virginia campground Thursday morning, leaving overturned campers and injuries in its wake.\nThe news source also reports that some boats were flipped in Oyster Bay, although it\u2019s unknown whether they were occupied."}
