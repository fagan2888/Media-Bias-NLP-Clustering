Fiorina, who has surged in the polls since her well-received debate performance, presents herself as a candidate Republican women can get behind\u2014especially as Donald Trump increasingly alienates them. But if she made it to the White House, she would enact a conservative agenda that is bad for women and bad for families.\n\nFiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard CEO, is a dream come true to the GOP. In her, the party has found an antidote to Hillary Clinton: a conservative woman who scoffs at the very idea of \u201cwomen\u2019s issues,\u201d and who believes the war on women is nothing more than a false political narrative cooked up by Democrats. She took on Trump in the wake of his sexist attacks on Fox News' Megyn Kelly, a move that served her and her party well: It deflected attention from the candidates\u2019 anti-abortion debate remarks (such as Governor Scott Walker\u2019s refusal to say whether he supports an abortion-ban exception for mothers whose lives are at risk), and did damage to the unwelcome candidate dominating the GOP field.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that conservatives are embracing Fiorina. In 2012, the GOP lost the unmarried women\u2019s vote by 36 points; in the party\u2019s election post-mortem, strategists recommended that candidates use female spokespeople to better communicate the GOP\u2019s policies. They also advised making a better effort to listen to female voters, to push back against the Democratic \u201crhetoric against the 'so-called War on Women,'\" and to use Women\u2019s History Month to \u201cremind voters of the Republican\u2019s Party historical role in advancing the women\u2019s rights movement.\u201d But as we saw from the recent conservative excoriation of Planned Parenthood\u2014led in part by GOP Senator Joni Ernst and Congresswoman Diane Black\u2014the messengers look (a bit) different but the message is still the same.\n\nFiorina may be able to unite conservative women by hewing to the party line on social and economic issues, but she\u2019s unlikely to make inroads with low-income women, women of color, young women, and immigrant women. She is in favor of shutting down the government in order to defund Planned Parenthood. She is opposed to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and to the law\u2019s provision that guarantees no-cost coverage of contraception. She opposes raising the minimum wage, mandating paid family leave, and enacting legislation that would close the gender pay gap. Democratic politicians didn\u2019t fabricate these issues to advance their own case. Voters know these issues are the bedrock of their health and economic wellbeing, and the GOP is hoping to convince them otherwise.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "The New York Times recently described Carly Fiorina, the only woman among 17 Republican candidates for president, as the GOP's \"weapon against the 'war on women' charge.\"&nbsp;The Times is right: She\u2019s a Trojan horse.
