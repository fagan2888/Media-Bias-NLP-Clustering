On Monday’s edition of Fox News’ “Outnumbered,” hosts Jedediah Bila and Andrea Tantaros, along with guest Rep. Sean Duffy (R-WI) discussed the hidden liberal agenda behind snow days.

They were responding to news that a town near Boston, MA had recently opted to eliminate two Jewish holidays and one Christian holiday from the remaining school year instead of extending it into late June. As of Sunday evening, Boston has officially had its snowiest winter ever, resulting in an exorbitant number of snow days.

Bila argued that schools should start earlier instead of eliminating holidays to “avoid angering this religious group or that religious group.”
