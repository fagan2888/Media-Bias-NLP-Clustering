Earlier on Wednesday, the administration warned that Congress needed to act immediately to replenish the soon-to-be-missing Ebola funds as that virus is still flaring up in some parts of West Africa.\n\n\"We should not play with fire here,\" OMB Director Shaun Donovan told reporters on a press call. \"We should not risk the outbreak getting out of control before Congress acts.\"\n\n\"Zika and Ebola are real threats,\" former White House Ebola czar Ron Klain tweeted. \"Shifting money around is a Band-Aid solution. Congress needs to act.\"\n\nMEET THE NEWEST INSURANCE STARTUP: BRIGHT HEALTH \u2014 The Minneapolis startup has pedigree \u2014 it's run by former UnitedHealthcare CEO Bob Sheehey \u2014 and reasonably deep pockets, with $81 million of initial backing. And Bright Health is positioning itself as yet another tech-inflected entrant into the exchange, individual and Medicare Advantage insurance marketplaces, Pro's Darius Tahir reports.\n\nBut while Bessemer Venture Partners investor Steve Kraus acknowledges the similarities to New York-based Oscar Health, he thinks Bright Health has a slightly different concept.\n\n\u2014 How execs see a Bright future: The startup intends to enter various metropolitan areas and form an exclusive contract with one health system. The idea is to integrate closely with the health system, from technology to finances, and ultimately share savings, Kraus says.\n\nFrom Bright Health\u2019s perspective, consumers will enjoy similar technical doodads as Oscar \u2014 for example, telemedicine and appointment scheduling. But Kraus thinks the behind-the-scenes tech integrations with their system partners will distinguish the startup from its competitors: the insurer will get close access to patient EHRs, which should allow them to help manage care more rapidly and effectively. He feels that for most insurers now, who typically see claims 30 days after care is provided, care management is less effective.\n\nTHIS IS THURSDAY PULSE \u2014 Where my planned pun was trumped by Sen.

And that's why the two leaders of the H\u00e9bert School of Medicine at the Uniformed Services University (USU) of the Health Sciences say their institution will walk away from the U.S. News rankings this year.\n\nThe USU's dean and president, respectively, think the rankings don't encourage med school leaders to act in students' best interests. \"Schools have a perverse incentive to boost their rank at the expense of applicants and the public,\" Kellermann and Rice argue.\n\n\u2014 One-size-fits-all rankings? The leaders also say that the rankings miss the unique factors that distinguish med schools from one another, and especially overlook the value of the USU \u2014 which serves as the nation\u2019s federal health sciences university and is the academic center of the military health system.\n\n\"Because we serve as the leadership academy for military health in the United States, our curriculum is unique,\" Kellermann and Rice point out. Namely, their medical students receive an additional 700-plus hours of instruction in combat casualty care, tropical medicine and other military-relevant topics.\n\nKellermann and Rice say that leaders at other institutions have confided they feel \"compelled to participate\" in the rankings, but the USU officials feel empowered by the decision to quit. \"We hope that more medical schools will follow,\" they conclude.\n\nRead their post: http://bit.ly/1Sdl7GE\n\nSCOOP: CALIFORNIA EXCHANGE SEES PROBLEMS WITH UNDOCUMENTED WAIVER \u2014 An Obamacare waiver allowing undocumented immigrants in California to purchase ACA plans at full cost likely couldn't be implemented until at least 2018 if the federal government accepted it, according to an analysis developed by California's exchange.\n\nThe Covered California analysis of several so-called \"Section 1332 waiver\" options was prepared before a Thursday exchange board meeting where members will vote on initial recommendations, Pro's Rachana Pradhan reports.\n\nTRUMP DOESN'T ADDRESS ABORTION CONFERENCE AFTER ALL \u2014 Donald Trump didn't speak with the 115 Forum, a conference of abortion foes in Washington organized by Priests for Life, despite reports that the Republican front-runner would dial in by phone Wednesday.

The lack of transparency also raises questions as to whether drug plan middlemen, pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) corporations, are overpaid by Medicare and other federal health programs. Moreover, when generic drug prices spike, PBM corporations are slow to update reimbursement rates, leaving community pharmacies with payments that don\u2019t cover costs and unsustainable financial losses. H.R. 244 would increase transparency and facilitate timely payment updates.
