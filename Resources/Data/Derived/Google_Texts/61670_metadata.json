It has sued on behalf of all insurers participating in the program, and seeks $5 billion in restitution.According to Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law, if the Obama administration settles, the money would come from the Judgment Fund \u2013 an indefinite appropriation established by Congress and administered by the Treasury Department.\u201cIn this case, the argument is the statute requires the government to put for the risk corridors, but Congress refused to appropriate the money to do that and therefore the court is going to have to award a judgment since the administration, under the direction of Congress, is violating the law,\u201d Jost told The Daily Signal.\u201cAnd therefore the money has to come out of the Judgment Fund that the Court of Claims has to award a judgment against the federal government, which is appropriated money.The suit comes after Congress failed to deliver on promises of billions of dollars of support to the co-ops, which many had counted on in order to remain financially solvent. Absent of that funding, several co-op CEOs said they had no other choice but to fold.Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, have criticized the risk corridor program as an \u201cinsurer bailout\u201d and several believe the suit may end up providing the White House with a way to bypass the funding restriction imposed by Congress.\u201cWhat the insurers are doing is tricky. It\u2019s an end run,\u201d Seth Chandler, a law professor at the University of Houston, told the newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s an end run around congressional prohibition. It\u2019s saying, \u2018Okay, you said the Treasury couldn\u2019t spend money. You\u2019ve broken your promise, and because you broke your promise, we\u2019re going to sue you for breach of contract.\u201dThe Obama administration has not signaled an official position with regard to the case, but both Chandler and Jost agreed that the Justice Department may end up settling the case with insurers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/are-obamacare-insurers-in-for-a-5-billion-windfall-29519.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/iStock_obamacare1_000033980998_Small.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "A controversial lawsuit filed by a nonprofit insurance company could end up reverting billions back to participating carriers", "title": "Are Obamacare insurers in for a $5 billion windfall?"}, "twitter": {"description": "A controversial lawsuit filed by a nonprofit insurance company could end up reverting billions back to participating carriers", "title": "Are Obamacare insurers in for a $5 billion windfall?", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/are-obamacare-insurers-in-for-a-5-billion-windfall-29519.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/iStock_obamacare1_000033980998_Small.jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A controversial lawsuit filed by a nonprofit insurance company could end up reverting billions back to participating carriers", "author": "Caitlin Bronson"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s an end run,\u201d Seth Chandler, a law professor at the University of Houston, told the newspaper.\nIt\u2019s saying, \u2018Okay, you said the Treasury couldn\u2019t spend money.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an end run around congressional prohibition.\nYou\u2019ve broken your promise, and because you broke your promise, we\u2019re going to sue you for breach of contract.\u201dThe Obama administration has not signaled an official position with regard to the case, but both Chandler and Jost agreed that the Justice Department may end up settling the case with insurers.\nAbsent of that funding, several co-op CEOs said they had no other choice but to fold.Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, have criticized the risk corridor program as an \u201cinsurer bailout\u201d and several believe the suit may end up providing the White House with a way to bypass the funding restriction imposed by Congress.\u201cWhat the insurers are doing is tricky."}
