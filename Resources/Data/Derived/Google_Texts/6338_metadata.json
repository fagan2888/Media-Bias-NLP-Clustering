The firm has about 45 clients currently, primarily in West Michigan. Julius said most of them range in size from 100 to 300 employees.\n\nEdify North is itself one of those West Michigan companies on a healthy growth curve. The firm\u2019s revenues have increased by up to 40 percent in some of the last four years, and the staff has increased from just Hill and Julius to five \u2014 or seven, when the two current openings are filled.\n\nHill, 36, is a native of Holland who graduated from Hope College in 2000. He got to know Julius, 35, through her husband, who sails with Hill at the Macatawa Bay Yacht Club, and Hill helped her get a job at the employee benefits agency where he worked in Grand Rapids.\n\nBoth Hill and Julius were at that other agency when Hill learned from a friend about a benefits firm in Fort Lauderdale called Edify that was looking to open a branch office in the Midwest.\n\nHill said he had grown tired of his work. \u201cI felt that my job was basically to try to convince employers and employees that they should feel good about paying more and getting less. And that wasn\u2019t a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nHill and Julius offered to start the new office for Edify in Holland. They got the job and launched Edify North, but several months later, the Fort Lauderdale agency was bought out by Wells Fargo. The new office in Holland wasn\u2019t part of the deal, and the original owners in Florida were willing to largely \u201cwalk away from their investment\u201d here, according to Julius. So, with financial help from some silent partners, Hill and Julius hung on to the agency and have made a go of it.\n\nThey apparently are having more fun now, if their titles are any clue. Hill is the Ambassador of Acronyms, and Julius is Chief Enforcer of New Year\u2019s Resolutions.\n\nThe team at Edify North advises clients \u201con which direction to go, and then facilitates the process from start to finish. That includes negotiating the rates/fees, completing the paperwork, designing the (employee) communication materials, conducting the meetings and submitting the enrollment materials,\u201d said Hill.\n\nJulius said Edify North works with all aspects of employee benefits except 401(k)s. Its insurance expertise includes medical, dental, vision, disability and life, but \u201cprimarily the focus is on medical insurance because that is the most expensive component of the benefit package.\u201d\n\nOne Edify North client is Uniform Color Co. in Holland, which has 240 employees. Its award-winning benefits program was developed with help from Edify North, which took over a health and wellness program that had only 20 percent participation and brought it up to more than 90 percent.\n\nThe Uniform Color Co. program includes biometric screenings and in-depth health evaluations providing the backbone for a comprehensive educational campaign targeted to the specific health risks of employees.\n\nEdify North\u2019s plan helped 10 pre-diabetic employees reduce their risk factors for diabetes and shed their at-risk designation, according to a spokesperson for Edify North. He said other companies do screenings and provide the health report and end it there; Edify North creates an actionable plan with attainable goals and works with employees to reach them, using tools such as exercise and eating plans, quarterly meetings with nurses, newsletters, competitions, etc.\n\nEdify North also helps clients track program goals with a mobile app connected to a scale in the clients\u2019 office; the data is used to help incentivize the programs. Edify North created the app in collaboration with Holland-based Collective Idea.\n\nJulius said the Affordable Care Act has added to the rules and regulations so that employers need professional help wading through them.\n\n\u201cIt could be a full-time job for an employer to try to navigate that and understand health care reform on their own,\u201d she said.\n\nThere will be one noticeable change at Edify North next year: the name. The option Hill and Julius had to keep the name for three years after acquiring the business will expire next summer. No name has been announced yet, but given their penchant for fun, there might be a reference to sailing on Lake Macatawa.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It used to be the annual discussion employee benefits consultants had with their clients was mainly about how to \u201cslice and dice\u201d the health insurance cost wherever possible, and that usually included shifting more of the expense to the employee.
