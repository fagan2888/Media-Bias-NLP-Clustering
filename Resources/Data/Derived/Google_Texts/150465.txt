U.S. Marshals arrested a man Wednesday in connection with a Dec. 10 shooting in Wheat Ridge.

Gregory Junior Kilcollins, 29, was apprehended at about 6 a.m. on the 1800 block of South Alcott Street in Denver without incident.

Kilcollins is being charged with attempted second-degree murder.

He is accused of shooting a man at the Villa Victoria apartment complex near the intersection of West 38th Avenue and Quail Street. Wheat Ridge Police said the victim, who has not been identified, is expected to make a full recovery.

After the Dec. 10 shooting, police said, Kilcollins fled the complex in a gray Hyundai Elantra with a white Playboy Bunny sticker in the rear window. Wheat Ridge Police found the car Dec. 11, but there was no sign of Kilcollins.

Kilcollins is being held at the Jefferson County Detention Facility.

In 2007, Kilcollins escaped from a work crew in a Department of Transportation van while serving time for marijuana possession.

The driver left the keys in the white van while going inside a tire store to talk about getting a slow leak repaired, and Kilcollins, who had been in jail on misdemeanor traffic or drug charges seven times since 2003, drove off. The van was pulling a small trailer carrying tools.

Updated Dec. 18, 2014 at 9:55 a.m. This story was corrected to reflect that Kilcollins was apprehended without incident. The original story said several shots were fired in the arrest.
