Dan Branch of Dallas, Sen. Ken Paxton of McKinney and Railroad Commission Chairman Barry Smitherman have adjusted their campaigns to cater to the realities of GOP primary politics. They are tripping over each other to stake out ground on the right.\n\n\u201cSince the candidates are so similar, the curiosity is where they stand beyond the duties of the AG\u2019s office,\u201d said conservative radio host Mark Davis, who has interviewed the candidates on his KSKY-AM (660) show. \u201cThe primary voters are looking for something else. They want to know what kind of heart beats in their conservative chest.\u201d\n\nDianne Edmondson, chairman of the Denton County Republican Party, which hosted the candidates for a recent forum, agreed that running for attorney general required more than a good legal r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\n\u201cThe voters want to know what kind of conservative is going to replace General Abbott,\u201d Edmondson said. \u201cConservative principles are important. They are the cornerstone of what voters are looking for.\u201d\n\nResponsibilities\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s office is charged with \u201cdefending the laws and the Constitution of the state of Texas,\u201d as well as approving public bond issues.\n\nThe office is best known to most Texans for collecting child support, the work that most of its employees perform. Other major functions include protecting Texas consumers against fraud and administering the state crime victims\u2019 compensation fund.\n\nNone of these issues, however, is top of mind to voters, so the contest for attorney general is often obscured by the more compelling races for Texas governor and lieutenant governor, where candidates can run on or from their legislative records.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Abbott is a conservative firebrand who has made his crusade against the federal government the starting point of the campaign to replace him.\n\nIn an era when Republicans are facing internal challenges from activists on the right and face purity tests on an array of issues, candidates in judicial and law enforcement contests have to talk about issues that they can often do little about in the posts they seek.\n\nNo more was that displayed than in the Denton GOP\u2019s recent debate. A large segment was spent on states\u2019 rights and secession. It followed Smitherman\u2019s earlier comments that Texas should prepare itself to be an independent nation.\n\n\u201cSome people say I was advocating secession. I\u2019m not an advocate of secession, I\u2019m an advocate of preparation,\u201d Smitherman said. \u201cWe\u2019re not interconnected with the rest of the country. We can maintain our own independence.\u201d\n\nOther candidates had to address the question, but they did so less directly. Branch talked about standing up to the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThis is the fundamental reason for me to run for attorney general, standing up to an overreaching, aggressive and, I would say with this administration, an arrogant federal government,\u201d he said.\n\nStopping illegal immigration has also been a topic of discussion, though aside from enforcing state laws that could be developed to deal with the matter, the attorney general has little to say on the issue.\n\n\u201cWe do need to put more money into border security,\u201d Paxton said. The attorney general has little influence on lawmakers\u2019 budget-writing process.\n\nThe candidates have sparred on several issues involving qualifications and leadership.\n\nPaxton, who is trying to rally tea party support to break from the pack, says he\u2019s the only candidate with a proven track record as an uncompromising conservative.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy in the Republican primary to say you\u2019re going to stand up to Obama,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is, how do you know?\u201d\n\nSmitherman noted that he has run the state Public Utilities Commission and is now chairman of the Railroad Commission, giving him the advantage of being an executive.\n\nExperience\n\nBranch likes to dismiss Smitherman\u2019s prosecutorial experience, dismissing him at one debate as a \u201cjunior prosecutor that was involved in handling misdemeanor cases.\u201d\n\nSmitherman countered that misdemeanors were serious crimes that needed to be prosecuted. And he injects Obama into his argument.\n\n\u201cEvery candidate talks about fighting Obama,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m fighting Obama. I\u2019ve sued the federal government seven times.\u201d\n\nThe statement echoes Abbott, who jokes that he wakes up in the morning and thinks about how to sue the Obama administration.\n\nBranch, one of the most influential members of the House, also attacks Obama at every turn.\n\n\u201cThe environment we\u2019re in is going to get worse than what General Abbott experienced,\u201d Branch said. \u201cWe\u2019d better stand up.\u201d\n\nVeteran GOP consultant Craig Murphy said voters don\u2019t care about the mechanics of the attorney general\u2019s office but base their votes on more of a gut check.\n\n\u201cThey want to know, \u2018Are they honest? Are they good people, and do they share my values?\u2019\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThat\u2019s where campaigns are won or lost.\u201d\n\nFollow Gromer Jeffers Jr. on Twitter at @gromerjeffers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservative GOP primary voters are more focused on core values than job functions such as child support, experts say.", "og": {"description": "Conservative GOP primary voters are more focused on core values than job functions such as child support, experts say.", "title": "Secession, Obama get more talk in Texas attorney general race than job\u2019s main functions", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140126-secession-obama-get-more-talk-in-texas-attorney-general-race-than-jobs-main-functions.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-01-27T05:31:00Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-01-27T05:22:01Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Secession, Obama get more talk in Texas attorney general race than job\\u2019s main functions\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20140126-secession-obama-get-more-talk-in-texas-attorney-general-race-than-jobs-main-functions.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1402965\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-01-27T05:22:01Z\", \"section\": \"Politics Headlines\", \"author\": \"GROMER JEFFERS Jr.\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-01-27T05:22:01Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "The Republican candidates for Texas attorney general talk more about secession than child support.\n\u201cThe environment we\u2019re in is going to get worse than what General Abbott experienced,\u201d Branch said.\nThe attorney general has little influence on lawmakers\u2019 budget-writing process.\n\u201cThe voters want to know what kind of conservative is going to replace General Abbott,\u201d Edmondson said.\n\u201cThis is the fundamental reason for me to run for attorney general, standing up to an overreaching, aggressive and, I would say with this administration, an arrogant federal government,\u201d he said."}
