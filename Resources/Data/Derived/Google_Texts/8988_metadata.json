I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she told CBS News.\n\nThe HealthCare.gov website will still be a work in progress beyond the end of the month, Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said recently, appearing to soften a promise that the site will be working by then for the vast majority of users.\n\n\u201cThe 30th of November is not a magic go, no go date. It is a work of constant improvement. We have some very specific things we know we need to complete by the 30th and that punch list is getting knocked out every week,\u201d Sebelius told The Associated Press.\n\nFederal health officials also revealed that just 26,794 people enrolled for health insurance through the federal website during the first, flawed month of operations, and a total of 106,000 nationwide \u2014 a small fraction of what they had projected.\n\nDays later, the House voted to weaken a core component of \u201cObamacare\u201d and permit the sale of individual health coverage that falls short of requirements in the law. More than three dozen Democrats broke ranks and supported the legislation, a total that underscored the growing importance of the issue in the weeks since millions of cancellation notices went out to consumers covered by plans deemed inadequate under government rules.\n\n(TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2013 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
