Because Germany has an expression \u201cgood tennis\u201d, apparently, used in admiration of something well executed, and this was an ironic protest to suggest the reverse. But also because tennis balls are cheap, easily smuggled in and unthreatening. We in England have an expression \u201cnot cricket\u201d that means roughly the same as (not) \u201cgood tennis\u201d, but cricket balls are expensive and anyone caught hurling them at a football pitch could reasonably be charged with launching a dangerous projectile.\n\nRelated: Liverpool owner backs down on ticket prices and apologises to fans\n\nSlight difference in methods of making a point apart, it is interesting that the admission price issue has blown up in Germany at the same time as in England, because football supporters in this country often hold up the German model as a fan-friendly and economically fair system for the rest of the world to follow.\n\nThe Dortmund fans were angry about Stuttgart charging prices of up to \u20ac70 in the visitors end, about \u00a355. That is high, even by English standards, though it was a cup game rather than a league fixture, not all of the visitors\u2019 tickets were as expensive, and the prices related to seats, not standing areas. While it remains true that admission to Bundesliga games is significantly cheaper than to Premier League matches, one reason why prices stay relatively low and tickets can often be bought on the day is that many are still for standing terraces. Seats tend to be more expensive, though not usually massively so, hence the protests at Stuttgart trying to make a killing from the fans.\n\n\u201cFootball must be affordable\u201d, a Dortmund banner read, which, if you like, is a polite, more reasoned version of \u201cYou greedy bastards, enough is enough\u201d. Here is the nub of the issue, then. Why must football be affordable? And, perhaps, beyond that, what is affordable anyway? As Liverpool\u2019s Ian Ayre said rather blithely in defence of the Anfield price hike, before he realised quite how serious his customers were about taking action, what is affordable to one person is different for another.\n\nAll a football club needs to continue at a profit, in other words, is to keep finding 45,000 or so people willing to pay the prices charged. That most clubs have managed to keep filling their grounds when prices reached scandalous levels some years ago is a testament to either the intoxicating excitement of Premier League football or the blind loyalty of the fans, depending upon how cynical a view one takes. But from the clubs\u2019 perspective it is no mean feat of profit extraction either. It takes a certain nerve to keep pushing prices up when the television money rolling in means that gate receipts are becoming ever more insignificant as a revenue stream, and though pointing it out feels rather like taking the Sheriff of Nottingham\u2019s side over Robin Hood, the idea that Premier League football is so special and successful it is worth the expense has been taken further than anyone really thought possible. Even Stella Artois does not refer to its product as \u201creassuringly expensive\u201d any more.\n\nBut football is not a lager, or a trip to the cinema, a night at the opera or any of the other occasional treats to which it keeps being fatuously compared. The trouble with what Ayre said about relative affordability is that it goes against the grain at his own club, which prides itself (or always used to) on a sense of community and for years tried to keep prices as low as possible in recognition of the fact that the local economy was somewhat depressed.\n\nIn addition to the notion of community is continuity. Looking beyond concepts such as local support or the traditional fanbase to find people who can afford to pay for seats is a short-term strategy fraught with danger. Should fashions or allegiances change and the money start to go elsewhere, the disenfranchised will not immediately return to take up the slack because the chain will have been broken. A generation will have grown up without the football habit.\n\nAnyone who imagines football is such a wonderful spectator event that crowds will always keep coming should look around most of Europe, Germany apart. Priced right, football can, to an extent, be an off-the-shelf commercial transaction like any other, though what has been unique about it over the last century or so is its family aspect. The father and son tradition, if you will, though there is no reason to exclude anyone on gender grounds.\n\nThe idea that you first go to football with your parents, and end up taking your own offspring, is one of the reasons club allegiances and weekend habits are so powerful. You just don\u2019t get the same sort of thing with supermarkets and cinemas.\n\nFootball as a birthright, and later as a rite of passage, is still just about possible, but especially at the bigger clubs it can be ruinously expensive. Which, quite simply, it was never supposed to be. When Lord Justice Taylor stipulated all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, he did so with the proviso that clubs should not align general admission prices with the cost of their existing seats, and felt that the modernisation could and should be accomplished without ordinary fans paying through the nose.\n\nRelated: Power to the people: Liverpool fans\u2019 ticket price victory may be just the start | Owen Gibson\n\nHe did not actually use the expression paying through the nose but that is what has happened, and Taylor would be extremely disappointed to see the way clubs have ignored his specific warnings. Is it too late to turn back the clock? There will never be a better time, with the television deal presently on the table. Nor are prices around \u00a325 or \u00a330 ludicrously optimistic, for inflation and a modest increase for seating would not have pushed them any higher.\n\nBut progress will be made in this area only if clubs act together. No one is going to voluntarily put themselves at a financial disadvantage, not even Liverpool. While what has just happened in Liverpool and Boston is worth celebrating, it would be as well to remember that what has actually been preserved is the status quo, and Anfield attendees have been complaining about that for years. Prices remain far too high; an across-the-board reduction is necessary, justifiable and now possible.\n\nBut clubs will act together only if they get a firm nudge from government. At prime minister\u2019s question time, the nation\u2019s most prominent West Ham-Aston Villa supporter has promised to look into it. Actually David Cameron should do more than that: he should bang a few heads together. There is a wrong here that needs righting. Forget the free market for a while, Dave, and do something for the common good. There might even be votes in it.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Liverpool fans\u2019 protests over pricing should only be the start \u2013 an across-the-board reduction is now possible but clubs and the government must act as one", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Paul Wilson", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Liverpool fans\u2019 protests over pricing should only be the start \u2013 an across-the-board reduction is now possible but clubs and the government must act as one", "title": "Football must be affordable so let\u2019s get together on ticket pricing | Paul Wilson", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/feb/13/liverpool-football-ticket-pricing-premier-league", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c84a49487f0521bd01b246d1388fad45b6154e9/31_24_3220_1932/master/3220.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=ccf58e4611f81de63d40603619b73c8c", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://football/blog/2016/feb/13/liverpool-football-ticket-pricing-premier-league?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/feb/13/liverpool-football-ticket-pricing-premier-league", "iphone": "gnmguardian://football/blog/2016/feb/13/liverpool-football-ticket-pricing-premier-league?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "site": "@guardian", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/2c84a49487f0521bd01b246d1388fad45b6154e9/31_24_3220_1932/master/3220.jpg", "creator": "@paulwilsongnm"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://football/blog/2016/feb/13/liverpool-football-ticket-pricing-premier-league?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Premier League,Liverpool,Ticket prices,Football,Sport,Consumer affairs", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2016-02-13T21:00:01.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paulwilson", "section": "Football", "modified_time": "2016-04-04T11:08:10.000Z", "tag": "Premier League,Liverpool,Ticket prices,Football,Sport,Consumer affairs"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c84a49487f0521bd01b246d1388fad45b6154e9/31_24_3220_1932/3220.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=a280fb4e205588259d78c52a47405c59", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Premier League,Liverpool,Ticket prices,Football,Sport,Consumer affairs"}, "article_summary": "\u201cFootball must be affordable\u201d, a Dortmund banner read, which, if you like, is a polite, more reasoned version of \u201cYou greedy bastards, enough is enough\u201d.\nThe Dortmund fans were angry about Stuttgart charging prices of up to \u20ac70 in the visitors end, about \u00a355.\nWhy tennis balls, as strewn all over Stuttgart\u2019s pitch last week by Borussia Dortmund fans incensed at the price of admission?\nWhy must football be affordable?\nAnyone who imagines football is such a wonderful spectator event that crowds will always keep coming should look around most of Europe, Germany apart."}
