UnitedHealthcare is officially pulling out of the Affordable Care Act marketplace for 2017.

"UnitedHealthcare will not offer plans on the individual exchange in New Jersey in 2017," the company said in a statement. "Individuals impacted by these decisions will continue to have access to their current health benefits until the end of 2016, when they will need to pick new plans for 2017. Our small and large group business, Medicare and Medicaid businesses will not be impacted by this decision."

The news comes less than a month after initially announcing in a UnitedHealth Group earnings call that the insurer was pulling out from several states.

The last count was more than two dozen, according to Bloomberg.

â€œThe smaller overall market size and shorter-term, higher-risk profile within this market segment continue to suggest we cannot broadly serve it on an effective and sustained basis. Next year, we will remain in only a handful of states, and we will not carry financial exposure from exchanges into 2017," according to the call last month.

According to a letter from the state Department of Banking and Insurance, UHC cannot introduce a new individual plan in the next five years.

"Further, as a result of the withdrawal from the individual market, Oxford HMO may not provide for the issuance of any health benefits plan in the individual market during the five-year period beginning upon the expiration of Dec. 31, 2016," the letter said.
