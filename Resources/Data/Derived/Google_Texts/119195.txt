Conservative breakout star Dr. Ben Carson officially dipped his toe into 2016 presidential waters Wednesday night, announcing the formal launch of his political action committee and promising that his USA First PAC will “lay the groundwork if in the future there is a decision to run … for public office,” The Washington Times reports “I continue to think that sometimes things happen in your life that are bigger than you are, that was never my intention certainly to be thinking about running for the top political office in our nation, but sometimes things evolve in a certain direction,” Carson told 5,000 listeners during a teleconference.In an email teasing the call and inviting Americans to participate, Carson wrote that he would discuss several things concerning the upcoming election and that he had a “big announcement” to make.During the call, Carson revealed that he would soon be endorsing his first 10 candidates running in the November midterms, calling the list “Ben’s Ten.”He answered questions posed by callers, who used their time to heap praise and support on Carson, according to the Times.“If you run for office, I will do anything I can to help you, with my money, with my time … you are the one source of salvation that we have,” one woman said.“I’m not going to ask ‘if you run,’ I’m going to ask ‘when you run’ because it’s the only way my grandchildren will have a future,” said another.USA First PAC will “elect people who will understand the United States,” Carson said.“They understand our culture, they understand our values, they understand that this is a country that is supposed to be for, of and by the people. Not for, of and by the government,” he said.The call took place during the same time President Barack Obama addressed America on television to lay out the United States’ plans to defeat ISIS.The outspoken pediatric neurosurgeon, who has emerged as a chief critic of Obamacare, also made headlines this week for remarks he made on Newsmax TV cautioning the public not to demonize Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice for knocking his wife unconscious during a domestic dispute captured on a hotel video surveillance camera. Carson said Rice “obviously has some real problems” and needs help.In a piece he penned in Time, Carson wrote that the video “does not account for what went on before that moment nor the work that the couple has done in the months since the incident to repair the bonds of trust and respect between them and strengthen their family.”
