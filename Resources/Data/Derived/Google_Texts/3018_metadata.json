The face of \u201crepeal Obamacare\u201d can\u2019t elude the fact that he\u2019s simply unlikeable. It\u2019s his elitist arrogance, his McCarthy-esque finger wagging and that his name isn\u2019t even Ted.\n\nTed is typically short for Theodore. Mr. Cruz\u2019s real name is Rafael Edward Cruz, but I doubt that name would go over too well with the predominantly white Republican voters he tries to appeal to. The constructed character known as \u201cTed,\u201d built on lies and playground tactics, is dedicated to sticking to his beliefs even when disputed by simple facts and logic.\n\nThis is particularly evident in his distaste for Obamacare, which he called \u201cthe biggest job-killer in this country.\u201d Upon a simple fact-check, what Ted would call \u201cyellow journalism,\u201d one will see that since Obamacare was passed by the Senate in 2010 (took effect in 2014), the number of jobs has risen and the unemployment rate has actually been halved. I\u2019m not implying that Obamacare is what caused the unemployment rate to drop, however, the fact of the matter is that Obamacare hasn\u2019t resulted in a loss of jobs.\n\nDespite these facts, Ted Cruz put himself in the spotlight in 2013 by assisting congress in the federal government shutdown. He spoke for 21 straight hours on the Senate floor in an effort to repeal Obamacare. Cruz found Dr. Seuss\u2019 children\u2019s book \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d to be such a great example of why Obamacare should be repealed that he felt the need to read it on the Senate floor, oblivious to the irony that the book is all about trying something before saying you hate it.\n\nWhen he\u2019s not being a grown man reading children\u2019s books or fabricating lies about Obamacare, he\u2019s shows an inability to have a sophisticated grasp on how to handle ISIS and other threats from abroad. If Cruz becomes president, he said, \u201cWe will carpet bomb [ISIS] into oblivion. I don\u2019t know if sand can glow in the dark, but we\u2019re going to find out.\u201d It became apparent that he was unaware of what carpet bombing was, when he could not explain it and was under the impression that it was just a term for coordinated airstrike.\n\nCruz has repeatedly tried to blur the line between being Muslim and being an extreme radical. According to Cruz, we have our very own \u201cjihadists\u201d in Indiana and Arkansas. When talking to a forum in Iowa last year, Cruz referred to the involvement of the LGBT community in those states as a \u201cjihad\u201d that is being waged against Christians. Classifying those in the LGBT community as being on the same level as Muslim terrorists should have been a low enough point for Cruz, but somehow he felt that his message was still unclear. Cruz then went to Texas to offer his view of how the expansion of ISIS is bad for gay rights, which made things even less clear.\n\nIf you manage to look past his inability to decipher between the LGBT community and ISIS, you have a man trying to ride the support of small businesses. In his opinion, besides carpet bombing Obamacare, the best way to help small businesses is by implementing a flat tax rate and not raising the minimum wage.\n\nIt\u2019s true that implementing Cruz\u2019s flat tax might actually help keep money in the hands of small business owners. However, the flat tax will give tremendous tax cuts to the wealthiest one percent of the country. With this tax plan, over the course of a decade, the federal government would lose out on $8.6 trillion in revenue. Part of government income goes to federal loans that help start small businesses. If the government doesn\u2019t have the money to give to new businesses, then how will the small business sector be rewarded with this tax plan? It won\u2019t.\n\nNot raising the minimum wage sounds like a good idea, however, since the minimum wage hasn\u2019t changed with inflation over the years, people aren\u2019t able to feed their families working 40 hours a week. Without a higher minimum wage, more people will have to turn to government run agencies to seek assistance. If the employer isn\u2019t willing to pay a higher minimum wage, the government has to pick up the tab. If you support a smaller government that offers less federally-funded programs, then raising the minimum wage and making the employers themselves pay would be a more feasible idea.\n\nIn spite of his major policy flaws, Cruz has drawn many comparisons to the President beloved by democrats, Barack Obama. They both come from American mothers and immigrant fathers. They both ran for president after only one term as a Senator and graduated from Harvard Law School. However, Barack Hussein Obama ran for president with the name on his American birth certificate. Ted Cruz isn\u2019t even running for president with the name on his Canadian birth certificate.", "article_metadata": {"language": "en, sv", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Corsair", "description": "Point/Counter-Point: To see the other side of this argument, read \u201cA Case for Ted Cruz\u201d,\u00a0here.
