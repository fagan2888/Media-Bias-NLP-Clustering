The local announcement stated that upcoming changes established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act were part of the reason for the closure. As a physician and a healthcare consultant whose life and career have been greatly impacted by the same legislation, Dr. Lambert was moved to take a closer look. But while looking at the history of the hospital and his hometown, he was forced to look at his own history as well.\n\nDr. Lambert does much of his consulting work with electronic health records; his first thought was to look at his own medical records. This brought him back home to get his records and to interview old friends in order to learn more about the situation. As the story began to unfold, he realized that the closure had been a long time coming, and the stories he heard sounded very similar to other hospitals around the country; stories heard both as a clinician and a consultant.\n\nIn the book, Dr. Lambert reflects on personal experiences, healthcare and otherwise, and extrapolates these to other health systems facing similar changes. From there, the discussion turns to where we were are heading on a national scale and how that course will be influenced by our history and our policies. He says, \u201cI was surprised at how personal the book turned out, but I think that being self-critical allowed me to be critical of Parkersburg, the healthcare industry, and our politics.\u201d The book takes the viewpoint that to achieve transformation in the healthcare industry, a change is required not only in public opinion, but also in our behavior. Dr. Lambert says, \u201cThe path to sustainable healthcare is in sight, but we need to effect change within ourselves for it to be successful.\u201d\n\nThe ebook is published by BookBaby and available on Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble, and iBooks.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nMatt Lambert, M.D. is an emergency medicine physician, healthcare consultant, musician, and author.
