A standout star on NBC\u2019s \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"NewsRadio,\" and a popular voice-over artist on Fox\u2019s \"The Simpsons,\" he was beloved by millions worldwide. But when it came to marriage, Phil faltered \u2014 though not for lack of trying. Famously, his wounded third union, to the increasingly troubled Brynn Omdahl, ended in tragedy when Brynn shot Phil and then herself in the early morning hours of May 28, 1998. And while it is by no means the defining moment of Phil\u2019s colorful life, his shocking death still resonates deeply with family, friends and fans. Until now, however, little was known about what really happened. Here, more than 16 years after Phil\u2019s passing, is the most complete account ever of that fateful night.\n\nMay 28, 1998\u2014early morning\n\nAccording to police, the most likely scenario for what then transpired is this: sometime in the next couple of hours, as Phil sleeps with his bent right leg exposed atop the sheet and cover and his left arm extended straight out beneath him, Brynn enters the master bathroom suite. There, on a closet shelf, is the metal lockbox in which she and Phil keep their firearms and gun supplies. Extracting his Smith & Wesson .38, she returns to where her husband lies. From her side of the bed, she takes aim and fires the first shot. A second and a third follow. One strikes the right side of Phil\u2019s neck, just lateral to his chin. Another enters through his posterior right forearm, exits out the anterior, and re-enters his right lower chest. Both are fired from no more than eighteen inches away, the latter causing a fatal wound. The most damaging shot, also fatal, is fired at point-blank or nearly point-blank range and enters just above the bridge of Phil\u2019s nose, passing through his skull and brain before it comes to rest. Death is quick, perhaps instantaneous. Incongruously, he seems to be smiling, as if in the middle of a sweet dream.\n\nAn hour or so later, probably after drinking more alcohol and possibly after snorting cocaine (though she may have done so earlier), Brynn phones her longtime friend Ron Douglas, who lives in nearby Studio City. It is 3:25 a.m. She tells him Phil isn\u2019t home, but that he left a note: \u201cI\u2019m going out for the night. I\u2019ll be back\u2014Phil. Love you.\u201d Brynn doesn\u2019t want to be alone, she tells Douglas, who dismisses the idea of her returning to his house. It\u2019s too late, he says, and she can\u2019t leave her kids unsupervised. Drink a glass of milk, he advises, take some aspirin, and go back to sleep. Irritated, he tries to do likewise.\n\nTwenty minutes later Douglas hears his doorbell ringing repeatedly, along with banging on his front door. Still aggravated and now bleary-eyed, he walks downstairs and peers out the window. Brynn is outside in a long-sleeved pullover T-shirt, white pajama bottoms, and light-colored argyle socks\u2014no shoes. Her hair is still down, long and straight, and she clutches her Prada purse. When Douglas opens the door to ask her what\u2019s going on, he catches a strong whiff of alcohol on her breath. She\u2019s drunk\u2014he can tell. And Douglas is angry\u2014she can tell. \u201cDon\u2019t yell at me!\u201d Brynn says on her way inside. \u201cPhil yells at me all the time.\u201d\n\nStumbling into Douglas\u2019s house, Brynn attempts to sit on the living room sofa but slides off onto the floor. Crying, she blurts out something about having killed Phil. Douglas thinks little of the hysterical statement, assuming she and Phil merely had another fight. Besides, Brynn is obviously inebriated. Still on the floor, she looks as though she is nodding off. Douglas tells her she smells like a brewery and chastises her again. Brynn says her stomach hurts, that she\u2019s sick, and passes out. Guessing she might have taken an overdose of pills, Douglas wakes her. When he does, she runs to the bathroom and vomits. This happens several times: nod off, run to the bathroom, vomit. Douglas decides he should keep her awake until she sobers up. To that end, he serves her water and hot tea.\n\nAt Brynn\u2019s requests, Douglas calls the Hartman home several times. There is never an answer and he leaves no messages. During one of his calls, Brynn starts to root around in her purse. For what, she does not say. Then it tumbles out onto the floor: the Smith & Wesson .38. Douglas is incredulous, asks her what she\u2019s doing with it. Brynn picks it up and doesn\u2019t respond. Give it to me, he demands, and Brynn complies. Upon opening the gun\u2019s cylinder and spinning it around, he sees what appear to be all six cartridges in their chambers. Which means, he assumes, that no bullets have left their berths. A feeling of mild relief sweeps over him and he stashes the piece in a kitchen drawer. \u201cSee?\u201d Brynn says. \u201cI told you I killed Phil!\u201d Douglas remains doubtful.\n\nA little before six a.m., not long before her kids usually awaken and after two and a half tortured hours at Douglas\u2019s house, Brynn finally seems sober enough to drive home. But she agrees to do so only if Douglas follows her back. He should bring the gun, too, she tells him. Fetching it from the drawer and checking its cylinder again while staring down the barrel, Douglas notices something he hadn\u2019t before: two of the bullets are missing. (In fact, as he\u2019ll later learn, three are gone.) Hoping Brynn might only have fired warning shots into the air, he puts the gun inside a tan plastic SAV-ON shopping bag and rushes out behind his frantic friend. He doesn\u2019t want to, but feels he has to. Placing the concealed weapon in his trunk, he gets behind the wheel of his black Lincoln Town Car and starts the engine.\n\nAround six a.m., as Douglas tails Brynn back to Encino, she phones her good friend Judy. \u201cOh, God!\u201d Brynn exclaims when Judy answers. \u201cI think I killed Phil!\u201d Hysterical and sobbing, she is speeding and driving erratically; traffic laws mean little. She blows red tri-light signals at two intersections.\n\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d Judy asks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Brynn replies. \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d \u201cMy life is over!\u201d\n\nTrying to pinpoint her location, Judy asks Brynn to read off a couple of street signs. Sepulveda and Ventura, Brynn tells her. She is close to home. Judy hangs up, gets dressed, and drives over to 5065 Encino Avenue.\n\nMinutes later Brynn arrives there and pulls into the garage. Douglas finds a street spot nearby. He retrieves the .38 from his trunk and follows Brynn through the garage entrance. Once inside, he trails her down a long hallway to the master bedroom at the north end. Peering in, he sees Phil\u2019s motionless body on the bed and soon notices the bullet wound in his head.\n\n\u201cOh, my God, he\u2019s dead!\u201d Brynn screams. \u201cI told you I did! I told you I did! I killed him! I killed him! I don\u2019t know why!\u201d\n\nDouglas just stands there for a moment, the horror before him sinking in. Things seem to be moving in slow motion. Out of her mind with grief and panic, Brynn makes another call\u2014to her friends Steve and Marcy. She tells Steve what she told Douglas and Judy: \u201cI killed Phil!\u201d Steve tells Marcy. They, too, drive over from their house just three blocks away.\n\nNow Douglas is in the hallway outside the master bedroom. There is a phone nearby. He picks up the receiver and dials 9-1-1.\n\nPolice dispatcher: Emergency operator 614.\n\nDouglas: Yeah, hi, this is 5065 Encino Boulevard. And, um, I was called over to the residence. I think there\u2019s been a shooting here. (Douglas speaks in an unsteady monotone.)\n\nPolice dispatcher: OK, do you see a victim?\n\nDouglas: Yes.\n\nPolice dispatcher: OK, hold on for the paramedics, OK? One moment.\n\nDouglas: OK.\n\nPolice dispatcher: I want you to stay on the line.\n\nDouglas: OK.\n\nFire dispatcher: Fire Department emergency operator, how may I help you?\n\nDouglas: Yeah, hi, there\u2019s been a shooting at 5065 Encino Boulevard.\n\nFire dispatcher: How many people are shot?\n\nDouglas: Just one, and um . . .\n\nFire dispatcher: Do you know what part of the body? Douglas: I think around the head and the neck. I just got here.\n\nFire dispatcher: The person who shot him, is he still around? Douglas: Yeah, she\u2019s his wife.\n\nFire dispatcher: [T]he wife shot him and they\u2019re both there? Douglas: Yeah.\n\nFire dispatcher: Is she hurt at all?\n\nDouglas: I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m trying to calm her down. OK?\n\n(The police dispatcher comes back on the line.)\n\nPolice dispatcher: Hello, sir?\n\nDouglas: Yeah.\n\nPolice dispatcher: Did, uh, was this on purpose or was this an accident or what, sir?
