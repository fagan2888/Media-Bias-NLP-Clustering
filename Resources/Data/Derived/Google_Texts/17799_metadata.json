I resigned from my position on December 5, 2012 for personal reasons,\u201d Loehmann wrote in a March 12 statement detailing his work history.\n\nHowever, documents from the Independence Police Department tell a different story \u2014 that the officer who shot and killed Rice for playing with a toy pistol had a flawed gun handling record himself, and that had he not formally resigned from his job he would have been dismissed.\n\nIn a November 2012 letter contained in Loehmann\u2019s file, Independence Deputy Chief Jim Pulak recounted a disturbing series of events in which the young officer buckled under pressure, displayed startling emotional immaturity, and conducted the most basic functions of his job with apathy and carelessness. \u201cHe was not mentally prepared to do firearm training,\u201d Pulak wrote, adding that during firearms qualification training Loehmann was \u201cdistracted and weepy. He could not follow simple directions, could not communicate clear thoughts nor recollections, and his handgun performance was dismal. After some talking it was clear to Sgt. Tinnirello that the recruit was just not mentally prepared to be doing firearm training.\u201d\n\nPulak attributes Loehmann\u2019s emotional volatility to a turbulent relationship with his \u201con and off again girlfriend whom he was dealing with till 0400 hrs the night before. Some of the comments made by Ptl. Loehmann during this discourse were to the effect of, \u2018I should have gone to NY,\u2019 \u2018maybe I should quit,\u2019 \u2018I have no friends,\u2019 \u2018I only hang out with 74 yr old priests,\u2019 \u2018I have cried every day for 4 months about this girl.'\u201d\n\nHe concluded that Loehmann \u201cdoes not possess the maturity, commitment, and discretion necessary to perform well as an officer and recommended that he be \u201creleased from the employment of the City of Independence. Due to this dangerous loss of composure during live range training and his inability to manage this personal stress, I do not believe Ptl. Loehmann shows the maturity needed to work in our employment\u2026I do not believe time, nor training, will be able to change or correct these deficiencies.\u201d\n\nOn March 3, the day of Loehmann\u2019s hiring, he consented to a background check commissioned by the City of Cleveland. In a stunning lack of oversight, however, the Cleveland Police Department never reviewed Loehmann\u2019s Independence personnel file before hiring him \u2014 though they did hire detectives to conduct the check. Loehmann was hired despite a sub-standard work history, acknowledgment of under-the-table jobs directly preceding his employment, and explicit red flags raised by former police officers.\n\nIn Loehmann\u2019s personnel requisition, the Cleveland Police Department defines his position\u2019s primary responsibilities: \u201cProtect life and property. Enforces laws and ordinances. Prevents and detects crime. Acts without direct supervision and exercises independent judgment in meeting complex situations.\u201d\n\nThinkProgress contacted the City of Independence Police Department for comment on Loehmann\u2019s troubles but has not heard back.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "He was hired anyway.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "He was hired anyway.", "title": "On Job Application, Cop Who Killed 12-Year-Old Listed \u2018Under-The-Table Jobs\u2019 As Prior Employment", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2014/12/05/3599851/cleveland-cop-who-guns-down-12-year-old-boy-admits-to-under-the-table-jobs-on-police-application/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP15594127985.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He was hired anyway.", "creator": "@E_Hellerstein", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP15594127985-321x214.jpg", "title": "On Job Application, Cop Who Killed 12-Year-Old Listed \u2018Under-The-Table Jobs\u2019 As Prior Employment", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP15594127985.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP15594127985.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-05T10:27:09+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ericalhellerstein"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca564\"", "article_summary": "Justice On Job Application, Cop Who Killed 12-Year-Old Listed \u2018Under-The-Table Jobs\u2019 As Prior Employment CREDIT: AP Photo/Tony Dejak Demonstrators block Public Square in Cleveland, during a protest.\nDespite listing his primary source of income for six months prior to his application as \u201cunder-the-table jobs,\u201d Loehmann was nevertheless hired for the law enforcement position in March 2013.\n\u201cHe was not mentally prepared to do firearm training,\u201d Pulak wrote, adding that during firearms qualification training Loehmann was \u201cdistracted and weepy.\nLoehmann was hired despite a sub-standard work history, acknowledgment of under-the-table jobs directly preceding his employment, and explicit red flags raised by former police officers.\nIn Loehmann\u2019s personnel requisition, the Cleveland Police Department defines his position\u2019s primary responsibilities: \u201cProtect life and property."}
