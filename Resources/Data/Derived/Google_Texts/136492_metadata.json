But during the event, hosted by Prestonwood Baptist Church and the Faith and Freedom Coalition, the ability of evangelicals to affect political change was as much on stage as the candidates.\n\nMore than a decade ago, conservative Christians dominated American politics. Today, it\u2019s a different era, and Bible-believing Christians appear to have lost their powers of political persuasion. The number of Americans identifying as Christian is on the decline: A Pew Research Center study released in May shows an 8 percent drop over the last seven years among U.S. adults identifying as Christian. Meanwhile, the same study found the number of U.S. adults who do not identify with any organized religion is on the upswing.\n\nAccording to Jack Graham, senior pastor of the 40,000-member church hosting yesterday\u2019s event, this changing religious landscape makes it ever more important for Christians to educate themselves on candidates\u2019 positions and align behind those who will lead according to biblical principles.\n\nWe see you\u2019ve been enjoying the content on our exclusive member website.

The pastor touched on Middle East policy, entitlements, the fiscal gap, abortion, religious liberty, and national security. At no point did candidates appear together on stage. Republican front-runner Donald Trump was notably absent, as were Democratic Party favorites Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, all of whom declined organizers\u2019 invitations to participate.\n\nCarly Fiorina was first out of the gate, earning strong applause from the crowd for repeatedly advocating the election of a leader who would \u201crestore the character of this nation.\u201d The former Hewlett-Packard CEO also shared very personal reasons for her support for pro-life policies\u2014from watching the harmful emotional, physical, and spiritual effects abortion had on a friend, to her own mother-in-law being told by doctors she should abort Fiorina\u2019s now husband.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, a Southern Baptist and Texan, held the home court advantage, as evidenced by the six standing ovations the crowd gave him. Cruz played to the audience, citing his \u201cpastor\u2019s kid\u201d status and reminding attendees of his often oppositional stance to Congress, listing Obamacare, \u201cillegal amnesty,\u201d and Planned Parenthood as examples. He also invoked Trump, suggesting the front-runner is asking the most important question in the campaign.\n\n\u201cDonald has framed the central issue in this primary as, \u2018Who will stand up to Washington?\u2019 and if that\u2019s the central issue, the next question is, \u2018Who actually has stood up to Washington?\u2019\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t think of a better question to decide this race, because in that regard, my record is markedly different from anyone else.\u201d\n\nRivaling Cruz in standing ovations was former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., who called himself an \u201cevangelical Catholic\u201d and touted his track record of promoting right-to-life issues, battling the Affordable Care Act, authoring sanctions against Iran, implementing health savings accounts, and most recently producing Christian films. He compared himself to Ronald Reagan, saying just as Reagan cemented his position as an opponent to communism before assuming the presidency, Santorum is making himself known as an enemy of radical Islam.\n\n\u201cISIS knows who I am, Iran knows who I am, and when I get sworn into office in January, the enemies of America will know who they have to deal with,\u201d he said.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee also found himself in friendly territory on Sunday: Prestonwood\u2019s Graham endorsed him for president in 2008. More than any other candidate, Huckabee focused on foreign policy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not unfamiliar with the region,\u201d he said of the Middle East. \u201cBut I\u2019m also very familiar with the fact that the only ally we have in that region that\u2019s reliable is Israel. And we have put more pressure on Israel to stop building bedrooms in Judea and Samaria than we put on Iran to stop building nuclear devices that will one day be aimed at us, and that is an irrational act of madmen.\u201d\n\nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, a Seventh-Day Adventist, shared his story of faith, talking candidly about how his failed attempt as a young man to stab someone in a fit of anger ultimately caused him to question his life\u2019s purpose and drew him to the Bible. He also laughed about how, after 15,000 surgeries, he was looking forward to retirement, and then \u201cthe National Prayer Breakfast happened.\u201d That event catapulted him to national prominence for taking President Barack Obama to task while sharing a stage with him.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WORLD", "description": "CAMPAIGN 2016 | Candidates talk about their faith at Prestonwood Baptist Church in hopes of proving their moralistic mettle", "title": "WORLD | GOP hopefuls preach politics at Texas megachurch | Katie Gaultney | Oct. 19, 2015", "url": "http://www.worldmag.com/2015/10/gop_hopefuls_preach_politics_at_texas_megachurch", "image": "http://www.worldmag.com/media/images/content/santorumandgraham.jpg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "world magazine, christian world news magazine, christian views, christian perspectives, god's world magazine", "description": "CAMPAIGN 2016 | Candidates talk about their faith at Prestonwood Baptist Church in hopes of proving their moralistic mettle"}, "article_summary": "DALLAS\u2014Six Republican presidential hopefuls descended on a north Texas megachurch Sunday to appeal for support from what should be a dependable voting bloc.\nToday, it\u2019s a different era, and Bible-believing Christians appear to have lost their powers of political persuasion.\nMeanwhile, the same study found the number of U.S. adults who do not identify with any organized religion is on the upswing.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m also very familiar with the fact that the only ally we have in that region that\u2019s reliable is Israel.\nLogin Now\u201cIn the last presidential election, many evangelical Christians did not vote,\u201d Graham said."}
