What do a local children’s charity and a federal health care law have in common? More than you might think.

The Affordable Care Act expanded requirements for Medicaid, the federal/state program that helps low-income families and individuals pay for health care.

“More than 90,000 Georgians were assessed ‘Medicaid eligible’ by the marketplace and many of those were children,” says Beth Stephens, the Health Access Program Director for Georgia Watch.

More families qualifying for Medicaid means more kids are in need, according to state officials. That’s why they told Atlanta’s Empty Stocking Fund to expect to hand out gifts to a lot more kids this year.

“It will be the largest number we’ve ever invited and we expect to probably serve between 7 and 10,000 additional children,” says Manda Hunt, the Fund’s executive director.

The charity usually serves about 50,000 kids. Hunt says this year that number will jump about 20 percent.

“We’ve actually been working with our toy vendors to get that need filled, and we think we’re going to be able to accomplish that side of it, but we really need help accomplishing the payment of that side of it,” she says.

Stephens, of Georgia Watch, says such a situation could shine a light on child poverty in the state. Census data show one in every four Georgia children lives in poverty.
