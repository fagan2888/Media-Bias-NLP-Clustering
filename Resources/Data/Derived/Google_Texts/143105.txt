Michael Miller, an assemblyman who represents the Queens district of New York, has proposed banning out-of-state vehicles from parking on city streets between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m. — and towing those found in violation.

It costs abut $185 to get a vehicle out of the city’s impound, The Daily Signal reported.

“By registering out-of-state, you are either committing fraud by not registering your vehicle in New York state or you are avoiding paying state Department of Motor Vehicles fees,” Mr. Miller told the New York Post.

His plan is to give out-of-staters an opportunity to purchase an “exemption sticker” that would let them park overnight, worry-free about tows, The Daily Signal said. But his plan isn’t being cheered by many.

AAA, for instance, called the idea “shortsighted and unfair,” and a disincentive for tourists to visit and stay overnight in the city.
