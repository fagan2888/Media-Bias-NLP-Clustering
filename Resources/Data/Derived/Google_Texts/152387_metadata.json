The audit found that CMS did not have a process to \u201cprevent or detect any possible substantial errors\u201d in subsidy payments.\n\nThe OIG said the agency did not have a system to \u201censure that financial assistance payments were made on behalf of confirmed enrollees and in the correct amounts.\u201d\n\nIn addition, CMS relied too heavily on data from health insurance companies and had no system for state-based exchanges to \u201csubmit enrollee eligibility data for financial assistance payments.\u201d\n\nThe government does \u201cnot plan to perform a timely reconciliation\u201d of the $2.8 billion in subsidies.\n\nThe audit was released as the country awaits a Supreme Court ruling that could make all federal subsidies invalid, since the majority of states did not set up their own health insurance exchange.\n\nEligible individuals enrolled in Obamacare can receive different types of subsidies, including advance premium tax credits (APTCs) and advance cost-sharing reductions (CSR), which can be used towards premiums or out-of-pocket health care costs.\n\nAccording to the OIG, the government still does not have a complete system for approving subsidies distributed though Obamacare. CMS used an \u201cinterim process\u201d to distribute subsidies for 2014, and is planning a \u201cpermanent process\u201d to be finished by late 2015. The final system is supposed to approve enrollment and payment data \u201con an enrollee-by-enrollee basis.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout effective internal controls for ensuring that advance CSR payments are reconciled in a timely manner, a significant amount of Federal funds are at risk,\u201d the OIG said.\n\nThe report noted that multiple agencies within CMS oversee subsidy payments, including the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO), the Office of Financial Management (OFM), the Office of the Actuary (OACT), and the Office of Information Systems (OIS).\n\nIn response to the audit, CMS said they issued a regulation to change their accounting methods.\u201cCMS takes the stewardship of tax dollars seriously and implemented a series of payment and process controls to assist in making manual financial assistance payments accurately to issuers,\u201d they said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The federal government cannot verify nearly $3 billion in subsidies distributed through Obamacare, putting significant taxpayer funding \u201cat risk.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The federal government cannot verify nearly $3 billion in subsidies distributed through Obamacare, putting significant taxpayer funding \u201cat risk,\u201d according to a new audit report.
