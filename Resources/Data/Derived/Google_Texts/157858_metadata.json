He doesn\u2019t know what it is. I like him, and he\u2019s a nice guy, but seriously, that\u2019s not libertarianism.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nHe continued:\n\nThe other thing I\u2019ve found is that a lot of liberals in Hollywood are faux-liberals, and a lot of Republicans in Hollywood are faux-conservatives. When I was a young guy, I was finding myself not quite being able to see the things that were going on and buy into a political culture. I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I finally said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I go back and see what the Founding Fathers were all about, and see how that stacked up.\u201d Well, I found them and I found libertarianism. They were pretty radical guys, and damn smart, and I just believe in that old-time stuff and think they had great ideas. Years later, I had the wonderful opportunity to go to the Cato Institute\u2019s 20th anniversary and spend some real time with some amazing people. I met some great people there, and that cemented it for me. I felt, guess what, there is a place where I can have a conversation and not be laughed at or smirked at.\n\nEver since Hollywood Elsewhere\u2019s Jeff Wells pressed Russell to talk about gun control, now that he\u2019s out of the closet, the longtime star sounds like he\u2019s enjoying his political liberation.\n\nDuring a 2010 appearance on Bill Maher\u2019s HBO show, Andrew Breitbart used Maher\u2019s vigorous campaigning for ObamaCare to expose this same truth. \u201cYou\u2019re officially not a Libertarian anymore, right,\u201d Andrew said to a stunned Maher. \u201cI mean this [ObamaCare] position runs so far from the libertarian position \u2014 so you admit that you have more of a European Socialist-leaning perspective on this issue.\u201d\n\nThe look on Maher\u2019s face is priceless.\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kurt Russell: Bill Maher Is a Fake Libertarian", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Kurt Russell: Bill Maher Is a Fake Libertarian", "title": "Kurt Russell: Bill Maher Is a Fake Libertarian - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/kurt-russell-ap.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2015/12/22/kurt-russell-bill-maher-is-a-fake-libertarian/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kurt Russell: Bill Maher Is a Fake Libertarian", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/12/kurt-russell-ap.jpg", "title": "Kurt Russell: Bill Maher Is a Fake Libertarian - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Andrew Breibart, Bill Maher, Kurt Russell, Libertarian,Big Hollywood,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Hollywood", "tag": "Libertarian", "published_time": "2015-12-22T09:18:58-07:00", "categories": "Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m not a Bill Maher libertarian,\u201d Russell said.\nDuring a 2010 appearance on Bill Maher\u2019s HBO show, Andrew Breitbart used Maher\u2019s vigorous campaigning for ObamaCare to expose this same truth.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTEROut promoting his new film \u201cThe Hateful Eight,\u201d longtime libertarian Kurt Russell opened up again about his politics, this time to the Daily Beast, where he pointed out an obvious fact: that Bill Maher is nothing close to a libertarian.\n\u201cI mean this [ObamaCare] position runs so far from the libertarian position \u2014 so you admit that you have more of a European Socialist-leaning perspective on this issue.\u201dThe look on Maher\u2019s face is priceless.\n\u201cYou\u2019re officially not a Libertarian anymore, right,\u201d Andrew said to a stunned Maher."}
