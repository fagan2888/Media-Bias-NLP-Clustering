Four people are dead and two others are injured after a school shooting in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan.

The Canadian prime minister said from Davos, Switzerland that the suspect is in custody.

The grade 7 through 12 La Loche Community School is in the aboriginal community of La Loche, Saskatchewan.

A government official says at least two people have been shot dead in a school in an aboriginal community in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan.

The official, who received reports from the scene, spoke on condition of anonymity Friday because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The grade 7 through 12 La Loche Community School in the northern Saskatchewan community of La Loche is in lockdown.

Brad Wall, the premier of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, confirmed the shooting at the aboriginal community in the province. He said there are victims but did not say how many or release any other details.

The school's Facebook page says it will remain on lockdown until the Royal Canadian Police resolve the matter. It is asking the public to stay away.
