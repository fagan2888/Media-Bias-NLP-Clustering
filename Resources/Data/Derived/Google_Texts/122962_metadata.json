For example, COR files for a $2.5 million contract lacked status reports and a tally of the funds expended and remaining on the contract,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe State Department appeared to agree with the IG\u2019s recommendations in a March 28 response and said that it intends to ensure that contracts are completed properly.\n\n\u2022 Adam Kredo is senior writer for the Washington Free Beacon.
