The seller was 163 LLC.\n\nThe property, also known as the Calcote Building, was built in 2006 at Rutledge and Doughty streets. It is fully leased, with the Medical University of South Carolina as the anchor tenant.\n\nMedical office buildings have become a hot commercial real estate asset.\n\nThe sector began to blossom during the last recession. Health care weathered the downturn better than most industries, ensuring investors with stable rent streams. The health care industry also has a captive audience in the rapidly growing senior population that will require more medical services in the years ahead.\n\nAt the same time, a growing number of procedures are being performed in offices. Also, Obamacare is expected to trigger a jump in patient visits as insurance coverage is expanded.\n\nIt is Charlotte-based Ferncroft\u2019s third local commercial real estate acquisition.\n\nIn the past two years, the firm has bought two Summerville shopping centers: the 455,000-square-foot North Main Market near Interstate 26 and Highway 17-A, and the 121,000-square-foot Sawmill Village at 680 Bacons Bridge Road.\n\nThis month, the company announced it had purchased a newly redeveloped Publix-anchored grocery retail center on Highway 17 in Pawleys Island for $16.5 million.\n\nFerncroft said on its website that it has acquired more than 2 million square feet of real estate for more than $300 million since 2007.\n\nContact John McDermott at (843) 937-5572.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Charlotte firm buys medical building in downtown Charleston, Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalReal Estate, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Charleston,Charlotte,Commercial real estate,Ferncroft Capital,Medical office buildings,Medical University of South Carolina,North Main Market,Sawmill Village,Summerville", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "A North Carolina real estate firm has that already owns two retail centers in the Charleston region has added a medical office building to its local portfolio.", "title": "Charlotte firm buys medical building in downtown Charleston", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151019/151019277/charlotte-firm-buys-medical-building-in-downtown-charleston", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/carbon/carbon-generic.png", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/carbon/carbon-generic.png"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "description": "A North Carolina real estate firm has that already owns two retail centers in the Charleston region has added a medical office building to its local portfolio.", "site": "@postandcourier", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Charlotte firm buys medical building in downtown Charleston"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151019277}}, "keywords": "Charlotte firm buys medical building in downtown Charleston , Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalReal Estate, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Charleston,Charlotte,Commercial real estate,Ferncroft Capital,Medical office buildings,Medical University of South Carolina,North Main Market,Sawmill Village,Summerville", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-19T13:08:54Z", "modified_time": "2015-10-19T13:08:00Z", "author": "John McDermott"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "A North Carolina real estate firm has that already owns two retail centers in the Charleston region has added a medical office building to its local portfolio."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda71d\"", "article_summary": "A North Carolina real estate firm has that already owns two retail centers in the Charleston region has added a medical office building to its local portfolio.\nMedical office buildings have become a hot commercial real estate asset.\nFerncroft said on its website that it has acquired more than 2 million square feet of real estate for more than $300 million since 2007.\nIt is Charlotte-based Ferncroft\u2019s third local commercial real estate acquisition.\nThe property, also known as the Calcote Building, was built in 2006 at Rutledge and Doughty streets."}
