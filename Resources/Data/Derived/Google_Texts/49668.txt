(CNSNews.com) - Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told “Fox News Sunday” that President Barack Obama is a “completely incompetent commander-in-chief” and that Secretary of State John Kerry is “completely delusional.”



“At the end of the day, Barack Obama has turned out to be a completely incompetent commander-in-chief. He doesn't listen to sound military advice. Leaving Iraq too soon led to the rise of ISIL, and John Kerry, his secretary of state, is a completely delusional man,” said Graham.





Obama declared two years ago that he would not put “boots on the ground in Syria” but last week, the administration announced that the U.S. would be sending in 50 Special Operations Forces into Syria without congressional authorization.

“Is that a lesson in don’t take any option off the table?” Fox News host John Roberts asked Graham.



“Yes, sir. It is,” said Graham. “My goal is to destroy ISIL, because if we don't hit them over there, they’re going to hit us here, and here’s what the president has done basically -- he has surrendered on two fronts. His goal of degrading and destroying ISIL, this strategy will not work.

“What we're about to accomplish is to turn Syria over to Russia and Iran, and to make sure that we never destroy ISIL on Obama's watch, and pass this mess on to the next president,” he said.
