Not to worry. Your religious beliefs may soon exclude you from adhering to a law that everyone else must follow. Not religious? Sorry, no special treatment for you. This is according to the Equitable Access to Care and Health (EACH) Act, H.R. 1814 that just passed the United States House of Representatives.\n\nThe Act would amend the Internal Revenue Code with the following:\n\n\u201cSuch term shall not include an individual for any month during a taxable year if such individual files a sworn statement, as part of the return of tax for the taxable year, that the individual was not covered under minimum essential coverage at any time during such taxable year and that the individual\u2019s sincerely held religious beliefs would cause the individual to object to medical health care that would be covered under such coverage.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr1814/text\n\nUnder this reasoning, why wouldn\u2019t \u201cfaith healing\u201d parents get away with allowing their sick children to suffer and die by not seeking proper medical treatment? Wouldn\u2019t they be exempt from their parental responsibilities because of \u201creligious freedom?\u201d\n\nA country with religious freedom is supposed to stand up for equal rights. Religious freedom is to protect the people from discrimination based on religious beliefs. But this term has been corrupted in the United States. It\u2019s being used to grant special privileges to religious people over non-religious people, or people of a specific faith over everyone else.\n\nThis certainly didn\u2019t start with H.R. 1814. The American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments of 1994, which did become law, allowed legal use of peyote for the Native American Church. \"the use, possession, or transportation of peyote by an Indian for bona fide traditional ceremony purposes in connection with the practice of a traditional Indian religion is lawful, and shall not be prohibited by the United States or any state. No Indian shall be penalized or discriminated against on the basis of such use, possession or transportation.\" https://erowid.org/freedom/civil_rights/religion/religion_airfaa.shtml\n\nThis is not religious freedom, this is religious entitlement. It\u2019s the allowance of one specific group of people to do something that\u2019s illegal for everyone else. Many may argue this isn\u2019t a big deal. Look at the Indian Removal Act that led to the Trail of Tears. Look at the massacres and land taking of the European settlers. Let them smoke some peyote for crying out loud!\n\nThe problem is, once you allow entitlements under the banner of freedom, a line forms of organizations looking for a hand out. You granted them a special privilege, why not us? We suffered too. Is it any wonder that religious organizations are spending hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying Congress? Religious entitlements creep in chipping away at the secular foundation of the country.\n\nForcing non-religious people and organizations to comply with rules and regulations that religious people and organizations are exempt from is not religious freedom, it\u2019s religious entitlement and bigotry. It\u2019s not equal rights, it\u2019s rights for some, but not for others. It\u2019s not fair and it\u2019s not right.\n\nIf a bill was proposed that granted special rights against criticism for non-believers, or any other special privilege, I\u2019d be against it. If someone suggested \u201cthere is no god\u201d be in the Pledge of Allegiance, I\u2019d be against it. I\u2019m not for special rights, I\u2019m for equal rights and I know many religious people feel the same way. I would hope that most religious people in the United States are too proud to beg or be politically persuaded by promises of special treatment.\n\nIn 1956 President Eisenhower signed a law declaring \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d to be the national motto of the United States. From the long standing \u201cWe the People\u201d and \u201cE pluribus unum\u201d (out of many, one), came a national motto that mirrors an Islamic theocracy. This was not progress.\n\nA country for all people that promotes individual rights and liberties is to be respected, protected and cherished. This requires fair legislation that doesn\u2019t grant special privileges to one group of law abiding citizens over others.\n\n-James Kirk Wall\n\nReference\n\nHouse OKs religious exemptions to having a healthcare plan \u2013 The Hill \u2013 Pete Kasperowicz\n\nReligious Exemption from Healthcare Law Overwhelmingly Passes the House\u2026 and That\u2019s Bad \u2013 Patheos \u2013 Paul Fidalgo\n\nPlease like my Facebook page at:\n\nJames Kirk Wall\n\nTo subscribe to this author, type your email address in the box and click the \"create subscription\" button.
