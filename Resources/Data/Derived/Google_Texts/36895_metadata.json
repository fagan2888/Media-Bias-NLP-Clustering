In recent years, Unilever has shed slow-growth food brands, including the Ragu and Bertolli pasta sauce lines, which it sold to food manufacturer Mizkan Group in 2014, and Slim-Fast, which was sold to Kainos Capital, also in 2014.\n\nDermatologist Howard Murad founded his namesake product line in Los Angeles in 1989. Murad's skin care products are meant to address concerns, including acne and aging. The washes, creams and toners are sold direct, through spas, and through retailers such as Sephora, Ulta and Nordstrom. The deal with Unilever should help Murad expand.\n\nThe London-based buyer supplies food, home and personal care products in more than 190 countries. Unliever's brands include Persil, Dove, Knorr, Domestos, Hellmann's, Lipton, Wall's, PG Tips, Ben & Jerry's, Marmite, Magbum and Lynx.\n\nCravath Swaine & Moore LLP advised Unilever on the deal.
