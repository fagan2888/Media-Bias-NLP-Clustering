Nested inside the soon-to-be renovated building were 50,000 bees.\n\nWes Wolken is a professional bee keeper, his job was to remove them all. \"[The homeowner] discovered that a large hive of bees was under the home,\" Wolken said, \"so I came out and inspected and confirmed the fact that there was a large hive of bees.\"\n\nWolken spent most of the afternoon Sunday removing the bees, in the process, finding a network of honeycomb that extended 18 feet long and almost 50 pounds of honey.\n\nAfter scooping out some of the honeycomb, Wolken powered up a special vacuum and started to remove the bees individually by sucking them into a special canister.\n\nThe bees will be relocated to an arboretum where they will stay until they are healthy enough to be placed in a new, permanent location.\n\nWes Wolken holds a class every year to train people on bee keeping. Anyone interested in taking this class should contact the Wichita Parks and Recreation department.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "An estimated 50,000 bees were removed from a home in north Wichita Sunday afternoon; the buzz is...they are moving to a better location", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "An estimated 50,000 bees were removed from a home in north Wichita Sunday afternoon; the buzz is...they are moving to a better location", "title": "50,000 bees removed from home in north Wichita", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/50000-bees-removed-from-home-in-north-Wichita-260614561.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/8E9/328/8E932890297A4442A9A6BABAB7CED080", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/055/2C7/0552C705C20E407C8229E9D611DB0950.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "An estimated 50,000 bees were removed from a home in north Wichita Sunday afternoon; the buzz is...they are moving to a better location", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/50000-bees-removed-from-home-in-north-Wichita-260614561.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Bee+Honey+1.jpg", "title": "50,000 bees removed from home in north Wichita", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "50,000 bees removed from home in north Wichita", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "50000, bees removed from home in"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5946\"", "article_summary": "\"[The homeowner] discovered that a large hive of bees was under the home,\" Wolken said, \"so I came out and inspected and confirmed the fact that there was a large hive of bees.\"\nAfter scooping out some of the honeycomb, Wolken powered up a special vacuum and started to remove the bees individually by sucking them into a special canister.\nA home in north Wichita has been the buzz of the neighborhood, literally.\nAnyone interested in taking this class should contact the Wichita Parks and Recreation department.\nNested inside the soon-to-be renovated building were 50,000 bees."}
