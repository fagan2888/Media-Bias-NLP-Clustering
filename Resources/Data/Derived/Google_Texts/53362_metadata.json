Fox\u2019s Teen Wolf and the end of a David Cronenberg film, the campaign is ostensibly meant to depict \u2014 through a series of 30-second video vignettes \u2014 the unmotivated sluggishness stereotypically seen among pot users in a lighthearted but ultimately sincere light. Though the campaign\u2019s website has been up since November, the videos were first released online this weekend.\n\nWhether it\u2019s the Tim Burton-inspired costume, the inherent silliness of watching a sloth attempt any action, or the strange implied morals (Smoking marijuana will somehow make you uncool at a teen party? Or bad at passing salt?), though, it\u2019s fair to say that the PSAs haven\u2019t quite hit home.\n\nWhere's the rest of the #stonersloth gang? Like 'Alcoholic Ant', 'Meth Meerkat' or 'Ectasy Eagle'? The whole crew needs their own show #420 \u2014 Jarryd Watson (@_ultramegaman_) December 20, 2015\n\nIt's here #stonersloth the t-shirt pic.twitter.com/h9S5zqvQOo \u2014 Eiza (noeL) Berage (@verbaliza) December 20, 2015\n\nKids are so mean!

Not sure where NSW Gov's ad guys found Chewbaccas siblings, but those videos are... Quite something. \u2014 Mike Baird (@mikebairdMP) December 19, 2015\n\nSimilarly, the National Cannabis Prevention and Information Centre (NCPIC), an Australian-based organization explicitly devoted to discouraging marijuana use among youths, issued a statement Saturday clarifying its role in crafting the ads after they were initially linked to it.\n\n\u201cWhile NCPIC is an evidence-based body, and is happy to support the NSW Government with information and recommendations at any time, in this case it has been unfortunately implied in media that the Centre's involvement was greater than it actually was,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWhile we wish the NSW Government luck in future cannabis campaigns, the current Stoner Sloth campaign doesn't reflect NCPIC views on how cannabis harms campaigns should be approached, as was implied by the media.\u201d\n\nPerhaps thankfully, the campaign won\u2019t be making its way to television screens anytime, according to the NSW Department of Premier and Cabinet.
