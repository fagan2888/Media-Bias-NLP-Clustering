And when I think about what I\u2019m fighting for, what gets me up every single day, that captures it just about as much as anything. Kindness; empathy \u2014 that sense that I have a stake in your success; that I\u2019m going to make sure, just because Malia and Sasha are doing well, that\u2019s not enough \u2014 I want your kids to do well also.

Especially when even the best-intended deeds have the worst consequences.\n\nIs it kind that millions of law-abiding, hard-working Americans who\u2019ve played by the rules and paid their bills are losing their health insurance because of ObamaCare mandates?\n\nIs it kind to leave Americans behind to die in Benghazi then later lie, repeatedly, about the cause of their death?\n\nIs it kind to leave Americans behind to be tortured in Iran even while making deals with their captors, deals that could lead to nuclear war?\n\nIs it kind to constantly treat your opponents as if they\u2019re motivated by nothing more than malice and the quest for power?\n\nIs it kind to force your own citizens to violate their most deeply-held beliefs by forcing them to purchase abortion pills?\n\nIs it kind when your administration treated certain classes of Americans as essentially enemies of the state, with the IRS hounding conservative groups, pro-life groups, and even adoptive parents through a campaign of persecution and unnecessary audits?\n\nPeggy Noonan\u2019s most recent Wall Street Journal post is especially insightful.
