Customers thought their U. of C. doctors would be covered all year long because the doctors were listed in Land of Lincoln's network directory when the customers bought plans during open enrollment in the public marketplace under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTrimming networks after enrollment season ends is not uncommon in Illinois and other states, highlighting glaring holes in state insurance regulations, consumer advocates say. In Illinois, rules don't prohibit health insurers from changing their networks after people enroll in either employer-sponsored or marketplace plans, forcing consumers to find new doctors or pay more of the bill if they receive care outside their network.\n\n\"There aren't a lot of standards across the states on how to handle a provider dropping out of a plan,\" said Claire McAndrew, private insurance program director at Families USA, a national health care consumer advocacy group. \"But that doesn't mean states can't put standards in place.\"\n\nLand of Lincoln customers still have time to switch insurance carriers on or before Jan. 31, the end of enrollment season under the Affordable Care Act. But their choices are limited. The University of Chicago's hospital and physicians group are in-network with only two other marketplace-based PPO plans, Coventry Health Care of Illinois and Harken Health.\n\nConcerns about the availability of health care providers in medical plans have been around since before the Affordable Care Act. But they are amplified since adoption of the law in 2010 because limited networks are a feature of many insurance policies offered in the public marketplaces. Such \"narrow networks,\" consumers say, restrict their choices for specialized care for themselves and their children.\n\nThe ACA included a provision requiring insurers to maintain an \"adequate network,\" one large enough to ensure patients have access to a sufficiently broad range of providers and can get appointments within a reasonable time. Health plans are also required to check their provider directories at least once a month for accuracy.\n\nBut there's no requirement that a consumer be guaranteed a specific provider throughout the year. Since the dawn of managed care, insurers have enjoyed great freedom in devising networks as a means of controlling costs or coordinating health care services.\n\nLast year, Humana dropped University of Chicago Medicine from its network, ending a 20-year relationship. In 2013, UnitedHealthcare dropped thousands of doctors in Connecticut and nine other states from its Medicare networks.\n\nNetwork participation is a two-way street between insurers and providers. Negotiating and establishing a network relationship is not a one-time event but rather an ongoing and continuous effort. Both parties have financial incentives to maintain a stable relationship once one has been established. Conflicts that result in contract terminations can harm their reputations.\n\nEven consumer advocates agree that balancing the interests of insurers, providers and consumers is tricky for policymakers. States remain the primary regulators of insurance, despite new standards in the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"What insurers will tell you is that providers come in and out of their networks throughout the year, so states shouldn't require them to be locked in to a specific provider for a full calendar year,\" said Sabrina Corlette, consumer advocate and professor at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute.\n\nBut when a large health system is dropped from a network during the year, consumers feel misled. Cheryl Mostowski, 61, of suburban Algonquin said she bought a Land of Lincoln plan so she could go to the University of Chicago. She sees specialists at the Hyde Park-based medical center to treat an autoimmune disease.\n\n\"They're the ones who specialize in systemic lupus,\" Mostowski said. \"When I go to doctors in the suburbs, they don't have a clue.\"\n\nJudging by social media, customers are more upset at Land of Lincoln than at the University of Chicago for the breakdown in contract negotiations. One wrote on the insurer's Facebook page, \"You will not remain in business very long by treating customers in this manner.\"\n\nLand of Lincoln, a federally funded startup, faces financial difficulties after millions of dollars in promised government aid wasn't delivered. In response to questions about changes in its network, company spokesman Dennis O'Sullivan said the insurer \"is constantly working to expand its network of providers and also keep premiums competitive. As a result, networks can sometimes change, as health care provider contracts are constantly being negotiated for the most competitive rates for services provided.\"\n\nLand of Lincoln members who are undergoing treatment may be eligible, under state law, to continue care at the University of Chicago at in-network rates for up to 90 days. Any pregnant woman in her second or third trimester, for instance, may be allowed to deliver at the medical center, the insurance company said.\n\nThe Illinois Insurance Department is reviewing Land of Lincoln's decision to drop the University of Chicago from its network to ensure compliance with network adequacy regulations as well as rules that address consumer \"misinformation,\" spokeswoman Alissandra Calderon said. The department's acting director, Anne Melissa Dowling, declined to be interviewed.\n\nA few states have moved to protect consumers from financial harm when providers abruptly leave networks or insurance companies inaccurately list doctors in their directories who no longer accept coverage. In Washington state, for instance, new rules went into effect this year that require insurers to notify the insurance department of a potential contract termination with a provider that could affect access to care.\n\nMcAndrew of Families USA applauded the new state regulations.\n\n\"It can be very challenging for consumers when insurance companies and providers are struggling over issues such as reimbursement rates,\" she said. \"Consumers usually are not privy to such information.\"", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Consumers caught in the middle of insurers, hospital payment disputes", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Some Chicago-area consumers were surprised to learn this month that insurance companies can at any time limit their access to doctors and hospitals in health plans.", "title": "Consumers caught in the middle of insurers, hospital payment disputes", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-insurance-network-regulation-0129-biz-20160128-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56a96432/turbine/ct-insurance-network-regulation-0129-biz-20160128", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp03.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Land of Lincoln Health, University of Chicago Medical Center, Health insurance, Provider networks,", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/85714988", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-01-28", "Description": "Land of Lincoln's dropping of University of Chicago from network illustrates hole in consumer protections.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Land of Lincoln Health, University of Chicago Medical Center, Health insurance, Provider networks,"}, "article_summary": "Concerns about the availability of health care providers in medical plans have been around since before the Affordable Care Act.\nEven consumer advocates agree that balancing the interests of insurers, providers and consumers is tricky for policymakers.\nSince the dawn of managed care, insurers have enjoyed great freedom in devising networks as a means of controlling costs or coordinating health care services.\nThe University of Chicago's hospital and physicians group are in-network with only two other marketplace-based PPO plans, Coventry Health Care of Illinois and Harken Health.\nSuch \"narrow networks,\" consumers say, restrict their choices for specialized care for themselves and their children."}
