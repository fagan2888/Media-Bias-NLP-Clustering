House of Cards’ Frank Underwood may be fictional, but his love of video games is probably based off of a few real-life lawmakers.

In an interview Thursday morning at POLITICO’s Playbook breakfast, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz admitted to his love of virtual games. “On my iPhone, I think I’m on level 217 on Candy Crush,” Cruz said.

Cruz added that he was addicted in general to his phone, which he uses mainly for games and Twitter. “If there were one thing my wife could throw out the window permanently, it’d be my iPhone.”

Cruz isn’t the only senator who can’t keep his hands off his phone. Sen. John McCain was famously caught playing poker on his iPhone back in September during a hearing about Syria.
