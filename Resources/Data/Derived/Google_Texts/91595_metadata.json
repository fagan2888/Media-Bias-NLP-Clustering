In the so-called Scopes Monkey Trial, Scopes was convicted, but the evolution vs. creationism debate wasn\u2019t formally settled until 1968, when the Supreme Court backed Scopes. Several 2016 Republican presidential candidates, however, think the Warren Court got it wrong, and Dr. Ben Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, put it in writing: \u201cI find it as hard to accept the claims of evolution as it is to think that a hurricane blowing through a junkyard could somehow assemble a fully equipped and flight-ready 747.\u201d Here is your Three-Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in a fraction of the time that it takes to read the graphic-novel version of \u201cOn the Origin of Species\u201d:\n\nRoad Trip: Eight days on the job, Loretta Lynch goes to Baltimore to meet with authorities in the wake of the Freddie Gray riots and the arrest of six Charm City police officers charged in connection with his death. Though the violence has subsided, police and residents are still on edge: When cops chased a man with a gun and a weapon was discharged on Monday, word swept through the neighborhood and on Twitter that the officers had shot him, which wasn\u2019t true.\n\nGood Luck, Huck: The GOP presidential field is getting even bigger, as Mike Huckabee \u2013 former Arkansas governor, former Fox News host and former 2008 presidential candidate \u2013 reportedly will throw his hat into the cluttered ring with an announcement Tuesday. It\u2019s the triumph of hope over experience, though: Propelled largely by evangelical Christians, Huck, an ordained Baptist minister, started strong in \u201808, but Sen. John McCain passed him in the backstretch, then went on to get crushed by President Barack Obama in the general election.\n\n[READ: Conservatives See Baltimore as Proof Welfare Fails]\n\nWho?: Still, with one presidential run under his belt, Huck\u2019s likely to fare much better than Jim Gilmore, the former Virginia governor who, for some reason, is testing the Republican presidential waters, even though he\u2019s on nobody\u2019s radar. When last seen on the campaign trail, Gilmore was digging out from a 31-point landslide loss to Mark Warner, a Democrat and fellow former Virginia governor whom Gilmore challenged for the state\u2019s then-open Senate seat.\n\nDeep Thoughts: Besides using them to heal children, kindly ol\u2019 Doc Carson often puts his Gifted Hands on the keyboard. He\u2019s written several books, ranging from politics to advice for teens to the philosophy of risk-taking. Most of them include some of his more, shall we say, unorthodox, colorful views (see above), ranging from fighting space aliens to why homosexuality triggered the fall of ancient Rome and how legalized abortion proves NFL star Michael Vick isn\u2019t guilty of abusing animals in a dogfighting ring.\n\nKnow When to Hold \u2018Em: As a woman in a male-dominated world \u2013 a tech industry CEO \u2013 Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina says she ran with the big boys without using \u201cthe gender card\u201d as her trump. But if the fates align and she finds herself running against Hillary Clinton for the presidency, Slate writes, Fiorina\u2019s gonna put all those gender cards on the table: \u201cShe won't be able to talk about being the first woman president. She won't be able to talk about a war on women without being challenged. She won't be able to play the gender card,\u201d they quote her as saying. Because Fiorina will play it for her. Or something.\n\n[ALSO: Hillary Clinton Looms Large in Carly Fiorina's Presidential Bid]\n\nToday in Hillary: Ahead of the release of the book, \u201cClinton Cash,\u201d which comes out today and purportedly details shady dealings between the Clintons and overseas donors to their charity, Clinton 2016 announced The Briefing (catchy name), a Web- and social media-based rapid-response shop to spin negative info about the world\u2019s most powerful grandparents and the bad headlines that pop up around them like dandelions after a spring rain. They\u2019re likely to get a lot of work: Clinton\u2019s agreed to testify before yet another set of hearings on Benghazi, but just once.\n\nToday in Obama: The president is expected to nominate Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr., the Marine Corps commandant, to replace Army Gen. Martin Dempsey as Joint Chiefs chairman. Later, Obama will host a Cinco de Mayo reception in the White House.\n\nMoney Talks: A new campaign is afoot to redesign the $20 bill and give it a new face \u2013 a woman from American history. The effort to put someone like Eleanor Roosevelt or Rosa Parks on the sawbuck has been around for awhile, but it gained traction when Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire introduced a bill which would move the process along to a citizen committee, a step closer to convincing the Treasury Department to make the change.\n\nYour Morning Video: Ben Carson, M. Deity:\n\nDuly Noted: On this date in 1862, Mexican troops defeated French occupying forces in the Battle of Puebla, a victory now honored by sombreros and lots of tequila on Cinco de Mayo. What's believed to be America's first train robbery took place in 1865 as a band of criminals derailed a St. Louis-bound train near North Bend, Ohio; they robbed the passengers and looted safes on board before escaping. In 1934, the first Three Stooges short for Columbia Pictures, \"Woman Haters,\" was released. Astronaut Alan B. Shepard Jr. in 1961 became America's first space traveler as he made a 15-minute suborbital flight aboard Mercury capsule Freedom 7. In 1973, Secretariat won the Kentucky Derby, the first of its Triple Crown victories. The Irish Republican Army hunger-striker Bobby Sands in 1981 died at the Maze Prison in Northern Ireland in his 66th day without food.\n\nHappy Birthday, Taureans: Actress Pat Carroll (88), former AFL-CIO President John J.
