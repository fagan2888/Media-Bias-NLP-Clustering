That\u2019s where The Onion fits right into our outreach strategy,\u201d Jennifer Koehler, executive director of Get Covered Illinois said in a news release.\n\nNeither Koehler nor anyone at Get Covered Illinois responded to Illinois Watchdog\u2019s request for an interview.\n\nKoehler\u2019s statement said the partnership will focus on fake headlines and fake news stories about someone forced to sell their action figures to pay medical bills.\n\nBut on a site already filled with fake stories about non-committal cult members and lamenting rhinoceroses, state Sen. Dave Syverson, R-Rockford, worries Illinois\u2019 funny ads won\u2019t land.\n\n\u201cYou always have to be careful when you\u2019re advertising on the Onion,\u201d Syverson told Illinois Watchdog. \u201cBecause readers don\u2019t always know if that\u2019s a joke ad or a legitimate ad.\u201d\n\nSyverson said it\u2019s clear the ad agency doesn\u2019t understand Obamacare.\n\n\u201cConsumers aren\u2019t stupid,\u201d Syverson said. \u201cThe reason Obamacare is not having success is because the coverage is very poor, the benefits are very poor and the cost is very expensive.\u201d\n\nIllinois\u2019 last round of Obamacare enrollment numbers showed just 61,000 people selected an insurance plan, and it\u2019s unclear on how many actually bought a plan.\n\nSyverson said few of those people are the \u201cuninsured\u201d Obamacare was supposed to help.\n\n\u201cBetween 70 percent and 75 percent of those who have been enrolled since this program began in October were people that were previously covered,\u201d Syverson explained. \u201cPeople who were on (Illinois\u2019 state based high risk insurance) or people who had private health policies, that now that the federal government is offering a subsidy, they just switched.\u201d\n\nIllinois has added almost 150,000 people to Medicaid, because of Obamacare.\n\nBut the state hasn\u2019t added enough young and healthy people to pay for the older and sicker people already enrolled.\n\n\u201cGet Covered Illinois understands their target demographic and is taking a creative approach to tailor a message to that audience that goes beyond traditional marketing,\u201d Mike McAvoy, President of Onion Inc., said in the state\u2019s news release.\n\nIllinois has been using $30 million from the federal government to do anything it can to sell Obamacare. Remember the Day of the Dead sales pitch?\n\nThe new Onion ads will start soon and ramp up as the March 31 deadline for coverage draws closer.\n\nYou can contact Benjamin Yount at Ben@IllinoisWatchdog.org and find him on Twitter @BenYount.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Illinois is turning to the Onion, and action figures, to try and get people to sign up for Obamacare.", "title": "Illinois hoping jokes can sell Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/02/onion.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-02-11T07:41:44+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/128144/must-joking-il-partners-onion-push-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Illinois", "tag": "action figures,Dave Syverson,Illinois,jokes,not funny,ObamaCare,Obamavare doesn't work,sales pitch,the Onion,waste of time", "published_time": "2014-02-11T07:10:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-11T07:41:44+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Illinois is turning to the Onion, and action figures, to try and get people to sign up for Obamacare.", "title": "Illinois hoping jokes can sell Obamacare", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/02/insert-joke-here.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Illinois is turning to the Onion, and action figures, to try and get people to sign up for Obamacare."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd911f\"", "article_summary": "By Benjamin Yount | Illinois WatchdogSPRINGFIELD, Ill. \u2014 Illinois is turning it\u2019s Obamacare sales pitch into a joke.\nNeither Koehler nor anyone at Get Covered Illinois responded to Illinois Watchdog\u2019s request for an interview.\nThe new Onion ads will start soon and ramp up as the March 31 deadline for coverage draws closer.\nThat\u2019s where The Onion fits right into our outreach strategy,\u201d Jennifer Koehler, executive director of Get Covered Illinois said in a news release.\n\u201cYou always have to be careful when you\u2019re advertising on the Onion,\u201d Syverson told Illinois Watchdog."}
