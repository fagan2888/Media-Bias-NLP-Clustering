Hirono of her visit to Moloka\u02bbi Middle School on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt was a terrific showing of enthusiastic, smart, young kids. It gave me a lot of hope,\u201d she said.\n\nMoloka\u02bbi Middle School was ranked in the continuous improvement category in the state\u2019s new report card with math proficiency at 62%, and reading proficiency at 64%.\n\nOn Wednesday, Senator Hirono visited the newly constructed Veterans Resource Center at the University of Hawai\u02bbi Maui College campus.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a physical space there which really was the result of a lot of people coming together in the community \u2014 Home Depot gave money, lots of volunteers put sweat equity in there,\u201d Hirono said to Maui Now.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of veterans who have come back, they\u2019re on the GI Bill \u2014 It\u2019s a whole different thing for them to maneuver the civilian environment after being in the military for however long they\u2019ve been. I met with some of the veterans today and they said it really makes a difference that they have other veterans who have had similar experiences to them to talk to,\u201d said Hirono.\n\nAfter visiting with student veterans, Senator Hirono headed to East Maui, where she attended a dedication ceremony for a new education program in the K\u012bpahulu District of Haleakal\u0101 National Park.\n\nAccording to Hirono, the park unveiled a new cultural brochure that was created with the help of many k\u016bpuna in the community.\n\nShe said its sensitivity to the Hawaiian culture will \u201cenable visitors to understand the importance of Haleakal\u0101 to the Hawaiian community, and to all of us.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDuring a visit to Maui Now\u2019s offices, Senator Hirono provided us with a legislative update including input on our questions about Obamacare and the infamous October government shutdown.\n\nOn Obamacare, Senator Hirono said, \u201cI think we need to keep in mind how important that law is in keeping costs down for seniors. The seniors in Hawai\u02bbi have saved $35 billion on lower prescription drug costs thanks to Obamacare; and then we have young people who are able to stay on their parent\u2019s policies until they are 26 years old. So, there are a lot of really good, positive parts to Obamacare.\u201d\n\nIn response to criticism about the Obamacare website, Senator Hirono said, \u201cYes, we were all disappointed in the website, but it is getting fixed, and as the days go by it will get better and better, and people are going to be able to sign on.\u201d\n\nShe continue saying, \u201cMeanwhile, the underlying law is very important. Those who continue to say we should eliminate and repeal Obamacare are not paying attention to the millions of people who are already being helped by its provisions.\u201d\n\nOn the topic of the two-week federal government shutdown that resulted from a lapse in appropriations, Hirono said, \u201cWhat we learned was, I think all across the country people realize that we rely on government for a lot of things: our national parks being open \u2014 Haleakal\u0101, Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park, Pearl Harbor \u2014 all of these. Government services are really important,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Hirono, the shutdown cost the country $24 billion and affected several Hawai\u02bbi businesses directly.\n\n\u201cOur commissaries shut down, and the people who provide the produce to the commissaries \u2014 I met with them \u2014 they lost hundreds of thousands of dollars during that shutdown, and money that they are not going to be able to make back. This caused our people a lot of pain,\u201d said Senator Hirono.\n\nShe continued, \u201cit is not the way to debate the differences we have on issues\u2026 we\u2019re going to move forward; we Democrats can\u2019t just do it all by ourselves. As much as we may want to, it requires people to say we\u2019re going to behave in a way that\u2019s going to help our country.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Senator Hirono said there is a farm bill and a budget conference coming up.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that we are going to deal with the budget and appropriations in a way that\u2019s not going to hurt our county the way our shutdown did, and that next year we\u2019ll move forward to comprehensive immigration reform \u2014 which is another critical issue for our country,\u201d she said.\n\nTomorrow, Senator Hirono will meet with members of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Hawai\u02bbi and celebrate the season with families at the East Hawai\u02bbi Children\u2019s Justice Center. She plans to will wrap up her trip at the solemn commemoration of Pearl Harbor Day during a Saturday morning ceremony marking the 72nd anniversary of the event.", "article_metadata": {"expires": 0, "description": "US Senator Mazie Hirono made several stops on Maui and Moloka\u02bbi this week as part of a statewide visit to meet with constituents and participate in cultural,", "og": {"url": "http://mauinow.com/2013/12/05/hirono-makes-maui-rounds-visits-kipahulu-and-moloka%ca%bbi/", "type": "article", "image": "http://mauinow.com/files/2013/12/mazie-hirono-Joined-at-the-Kipahulu-dedication-by-renowned-kumu-hula-Gordean-Lee-Bailey-a-true-living-treasure-of-Hawaii.jpg", "site_name": "Maui Now  |  Hirono Makes Maui Rounds: Visits K\u012bpahulu and Moloka\u02bbi", "title": "Maui Now: Hirono Makes Maui Rounds: Visits K\u012bpahulu and Moloka\u02bbi"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f01d4f", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "theme-color": "#57ace2", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://mauinow.com/wp-content/themes/MauiNow2015/library/images/win8-tile-icon.png", "keywords": "mazie hirono,mazie hirono maui,mazie hirono molokai,mazie hirono pearl harbor,obamacare,government shutdown,maui news", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "During her Maui stop, Senator Hirono met with diverse students, including those from Moloka\u02bbi Middle School, student-veterans at Maui College, and DREAM Act students on Maui.\nOn Wednesday, Senator Hirono visited the newly constructed Veterans Resource Center at the University of Hawai\u02bbi Maui College campus.\nOn Obamacare, Senator Hirono said, \u201cI think we need to keep in mind how important that law is in keeping costs down for seniors.\nAfter visiting with student veterans, Senator Hirono headed to East Maui, where she attended a dedication ceremony for a new education program in the K\u012bpahulu District of Haleakal\u0101 National Park.\nTomorrow, Senator Hirono will meet with members of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation Hawai\u02bbi and celebrate the season with families at the East Hawai\u02bbi Children\u2019s Justice Center."}
