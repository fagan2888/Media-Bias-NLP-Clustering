Patrick Leahy of Vermont \u2014 the sole Democratic senator serving the people of Vermont.\n\nSupporters of the senator describe him as a leader in defending Americans\u2019 civil rights and liberties and point out that Leahy was one of only 22 U.S. senators who voted against the Iraq War in 2002. But although Leahy may be more progressive in his stance on some issues such as marijuana, privacy, education and the environment, the senator\u2019s stance on some issues \u2014 such as Internet freedoms \u2014 leaves many liberals cringing.\n\nAs chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Leahy held a hearing earlier this year regarding the \u201cConflicts Between State and Federal Marijuana Laws,\u201d and has pushed a piece of legislation that would allow states to decide for themselves whether or not they wanted to legalize marijuana.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nWhile Leahy\u2019s home state of Vermont has not legalized marijuana for either medical or recreational use, the senator called for the hearing last month and said he believes state laws legalizing marijuana for adult or medical use \u201cshould be respected\u201d by the federal government.\n\nIn an interview with the Atlantic in September, Leahy, a former prosecutor, said, \u201cI\u2019ve long urged the federal government to stay away from states where they have legalized the use of marijuana, or legalized medical marijuana, and the reason I am holding my hearings is to get a very clear understanding of what they want to do.\n\n\u201cWe only have so many resources for law enforcement and \u2026 to waste time on these minor marijuana measures or waste time on marijuana in states where it is legal makes absolutely no sense.\u201d\n\nThough Vermont has yet to legalize marijuana, the state has legalized hemp. Since there is also a federal ban on hemp, some lawmakers have pushed for the nullification of the federal ban on marijuana\u2019s cannabis-spawned cousin. However, Leahy has not been the most vocal supporter of hemp legalization efforts nationally or in the state.\n\nHowever, Kevin Sabet, director of the Drug Policy Institute, has expressed concerns about Leahy\u2019s plan to legalize marijuana, cautioning the senator to consider the effects legalization would have on a variety of issues ranging from children\u2019s health to foreign relations.\n\n\u201cAnyone who has been to Colorado since 2009 can get a sense of what full legalization looks like already. Mass advertising, promotion, using items that are attractive to kids \u2013 like \u2018medical marijuana lollipops,\u2019 \u2018Ring Pots,\u2019 \u2018Pot-Tarts\u2019 etc. \u2013 are all characteristics of current policy,\u201d Sabet said. \u201cWhat has been the result of this de facto legalization for kids? For one, drug-related referrals for high school students testing positive for marijuana have increased.\u201d\n\nHistoric and progressive legislation\n\nIn addition to pushing for marijuana legalization, Leahy has worked with other senators, such as Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), to author the Justice Safety Valve Act, which would allow judges to issue a sentence below the current \u201cmandatory minimums.\u201d\n\nLeahy also made history this fall when he held another Senate Judiciary Committee meeting to discuss a piece of legislation that determines whether or not a person is a journalist, in a bill designed by Congress to give federal protection to journalists from being forced to disclose the identities of their confidential sources.\n\nBut the legislation, the Free Flow of Information Act of 2013, comes with a catch. In order for a person to be protected under the bill, one must first meet the criteria for being termed a \u201cjournalist\u201d \u2014 and even then, journalists will not be protected in all situations.\n\nThough freedom of speech \u2014 which includes the printed word \u2014 is protected under the First Amendment, media shield laws are supposed to go above and beyond in terms of protecting a journalist from being forced to disclose confidential information and sources.\n\nLeahy said he was in favor of the legislation because, as he put it, \u201cone of the things that protect democracy is the free flow of information,\u201d adding that the public learned valuable information about the NSA after Edward Snowden released classified documents earlier this year.\n\nMost recently, Leahy has made a name for himself when he announced he had co-authored a piece of legislation along with Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-Wisc.) that would \u201crestore Americans\u2019 privacy rights by ending the government\u2019s dragnet collection of phone records and requiring greater oversight, transparency, and accountability with respect to domestic surveillance authorities.\u201d\n\nKnown as the USA FREEDOM Act, the legislation would \u201cend the dragnet collection of Americans\u2019 phone records under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act \u2014 which allows the FBI to order any person or entity to hand over any tangible item to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities \u2014 and ensures that other authorities cannot be used to justify similar dragnet collection.\u201d\n\nWhat is unique about this bill is that Leahy and Sensenbrenner were both primary authors of the Patriot Act, the piece of legislation that the Freedom Act seeks to alter.\n\nOn Nov. 6, the senator announced in a press release that the Senate Judiciary Committee would hold a third oversight hearing on the government\u2019s use of surveillance authorities later this month, on Nov. 20.\n\n\u201cThe intelligence community faces a trust deficit, and I am particularly concerned that the NSA has strayed and overreached beyond its core missions,\u201d Leahy said in a statement.\n\n\u201cOne important step toward rebuilding that trust would be for the NSA to spend less of its time collecting data on innocent Americans, and more on keeping our nation\u2019s secrets safe and holding its own accountable.\u201d\n\nHowever, in an opinion piece for Politico, Leahy noted that Congress has to have some surveillance practices in order to keep the country safe.\n\nPledge to defend Hollywood\n\nThough Leahy has caught the attention of the American public most recently for his popular stance on some issues, the senator also has received flack for his stance on online piracy issues and related support for the SOPA and PIPA legislation.\n\nIn 2011, Leahy introduced the Protect IP Act, which sought to \u201cprotect the investment American companies make in developing brands and creating content and will protect the jobs associated with those investments.\u201d\n\nThe bill would have given the Department of Justice the ability to bring down foreign websites \u201cdedicated to infringement\u201d without first having a trial or a hearing, since the law didn\u2019t require the judge hear any defense from a website\u2019s operator.\n\nUnder Leahy\u2019s bill, the government would have had no obligation to even pretend to be proceeding toward a trial in order to keep a site suppressed indefinitely.\n\n\u201cCan the government be trusted to get this stuff right?\u201d said Andrew Bridges, a lawyer with Fenwick & West. \u201cI think the obvious answer is no. There\u2019s a reason why we have trials.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Huffington Post, Leahy is currently Hollywood\u2019s favorite Washington lawmaker, while according to data compiled by Center for Responsive Politics, two of Leahy\u2019s biggest campaign contributors are Time Warner and Disney.\n\n\u201cHollywood and the recording industry have a one-item agenda. You can\u2019t say to them, \u2018If you go softer on this, I\u2019ll give you that,\u2019 because there\u2019s no \u2018that\u2019 for them,\u201d said Gigi Sohn, president and co-founder of Public Knowledge, a leading nonprofit on Internet freedom issues and a staunch opponent of SOPA.\n\nHollywood has such an affinity for Leahy that Time Warner has even given him cameo appearances in Batman movies.\n\nLeahy spokesman David Carle defended the senator\u2019s film career, saying that \u201cBatman\u2019s connection to Vermont is a great thing that spans many years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Batman character has been one of Patrick Leahy\u2019s lifelong passions, and it has spawned and energized an enduring bond to Vermont. By now this legacy includes collaboration with his crusade against landmines and helping to protect children in conflict zones, as well as ongoing help for the children\u2019s library where he developed a lifelong love of reading.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is the Democratic senator from Vermont really as progressive as he\u2019s cracked up to be?, civil liberties, Edward Snowden, hemp, Journalism, marijuana legalization, nsa, online privacy, Patrick Leahy, SOPA, Vermont,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Katie Rucke", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Is the Democratic senator from Vermont really as progressive as he\u2019s cracked up to be?, civil liberties, Edward Snowden, hemp, Journalism, marijuana legalization, nsa, online privacy, Patrick Leahy, SOPA, Vermont,", "title": "Patrick Leahy: Pot\u2019s Savior And Hollywood\u2019s Hero", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/patrick-leahy/172366/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/P16x919-690x388.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-11T08:28:39-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Is the Democratic senator from Vermont really as progressive as he\u2019s cracked up to be?, civil liberties, Edward Snowden, hemp, Journalism, marijuana legalization, nsa, online privacy, Patrick Leahy, SOPA, Vermont,", "title": "Patrick Leahy: Pot\u2019s Savior And Hollywood\u2019s Hero", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/P4x314.jpg", "creator": "@katierucke", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Front Page: Inside Stories", "tag": "Vermont", "published_time": "2013-11-09T05:00:22-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-11T08:28:39-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde749\"", "article_summary": "Patrick Leahy: Pot\u2019s Savior And Hollywood\u2019s HeroIs the Democratic senator from Vermont really as progressive as he\u2019s cracked up to be?\nMass advertising, promotion, using items that are attractive to kids \u2013 like \u2018medical marijuana lollipops,\u2019 \u2018Ring Pots,\u2019 \u2018Pot-Tarts\u2019 etc.\nHollywood has such an affinity for Leahy that Time Warner has even given him cameo appearances in Batman movies.\nHowever, Leahy has not been the most vocal supporter of hemp legalization efforts nationally or in the state.\nSince there is also a federal ban on hemp, some lawmakers have pushed for the nullification of the federal ban on marijuana\u2019s cannabis-spawned cousin."}
