This time the House Minority Leader made an incoherent appearance on \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher.\u201d\n\nSo Democrats, who have singlehandedly decimated any shred of hope for America\u2019s future, see themselves as \u201cmessengers of hope,\u201d and according to Nancy, \u201cmessengers of hope\u201d are what Democrats will \u201ccontinue to be.\u201d So Democrats, who have singlehandedly decimated any shred of hope for America\u2019s future, see themselves as \u201cmessengers of hope,\u201d and according to Nancy, \u201cmessengers of hope\u201d are what Democrats will \u201ccontinue to be.\u201d\n\nOh please! When Nancy Pelosi says \u201chope,\u201d does she mean \u201cHope and Change\u201d-style hope? Because if that\u2019s what the aging septuagenarian is peddling, God help us all.\n\nIt\u2019s funny to hear Nancy Pelosi project onto Republicans the very thing she is, which is a fear peddler.\n\nThis is the woman who, in the run-up to the failed stimulus bill, sounded an alarm to warn Americans that \u201cEvery week we don\u2019t pass a Stimulus package, 500 million Americans lose their jobs.\u201d\n\nBesides being the person who, at the time, was second in line to the presidency adding another 200 million people to America\u2019s census figures, Pelosi the Prophet apparently didn\u2019t foresee at the time that six years after Obama\u2019s \u201cshovel ready\u201d job-creating fiasco was passed, 92 million people, or approximately half of America\u2019s working-age population, would be not working.\n\nNot to mention the fear mongering that drove the rhetoric prior to the passage of the Affordable Health Care Act. And speaking of healthcare reform, what exactly was the woman with the oversized gavel selling when she said that if the Republican\u2019s \u201cProtect Life Act\u201d prevented Obamacare abortion funding pregnant \u2018women [would] die on the floor?\u2019\n\nIt was also Nancy Pelosi, San Francisco\u2019s very own harbinger of hope, who warned America that if the House passed a bill that extended a federal pay freeze, it would \u201cundermine the dignity\u201d of a job that is, quite frankly, anything but dignified.\n\nSpeaking of federal workers, during the impending government shutdown of 2013 Ms. Nancy warned there would be a \u201cstrong negative\u201d response from Democrats if Republicans didn\u2019t comply with \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Democrats.\n\nThen, after the ruling that employers with religious objections could elect not to offer birth control as part of a company\u2019s health care package, it was none other than anti-fear-mongering Nancy who warned Americans that they should \u201cbe afraid\u201d of the Supreme Court.\n\nDevout Roman Catholic that she is, Nancy Pelosi even felt it was incumbent upon her to write San Francisco\u2019s Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone to ask him not to attend the Washington D.C. pro-tradition March for Marriage event this past June 14th. Always the upbeat optimist, Nancy described the gathering as \u201cvenom masquerading as virtue.\u201d\n\nHow Foot-in-Mouth Pelosi can say that Democrats are not \u201cfear mongers\u201d in the same breath as saying that \u201cCivilization as we know it today would be in jeopardy if the Republicans win the Senate\u201d does illustrate a level of cluelessness on Nancy\u2019s part that is quite impressive.\n\nBut then on second thought, maybe Pelosi\u2019s statement was actually positive, because after what Mrs. Pelosi and her Capitol Hill cronies have done to \u201ccivilization as we know it, a Republican Senate jeopardizing the current state of Democrat-crafted civilization is truly a hopeful prospect.\n\nJeannie hosts a blog at www.jeannie-ology.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/09/fearmonger_nancy_pelosi_and_civilization_as_we_know_it.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2014-09/193129_5_.png", "title": "Blog: Fear-Monger Nancy Pelosi and Civilization as We Know It"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8a5c\"", "article_summary": "When Nancy Pelosi says \u201chope,\u201d does she mean \u201cHope and Change\u201d-style hope?\nIt\u2019s funny to hear Nancy Pelosi project onto Republicans the very thing she is, which is a fear peddler.\nDevout Roman Catholic that she is, Nancy Pelosi even felt it was incumbent upon her to write San Francisco\u2019s Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone to ask him not to attend the Washington D.C. pro-tradition March for Marriage event this past June 14th.\nNot to mention the fear mongering that drove the rhetoric prior to the passage of the Affordable Health Care Act.\nBut then on second thought, maybe Pelosi\u2019s statement was actually positive, because after what Mrs. Pelosi and her Capitol Hill cronies have done to \u201ccivilization as we know it, a Republican Senate jeopardizing the current state of Democrat-crafted civilization is truly a hopeful prospect."}
