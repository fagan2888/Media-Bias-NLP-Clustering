Huron-Backed Coffee Maker Ronnoco Perks Up with Addition of U.S. Roasterie Assets

This is Ronnoco's fifth acquisition since Huron bought the company in 2012

Huron Capital Partners is revving up portfolio company Ronnoco Coffee LLC with another acquisition.

The Detroit private equity firm has acquired the assets of Des Moines, Iowa-based U.S. Roasterie Inc., a private-label coffee manufacturer. The company's coffee is sold to the office, food services and convenience store channels. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

This is the fifth acquisition Ronnoco has made under Huron's ownership. Huron invested in the company in July 2012. The coffee maker has also acquired International Blends, Henderson Coffee, Love Bottling and Biff's Coffee Roasting.

Other companies have also made coffee-related acquisitions recently. In November, Cott Corp. agreed to buy DSS Group Inc. to expand into coffee. In August, coffee house Peet's Coffee & Tea Inc. agreed to buy Mighty Leaf Tea. Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) won Mergers & Acquisitions M&A Mid-Market Deal of the Year Award for its acquisition of Teavana in 2012.
