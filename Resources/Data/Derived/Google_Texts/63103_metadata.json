The five guys who start determining what contraceptions are legal. Let\u2019s not even go there.\u201d\n\n\u2014 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), at her weekly news conference, on July 10\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s 5-to-4 ruling that, as a closely held company, Hobby Lobby was not required to pay for all of the birth-control procedures mandated by the Affordable Care Act, Democrats have rushed to condemn the court. But in some cases the rhetoric has gotten way ahead of the facts.\n\nHere\u2019s a round-up of some of the more noteworthy claims. In some cases, lawmakers concede that they make a mistake; in others, they are argue that they are offering what amounts to opinion, even though the assertion was stated as fact.\n\nStatements on Supreme Court cases are notoriously difficult to fact check because rulings are open to interpretation \u2013 and the full impact is often difficult to judge until lower courts begin to react to the ruling. Both Democrats and Republicans use adverse Supreme Court rulings to rally their respective bases, but lawmakers have a responsibility not to succumb to overheated and inaccurate rhetoric.\n\nNothing in the ruling allows a company to stop a woman from getting or filling a prescription for contraceptives, but that salient fact is often lost as lawmakers jump to conclusions that the cost will be prohibitive. That may or may not be the case depending on circumstances. Moreover, it is worth remembering that when the Affordable Care Act was passed, 28 states already had laws or regulations that promote insurance coverage for contraception. The law sought to extend that across the country \u2014 and even with this ruling, that will remain the case for the vast majority of workers.\n\n\u201cReally, we should be afraid of this court. The five guys who start determining what contraceptions are legal. Let\u2019s not even go there.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Pelosi\n\nThis is a very odd statement from the House Democratic leader, given that the majority opinion flatly states that \u201cunder our cases, women (and men) have a constitutional right to obtain contraceptives,\u201d citing the 1965 ruling in Griswold v. Connecticut, which under the right to privacy nullified a law prohibiting the use of contraceptives.\n\nDrew Hammill, Pelosi\u2019s spokesman, acknowledged that she \u201cmisspoke.\u201d \u201cObviously the impact of the court\u2019s decision is not to make these four contraceptive methods illegal \u2013 i.e. no longer allowed to be sold\u201d, he said. \u201cBut the overriding point here is that the decision does in fact limit access, which is the key point Pelosi made.\u201d\n\nHammill cited Justice Ruth Ginsburg\u2019s dissent that women have a compelling interest in being able to plan their pregnancies and that they need reliable birth control.\n\nLater, in the same news conference, Pelosi decried that \u201cfive men could get down to specifics of whether a woman should use a diaphragm and she should pay for it herself or her boss.\u201d\n\nHobby Lobby involved the owners\u2019 objection to four types of birth control but not diaphragms, but here Pelosi adhered closer to the essence of the case (and a related temporary injunction the court awarded to Wheaton College): the question of who should pay for contraceptives. (The court also vacated a decision by an appeals court that had ruled against a Michigan company that objected to providing any contraceptives under its employee health plan, so that would include diaphragms.)\n\nGinsburg\u2019s dissent pointed out that it costs $1,000 for the office visit and insertion procedure for intrauterine devices (IUDs) \u2014 \u201cnearly the equivalent to a month\u2019s full-time pay for workers earning the minimum wage.\u201d\n\nOur colleagues at PolitiFact gave Pelosi a rating of \u201cfalse\u201d for her comments, and we certainly agree, though we generally do not award Pinocchios when politicians fess up to a mistake.\n\nStill, we note that despite her office\u2019s admission of a mistake, the transcript of the news conference had not yet been corrected three days later. \u201cIt will be,\u201d Hammill said. \u201cWe\u2019re migrating to a new site in the next two weeks, so everything is a little slow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one thing we are going to do during this work period, sooner rather than later, is to ensure that women\u2019s lives are not determined by virtue of five white men. This Hobby Lobby decision is outrageous, and we are going to do something about it.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), remarks to reporters, on July 8\n\n\n\nThe Hobby Lobby decision was written by Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. That\u2019s certainly five men, but Thomas is African American.\n\n\u201cThat was a mistake, and he knew it right away,\u201d spokesman Adam Jentleson said. He noted that on other occasions Reid has simply said \u201cfive men.\u201d (The four dissenters included three women.)\n\n\u201cThis is deeply troubling because you have organized religions that oppose health care, period. So if you have an employer who is a member of an organized religion and they decide, you know, I wouldn\u2019t provide health care to my own family because I object religiously, I\u2019m not going to allow any kind of health-care treatment.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.), Democratic National Committee chair, appearing on MSNBC, June 30\n\nWhile there are some religions that object to certain medical procedures, Wasserman Schultz goes to quite an extreme to suggest that employers could block an employee from seeking any kind of health-care treatment. (Again, the issue was who would pay for contraceptives, not whether someone was barred from getting contraceptives.)\n\n\u201cThe Chair was referring to the Justice\u2019s ruling which puts employers\u2019 religious beliefs ahead of the medical needs of employees,\u201d spokesman Michael Czin said. \u201cWe fundamentally disagree with the logic behind that ruling.\u201d\n\n\u201c[In Griswold v. Connecticut,] the Supreme Court said that the right of privacy of individuals and families trumped any state right to ban contraceptives. It was a breakthrough. They found privacy, at least the inference of privacy, in the Constitution. I asked that question repeatedly of Justice Roberts and Justice Alito to make sure that they would honor that same tradition of privacy. The Hobby lobby decision violates that fundamental premise. [While both justices were careful in their answers before confirmation,] they both said they stood by the Griswold decision.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), quoted in ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Note,\u201d July 10\n\nDurbin serves on the Judiciary Committee and is the second-ranking Democrat on the Senate. Here, he appears to come close to saying what Pelosi asserted \u2014 that the ruling signaled a possible ban on contraceptives. He specifically mentions the Griswold decision, which as we noted was cited by Alito in the majority opinion as settled law.\n\nBut a Durbin spokeswoman said he was not trying to say the court was on a path to overturn Griswold. \u201cHe was saying Hobby Lobby was out of line with the general \u2018tradition of privacy\u2019 that permitted women to make their own choices about birth control,\u201d she said, asking not to be identified. \u201cHe was critiquing this ruling and its impact on women\u2019s access to contraceptive coverage, not making a prediction about future cases.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision opened the door to unprecedented corporate intrusion into our private lives. Coloradans understand that women should never have to ask their bosses for a permission slip to access common forms of birth control.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.), in a news release, July 9\n\nUdall\u2019s remarks were contained in a news release he issued with Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) about a bill that seeks to overturn the Hobby Lobby decision. There is a bit of an irony here: Udall voted for the Affordable Care Act, which built upon the employer-based health-care system in the United States and thus led to a ruling by the Supreme Court in the first place. So it\u2019s a chicken-or-egg question about how the door was opened in the first place.\n\nAgain, the issue is not whether women will have access to birth control, but whether the health plan will cover the cost. Spokesman Mike Saccone argues that this is, in effect, \u201ca permission slip.\u201d\n\n\u201cFollowing the court\u2019s decision, women will need to effectively ask their employers if they will continue to cover contraception,\u201d Saccone said. \u201cThey will need to determine if their boss will give permission for their insurance plans to cover birth control.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWithout insurance coverage, IUDs (what Hobby Lobby objects to covering) cost up to $1,000, which poses a huge barrier for women, especially if she is making the minimum wage. Without her boss\u2019s permission to get coverage for that service in her health plan, it becomes much more \u2014 potentially prohibitively \u2014 expensive for that woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore the Hobby Lobby decision, the fight against corporate influence was mainly about making sure real people and their ideas were in charge of elections. But now it is no longer just about a democracy; it is about keeping corporations out of our private lives, out of our bedrooms, and out of our religious decisions.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), statement in the Congressional Record, July 10\n\nHere again, a lawmaker mixes up the question of paying for contraceptives with a broader prohibition against all contraceptives.\n\n\u201cIf an employer doesn\u2019t cover contraceptive care, for many women access to birth control is effectively blocked because it becomes cost-prohibitive,\u201d argued spokesman Dan Malessa. \u201cIf an employer refuses to cover contraceptives based on its religious views, then its religious views trump the religious views of its employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, what I am objecting to is that these bosses should not be able to tell their employees that they cannot use birth control. Motherhood is not a hobby. That is what I am objecting to.\u201d\n\n\u2014Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wisc.), speaking on MSNBC, July 1\n\nMoore also falls into the trap of claiming that corporate bosses can now dictate whether women can have access to birth control. No boss under this ruling has the right to tell an employee that they cannot use birth control. That\u2019s simply wrong, but Moore\u2019s spokeswoman argued this is open to interpretation.\n\n\u201cCongresswoman Moore was referring to the Supreme Court decision that now allows certain employers to deny contraceptive coverage to their employees through employer-sponsored health care plans. By denying this coverage to their employees, many workers may not have the financial means to access this health care necessity,\u201d spokeswoman Staci Cox said. \u201cTo your point on the Hobby Lobby decision concerning only certain forms of contraceptive coverage, the congresswoman would argue that the ruling opens the door for employers to challenge other vital health-care coverage, not limited to the four contraceptives you mentioned.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019ve done, Chris, is taken away the religious freedom of their employees. They have to comply with the religious freedom of their employers.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.), interview on MSNBC, June 30\n\nIs Slaughter really saying that the court has taken away an employee\u2019s religious freedom because some contraceptives may not be covered by insurance? Eric Walker, her spokesman, says this is a matter of opinion.\n\n\u201cBy forcing an employee to live with the religious choices imposed on them by their employer, the employee\u2019s own religious freedom is infringed upon,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that \u2018freedom from religion\u2019 goes hand in hand with \u2018religious freedom.\u2019 The first amendment protects Americans from having religion thrust upon them by others \u2014 a standard the court failed to uphold, in the congresswoman\u2019s opinion.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nThe Fact Checker generally does not award Pinocchios for \u201cmisspeaking\u201d or for statements of opinion. And we obviously take no position on the Supreme Court opinion. But this collection of rhetoric suggests that Democrats need to be more careful in their language about the ruling. All too often, lawmakers leap to conclusions that are not warranted by the facts at hand. Simply put, the court ruling does not outlaw contraceptives, does not allow bosses to prevent women from seeking birth control and does not take away a person\u2019s religious freedom.\n\nCertainly, a case can be made that perhaps this is a slippery slope (as Ginsburg argues in dissent) or that the cost of some contraceptives may be prohibitively high for some women who need them. But the rhetoric needs to be firmly rooted in these objections \u2014 and in many cases the Democratic response has been untethered from those basis facts.\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "All too often, rhetoric gets ahead of the facts when Democrats discuss the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby ruling.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "All too often, rhetoric gets ahead of the facts when Democrats discuss the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby ruling.", "title": "Democrats on Hobby Lobby: \u2018Misspeaks,\u2019 \u2018opinion\u2019 and overheated rhetoric", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/07/14/democrats-on-hobby-lobby-misspeaks-opinion-and-overheated-rhetoric/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Production/Blogs/the-fix/Images/119988934.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GlennKesslerWP"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/07/14/democrats-on-hobby-lobby-misspeaks-opinion-and-overheated-rhetoric/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "hobby lobby, supreme court, contraceptives, democrats hobby lobby, alito, pelosi contraceptives, glenn kessler, fact checker, factchecker", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "hobby lobby, supreme court, contraceptives, democrats hobby lobby, alito, pelosi contraceptives, glenn kessler, fact checker, factchecker"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8486\"", "article_summary": "This Hobby Lobby decision is outrageous, and we are going to do something about it.\u201d\u2014 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), remarks to reporters, on July 8The Hobby Lobby decision was written by Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.\nThe Hobby lobby decision violates that fundamental premise.\n\u201cCongresswoman Moore was referring to the Supreme Court decision that now allows certain employers to deny contraceptive coverage to their employees through employer-sponsored health care plans.\nAgain, the issue is not whether women will have access to birth control, but whether the health plan will cover the cost.\nNo boss under this ruling has the right to tell an employee that they cannot use birth control."}
