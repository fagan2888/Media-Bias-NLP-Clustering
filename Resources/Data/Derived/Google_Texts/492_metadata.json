More than 80,000 people typically attend Seminoles football games. While Florida law allows people who legally own guns to keep them locked in their cars, schools are among the exception to the law.\n\nIn 2012, however, an appeals court sided with Florida Carry in a lawsuit seeking to overturn the University of North Florida's policy that banned guns locked in cars on campus.\n\nThe Legislature has considered but failed to pass bills the past two years that would allow students with concealed weapons permits to keep guns on campus. University President John Thrasher is a former senator who opposed the idea of allowing guns on campus while serving in the Legislature.\n\nFlorida State is also the site of a 2014 shooting in which a mentally ill gunman wounded three students at a university library before police fatally shot him. Some gun-rights advocates have used the event to argue for guns on campus, while opponents have cited the case as a reason to ban them.\n\nUniversity spokeswoman Browning Brooks said the school doesn't comment on pending lawsuits.\n\nFlorida Carry also has sued the University of Florida over similar policies.\n\n--\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the Florida Carry group is seeking to allow all legal gun owners to have guns in cars, not just those with concealed-weapons permits.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "A Florida State University student who wants to bring her gun to this weekend's football game sued the school Tuesday over a policy that bans legal gun", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/group-sues-fsu-over-policy-banning-guns-cars-games", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201212/hand_gun.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A Florida State University student who wants to bring her gun to this weekend's football game sued the school Tuesday over a policy that bans legal gun", "title": "Group Sues FSU Over Policy Banning Guns In Cars At Games"}, "story_id": 438831010, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Associated Press", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Group Sues FSU Over Policy Banning Guns In Cars At Games"}, "nid": 11889, "datePublished": "2015-09-09", "keywords": "guns on campus, Florida State University, FSU, Florida Carry, football games", "wordCount": 393, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "\"This newest prohibition they put on their game day plan was such a blatant violation of state law,\" said Florida Carry executive director Sean Caranna.\nWhile Florida law allows people who legally own guns to keep them locked in their cars, schools are among the exception to the law.\nFlorida Carry also has sued the University of Florida over similar policies.\n--This story has been corrected to show that the Florida Carry group is seeking to allow all legal gun owners to have guns in cars, not just those with concealed-weapons permits.\nThe suit was filed by gun-rights group Florida Carry on behalf of Rebekah Hargrove, who also wants to drive to campus for classes without violating the school's policy banning firearms in parking lots."}
