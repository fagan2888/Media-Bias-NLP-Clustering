According to Fierce Health IT, the game \u201caims to teach doctors and nurses how to work more collaboratively and avoid conflicts in order to prevent dangerous or sometimes fatal miscommunications.\u201d\n\nThe game uses simulations to teach its users how to avert tense situations in the real world. This increases positive interactions between co-workers and improves communication that could be critical when treating a patient.\n\n\u201cOur hope is that this project will enhance patient safety and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes,\u201d said Beth Mancini, a UT Arlington nursing professor and Associate Dean of the College of Nursing. \u201cBeing honored by the judges at this year\u2019s International Meeting on Simulation in Healthcare tells us that the virtual learning environment we\u2019ve built is among the very best in terms of content and design.\u201d\n\nGamification has worked for patients, creating motivation to use apps that can help monitor their health. The hospital employees who participated in the study were satisfied as well. Louann Cole, the health services researcher at Baylor who served as the study\u2019s project manager said, \u201cI cannot stress the importance of our Baylor physicians and nurses and the important role they had in this game. They were so candid. It was a wonderful experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe overall track record we have with our game-based simulations and the international recognition we are receiving is very gratifying, particularly when the subject matter is as challenging as it is in GLIMPSE,\u201d Zielke said. \u201cAs always, we owe our continuing success to the project team and the great faculty, staff, and students involved in these important research projects. The encouragement and support we get from our administration is also critical.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "<p>A video game simulation could be the solution to tense workplace relationships; increasing communication between employees and reducing medical errors.<em> By Katie Wike, contributing writer</em></p>", "title": "Gaming Helps Hospital Staff Work Together", "image": {"src": "http://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/0917f867/0917f867-ee92-4db2-aa59-7521fda82980/playing_video_game_2_people.jpg"}, "creator": "Katie Wike", "site": "HITOutcomes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "A video game simulation could be the solution to tense workplace relationships; increasing communication between employees and reducing medical...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "Title": "Gaming Helps Hospital Staff Work Together"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4066\"", "article_summary": "Gaming Helps Hospital Staff Work TogetherBy Katie Wike, contributing writerA video game simulation could be the solution to tense workplace relationships; increasing communication between employees and reducing medical errorsUniversity of Texas at Arlington College of Nursing, Baylor Scott & White Health, and UT Dallas have developed a gaming solution they claim will help workplace relations and improve patient care.\n\u201cAs always, we owe our continuing success to the project team and the great faculty, staff, and students involved in these important research projects.\nThis increases positive interactions between co-workers and improves communication that could be critical when treating a patient.\nThe hospital employees who participated in the study were satisfied as well.\n\u201cOur hope is that this project will enhance patient safety and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes,\u201d said Beth Mancini, a UT Arlington nursing professor and Associate Dean of the College of Nursing."}
