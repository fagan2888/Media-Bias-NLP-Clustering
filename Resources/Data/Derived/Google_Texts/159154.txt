In "stump speech after stump speech," Josh Levin writes in Slate, Ronald Reagan "regaled his supporters with the story of an Illinois woman whose feats of deception were too amazing to be believed."





Four decades later, Reagan's soliloquies on welfare fraud are often remembered as shameless demagoguery. Many accounts report that Reagan coined the term "welfare queen," and that this woman in Chicago was a fictional character. In 2007, the New York Times' Paul Krugman wrote that "the bogus story of the Cadillac-driving welfare queen [was] a gross exaggeration of a minor case of welfare fraud."

But the woman did exist, Levin writes, and while she certainly wasn't a typical welfare chislerâ€Ž, let alone a typical welfare client, Reagan's descriptions of her scams were mostly accurate accounts of her activities. Yet there was much more to her criminal career than the case that made her infamous in the '70s: kidnappings, con games, maybe murder. Levin's story about her life reads like an epic Gothic saga in which half a dozen villains turn out to be the same shape-shifting monster; every time you think it couldn't possibly get weirder, it does.
