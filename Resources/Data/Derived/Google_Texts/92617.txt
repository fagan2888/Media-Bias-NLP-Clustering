Hillary Rodham Clinton has come under fire repeatedly since an interview earlier this month with ABC’s Diane Sawyer, where the former first lady declared that she and husband, former President Bill Clinton, left the White House “dead broke.”

Mrs. Clinton’s recent interview with the The Guardian was no different. The possible 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was asked if her large bank account hurt her credibility with the American people. She and Mr. Clinton have reportedly banked more than $100 million since vacating the White House in 2001. Are the millionaire Clintons part of American’s income equality problem, The Guardian asked?

“But they don’t see me as part of the problem,” Mrs. Clinton said, “because we pay ordinary income tax, unlike a lot of people who are truly well off, not to name names; and we’ve done it through dint of hard work,” she said, according to the Guardian.

Analysts claim that Mrs. Clinton is eyeing a 2016 presidential run, but she remained mum on her candidacy during her interview with The Guardian, claiming she was still undecided on the matter.
