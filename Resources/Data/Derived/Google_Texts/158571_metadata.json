Of course, Republicans have done nothing to change their message, and have instead spent the past year-and-a-half either calling hardworking Americans inherently lazy for not earning more than poverty wages, or labeled them as moochers for expecting a return on their tax dollars and contributions to Medicare and Social Security pensions conservatives call \u201centitlements.\u201d There has been a substantial movement among well-established mainstream Republicans to campaign on \u201ceducating\u201d Americans about the \u201cvalue and culture of hard work and responsibility,\u201d and one Republican is promoting a Koch brother agenda that will teach Americans to be self-sufficient in a nation without a government for the people.\n\nIowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst said that \u201cWhat we have to do a better job of is educating the American people that they can be self-sufficient. They don\u2019t have to rely on the government to be the do-all, end-all for everything they need and desire, and that\u2019s what we have fostered, is really a generation of people that rely on the government to provide absolutely everything for them. It\u2019s going to take a lot of education to get people out of that. It\u2019s going to be very painful and we know that. So do we have the intestinal fortitude to do that.\u201d\n\nWhat Ernst claims she has the intestinal fortitude to do is repeal Obamacare, privatize Social Security, abolish education spending, eliminate food stamps, and force people to seek out church assistance once they have been liberated and educated in the Koch tradition of government-less self-sufficiency. She said, \u201cWe have to take a good, hard look at entitlement programs (Social Security, Medicaid, food stamps, unemployment insurance, Obamacare, and Medicare) and figure out how to get people off of those. It\u2019s exponentially harder to remove people once they\u2019ve already been on those programs.\u201d\n\nErnst\u2019s treatise on government dependency revealed that not only is she a hard line devotee of tea party orthodoxy, she has a perverse vision of America\u2019s 20th Century as a monumental error; because like the Koch\u2019s she sees government for the people as an abomination that needs to be abolished once and for all. Ernst laid out her Koch-libertarian agenda, including the wholesale elimination of each and every one of the New Deal\u2019s protections, under the guise of \u201ceducating the American people that they can be self-sufficient.\u201d In Ernst\u2019s mind, educating the people is \u201cgutting and annihilating all government services\u201d that she openly admits will be \u201cvery painful\u201d for the American people. However, according to her ideological bent, Americans will soon get over losing unemployment insurance, healthcare, disability insurance, Social Security, Medicare, and workplace protections because they will have been liberated from the government and learned a \u201cvery painful lesson in self-sufficiency.\u201d It is the Koch vision for America that Ernst promises to see through to fruition as recompense for their valuable campaign contributions to her Senate candidacy.\n\nErnst\u2019s intent to enact an incredibly cruel policy vision is to correct what she believes are a rash of America\u2019s past mistakes; like provisions in the New Deal that her Koch donors believe set America on a path of total devastation regardless the benefit to all Americans. Ernst also parrots a typical libertarian mindset that government is evil and claims that Americans have come to \u201crely on government for absolutely everything\u201d instead of \u201crelying on what churches and private organizations are doing because, as she errantly claims, \u201cgovernment gives them everything.\u201d Ernst means everything like Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance, access to affordable healthcare, workplace protections and the like, that her historical revisionism informs was not only a complete and utter waste, but something that the people never needed in the first place. It is not clear where Ernst gets her version of early 20th century Utopia that was the Great Depression, but she is certain Americans in food lines and working 80-hour weeks for dirt-pay were not only self-sufficient, but happily liberated from government protections.\n\nErnst is certain that programs aiding Americans were not there for those who really needed it and were completely ill-suited to help Americans who needed it most whether it was during the recent Republican Great Recession and 80 years ago during the Great Depression. Ernst pretends the gross amount of suffering among Americans could only have been helped by self-reliance and more churches but not government intervention. Most Americans look back at the New Deal\u2019s provisions, after both the 1930s and the most recent Republican recession, and regard them as preserving Americans well-being and elevating their way of life. They also view them as vindication of valuable government programs solely because they assisted the great majority of the people; including the older white people Ernst is likely appealing to most. However, for Ernst and her ilk, every and anything government has done to help the people since the New Deal has been degrading to Americans and teaches them dependence that Republicans are poised to bring to an end, along with the federal government.\n\nFor most Americans, the open hostility toward the American people by Koch-fueled Republicans like Ernst is founded on an innate heartlessness toward humanity and not regard for all Americans as \u201ccitizens.\u201d As an aside, Ernst does not display the same level of heartlessness toward a zygote she strongly believes the government has a biblical duty to protect and care for by bestowing personhood and constitutional protections by government fiat. It is likely that the majority of Americans do not share either the Koch brothers, teabagger Republicans, or Joni Ernst\u2019s hatred of government programs or the American people. However, for Republicans panting to elect candidates like Ernst to impose a Koch education amounting to \u201cannihilating\u201d all government programs has nothing to do with reducing the size of government and everything to do with enacting policies that \u201cwill be very painful\u201d for the people.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ernst's treatise on government dependency revealed that not only is she a hard line devotee of tea party orthodoxy, she has a perverse vision of America's 20th Century as a monumental error; because like the Koch's she sees government for the people as an abomination that needs to be abolished once and for all.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Rmuse", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Ernst's treatise on government dependency revealed that not only is she a hard line devotee of tea party orthodoxy, she has a perverse vision of America's 20th Century as a monumental error; because like the Koch's she sees government for the people as an abomination that needs to be", "title": "Joni Ernst Promises Americans a Very Painful Lesson If Elected", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/10/20/joni-ernst-promises-americans-painful-lesson-elected.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/image.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-20T21:30:53+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Commentary,Featured News,government services,Iowa Senate,Joni Ernst,Koch Brothers,Medicaid,midterm elections,New Deal,social security,Willard Romney,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2014-10-20T21:30:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-20T21:30:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "government services, Iowa Senate, Joni Ernst, Koch Brothers, Medicaid, midterm elections, New Deal, social security, Willard Romney"}, "article_summary": "She said, \u201cWe have to take a good, hard look at entitlement programs (Social Security, Medicaid, food stamps, unemployment insurance, Obamacare, and Medicare) and figure out how to get people off of those.\nIowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst said that \u201cWhat we have to do a better job of is educating the American people that they can be self-sufficient.\nIt is likely that the majority of Americans do not share either the Koch brothers, teabagger Republicans, or Joni Ernst\u2019s hatred of government programs or the American people.\nErnst pretends the gross amount of suffering among Americans could only have been helped by self-reliance and more churches but not government intervention.\nMost Americans look back at the New Deal\u2019s provisions, after both the 1930s and the most recent Republican recession, and regard them as preserving Americans well-being and elevating their way of life."}
