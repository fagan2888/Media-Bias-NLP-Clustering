Promises: Vulnerable Democrats think they’ve found a winning strategy for the November elections: Tell voters they can fix ObamaCare, but Republicans won’t let them. It’s a con. ObamaCare is unfixable.

‘Joe Garcia is working to fix ObamaCare,” says an ad for the Florida House Democrat. “He voted to let you keep your existing health plan and took the White House to task for the disastrous health care website.”

Of course, Garcia fails to mention ObamaCare is the reason millions lost their health plans to begin with. Or that its problems extend well beyond a glitchy website.

But this is the Democrats’ midterm election strategy, as revealed in a memo Politico got its hands on this week: Admit that ObamaCare has flaws, promise to repair them and argue that Republicans will only make things worse. Party leaders point to polls showing more people favor repair than repeal.

Still, why should anyone believe them?

Democrats already promised voters that ObamaCare would fix what was wrong with the nation’s health care system, only to be caught in a web of lies. Now they’re asking voters to trust them again to fix the very problems ObamaCare itself created.

Plus, ObamaCare’s flaws aren’t theoretical any more. Millions have been hurt. They’ve had plans canceled, gotten stuck with huge deductibles, lost access to their doctors or were priced out of the market altogether.

Case in point is a recent news story noting how many ObamaCare enrollees in San Francisco “are struggling to find even one doctor willing to take new patients.”

Another tells the story of a mechanic who can’t find a physician to treat his debilitating back pain after ObamaCare forced him to drop his old plan and buy one through an exchange.

As every marketer knows, dissatisfied customers will tell twice as many people about their experience as will satisfied ones.

But the deeper problem with the Democrats’ campaign promise is it’s built on yet another lie: They can’t fix ObamaCare. Nobody can. Its flaws are fundamental, not incidental. Any “fixes” just create new problems.

ObamaCare’s sky-high premiums, for example, are an inevitable result of the regulations at the core of the law.

The ill effects of the employer mandate can’t be avoided, unless the mandate itself is killed. But the mandate is there to keep companies from dumping workers into the exchanges and bloating ObamaCare’s already massive price tag.

ObamaCare must get the young and healthy to enroll, but actively discourages them from doing so. Why buy an overpriced ObamaCare plan now, when you can wait and buy a subsidized plan, guaranteed, after you get sick?

On and on it goes.

There’s a way to achieve ObamaCare’s original goals of making insurance more affordable, protecting those with pre-existing conditions, improving efficiency and cutting the number of uninsured.

But it starts with killing ObamaCare and replacing it with market-based reforms already proven to work.
