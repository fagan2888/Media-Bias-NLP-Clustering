But politicians in both parties are finally putting forth proposals to help\u2014and strengthen society.\n\nSimilarly, familial bonds help defray the costs of caring for the elderly. Filial responsibility\u2014foundationally a moral responsibility, but also a legal responsibility in the United States and in nations around the world\u2014has been central to social cohesion and distribution of social costs and responsibility. However, as family breakdown becomes more common, Medicaid (i.e., taxpayers) will have to bear more of the burden for care of adults. How much of a burden? In 2009, 61.6 million Americans gave uncompensated care to an adult \u201cwith limitations in daily activities\u201d at some point during the year\u2014an economic value of $450 billion in unpaid services. From cradle to grave, the social and personal benefits of a healthy family, and the costs of its absence, are evident. * * * These benefits of family are certainly evident to the president. Obama\u2019s experiences as a father and a husband are essential to understanding Obama the politician. His first book, Dreams from My Father, is driven by his search for identity not just through the prism of race, but as a man who hardly knew his father. He has addressed some of the most important moments and causes of his political life through his perspective as a father and husband: his speech on race in April 2008 and his remarks about Trayvon Martin, his case for the Affordable Care Act, and his advocacy for women. He has made promoting fatherhood a signature issue of his presidency. As someone who personally knows the \u201chole in the heart\u201d that a child has when a father is absent, Obama has withstood criticism from some on the left for focusing on the role of fathers in children\u2019s lives. In private prayers I\u2019ve shared with the president, and public moments where he leads through his perspective as a son, husband, and father, Obama\u2019s value of family has always been clear and moving to me. The case for Obamacare was not just about the benefits an individual would receive directly, but the indirect benefits received through family members. It\u2019s not just college students who appreciate being able to stay on their parents\u2019 plan until they were 26 but also the parents who no longer have to worry about their child going without care. Men benefit when their wives and daughters can no longer be denied health-care coverage because they are pregnant. Children don\u2019t want to see the money their parents saved up to help them with college costs evaporate, because their sick parent or sibling hit the cap on their health-insurance plan.\n\nAs he closed his speech to a Joint Session of Congress on the Affordable Care Act in September 2009, Obama spoke about why the late Senator Ted Kennedy was so passionate about health reform: Ted Kennedy's passion was born not of some rigid ideology, but of his own experience. It was the experience of having two children stricken with cancer. He never forgot the sheer terror and helplessness that any parent feels when a child is badly sick. And he was able to imagine what it must be like for those without insurance, what it would be like to have to say to a wife or a child or an aging parent, there is something that could make you better, but I just can't afford it. Obama described this as Kennedy\u2019s \u201clarge-heartedness.\u201d In our personal lives and in our politics, familial relationships provide a pathway to greater empathy. People naturally disbelieve or do not wish to consider a future misfortune of their own, and when they do they would like to think they could manage it. However, everyone can imagine their parent, sibling, or child hitting hard times and how desperately they would search for help. The U.S. needs its own \"family test\" policy. The White House continues to appreciate the value of approaching economic and social issues through the lens of family. The president hosted a Summit on Working Families in late June that packaged a mixture of tax reforms, women\u2019s rights, and workplace policies under the banner of supporting working families. Obama told attendees that these issues are \u201cpersonal\u201d to him: As the husband of a \u201cbrilliant woman who struggled\u201d with work-life balance issues, as the son of a \u201csingle mother\u201d who \u201chad to take some food stamps\u201d to feed her family, and as a father of \u201ctwo unbelievable young ladies ... I want them to be able to have families.\u201d The summit promoted a slate of policies that progressives put forward as supporting working families, including equal pay, raising the minimum wage, paid leave, child and elder care, and fighting workplace discrimination. Some of these are less about family than they are about supporting individuals who may happen to have families of their own. None of them explicitly value stable, two-parent families over other family types, and Democrats continue to show no interest in meeting Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam\u2019s call to \u201cstigmatize illegitimacy indirectly\u201d through tax benefits available only to married parents. As the costs of family breakdown become even more apparent, Democrats\u2019 no-judgment approach may seem insufficient in the face of a demographic and sociological tidal wave.\n\nStill, Democrats are no longer just playing defense on \u201cfamily values.\u201d The summit, and much of the president\u2019s political record, reflects Obama\u2019s convictions about where American families are hurting the most, and the policies that will serve America\u2019s families best. Hillary Clinton recently called for \"family-centered economics.\" In fact, it is the Democrats that have dominated the policy conversation around families since 2008 as the GOP has retreated to a radical individualism in rejection of the Democrats\u2019 more communitarian politics. * * * That is beginning to change. An emerging group of reform-conservative leaders is pushing a more family-focused economic agenda is emerging from top conservative leaders and thinkers. As Ross Douthat explained: \u201cThe immediate reformist priority, the raison d\u2019etre of the movement, is serving the interests and winning the votes of those \u2018middle class parents with kids\u2019 (and people who might want to be middle class parents with kids) on economic issues.\u201d These conservatives understand that people neither live, nor want to live, in isolation from one another\u2014and certainly not members of their own family. \"Room to Grow,\" the \u201creformicon\u201d manifesto, features a chapter on pro-family policies by W. Bradford Wilcox, which includes reforms to the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, eliminating the \u201cmarriage penalty,\u201d and looking at job training and vocational education through the lens of the family. National Affairs has advanced family-friendly tax reform. Senator Marco Rubio tied the strength of the family to the strength of the American economy in remarks at Catholic University in late July. This pro-working family approach did have something of a standard-bearer on the Republican side in 2012: former Senator Rick Santorum. During the 2012 Republican primary, Santorum\u2014who wrote a book called It Takes a Family\u2014was often a voice to address our obligations to one another, and he has continued to focus on this message since dropping out of the race.\n\nHe even spoke about family to a group of college students at the Heritage Foundation last summer. Of course, this group is not representative of college students in general (they were select politically active, primarily religious conservatives), or even the average young Republican activist, but Santorum is testing a message about families to audiences that do not have families of their own yet. Speaking after a presenter whose entire message was about applying the leadership lessons and ideology of Ronald Reagan to today\u2019s problems (one audience member asked what Reagan would think about Common Core), Santorum argued bluntly that a Reagan-era message of cutting taxes and shrinking government is no longer adequate. When asked what Republicans should focus on in 2016, he answered energy policy, manufacturing, and the family. \u201cWe need to focus on marriage, not the definition of marriage, but reclaiming marriage as a public good,\u201d Santorum said. \u201cMarriage and family is central. Every family in America is a little business \u2026 in fact, the word economy comes from the Greek word \u2018oikos,\u2019 which means home. Every home is a little economy. And when those little economies struggle and suffer \u2026 then America fails.\u201d In a widely read article in May, E.J. Dionne previewed the two central progressive critiques of the reformicon vision should it take hold in the GOP: Who can disagree that the breakdown of family structures has been a tragedy for low-income Americans? And why would these reformers not entertain interventions in a marketplace that has failed to secure a modicum of equity? Setting aside the novel notion that the Founders had family life rather than property rights in mind when they edited Jefferson\u2019s language, the more interesting question is what sorts of families the reformicons have in mind; surely not those composed of same-sex couples with children produced by in vitro fertilization. Elizabeth Stoker Bruenig recently made a similar critique of \"Room to Grow,\" suggesting that reformicons have chosen the sanctity of the free market over a robust family-leave policy that would help women and families proposed by congressional Democrats in the FAMILY Act.\n\nThese are serious charges. Ultimately, Dionne and Bruenig suggest, conservatives will value their ideology over the security and prosperity of families. But these are debates that conservatives have proven they can win. Reformicons are hoping they can convince Americans that the Republican Party once again cares not just for family values but for families\u2019 realities. It would be a good thing for America if we had that debate. * * * The 2014 midterms are shaping up to reflect the most vapid of our partisan sniping over the last year and a half: Democrats will try to convince America Republicans are crazy, and Republicans will do their best to live up to that billing. Of course, this kind of politics does not serve America well, and it also does not help our politicians, who win elections with no policy mandate and enter Congress ill-equipped to work with the other side. The help families need includes both promoting family stability and cohesion, and providing economic supports. This is a shame, because for the first time in Obama\u2019s presidency, the opposition\u2014at least part of it\u2014is putting forward real ideas and policies. There is also a growing consensus that the help families need includes both promoting family stability and cohesion, and providing economic supports. \u201cToday, it is harder and harder to be good parents and good workers for many working families. That's a tradeoff that is neither good for our country or our families,\u201d Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, told me. \u201cThat's why policies like paid leave, sick days, and child care are so vital, because they support families as they create economic security for their families.\u201d But Tanden also noted that \u201cit\u2019s important to have two parents involved in the life of a child whenever possible. As progressives, we see both greater economic support and support for family stability as key ingredients for success. We just wish conservatives saw both issues as well.\u201d In fact, Santorum took a similar both/and approach when I asked him about these issues. \u201cStrong families produce a strong economy, and I absolutely think there is a role for the federal government to play when it comes to promoting marriage and family,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 2009, the Brookings Institute released a study that, among other things, said if you graduate from high school, get a job, get married and then have children (in that order), your chance of being in poverty is just 2 percent. Yet our country\u2014whether through tax policy or through the rhetoric of our current president\u2014does very little to support the institution of marriage.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe insecurity families are facing and the barriers to creating new families, acknowledged across the partisan divide, demand attention. The upcoming midterm should be about which party supports policies that best promote stable, secure and thriving families.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marriage is on the decline, birthrates are down, and divorce rates are high.
