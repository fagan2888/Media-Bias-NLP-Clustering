They did not steal medical data, Community Health Systems said\u2014but that data can be the real prize in such breaches.\n\nWith its high prices and lack of a centralized health system, the U.S. is a lucrative target because in the right marketplace, health records can be worth a lot of money, said John Halamka, chief information officer of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and chairman of the New England Healthcare Exchange Network.\n\nThat\u2019s because people without health insurance can potentially get treatment by using medical data of one of the hacking victims.\n\nHalamka, who also runs the \u201cLife as a healthcare CIO\u201d blog, said a medical record can be worth between US$50 and $250 to the right customer\u2014many times more than the amount typically paid for a credit card number, or the cents paid for a user name and password.\n\n\u201cIf I am one of the 50 million Americans who are uninsured ... and I need a million-dollar heart transplant, for $250 I can get a complete medical record including insurance company details,\u201d he said.\n\nAs long as personal details like age, weight and height are approximately correct\u2014and with a faked second form of ID\u2014a person could use the stolen data to convince a hospital they are insured and receive treatment, Halamka said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is reducing the numbers of uninsured but there remain many Americans who don\u2019t have sufficient insurance for various procedures.\n\nThe situation is different in a country like the U.K., where the National Health Service assigns a unique ID number that ties patients to centralized medical records.\n\nIn the U.S. with its patchwork of health networks and insurance systems, spotting an imposter is more difficult. And moving to a common patient ID system is difficult due to legislation signed into law by former President Bill Clinton that limits what private companies can do with medical records.\n\nTo guard against hackers, health care CIOs are investing in security like never before, said Halamka.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing like a million-dollar fine to be a wake-up call to enhance security,\u201d he said, referring to the maximum $1.5 million fine that can be levied on companies by the Department of Health and Human Services for lax information security.\n\nHe advocates an ID system that would be voluntary, like the \u201cGlobal Entry\u201d system used at U.S. airports to speed immigration checks. In a voluntary system, consumers would need to approve the sharing of their information, which Halamka hopes they would in the interest of preventing the misuse of their information.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://core5.staticworld.net/images/article/2013/11/pcworld-idgns-primaryimage-100154539-small.png", "date": "2014-08-18", "description": "Medical records data can be a valuable asset, especially in a country where many have no health insurance", "og": {"site_name": "PCWorld", "description": "Medical records data can be a valuable asset, especially in a country where many have no health insurance", "title": "Why would Chinese hackers want hospital patient data?", "url": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2466660/why-would-chinese-hackers-want-hospital-patient-data.html", "image": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/11/pcworld-idgns-primaryimage-100154539-gallery.png", "type": "article"}, "parsely-link": "http://www.pcworld.com/article/2466660/why-would-chinese-hackers-want-hospital-patient-data.html", "twitter": {"description": "Medical records data can be a valuable asset, especially in a country where many have no health insurance", "title": "Why would Chinese hackers want hospital patient data? | PCWorld", "url": "www.pcworld.com/article/2466660/why-would-chinese-hackers-want-hospital-patient-data.html", "image": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/11/pcworld-idgns-primaryimage-100154539-orig.png", "site": "@pcworld", "card": "summary", "account_id": 6070762}, "fb": {"app_id": 1542125639335283, "pages": 7352931005}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-08-18", "sailthru.image.full": "http://core0.staticworld.net/images/article/2013/11/pcworld-idgns-primaryimage-100154539-gallery.png", "parsely-title": "Why would Chinese hackers want hospital patient data?", "parsely-tags": "type: news,source: idg news service,imported", "parsely-author": "Martyn Williams", "sailthru.tags": "tech-events,security,martyn-williams,news,short", "parsely-type": "NewsArticle", "parsely-image-url": "http://images.techhive.com/images/article/2013/11/pcworld-idgns-primaryimage-100154539-gallery.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-08-19T00:15:08Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce017\"", "article_summary": "They did not steal medical data, Community Health Systems said\u2014but that data can be the real prize in such breaches.\nIn the case of Community Health Systems, hackers stole patient names, addresses, birth dates, telephone numbers and Social Security numbers.\nThat\u2019s because people without health insurance can potentially get treatment by using medical data of one of the hacking victims.\nThe theft of personal data on 4.5 million patients of Community Health Systems by hackers in China highlights the increasing degree to which hospitals are becoming lucrative targets for information theft.\nIn the U.S. with its patchwork of health networks and insurance systems, spotting an imposter is more difficult."}
