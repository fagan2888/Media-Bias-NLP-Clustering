Well, get ready for a shocker, because Donald Trump just said something untrue.\n\nI know, I know, try to contain your disbelief.\n\nHere\u2019s what Trump tweeted at 10:33 pm EST:\n\nNotice that illegal immigrants will be given ObamaCare and free college tuition but nothing has been mentioned about our VETERANS #DemDebate \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2015\n\nAnd now, allow me to run through the various mentions of veterans throughout the evening during the Democratic debate.\n\nFirst, at 8:50 p.m. ET, when Jim Webb introduced himself to the audience, he mentioned that he wrote and passed the post-9/11 GI bill for America\u2019s veterans.\n\nThen, at 9:23 p.m. ET, Bernie Sanders said, \u201cI\u2019m the former chairman, Anderson, of the Senate Veterans Committee. And in that capacity, I learned a very powerful lesson about the cost of war.\u201d\n\nAnd at 9:37 p.m. ET, Anderson Cooper brought up Webb\u2019s service in Vietnam and Sanders\u2019 status then as a conscientious objector. Webb didn\u2019t take the bait to attack Sanders, but he did bring up his own military family and said he would be a great Commander-in-Chief.\n\nCooper then turned to Sanders and asked him about the same issue. Sanders applauded Webb\u2019s service and touted the passage of the GI bill. He mentioned another piece of legislation \u201cunder my leadership\u201d to deal with veterans\u2019 health care issues.\n\nAnd finally, at 10:18 p.m. ET, Cooper brought up the Veterans Affairs scandal and asked why it took so many reports and investigations before Sanders and others acted. Sanders defended his record on taking care of veterans\u2019 issues.\n\nAll of those clips, by the way, are here in this video, via CNN:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\nNow, you can say you didn\u2019t like their answers on veterans\u2019 issues or that they haven\u2019t done enough for America\u2019s veterans, but saying that \u201cnothing has been mentioned about our VETERANS\u201d when they actually were mentioned multiple times, including by a veteran on the debate stage, is incredibly misleading, to be charitable about it.\n\nObviously Trump was watching the debate, because other things he tweeted out things in reaction to what the candidates were saying, but did he just selectively zone out at those various points where veterans were brought up? Or did he hear what they said and just pretend they didn\u2019t?\n\nEither way, if you\u2019re going to use veterans as a political cudgel to attack your opponents, maybe you should get your damn facts straight first.\n\n[image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump tonight tweeted that the Democrats didn't mention veterans at all.
