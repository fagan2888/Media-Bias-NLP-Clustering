What do I do?\n\nConsumers were able to start using their insurance under the Affordable Care Act beginning Wednesday. Washington consumers can sign up using Washington Healthplanfinder.\n\n\n\nWhile the Insurance Commissioner doesn\u2019t administer the Washington Healthplanfinder, our consumer advocates are hearing from a lot of people who have completed their application and paid their first month\u2019s insurance premium, but haven\u2019t yet received their new insurance card or plan information. People want to know what will happen if they need to use their insurance before they get their insurance card.\n\n\n\nMedical providers need your insurance ID number to bill them for your care; they don\u2019t need the actual card. If you paid but do not yet have an ID number, you should contact your insurance plan and ask for that information. Your plan can also tell you when your card will likely arrive. If you feel more comfortable having a card, you can ask your company to tell you how to print a temporary ID card.\n\n\n\nIf you are not sure how to contact your plan, our website has contact information for each of the insurance companies that sells plans through Washington Healthplanfinder.\n\n\n\nIf you pay out-of-pocket for medical care because you don\u2019t have ID number, you can submit a reimbursement request to your insurance company.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Consumers were able to start using their insurance under the Affordable Care Act beginning Wednesday.
