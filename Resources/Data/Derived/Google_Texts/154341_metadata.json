UPS shares closed at an all-time high, hitting $104.67 per share by the market's close on Thursday. UPS shares are up 42 percent so far this year, outperforming the Dow Jones Transports Index, which is up about 39 percent over the same period.\n\nUPS said on Wednesday that a confluence of factors from bad weather, a shorter shopping season and a surge in online shopping were to blame. It stressed that only a small percentage of total packages were delayed.\n\nAll outstanding packages will be delivered by Friday, UPS spokeswoman Natalie Black said on Wednesday.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "Content Default", "description": "UPS scrambled on Thursday to deliver packages that had failed to arrive in time for Christmas as the No. 1 U.S. ground delivery service sought...", "title": "UPS Christmas Glitch Could Boost U.S. Delivery Competition | \"There's no downside to the retailers at this point to have more competition on the delivery side.\" | National | Boise Weekly", "og": {"site_name": "Boise Weekly", "description": "UPS scrambled on Thursday to deliver packages that had failed to arrive in time for Christmas as the No. 1 U.S. ground delivery service sought...", "title": "UPS Christmas Glitch Could Boost U.S. Delivery Competition", "url": "http://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/ups-cristmas-glitch-could-boost-us-delivery-competition/Content?oid=3029959", "image": "http://www.boiseweekly.com/binary/0822/Cover1-1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "UPS scrambled on Thursday to deliver packages that had failed to arrive in time for Christmas as the No. 1 U.S. ground delivery service sought...", "card": "summary", "title": "UPS Christmas Glitch Could Boost U.S. Delivery Competition"}, "oid": 3029959, "fb": {"app_id": 147773095298810}, "keywords": "Boise Weekly, Boise, Idaho, Boise online newspaper, Boise Idaho newspaper, Boise news, Boise arts, Idaho arts, Boise music, Boise entertainment, Boise calendar, Boise events, Boise dining, Boise Idaho news, Idaho politics, Idaho entertainment", "google-site-verification": "Cj6vU11_Cy6mgp0wvU_VpDONKhVZTCcHXO2BSYJfYHw", "verify-v1": "wytIU1RJHwcGDuN851dweJU4//2C5LKX+qnG2FSiOLM=", "thumbnail": "http://www.boiseweekly.com/binary/0822/Cover1-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=1000", "news_keywords": "boise weekly, boise, idaho, boise online newspaper, boise idaho newspaper, boise news, boise arts, idaho arts, boise music, boise entertainment"}, "article_summary": "\"There's no downside to the retailers at this point to have more competition on the delivery side.\"\nUPS shares closed at an all-time high, hitting $104.67 per share by the market's close on Thursday.\nUPS shares are up 42 percent so far this year, outperforming the Dow Jones Transports Index, which is up about 39 percent over the same period.\nUPS said on Wednesday that a confluence of factors from bad weather, a shorter shopping season and a surge in online shopping were to blame.\nUPS scrambled on Thursday to deliver packages that had failed to arrive in time for Christmas as the No."}
