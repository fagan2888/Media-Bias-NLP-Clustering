More than 250 patient groups are asking the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission to recommend that Congress not support a proposal that would increase cost-sharing for brand medicines for some poorer beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D program.

The commission, which advises Congress on issues related to Medicare, will vote Thursday on whether to recommend to Congress that they support a proposal that would increase co-pays for brand-name prescription drugs or eliminate co-pays for generic drugs in an effort to encourage more beneficiaries that are eligible for low-income subsidies to take up more generic drugs.

“Generic utilization is already high among all Part D beneficiaries and has increased every year since the program began,” the groups wrote in a letter last month. “Further, increased cost sharing for vulnerable beneficiaries could reduce adherence, increase spending on other health care services, and worsen health outcomes.”

The groups also warned that higher co-pays for branded prescription drugs could mean that patients reduce their adherence to taking their prescriptions, and therefore increase spending in other areas of health care.

“We should be encouraging these patients to take the medications their doctors prescribe rather than creating barriers that could lead them to skip doses or switch medicines, which could disrupt their treatment plans,” they write.

Among the patient groups signing the letter are the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the American Psychiatric Association, the AIDS Institute and the Community Health Action Network.

When MedPAC meets Thursday, they will consider Improving Medicare Part D as part of the meeting, specifically the Medicare Advantage market-based approach, according to an issue brief.
