He didn\u2019t hide from the media because he dropped a couple of passes.\n\nThe Broncos\u2019 fourth-year receiver, who had 85 catches last season, admitted disappointment in his latest personal performance.\n\n\u201cGreatly,\u201d he said at his locker Monday. \u201cThe TD and the one across the middle \u2014 just ridiculous. Painful.\u201d\n\nBy TD, Decker was referring to a potential touchdown pass he dropped from Peyton Manning near the left corner of the end zone in the third quarter of the Broncos\u2019 49-27 victory Thursday night against Baltimore. Nothing hurt there, for on the next play Manning hit Wes Welker for a 2-yard touchdown pass.\n\nThere also was a skinny slant drop by Decker late in the third quarter that would have given the Broncos a first down.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s more about focus than anything, attention to detail,\u201d Decker said. \u201cAll of that will carry over to the game.\u201d\n\nChamp, Dreessen remain out. Another day of practice, another practice without cornerback Champ Bailey or tight end Joel Dreessen participating. Both missed the Broncos\u2019 opening game. Bailey is healing from a left foot sprain. Dreessen, who is returning from a knee arthroscope, went through agility drills on the side along with rookie running back C.J. Anderson, who is coming back from an medial collateral ligament sprain.\n\nAlso missing practice Monday with various ailments were middle linebacker Wesley Woodyard, returner Trindon Holliday and special-teamer Omar Bolden.\n\nMcGahee and Giants? There\u2019s a chance the Broncos will take on running back Willis McGahee when they meet the New York Giants on Sunday at MetLife Stadium. McGahee was the Broncos\u2019 leading rusher the past two years but was released in June. The Giants are holding a tryout Tuesday for veteran backs Brandon Jacobs, Joe McKnight and McGahee.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos WR Eric Decker disappointed in his performance in opening game", "title": "Broncos WR Eric Decker disappointed in his performance in opening game", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/09/broncos-wr-eric-decker-disappointed-in-his-performance-in-opening-game/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130814_031625_eric-decker-broncos-081413.jpg", "height": 412}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130814_031625_eric-decker-broncos-081413.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-10T00:23:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T10:35:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdedf7\"", "article_summary": "The Broncos\u2019 fourth-year receiver, who had 85 catches last season, admitted disappointment in his latest personal performance.\nThere also was a skinny slant drop by Decker late in the third quarter that would have given the Broncos a first down.\nMcGahee was the Broncos\u2019 leading rusher the past two years but was released in June.\nAnother day of practice, another practice without cornerback Champ Bailey or tight end Joel Dreessen participating.\nThere\u2019s a chance the Broncos will take on running back Willis McGahee when they meet the New York Giants on Sunday at MetLife Stadium."}
