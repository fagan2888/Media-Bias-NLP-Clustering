The Legislature could have used its own lawyers to file the lawsuit, but it opted to hire two firms , including Bancroft PLLC lawyers who have typically charged $575 to more than $1,350 an hour. Bancroft received a flat fee of $250,000 for the first phase of the suit and it will collect $150,000 more if the case is appealed.
