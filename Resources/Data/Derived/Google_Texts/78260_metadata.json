While nearly two-thirds of those surveyed thought they were at least \u201cdoing OK\u201d the report also says: \u201cForty-seven percent of respondents say they either could not cover an emergency expense costing $400, or would cover it by selling something or borrowing.\u201d\n\nThat sounds pretty grim. For households with incomes of $40,000 or less, two-thirds said they couldn\u2019t cover a $400 expense out-of-pocket.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that being unable to pay an unexpected expense of no more than $400 puts one in the \u201cjust getting by\u201d category (another choice offered in the survey). A set of tires, a broken home appliance, or a speeding ticket would be enough to tip lots of households into a scramble for funds.\n\nGenerally, it\u2019s suggested that having enough money in an emergency fund to cover at least three months of expenses is a prudent goal. Without savings, what does a person do next? Maybe borrow money. Then, with interest charges, they owe more than before.\n\nI would guess that one reason so many people reported that they were both \u201cdoing OK\u201d but also unable to handle a $400 expense without borrowing is that they were already carrying credit-card balances they were trying to pay off. In that situation, it would make sense to devote savings to paying off high-interest debt, rather than putting it in a savings account to earn nearly no interest. And unexpected expenses would go on the credit card, in that situation.\n\nLots of people are still struggling with the effects of the Great Recession, and wages have been stagnant for years. Saving money isn\u2019t easy for people with limited incomes, and keeping it in the bank is hard, because \u201cunexpected\u201d expenses happen with surprising regularity.\n\nI remember well how tough it was to save when I was a young magazine editor in the late 1980s earning embarrassingly low pay. I tried to build my savings up, and took a second job waiting tables, but something like a routine car repair would easily wipe out most of what I had saved.\n\nBut the alternative to saving is a sure path to a harder financial future. Those without savings, particularly if they have bad credit, will end up paying more for things because they will have to borrow, and the costs of borrowing will make it even harder to set money aside. And if they don\u2019t handle the resulting debt well, such as by paying late or not at all, their damaged credit will make it harder and more expensive to buy a car, or a house, or even to rent an apartment. (Yes, landlords check credit scores).\n\nPeople who live within their means \u2014 about 80 percent said they do, in the Fed survey \u2014 and manage to create some savings for emergencies will have less financial stress, less need to borrow. They can avoid paying credit-card interest, as the majority of those in the Fed report do, and would likely have better credit scores, which lead to lower payments on loans.\n\nThere are many strategies for savings, and people need to find the one that fits them best, whether that\u2019s physically putting a few dollars aside every day or using a software program or app that transfers money into savings.\n\nIf credit cards lead you into debt, don\u2019t use them. If you always pay card balances on time and in full, benefiting from cash-back benefits and sign-up bonuses, then credit cards can help you financially.\n\nBe realistic. Many \u201cunexpected\u201d expenses can be anticipated. Old cars and appliances break. Electric bills rise in the summer. Plan ahead and avoid a scramble.\n\nSpending less to save more is common sense, but the Fed survey makes clear that many people have already cut expenses to the bone. \u201cThirty-one percent of respondents report going without some form of medical care ... because they could not afford it.\u201d\n\nThe flip-side to spending less is earning more, and lots of people would like to work more, says the Fed survey.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Nearly half of households in U.S. couldn\u2019t handle an unexpected $400 expense, Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalFP LatestNews, \r\nDavid Slade, \r\nDavid Slade, David Slade,financial goals,personal finance,savings", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Along with maintaining a good credit score, saving money for unexpected expenses is one of the most important personal finance steps a person can take.", "title": "Nearly half of households in U.S. couldn\u2019t handle an unexpected $400 expense", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150607/150609735/nearly-half-of-households-in-us-couldn-x2019-t-handle-an-unexpected-400-expense", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150607/PC05/150609735/AR/0/AR-150609735.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150607/PC05/150609735/AR/0/AR-150609735.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Along with maintaining a good credit score, saving money for unexpected expenses is one of the most important personal finance steps a person can take.", "title": "Nearly half of households in U.S. couldn\u2019t handle an unexpected $400 expense", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150607/PC05/150609735/AR/0/AR-150609735.jpg?201506070905", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150609735}}, "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "keywords": "Nearly half of households in U.S. couldn\u2019t handle an unexpected $400 expense , Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalFP LatestNews, \r\nDavid Slade, \r\nDavid Slade, David Slade,financial goals,personal finance,savings", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-07T09:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-06-07T09:05:00Z", "author": "David Slade"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Along with maintaining a good credit score, saving money for unexpected expenses is one of the most important personal finance steps a person can take."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf9f4\"", "article_summary": "For households with incomes of $40,000 or less, two-thirds said they couldn\u2019t cover a $400 expense out-of-pocket.\nAlong with maintaining a good credit score, saving money for unexpected expenses is one of the most important personal finance steps a person can take.\nMany \u201cunexpected\u201d expenses can be anticipated.\nSaving money isn\u2019t easy for people with limited incomes, and keeping it in the bank is hard, because \u201cunexpected\u201d expenses happen with surprising regularity.\nAnd unexpected expenses would go on the credit card, in that situation."}
