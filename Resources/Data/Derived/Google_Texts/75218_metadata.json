He said he worries more about money buying credibility in national conversations about important issues.\n\nWealthy individuals, he said, are increasingly using their money to \u201cgain respect, to gain hearing of their views through prominent journalistic institutions or prominent think tanks. I think those things do raise questions.\u201d\n\nLost on nobody was the fact that Summers was speaking at a \u201cSummit on the Economy\u201d hosted by Atlantic Media and underwritten by Koch Industries, the business empire of the libertarian Koch brothers, who have very strong political views that they support with large donations and sponsorships.\n\nHe said that when media outlets team with outside sponsors, or think tanks accept gifts from corporate sponsors, it creates the impression \u2013 if not the actual proof \u2013 of bias. Atlantic Media\u2019s properties include the magazines The Atlantic and National Journal and the business website Quartz.\n\nRelated: Like Indelible Ink, Benghazi Is Not Going Away for Hillary\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he confessed. \u201cI believe in the First Amendment\u2026but I think that if universities, publications and think tanks reflected more fully on all of this it would be a good thing.\u201d\n\nSummers said that during his tumultuous tenure as president of Harvard, he had ruffled feathers by raising similar concerns.\n\n\u201cI resisted the university taking a number of gifts or accepting a number of sources of funding where I thought that, on balance, the university\u2019s reputation was being arrogated for the benefit of a particular financial interest,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Cruz and Ryan \u2013 Don\u2019t Trust Obama\u2026Except on Trade Talks\n\n\u201cIf I can presume to make a suggestion to our hosts and others,\u201d Summers said, referring to The Atlantic, \u201cI\u2019d like to see a bit more effort to allow institutions that represent the middle class but don\u2019t have the resources to be sponsors, to nonetheless be provided sponsorship opportunities or forums of various kinds so as to create greater balance in public dialogue.\u201d\n\nModerator David Leonhardt of The New York Times jokingly asked if Summers was proposing \u201csponsorship scholarships.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be one way of thinking about it,\u201d Summers said drily.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said he is less concerned about big money in politics than he is about a more insidious threat to public discourse \u2013 something he calls the \u201cshadow civil society.\u201d", "title": "Larry Summers: How Fat Cats Use Journalists and Think Tanks to Buy Credibility", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/23/Larry-Summers-How-Fat-Cats-Use-Journalists-and-Think-Tanks-Buy-Credibility", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11112011_Summers_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/23/Larry-Summers-How-Fat-Cats-Use-Journalists-and-Think-Tanks-Buy-Credibility", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/11112011_Summers_article.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said he is less concerned about big money in politics than he is about a more insidious threat to public discourse \u2013 something he calls the \u201cshadow civil society.\u201d", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf60e\"", "article_summary": "He said that when media outlets team with outside sponsors, or think tanks accept gifts from corporate sponsors, it creates the impression \u2013 if not the actual proof \u2013 of bias.\nWealthy individuals, he said, are increasingly using their money to \u201cgain respect, to gain hearing of their views through prominent journalistic institutions or prominent think tanks.\nAtlantic Media\u2019s properties include the magazines The Atlantic and National Journal and the business website Quartz.\nHe said he worries more about money buying credibility in national conversations about important issues.\nRelated: Like Indelible Ink, Benghazi Is Not Going Away for Hillary\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he confessed."}
