Initially launched as a pilot program at two sites, Orchid allowed Sentara to achieve significant improvement in HCAHPS performance (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems), according to the release.\n\nBased on the success of the pilot, Orchid will be rolled out at 10 out of 12 Sentara hospitals in the first half of 2015. Orchid will help solidify Sentara\u2019s position by making sure every patient concern is captured, resolved, and aggregated to support continuous improvement, a vast upgrade from the \u201cpen and paper\u201d rounding of the past. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen an opportunity to be more purposeful, available, and thorough in our rounding process,\u201d said Genemarie McGee, Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer for Sentara Healthcare, \u201cDrive-by rounding isn\u2019t enough,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have a tool that encourages meaningful conversations between nurses and patients while making it easier to identify areas for improvement.\u201d In developing Orchid, CipherHealth had a dual focus: the patient experience and the user\u2019s need to make rounding efficient and effective.\n\nIt includes:\n\n\u2022 EMR Compatibility to allow for patient data to be pulled directly from the EMR;\n\n\u2022 Streamlined Issues Management allows for problems to be routed directly from the interface to the appropriate department for service recovery and confirmation of completion;\n\n\u2022 Robust Analytics Platform allows administrators and staff to create tailored reports to drive process improvement with actionable data.\n\nOrchid is the second patient care solution from CipherHealth that Sentara has introduced. In 2013, Sentara introduced Voice, a post-discharge follow-up solution designed to reduce patient readmissions. The success of Voice led Sentara to partner with CipherHealth to introduce Orchid across its hospitals in 2015.\n\nFor more health news, go to www.dailypress.com/health", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Sentara announces new mobile technology to improve 'rounding' efficiency, patient satisfaction", "Description": "Sentara Healthcare announced in a news release Tuesday that it's partnering with CipherHealth to implement a new software technology aimed at modernizing the rounding process -- and improving scores on patient satisfaction surveys, which under the Affordable Care Act have economic consequences....", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Daily Press", "author": "Daily Press", "og": {"site_name": "dailypress.com", "description": "Sentara Healthcare announced in a news release Tuesday that it's partnering with CipherHealth to implement a new software technology aimed at modernizing the rounding process -- and improving scores on patient satisfaction surveys, which under the Affordable Care Act have economic consequences.", "title": "Sentara announces new mobile technology to improve 'rounding' efficiency, patient satisfaction", "url": "http://www.dailypress.com/health/health-notes-blog/dp-health-notes-sentara-announces-new-mobile-app-to-improve-rounding-efficiency-20150519-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-555b55f6/turbine/dp-health-notes-sentara-announces-new-mobile-app-to-improve-rounding-efficiency-20150519", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp04.15", "twitter": {"site": "@daily_press", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=397500600, app-argument=http://www.dailypress.com/deeplinkid/83577949", "fb": {"page_id": 140388628320, "app_id": 515474311837346}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-05-19", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen an opportunity to be more purposeful, available, and thorough in our rounding process,\u201d said Genemarie McGee, Vice President and Chief Nursing Officer for Sentara Healthcare, \u201cDrive-by rounding isn\u2019t enough,\u201d she adds.\nOrchid is the second patient care solution from CipherHealth that Sentara has introduced.\nSentara is deploying Orchid, CipherHealth\u2019s cutting-edge rounding technology as part of an initiative to streamline the way patients and family members provide feedback during their hospital stays.\nThe success of Voice led Sentara to partner with CipherHealth to introduce Orchid across its hospitals in 2015.\nSentara Healthcare announced in a news release Tuesday that it's partnering with CipherHealth to implement a new software technology aimed at modernizing the rounding process -- and improving scores on patient satisfaction surveys, which under the Affordable Care Act have economic consequences."}
