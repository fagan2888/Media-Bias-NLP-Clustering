Dana Bash bashed Garrett stating, \u201cThere\u2019s a fine line between asking a tough question and maybe crossing that line a little bit and being disrespectful, and I think that happened here.\u201d Her CNN colleagues Don Lemon and Gloria Borger also took aim at Garrett. Lemon said, \u201cWait a minute, that was a little out of school,\u201d while Borger chided Garrett for making Obama \u201cangry and upset.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s petulant attitude towards Garrett and CNN\u2019s eagerness to defend Obama is emblematic of how spoiled Obama has been by the media from the moment he hit the national stage at the 2004 DNC. No doubt Bash, Borger & Lemon prefer the approach taken recently by their colleague Jim Acosta who said to President Obama, \u201cI wanted to ask you about what some people are calling your best week ever.\u201d The \u201csome people\u201d Acosta was referring to was CNN anchor John King who said, \u201cThis may well be the best week of his second term,\u201d last month following the Supreme Court ruling in favor of Obamacare and congressional approval of TPA for the TPP. During this time, CNN offered headlines such as, \u201cBest week in Washington: Barack Obama\u2019s legacy,\u201d and my personal favorite, \u201cBarack Obama gets his groove back\u201d.\n\nI remember when David Axelrod said that Fox News was not a legitimate news organization. Well, CNN bears a greater resemblance to an adjunct of the Obama White House than they do an actual news organization. I also remember when former Time reporter Nina Burleigh said she would be happy to give Bill Clinton oral sex for keeping abortion legal. Well, quite frankly CNN and much of the mainstream media have been giving Obama the Burleigh treatment for the past 6\u00bd years. It\u2019s high time we had reporters like Major Garrett who stood up to Obama rather than dropped to their knees.\n\nSo Major Garrett made President Obama \u201cangry and upset.\u201dWell, too damn bad. The families of the American hostages have far most just cause to be angry and upset than Obama does. Now that he has his precious little nuclear agreement with Iran, Obama needs to man up and get our four American hostages freed.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1a1f\"", "article_summary": "So Major Garrett made President Obama \u201cangry and upset.\u201dWell, too damn bad.\nIt\u2019s high time we had reporters like Major Garrett who stood up to Obama rather than dropped to their knees.\nNow that he has his precious little nuclear agreement with Iran, Obama needs to man up and get our four American hostages freed.\nNot surprisingly, the mainstream media is more upset with Garrett than they are with the American hostages in Iran particularly over at CNN.\nWell, quite frankly CNN and much of the mainstream media have been giving Obama the Burleigh treatment for the past 6\u00bd years."}
