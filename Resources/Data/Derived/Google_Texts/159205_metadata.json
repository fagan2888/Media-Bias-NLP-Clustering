But the justice that the Right had high hopes would be another solid conservative vote on the Supreme Court has a chance to redeem himself in the Hobby Lobby case.\n\nSome conservatives saw Roberts\u2019 decision as upheld a horrendously bad law because he believes it\u2019s the role of the legislature to pass law, not the courts to say if a law is politically good or bad. But most conservatives were upset by the decision and some have gone as far as calling Roberts a traitor to conservative judicial principles.\n\nThe Chief Justice may have a second chance for a first impression with conservatives if he leads the charge in overturning the HHS mandate when the Supreme Court releases its decision in June.\n\nThe initial news from yesterday\u2019s hearing, from Americans United for Life General Counsel Ovide Lamontagne is that Roberts \u201cgets\u201d the Hobby Lobby mandate objections and sees them as central to the case \u2014 meaning he would potentially vote to overturn the HHS mandate or render it ineffective.\n\n\u201cIt took 90 minutes of discussion before the heart of the case was addressed.
