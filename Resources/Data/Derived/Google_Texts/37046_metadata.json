(AP) - Courtney Force raced to the 100th victory by a female driver in NHRA history Sunday in the NHRA Kansas Nationals at Heartland Park Topeka.\n\nIn her second attempt to earn the landmark victory in two weeks, the 25-year-old Force outran Cruz Pedregon in the final round for her first Funny Car victory of the season and fourth of her career. The No. 1 qualifier Saturday, she finished in 4.148 seconds at 306.46 mph in her Traxxas-sponsored Ford Mustang.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of emotion right now,\u201d said Force, the youngest daughter of 16-time season champion John Force. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long weekend. I\u2019m so proud of my guys and I am happy to win this for all of the girls who have won races in NHRA over the years. They know how to win. This win is for them.\u201d\n\nForce is one of 14 female winners in the NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series, a list that started with Shirley Muldowney in Top Fuel in 1976.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the one who really paved the way,\u201d Force said. \u201cIt all started with her.\u201d\n\nThe 65-year-old John Force, eliminated in the first round, hugged the winner after the race.\n\n\u201cI am just so proud of her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe battles like me. People say she looks like her mom and she races like me. I saw her jump in there against Cruz and then she got the win. I gave her a big hug at the finish line and I just said I loved her and was so proud. I know she was disappointed last week and I just told her to have fun and race hard today. She is a competitor just like her sisters, Ashley and Brittany, and her brother-in-law, Robert Hight. I hope she remembers this feeling because history doesn\u2019t happen every day.\u201d\n\nCourtney Force nearly accomplished the feat last weekend in Georgia, but lost a close final-round race to John Force Racing teammate Hight.\n\n\u201cI thought I missed my chance,\u201d Force said. \u201cTo go all the way through to the final and let it slip through my fingers it was very emotional. \u2026 I was pretty much crushed.\u201d\n\nForce is one of three women who have won races this season, joining fellow Funny Car racer Alexis DeJoria, a two-time winner this season, and Pro Stock points leader Erica Enders-Stevens, also a two-time winner. On Saturday, Force and sister Brittany, a Top Fuel driver, were both No. 1 qualifiers.\n\n\u201cAll of the women run so well, it could have many any one of us,\u201d Force said. \u201cBut we were finally able to do it. I am just so proud to do it for all the girls out there.\u201d\n\nShe beat Dale Creasy Jr., Jeff Arend and Tommy Johnson Jr. to reach the final.\n\n\u201cAll day I was just trying not to think about it,\u201d Force said.\n\nIn the final, Pedregon\u2019s Toyota Camry slowed near the finish in a 4.225 at 250.60.\n\n\u201cI grew up watching my dad battle with Cruz and there he was lined up in the lane next to me,\u201d Force said. \u201cMy nerves were really going. I screwed up trying to get the car staged. Luckily, I got it together.\u201d\n\nAshley Force Hood, Courtney\u2019s older sister, was the first female Funny Car winner in 2008.\n\n\u201cTo start with when Brittany and Courtney both went to No. 1 I know this was already a special weekend,\u201d Force Hood said. \u201cI thought it could be a really good race for both of them since their race cars were running so well. They were both going rounds today and I started to get excited because sometimes you just have the magic. I had a feeling that maybe this would be the day. It is pretty cool. I watched it on my computer with Autumn, Jacob and Noah. I actually made a video. The kids were jumping up and down we were all really excited.\u201d\n\nSpencer Massey won in Top Fuel, and Allen Johnson in Pro Stock.\n\nMassey raced to his second victory in a row and second at Topeka, beating defending series champion Shawn Langdon in the final with a 3.871 at 314.02.\n\nMassey topped Brittany Force in the semifinals.\n\nJohnson won for the third time this season and the third time at Topeka, outrunning teammate Jeg Coughlin in the final. Johnson powered his Dodge Dart to a 6.663 at 207.81.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Courtney Force raced to the 100th victory by a female driver in NHRA history Sunday in the NHRA Kansas Nationals at Heartland Park Topeka.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Courtney Force raced to the 100th victory by a female driver in NHRA history Sunday in the NHRA Kansas Nationals at Heartland Park Topeka.", "title": "Courtney Force races to 100th female NHRA win", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/25/courtney-force-races-to-100th-female-nhra-win/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/25/22ec2a656b682114550f6a706700dd31.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/25/22ec2a656b682114550f6a706700dd31.jpg", "description": "Courtney Force raced to the 100th victory by a female driver in NHRA history Sunday in the NHRA Kansas Nationals at Heartland Park Topeka.", "card": "summary", "title": "Courtney Force races to 100th female NHRA win"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Cruz Pedregon, Topeka, John Force, Courtney Force"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc252\"", "article_summary": "TOPEKA, Kan.
