The investors were not named.\n\nPRESS RELEASE\n\nNEW YORK, January 11, 2016\u2014Vericred, Inc. (www.vericred.com), a healthcare technology startup delivering transparency solutions to the health insurance industry, has closed a second seed round raising $3.1 million through the sale of Series SEED II Convertible Preferred Stock to accredited investors.\n\nProceeds will be used to expand the company\u2019s data services and offerings while scaling its sales efforts. The new round follows a Series SEED round of $1.125 million, which closed in November 2014. Seventy-two percent of the first seed round investors participated in the second round.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing significant traction for our provider-network data,\u201d said Michael W. Levin, co-founder and CEO. \u201cThe health insurance market is going through significant disruption driven by the Affordable Care Act, consumerism and technology. Health insurance shopping experiences are being fundamentally transformed by eBrokers, consumer facing broker sales and quoting platforms, private and public health insurance marketplaces, and integrated payroll and benefit service providers.\u201d\n\n\u201cVericred is enabling this transformation through its provider-network data empowering individuals and employers to make informed health insurance purchase decisions including whether or not their doctors participate in plans,\u201d said Mr. Levin.\n\nVericred\u2019s provider-network data footprint includes networks for all under 65 individual, on and off marketplace health insurance plans, as well as about 80 percent of small group networks. Vericred plans to complete the small group dataset, along with Medicare Advantage networks, in early 2016. Provider-network data is mapped at the plan level, allowing for easy integration into health insurance exchanges and platforms.\n\nThose interested in reviewing API documentation can visit www.docs.vericred.apiary.io.
