School administrators maintain that Northwestern did respond adequately to the student\u2019s initial complaints. But the professor remains employed at the university \u2014 and now, his colleagues are pressuring Northwestern to do a better job at enforcing policies related to sexual violence.\n\nThe student charges that one of the university\u2019s star professors, Peter Ludlow, gave her alcohol and groped her on a trip to an art show in downtown Chicago during her first year of college. She alleges that he ignored her request to be taken back to campus \u2014 saying he wanted to \u201cparty together\u201d \u2014 and instead took her back to his apartment, where she eventually blacked out. She woke up in Ludlow\u2019s bed.\n\nThe school\u2019s director of sexual harassment prevention launched an investigation into the incident, and Northwestern concluded that Ludlow had engaged in \u201cunwelcome and inappropriate sexual advances\u201d toward the student. But Ludlow didn\u2019t get fired. In her new lawsuit, the student alleges that she struggled with \u201cstress and trauma\u201d that eventually led her to attempt suicide, all while the professor appeared to have suffered no consequences for his actions.\n\nNorthwestern officials say that Ludlow was, in fact, disciplined. He faced sanctions imposed by a six-person faculty committee, including being denied a major raise and an endowed chair. He was also required to attend sensitivity training. But Ludow\u2019s attorney confirmed to Slate that his termination was never really on the table.\n\nThat\u2019s not good enough for other faculty and staff at Northwestern, who launched a petition pressuring the school\u2019s Board of Trustees to update its sexual violence policies and make its disciplinary actions more transparent.\n\n\u201cWe believe Northwestern has compiled a record of poor choices,\u201d the faculty write. \u201cWhen internal findings document misconduct, especially misconduct consistent with violation of state or federal laws, Northwestern should prioritize campus safety and stand firmly on the side of those who have the least power and privilege, understanding that this may risk lawsuits from aggrieved parties.\u201d\n\nThe text of the petition lists a series of steps that the administration could take to ensure its compliance with Title IX and the Clery Act, the federal laws that require universities to adequately respond to sexual assault cases. It acknowledges that Northwestern is hardly the only school struggling with these issues; indeed, college campuses across the country have been accused of failing to protect victims in an attempt to sweep rape under the rug.\n\nIn the comments, faculty members at Northwestern \u2014 as well as college students and professors at other institutions \u2014 explain why they felt obligated to take up this cause.\n\n\u201cI am a Northwestern faculty member in History and Asian American Studies. In my 15 years here, two of my female undergraduate students have been victimized by male faculty. We need to better protect our students,\u201d one supporter writes.\n\n\u201cI am a PhD student in Political Science and a teaching assistant. Universities should be places of safety and should always act in ways to protect students and enhance their lives. I am concerned that the University\u2019s response was aimed at protecting itself rather than its students,\u201d another explains.\n\n\u201cI am a faculty member concerned about the well-being of our community,\u201d another simply states.\n\nJust 12 percent of Americans think that colleges are doing a good job addressing sexual assault. This issue has increasingly captured national headlines as college activists continue to demand progress. Last month, President Obama announced a new White House Task Force to deliver concrete policy recommendations to move forward in this area. And lawmakers have begun to pressure the U.S. Department of Education to crack down on universities that consistently fail to adequately respond to rape cases on campus.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"I am a faculty member concerned about the well-being of our community,\" one professor writes in a new petition.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "\"I am a faculty member concerned about the well-being of our community,\" one professor writes in a new petition.", "title": "Northwestern Faculty Protest University For Failing To Punish A Professor For Sexual Harassment", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/02/25/3326311/northwestern-university-faculty-protest-harassment/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/northwestern.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I am a faculty member concerned about the well-being of our community,\" one professor writes in a new petition.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/northwestern-321x214.jpg", "title": "Northwestern Faculty Protest University For Failing To Punish A Professor For Sexual Harassment", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/northwestern.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/northwestern.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-25T09:36:27+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1622\"", "article_summary": "Health Northwestern Faculty Protest University For Failing To Punish A Professor For Sexual Harassment CREDIT: Wikimedia Commons Northwestern UniversityLast week, a Northwestern University junior filed a lawsuit against the prestigious Chicago-area school, alleging that the administration failed to act after she accused a professor of sexually harassing her two years ago.\n\u201cI am a Northwestern faculty member in History and Asian American Studies.\nBut the professor remains employed at the university \u2014 and now, his colleagues are pressuring Northwestern to do a better job at enforcing policies related to sexual violence.\nThe school\u2019s director of sexual harassment prevention launched an investigation into the incident, and Northwestern concluded that Ludlow had engaged in \u201cunwelcome and inappropriate sexual advances\u201d toward the student.\nIn the comments, faculty members at Northwestern \u2014 as well as college students and professors at other institutions \u2014 explain why they felt obligated to take up this cause."}
