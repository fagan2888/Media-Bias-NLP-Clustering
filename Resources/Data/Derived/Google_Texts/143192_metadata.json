His death was a terrible tragedy that no family should have to endure. This is a subject that is never far from my family\u2019s minds \u2013 or our hearts. And Eric Garner\u2019s death put a spotlight on police-community relations and civil rights \u2013 some of most critical issues our nation faces today. \u201cToday\u2019s outcome is one that many in our city did not want. Yet New York City owns a proud and powerful tradition of expressing ourselves through non-violent protest. We trust that those unhappy with today\u2019s grand jury decision will make their views known in the same peaceful, constructive way. We all agree that demonstrations and free speech are valuable contributions to debate, and that violence and disorder are not only wrong \u2013 but hurt the critically important goals we are trying to achieve together. \u201cThese goals \u2013 of bringing police and community closer together and changing the culture of law enforcement -- are why we have introduced so many reforms this year. It starts at the top with Commissioner Bratton - a strong, proven change agent. We have dramatically reduced the overuse and abuse of stop-and-frisk. We have initiated a comprehensive plan to retrain the entire NYPD to reduce the use of excessive force and to work with the community. We have changed our marijuana policy to reduce low-level arrests, and we have launched a new pilot program for body cameras for officers to improve transparency and accountability. \u201cThese are the long term reforms we are making to ensure we don\u2019t endure tragedies like this one again in the future. But we also know that this chapter is not yet complete. The grand jury is but one part of the process. There will still be an NYPD internal investigation. And we know the US Attorney is continuing her investigation. Should the federal government choose to act, we stand ready to cooperate. \u201cDr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2013 one of our nation\u2019s most profound thinkers on these issues \u2013 taught us something very simple: \u201cInjustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\u201d The problem of police-community relations and civil rights is not just an issue for people of color \u2013 or young people \u2013 or people who get stopped by police. This is a fundamental issue for every American who cares about justice. \u201cAll of us must work together to make this right \u2013 to work for justice \u2013 and to build the kind of city \u2013 and nation \u2013 we need to be.\u201d (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said on Thursday that the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, two unarmed black men who were kille...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-12-05 12:35:23 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "WASHINGTON -- House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said on Thursday that the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, two unarmed black men who were kille...", "title": "John Boehner Demands More Answers In Deaths Of Michael Brown, Eric Garner", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/04/john-boehner-eric-garner_n_6269922.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2353604/images/o-JOHN-BOEHNER-ERIC-GARNER-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said on Thursday that the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, two unarmed black men who were kille...", "creator": "SabrinaSiddiqui", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/2353604/images/o-JOHN-BOEHNER-ERIC-GARNER-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "John Boehner Demands More Answers In Deaths Of Michael Brown, Eric Garner", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-12-04 12:35:23 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=6269922", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "john boehner eric garner,john boehner michael brown,john boehner ferguson,Michael Brown grand jury,eric garner chokehold,Eric Garner death,eric garner grand jury,ferguson grand jury,darren wilson grand jury,ferguson grand jury decision,eric garner protests,eric garner indictment,michael brown protests,Politics News,video", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "john boehner eric garner,john boehner michael brown,john boehner ferguson,Michael Brown grand jury,eric garner chokehold,Eric Garner death,eric garner grand jury,ferguson grand jury,darren wilson grand jury,ferguson grand jury decision,eric garner protests,eric garner indictment,michael brown protests,Politics News,video", "published_time": "2014-12-04 12:35:23 -0500", "modified_time": "2014-12-04 12:59:02 -0500"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9797\"", "article_summary": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D)\u201cThis is a deeply emotional day \u2013 for the Garner Family, and all New Yorkers.\nAnd Eric Garner\u2019s death put a spotlight on police-community relations and civil rights \u2013 some of most critical issues our nation faces today.\nYet New York City owns a proud and powerful tradition of expressing ourselves through non-violent protest.\nWe trust that those unhappy with today\u2019s grand jury decision will make their views known in the same peaceful, constructive way.\n\u201cThese are the long term reforms we are making to ensure we don\u2019t endure tragedies like this one again in the future."}
