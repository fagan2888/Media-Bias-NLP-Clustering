Brown tried everything to ease her son\u2019s suffering, but said nothing worked except cannabis oil. Although the 38-year-old Minnesota mother seemingly had good intentions, she's now being charged with possession of a controlled illegal substance and child endangerment. She could now face up to two years in jail and a $6,000 fine.\n\nThe now 15-year-old Trey Brown was playing baseball when he was struck in the head by a line drive ball \u2014 a hard-flying, close-to-the-ground ball traveling on a straight path. After the incident, Angela said her son suffered regularly from head pain, seizures, and muscular spasms. \"He was in so much pain that he didn't want to live,\" Brown told the Huffington Post. \u201cNo parent can understand it until they have to sit in their child's bed and hold them down so they don't hurt themselves, or they have to sit beside them because they hurt so much that they can't handle your touch.\"\n\nDesperate to help Trey, Brown said she and her husband David tried several medicines, but unfortunately, nothing was effective. Brown said a doctor recommended the couple to try cannabis oil, so they went to Boulder, Colo., to purchase the medicinal drug. She began giving her son the oil, and to their amazement, the couple saw immediate results.\"Once it hit his system, Trey said the pressure in his brain was relieved,\" she said. \"You could literally see the muscle spasms stopping. He felt amazing.\u201d\n\nThe Browns were pleased with their son\u2019s progress and shared the great news, but not everyone was happy for them. Someone the family knew called the police to report Angela for administering medical marijuana in a state where the drug is still illegal. Lac qui Parle County investigators confiscated the medicinal oil and called Child Protective Services, who showed up to evaulate Trey. When he told them that he wasn\u2019t getting high but soley taking oil the to rid his pain, and that it was working, Child Protective Services closed the case, but the criminal charges still remain.\n\nCases like these are all too familiar. Like Angela, the parents of 6-year-old Charlotte Figi were desperate to see their her healthy. As a baby, she started having seizures, and they only worsened over time. When doctors told Charlotte\u2019s parents to expect the worse, the Figis were determined to find a solution, trying new diets and medicines. But like the Browns, they saw no improvement. Their daughter\u2019s health continued to decline, and the Figis started to consider alternative treatments, including cannabis oil. The drug worked, significantly reducing the severity of Charlotte\u2019s seizures and improving her speech.\n\nThe difference between Charlotte and Trey is geographical. In Colorado, medical and recreational marijuana is legal. Minnesota legislatures approved a medical marijuana bill, but it's not expected to go into effect until next July. The Browns don\u2019t want to want to wait a year, and they're hoping the case gets dropped so that they can focus on their son\u2019s health. Now that he\u2019s off the cannabis oil, Angela says Trey\u2019s condition has spiraled out of control. The couple plans to move to Colorado so they can treat their son without worrying about prosecution.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been off the oil since mid-April and the horrible migraine headaches and body pains are back,\" she told HuffPo. \u201cHe can\u2019t be a normal 15-year-old.\u201d The couple created a page on GoFundMe to raise money for a legal team. So far, they've raised $6,010.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cannabis oil, angela brown, illegal substance, minnesota, drug, brain injury", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "After giving her teenage son medical marijuana oil to help with seizures and other symptoms from a traumatic brain injury, Minnesota mom Angela Brown is facing jail time.", "title": "Mom Who Treated Her Son With Medical Marijuana Faces Jail Time [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/after-treating-sons-head-injury-cannabis-oil-minnesota-mom-faces-jail-time-299490", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/23/marijuana.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After giving her teenage son medical marijuana oil to help with seizures and other symptoms from a traumatic brain injury, Minnesota mom Angela Brown is facing jail time.", "title": "Mom Who Treated Her Son With Medical Marijuana Faces Jail Time [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/after-treating-sons-head-injury-cannabis-oil-minnesota-mom-faces-jail-time-299490", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/23/marijuana.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/08/23/marijuana.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-08-23T17:13:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-23T17:13:51-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "After giving her teenage son medical marijuana oil to help with seizures and other symptoms from a traumatic brain injury, Minnesota mom Angela Brown is facing jail time."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3646\"", "article_summary": "Now that he\u2019s off the cannabis oil, Angela says Trey\u2019s condition has spiraled out of control.\nTheir daughter\u2019s health continued to decline, and the Figis started to consider alternative treatments, including cannabis oil.\nEver since Angela Brown\u2019s son suffered a severe brain injury in 2011, he's been complaining of excruciating pain.\nBrown tried everything to ease her son\u2019s suffering, but said nothing worked except cannabis oil.\nDesperate to help Trey, Brown said she and her husband David tried several medicines, but unfortunately, nothing was effective."}
