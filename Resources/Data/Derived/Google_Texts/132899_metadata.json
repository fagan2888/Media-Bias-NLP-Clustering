While biosimilars have been marketed in Europe since 2006, Congress established the regulatory framework for biosimilar drugs in the US in 2010, with the passage of \u201cObamacare.\u201d Neupogen has been on the market for more than 20 years.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act outlined detailed regulations for interactions between the holder of the original license (the \u201cReference Product Sponsor\u201d (RPS)) and the biosimilar applicant, which involved the exchange of patent and other information on a timetable that was soon called the \u201cPatent Dance.\u201d While, early in the process, the biosimilar applicant is required to provide its application, including manufacturing information to the RPS, and the RPS is supposed to provide information on relevant patents, Sandoz successfully argued that the Patent Dance was optional and Amgen is appealing this point.\n\nExperts note that this is essentially an \u201cat risk launch,\u201d since Amgen. or third parties. may have patents that are infringed by Sandoz at some point in their manufacturing process.
