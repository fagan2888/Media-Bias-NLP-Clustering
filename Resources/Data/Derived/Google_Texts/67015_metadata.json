Released June 27, the movie may even reach the $300-million mark before its run is out. At numerous theaters in Beijing, tickets were priced at nearly $21.\n\nParamount went to great lengths to court the Chinese market, filming in Hong Kong and parts of the mainland and casting Chinese performers including Li Bingbing. The film\u2019s premiere was held in Hong Kong and the movie was presented as the final-night screening at the Shanghai International Film Festival.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t been entirely smooth sailing for \u201cT4\u201d in China. The movie included numerous product-placement arrangements with Chinese brands, and not all of them are happy with the way their deals turned out.\n\nOne hotel-mall complex, Pangu Plaza, has already filed a lawsuit against two middlemen that it claims failed to deliver on promises including getting Paramount to feature the building in the film\u2019s posters and other promotional materials. Pangu even sought to persuade government authorities to block or delay the film\u2019s release but were unsuccessful.\n\nNow another entity is making noise that it is unsatisfied with a product-placement agreement it had signed with M1905, the online arm of the state-run China Movie Channel. Representatives of the Wulong Karst National Park in Sichuan province held a news conference in Beijing on Monday to claim that they had paid to have a sign identifying the park included in the film, but that it was not.\n\nPark officials said they intended to take legal action, but there was no evidence as of Tuesday evening that any lawsuit had been filed. M1905 is one of the film\u2019s production and promotion partners.\n\nIn all, for the seven days ending Sunday, \u201cTransformers\u201d took in $115 million. In second place for the week was the local production \u201cThe Breakup Guru,\u201d which took in $41 million for a total of $66 million despite going head-to-head with \u201cTransformers.\u201d\n\nIn third place for the week was Disney's \u201cMaleficent,\u201d which took in $4.4 million for a total of $43 million on the mainland. The Chinese-South Korean production \u201cBunshinsaba 3\u201d was in fourth place with $3.7 million and the late-coming Oscar nominee \u201cAmerican Hustle\u201d \u2014 debuting more than half a year after it opened stateside \u2014 managed to hustle up just under $1.5 million.\n\nFollow @JulieMakLAT for news from China", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "'Transformers' set to oust 'Avatar' as top-grossing film ever in China", "Description": "\u201cTransformers: Age of Extinction\u201d looked set to oust \u201cAvatar\u201d on Tuesday to become the top-grossing movie ever in China as the Paramount Pictures film continued to dominate the mainland box office for a second week.
