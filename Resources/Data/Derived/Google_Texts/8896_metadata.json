According to Gallup, a record-high 56 percent of Americans now disapprove of the 2010 law.\n\nReasons to dislike Obamacare have abounded from the outset, and on Friday the administration unveiled a new one: In large swaths of the country, the price of insurance sold on the federal health exchange is going up. That will force many of those who bought coverage last year to scramble to find a new policy or fork over as much as 20 percent in higher premiums. How\u2019s that \u201caffordable\u201d health care working out for you?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRepublicans in Congress \u2014 less inclined than some deep thinkers to sneer at \u201cthe stupidity of the American people\u201d \u2014 unanimously opposed the Affordable Care Act when it was enacted, and were rewarded in the 2010 midterms for their steadfastness. In the ensuing four years, Republicans repeatedly called for replacing Obamacare with alternatives expanding choice, competition, and market reforms \u2014 and the voters just rewarded them again.\n\nOf course, even with their new majorities in Congress Republicans will have to contend with President Obama\u2019s veto pen. So a bill \u201crepealing every last vestige of Obamacare,\u201d as Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky exuberantly proposed on Election Night, isn\u2019t in the cards anytime soon. But that doesn\u2019t mean there is nothing to be done, particularly since the Supreme Court has agreed to hear a new challenge to the law, one that could potentially cause Obamacare to topple under its own weight.\n\nOne way or another, changes in the law are coming. Not all of them have to be bitterly controversial, or provoke cries of Republican overreaching. Here\u2019s a suggestion: Allow individuals to buy health insurance from out of state.\n\nIn an age when consumers can purchase almost anything from vendors almost anywhere, government policies protecting insurance companies from interstate competition are indefensible. Lawmakers would be laughed out of office, rightly, if they insisted that the only CDs, cellphones, or ceramics their constituents could buy were those manufactured in the state where they lived. All sorts of financial products are routinely acquired without state borders proving an impenetrable barrier: life insurance, service warranties, stocks and bonds, bank accounts, credit cards. Why should a medical plan be any different?\n\nThere is no good reason to deny freedom of choice to Americans when it comes to buying health insurance. Yet licensing rules in virtually every state effectively prevent individual residents from shopping for health plans in any other state. Consequently, there is no national market for health insurance. There are only autonomous state markets, many dominated by near-monopolies that can get away with offering lower quality insurance at ever-higher premiums.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Michael Cannon of the Cato Institute points out, it isn\u2019t only insurance companies that are sheltered from the rigors of competition. Insurance regulators are insulated too. State governments, inveigled by special interests, can burden health insurance policies with more and more mandatory benefits, driving up premiums to cover services that many consumers would never willingly choose.\n\nIn Massachusetts, for instance, health insurance policies must cover at least 49 specified treatments and types of providers, among them midwives, infertility treatments, hair prostheses, and chiropractors. But what if all you want is a plain-vanilla health plan akin to those sold by insurers in New Hampshire (only 38 state-required health-care mandates) or, better yet, in Michigan (24) or Idaho (13)? Tough luck. That\u2019s what it means when interstate commerce in health insurance is blocked.\n\nOpinion polls show broad public support for the idea \u2014 as high as 77 percent in a recent Rasmussen poll. Legislation to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, currently being drafted by Florida Senator Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan, will reportedly include interstate choice. \u201cWe want . . . every American to be able to buy the kind of health insurance they want at a price that they are willing to buy and from any company in America that will sell it to you,\u201d Rubio said in a recent radio interview.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say change can only come from above. One can envision a moderate, pro-reform governor championing such market choice at the state level \u2014 a just-elected Republican, say, with a deep knowledge of the health insurance industry. How about it, Charlie Baker? Why not use that new bully pulpit to advocate for legislation freeing Massachusetts residents to buy a health policy from any properly licensed insurance company in America willing to sell it to them?\n\nIt\u2019s a fix long overdue. With the distortions imposed first by Romneycare and then Obamacare, Massachusetts could use it more than ever. The rest of the country could too.", "article_metadata": {"eomportal-loid": "4.0.378015296", "eomportal-id": 84248, "description": "Even with their new majorities in Congress Republicans will have to contend with President Obama\u2019s veto pen.
