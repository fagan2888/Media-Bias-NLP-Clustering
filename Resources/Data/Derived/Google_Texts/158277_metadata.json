But sleepwalking may continue into adulthood. It can also start later in life, according to the researchers. Sleep terrors, in which a person screams and is intensely fearful, also begin in childhood.\n\nIn the new study, Dr. Jacques Montplaisir, of Hopital du Sacre-Coeur de Montreal, and colleagues examined connections between these conditions in parents and adults. They looked at almost 2,000 kids born in Quebec from 1997 to 1998.\n\nThe researchers found that 56 percent of the children (aged 1.5 to 13 years) had sleep terrors. Younger children were more likely to have sleep terrors, the study noted. Sleepwalking, meanwhile, affected 29 percent of kids aged 2.5 to 13 years. Sleepwalking was less common in the younger kids, according to the study.\n\nThe odds of sleepwalking grew, depending on whether one or both parents were sleepwalkers.\n\nOnly 23 percent of kids whose parents didn't sleepwalk developed the disorder. About 47 percent of those with one sleepwalking parent went on to be sleepwalkers. And if two parents wandered around at night while sleeping, the odds were about 62 percent that their child would also sleepwalk.\n\nThe study is published in the May 4 JAMA Pediatrics.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more about sleepwalking, try the National Sleep Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/kids-health-information-23/misc-kid-s-health-news-435/sleepwalking-parents-likely-to-have-sleepwalking-kids-698999.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/images/editorial/sleeping_kid.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "Nighttime wandering passed down to as many as 60 percent of children, study finds", "title": "Sleepwalking Parents Likely to Have Sleepwalking Kids"}, "description": "Nighttime wandering passed down to as many as 60 percent of children, study finds", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "En Espa\u00f1olMONDAY, May 4, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- More than 60 percent of children with two sleepwalking parents go on to develop the condition themselves, new research shows.\n\"These findings point to a strong genetic influence on sleepwalking and, to a lesser degree, sleep terrors,\" the Canadian study authors wrote.\nSleepwalking was less common in the younger kids, according to the study.\nYounger children were more likely to have sleep terrors, the study noted.\nSleep terrors, in which a person screams and is intensely fearful, also begin in childhood."}
