When their incomes fluctuate, however, that \u201chover\u201d can turn into a \u201cbounce.\u201d\n\nState officials say the transition between Covered California and Medi-Cal is supposed to be \u201cseamless,\u201d but in reality, moving from one to the other sometimes puts Californians\u2019 health coverage \u2014 and their health \u2014 at risk.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a seamless transition. There\u2019s not someone helping them figure out who to call or how to navigate the system,\u201d said Jen Flory, senior attorney at the Western Center on Law and Poverty. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s not working correctly.\u201d\n\nQ: I work for a temp agency and keep falling off Medi-Cal because my income changes. But I need to see a doctor for my cancer. What should I do?\n\nA: Jesse Weiss, 52, lives in Yreka, near the Oregon border, where specialized medical care can be hard to come by no matter what kind of insurance you have.\n\nWeiss suffers from several ailments, but the most serious is the skin cancer that has remained essentially untreated since it was diagnosed three years ago and \u201chas completely destroyed the top of my head,\u201d he said. He falls into and out of Medi-Cal, which is the state-federal insurance program for low-income residents. When his income is too high for Medi-Cal, he should be able to get coverage through Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange.\n\nBut Weiss finds the back-and-forth confusing and isn\u2019t sure he could afford a Covered California plan even with its promised subsidies.\n\nWhen he has Medi-Cal, his local doctor refers him to a specialist at UC Davis Medical Center, about four hours away. But it\u2019s a months-long wait, and he never gets in before he falls off Medi-Cal again.\n\n\u201cWhen I lose Medi-Cal, then I get bumped off this list and have to start all over again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like musical chairs. If you lose your spot, you\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\nWeiss is one of about 12 million Californians in Medi-Cal, while about 1.4 million have Covered California plans. With some exceptions, you qualify for Medi-Cal if you make up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) \u2014 or about $16,200 for an individual.\n\nBetween 138 and 400 percent of FPL, you qualify for subsidized health insurance from Covered California. With 138 percent as the dividing line, movement between the programs is common.\n\nThe UC Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education estimates 16.5 percent of Medi-Cal enrollees will become eligible for Covered California during the course of a year because of income increases. On the other hand, about one in five people with subsidized Covered California plans will drop into Medi-Cal or other public coverage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you have a Covered California plan, you may be bumped into Medi-Cal when the agency attempts to verify your eligibility, said spokesman Dana Howard. This could happen midyear, when Covered California checks sources such as federal tax records to determine whether your income matches the estimate you gave when you enrolled. Last year, about 85,000 people were determined eligible for Medi-Cal during this process, he said.\n\nIf you\u2019re in Medi-Cal, you may fall off during the annual renewal process if you\u2019re no longer eligible or don\u2019t return your renewal materials, said Ren\u00e9 Mollow, deputy director of health care benefits and eligibility for the state Department of Health Care Services.\n\nIf you\u2019re in either program, you\u2019re supposed to report changes in income or family. If you do and your eligibility changes, you may be moved.\n\nUnfortunately, people are also falling off for incorrect and sometimes inexplicable reasons. For instance, the Covered California and Medi-Cal computer systems \u201caren\u2019t talking to each other very well,\u201d said Cori Racela, associate director of policy and litigation for Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles County.\n\n\u201cThe county will say one thing, and Covered California will say another thing. It\u2019s the consumer who falls between the cracks.\u201d\n\nMany consumers don\u2019t find out they\u2019ve been incorrectly switched until afterward, said Sonal Ambegaokar, senior attorney at the National Health Law Program. \u201cThere\u2019s often a gap in coverage before they can get reenrolled. During that time, they have medical needs that are not being addressed.\u201d\n\nMollow said Medi-Cal has to give members at least 10 days notice before they\u2019re disenrolled. If you don\u2019t receive adequate notice or disagree with the decision, you have appeal rights.\n\nRead the notice you receive in the mail carefully because it provides directions for appeal. But that\u2019s not your only option if you think there\u2019s been a mistake or need help.\n\n\u2022 Start with your county human services agency or Covered California (800-300-1506).\n\n\u2022 Request a Medi-Cal or Covered California eligibility hearing by calling 855-795-0634 if you disagree with a change in your benefits.\n\n\u2022 Reach out to the Health Consumer Alliance (888-804-3536), which provides consumer assistance across the state.\n\n\u2022 If you\u2019re going to report a change that affects your eligibility, whenever possible do it early in the month, Racela suggested. Because you can keep your current coverage through the month, reporting early will provide a cushion in case you encounter challenges when you enroll in the new program.\n\n\u2022 If you know you\u2019ll be switching programs and are taking prescription medications, consider asking your doctor to prescribe a three-month emergency supply in case there\u2019s a delay in refilling your prescription, Ambegaokar said.\n\n\u2022 If you\u2019re undergoing treatment when you lose eligibility in a program, you have \u201ccontinuity of care\u201d rights, noted Mollow. Once you\u2019ve been switched, contact your new health plan immediately to explain your situation. In some cases, you may be able to keep your doctor while your treatment proceeds.\n\nIf you\u2019d like to submit a query, email AskEmily@usc.edu.
