Iran plans to launch an initiative to get all its citizens covered by health insurance, President Hassan Rouhani announced on Twitter Wednesday.

Rouhani’s account, which is not controlled by him directly but is widely viewed as credible and has broken news on his actions in the past, threw in the hashtag #RouhaniCare, clearly an homage to Obamacare—President Barack Obama’s health care reform law—and perhaps an olive branch as the two countries try to expand on a landmark deal on Iran’s nuclear program.

The Islamic Republic already has a fairly extensive network of basic public clinics and health care is guaranteed to Iranians under the constitution.
