But this year the Chinese government seems somewhat ambivalent about celebrating Mao\u2019s disastrous achievements. It\u2019s about time.\n\nMany countries have a founding myth that inspires and sustains a national culture. We\u2019ve just seen South Africa and the world celebrate the accomplishments of Nelson Mandela, the founder of that nation\u2019s modern, multi-racial democracy. In the United States we look to the American Revolution and especially to the ideas in the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson, is the most eloquent libertarian essay in history, especially its philosophical core:\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u2013That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, \u2013That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.\n\nThe ideas of the Declaration, given legal form in the Constitution, took the United States of America from a small frontier outpost on the edge of the developed world to the richest country in the world in scarcely a century. The country failed in many ways to live up to the vision of the Declaration, notably in the institution of chattel slavery. But over the next two centuries that vision inspired Americans to extend the promises of the Declaration\u2014life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\u2014to more and more people.\n\nChina of course followed a different vision, the vision of Mao Zedong. Take Mao\u2019s speech on July 1, 1949, as his Communist armies neared victory. The speech was titled, \u201cOn the People\u2019s Democratic Dictatorship.\u201d Instead of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, it spoke of \u201cthe extinction of classes, state power and parties,\u201d of \u201ca socialist and communist society,\u201d of the nationalization of private enterprise and the socialization of agriculture, of a \u201cgreat and splendid socialist state\u201d in Russia, and especially of \u201ca powerful state apparatus\u201d in the hands of a \u201cpeople\u2019s democratic dictatorship.\u201d\n\nTragically, unbelievably, this vision appealed not only to many Chinese but even to Americans and Europeans, some of them prominent. But from the beginning it went terribly wrong, as really should have been predicted. Communism created desperate poverty in China. The \u201cGreat Leap Forward\u201d led to mass starvation. The Cultural Revolution unleashed \u201can extended paroxysm of revolutionary madness\u201d in which \u201ctens of millions of innocent victims were persecuted, professionally ruined, mentally deranged, physically maimed and even killed.\u201d Estimates of the number of unnatural deaths during Mao\u2019s tenure range from 15 million to 80 million. This is so monstrous that we can\u2019t really comprehend it. What inspired many American and European leftists was that Mao really seemed to believe in the communist vision. And the attempt to actually implement communism leads to disaster and death.\n\nWhen Mao died in 1976, China changed rapidly. His old comrade Deng Xiaoping, a victim of the Cultural Revolution, had learned something from the 30 years of calamity. He began to implement policies he called \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics,\u201d which looked a lot like freer markets \u2014 decollectivization and the \u201cresponsibility system\u201d in agriculture, privatization of enterprises, international trade, liberalization of residency requirements.\n\nThe changes in China over the past generation are the greatest story in the world\u2014more than a billion people brought from totalitarianism to a largely capitalist economic system that is eroding the continuing authoritarianism of the political system. On its 90th birthday, the CCP still rules China with an iron fist. There is no open political opposition, and no independent judges or media. And yet the economic changes are undermining the party\u2019s control, a challenge of which the party is well aware. Five years ago Howard W. French reported in the New York Times:\n\nPolitical change, however gradual and inconsistent, has made China a significantly more open place for average people than it was a generation ago. Much remains unfree here. The rights of public expression and assembly are sharply limited; minorities, especially in Tibet and Xinjiang Province, are repressed; and the party exercises a nearly complete monopoly on political decision making. But Chinese people also increasingly live where they want to live. They travel abroad in ever larger numbers. Property rights have found broader support in the courts. Within well-defined limits, people also enjoy the fruits of the technological revolution, from cellphones to the Internet, and can communicate or find information with an ease that has few parallels in authoritarian countries of the past.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party remains in control. But it struggles to protect its people from acquiring information, routinely battling with Google, Star TV, and other media. Howard French noted that \u201cthe country now has 165,000 registered lawyers, a five-fold increase since 1990, and average people have hired them to press for enforcement of rights inscribed in the Chinese Constitution.\u201d People get used to making their own decisions in many areas of life and wonder why they are restricted in other ways. I am hopeful that the 100th anniversary of the CCP in 2021 will be of interest mainly to historians of China\u2019s past and that the Chinese people will by then enjoy life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness under a government that derives its powers from the consent of the governed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Instead of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, Mao Zedong spoke of \u201cthe extinction of classes, state power and parties,\u201d of \u201ca socialist and communist society,\u201d of the nationalization of private enterprise, and especially of \u201ca powerful state apparatus\u201d in the hands of a \u201cpeople\u2019s democratic dictatorship.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "Instead of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, Mao Zedong spoke of \u201cthe extinction of classes, state power and parties,\u201d of \u201ca socialist and communist society,\u201d of the nationalization of private enterprise, and especially of \u201ca powerful state apparatus\u201d in the hands of a \u201cpeople\u2019s democratic dictatorship.\u201d", "title": "China Grapples with Mao Zedong's Legacy at His 120th Birthday", "url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/china-grapples-mao-zedongs-legacy-120th-birthday", "image": "http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/default_images/blog_torch_large.gif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.cato.org/blog/china-grapples-mao-zedongs-legacy-120th-birthday", "title": "China Grapples with Mao Zedong's Legacy at His 120th Birthday", "description": "Instead of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, Mao Zedong spoke of \u201cthe extinction of classes, state power and parties,\u201d of \u201ca socialist and communist society,\u201d of the nationalization of private enterprise, and especially of \u201ca powerful state apparatus\u201d in the hands of a \u201cpeople\u2019s democratic dictatorship.\u201d", "card": "summary", "creator": "@CatoInstitute"}, "robots": "noodp", "site": "Cato Institute", "node_creation_date": "2013/12/25", "fb": {"admins": 5311211, "app_id": 158687980817033}, "publication_date": "2013/12/26", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-26T08:21:55-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/davidboaz"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce898\"", "article_summary": "December 26 is the 120th anniversary of Mao Zedong\u2019s birth, typically a date of great celebration in China.\nChina of course followed a different vision, the vision of Mao Zedong.\nIn the United States we look to the American Revolution and especially to the ideas in the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776.\nWhat inspired many American and European leftists was that Mao really seemed to believe in the communist vision.\nOn its 90th birthday, the CCP still rules China with an iron fist."}
