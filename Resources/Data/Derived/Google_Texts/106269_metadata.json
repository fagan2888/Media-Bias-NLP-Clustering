Baiji is Iraq\u2019s largest oil refinery, and as such, is strategically important to the country for revenues and for domestic fuel supplies.\n\n\u201cIt actually also sits on a corridor that runs from the Tigris River valley to the Euphrates River valley. And so it's geographically significant as well as significant economically,\u201d the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey said at a press conference, offering up an explanation as to why the U.S. finds it so important to intervene. The U.S. is conducting air strikes on ISIS in order to aid Iraqi forces, but have thus far been unable to fully repel the attack.\n\nISIS had wrestled control of the refinery when Iraq was caught off guard in June 2014. They were subsequently pushed back with the help of U.S. airstrikes. Once again, however, ISIS is advancing. CNN reported on May 7 that Iraqi security forces only controlled about 20 percent of the facility, with the remaining 80 percent in the hands of ISIS. \u201cThe enemy has entered the Baiji refinery. They do control parts of it,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steven Warren told the press.\n\nRelated: How ISIS Regained Its Momentum in Iraq\n\nThe refinery has been offline for several months due to prior attacks. Its closurenearly halted the production of refined petroleum products in northern Iraq, not counting the semi-autonomous Kurdish region, which has fended off ISIS militants. The Baiji refinery, before its closure, was producing 200,000 barrels per day of refined products.\n\nThe advance of ISIS was largely halted in recent months, as combined attacks from Iran, Iraq, and the United States have taken their toll on the militant group. Aside from the Baiji refinery, Iraq\u2019s oil production has not been affected. In fact, Iraq has managed to increase oil exports in recent months \u2013 hitting a record highof 3.08 million barrels per day in April.\n\nStill, the Baiji refinery is crucial to Iraq\u2019s future. The loss of control to ISIS would leave the country\u2019s largest refinery in the militant group\u2019s hands. If ISIS decided to sabotage the facility, it would amount to a massive setback for Iraq\u2019s economy.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OilPrice.com\n\nRead more from OilPrice.com:\n\nIs This The Top For Oil Prices For Now?\n\nA Spanner In The Works Of The Solar Revolution\n\nDoes Russia Really Own 20% Of The US\u2019 Uranium Reserves?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The U.S. military is helping Iraqi forces pushback ISIS at a vital oil refinery.", "title": "ISIS Again Threatening Vital Iraqi Oil Refinery", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/08/ISIS-Again-Threatening-Vital-Iraqi-Oil-Refinery", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-airstrikes_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/08/ISIS-Again-Threatening-Vital-Iraqi-Oil-Refinery", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-airstrikes_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The U.S. military is helping Iraqi forces pushback ISIS at a vital oil refinery.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d6b\"", "article_summary": "The U.S. military is helping Iraqi forces pushback ISIS at a vital oil refinery.\nAside from the Baiji refinery, Iraq\u2019s oil production has not been affected.\nBaiji is Iraq\u2019s largest oil refinery, and as such, is strategically important to the country for revenues and for domestic fuel supplies.\nThe Baiji refinery, before its closure, was producing 200,000 barrels per day of refined products.\nThe U.S. is conducting air strikes on ISIS in order to aid Iraqi forces, but have thus far been unable to fully repel the attack."}
