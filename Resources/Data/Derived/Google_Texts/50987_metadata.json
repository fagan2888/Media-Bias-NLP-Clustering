The treatment dissolves fat in localized areas.\n\nBy Allison Bruce\n\nWhen Heidi Balog learned of a laser treatment that could help the body break down and eliminate fat in targeted areas of the body, she was ready to try it.\n\nBalog, who lives in Westwood, had the low-level laser treatments at Jonique Medical Aesthetic and Laser Center in Westlake Village. Balog has known owner Jonique Garcia for 17 years and trusted her opinion when it came to using the Lila Strawberry Laser.\n\nAfter 10 treatments, Balog said she was pleased with the results, which targeted her upper abdomen, an area she had been self-conscious about for some time.\n\nBalog previously had liposuction on her lower abdomen. Liposuction can have tricky results, since it removes fat cells and new fat can be unevenly distributed to where the liposuction didn\u2019t remove cells.\n\n\u201cI needed something very specific,\u201d Balog said. \u201cI tried exercise and diet, but it didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nSo she purchased a $2,000 package deal of 10 treatments for the price of eight. She said the treatments, which involve placing a belt of paddles over the area to be treated, were quick and easy.\n\n\u201cYou just lie there and don\u2019t feel anything,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe a little warmth.\u201d\n\nAfter that, she stood on a whole-body vibration machine, which helps the body process and eliminate the fat removed by the treatment.\n\nEach area treated receives the laser light for 10 minutes per treatment, Garcia said. She has men and women undergoing the treatment, with the abdomen the most common target area.\n\nClient Celia Kahn of Calabasas also wanted to lose stubborn fat around her stomach. She said now her pants fit better than before.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, you still have to watch what you eat,\u201d she said. \u201cLike anything else in life, you can\u2019t just get these treatments and eat chocolates and fatty stuff. The treatments work with conscious exercising and proper eating.\u201d\n\nAlong those lines, Garcia doesn\u2019t just offer a quick-fix laser treatment. The price of the treatments includes access to the gym in her medical building with services ranging from Pilates to dance classes to meeting with personal trainers. She also gives clients vitamin shots and access to a nutritionist.\n\nBalog exercises regularly. She continues to work out at her own gym, but also goes to the dance classes at the Westlake Village studio.\n\nGarcia sees the LiLa laser as a way to target a trouble spot, but also a way to jump-start a new commitment to healthy eating and exercise.\n\nFor Garcia, who started offering the treatments at the end of last year, the timing seemed right for those looking to make a change.\n\n\u201cThis is when people are getting serious,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether they stay serious or not is another story.\u201d\n\nAt health and fitness clubs, memberships spike in January, with 12 percent of all memberships signed that month, according to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association. But at the same time that 88 percent of adults say they have not been satisfied with their weight or body shape at some point in their lives, 40 percent said they needed help starting a fitness program, according to the \u201cWeight of the Union\u201d report from Anytime Fitness.\n\nThe end of one year and beginning of another often marks a time for those kinds of commitments, which may be a good thing, said Michelle Moon, a clinical psychologist and associate professor at CSU Channel Islands.\n\nThe holidays often give people time to take stock, she said.\n\n\u201cPeople look at the new year as a chance to sort of get back on track from where they are,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing to figure out what\u2019s not working in your life and make the adjustment.\u201d\n\nGarcia said she finds that clients come to her center before the holidays wanting truly quick fixes, such as some Botox to minimize lines, so they feel good about how they look at holiday parties and while visiting friends and family.\n\nAt the start of the new year, however, she said she sees more clients thinking about the long-term and wanting treatments that fit with goals to be healthier and look better. They\u2019re thinking about the way they look and feel and starting off fresh, she said.\n\n\u201cSomebody who is seriously coming in and trying to get healthy \u2014 it\u2019s a rapid way to get there,\u201d Garcia said of the laser treatment. \u201cIt makes it much more enticing to be on a diet and see results rapidly.\u201d\n\nMoon said a treatment that helps get the body looking more like someone wants can be a good motivator and create a more positive outlook. Dieting and exercise is a slow process, and, while it can lead to long-term health benefits, it can be hard to stay with for an extended period of time, she said.\n\nA little bit of motivation \u2014 perhaps through seeing results in areas that just didn\u2019t change enough with diet and exercise \u2014 can help people remain committed to those long-term goals.\n\n\u201cPeople are really hard on themselves and each other,\u201d Moon said. \u201cI think, when people find something that works, that can be a good thing \u2014 whatever that is.\u201d\n\nThis story is part of an occasional series on how Ventura County technology companies are impacting people.
