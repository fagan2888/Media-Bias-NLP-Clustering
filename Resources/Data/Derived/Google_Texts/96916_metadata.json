Mitch McConnell, whose Democratic opponent has flooded Kentucky\u2019s airwaves with ads that essentially accuse him of favoring violence against women. Alison Lundergan Grimes has repeated this attack on the campaign trail in an unsubtle bid to open up a decisive gender gap that has yet to materialize, according to a recent poll. McConnell\u2019s campaign is up with a response ad starring McConnell\u2019s wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao:\n\n\u201cHave you ever noticed how some liberals feel entitled to speak on behalf of all women, as if every woman agrees with Barack Obama? \u2026 Supporting the Obama agenda isn\u2019t pro-woman. It\u2019s anti-Kentucky.\u201d\n\nThe spot highlights the fact that McConnell co-sponsored the original Violence Against Women Act, and that he supported alternative versions of the recently-updated law, which the ad says would have provided \u201cstronger protections for women than Obama\u2019s agenda will allow.\u201d The Atlantic\u2019s Molly Ball looked into why some conservatives objected to the re-authorization of VAWA in recent years, and discovered that \u2014 surprise! \u2014 they harbored substantive concerns about a handful of elements within the bill\u2019s legislative language:\n\nThe act\u2019s grants have encouraged states to implement \u201cmandatory-arrest\u201d policies, under which police responding to domestic-violence calls are required to make an arrest. These policies were intended to combat the too-common situation in which a victim is intimidated into recanting an abuse accusation, or officers defer to the \u201cman of the house\u201d and fail to take an abuse claim seriously. But Villegas and other critics say mandatory-arrest laws can backfire. A 2007 study found that states with such laws saw increases in intimate-partner homicides \u2014 perhaps because they made victims, who may have wanted the police to intervene without making an arrest, less likely to report abuse before it could escalate out of control. Villegas points to this as an example of VAWA funds being distributed in ways that are well-intentioned but not necessarily best for victims. Critics also say VAWA has been subject to waste, fraud, and abuse because of insufficient oversight. For example, a Department of Justice audit found that out of 22 randomly selected VAWA grantees, 21 had violated the terms of their grants. Another controversy surrounds a provision in this year\u2019s reauthorization to give tribal governments criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians who commit crimes on reservations. Proponents of the bill say this closes a loophole that allows non-Native American men to abuse Indian women with impunity. But critics say the tribal courts are underresourced and have a history of failing to provide adequate legal protections to defendants. Other controversial new proposals in reauthorizing the act have included a prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and an expansion of the visa program that grants permanent residency to immigrant victims of abuse. Villegas and others say this latter change opens the door to immigration fraud. In the Senate hearings on VAWA, an American woman testified that her Czech husband falsely accused her of spousal abuse in order to gain residency when they divorced. Because of the law\u2019s protections for \u201cvictims,\u201d Julie Poner claimed, she had no recourse to rebut the allegations, and her children were taken from her and put in foster care.\n\nOther Republicans called into question a provision involving Native American tribal courts and US legal sovereignty. In other words, lawmakers like McConnell raised legitimate issues, including documented unintended consequences and verifiable fraud. Grimes is counting on Kentucky women to jump to her misleading conclusion that the Senate Republican Leader simply isn\u2019t interested combating misogyny and violent abuse. Chao is an effective voice in her husband\u2019s defense; she puts a woman\u2019s face on the other side of the issue, and counter-attacks by relentlessly linking Grimes to the deeply unpopular president. In a fit of pique over the new ad, a Democratic operative in the state posted explicitly racial tweets questioning Chao\u2019s status as a true Kentuckian:\n\nMs. Groob\u2019s Twitter account has since been deleted. A liberal group came under fire last year for attacking Chao\u2019s ethnicity, fulminating that she could be the reason why Kentuckians\u2019 jobs \u201cmoved to China.\u201d Chao is from Taiwan. Another major Grimes supporter \u2014 state House Speaker Greg Stumbo \u2014 compared McConnell to Nazis earlier this year. He refused to apologize, and Grimes declined to condemn the incendiary remarks. Perhaps Grimes\u2019 greatest asset in this race is her maiden name. She\u2019s the daughter of a prominent Kentucky Democrat. She certainly hasn\u2019t demonstrated a strong grasp of the issues; last week, she ignorantly claimed that Israel\u2019s \u2018Iron Dome\u2019 missile defense system has helped repel Hamas\u2019 tunnel attacks. At another rally, she urged supporters to put bumper stickers in their yards \u2014 a silly, but ill-timed, mistake. On a more substantive level, Grimes is an abortion extremist, even opposing bipartisan efforts to restrict abortions after the fifth month of pregnancy. Her behind-the-scenes rhetoric on a range of \u2018progressive\u2019 issue has won Grimes the ardent backing of lefty hardliners like Elizabeth Warren. If Grimes overcomes both her own liberalism and Obama\u2019s unpopularity in the state to defeat McConnell, Republicans can likely kiss the prospect of a Senate majority goodbye.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Dem: Chao \u201cisn\u2019t from KY, she is Asian.\u201d", "title": "Video: McConnell\u2019s wife punches back against \u2018anti-women\u2019 attacks in new ad", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/08/05/video-mcconnells-wife-punches-back-against-anti-women-attacks-in-new-ad/", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/uploads/2014/8/4/8.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@hotairblog"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "2014 election, Alison Lundergan Grimes, Kentucky, Mitch McConnell, War on Women,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-05T20:41:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-05T19:15:33+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1206\"", "article_summary": "Critics also say VAWA has been subject to waste, fraud, and abuse because of insufficient oversight.\nProponents of the bill say this closes a loophole that allows non-Native American men to abuse Indian women with impunity.\nBut critics say the tribal courts are underresourced and have a history of failing to provide adequate legal protections to defendants.\nAnother major Grimes supporter \u2014 state House Speaker Greg Stumbo \u2014 compared McConnell to Nazis earlier this year.\nHer behind-the-scenes rhetoric on a range of \u2018progressive\u2019 issue has won Grimes the ardent backing of lefty hardliners like Elizabeth Warren."}
