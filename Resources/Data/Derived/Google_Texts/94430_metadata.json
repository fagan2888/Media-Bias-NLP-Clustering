It\u2019s \u201ca vindication of what Kaiser mental health clinicians have been saying for years.\u201d\n\nPapazian was one of several Kaiser clinicians lined up to testify in the hearings, slated to run through early October. The clinicians have complained that they weren\u2019t able to offer individual therapy appointments in a timely manner to patients with severe depression, anxiety and other conditions, sometimes leading to wait times of up to four weeks or more between appointments. Others say patients were directed to group therapy, even in cases where the patient wasn\u2019t receptive to group therapy and requested individual care.\n\nThe National Union of Healthcare Workers, which represents mental health professionals at Kaiser, argued that these wait times and policies led to tragic outcomes, even suicide, in some cases.\n\n\u201cKaiser simply does not staff its psychiatry departments with enough psychologists, therapists and social workers to handle the caseload,\u201d said Sal Rosselli, the union\u2019s president, adding that the caseload is only increasing as more and more people sign up for Kaiser\u2019s coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nKaiser issued a lengthy statement saying that even though it agreed to pay the fine, it still disagreed with the penalty and believed it had not violated regulations around timely access.\n\nThe health plan vowed to make statewide improvements, including more convenient appointment times and locations, and adding more individual therapy. It says that over the years, it has been \u201ccontinually analyzing our staffing levels throughout our care delivery system, and hiring appropriate mental health providers to meet growth in membership and our members\u2019 needs.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care says it is currently conducting a follow-up survey of Kaiser\u2019s mental health systems, to be completed this fall. Any remaining deficiencies will be addressed through corrective action plans, penalties or even the installation of a monitor.\n\n\u201cI am committed to protecting California\u2019s health plan enrollees and ensuring they get timely access to all medically necessary health and mental health care services,\u201d said Shelley Rouillard, the department director, \u201cand will continue to aggressively monitor and take action against health plans that violate the law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Union had argued that long wait times for therapy appointments sometimes led to tragic outcomes.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Kaiser Agrees to Pay $4 Million Fine Over Mental Health Care\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/09\\/09\\/kaiser-agrees-to-pay-4-million-fine-over-mental-health-care-drops-lawsuit\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-09 11:18:38\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-09-10 13:50:33\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":21358,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Kaiser\"],\"categories\":[\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/08\\/5371998566_179533eed7_z.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Union had argued that long wait times for therapy appointments sometimes led to tragic outcomes.", "title": "Kaiser Agrees to Pay $4 Million Fine Over Mental Health Care", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/09/09/kaiser-agrees-to-pay-4-million-fine-over-mental-health-care-drops-lawsuit/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/08/5371998566_179533eed7_z.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "kaiser", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Kaiser Permanente agreed to pay a $4 million fine over claims that it did not provide adequate access to mental health care services for its patients.\nIt\u2019s \u201ca vindication of what Kaiser mental health clinicians have been saying for years.\u201dPapazian was one of several Kaiser clinicians lined up to testify in the hearings, slated to run through early October.\n\u201cI am committed to protecting California\u2019s health plan enrollees and ensuring they get timely access to all medically necessary health and mental health care services,\u201d said Shelley Rouillard, the department director, \u201cand will continue to aggressively monitor and take action against health plans that violate the law.\u201d\nIt says that over the years, it has been \u201ccontinually analyzing our staffing levels throughout our care delivery system, and hiring appropriate mental health providers to meet growth in membership and our members\u2019 needs.\u201dThe state\u2019s Department of Managed Health Care says it is currently conducting a follow-up survey of Kaiser\u2019s mental health systems, to be completed this fall.\nThe health plan vowed to make statewide improvements, including more convenient appointment times and locations, and adding more individual therapy."}
