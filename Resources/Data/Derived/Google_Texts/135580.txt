× Woman served bag containing thousands in cash at Burger King drive-through

ROCHESTER, N.H. — A New Hampshire woman opened her bag of fast food on Friday afternoon to discover that Burger King workers had gotten her order wrong.

Instead of a spicy chicken sandwich, Janelle Jones discovered a bundle of cash totaling $2,631 as she left the drive-through.

Jones called her husband in disbelief, Foster’s Daily Democrat reported. Eventually, the couple decided to give the money back.

“It felt a lot better than keeping it,” Jones told the Associated Press.

Matthew Jones said the couple briefly considered keeping the cash, which he admitted they could’ve used.

But, he told the Democrat, he and his wife are Jehovah’s Witnesses, and “Jehovah sees everything.”

Burger King employees confirmed that the story was true, but declined to give any further comment, the AP reported.
