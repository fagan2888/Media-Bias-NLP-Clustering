ORR explains that states may not refuse ORR-funded benefits for refugees on the basis of religion and national origin.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cAccordingly, states may not categorically deny ORR-funded benefits and services to Syrian refugees,\u201d ORR Director Robert Carey wrote in the letter. \u201cAny state with such a policy would not be in compliance with the State Plan requirements, applicable statutes, and their own assurances, and could be subject to enforcement action, including suspension and termination.\u201d\n\nThe agency also pointed to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prohibiting discrimination for federally funded assistance benefits. Refugees are immediately eligible for welfare and other benefits upon admission to the U.S.\n\n\u201cThus, it is not permissible to deny federally funded benefits such as Medicaid or [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families] to refugees who otherwise meet the eligibilities requirements,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cORR is committed to ensuring that all refugees receive assistance and services vital to achieving their potential in the United States and becoming self-sufficient, integrated members of our communities.\u201d\n\nORR acknowledged in its letter the concerns dozens of governors and lawmakers have raised about the potential for terrorist to infiltrate the refugee process, be placed in their states, and threaten their constituents.\n\n\u201cORR is aware that state and local leaders, including some governors, have expressed concern about the resettlement of Syrian refugees in their states. In light go these concerns, we note that the resettlement process begins with the work of our federal agency partners in screening and vetting refugees,\u201d Carey wrote.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) slammed the Obama administration for its aggressive stance toward concerned states.\n\n\u201cWhile the United States has the most generous refugee system in the world, the American people are rightly concerned about admitting Syrian refugees and the impact it would have on the safety of their families and neighbors,\u201d Goodlatte said in a statement. \u201cIn light of these concerns, the majority of state governors have taken positions that reflect the views of their residents.\u201d\n\nHe further criticized the administration as \u201chypocritical\u201d for threatening states that might not comply with refugee resettlement while turning a blind eye to sanctuary cities \u2014 that refuse to cooperate with immigration enforcement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama admin has warned states to comply with federal efforts to resettle Syrian refugees or their states face enforcement action.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The Obama admin has warned states to comply with federal efforts to resettle Syrian refugees or their states face enforcement action.", "title": "Obama: Admit Syrian Refugees or Face \u2018Enforcement Action\u2019", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/GREECE-MACEDONIA-EUROPE-MIGRANTS-Getty.png", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/27/obama-administration-threatens-states-admit-syrian-refugees-face-enforcement-action/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Obama admin has warned states to comply with federal efforts to resettle Syrian refugees or their states face enforcement action.", "title": "Obama: Admit Syrian Refugees or Face \u2018Enforcement Action\u2019", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/GREECE-MACEDONIA-EUROPE-MIGRANTS-Getty.png", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bob Goodlatte, immigration, Office of Refugee Resettlement, Syrian refugees,Big Government, Immigration, Obama,Syrian refugees", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Syrian refugees", "published_time": "2015-11-27T09:29:59-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration,Obama"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Obama administration has warned states to comply with federal efforts to resettle Syrian refugees in communities around the U.S. or else find their states subject to enforcement action.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cAccordingly, states may not categorically deny ORR-funded benefits and services to Syrian refugees,\u201d ORR Director Robert Carey wrote in the letter.\n\u201cORR is aware that state and local leaders, including some governors, have expressed concern about the resettlement of Syrian refugees in their states.\nORR explains that states may not refuse ORR-funded benefits for refugees on the basis of religion and national origin.\nIn a letter this week, the Office of Refugee Resettlement threatens states concerned about resettling Syrians with punitive responses if they refuse to accept the refugees."}
