Two hundred and twenty-seven years to the month after he proposed that theory, we have yet another case study to prove it.\n\nCongress has until the end of the month to extend or modify the Patriot Act, passed in the panicky aftermath of 9/11. One of the sticking points has been the dragnet surveillance of Americans\u2019 telephone activity by the National Security Administration that Edward Snowden exposed to the world two years ago. Last Thursday, a three-judge federal appeals panel unanimously found that the data collection program violates the Patriot Act\u2014specifically, Section 215.\n\nSection 215 has been hugely controversial, since it allows the authorities to demand \u201ctangible things\u201d such as books, papers, records and \u201cother items\u201d in the pursuit of an investigation, without explaining why, and to insist that the party handing over the records keep silent about the request. As has been pointed out often since, this means the library has to hand over your borrowing records without telling you.\n\nThis was the nail the NSA hung its hat on when it created the bulk metadata-collection program. But as the Second Circuit\u2019s Gerard Lynch wrote in his ruling, while there are supposed to be \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to think the information requested is \u201crelevant\u201d to a national-security investigation, the NSA simply took the position that it could collect everyone\u2019s records so long as it focused on only some of them. Rather like Schrodinger\u2019s cat, everything is relevant and not-relevant until the NSA acts on it.\n\nThe Patriot Act vastly expanded government power. And yet, for the NSA, it did not go far enough. It is helpful to have the Second Circuit slap the agency down, but the courts are not always so constraining. The Supreme Court certainly was not when, in a series of cases culminating with Kelo v. New London in 2005, it gradually unmoored the language of the Fifth Amendment from the purpose for which it was written.\n\nUnder the Fifth Amendment, government can take private property only for \u201cpublic use.\u201d In cases concerning blight and the breaking up of land oligopolies, \u201cpublic use\u201d became \u201cpublic purpose.\u201d Then, in Kelo, public purpose became public benefit, even in cases where the property taken went to another private party, rather than the public: So long as the government could assert that the seizure would, someday and however indirectly, redound to the common good, the taking qualified as one for public use.\n\nThe High Court did much the same in Wickard v. Filburn. Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce, and it did so during the Depression when it set limits on the amount of wheat farmers could grow in order to boost prices.\n\nRoscoe Filburn grew more than allowed, but he argued that because the excess was for his own consumption and not for sale, it never entered the stream of commerce, and was therefore exempt from congressional oversight. The Supremes said otherwise: Growing his own wheat allowed Filburn to avoid buying some on the market, and that had at least an indirect effect on interstate commerce by altering the total demand for wheat, so Congress could regulate Filburn\u2019s private use as well.\n\nThat line of reasoning came in quite handy for defenders of Obamacare. Opponents of the law\u2019s individual mandate said forcing people to buy something (in this case, an insurance policy) represented a gross expansion of government power, and Congress had no authority to do so.\n\nSupporters said Congress did, because the failure to buy something still affects commerce. In short, \u201cWickard v. Filburn, therefore your argument is invalid.\u201d The Supreme Court didn\u2019t buy that, but it allowed the individual mandate to remain anyway, on the theory that the penalty for not buying insurance was, in actuality, a tax. (And never mind President Obama\u2019s emphatic insistence otherwise.)\n\nSoon the Supreme Court will rule on another aspect of Obamacare: whether people who buy insurance through a federal exchange are entitled to subsidies. The Affordable Care Act says such subsidies are available only to those who buy insurance through \u201can Exchange established by the State.\u201d Obamacare opponents say the federal government is not a state, so subsidies aren\u2019t available on federal exchanges.\n\nMany defenders of Obamacare insist this is simply a drafting error that would have been cleaned up in conference committee, if the bill had gone to one (it didn\u2019t). That\u2019s not what the federal government argues, though. In court, the government contends that the words \u201cestablished by the State\u201d can mean either an exchange established by the state or an exchange established by the federal government in place of the state.\n\nThanks to the ACA\u2019s ghastly incoherence, you can make a plausible argument for either side. But the argument for the broader interpretation relies on stretching the meaning of words in a manner that would make the NSA whistle with admiration.\n\nFinally, another dispute in the legal community at present concerns occupational speech: Whether veterinarians, psychiatrists, tour guides, and so forth must get a permission slip from the government before practicing their trades, whether doctors can be forbidden to ask their patients about guns in the home, and so on. The libertarian Institute for Justice says such requirements impinge on the First Amendment.\n\nLining up on the other side are a phalanx of government regulators and Yale law professor Robert Post. In a recent exchange in the Harvard Law Review forum, Post fretted that, should the libertarian view of such matters prevail, \u201cthe First Amendment (would be) transformed into a straitjacket for our institutions of democratic governance.\u201d\n\nWhen an amendment begins \u201cCongress shall make no law. . . \u201c one might reasonably conclude that constraining democratic institutions is precisely the point. But to advocates of big government, the plain and obvious meaning of the text is a nuisance.\n\nThe common thread running through all of these issues is the conjunction between the expansion of power and the distortion of ordinary meaning. Orwell warned about that very thing nearly seven decades ago in \u201cPolitics and the English Language,\u201d when he wrote that \u201cpolitical speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible.\u201d In that he was, like Jefferson, prescient.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Lawmakers and the courts keep chipping away at our liberty.", "title": "Big Government Continues Eroding the Constitution", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/05/18/how-big-government-erodes-the-constituti", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14319620961669.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14319620961669.jpg", "description": "Lawmakers and the courts keep chipping away at our liberty.", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Big Government Continues Eroding the Constitution"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-05-18T16:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/a-barton-hinkle"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3333\"", "article_summary": "Soon the Supreme Court will rule on another aspect of Obamacare: whether people who buy insurance through a federal exchange are entitled to subsidies.\nBut to advocates of big government, the plain and obvious meaning of the text is a nuisance.\nLast Thursday, a three-judge federal appeals panel unanimously found that the data collection program violates the Patriot Act\u2014specifically, Section 215.\nAs has been pointed out often since, this means the library has to hand over your borrowing records without telling you.\nCongress has until the end of the month to extend or modify the Patriot Act, passed in the panicky aftermath of 9/11."}
