Hardly, like IBM and other business icons in trouble, the Arkansas retailer is simply being squeezed by better competitors\u2014and mostly Americans\u2014who herald a new age of American innovation.\n\nWal-Mart\u2019s recipe for success was simple. Through a detailed knowledge of supplier costs, disciplined supply chain management and low wages for store personnel it bargained hard with manufacturers and delivered goods at the lowest prices.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nUnfortunately, its methods were hardly occult and others like Dollar General and Target caught on, undermining the Arkansas behemoth\u2019s competitive edge. Moreover, along with other big employers like McDonald\u2019s, Wal-Mart is under increasing social political pressure to pay workers more.\n\nWal-Mart attributes 75 percent of its drop in projected earnings to raising entry level wages to $9 an hour, but employers don\u2019t get much paying a single mom so little. Shoppers complain its stores are unfriendly, messy and often poorly stocked.\n\nOther bargain retailers are suffering a similar malaise, because millennials\u2014and older folks willing to change buying habits\u2014can get better products, cheaper on-line.\n\nFor $99 a year, Amazon Prime provides prime-time TV and free shipping directly from the folks that make products. That virtual marketplace offers more choice, competition that drives down prices, and cuts out altogether the retail supply chain\u2014shipping to warehouses and stores, and retailers inventory carrying costs. That drives consumer prices to their lowest possible level.\n\nBrick and mortar is not going away but simply when consumers know exactly what they want they can save even more by avoiding the cost and pain of negotiating Wal-Mart\u2019s congested parking lots and \u201ccourteous\u201d employees.\n\nAlas, much the same is happening over at IBM.\n\nThe tech giant\u2019s competitive advantage was in helping moderate-sized and large companies manage on-site computing, software and related services\u2014and then using the resulting access to hawk its mainframes, software and businesses services, such as Lotus Notes email and artificial intelligence systems.\n\nUnfortunately for IBM and traditional rivals Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Oracle, businesses large and small can rent or lease computer services more cheaply on \u201cthe cloud\u201d\u2014on-line, just like discount granola bars.\n\nAmazon Web Services leads by offering 10-times the cloud computing capacity as the next 14 largest rivals combined and boasts clients like General Electric, BMW and Capital One.\n\nAWS is building a marketplace for software and services from a wide range of suppliers\u2014with obvious advantages over an IBM consultant who has an interest in hawking Big Blue\u2019s offerings.\n\nMany other firms like Juniper Networks, Equinix and Red Hat are also offer computing power, software and other services on the web.\n\nBoth Wal-Mart and IBM are moving what they do to the web and cloud but both have CEOs more comfortable with another age and executives who feel entitlement to out-sized compensation their revenue and earnings trends indicate they hardly deserve.\n\nThe good news is that so many of the leaders in e-commerce, and the infrastructures of data management, computing, software and business services that define the cloud, are American.\n\nThe story repeats in so many places\u2014Tesla, not BMW or Toyota, with electric cars that break performance meters, and Twitter and Facebook that turn all of humanity into a village square.\n\nWe entered the 21st Century being told by so many economists and pundits this would be the Asian Century. China\u2019s woes and inept leadership throw cold water on that thinking.\n\nJust as in Henry Ford\u2019s age, the future belongs to people with a \u201cbetter idea.\u201d\n\nThankfully, many of those are the American entrepreneurs who are defining a New American Century.\n\nPeter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.
