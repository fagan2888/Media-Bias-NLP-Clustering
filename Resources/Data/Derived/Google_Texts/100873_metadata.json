A new report has revealed that while overall survival rates of women with breast cancer has increased over a period of 20 years, the survival rates of black women with breast cancer has significantly dropped. However, instead of looking at genetic differences to account for this increasing discrepancy between black and white breast cancer survivals rates, researchers turned to socio-economic factors for the answer. What they found is a shocking reflection of the racial divide that still exists in the United States.\n\nThe study was conducted on the 50 largest cities in the United States and spanned a time period of 20 years. It compared the breast cancer mortality rates of American women from the 1990s to mortality rates in the 2000s. Results found that although a gap between white and black mortality rates due to breast cancer existed in the 1990s, it had significantly widened nearly ten years later, Reuters reported. A lack of consistency in the widening gap throughout the surveyed cities invalidated DNA playing a role. For example, in New York City, the largest city to participate in the study, the gap in mortality rates stayed constantly at 18 percent, while the rate in Memphis, Tenn. started at 27 percent and more than doubled by the second survey. \u201cIf genetics were responsible\u2026 we would not have seen the rates go from being nearly equal in most places at the first time point to being so much worse for black women than white women at the last point,\u201d Bijou Hunt, lead author of the report, told Reuters.\n\nSince the 1990s there have been many more advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. This has accounted for the overall decrease in mortality rates. However the truth stands that black women were more likely to be uninsured and therefore do not have access to these life-saving technologies. \u201cMost of the disparities are actually due to access to care and access to quality care. This is an ethical and moral problem that we in the United States have yet to come to grips with,\u201d Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, told Reuters.\n\nFrom this study, it is hoped that the socio-economic differences, which have caused this widening gap between black and white breast cancer survival rates, can be addressed and mended. \u201cThis is not new science; this is getting old science to the people who deserve it because they are human beings. This is where we as a society are failing,\" Brawley said.\n\nSource: Hunt BR, Whitman S, Hurlbert MS.
