CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) â€” A South Carolina judge is being asked to delay the state death-penalty trial of Dylann Roof, who is charged with nine counts of murder in last year's Charleston church shootings.

Defense attorneys say starting the trial as scheduled on July 11 won't give them enough time to mount an adequate defense for Roof, who's charged with shooting the parishioners during a Bible study.

Circuit Judge J.C. Nicholson set the July trial date last summer, giving both the prosecution and the defense just under a year to prepare. He holds a hearing Wednesday on the request to delay.

A jury pool of 600 is to report June 28 for initial screening. Questioning of individual potential jurors and seating the jury starts July 11.
