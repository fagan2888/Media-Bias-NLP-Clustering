Today Woodson serves a population of 2,200 students and is an important part of the social fabric within the Washington metropolitan area. Something, though, has gone seriously haywire there as evidenced by the recent actions of sophomore Jack Chen reported in The Washington Post. This captain of the junior varsity football team who had never tried drugs and maintained a 4.3 grade-point average \u2014 this exceptional 15-year-old boy by every measure chose to bloodily end his life one weekday morning by stepping in front of a train filled with commuters hurling toward their city destination.\n\nAlthough his death is a tragic blow in and of itself, what makes it even more painful is the fact that his is one of six suicides at Woodson \u2014 another boy was found dead the following day \u2014 during the past three years. Christine Moutier, chief medical officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, explained that suicide clusters can impact other students, especially when amplified on social media. \u201cThe thing we are always concerned about is the phenomenon of suicide contagion,\u201d Moutier told The Post.\n\nAs described by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), suicide contagion occurs when exposure to suicide or suicidal behavior influences others to commit or attempt suicide. A study conducted in 2013 by researchers at Harvard School of Public Health explored this issue and found that \u201cexposure to suicide predicts suicide ideation and attempts.\u201d This particular investigation surveyed a total of 8,766 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 13, another 7,802 students between the ages of 14 and 15, and 5,496 students between the ages of 16 and 17. In all groups, exposure to a schoolmate's suicide was linked to increased numbers of students reporting thoughts of suicide, and also increased attempts. Worse, in its report, the CDC found that the effect of contagion may not be confined to suicides occurring in \u201cdiscrete geographic areas,\u201d but coverage of suicide in newspapers and on TV may also trigger an excess of suicides.\n\nThe American Foundation for Suicide Prevention recommends those left grieving in the wake of a suicide find support in order to work through their own feelings. If suicide does at times work as a contagion, those who may be susceptible need to build their immunity against it. And that can be done by reaching out to members of a support group, a therapist, or simply a friend.\n\nThe note Jack Chen left expressed love for his family and friends and his dream of becoming a computer science professor as well as a dad. Yet The Post also reported that he wrote, \u201cThere is too much stress in my life from school and the environment it creates, expectations for sports, expectations from my friends and expectations from my family.\u201d Jack\u2019s father speculated that his son\u2019s skin medication, which can cause depression, might have played a role. Unfortunately, Jack did not overtly display his feelings. \u201cThere was something going on in his mind, but he didn\u2019t give me any chance to do anything,\u201d Jim Chen told The Post.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "suicide, teens, contagious, jack chen, woodson high school, virginia", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Suicide clusters can impact other students, especially when amplified on social media.
