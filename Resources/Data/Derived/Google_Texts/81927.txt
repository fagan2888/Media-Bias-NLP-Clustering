Convicted cop killer Ross Lane died late Thursday night, the Kansas Dept. of Corrections (KDOC) confirmed.

Prison staff found the 32-year-old Lane unresponsive in his cell at El Dorado Correctional Facility around 10:30 a.m. on Thursday, according to KDOC. They immediately began trying to revive him until emergency responders arrived to take over. Lane was pronounced dead just before 11:00 a.m.

KDOC's confirmation comes after a Facebook page originally created to support Lane was updated with news of his death.

Following state law, prison officials notified the Kansas Bureau of Investigation of Lane's death. With a KBI investigation underway, KDOC provided no other information about Lane's death.

Lane pleaded guilty to shooting and killing TPD Corporal Jason Harwood during a September 2014 traffic stop.
