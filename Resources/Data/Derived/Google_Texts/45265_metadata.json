These days, Christian entertainment isn\u2019t just the didactic \u201c700 Club\u201d \u2014 it includes spectacles as high-flying as History\u2019s miniseries \u201cThe Bible\u201d or as wacky as GSN\u2019s \u201cAmerican Bible Challenge.\u201d If these entertainments, relying as they do on knowledge of the source material, do any converting, that\u2019s a fringe benefit; they exist to further galvanize the faithful in their beliefs.\n\nAmerican atheists haven\u2019t learned from these projects, it seems. The recently-launched AtheistTV, which is available over the Internet and through the Roku streaming device, frames itself as an outreach project of sorts. It consists of acquired programming (for instance, from the Richard Dawkins Institute), with call-in shows and broadcasts of speeches and rallies. All of these set forth the tenets of atheism \u2014 there\u2019s no \u201cAmerican Bible Challenge\u201d-style tomfoolery here.\n\nAnd yet after watching four hours of its programming and even despite my own lack of religious belief, I find it hard to imagine that even a casual nonbeliever would tune in, let alone someone on the fence about the existence of a higher power. AtheistTV adheres to nasty stereotypes about atheism \u2014 smugness, gleeful disregard for others\u2019 beliefs \u2014 to a degree that\u2019s close to unwatchable.\n\nWhen I first tuned in at 2 p.m. on Thursday, the closing credits for a show were scrolling, set to a parody hymn that rhymed \u201cDon\u2019t be offended by a word to the wise\u201d with \u201cThere\u2019s no real estate in the skies.\u201d Then, after several seconds of dead air, came a prerecorded call-in show called \u201cThe Atheist Experience,\u201d whose co-host Matt Dillahunty, wearing a black Hawaiian-style shirt decorated with flames and infinity symbols, needed no prompting to begin his show with the Biblical story of God asking Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac. \u201cThis is just absolutely horrible,\u201d said Dillahunty. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the type of thing we get when we begin with the idea that the Bible is true and good, and you run into absurdities.\u201d\n\nWhat absurdities these were the viewer would have to fill in for himself; there was no extrapolation from this story in terms of what social ills have happened in the name of God, no sense that Dillahunty was bothered by people following the Bible for any reason other than that he thinks it\u2019s nuts to rely on a book for wisdom and guidance. \u201cI don\u2019t worship any being,\u201d he said, \u201cthough I respect a lot of people and a lot of fictional characters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you know why your God is so stupid,\u201d he said, \u201cfeel free and call us.\u201d\n\nThe show did field one call, from a young man whose thoughts were so muddled (he was introduced as devout, then explained he was questioning his faith, then said he\u2019d been dead for a week, then said he often thought the world would be better off after he died) that it\u2019s not really fair to criticize. But it\u2019s worth noting that Dillahunty repeatedly suggested he was dealing with a prank caller but refused to disengage and make time for a caller who might have done a better job of representing himself; it was more important to score rhetorical points off someone clearly not equipped to play.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Atheist streaming network apparently learned nothing from Neil deGrasse Tyson's success", "title": "I spent a day watching AtheistTV \u2014 and it was horrifying", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The Atheist streaming network apparently learned nothing from Neil deGrasse Tyson's success", "title": "I spent a day watching AtheistTV \u2014 and it was horrifying", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/09/i_spent_a_day_watching_atheisttv_and_it_was_horrifying/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/atheist_experience.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Atheist streaming network apparently learned nothing from Neil deGrasse Tyson's success", "title": "I spent a day watching AtheistTV \u2014 and it was horrifying", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/atheist_experience.jpg", "creator": "@dpd_", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, atheisttv, Editor's Picks, Neil degrasse Tyson, Richard Dawkins", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd03b\"", "article_summary": "Topics: atheisttv, Editor's Picks, Neil degrasse Tyson, Richard Dawkins, Entertainment NewsThe Christian right has some things figured out.\nAtheistTV adheres to nasty stereotypes about atheism \u2014 smugness, gleeful disregard for others\u2019 beliefs \u2014 to a degree that\u2019s close to unwatchable.\nThe recently-launched AtheistTV, which is available over the Internet and through the Roku streaming device, frames itself as an outreach project of sorts.\nIt consists of acquired programming (for instance, from the Richard Dawkins Institute), with call-in shows and broadcasts of speeches and rallies.\nAll of these set forth the tenets of atheism \u2014 there\u2019s no \u201cAmerican Bible Challenge\u201d-style tomfoolery here."}
