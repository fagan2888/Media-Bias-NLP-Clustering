She says arts and crafts has been a part of her life since she was a young girl.\n\n\"I was inspired actually by my father who did a lot of cement work growing up. The leftover cement I would make things out of and he called me mud-hen, hence the name,\" Cameron said.\n\nCameron says her sculptures have been a popular sale. She's just glad people admire her work just as much as she enjoys making it.\n\nThe vendors may be gone but the benefits of the event continue here in KELOLAND.
