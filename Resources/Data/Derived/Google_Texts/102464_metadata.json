But with that comes a major overhaul in how physicians code. While ICD-9 has about 14,000 codes, there will be nearly 70,000 diagnostic codes in ICD-10.\n\nLast year, lawmakers tacked an ICD-10 delay onto legislation, pushing it back for a third time. But when when lawmakers reformed the sustainable growth rate in April they did not mention ICD-10, a move that many thought was an all-clear for the changeover.\n\n[Also: Another ICD-10 bill calls for 2-year grace period]\n\nStill, a few lawmakers have pitched longshot bills since April to delay ICD-10 or soften the blow for physicians. Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas, has pitched another delay while a bill by Rep. Diane Black, R-Tennessee, would allow dual coding of ICD-9 and ICD-10 for a period.\n\nNeither of those bills has made it out of committee.\n\nThis is a breaking story and will be updated shortly.\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/cms-says-it-wont-deny-icd-10-claims-year-scores-american-medical-association-backing", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/firefeat_2_0.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on Monday said it will not deny claims under the Part B physician fee schedule based on ICD-10 coding errors, a decision supported by bitter ICD-10 opponent the American Medical Association.", "title": "CMS says it won't deny ICD-10 claims for a year, scores American Medical Association backing"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/firefeat_2_0.jpg"}, "description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on Monday said it will not deny claims under the Part B physician fee schedule based on ICD-10 coding errors, a decision supported by bitter ICD-10 opponent the American Medical Association.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "CMS says it won't deny ICD-10 claims for a year, scores American Medical Association backing"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services on Monday said it will not deny claims under the Part B physician fee schedule based on ICD-10 coding errors, a decision supported by bitter ICD-10 opponent the American Medical Association.&#13; Instead, if a wrong code is used Medicare review contractors will not deny their claim as long as a valid code from the right family is used, CMS said.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c6f\"", "article_summary": "Illustration of an ICD-10 code (HIMSS)The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on Monday said it will not deny claims under the Part B physician fee schedule based on ICD-10 coding errors, a decision supported by bitter ICD-10 opponent the American Medical Association.\n[Also: Another ICD-10 bill calls for 2-year grace period]Still, a few lawmakers have pitched longshot bills since April to delay ICD-10 or soften the blow for physicians.\nLast year, lawmakers tacked an ICD-10 delay onto legislation, pushing it back for a third time.\nCMS also said it would hire an ICD-10 ombudsman to manage questions about claims.\nThe AMA has long blasted the switch in coding over concerns that it would place too many burdens on physicians."}
