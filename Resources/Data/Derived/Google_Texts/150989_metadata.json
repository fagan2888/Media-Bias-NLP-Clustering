This and other developments should leave health systems considering investing in proton therapy treading cautiously \u2013 but not ruling it out altogether.\n\nOn the advice of an outside review committee, Indiana University Health is closing its proton therapy center early next year, once the current roster of patients have completed treatment.\n\nIU Health\u2019s proton therapy center was the nation\u2019s third proton treatment facility and the Midwest\u2019s first when it opened in 2004. It offered cancer patients the potential of more selective radiation treatment with fewer side effects, but 10 years later, its clinical benefits remain unclear, its technology is slightly outdated and its finances seem unsustainable.\n\nThe proton therapy center operated on a deficit for most of its existence (consuming $3.5 million in 2013) and the 20-hospital system has little choice but to cut its losses, said Jay Hess, MD, vice president for university clinical affairs and dean of the IU School of Medicine.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he said in a media release, \u201crapidly advancing technology and changes in the dynamics of cancer treatment have left us with a dwindling patient base and a facility that is many times more expensive to operate than most of our competitors in this field.\u201d\n\nSince IU Health and other pioneers opened their facilities 10 years ago, the number of proton treatment centers has proliferated, with 13 now in operation across the country and 10 under construction, according to the National Association for Proton Therapy.\n\nBut the debate over proton treatment\u2019s effectiveness compared to traditional radiation therapies has grown only more murky, and more insurers, like Aetna and Blue Shield of California, have stopped covering it for malignancies such as prostate cancer, which has been a large source of revenue for proton therapy and cancer treatment centers in general.\n\nBut absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and oncology researchers and advocates still hold hope for proton therapy across cancer types, particularly for pediatric cancers and cancers of the eye, brain, head and neck, and some providers and payers think this form of therapy is worthwhile for patient outcomes and business.\n\nTwo such entities are Independence Blue Cross and Penn Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania Health System, both in Philadelphia.\n\nWhen Penn Medicine opened its proton center in 2010, it created a reference pricing agreement with Independence Blue Cross (IBC). The health system is reimbursed at the same rate for radiation therapy, regardless of whether an IBC-insured cancer patient receives proton therapy or other forms of radiation, while patient outcomes are being tracked in a registry to gauge long-term costs and benefits. New Jersey\u2019s largest insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, also covers proton treatment for members with prostate cancer who enroll in a randomized trial at Penn Medicine.\n\n\u201cReference pricing with evidence development is attractive for proton therapy,\u201d as Penn Medicine oncologists Justin Bekelman, MD, and Stephen Hahn, MD, wrote recently in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nCurrently, \u201cthe price premium of proton therapy is not only untenable in the eyes of payers and patients but also an obstacle to evidence development,\u201d they argued. \u201cYet, we can conduct the necessary research only if payers pay for proton therapy and its photon-based alternatives. Reference pricing preserves access to proton therapy and reduces financial barriers to evidence development.\u201d\n\nIf providers are interested in opening proton therapy centers \u2013 which exist in only 12 states currently \u2013 they should \u201cfund the difference between the reference price paid by insurers and the costs of proton therapy,\u201d Bekelman and Hahn argued.\n\nBut, not only are private payers limiting reimbursement for proton radiation therapy; public payers \u2013 including some very large state ones \u2013 are starting to as well.\n\nThe Washington State Health Technology Assessment Program, which determines coverage for certain high-cost health services paid by Medicaid and the state employee health plan, recently decided to include proton therapy as a \u201ccovered benefit with conditions.\u201d\n\nBased on a review of current evidence, the Washington\u2019s assessment program is limiting coverage to ocular cancers, pediatric cancers, central nervous system tumors and non-metastatic cancers with agency discretion. Excluded are some of the most common cancers.\n\nThe program\u2019s board found the evidence base \u201cinsufficient to determine net health benefit\u201d for proton treatment of breast and gastrointestinal cancers and found that proton therapy is comparable though not superior to standard treatment options for lung and prostate cancers.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/rethinking-proton-center-investment", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The Midwest's first proton beam cancer therapy center is closing its doors amid ongoing efficacy questions and financial struggles.
