Burwell said, adding the subsidies are proof the law is \u201cworking for the middle class.\u201d\n\nThe report is part of the HHS\u2019s push to make the Obamacare exchanges look more attractive to uninsured Americans before Sunday\u2019s deadline to sign up.\n\nBut it\u2019s also an implicit rebuke to congressional Republicans and other Obamacare critics who want the Supreme Court to invalidate the subsidies in 34 states that did not set up their own exchanges.\n\nChallengers in a lawsuit before the court, King v. Burwell, say the Affordable Care Act of 2010 reserved the subsidies for exchanges \u201cestablished by the state,\u201d which they interpret as exchanges set up by 16 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe administration feverishly disagrees, saying there is no evidence Congress intended to treat enrollees in some states differently than others.\n\nWithout the tax credits, many people would no longer be able to afford their coverage, throwing Obamacare and individual insurance markets into a tailspin in the affected states.\n\nMrs. Burwell has been mum about any plans to deal with a ruling that strikes down the subsidies. Instead, her agency has highlighted the benefits of taxpayer assistance under the law.\n\nCongressional Republicans, meanwhile, have complained about the price tag of doling out Obamacare subsidies to so many Americans on top of the cost of expanding Medicaid in certain states.\n\nLast week, a trio of influential GOP lawmakers released an alternative to Obamacare that would still offer subsidies to lower-income Americans seeking private health coverage.\n\nThe blueprint, which is not yet a bill, would offer tax credits to people making up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level in place of Obamacare\u2019s 100 percent-to-400 percent window.\n\nAlso, it would replace the law\u2019s Medicaid expansion with state-by-state grant funding \u2014 ostensibly letting people below the poverty level choose between the program and subsidized private coverage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare enrollees who qualify for subsidies on the federal exchange will see their monthly premiums drop by an average of 72 percent in 2015 due to the help from taxpayers, the Obama administration said Monday in a report that underscores the stakes of a health showdown before the Supreme Court this term.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Obamacare enrollees who qualify for subsidies on the federal exchange will see their monthly premiums drop by an average of 72 percent in 2015 due to the help from taxpayers, the Obama administration said Monday in a report that underscores the stakes of a health showdown before the Supreme Court this term.", "title": "Obamacare subsidies cut premiums by average of 72 percent: HHS", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/9/obamacare-subsidies-cut-premiums-average-72-pct/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/04/congress-health-overhaul-jpeg-07c53.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/04/congress-health-overhaul-jpeg-07c53.jpg", "description": "Obamacare enrollees who qualify for subsidies on the federal exchange will see their monthly premiums drop by an average of 72 percent in 2015 due to the help from taxpayers, the Obama administration", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obamacare subsidies cut premiums by average of 72 percent: HHS"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, Supreme Court, Sylvia M Burwell"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbaf6\"", "article_summary": "The average customer will get $268 in tax subsidies a month, leaving them with a $105 bill.\nTaxpayers will pick up the cost of 72 percent of the average premiums for customers who qualify for Obamacare subsidies using HealthCare.gov, the administration said Monday in a report that underscores the stakes in a looming Supreme Court case.\nCongressional Republicans, meanwhile, have complained about the price tag of doling out Obamacare subsidies to so many Americans on top of the cost of expanding Medicaid in certain states.\nLast week, a trio of influential GOP lawmakers released an alternative to Obamacare that would still offer subsidies to lower-income Americans seeking private health coverage.\nAll of those customers could lose subsidies should the Supreme Court rule that the administration broke the law by paying out to customers on the federal exchange instead of limiting the subsidies to users of state-run exchanges."}
