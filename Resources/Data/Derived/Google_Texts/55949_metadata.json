After decades of fighting the Christian right on social issues, rank-and-file liberals are quicker to reject the intrusion of religion into public life than welcoming it into the party on a national stage.\n\nBut Obama\u2019s speech also delivered a broad sense of awe and the promise of transcendence that lay at the heart of his original political vision while running for office, and that has drained out of our politics since then. In his breakout 2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention, Obama played up the communitarian ethics of Christianity (\u201cI am my brother\u2019s keeper, I am my sister\u2019s keeper\u201d) and religious Democrats (\u201cWe worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states\u201d). The title of his second memoir, The Audacity of Hope, came from a sermon given by his former pastor, Reverend Jeremiah Wright.\n\nDuring election season, Obama's spiritual side was only one part of his broader appeal and, for many Democrats, easy to overlook, particularly after the controversy surrounding Rev. Wright made it a less politically friendly topic. On Friday, however, it wasn\u2019t Candidate Obama\u2019s promise of political transcendence\u2014uniting red states and blue states, liberal America and conservative America\u2014but Reverend Obama\u2019s promise of moral absolution as Christianity sees us: as flawed humans who\u2019ve been blessed without earning it, and people who should express that gratitude through just acts. That\u2019s been the great source of strength for a black church like Emanuel AME that has sustained a community that has been subjected to such deep suffering. And Obama is trying to be the bearer of hope once again by channeling that spiritual tradition into policy action.\n\nIn his speech, he expanded his call to action to the broader forms of institutional racism that have exacerbated economic injustice and inequality\u2014the causes at the heart of Christian liberation theology, whose proponents have sought to uplift the poor across the globe. Obama drew particular attention to the ways that racial discrimination can seep into hiring practices, which has been a major focus of his administration\u2019s Equal Opportunity Employment Commission. \u201cMaybe we now realize the way a racial bias can infect us even when we don\u2019t realize it so that we\u2019re guarding against not just racial slurs but we\u2019re also guarding against the subtle impulse to call Johnny back for a job interview but not Jamal,\u201d he explained.\n\nObama finally addressed the \u201cunique mayhem that gun violence inflicts.\u201d But he didn\u2019t simply renew his call for new gun control measures, but also explained that doing so would make us more worthy in the eyes of God. \u201cThe vast majority of Americans, the majority of gun owners want to do something about this. We see that now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m convinced that by acknowledging the pain and loss of others, even as we respect the traditions, ways of life that make up this beloved country, by making the moral choice to change, we express God\u2019s grace.\u201d\n\nObama believes that we prove ourselves worthy of God\u2019s benevolence through the choices and changes that we make, and that the most urgent changes happen through the hard slog of policy reform. Obama himself bristled at the triumph of words over action. \u201cEvery time something like this happens, somebody says, \u2018We have to have a conversation about race.\u2019 We talk a lot about race. There\u2019s no shortcut. We don\u2019t need more talk,\u201d Obama said.\n\nThe president\u2019s eulogy, of course, was a continuation of that conversation about race. But it was also more than simply rhetoric: It continued the late Reverend\u2019s own work in bridging words and action through his faith, in the tradition of prophetic witness. As a state senator and a pastor, Pinckney saw little difference between the church pulpit and the bully pulpit.\n\n\u201cClem was often asked why he chose to be a pastor and a public servant,\u201d Obama said during Pinckney\u2019s eulogy. \u201cBut the person who asked probably didn\u2019t know the history of AME Church.\u201d Pinckney continued the long history of black civil rights leaders who've come out of the church, including not only Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., but also Denmark Vesey, the co-founder of Emanuel AME Church, who was executed after planning a slave revolt in 1822.\n\nAs a lawmaker, Pinckney also dealt with the gritty process of passing legislation. Weeks before his death, he gave a speech on the statehouse floor recalling the story of Thomas in the New Testament. His colleagues credited that speech for helping to galvanize support for the passage of body-camera legislation that he helped sign into law just a week before he was killed.\n\n\u201cIt would be a betrayal of everything Reverend Pinckney stood for, if we allowed ourselves to slip into a comfortable silence again, once the eulogies have been delivered once the TV cameras have moved on, to go back to business as usual,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we so often do, to avoid uncomfortable truths about the prejudices that still infect our society, to settle for symbolic gestures without following up with the hard work of more lasting change.\u201d\n\nThe oratorical power of Obama\u2019s speech led many to speculate about his potential post-presidential role in politics and policymaking. But it\u2019s also difficult to see many other political figures on the left taking his lead. Democrats generally are less likely to be religiously affiliated than their Republican counterparts, and the millenial generation even less so. As Buzzfeed\u2019s Joel Anderson explains, Pinckney himself was an outlier for embracing \u201cfaith-based, left-wing politics\u201d at a time when many black politicians are \u201cpost-partisan technocrats.\u201d That includes Obama himself: For much of his time in office, it\u2019s been Professor Obama\u2014not the Reverend President.\n\nBut inspiration has to come from somewhere, especially since the path to change necessarily runs through our decidedly non-transcendent politics. Obama\u2019s eulogy came at the end of an extraordinary week of Supreme Court decisions that ushered in sweeping political progress: Same-sex marriage is the law of the land, and Obamacare is here to stay. But those victories were only possible because of the gay rights movement\u2019s political success in changing state laws across the country, and Democrats\u2019 political success in sweeping control of Congress as well as the White House.\n\nJust a week earlier, in a very different set of remarks, Obama openly admitted that the political consensus to reform gun control simply doesn\u2019t exist right now. \u201c[T]he politics in this town foreclose a lot of those avenues right now. But it would be wrong for us not to acknowledge it,\u201d he said. The press immediately piled on to lament Obama\u2019s \u201csurrender\u201d on gun control in a moment of apparent resignation. But failing to acknowledge those political obstacles to fighting injustice is tantamount to pretending them don\u2019t exist. And we will need leaders, movements, and advocates who are able to consolidate enough political power to break through those political barriers, which continue to fuel resignation, cynicism, and political disengagement\u2014a kind of spiritual disillusionment.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of fancy forums and galas and town hall meetings, and this meeting and that meeting, where we talk, we talk, we talk. Meanwhile, our young people aren\u2019t connected,\u201d said Munir Bahar, a 34-year-old community activist, told me at a forum on poverty in Baltimore last week, frustrated by the lack of action in the wake of Freddie Gray's death.\n\nA call for social change that fails to seek the political tools to enact them will just be more talk, no matter how divinely inspired the rhetoric. And it means convincing more Americans that sweeping change isn\u2019t always damned to fail.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The religious underpinnings of the President's call to political action", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "The religious underpinnings of the President's call to political action.", "title": "Reverend Obama's Historic Sermon", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/6ccbef564339937f5f61c441bb2cccd2627c337f.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/122189/reverend-obamas-historic-sermon", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The religious underpinnings of the President's call to political action.", "title": "Reverend Obama's Historic Sermon", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/6ccbef564339937f5f61c441bb2cccd2627c337f.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "creator": "@SuzyKhimm", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/6ccbef564339937f5f61c441bb2cccd2627c337f.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Reverend Obama's Historic Sermon\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/122189/reverend-obamas-historic-sermon\",\"section\":\"Charleston\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-06-29T10:00:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":122189,\"author\":\"Suzy Khimm\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Charleston\",\"Politics\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Charleston", "published_time": "2015-06-29"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde2d\"", "article_summary": "The title of his second memoir, The Audacity of Hope, came from a sermon given by his former pastor, Reverend Jeremiah Wright.\n\u201cWe have a lot of fancy forums and galas and town hall meetings, and this meeting and that meeting, where we talk, we talk, we talk.\nWe don\u2019t need more talk,\u201d Obama said.\nThe press immediately piled on to lament Obama\u2019s \u201csurrender\u201d on gun control in a moment of apparent resignation.\nOn Friday, however, it wasn\u2019t Candidate Obama\u2019s promise of political transcendence\u2014uniting red states and blue states, liberal America and conservative America\u2014but Reverend Obama\u2019s promise of moral absolution as Christianity sees us: as flawed humans who\u2019ve been blessed without earning it, and people who should express that gratitude through just acts."}
