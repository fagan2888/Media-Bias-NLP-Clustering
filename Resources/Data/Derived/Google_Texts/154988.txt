Donald Trump won a big victory in his home state of New York on Tuesday, and he walked up to give his victory speech to Frank Sinatra's version of "New York, New York," a staple of Yankees games and karaoke bars. Trump began by thanking his family and New York's voters, "the people that know me the best." He will win more delegates in New York than people projected "even in their wildest imagination," Trump said, and chided the press for reports of trouble in his campaign, saying he leads "a team of unity," that "keeps evolving."

In his speech, Trump focused on jobs and the economy, "his wheelhouse," saying he will keep U.S. companies from moving to Mexico and other countries. He also promised to build up the military, repeal ObamaCare, and scrap Common Core educational guidelines.
