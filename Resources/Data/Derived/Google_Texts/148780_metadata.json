As we noted, this is the first case of its kind, in which plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers are seeking injunctions, restitution and other damages for a putative class of consumers based on claims of unfair business practices stemming from a company\u2019s alleged failure to ensure that its business practices match up with its public disclosure. But the Costco case certainly won\u2019t be the last one. Indeed, just this week, a similar consumer class action was filed against Nestle, alleging that its pet food products also included seafood farmed using slave labor.\n\nIn our post last week, we discussed how the new laws that require companies to make disclosures about their supply chain operations mean that it is important not only to make a proper disclosure, but also to enact a robust compliance program.\n\nThis week, we\u2019d like to summarize some of the real world considerations bearing on what will likely drive further litigation against companies for alleged failure to operate consistent with their public statements. Hopefully, that may help prevent such class actions or prepare for defeating them.\n\nDefending consumer and shareholder class actions is difficult and fraught with risk. Often, these suits are \u201cone-party litigation,\u201d because if the plaintiffs\u2019 law firms have chosen a sufficiently uncontroversial person to serve as the nominal plaintiff, the defendants are entirely the focus of the proceedings. The nominal plaintiffs\u2019 conduct is often irrelevant; usually, all someone has to do to be a plaintiff is buy some of the product (for consumer class actions) or buy some stock (for shareholder class actions). This is often done in coordination with the real backers of the lawsuit.\n\nMoreover, in consumer and shareholder class actions stemming from corporate social responsibility issues, negative publicity is often drummed up to drive and compound the litigation challenges that a company faces. The new Costco case illustrates the point.\n\nThe complaint in the new Costco case spends about 40 of its 50 pages alleging that slave labor exists in certain fishing areas of Southeast Asia. About half of those pages are replete with photographs and quotations from multinational media and NGO documentaries and commentaries \u2013 about slavery, not about Costco, to elicit outrage. The complaint includes photographs of packaged shrimp on Costco shelves in California, taken on the last day before the complaint was filed \u2013 to connect the company with the foreign societal problem and to create a sense of urgency locally.\n\nAnd then, in what will be both a theme and an organizing principle in this new sort of litigation, the complaint boldly alleges a short sentence 42 pages into the depiction of a centuries\u2019 old problem that multiple governments and NGOs are combating \u2013 that \u201cCostco could remedy this situation by enforcing its supplier standards, which prohibit slave labor and human trafficking.\u201d\n\nThe legal bases for this type of litigation are old ones \u2013 longstanding state unfair business practices laws and consumer protection laws. In California, for decades, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel have been known for treating those laws as particularly flexible anytime a new opportunity for them can be thought up.\n\nWhat is new here is the combined use of those old laws and the new California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. California\u2019s longstanding unfair business practices act allows a claim to be brought against anyone who engages in \u201cunlawful\u201d business practices. By seeking to stand on the shoulders of the new California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and the reports of media and NGOs, the complaint in the new Costco case alleges that the company\u2019s practices \u201care unlawful in that their conduct in sourcing and selling farmed prawns actively contributes to the use of slave labor in violation of bans,\u201d ranging from the state\u2019s Penal Code to U.S. federal law to the UN Declaration of Human Rights. And only a little more specifically, the complaint alleges that \u201cCostco\u2019s conduct in representing that it enforces policies against the use of slave labor in the farming of the prawns it sells is a violation of\u201d the new California Transparency in Supply Chains Act \u2014 and therefore in turn is alleged to give rise to a claim under the state unfair business practices law.\n\nClass action litigation is sometimes brought as \u201cimpact litigation.\u201d This is litigation meant to not only obtain a large dollar award for consumers and a large attorneys\u2019 fee award for the law firms that brought the case, which are certainly huge motivating factors (indeed business models for some plaintiffs\u2019 law firms), but are also touted as a way to address a broader societal problem.\n\nEach of those motivating factors \u2013 the lure of money for consumers, the lure of money for plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees, and the lure of impacting a broader societal problem \u2013 drives cases like this. More such cases seem likely, as others seek to stand on the shoulders of media and NGO reports with new lawsuits designed to pressure U.S. businesses in ways to address societal problems that distant governments have not fully addressed; some problems for centuries.\n\nTo prevent being targeted in such cases, and/or in preparation for defeating one if brought, it is important for companies to be able to demonstrate reasonable and good faith control and monitoring of their supply chains. Perfect supply chain compliance with corporate social responsibility policies and goals may not be able to be proven (and may not be achievable). But being able to show that a company implemented robust procedures, engaged in diligent efforts to follow and enforce those procedures, and monitored regularly, will be important to prevent being targeted with this new class action litigation \u2013 or if targeted, then in mounting a successful defense. Hiring the right supply chain/ industry experts, to show what the best practices in industry are, will likely also be pivotal.\n\nMore class actions like the new Costco and Nestle cases seem likely, in California and elsewhere. Avoiding them if possible, and defending them when brought, will be a priority.", "article_metadata": {"description": "consumer class action was filed against Nestle, alleging that its pet food products also included seafood farmed using slave labor", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "Last week, we wrote about the newly-filed consumer class action against Costco in federal court in San Francisco, based on Costco&amp;rsquo;s disclosure under the California Transparency in Supply Chains", "title": "Defending Against New-Style Supply Chain Litigation (Or, There Are Teeth in the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act \u2013 Don\u2019t Get Bitten) (Or, More Cases Filed)", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/defending-against-new-style-supply-chain-litigation-or-there-are-teeth-california", "image": "http://www.globalsupplychainlawblog.com/files/2015/08/School-2-580x385.jpg", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Consumer Protection, Nation, Companies, Nestle, Costco, California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, Slave Labor, Manufacturing,", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, Consumer Protection, Nation, Companies, Nestle, Costco, California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, Slave Labor, Manufacturing,"}, "article_summary": "California\u2019s longstanding unfair business practices act allows a claim to be brought against anyone who engages in \u201cunlawful\u201d business practices.\nIndeed, just this week, a similar consumer class action was filed against Nestle, alleging that its pet food products also included seafood farmed using slave labor.\nWhat is new here is the combined use of those old laws and the new California Transparency in Supply Chains Act.\nFriday, August 28, 2015Last week, we wrote about the newly-filed consumer class action against Costco in federal court in San Francisco, based on Costco\u2019s disclosure under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act.\nHiring the right supply chain/ industry experts, to show what the best practices in industry are, will likely also be pivotal."}
