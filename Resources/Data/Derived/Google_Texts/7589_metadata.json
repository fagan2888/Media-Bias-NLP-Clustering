Joe Pitts (R-Pa.) recently introduced H.R. 2461 to crack down on race-day doping of race horses.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe measure's introduction coincides with the Triple Crown win by American Pharoah.\n\nAsked whether American Pharoah\u2019s accomplishment is legit, the Energy and Commerce Health subcommittee chairman told The Hill's Molly K. Hooper, \"I don't know, I can\u2019t say why horses win and lose, but I know that most horses are on meds on race day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a horse is using performance-enhancing drug or medicine to mask the pain, often they will run injured. When a horse injures or breaks a leg, that\u2019s a death sentence.\"\n\nPitts has a special connection to injured horses. His district contains the New Bolton Center animal hospital, where beloved Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro was a patient for nearly a year after a tragic leg injury during the Preakness in 2006.\n\nBarbaro's owners, Roy and Gretchen Jackson, are constituents of Pitts. They support his effort, the congressman says, noting that in the American horse race world, \u201cIt\u2019s an uneven playing field, it\u2019s not fair. It switches the odds in favor of people who are cheating.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday there are some 27 drugs on a permitted list that they can use on race day.\"\n\nWatch Pitts describe the measure and his reflections on Barbaro in the video above.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "A high-ranking GOP lawmaker wants the sport of horse racing to clean up its act.", "description": "A high-ranking GOP lawmaker wants the sport of horse racing to clean up its act.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "The Hill staff", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "A high-ranking GOP lawmaker wants the sport of horse racing to clean up its act.", "title": "GOP rep calls for crackdown on race-horse doping", "url": "http://thehill.com/video/in-the-news/244936-gop-rep-calls-for-crackdown-on-race-horse-doping", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/horses04232015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-14T08:53:43-04:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-06-14T08:53-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/video/in-the-news/244936-gop-rep-calls-for-crackdown-on-race-horse-doping", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-14T08:53-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Wes Jones", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-14T08:53:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-14T08:53:43-04:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/video/in-the-news/244936-gop-rep-calls-for-crackdown-on-race-horse-doping", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "A high-ranking GOP lawmaker wants the sport of horse racing to clean up its act.", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP rep calls for crackdown on race-horse doping"}, "dcterms.title": "GOP rep calls for crackdown on race-horse doping"}, "article_summary": "They support his effort, the congressman says, noting that in the American horse race world, \u201cIt\u2019s an uneven playing field, it\u2019s not fair.\n2461 to crack down on race-day doping of race horses.\nPitts has a special connection to injured horses.\nA high-ranking GOP lawmaker wants the sport of horse racing to clean up its act.\nADVERTISEMENTThe measure's introduction coincides with the Triple Crown win by American Pharoah."}
