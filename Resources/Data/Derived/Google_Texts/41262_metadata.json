And it\u2019s happening to many other NYC moms.\n\nWhen Choudhury\u2019s doctor told her he\u2019d meet her at Mount Sinai-Roosevelt Hospital, her contractions were 2 1/2 minutes apart. She arrived to find a packed waiting room, no beds available, no seats available, and four or five other women in labor, standing.\n\nHer doctor was nowhere to be found. So she waited:\n\nFor two hours, as my contractions got stronger and stronger, I stood and rocked back and forth in the hallway of a busy labor and delivery wing\u2026.Not once did a nurse or resident stop to ask me my name, how far along I was, how I was doing or if I needed anything at all. Not once in the two hours I stood in pain just a few feet from the nurses station.\n\nShe was about to give birth by the time she was brought into triage:\n\nI was finally checked and told I was 7 to 8 cm dilated! Great news, but also scary knowing I could have delivered in the hallway if we were left on our own for much longer. Our daughter\u2019s heart rate began to drop significantly, indicating some kind of distress. After this happened a total of three times through the night and into the early morning, we did realize we were in for an unplanned emergency c-section.\n\nFortunately, her daughter Laila was born healthy and everyone is doing fine today. But Choudhury still has questions:\n\nHow long was she in distress? Could something have happened to her in those two hours I was forced to stand and labor alone? These are just some of the questions I ask myself over and over again.\n\nWhen she shared her story on Facebook she received \u201cdozens of messages\u201d from NYC women who have been in similar circumstances in various city hospitals.\n\nOne woman, Annie Coppins, also waited for hours in a hospital hallway, asking for an anesthesiologist. Only after she and her husband, Buzzfeed\u2019s McKay Coppins, took to Twitter to ask for help did it finally arrive.\n\nAnother, Laurie Kyle, says the medical staff mocked her natural birth choices \u2013 while she was giving birth:\n\n\u201cI just did not anticipate being insulted in the throes of my pain for no reason by someone saying do you mind if we use these sterile instruments? Are they not natural enough for you. The resident who stitched me up made a comment about how this is what she gets when she doesn\u2019t want an episiotomy,\u201d\n\nMichele Giordono, Executive Director of Choices in Childbirth, said they hear from women \u201call the time\u201d about bad childbirth experiences in NYC:\n\nThe problem, according to [Giordono], is evident at nearly every single city hospital. And the issue\u2026does not discriminate between public or private hospitals.\n\nTwo hospitals named in Choudhury\u2019s stories have issued statements, saying they are aware of the complaints and always striving to improve.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "\"We should not head in to take part in one of life\u2019s most empowering and beautiful moments and come out feeling stripped and traumatized.\"", "published_at": "2015-05-02T11:45:57+00:00", "tags": "Lifestyle", "og": {"site_name": "Independent Journal Review", "description": "\"We should not head in to take part in one of life\u2019s most empowering and beautiful moments and come out feeling stripped and traumatized.\"", "title": "NYC Reporter Shares Horrific Birth Experience in Overcrowded Hospital, And Finds out She\u2019s Not Alone", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 686, "identifier": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/coppins.jpg", "height": 430}, "updated_time": "2015-05-02T13:13:49-04:00", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/05/308774-nyc-reporter-shares-horrific-birth-experience-overcrowded-hospital-finds-shes-not-alone/", "type": "article"}, "is_article": 1, "twitter": {"description": "\"We should not head in to take part in one of life\u2019s most empowering and beautiful moments and come out feeling stripped and traumatized.\"", "creator": "@somethingabtjen", "image": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/coppins.jpg", "title": "NYC Reporter Shares Horrific Birth Experience in Overcrowded Hospital, And Finds out She\u2019s Not Alone", "site": "@injo", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jennifer Van Laar", "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-05-02T11:45:57-04:00", "wp-categories": "687 14087 2567", "p": {"domain_verify": "770b5b250556c52fa42a70dc373c541b"}, "fb": {"admins": 1116123001, "app_id": 251714254848821}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=878142436", "url": "http://www.ijreview.com/2015/05/308774-nyc-reporter-shares-horrific-birth-experience-overcrowded-hospital-finds-shes-not-alone/", "wp-category-slugs": "culture, health, lifestyle", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/injoreview/", "section": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-05-02T11:45:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-02T13:13:49-04:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/somethingabtjen"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "image": "http://www.ijreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/coppins.jpg", "post_id": 308774, "is_https": 0}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc86a\"", "article_summary": "One woman, Annie Coppins, also waited for hours in a hospital hallway, asking for an anesthesiologist.\nWhen Choudhury\u2019s doctor told her he\u2019d meet her at Mount Sinai-Roosevelt Hospital, her contractions were 2 1/2 minutes apart.\nShe arrived to find a packed waiting room, no beds available, no seats available, and four or five other women in labor, standing.\nCould something have happened to her in those two hours I was forced to stand and labor alone?\nNot once in the two hours I stood in pain just a few feet from the nurses station."}
