Barack Obama has given his share of interviews, but perhaps few as bizarre as this. The president appeared on Zach Galifianakis' web show, Between Two Ferns, to plug the Affordable Care Act and Healthcare.gov.

The show is even more scripted than most of the president's TV interviews and twice as awkward.

But what do you think? Was the bit presidential? Or perhaps more important, was it funny?
