After all, I\u2019ve probably flown more than a million miles on Southwest dating back to the days when their tickets were a cash register receipt and you could fly from Tulsa to Dallas for $19 on a Friday night. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m not in their Rapid Rewards database. They know exactly who I am and have voluminous records on my flying habits. Whatever some of their executives may think of me, they know I\u2019m not a terrorist.\n\nSo, you would think that when I schedule a six segment week\u2014about \u00be of a lap of America\u2014they would use their good sense and allow me to go through the metal detector with my shoes and belt on and save us all a bit of time and money.\n\nBut noooooooo.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nOf the six flights I took that week, only the last two, returning back to Reno from Raleigh-Durham, were TSA Pre checked.\n\nAnd you wonder why Donald Trump is leading the GOP field of candidates.\n\nHere\u2019s a question for both the TSA and Southwest.\n\nHow could I be a potential threat that needs full screening for the first four segments and then, all of a sudden not a threat for five and six? Did it really take four flight segments in two days for some pinhead at Southwest to figure out who I was? Not likely.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThe TSA has nearly ruined business travel. The whole object of 9-11 was so a bunch of Islamic jerks could get us to fear something. As it turns out, what most of us fear is the complete and utter waste of time that dealing with the TSA has become. And the huge amount of lost productivity the TSA has caused.\n\nWhat you see at the airport is largely eye candy.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t fly a lot probably think there\u2019s some scientific method to TSA airport screening which keeps us all safe.\n\nThe truth is that TSA airport screening is to security what Obamacare is to healthcare.\n\nIt\u2019s an insult to the collective intelligence of Americans who aren\u2019t going to hijack an airliner or hurt anyone but just want to be left alone.\n\nAnd the only way it stops is if the airline executives like Kelly grow a pair and tell the government where to shove it on behalf of their long suffering customers.\n\nIf the airlines demanded a stop to the nonsense, they\u2019d get it because they know their customers would be behind them all the way.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be nice if someone in Dallas was paying attention?\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The truth is that TSA airport screening is to security what Obamacare is to healthcare.", "author": "Fred Weinberg", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "The truth is that TSA airport screening is to security what Obamacare is to healthcare.", "title": "Southwest CEO Gary Kelly Should Grow A Pair", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3000, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ThinkstockPhotos-104485634.jpg", "height": 2121}, "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/southwest-ceo-gary-kelly-should-grow-a-pair/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The truth is that TSA airport screening is to security what Obamacare is to healthcare.", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ThinkstockPhotos-104485634.jpg", "title": "Southwest CEO Gary Kelly Should Grow A Pair", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-11-06T13:02:29-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "Transportation Security Administration TSA", "published_time": "2015-11-06T13:02:29-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "southwest airlines, gary kelly, tsa pre check, , terrorism, transportation security administration tsa, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "People who don\u2019t fly a lot probably think there\u2019s some scientific method to TSA airport screening which keeps us all safe.\nThe truth is that TSA airport screening is to security what Obamacare is to healthcare.\nDid it really take four flight segments in two days for some pinhead at Southwest to figure out who I was?\nAnd the only way it stops is if the airline executives like Kelly grow a pair and tell the government where to shove it on behalf of their long suffering customers.\nHere\u2019s a question for both the TSA and Southwest."}
