Below is a weekly post which contains some of the most important quotes about the economy and industry trends from those transcripts as well as other forums.\n\nLast week was a slow one for earnings calls, but Warren Buffett did do an interview with CNBC that featured classic Buffett wisdom. This week we also included excerpts from Dan Loeb\u2019s Third Point Reinsurance conference call. Loeb was relatively positive on the economy, but not very excited about opportunities for activist investing.\n\nClick here to receive these posts weekly via email.\n\nThe Macro Outlook\n\nWarren Buffett said despite the occasional soft spot, the economy has continued to improve.\n\n\u201cBusiness, I would say, is a little softer in many places, than people . . . than I anticipated say four or five months ago . . . But, you know . . . overall the economy\u2019s just kept moving up around 2%.\u201d \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) chairman and CEO Warren Buffett (Conglomerate)\n\nDan Loeb sees a lot of people on alert, but not recession.\n\n\u201cSo as to your question about recession, look, along with the other things like China oil prices, Fed policy, etc., I mean, that\u2019s on the top of people\u2019s list as far as concerns go. We are looking at economic data. . . . What we do see is weakness in companies with cyclical exposure. . . . But as far as industrial companies, consumer companies, certainly health care companies, we are not seeing any sign of a recession. We see a lot of people that are on alert, but there haven\u2019t really been any signs of recession from either the economic data, the surveys, or individual conversations with companies.\u201d \u2014 Third Point Reinsurance (TPRE) chief executive Dan Loeb (Reinsurance)\n\nCompanies generally had positive things to say about the economy. Dollar Tree is positive with how its current quarter is trending.\n\n\u201cAs far as current trends . . . I\u2019m pleased with where we are. . . . My expectation is that . . . we\u2019re on track for a good first quarter.\u201d \u2014 Dollar Tree (DLTR) CEO Bob Sasser (Discount Stores)\n\nConstruction is as robust as its ever been in New York, Florida, and California.\n\n\u201cBuilding markets are stronger than ever in California, New York and Florida.\u201d \u2014 Tutor Perini (TPC) chairman and CEO Ronald Tutor (Engineering and Construction)\n\nMedtronic didn\u2019t see the broader economic situation impacting its performance.\n\n\u201cAnniversarying of the Affordable Care Act and that probably had a little bit of an impact. The overall procedure volumes based on the economy, I think, were more or less steady. . . . There were no economy-related issues.\u201d \u2014 Medtronic (MDT) chairman and CEO Omar Ishrak (Medical Device)\n\nDel Frisco\u2019s restaurants said that its high-end patrons are not tightening their belts.\n\n\u201cContrary to popular belief, the upscale guest is spending more money. We see that at the Del Frisco\u2019s brand. We see [that] at the Sullivan\u2019s brand.\u201d \u2014 Del Frisco (DFRG) CEO Mark Mednansky (Restaurants)\n\nSun Hydraulics said that its distributors have reduced inventories as much as possible.\n\n\u201cWe also follow our distributor inventory, and we saw that inventory started going south in late \u201914, continuing into \u201915. And it appears that that distributor inventory, they\u2019ve taken it down to as far as they can take it down. So when they get an order from a customer, they now have to place orders on us.\u201d \u2014 Sun Hydraulics (SNHY) president and CEO Allen Carlson (Industrial Components)\n\nAt some point, you would expect to see companies spend more on expansion.\n\n\u201cI think another thing that\u2019s going to happen, I can\u2019t predict when, and that is consumer spending will eventually turn into capital spending in projects. That hasn\u2019t happen yet, but I think the way out of this slowdown \u2014 I won\u2019t call it a recession, but the slowdown \u2014 will be based upon consumer spending driving things into the capital markets.\u201d \u2014 Sun Hydraulics (SNHY) president and CEO Allen Carlson (Industrial Components)\n\nBut then again, if Donald Trump gets elected . . .\n\n\u201cIf Donald Trump\u2019s plans were ever implemented, the country would sink into a prolonged recession. . . . His proposed 35% tariff-like penalties would instigate a trade war that would raise prices for consumers, kill export jobs, and lead entrepreneurs and businesses of all stripes to flee America. His tax plan, in combination with his refusal to reform entitlements and to honestly address spending would balloon the deficit and the national debt. So even as Donald Trump has offered very few specific economic plans, what little he has said is enough to know that he would be very bad for American workers and for American families.\u201d \u2014 Mitt Romney (Son of former American Motors President, George Romney)\n\nInternational\n\nGovernment policies are already leading to super-charged real estate markets in China.\n\n\u201cFavorable government policies in China\u2019s real estate sector, including easy monetary policies, relaxed home purchase and lower down-payments, have supported the markets we serve. . . . The China real estate market, it\u2019s actually getting better. It\u2019s getting actually crazy in recent weeks. . . . The real estate market in Shanghai is getting overheated.\u201d \u2014 Xinyuan Real Estate (XIN) CFO George Liu (Chinese Real Estate Developer)\n\nBaidu is a carbon copy of Google, including the moon shot projects.\n\n\u201cWe see a very bright future for autonomous driving, especially here in China where we face severe pollution, frequent traffic jams, and high mortality rates from traffic accidents. . . . These days, the search algorithm itself is pretty much machine learning.\u201d \u2014 Baidu (BIDU) co-founder, chairman, and CEO Robin Li (Search Engine)\n\nBaidu is the type of company that benefits as the Chinese government promotes a \u201cservice based economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven as China\u2019s overall growth slows, service and domestic consumption are growing faster. . . . Baidu largely services these growing sectors, with our top revenue verticals by broad classification including retail e-commerce, local services, health care, financial services, and education. We are confident in our outlook for Baidu and China\u2019s growing sectors. Baidu plays a vital role as the platform to connect users and merchants in these verticals.\u201d \u2014 Baidu (BIDU) co-founder, chairman, and CEO Robin Li (Search Engine)\n\nFinancials\n\nVolatility in public credit markets usually precedes defaults in private credit markets.\n\n\u201cThe fourth quarter was marked by escalating volatility in the public credit markets, a scene that continued into early 2016. As has been observed many times in the past, private credit markets tend to lag public credit markets. We expect that this time it is no different.\u201d \u2014 Goldman Sachs BDC (GSBD) COO Jonathan Yoder (BDC)\n\nWe\u2019re in an interest rate environment that the world has never seen.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened with interest rates is really extraordinary. I mean, you can go back and read everything Keynes wrote and everything Adam Smith wrote or Ricardo wrote . . . or you name it, and Paul Samuelson . . . you won\u2019t see a word . . . about sustained negative interest rates. I mean, [it\u2019s] really something the world hasn\u2019t seen.\u201d \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) chairman and CEO Warren Buffett (Conglomerate)\n\nInterest rates have a huge gravitational pull on valuations.\n\n\u201cIt does have the effect of making all assets more valuable. I mean, interest rates are like gravity in valuations. I mean, if interest rates are nothing, you know, values can be almost infinite.\u201d \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) chairman and CEO Warren Buffett (Conglomerate)\n\nNegative rates absolutely impact people\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cNegative rates affect everybody\u2019s behavior. I mean, hell, I know that I paid more for precision cast parts because interest rates are so low than I would\u2019ve paid if interest rates were 6% or 8%. I mean . . . it absolutely has an effect on my behavior. . . . I mean, it is a huge stimulus.\u201d \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) chairman and CEO Warren Buffett (Conglomerate)\n\nNo one can predict the future.\n\n\u201cIn economics the most important thing to remember . . . after anything that happens, if somebody tells you, \u2018This is going to happen,\u2019 you have to say, \u2018And then what?\u2019 . . . It\u2019s like in physics or anything else. There\u2019s always an \u2018And then what?\u2019 So the question I always ask myself, \u2018And then what?\u2019 And in terms of the, say, no interest rates, when I say \u201cAnd then what?\u201d I don\u2019t know the answer. . . . Nobody\u2019s seen this movie before. And you can go back and read all the great economists and nobody\u2019s written about a long period of negative interest rates.\u201d \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) chairman and CEO Warren Buffett (Conglomerate)\n\nDan Loeb doesn\u2019t see as many activist opportunities because companies have focused on rationalizing their capital structure.\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s happening actually is a lot of companies have undertaken the sorts of operational improvements and more rational capital structure moves, that is making it . . . more difficult for activists, because you don\u2019t have as many blatantly underperforming companies, because boards are holding the management teams more accountable.\u201d \u2014 Third Point Reinsurance (TPRE) chief executive Dan Loeb (Reinsurance)\n\nHe\u2019s more focused on under-valued opportunities.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re not seeing \u2014 that that\u2019s not really what we\u2019re focusing on. We\u2019re really focusing on securities that are under-valued where we can make investments in the constructive and not have to take any kind of confrontational role with management teams.\u201d \u2014 Third Point Reinsurance (TPRE) chief executive Dan Loeb (Reinsurance)\n\nThere are 29 million small businesses in the United States and one million use QuickBooks Online.\n\n\u201cIn terms of opportunity ahead in total addressable market, there\u2019s about 29 million small businesses in the United States . . . and we currently have one million that are using QuickBooks Online.\u201d \u2014 Intuit (INTU) chairman and CEO Brad Smith (Accounting Software)\n\nConsumer\n\nPoor results from traditional retailers continue to create openings for off-price retailers.\n\n\u201cAs long as traditional retailers continue to perform the way they are performing, you would think that there would be more opportunities there.\u201d \u2014 Ross Stores (ROST) CEO Barbara Rentler (Off-Price Retail)\n\nThe natural foods channel has fallen into a bit of a lull.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a little bit of a lull, as you know, within our natural channel. But I feel fairly optimistic that we will also come out of that. It may take a couple years, but we will come out of that, too.\u201d \u2014 United Natural Foods (UNFI) president and CEO Steven Spinner (Foods Distributor)\n\nTelevision now only reaches 85% of US adults.\n\n\u201cAccording to Nielsen\u2019s Q3 comparable metrics report, TVs weekly reach continues to decline, now reaching only 85% of US adults 18-plus, and it\u2019s particularly losing ground with the key millennial audience. By contrast, radio continues to reach 93% of all US adults 18-plus.\u201d \u2014 Clear Channel (CCO) president, COO, and CFO Richard Bressler (Radio and Billboards)\n\nThe price environment for online retailers is extremely competitive.\n\n\u201cI think you are very well aware that the most aggressive pricing environment in retail exists online, because of all the dynamic price scraping that exists and the numerous times specifically pure-play e-commerce sites can change prices throughout the day.\u201d \u2014 JC Penney (JCP) president and CEO Marvin Ellison (Retail)\n\nTechnology\n\nWorkday says that legacy incumbents are suffering for not fully adopting the cloud.\n\n\u201cI think when both companies, when SAP and Oracle moved in to the cloud, they were given a bit of a hall pass. They marketed the right terms, they used the same buzzword. But at the end of the day, we all get measured about getting customers successful and in production and they failed. They have some proof points here and there, but in the large part, neither really embraced a true cloud model and I think they are paying the price for that.\u201d \u2014 Workday (WDAY) co-founder and CEO Aneel Bhusri (SaaS)\n\nIndustrials\n\nThe dry bulk shipping industry is facing perhaps its most difficult year ever.\n\n\u201cWe expect 2016 to be one of the most challenging years in dry bulk history.\u201d \u2014 Star Bulk Carriers (SBLK) director and CEO Petros Pappas (Dry Bulk Shipping)\n\nHopefully earnings are as low as they can go, but we\u2019re not near the end of the dry bulk recession yet.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go much further down on the earnings. . . . But we\u2019re not near yet at the end of recession.\u201d \u2014 Diana Shipping (DSX) director, chairman, and CEO Simeon Palios (Dry Bulk)\n\nMaterials, Energy\n\nWarren Buffett explained why lower oil prices have not immediately boosted the economy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that it is good for the country . . . lower oil prices. But what happens is that the benefit to the consumer, it feeds in. Next time you go . . . to the filling station, the gas station, you know, you save 15 or 20 bucks. It feeds in very slowly. But the capital values disappear immediately. So if you\u2019re sitting with an oil industry in this country that\u2019s producing 10 million barrels a day or something of the sort . . . at $100 \u2014 10 million barrels a day is a billion dollars of revenue. $365 billion a year. Capital values may be $2 trillion based on that. Now, all of a sudden, you take it down to where you\u2019re not making any money, and the $2 trillion of capital values disappears very quickly. The bank loans against it get sour very quickly. They quit buying from the service companies very quickly. So the negative effects to this huge capital value happen very quickly, whereas it\u2019s easing to the consumer very slowly. So even though it\u2019s good for the country net, when you\u2019re an importing economy, it can be very bad in the immediate effects it has.\u201d \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) chairman and CEO Warren Buffett (Conglomerate)\n\nLower gas prices are definitely good for auto parts retailers though.\n\n\u201cClearly the economic cycle that we\u2019re [in], with lower gas prices which are leading to really, really high miles driven, is very favorable for us.\u201d \u2014 Autozone (AZO) chairman, president and CEO Bill Rhodes, III (Auto Parts Retail)\n\nEOG says that it still has opportunities to improve productivity that could drive returns back to triple digits, though this is probably not a positive data point for oil prices.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to realize that this is much more than a small incremental shift in our drilling program. It\u2019s a major step change in terms of per-well productivity. For the average 2016 well, we estimate a 50% increase in the first 120 days of production per foot of treated lateral versus wells we completed in 2015. Our shift to premium drilling allows EOG to quickly return to triple-digit, and I\u2019ll say this again, to quickly return to triple-digit capital rates of return as oil prices improve to modest levels.\u201d \u2014 EOG Resources (EOG) chairman and CEO William Thomas (Oil Exploration and Production)\n\nNo one wants to be fooled by a false bottom again like last year.\n\n\u201cWhen the oil prices begin to recover, we\u2019re going to be disciplined going forward. We . . . obviously don\u2019t want to be fooled again, like the industry was fooled last year by a little bit of an uptick in oil price and it is not sustainable. So, we\u2019re going to be disciplined and cautious going forward on ramping up capital until we\u2019re very much convinced that this is not a short-term uptick in the price, and that the market is more in balance, and that the price is more sustainable.\u201d \u2014 EOG Resources (EOG) chairman and CEO William Thomas (Oil Exploration and Production)\n\nDan Loeb sees more opportunities in debt than equity in energy markets.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re watching the energy markets very, very closely. We think that the better opportunities are on the credit side than on equities. As far as discounting, potential bad news ahead, we think the equities reflect more optimism about the price.\u201d \u2014 Third Point Reinsurance (TPRE) chief executive Dan Loeb (Reinsurance)\n\nMiscellaneous Nuggets of Wisdom\n\nIncentivize employees to think like owners.\n\n\u201cOur vision, values, and process are building the culture of ownership and empowerment necessary for the long-term achievements of our company.\u201d \u2014 Kraft Heinz (KHC) CEO Bernardo Hees (Packaged Food)\n\nThere are no hyper-rich economists.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t pay any attention to what economists say, frankly. . . . I mean, all these economists with 160 IQs and spending their life studying it. And can you name me one super wealthy economist who\u2019s ever earned money out of securities? No. I mean, just go down the list now.\u201d \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) chairman and CEO Warren Buffett (Conglomerate)\n\nYou\u2019d be better off in stocks if you didn\u2019t get a quote on them.\n\n\u201cI mean if I owned a McDonald\u2019s stand here in Omaha, I would not get a quote on it every day. . . . What I would think about is, \u2018How\u2019s this going to work over five years or 10 years?\u2019 I mean, people [are] going to keep eating hamburgers, they\u2019re going to like ours, and all of that sort of thing. And you\u2019d be better off in stocks if you did not get a quote on them.\u201d \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) chairman and CEO Warren Buffett (Conglomerate)\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing when robots displace people\u2019s jobs.\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if someday we got to the point where there were robots everyplace? They were running farms, they were running Apple, they were running Berkshire Hathaway. And all you had to do was one person could punch a button at the start of every morning and all the goods and services that we\u2019re getting now would be turned out by robots or whatever? And we\u2019d have the goods. We\u2019d have 18 million cars a year. You\u2019d have a million more housing starts. We\u2019d have all the iPads being sold. And if all of that came to one person pushing a button, would that be a tragedy? I mean, just think how how well we\u2019d live. Now we\u2019d have, instead of having to work 35 hours a week, we might work an hour a week or something of the sort. So, I mean, basically, the more output you can get from people, . . . it frees them up to do other things. And one of the things it frees them up to do is work less.\u201d \u2014 Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) chairman and CEO Warren Buffett (Conglomerate)\n\nIf you liked this post, don\u2019t forget to subscribe to the Enterprising Investor.\n\nAll posts are the opinion of the author.
