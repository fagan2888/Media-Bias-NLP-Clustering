PLEASANT \u2014 City officials reached a $350,000 settlement with two defendants in a multi-million dollar lawsuit involving the town\u2019s failed lagoon wastewater treatment facility.\n\nOn Thursday, City Attorney Tom Hardin said the city reached an agreement between Enviroworks Inc., a general contractor involved in the lagoon project, and its bonding company, Ohio Farmers Insurance Company.\n\nOhio Insurance will pay the city $350,000, Hardin said.\n\n\u201cThat helps clean up the lawsuit considerably,\u201d Hardin said. \u201cWe all very much concur that this is certainly a reasonable settlement from the city\u2019s perspective.\u201d\n\nNewly appointed City Commissioner Delores Blankenship made the motion that the city accept the offer during a special-called commission meeting. Blankenship was appointed and unanimously approved Thursday to fill an open seat left by her husband, Tom, who died in July.\n\nThe commission also unanimously approved to accept the $350,000 offer.\n\nMt. Pleasant filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit on April 6, 2011, naming the lagoon and spray field project engineer James C. Hailey &Co. as defendants.\n\nThe lagoon system was allegedly intended to treat the town\u2019s wastewater by using its former phosphate mines as the infrastructure. The system has experienced many issues, including several compliance violations from Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.\n\nAn amended complaint, filed June 18, 2012, added Enviroworks Inc. and Ohio Farmers Insurance as defendants.\n\nThe city owes the state about $6 million of an $8 million loan that it withdrew to fund the lagoon project.\n\nMt. Pleasant reached an agreement with the two defendants in which the city netted about a $500,000 return. The city held on to about $135,000 of retainer money that was not paid to Enviroworks and about $19,000 that the company requested in additional payments, Hardin said.\n\nThe city also avoided a $1.3 million counter suit from Enviroworks that alleged it did work which the city never paid for. Enviroworks agreed to forgo any claim to the retainer money, additional payment and the counter suit.\n\n\u201cThe net benefit to the city is a little more than $500,000, plus we get rid of their $1.3 million claim against us, and get rid of them,\u201d Hardin said.\n\n\u201cCleaning up the lawsuit is a good thing,\u201d Commissioner Chris Frierson added.\n\nThe city is now setting its sights on Hailey &Co. to finish out more than three years of litigation. Hardin said mediation is scheduled with Hailey in early October.\n\n\u201cWe can now focus our attention on the engineering firm,\u201d Hardin said. \u201cWe have made some progress with (Hailey), but none worthy of really discussing \u2026 .\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "MT.
