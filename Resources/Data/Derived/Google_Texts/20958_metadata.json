Sequestration lopped 2 percent off federal payments, while changes to the Medicare hospice wage index, initiated at the same time as Obamacare, have cut 4.2 percent from payments.\n\nBut the Affordable Care Act is the biggest culprit, cutting another 12 percent from payments to hospices over the next decade as part of a \u201cproductivity adjustment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know that under the Affordable Care Act that hospice programs are also going to see cuts to be reimbursement over the next five years,\u201d Husmann said. \u201cWhen we take that into account when we\u2019ve already started to see $365,000 or more a year in cuts, we\u2019ve realized that we\u2019re not going to be able to make enough money and keep a hospice residence open for business.\u201d\n\nHusmann said that while the in-patient Hospice House division of the company will close, the significantly more profitable side of the Hospice of Holland, which does home visits for hospice services, is doing well, growing despite smaller cuts.\n\nBut Obamacare\u2019s cuts to hospices, which will hit over the next decade, go to all hospice services across the board \u2014 so while the in-patient hospice center will be shut down, even the more profitable side of Husmann\u2019s business will take a hit due to the health care law.\n\nThe health care law included Medicare provider reimbursement cuts that expect to save the federal government $700 billion over the next decade, raising fears that fewer medical providers will begin seeing Medicare patients. In some cases, however, small businesses will be the ones to take the hit, triggering consolidation into larger medical complexes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have fewer hospices, you\u2019re just going to have larger hospices,\u201d Husmann said. \u201cThat\u2019s the trend that\u2019s going on right now, there are hospices in the state of Michigan that are either closing their doors or merging with larger hospices. That\u2019s a national trend as well.\u201d\n\nThe targeted cuts may be counterproductive, according to Husmann, because hospice services take fewer resources from federal entitlement programs than alternatives at hospitals.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of the sad part about this whole thing \u2014 there\u2019s enough studies out there that show that people who at the end of life get into hospice programs actually save Medicare and Medicaid billions of dollars compared to the last few week somebody spends in the [intensive care unite], but yet, under the Affordable Care Act, there are going to be cuts facing the hospice industry,\u201d Husmann concluded.\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "A Michigan hospice center is shutting down its own care home for sick patients partly due to Obamacare cuts, the business's director said Tuesday.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "A Michigan hospice center is shutting down its care home for sick patients, partly due to Obamacare cuts, the business's director said Tuesday.
