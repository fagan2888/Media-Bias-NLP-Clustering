I\u2019m in the gym around 5 a.m., four or five days a week (sometimes six), with a healthy mix of cardio/aerobic and strength-training routines.\n\nFor the past 4\u00bd years, spending time on treadmills has given me the opportunity to do a lot of people-watching. People-watching is one of those street-level educational opportunities for which you\u2019ll receive no award or diploma. However, with the proper mix of street-level and \u201cformal\u201d education, you will ultimately develop into a more well-rounded individual.\n\nOne of my many people-watching observations as I run the treadmill is the gym staff. Remember I said this was a no-frills type of gym, so there\u2019s nobody running around coaching or encouraging the members. It\u2019s just a bunch of in-shape and outta-shape folks alike, all trying to maintain or get into some other shape. Staff responsibility at this gym is to check people in, keep the place clean, troubleshoot machine problems and respond to customer inquiries or issues, not all that different than our responsibilities in the fire/EMS department, albeit at a less dramatic scale.\n\nAttention to detail guy vs. look good/smell good guy\n\nEvery day in my observations, I\u2019ve seen the intense \u201cattention-to-detail\u201d staff members and the \u201cis it time to leave yet?\u201d staff members. These observations have made me ponder how many of US are truly engaged and focus on attention to detail in our actions, and how many of us put on a fa\u00e7ade and are just watching the clock or sitting on the bench.\n\nThe \u201cattention-to-detail guy\u201d (he was a guy, so we\u2019ll use it as a generic term for our purposes) diligently cleans the machines, routinely tipping them from one side to the other to scrub and clean all the mechanisms. He finishes each machine then empties trash cans, fills spray bottles and vacuums the mats.\n\nIn the fire/EMS station, this is the guy who shows up for work early and checks their gear, radio and SCBA before heading out to check apparatus, making sure everything under their charge is in a tip-top shape of readiness.\n\nThen there\u2019s the gym staff member who I\u2019ve seen sleeping in their chair from time to time, while occasionally poking their head out into the abyss to see what\u2019s happening, sort of like a turtle sticking their neck out, albeit for different reasons. So the turtle decides to get up and do some work. That guy walks around with a feather duster and a can of deodorant spray, occasionally wafting the duster over the mirrors or on a machine with one hand, all the while walking and indiscriminately spraying the deodorant spray as he goes, all in view of the cameras to prove he\u2019s working. This is the \u201clook good/smell good guy.\u201d\n\nWhich are you?\n\nHow many of us are engaged in our fire and EMS service to the level that we\u2019re at least doing better than the look good/smell good guy? When you arrive at your station early, do you immediately check your gear every time? Do you immediately check your air cylinders and equipment? Are you spending time learning the area, drilling with new (and old) folks, cleaning apparatus, updating preplans, taking care of the station, and exercising?\n\nMotivate yourself to get off the couch or push away from the breakfast table and get out on the floor. When I was young(er) firefighter, I considered myself late if I got to work less than 1 hour ahead of schedule (and yes, I was and still am married and had young children; we made it work). But showing up early isn\u2019t enough. Jump into cleaning, checking your gear and apparatus, and ensuring everything is ready to go. For us, if there was any downtime, it was at 11 a.m. for lunch and The Price is Right. After that, it was back to the grind\u2014getting into the books, drilling, doing physical training, and, oh yes, running five or six calls somewhere in the mix.\n\nAre you wearing a uniform (of some kind), presentable in physical appearance, and cognizant of your language and actions, especially in public? Are you following the rules, protocols and procedures? Are you focusing on your primary mission of community service along with quality fire and EMS? Are you focused on fire prevention, public education and healthy life choices? Do you have a physical fitness plan?\n\nAre you deploying just as fast for EMS runs as you are for fire runs? I was in a fire station recently and heard the blaring voice from one of the firefighters over the station intercom announce, \u201cBOX ALARM, BOX ALARM, BOX ALARM\u201d followed by the pounding of feet and pole-sliding scurry to get on the wagon. I gotta tell you, I don\u2019t ever recall being in a station and hearing anyone blaring \u201cHEART ATTACK, HEART ATTACK, HEART ATTACK\u201d over the intercom. If anything, you\u2019d hear \u201cGUT BUCKET\u201d or \u201cMEAT WAGON\u201d or the like, followed by the sound of crickets as few rush to get on the ambulance. (A future article will focus on the changing face of EMS in the United States fire service as the Affordable Care Act takes hold. If the ACA\u2019s effect on prehospital EMS care and how that will impact the fire service has not been a wake-up call for you yet, it should be!)\n\nIn sum\n\nThe \u201clook good/smell good\u201d fa\u00e7ade message isn\u2019t just about daily and routine chores. You should not rest on the laurels of an obtained certification or credential. That\u2019s just the start. We have to constantly train and educate ourselves to the ever-evolving atmospheres and cultures around us. Attend conferences, exchange ideas, float thoughts up for consideration. In short, become part of the solution and be less of the problem.\n\nThe bottom line is that public safety officials\u2019 attention to detail saves lives\u2014the public\u2019s and our own. It is critical that we pay attention, stay fully focused, constantly size-up situations and put our full strength into preventing and ultimately preparing for prompt response, whether that is fire- or EMS-related.\n\nYou must be that attention-to-detail guy. In public safety, anything less is simply unacceptable. When it\u2019s all said and done, you can\u2019t allow yourself or those folks working with you to become that look good/smell good guy.\n\nMARC S.
