Michael Burgess has proven throughout his congressional tenure that he values constructive problem-solving over clamoring against the opposition.\n\nTake one of the most complicated issues that has bedeviled policymakers for decades: the quality and cost of health care. Burgess opposes the Affordable Care Act, but he has not wasted time with empty complaints. Instead, he has employed his own valuable perspective as a physician to improve the system wherever possible.\n\nBurgess, 65, is a reliable conservative on a wide variety of issues, one whose voice is informed and respected on both sides of the aisle.\n\nFor example, he is responsible for last year getting rid of the Sustainable Growth Rate, a troublesome calculation used to pay physicians for treating Medicare patients, and replacing it with a better formula. He also played a key role in reauthorizing the children\u2019s health care program to prevent it from expiring in states such as Texas.\n\nIn contrast, the knowledge and perspective that Burgess\u2019 two opponents in the Republican primary for the 26th Congressional District offer is painfully lacking.\n\nNeither small-business owner Joel Krause, 57, nor Realtor Micah Beebe, 31, displayed even a basic understanding of many critical issues, whether it be proposing realistic tax reform or prosecuting a war against ISIS. Nor has either apparently attracted the interest of supporters willing to donate to their campaigns.\n\nBeebe acknowledged that he doesn\u2019t even know Burgess\u2019 positions on key aspects of health care reform \u2014 despite being certain that the congressman\u2019s stance is wrong. Krause, who received less than 16 percent of the vote in his race against Burgess in 2014, vows to \u201ckeep running every two years\u201d because he enjoys the process so much.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to fathom how such perspectives serve voters in the least.\n\nThe winner of this primary will face Democratic opposition in November.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Incumbent is a reliable conservative whose voice is informed and respected on both sides of the aisle.", "og": {"description": "Incumbent is a reliable conservative whose voice is informed and respected on both sides of the aisle.", "title": "Editorial: We recommend Michael Burgess in GOP\u2019s race for 26th Congressional District", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20160122-editorial-we-recommend-michael-burgess-in-gops-race-for-26th-congressional-district.ece", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20160122-nm_10wildvoterpixa_37547910.ece/BINARY/original/NM_10WILDVOTERPIXA_37547910", "height": 961}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2016-01-22T16:34:09Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2016-01-22T16:34:09Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Editorial: We recommend Michael Burgess in GOP\\u2019s race for 26th Congressional District\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20160122-editorial-we-recommend-michael-burgess-in-gops-race-for-26th-congressional-district.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20160122-nm_10wildvoterpixa_37547910.ece/BINARY/original/NM_10WILDVOTERPIXA_37547910\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2621380\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-01-22T16:34:09Z\", \"section\": \"Editorials\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20160122-nm_10wildvoterpixa_37547910.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/NM_10WILDVOTERPIXA_37547910", "publishtime": "2016-01-22T16:34:09Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Take one of the most complicated issues that has bedeviled policymakers for decades: the quality and cost of health care.\nIn contrast, the knowledge and perspective that Burgess\u2019 two opponents in the Republican primary for the 26th Congressional District offer is painfully lacking.\nU.S. Rep.
