Two suspects were killed in two unrelated officer-involved shootings — both in south Denver — on Wednesday afternoon.

“Certainly this isn’t something we want to have happen,” Denver police commander Matt Murray said at the scene of the second shooting.

Police have not identified either victim.

The first shooting happened around 3 p.m. during an undercover drug operation in the parking lot at Overland Pond Park near South Platte River Drive and West Florida Avenue.

A man pulled a handgun when uniformed officers arrived for an arrest. He was shot several times by police and died at an area hospital, according to Chief Robert White.

The man had not fired his weapon.

“Fortunately, no one other than the suspect was injured,” White said.

White declined to elaborate on the undercover operation because it surrounded ongoing police work. He also declined to discuss whether other law enforcement agencies were involved in the operation.

The second shooting occurred at a funeral home on Tejon Street near West Elk Place. Police say four officers were attempting to serve felony vehicle-theft warrants to a 21-year-old suspect.

“I have no early indication that he had a weapon,” Murray said. Investigators are working to determine what made the officers who shot feel threatened.

The cause of the shooting is under investigation.

A witness said the suspect was attending a service at the Romero Family Funeral Home. Police did not confirm that account.

Officers swarmed the scene. Funeral attendees angry at the shooting swore and scuffled with officers and one officer was slightly injured, police said.

“I feel disrespected by the cops for doing that, for taking another life from us today while we’re mourning a life that’s been lost already,” attendee David Sandoval said standing near where the shooting happened.
