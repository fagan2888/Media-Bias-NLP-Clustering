The email goes after businessman Donald Trump, saying that he says \u201cdisgusting\u201d things and \u201cwants abortion outlawed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou opened this email, so I\u2019m going to make an assumption. You care a lot about this election and are pretty clued in,\u201d Heather Holdridge, Director of Digital Advocacy for Planned Parenthood, begins in the email.\n\nThe abortion company director then goes on to malign each of the three pro-life Republican presidential candidates on abortion:\n\nYou know Donald Trump has probably said more disgusting things about women than any candidate, well, ever. You know Ted Cruz threatened to shut down the government over defunding Planned Parenthood. You may even know John Kasich has enacted measures to restrict access to reproductive health care.\n\nSIGN THE PLEDGE: I Pledge to Vote for a Pro-Life Candidate for President\n\nWhat\u2019s one of the \u201cdigesting\u201d things the email alleges Trump said? The email then singles out Trump for criticism and points out how he previously said women should be punished for having an abortion if and when the day comes that abortion is illegal and unborn children are protected.\n\nDonald Trump says abortion should be outlawed, and when it is, \u201cThere should be some form of ________________\u201d for women who have illegal abortions. Fill in the blank! The next president could pick multiple Supreme Court justices \u2026ban abortion \u2026block access to care at Planned Parenthood health centers \u2026allow employers to deny birth control coverage \u2026roll back Obamacare. The list goes on and on. We need to make sure that every voter knows just how terrible ANY of these candidates would be for women\u2019s health and rights.\n\nThe fundraising email begs for \u201ceven more resources to stop Trump, Cruz, and Kasich.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Planned Parenthood Bashes Donald Trump: \"Disgusting\" That \"He Wants Abortion Outlawed\"", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "With Republican voters in Indiana heading to the polls today to select a GOP nominee for president, the Planned Parenthood abortion business has sent out a fund", "title": "Planned Parenthood Bashes Donald Trump:  \u201cDisgusting\u201d That \u201cHe Wants Abortion Outlawed\u201d", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2016/05/03/planned-parenthood-bashes-donald-trump-disgusting-that-he-wants-abortion-outlawed/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/donaldtrump16.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "keywords": "planned parenthood bashes donald trump:  \"disgusting\" that \"he wants abortion outlawed\",planned parenthood bashes donald trump:  disgusting that he wants abortion outlawed", "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4631\"", "article_summary": "The email goes after businessman Donald Trump, saying that he says \u201cdisgusting\u201d things and \u201cwants abortion outlawed.\u201d\u201cYou opened this email, so I\u2019m going to make an assumption.\nWith Republican voters in Indiana heading to the polls today to select a GOP nominee for president, the Planned Parenthood abortion business has sent out a fundraising email to its supporters.\nYou care a lot about this election and are pretty clued in,\u201d Heather Holdridge, Director of Digital Advocacy for Planned Parenthood, begins in the email.\nThe next president could pick multiple Supreme Court justices \u2026ban abortion \u2026block access to care at Planned Parenthood health centers \u2026allow employers to deny birth control coverage \u2026roll back Obamacare.\nYou know Ted Cruz threatened to shut down the government over defunding Planned Parenthood."}
