However, it is also clear that, should we do so, the impact on our stake holders, our students, faculty, staff and the community that we are a proud member of, would be devastating, and our first responsibility has to be our stake holders.\"\n\nThe letter said some faculty, students and staff had expressed fear of possible exposure. Even though there is \"minuscule risk,\" the fear might interfere with the relaxed exchange of information between the hosts and visitors, Reichgelt said in a telephone interview Monday afternoon.\n\nHe said only two of the 14 fellows who were to visit are from countries in which Ebola is epidemic, Liberia and Sierra Leone. He said USF-St. Pete officials asked the State Department whether they could host the other 12 journalists, but the answer was no -- all or nothing.\n\nUSF-St Pete\u2019s Department of Journalism and Media studies has hosted the Edward R. Murrow Visiting Journalists program, organized by the U.S. State Department, three times before. Last year, the campus hosted a forum of visiting African journalists.\n\nThis isn't the first visit by visiting African journalists that was canceled during the recent outbreak.\n\nThe University of Georgia has canceled a Liberian journalist's appearance on campus because of Ebola fears.\n\nAnd Syracuse University has \"disinvited\" a Washington Post photographer because he was in Liberia three weeks ago.\n\nHere's the letter from USF St. Petersburg:", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health News Florida", "description": "Officials at the University of South Florida St. Petersburg have canceled a five-day visit by 14 African journalists that was to begin Oct. 31, because of", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/usf-cancels-african-journalists-visit-ebola-fears-blamed", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201410/Murrow-Journalists-1024x472.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Officials at the University of South Florida St. Petersburg have canceled a five-day visit by 14 African journalists that was to begin Oct. 31, because of", "title": "USF Cancels African Journalists Visit; Ebola Fears Blamed"}, "story_id": 357641046, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Steve Newborn, Carol Gentry", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "USF Cancels African Journalists Visit; Ebola Fears Blamed"}, "nid": 8308, "datePublished": "2014-10-20", "keywords": "Ebola", "wordCount": 432, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdced8\"", "article_summary": "USF-St Pete\u2019s Department of Journalism and Media studies has hosted the Edward R.
