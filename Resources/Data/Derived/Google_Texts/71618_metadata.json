He said national and regional insurance carriers are developing smaller networks to compete on public and private exchanges.\n\nAbout 70 percent of new plans on the public health insurance exchanges offer narrower networks compared with many current employer plans, according to a recent McKinsey & Co. report. \u201cNarrow\u201d was defined as having at least 30 percent of the 20 largest hospitals in a geographic area not participating in the exchange\u2019s silver plan. The consulting firm studied 20 U.S. metropolitan areas, including Dallas.\n\nThe health maintenance organizations of the 1990s were instrumental in holding down costs. Consumers ultimately rejected them because of restrictions on what doctors or facilities\u2019 customers could use. However, price has become the paramount consideration for consumers and employers, insurers say.\n\nAccording to a PwC survey, 91 percent of insurers participating in the public exchanges believe consumers will care most about premiums, with concerns about out-of-pocket costs coming in a distant second. A separate consumer survey found that a majority of respondents preferred \u201cless expensive plans with a limited network of doctors and hospitals\u201d to \u201cmore expensive plans with a broader network of doctors and hospitals.\u201d\n\nSmaller networks are attractive to smaller businesses as well. A majority of small employers would choose a smaller provider network if it resulted in lower premiums, and that rose to 82 percent if the smaller network produced 20 percent lower premiums.\n\nA typical narrow network includes providers who agree to lower prices with the expectation that patient volume will grow. Insurers pass some of the savings on to consumers.\n\nNarrow networks have implications for providers regardless of whether they are included. Out-of-network providers are likely to see a decrease in market share while those in-network will have to absorb a decrease in commercial payer rates.\n\nTaylor pointed out that the savings of narrower networks are not significant. He said a 40 percent decrease in network size only produces a 5 percent savings, and a 75 percent increase translates to a 25 percent savings.\n\nBeth Wexler, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody\u2019s Investors Service, told Becker\u2019s Hospital Review narrow networks will not catch on as quickly in markets with several commercial payers.\n\n\u201cIt will depend on how dominant one payer is in the market,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere there\u2019s a good diversity of payers, it might be a little slower to come in terms of one payer taking the leap of faith that they\u2019re going to be the payer of choice.\u201d\n\nAbout 70 percent of U.S. metropolitan areas lack sufficient competition among insurers, according to a report by The American Medical Association. The Dallas and Fort Worth metropolitan areas are not among them, so narrow networks may develop more slowly locally.\n\nAbout 1 out of 4 companies are steering patients to high-quality providers, according to a 2013 Aon Hewitt employer survey, but more than 4 out of 5 plan to do so in 3-5 years. According to consultant Deloitte, narrow-network commercial PPO products could comprise 50 percent of the national employer business by 2015. Those plans typically offer the choices between a standard network and a second, more limited option of higher quality, or lower cost, providers.\n\nIn January 2013, Baylor Health Care System signed a contract with Imagine Health, a company based in Cottonwood Heights, Utah, that developed a provider network for two large, self-funded employers in the Dallas market. Aetna is the third-party administrator for the narrow network plan, which offers lower copays if employees and their dependents go to providers in the network.\n\nAllison Robbins, Imagine Health chief executive officer, said she anticipates the company\u2019s DFW network will be its largest U.S. market in terms of employees by 2015. Her company selects providers in the top quartile of quality measures and selects the provider based on negotiated rates, she said, and it augmented the DFW network with 100s of physicians and ancillary providers.\n\nImagine Health is in seven U.S. markets and expects to be in at least 10 by 2015. Robbins said the goal is to be in the 40 largest U.S. metropolitan areas within four years.\n\n\u201cWe look at quality first, and the byproduct for selection is that volume moves and the provider wins,\u201d when selecting providers for a local network, Robbins said. \u201cWe ask the provider for an appropriate rate for that.\u201d\n\nBruce Sammis, chief executive officer of Lockton Dunning Benefits in Dallas, said he believes the DFW market is in transition to the point where employers and providers are beginning to embrace narrow networks.\n\n\u201cIn DFW, three systems\u2014Baylor, Texas Health Resources, and HCA\u2014control 70 percent of the hospital market,\u201d he said. \u201cGoing forward, a new [narrow] network would not include all three and maybe not even two. Providers say they are willing to give better prices for incremental volume. They say they can save 15-20 percent if the network is sufficiently narrow and that they can impact care delivery and they don\u2019t have employees drifting all over town.\u201d\n\nDallas-based Mercer consultant Eric Bassett said employers have embraced higher-quality narrow networks as quality data has become more available.\n\nAccording to Mercer\u2019s 2013 national survey of employer-sponsored health plans, 16 percent of Dallas firms of at least 500 employees are using high-performance networks, compared with 24 percent in Texas and 15 percent in the U.S.\n\nSteve Jacob is founding editor of D Healthcare Daily and author of the book Health Care in 2020: Where Uncertain Reform, Bad Habits, Too Few Doctors and Skyrocketing Costs Are Taking Us.
