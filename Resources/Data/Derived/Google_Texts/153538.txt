A 21-year-old New York man is facing charges of forgery, theft by deception, aggravated assault on police and resisting arrest for allegedly using counterfeit money to make a purchase at a Walmart store.

According to police, around 8 p.m. May 20, police responded to the Walmart store, 1601 W. Edgar Road, for a report of a man attempting to purchase an iPad Mini with counterfeit money.

Employees in the electronics department said the man handed over five fake $100 bills for the $416.23 purchase. The employees thought the bills were fake.

When police arrived, the man, later identified as Shaqill Pluviose, 21, of Schenectady, New York, ran toward a door where he confronted another officer. The officer told Pluviose to stop, but he pushed a shopping cart into the officer, causing him to fall backward while Pluviose exited the store.

Other police officers chased the man as he discarded his shirt and ran to nearby railroad tracks after jumping over a fence. Additional officers who responded to the scene were able to apprehend Pluviose, who was sent to the Union County Jail in Elizabeth. His bail was set at $70,000, police said.
