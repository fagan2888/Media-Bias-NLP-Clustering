Few want to lose it either.\n\nIn parts of the county, about 1 in 8 people get insurance from the federal health-care program, making Gwinnett, near Atlanta, one of the biggest per capita users of the Affordable Care Act. The coverage is advertised in road signs along busy Jimmy Carter Boulevard near Lilburn. It\u2019s the reason enrollment has dropped at low-cost clinics in Snellville and Norcross. It\u2019s seeped into the Asian, Latino and African immigrant communities, becoming a mainstay for retail workers, contractors and the downsized.\n\nAs the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to rule on a case that could make Obamacare\u2019s private insurance unaffordable in Georgia and at least 33 other states, Gwinnett, where all five of the county commissioners belong to the Republican Party that has been leading the fight against the health care law, illustrates how for many the program has become a fact of life. Obamacare is both groused about and accepted, like taxes and the weather.\n\nGwinnett County, northeast of Atlanta\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t buy insurance for myself after my husband retired, not until Obamacare,\u201d said Ghada Nadhan, 63, an assistant manager of a food store who immigrated from Syria more than two decades ago. \u201cNow I am afraid.\u201d\n\nNow before the Supreme Court, the King v. Burwell case threatens to make Obamacare unaffordable by ending federal subsidies that hold down premium costs based on income. A suit backed by conservative activists, citing a single phrase in the law, says those subsidies aren\u2019t allowed in states that didn\u2019t create their own health-care exchanges.\n\nUndermining Obamacare\n\nLed by the free-market Cato Institute in Washington, those opponents helped persuade Republican governors not to form state-run exchanges, as a tactic for undermining Obamacare.\n\nMore than 13 million Americans could lose tax credits that help pay for insurance coverage by next year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation in Menlo Park, California. Florida, Texas, North Carolina and Georgia, the states with the most to lose, received a combined $19 billion, according to a December report by Democratic staff of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nAlso on Bloomberg Politics: Is Washington Ready for the Death of Obamacare?\n\nAll four states declined to create exchanges and could have spiraling premium increases if the court nixes their subsidies. In Georgia, premiums would rise 381 percent without the credits, according to a June 3 analysis by Kaiser.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that should be done based on a twisted interpretation of four words in, as we were reminded repeatedly, a couple-thousand-page piece of legislation,\u201d President Barack Obama said Monday at a news briefing in Germany. \u201cPart of what\u2019s bizarre about this whole thing is we haven\u2019t had a lot of conversation about the horrors of Obamacare because none of them have come to pass.\u201d\n\nIn Gwinnett, attitudes about Obamacare depend a lot on subsidies, said Luis De La Rosa, an insurance salesman who advertises in a Hispanic part of Lilburn. He says ending the federal help would be a disaster.\n\n\u201cThe people who say it doesn\u2019t work now are the people who aren\u2019t getting the subsidies and facing fines if they don\u2019t enroll,\u201d he said.\n\nThey\u2019re also people who aren\u2019t sick, he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an advantage people forget. Before, you couldn\u2019t get insurance if you were sick.\u201d\n\nRelated:\n\nGwinnett is a microcosm of a changing nation. Once overwhelmingly white, it\u2019s now one of the most ethnically diverse counties in the U.S., largely because of its immigrant population. It had 73,839 people enrolled in Obamacare\u2019s insurance exchange as of May, the most in the state. Two Gwinnett zip codes had 12 percent of residents enrolled in Obamacare, the most outside of Florida.\n\nObamacare has had the biggest impact on the area\u2019s low-cost medical facilities. At Gwinnett Community Clinic in Snellville, staff began calling former patients this year after a 30 percent enrollment drop.\n\n\u201cThe reason they were gone is that they now had insurance,\u201d director Sheila Adcock said.\n\nThe same thing happened in Norcross, at a clinic run by Boat People SOS. Daily caseloads dropped to 10 from 20 after the organization helped enroll immigrants in Obamacare, said Han Nguyen, a health navigator.\n\nEven enrollees with generous subsidies have complaints, said Adcock, who heard some during her phone outreach.\n\n\u201cIf you are a person in poverty, you\u2019re not used to the idea of co-pays and deductibles, and you\u2019re wondering what you are paying for,\u201d she said.\n\nPrecarious Premiums\n\nCharles Pierre, 58, a Haitian immigrant and substitute teacher, was among those signed up by Nguyen. He said his subsidized premium has already almost doubled, to $45 a month from $23, and that he also has a $35 co-pay to see a doctor.\n\nPierre said he likes the security the insurance brings but would have to drop it if the subsidy disappears and the price goes up again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a struggle for me to pay for it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I earn is not changed.\u201d\n\nValerie Dalton, 64, got her Obamacare insurance in February, after her banking job was eliminated and she could no longer afford the $700 monthly price to stay on her former employer\u2019s plan.\n\nShe said her Obamacare premiums are about $360 per month, a price she still thinks is high but that she won\u2019t have to pay for long. Next month she\u2019ll turn 65 and be eligible for Medicare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not politically active at all, but I feel badly that they are threatening this,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really sad.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Margaret Newkirk", "description": "In parts of Georgia\u2019s Gwinnett County, 1 in 8 residents receives health care through the Affordable Care Act.", "parsely-section": "politics", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "In parts of Georgia\u2019s Gwinnett County, 1 in 8 residents receives health care through the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "In Republican Stronghold, Worries About End of Obamacare", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-09/in-republican-stronghold-worries-about-end-of-obamacare", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i2VsaCXLJsR8/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "In parts of Georgia\u2019s Gwinnett County, 1 in 8 residents receives health care through the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "In Republican Stronghold, Worries About End of Obamacare", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-09/in-republican-stronghold-worries-about-end-of-obamacare", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i2VsaCXLJsR8/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"status": "In parts of Georgia\u2019s Gwinnett County, 1 in 8 residents receives health care through the Affordable Care Act."}, "parsely-title": "In Republican Stronghold, Worries About End of Obamacare", "parsely-tags": "Georgia,Health,Health Coverage,Region: Global,Page: article", "parsely-post-id": "NPO6C36KLVRH01", "parsely-author": "Margaret Newkirk", "date": "2015-06-09T09:00:03.354Z", "keywords": "Georgia,Health,Health Coverage", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Georgia,Health,Health Coverage", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-06-09T09:00:03.354Z", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/i2VsaCXLJsR8/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-06-09/in-republican-stronghold-worries-about-end-of-obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0428\"", "article_summary": "In Georgia\u2019s Gwinnett County where Republicans rule, few really love Obamacare.\nUndermining ObamacareLed by the free-market Cato Institute in Washington, those opponents helped persuade Republican governors not to form state-run exchanges, as a tactic for undermining Obamacare.\nShe said her Obamacare premiums are about $360 per month, a price she still thinks is high but that she won\u2019t have to pay for long.\nDaily caseloads dropped to 10 from 20 after the organization helped enroll immigrants in Obamacare, said Han Nguyen, a health navigator.\nTwo Gwinnett zip codes had 12 percent of residents enrolled in Obamacare, the most outside of Florida."}
