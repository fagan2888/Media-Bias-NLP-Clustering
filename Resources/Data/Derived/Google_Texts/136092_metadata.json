The new system, which will house all taxpayer data filed electronically, still lacks a functional security system, the audit said.\n\nCADE 2, which the Government Accountability Office called a \u201csuccessful major IT acquisition\u201d in 2011, now seems to be following in the footsteps of its predecessor, CADE 1 \u2013 which was the IRS\u2019s first attempt to modernize its taxpayer database.\n\nCADE 1 eventually fell two years behind schedule and went $37 million over budget due to inadequate definitions of system requirements and inaccurate cost and timeframe estimates, according to the GAO.\n\nIt was ultimately scrapped. In 2008 then-IRS commissioner Doug Shulman brought in an IT expert from Boeing, Terry Mulholland, to try again. Critics say transitioning the data from the old file to a new modern system was easily doable decades ago, and question why it has taken the IRS so long.\n\nCADE 2 is eventually supposed to replace the current Individual Master File (IMF) with a relational database. The new system will allow the IRS to update taxpayer accounts and process tax returns quickly and easily every day, compared to the current system, which can only be updated weekly. The IRS says CADE 2 will be a \u201ckey component of the IRS\u2019s data-centric technology strategy.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s if it doesn\u2019t meet the fate of CADE 1.\n\n\u201cI am troubled by these delays and the escalating costs associated with implementing this significant component of the IRS\u2019s modernization efforts,\u201d said J. Russell George of TIGTA. \u201cThe IRS needs to be aggressive in its efforts to resolve these problems.\u201d\n\nRelated: Incompetence and Abuse Call for a Clean Sweep of the IRS\n\nThis is just the latest example of the IRS\u2019s technology struggles. Just last week, TIGTA reported that the agency had failed to fix security weaknesses in its databases, leaving millions of taxpayers\u2019 financial information vulnerable to hackers.\n\nThe agency\u2019s lax IT security raises questions about whether it is positioned to take on new and crucial responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act, which will require the IRS to store even more sensitive health care information from taxpayers.\n\nUnder the new law, the IRS will enforce 45 new tax-related provisions, including imposing new taxes on medical devices and Medicare, overseeing new itemized deductions for medical expenses, and imposing penalties on uninsured Americans who fail to purchase coverage on the new exchanges.\n\nFollow Brianna Ehley on Twitter @BriannaEhley\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A key technology initiative at the Internal Revenue Service that was previously dubbed a \u201crare federal IT success story\u201d has missed its deadline and is tens of millions of dollars over budget.", "title": "The IRS\u2019s Unusual IT \u2018Success Story\u2019 is Failing", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/26/IRS-s-One-IT-Success-Story-Failing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05172013_IRS_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/11/26/IRS-s-One-IT-Success-Story-Failing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05172013_IRS_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A key technology initiative at the Internal Revenue Service that was previously dubbed a \u201crare federal IT success story\u201d has missed its deadline and is tens of millions of dollars over budget.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The new system, which will house all taxpayer data filed electronically, still lacks a functional security system, the audit said.\nThe IRS says CADE 2 will be a \u201ckey component of the IRS\u2019s data-centric technology strategy.\u201dThat\u2019s if it doesn\u2019t meet the fate of CADE 1.\n\u201cThe IRS needs to be aggressive in its efforts to resolve these problems.\u201dRelated: Incompetence and Abuse Call for a Clean Sweep of the IRSThis is just the latest example of the IRS\u2019s technology struggles.\n\u201cI am troubled by these delays and the escalating costs associated with implementing this significant component of the IRS\u2019s modernization efforts,\u201d said J.
