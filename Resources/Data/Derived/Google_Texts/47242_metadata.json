John Kasich championed a major rewrite of Ohio energy policies two years ago.\n\nBy Kasich\u2019s own description, the 2012 law accounted for newly accessible shale gas and embraced Ohio\u2019s renewable energy and efficiency targets as vital to the state\u2019s economy. The legislation was drawn from a heavily attended 21st Century Energy Summit.\n\nNow, the governor is ready to sign a bill freezing the very same renewables targets.\n\nKasich spokesman Rob Nichols said signing a bill that suspends Ohio\u2019s phase-in of clean-energy targets won\u2019t be a reversal by the governor. He said the targets were set six years ago, as part of a 2008 law passed under then-Gov. Ted Strickland, a Democrat.\n\n\u201cI can think of nothing more arrogant than to say that this law written six years ago shouldn\u2019t be re-evaluated in light of the energy realities around us,\u201d Nichols said.\n\nThe bill would suspend the targets for two years and, if lawmakers don\u2019t act within that period, the targets would resume in 2017.\n\nNichols said groups from across the political spectrum oppose the compromise that call for suspending the standards, with those on one side wanting them repealed and those on the other wanting them retained.\n\n\u201cThat tells us we\u2019re right where we need to be on this,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cWe\u2019re right in the sensible center.\u201d\n\nJack Shaner, of the Ohio Environmental Council, said any governor who supported alternative energy just two years ago should logically veto a proposal to freeze those standards when it hits his desk in 2014.\n\nThe council joins advanced energy interests - those companies that incorporate new technologies with traditional energy sources to reduce environmental harm - in pushing Kasich to veto the bill. Faith leaders, civil-rights activists and others also want a veto.\n\n\u201cThis is anything but the sensible center,\u201d Shaner said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to put Ohio on the radical, anti-clean energy fringe.\u201d\n\nOhio is among more than half of the states that have set renewable energy targets for utilities. The state\u2019s 2008 law required utilities to generate 25 percent of their power from alternative sources by 2025, half of that from advanced sources, such as cleaner coal plants, and half from renewable sources, such as solar and wind.\n\nThe American Legislative Exchange Council, a policy advisory group dominated by Republicans, is a leading force behind the push against such targets. Ohio is among states to which the council provided model legislation eliminating renewables targets, which it dubbed the Electricity Freedom Act.\n\nOpponents of the targets include Senate Public Utilities Chairman Bill Seitz, a Cincinnati Republican active in the legislative exchange council, who has sometimes cited Ohio\u2019s shale gas boom for changing the state\u2019s energy landscape and prompting the latest bill.\n\nShaner calls that claim \u201cbogus,\u201d noting that shale drilling was prominently featured at Kasich\u2019s summit. It was also mentioned during the rollout of the 2012 law.\n\nKasich worked with lawmakers to strike a compromise to full repeal of Ohio\u2019s renewables standard that was backed by Seitz and others. With legislative leaders, he negotiated the two-year suspension in place of a permanent moratorium.\n\nThe 2014 bill he plans to sign suspends only the renewables standards, however. It eliminates the advanced energy standard that Kasich\u2019s 2012 energy law embraced and expanded to add co-generation and waste heat recovery. The earlier law also invested $30 million in taxpayer dollars to develop advanced energy technologies in clean coal.\n\nNichols said Kasich believes in \u201cre-evaluating everything\u201d and that includes renewables mandates that appear to be creating jobs in the wind and solar fields only through heavy subsidies.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the governor\u2019s for renewables,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cBut it\u2019s got to be done in a commonsense manner.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican Gov.
