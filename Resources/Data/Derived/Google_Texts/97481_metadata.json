President Obama\u2019s goal in the last two years of his presidency is to deplete the Guant\u00e1namo prison to the point where it houses 60 to 80 people and keeping it open no longer makes economic sense.\n\nHmmm. Will Republicans be willing to close Guant\u00e1namo if it no longer makes economic sense to keep it open? Color me skeptical. This is a tough-on-terrorism issue, not a budget issue. If I had to guess, I'd say that Republicans would refuse to close Guant\u00e1namo if there were even a single prisoner left there. If it becomes a US version of Spandau, well, that's just fine. Closing it is for appeasing, weak-kneed, liberals, not rock-jawed severe conservatives.\n\nIn fact, I could easily see this becoming a stock question during the Republican primaries. \"Would you ever close Guant\u00e1namo?\" The candidates will then take turns trying to top each other with ever more absurdly hawkish answers, the same way they did with immigration in 2012. Like this:\n\nCandidate 1: I will never close Guant\u00e1namo. These are the most dangerous people in the world. Candidate 2: Not only wouldn't I close it, I'd expand it. Candidate 3: Expand it and make it more secure. I'd build a moat. Candidate 4: And an electrified fence. Candidate 5: I'd take away their Obamacare!\n\nAt that, everyone would look admiringly at Candidate 5 and silently give him the victory.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/01/republicans-will-never-allow-guant\u00e1namo-be-closed", "type": "article", "image": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "site_name": "Mother Jones", "title": "Republicans will never allows Guant\u00e1namo to be closed"}, "twitter": {"creator": "kdrum", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2015/01/republicans-will-never-allow-guant\u00e1namo-be-closed", "image": {"src": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg", "identifier": "/sites/all/assets/mojo_nomaster.jpg"}, "title": "Republicans will never allows Guant\u00e1namo to be closed", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "2016+Elections,Obama,Prisons", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfcdd\"", "article_summary": "Will Republicans be willing to close Guant\u00e1namo if it no longer makes economic sense to keep it open?\nIf I had to guess, I'd say that Republicans would refuse to close Guant\u00e1namo if there were even a single prisoner left there.\nLike this:Candidate 1: I will never close Guant\u00e1namo.\n\"Would you ever close Guant\u00e1namo?\"\nPresident Obama\u2019s goal in the last two years of his presidency is to deplete the Guant\u00e1namo prison to the point where it houses 60 to 80 people and keeping it open no longer makes economic sense."}
