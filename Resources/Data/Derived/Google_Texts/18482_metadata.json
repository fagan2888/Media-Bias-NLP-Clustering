They are Austin, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.\n\nThe Lowcountry, where Boeing Co. builds airplanes and Daimler and Volvo plan $500 million new auto-manufacturing plants, is also experiencing a job and population boom. Unemployment for the Charleston area is down to 5.4 percent and the Charleston Metro Chamber of Commerce estimates the Lowcountry is gaining an average of 43 new residents a day.\n\n\u201cAs home prices rose significantly since 2013, homes have become less affordable, and, therefore, home prices less sustainable,\u201d CoreLogic said.\n\nMedian home prices in Charleston in 2013 were $206,530, according to Charleston Trident Association of Realtors. Last month, the agency reported the median home price was $220,000, a 6.5 percent increase over 2013.\n\nThe other two cities on the CoreLogic list are Miami and Washington, D.C.\n\nDesigns on Charleston\n\nKSQ Architects, a national architecture and engineering firm, has opened an office in Charleston after the former Clancy Wells Architects folded into the business.\n\nLed by principals Mark Clancy and Steve Wells, the Charleston office will focus on serving current and prospective clients in practice areas that include the K-12, higher education, health care and mixed-use markets. Clancy Wells was established in 2005.\n\n\u201cThe experience and knowledge Mark and Steve bring to our firm is pivotal to our growth in the Southeast,\u201d said KSQ principal and director Armand Quadrini. \u201cBoth culturally and portfolio-wise, they are an excellent fit for us, and we look forward to our extended reach with their help.\u201d\n\nClancy added, \u201cThis new relationship provides a wealth of resources and opportunities to broaden the scope of what we can provide our clients in South Carolina. With our established relationship with the staff in KSQ\u2019s Charlotte office, we have all the ingredients here for future success.\u201d\n\nKSQ has other offices in Denver, Charlotte, Oklahoma and White Plains, N.Y.\n\nModeling\n\nCresswind at The Ponds now offers eight model homes catering to the 55-plus buyer in Summerville.\n\nThe Kolter Homes models at 324 Hundred Oaks Parkway are open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday and noon to 5 p.m. Sunday.
