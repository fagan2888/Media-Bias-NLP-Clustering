The Supreme Court does not have a Twitter account. SCOTUSblog, the unofficial official source for all things Supreme Court, does have Twitter account. That account takes great pains to alert users that they are “A private blog. NOT THE JUSTICES OR THE COURT.”

However, following the Supreme Court’s ruling yesterday in King v Burwell, which upheld subsidies for health insurance purchased through federally-run state exchanges, angry conservatives missed the memo, angrily tweeting at @SCOTUSblog to express their outrage over what they thought was “their” ruling.

And SCOTUSblog had some fun with them, tweetstorming some of the best messages with appropriately sarcastic replies:

There was some confusion today about the difference between @SCOTUSblog and the Supreme Court. Prepare for the running of the trolls. — SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015

Interpret this: YOU SUCK AT GRAMMAR (and government) MT @love2godown21 Interpret this @SCOTUSblog Your WRONG! — SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015

Sry, thought Congress had passed it; our bad MT @AllAmerVet @SCOTUSblog wtf. Goes against majority of Americans! — SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015

Um, that’s @Congressblog, duh MT @robbiehart21 #whatilearnedtoday the @SCOTUSblog is now part of congress — SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015

Just bc they have “cancer,” ooooooh MT @517afd @SCOTUSblog decided it’s ok if working stiffs pay subsidies to ppl who will not work — SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015

On both knees [wink] #Giveitatry MT @LKVents @SCOTUSblog bows down to Obama. #Disgusting — SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015

To be fair, a few Twitter users who were happy with the ruling made the same mistake. They weren’t spared, either:

Cool; though “dude” is a bit disrespectful -Ginsburg MT @walkershockley I’m just like, @SCOTUSblog don’t fuck up #Pride2015 dude — SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015

Perhaps the best one was from Republican Senator Johnny Isakson, whose staff really ought to have known better:

Didn’t read it. You, Senator? MT @SenatorIsakson Disappointed @SCOTUSblog failed to recognize how terribly flawed @POTUS health care law is. — SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015

Isakson later deleted the tweet and replaced it with one using the #SCOTUS hashtag instead of the @SCOTUSblog account. At the end of the day, the exchanges — and the day as a whole — could best be summed up with this one:

Look up “blog” MT @BetsyKerr @SCOTUSblog You got it wrong. Don’t know how to read? “State” means “state.” — SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015

And either Friday or Monday with this one:

LOL, 2morrow gonna blo ur mind MT @highbritt @SCOTUSblog Thanks for giving us yet another very sorry day for our country. — SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 26, 2015

Never change, @SCOTUSblog. Never change.
