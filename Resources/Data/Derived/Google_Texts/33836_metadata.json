It was the first time in over 50 years (and just the second time in the republic) that such a write-in candidate won a seat in the U.S. Senate \u2014 the only other was Strom Thurmond\u2019s South Carolina victory in 1954.\n\nMurkowski prevailed thanks to a broad coalition of support. Anti-establishment and Tea Party favorite Joe Miller was the Republican Party nominee. On the left, Scott McAdams ran atop the Democratic Party ticket. Murkowski campaigned as a moderate Republican, picking up support from independents, moderate Democrats, and establishment Republicans.\n\nIt worked. About 10,000 votes ultimately separated Murkowski and Miller, with McAdams a distant third.\n\nSix years later, Murkowski is the 13th most senior member in the Senate Republican majority and serves as chair of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. But she is also running in a presidential election year that thus far has overwhelmingly favored anti-establishment, far-right candidates, like business mogul Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).\n\nGovernor John Kasich (R-Ohio), the most ideologically similar candidate to Murkowski \u2014 currently running a campaign reminiscent of President George W. Bush\u2019s \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d in 2000 \u2014 has managed to obtain just six percent of primary delegates. He\u2019s said if he can\u2019t secure his home state of Ohio, he\u2019ll call it a day.\n\nAlaska\u2019s GOP caucus voters almost neatly divided themselves between Cruz and Trump, with Kasich earning only 892 (about 4 percent) of over 21,000 ballots cast. That could once again leave Murkowski susceptible. If a GOP primary candidate felt particularly inspired to launch a Miller-esque bid, this is a good year to do it.\n\nBut Stock is taking a much different tack. A lifelong Republican up until a few weeks ago, the 28-year U.S. Army reservist, Ivy League grad, and MacArthur \u201cGenius\u201d Award recipient (and, full disclosure, my former Constitutional Law professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage) Stock has decided to run as an independent. She says she felt compelled to jump into the race because Murkowski hasn\u2019t been the strong senator that Alaskans deserve.\n\nThe beef with Murkowski\n\n\u201cThe big thing I think Alaskans don\u2019t like about Sen. Murkowski is she doesn\u2019t hold her ground on anything, you know?\u201d she told me Sunday afternoon at Steam Dot in Anchorage. \u201cShe takes a position in order to get elected. She did that when she was running last time. And then as soon as the pressure comes from the national party she flips.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe majority of Alaskans have rejected the parties, and so it doesn\u2019t make any sense for our senator to kowtow to the National Republican Party,\u201d she continued, noting that 54 percent of voters in the state are independent. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point? It\u2019s not helping our state. And on a whole range of issues she\u2019s been doing things that help the national party and help the Lower 48 \u2014 but they don\u2019t help Alaskans.\u201d\n\nClimate change was one example, she said. Alaska is experiencing climate change at a more accelerated pace than much of the Lower 48. Villages like Kivalina, Newtok, Koyukuk, and Shishmaref will have to be relocated due to rising water levels and coastal erosion. Murkowski\u2019s ascension to Chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee gave her ample power to act on Alaska\u2019s behalf. Stock says she has failed to do so.\n\n\u201cShe talks a lot, but doesn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Stock said. \u201cShe\u2019s the chair of the Energy Committee. She\u2019s got a great deal of power which she should be using to mitigate climate change effects in Alaska and she\u2019s not doing that. In fact, she\u2019s doing things that are going to make it worse up here.\u201d\n\nMurkowski, for instance, acknowledged climate change shortly after the 2014 election that put the GOP in the driver\u2019s seat.\n\n\u201cI come from a state where we see a warming. We\u2019re seeing it with increased water temperatures; we\u2019re seeing it with ice that is thinner; we\u2019re seeing it with migratory patterns that are changing,\u201d Murkowski was quoted by The Hill on election night. But she then said that the causes were unclear, referencing a volcano in Iceland. \u201cThe emissions that are being put in the air by that volcano are a thousand years\u2019 worth of emissions that would come from all of the vehicles, all of the manufacturing in Europe.\u201d\n\nIt was a comment Princeton professor and climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer called \u201csimply untrue.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need federal money to mitigate the effects of climate change. We\u2019re not going to be turning it away. That makes no sense. Resiliency is absolutely critical,\u201d Stock, who has served on the board of Prince William Sound Science Center, countered. \u201cThe key thing there is you have to have the money to make these communities resilient or they disappear.\u201d\n\nShe criticized the president\u2019s summer visit to Alaska as well, saying that his remarks on climate change were good speeches, but bore little in terms of specific policy.\n\nAnd there is no shortage of other issues that concern her. In June, Murkowski voted against a defense bill amendment that would have sped up the process of bringing a new Coast Guard icebreaker to Alaska. She also expressed concern over Murkowski\u2019s voting record on opioid addiction funding and women\u2019s health.\n\nFocus on veterans\u2019 issues\n\nOne area Margaret Stock is very interested in is veterans\u2019 affairs. The retired lieutenant colonel and former professor at West Point says that she has a lot of support from veterans, and she would work to serve on the Veterans Affairs Committee. Prior to being unseated in 2014, Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) held a seat on the committee.\n\nParticularly, Stock wants to work to improve access to health care through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of clients and people I\u2019ve recruited for the military who are working in the Veterans Administration. People are frustrated with the bureaucracy and how the delivery of health care is happening,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously improvements that can be made, and it takes focus. And one of the things you can do as a senator, you can ask for hearings and you can push the bureaucracy to do things the right way, and of course try to get them funding so they can do things the right way.\u201d\n\nGOP candidates in the presidential election have increasingly suggested elements of the V.A. should be privatized. But Stock disagrees, pointing to what she calls flaws in the Obama Administration\u2019s signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\n\u201cIf we try to mirror the civilian health care system in the V.A. \u2014 do we really want the breakdown that we\u2019ve had with the Affordable Care Act?\u201d she replied.\n\nThe last thing we want to do is take health care away from veterans and then create massive new bureaucracies and paperwork. Talking to veterans, they think there\u2019s problems at the V.A. but it\u2019s working better than the civilian health care sector is working right now. So, the trick is to take the good things that work and preserve them and then improve the bad, not just throw the baby out with the bathwater.\n\nIn regards to the ACA, Stock says she\u2019s seen issues as a small business owner with employees purchasing health insurance through the exchange. When the cost of premiums surpassed the penalty for not having insurance, it no longer made economic sense for many people to buy in, she said. But Stock also isn\u2019t okay with scrapping the ACA entirely.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing about the act is that it was originally a Republican idea. It was supposed to be a market-based solution to the health care crisis. And because people are trying to undercut it, it\u2019s made things worse,\u201d she said, emphasizing the problems with its initial implementation. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to solve a problem just by repealing the Affordable Care Act with nothing to replace it. That\u2019s not a solution.\u201d\n\nHyperpartisanship in the U.S. Senate and the Trump phenomenon\n\nThe office Margaret Stock is running for has, in recent years, been plagued by hyperpartisanship counterintuitive to compromise. As a result, the vast majority of issues facing the American people have been left unaddressed. I asked her how she viewed the political brinksmanship while wearing her cap as a former professor with the West Point Department of Law, Department of Social Sciences, and as a constitutional law professor at UAA.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s destructive,\u201d she replied flatly. \u201cThe whole point of the U.S. Constitution was to force people to compromise with each other. That\u2019s the way it\u2019s set up structurally. And what\u2019s happened is Congress has gotten so dysfunctional that they\u2019ve essentially ceded all their power to the executive branch, and then they attack the executive branch but they don\u2019t do anything to counteract that power.\u201d\n\nWhen I broached the topic of Donald Trump, she said that an electorate admiring a \u201cstrongman\u201d candidate was problematic in the American political tradition.\n\nThat\u2019s not American democracy. People should admire it when Congress can hold its own, and the executive branch holds its own, and the judiciary holds its own. There\u2019s a balancing act there. If one branch gets too strong and we admire that, we\u2019re going to end up with an imperial, authoritarian presidency. That\u2019s not American democracy. So, we need to get back to that center, and the polarization prevents the center from functioning.\n\nStill, Stock is optimistic. She says that so far she\u2019s been having a great time running and can\u2019t wait to hit the campaign trail; plans are in the works to head to places like Cordova, Barrow, Dillingham, Juneau, Sitka, and Ketchikan.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be running if I didn\u2019t have hope,\u201d Stock said with a smile. \u201cIf we all just sit back and let other people that haven\u2019t been effective continue to mosey along, we\u2019re not going to fix the system. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m running.\u201d\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "Independent U.S. Senate candidate Margaret Stock weighs in on her opponent, Donald Trump, the state of American democracy, and much more.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "John Aronno", "og": {"site_name": "Alaska Commons", "description": "Independent U.S. Senate candidate Margaret Stock weighs in on her opponent, Donald Trump, the state of American democracy, and much more.", "title": "U.S. Senate Candidate Margaret Stock Sounds Off On Murkowski, Trump, and the State of American Politics - Alaska Commons", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://acmedia.alaskacommons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/U.S.-Senate-Candidate-Margaret-Stock-Sounds-Off-On-Her-Opponent-The-Campaign-and-the-State-of-American-Politics-cover.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-13T16:09:48+00:00", "url": "http://www.alaskacommons.com/2016/03/13/20160313u-s-senate-candidate-margaret-stock-sounds-off/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Independent U.S. Senate candidate Margaret Stock weighs in on her opponent, Donald Trump, the state of American democracy, and much more.", "creator": "@alaskacommons", "image": "http://acmedia.alaskacommons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/U.S.-Senate-Candidate-Margaret-Stock-Sounds-Off-On-Her-Opponent-The-Campaign-and-the-State-of-American-Politics-cover.jpg", "title": "U.S. Senate Candidate Margaret Stock Sounds Off On Murkowski, Trump, and the State of American Politics - Alaska Commons", "site": "@alaskacommons", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 563153020}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://acmedia.alaskacommons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/cropped-AC-Logo-Tester-290x290.jpg", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/alaskacommons", "section": "John Aronno: On Politics", "tag": "West Point", "published_time": "2016-03-13T20:42:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-13T16:09:48+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Anti-establishment and Tea Party favorite Joe Miller was the Republican Party nominee.\nPeople are frustrated with the bureaucracy and how the delivery of health care is happening,\u201d she said.\nbut it\u2019s working better than the civilian health care sector is working right now.\n\u201cIf we try to mirror the civilian health care system in the V.A.\nIt was supposed to be a market-based solution to the health care crisis."}
