(http://www.giveforward.com)\n\nOPINION\n\nLast fall, Siemienkowicz, a freelance illustrator and graphic designer, knew something wasn\u2019t right, healthwise. Some 40 pounds had dropped from his 185-pound runner\u2019s frame in a month\u2019s time. And, he wasn\u2019t sure if his eyes were playing tricks on him, but damned if it didn\u2019t look like his skin had taken on a yellow hue.\n\nTiming\u2019s everything, and the Ravenswood resident\u2019s wasn\u2019t good. He had just become eligible for coverage under the Affordable Care Act, and as he was rushing to get insurance, he realized his health couldn\u2019t wait. A battery of tests uncovered stage 3 pancreatic cancer and it had to be tackled immediately.\n\nHe was lucky, though, in that his cancer was operable and so, as he describes it, \u201cI had 5 pounds of guts taken out and I was put back together.\u201d\n\nCancer had spread to the lymph nodes, so four months of chemotherapy followed. Right now he\u2019s finishing up five weeks of a combination of chemotherapy and radiation. Though the medicines and procedure have left him foggy and extremely fatigued, the 41-year-old Siemienkowicz says he\u2019s \u201clooking forward to getting back to work, to life.\u201d\n\nAs this all was unfolding and as the shock of what the medical treatment would cost \u2013 the first call he got was from the hospital\u2019s finance department (\u201cpay in full by Friday\u201d and he\u2019d qualify for a discount. Such a deal.) \u2013 Siemienkowicz knew he didn\u2019t have the funds to pay for it, nor, in his words \u201ca wife\u2019s insurance at work or rich parents\u201d to save the day.\n\nBut what he did have was a group of loyal and resourceful friends and clients who organized and started fundraising for him. He has a page on the Bucktown-based Giveforward, an online fundraising/donation website. (Since its beginning in August of 2008, the website says donors have given close to $165 million to help individuals pay medical expenses.)\n\nBut back to the telethon, which promises to have its wacky moments. Siemienkowicz and his team knew they had to do something creative so his appeal would stand out. And with that, the telethon was born.\n\n\u201cI know so many talented people,\u201d the humorous Siemienkowicz said, so he decided to tap them for the telethon, which will continue from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. on Friday. So far he has about 20 confirmed \u201cpersonalities,\u201d mostly from the Chicago area, but some from elsewhere, including Canada (ah, the beauty of the Internet). There are musicians and storytellers. A friend who\u2019s a pro at yoga will demonstrate good moves one can do in the office. Swing dancers will perform at locations around the city. Oh, I almost forgot the Star Wars trivia!\n\nYes, the telethon will help pay what Siemienkowicz owes (It\u2019s cleverly called Bills & Ed\u2019s Excellent Telethon). And will help him financially, until he can work at full capacity again. But the people who reach out and help him \u2013 the familiar and total strangers from as far away as Europe and Australia \u2013 boy, they inspire him.\n\n\u201cThey are totally motivating and have kept me afloat,\u201d he says\n\nOn Friday, check out the telethon and see what friendship can bring when one\u2019s in need.\n\nEmail: sueontiveros.cst@gmail.com\n\nTwitter: @sueontiveros", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Who doesn\u2019t enjoy the occasional interlude on the Internet while at work?</p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/ontiveros-internet-telethon-aims-to-cover-one-mans-medical-bills/", "site": "@suntimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ontiveros: Internet \u2018telethon\u2019 aims to cover one man\u2019s medical"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282828", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "Chicago News, Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Weather and More", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://chicago.suntimes.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/opinion/ontiveros-internet-telethon-aims-to-cover-one-mans-medical-bills/", "type": "article", "site_name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "title": "Ontiveros: Internet \u2018telethon\u2019 aims to cover one man\u2019s medical bills"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Ontiveros: Internet \u2018telethon\u2019 aims to cover one man\u2019s medical billsWho doesn\u2019t enjoy the occasional interlude on the Internet while at work?\nYes, the telethon will help pay what Siemienkowicz owes (It\u2019s cleverly called Bills & Ed\u2019s Excellent Telethon).\nThis Friday, when you\u2019re looking for a distraction, stop by Ed Siemienkowicz\u2019s novel idea in his fight against the bills pancreatic cancer brought: an Internet telethon via Google hangout.\n(Since its beginning in August of 2008, the website says donors have given close to $165 million to help individuals pay medical expenses.)\n(http://www.giveforward.com)OPINIONLast fall, Siemienkowicz, a freelance illustrator and graphic designer, knew something wasn\u2019t right, healthwise."}
