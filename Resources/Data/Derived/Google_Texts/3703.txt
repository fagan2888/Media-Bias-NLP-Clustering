While the Supreme Court has federalized the Second Amendment over the last decade, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit voted to uphold San Francisco’s gun control law.

According to Reason, the San Francisco law mandates that handguns in the city that gun owners keep at home be “stored in a locked container or disabled with a trigger lock.”

The 9th Circuit ruling in favor of the law in Jackson v. San Francisco stated the law, “does not substantially burden the right or ability to use firearms for self-defense in the home.”

The ruling is contradictory to the Supreme Court’s ruling in the 2008 decision District of Columbia v. Heller.

In Heller, the Supreme Court struck down Washington D.C.’s requirement that all firearms in the home be kept “unloaded and dissembled or bound by a trigger lock or similar device.”

In a private meeting Friday, the Supreme Court justices considered a petition from conservative lawyer Paul Clemente. The petition calls for the Supreme Court to review the Ninth Circuit’s opinion on Jackson and give a summary reversal.

Summary reversal would allow the court to overturn a lower court’s ruling without hearing any oral arguments or additional briefing.
