For one thing, hard-right conservatives were promised that President Obama and his agenda would be vanquished, and yet both he and his namesake \u2014 Obamacare \u2014 remain in place. For another, the anger can be gleaned from pretty much any paragraph spoken by Sen. Bernie Sanders about the rigged economy delivering most of the growth to the top 1 percent.\n\nThat\u2019s apparent in what I think of as the \u201c\u2019Big Short\u2019 sigh.\u201d There\u2019s a point in that (excellent) movie when the narrator says, referring to the financial \u201cinnovators\u201d who brought you the housing bubble and the Great Recession, \u201cand they all went to jail \u2026 just kidding!\u201d In fact, the narrator points out, they got bailed out, regained their profitability and quickly got back to \u201cinnovating.\u201d\n\nAt which point, the audience let out a huge, collective sigh. People are still pissed off about that one.\n\n[The Fix: Why Bernie Sanders\u2019s win in Michigan matters so much]\n\nThe electorate\u2019s anger is also fueled by a more basic manifestation of the inequitable economy that even Donald Trump has lamented: the long-term stagnation of wages for various groups of workers. Tom Edsall argues that \u201c[T]he economic basis for voter anger has been building over forty years.\u201d Bill Galston stresses that when the \u201cimplicit bargain between average citizens and their leaders\u201d \u2014 you work hard, you get ahead \u2014 \u201cbreaks down because leaders don\u2019t live up to their side of the bargain, all bets are off.\u201d A group of Washington Post reporters contends that the anger behind Trump\u2019s ascendancy \u201cis more than just anger at the political class or rebellion against political correctness. It reflects decades of lost jobs and falling wages for a swath of blue-collar Americans, who saw their opportunities diminish and developed a sense that someone has stolen something from them.\u201d\n\n[Why Donald Trump is winning]\n\nIn order to dig a bit deeper into these claims, I\u2019ve been looking into the wage and income trends behind them. Here is the first installment of what I\u2019m finding, and as one friend to whom I showed the data succinctly put it: \u201cNo wonder they\u2019re angry.\u201d\n\nFirst, the Bureau of Labor Statistics provides a long, historical look at the real hourly earnings of production, or blue-collar, workers in manufacturing. The story couldn\u2019t be simpler: their hourly wage doubled from the 1940s to the 1970s but has flat-lined since. We could stop here and you\u2019d get the picture (and consider the results of last night\u2019s primary in Michigan as you look at the figure).\n\nSource: BLS, CPI-RS deflator\n\nAnd remember, while the BLS only counts employed workers who report wages, we know that the employment rates of non-college-educated men have gone down as they\u2019ve lost factory jobs over the years. That reality is a related source of voter anger, particularly in the rust belt, and it\u2019s an important factor in the wage trend above.\n\nThe next figure gets at this job loss problem by including men who\u2019ve dropped out of the job market (i.e., they get a zero in these computations; thanks to CBPP\u2019s Arloc Sherman for running the data for me). The figure shows the real median and 25th percentile annual earnings of white men aged 25-54 years old, including zeroes. (If you\u2019re in that age range and didn\u2019t work, we keep you in the sample. Or, if you only worked half the year, you\u2019re in there, too.)\n\nAnd what a dismal plot it is. For both low- and middle-earning white guys, there\u2019s a small bump up in the full-employment 1990s, though no great shakes. But since 2000, it\u2019s stagnation and worse. The real median wage is down 14 percent since then; the real low wage is down a whopping 26 percent.\n\nSource: Census ASEC database, CPI-RS deflator\n\nBoth pictures clearly support the above assertions connecting anger to paychecks: decades of stagnant earnings for blue-collar factory workers and sharp declines in the real earnings of middle- and low-wage white men.\n\nI\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t news to many readers. The Economic Policy Institute has been tracking such wage trends for years. (It will soon be releasing its 2015 wage decile results; I\u2019ve seen them and they\u2019re really interesting, but my lips are sealed for now.) And there are always caveats when looking at any such series. These data don\u2019t follow individuals over time, so they don\u2019t capture the \u201cage-wage profile:\u201d the fact that an individual\u2019s earnings tend to rise with experience. And recent analysis suggests that controlling for the composition of wage earners can make a difference over time as well.\n\nBut accounting for these nuances would not change the story. There is a demonstrable link between real earnings and real anger.\n\nThe question is, do any of the candidates have real solutions? In fact, some do and some don\u2019t.
