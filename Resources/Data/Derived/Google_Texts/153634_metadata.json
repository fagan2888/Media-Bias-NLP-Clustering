And it\u2019s an argument being raised\u2014perhaps ironically\u2014by groups that several years ago were some of the fiercest opponents of President Barack Obama\u2019s signature policy achievement back when we were in the throes of a nasty legislative war that scarred relations between the White House and Congress for years to come.\n\nFast-forward to today, and we find the ACA becoming something of a boon for insurance companies and hospitals. When the threat of a disappearing ACA looms as a conservative Supreme Court deliberates the law\u2019s fate in King v. Burwell, best believe those who stand to lose much will become the law\u2019s loudest supporters.\n\nHence, arguing in defense of Obamacare, America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans submits a friend of the court brief (pdf) that paints a medically apocalyptic picture should the Affordable Care Act collapse. Referencing Massachusetts\u2019 example as the birthplace of then-Gov. Mitt Romney\u2019s model that inspired the ACA, AHIP and others note that \u201cfor every 830 adults gaining insurance coverage there was one fewer death per year,\u201d adding, \u201c[nationally,] 8.2 million people can be expected to lose health insurance in the absence of subsidies on the federal marketplace \u2026 [which] equates to over 9,800 additional Americans dying each year.\u201d\n\nSo far, 9.5 million people have enrolled in the health care exchanges, a number that\u2019s fast making Obamacare too big to fail. That means if conservatives are successful, quite a few people of color will be on their own, including African Americans and Latinos who have seen their uninsured rates drop significantly by 8 and 10 percent, respectively, as a result of the ACA (though the drop could be even steeper for black folks if certain GOP-held states would accept Medicaid expansion).\n\nWe turned to a few noted health care policy experts for The Take on exactly what happens if the Affordable Care Act as we know it disappears \u2026 and who would suffer in the process.\n\nDr. Maya Rockeymoore, Center for Global Policy Solutions: At the end of the day, Obamacare has been responsible for [almost] 10 million people receiving health care coverage, many of whom represent particularly vulnerable populations\u2014Latino, African American, low-income.\n\nMany Americans will face real consequences: Fewer people will seek important preventive care, serious medical issues will go untreated and many families will be financially devastated by sky-high medical bills. Those shrugging their shoulders about the thousands who would likely die an early death or struggle with untreated conditions if Obamacare is repealed\u2014and not replaced with an equivalent or better system\u2014fail to consider the steep economic toll this would take on government and industry in the form of greater uncompensated care, lost productivity, and higher incidences of preventable and expensive chronic diseases.\n\nDr. Ellen Shaffer, EQUAL Health Network: With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, we\u2019ve witnessed premiums stabilize, and that leads to more healthy people. So in the event this law is repealed or drawn down, 99 percent of those who would otherwise face burdensome or cost-prohibitive premiums if the ACA were not in place will suddenly be back in the same situation. There will be a substantial increase in premiums for 31 percent of single-income households and more than 50 percent of family-income households.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/462708786-president-barack-obama-speaks-during-a-meeting-with.jpg?w=50", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theRoot", "site_name": "The Root", "description": "The experts weigh in on the consequences for those who would lose coverage.", "title": "Who Gets Hurt if the ACA Gets Repealed?", "url": "http://www.theroot.com/blog/who_gets_hurt_if_the_aca_gets_repealed", "image": "http://www.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/462708786-president-barack-obama-speaks-during-a-meeting-with.jpg", "type": "article"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-02-07 03:00:17", "sailthru.title": "Who Gets Hurt if the ACA Gets Repealed?", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 110960888944481}, "sailthru.description": "<p>A lot of smart people have accumulated quite a bit of data showing how many people, and who specifically, have benefited from the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare.</p>", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/462708786-president-barack-obama-speaks-during-a-meeting-with.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "We turned to a few noted health care policy experts for The Take on exactly what happens if the Affordable Care Act as we know it disappears \u2026 and who would suffer in the process.\nDr. Ellen Shaffer, EQUAL Health Network: With the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, we\u2019ve witnessed premiums stabilize, and that leads to more healthy people.\nFast-forward to today, and we find the ACA becoming something of a boon for insurance companies and hospitals.\nBut new questions abound about how many people could be hurt if the law were suddenly stripped away.\nA lot of smart people have accumulated quite a bit of data showing how many people, and who specifically, have benefited from the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare."}
