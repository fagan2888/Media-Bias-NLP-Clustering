ST. LOUIS — Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger has been carted off after injuring his left knee on a sack in the third quarter against the St. Louis Rams.

The team said he would not return.

Michael Vick made his first appearance of the season late in the third, making a short completion on third down before the Steelers punted.

Safety Mark Barron tripped up Roethlisberger by getting a hand on his leg.

Roethlisberger was 20 for 24 for 192 yards and an interception.

Roethlisberger hasn’t missed a game since 2012 when he was out for three games late in the season because of a shoulder injury.
