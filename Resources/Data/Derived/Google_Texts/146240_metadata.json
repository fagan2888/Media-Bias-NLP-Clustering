They spent the day learning their way around the Capitol, attending a welcome reception and gathering first impressions of fellow members and leaders.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA bright-eyed Rep.-elect Ryan Costello (R-Pa.) hadn\u2019t even gotten his bearings, when reporters pelted him with questions in front of the hotel. He rose early Wednesday morning at his home in West Chester, played with his 11-month-old son, caught a train from Wilmington, Del., to D.C., dropped his bags off at the hotel, then stepped before a bank of TV cameras.\n\nCostello, a county commissioner, said he\u2019s most interested to meet fellow Pennsylvania freshman Brendan Boyle, a Democrat in a neighboring district.\n\n\u201cIn my role as county commissioner, I take pride in working with the other side,\u201d said Costello, 38. \u201cObviously, we have principles where you can\u2019t come to agreement on something \u2014 that\u2019s one thing. But I do think new members should be focused on areas where we can find agreement and where we can move this country forward.\u201d\n\nWhile most of the soon-to-be members of Congress will have two months to prepare to take office in January, three hit the ground running Wednesday evening. Reps. Dave Brat (R-Va.), Alma Adams (D-N.C.) and Donald Norcross (D-N.J.) were sworn in during the first House votes of the lame-duck session to fill vacancies.\n\nThe three lawmakers still have to finish hiring staff and acclimate to Capitol Hill, even as they\u2019re already on the job.\n\nAdams, for instance, will only get to enjoy the plum office space of her predecessor, now-Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mel Watt (D), with its spectacular views of the Capitol for a few weeks, until a more senior colleague wins the space in the office lottery next Wednesday.\n\nThe need to serve out the remainder of Watt\u2019s term meant Adams didn\u2019t have much time to get ready to become a member of Congress eight days after winning the special and general elections.\n\n\u201cI had to speed up my packing and all those other kinds of things the other members have a little more time to do,\u201d Adams said.\n\nThere were also other symbolic gestures of passing the torch. Retiring longtime Rep. Howard Coble (R-N.C.), sporting a cap and plaid sports coat, was spotted dropping off his successor, ordained minister and fellow Republican Mark Walker, at the hotel.\n\nWalker told reporters he\u2019s not ready to endorse the slate of House GOP leaders yet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re willing to get behind whoever comes out of there, but we want to make sure that\u2019s the best choice and the best representation,\u201d Walker said.\n\nApart from freshman orientation, events scheduled for this week and next, members are also scoping out places to live while they\u2019re in Washington.\n\nRep.-elect Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), who was disembarking from his car after a three-and-a-half-hour drive from New Jersey, said his wife and nephew would be looking at potential homes away from home over the next week.\n\nAt least two members-elect didn\u2019t rule out living in their offices. Rep.-elect Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) said he would stay with a friend in the D.C. area to start.\n\n\u201cI think there might be some couch surfing in my immediate future,\u201d Moulton laughed.\n\nRep.-elect Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) was also on the fence about potentially living in his office when he\u2019s in Washington, given the high cost of living.\n\n\u201cI still have sticker shock. It\u2019s a little more expensive than in northwest Georgia,\u201d Loudermilk joked.\n\nIncoming members are also using the next several weeks to hire office staffers when their terms start in January.\n\n\u201cDozens of resumes were flowing in, basically as the results were coming in, so we need to make sure we\u2019re hiring the best possible staff to be able to represent our district,\u201d said Rep.-elect Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.), who ousted Democratic Rep. Tim Bishop Tim BishopFlint residents hire first K Street firm House moves to vote on .1T package; backup plan in place GOP wants accountability, innovation from accreditation \u2013 at least right now MORE from his Long Island seat.\n\nOther freshmen have already gone through this experience before. Rep.-elect Frank Guinta (R-N.H.), who served one term in the House from 2011-2013, said he\u2019d already doled out advice to the newcomers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to a few of the incoming freshmen, and I\u2019ve said, \u2018Enjoy this time during orientation. Don\u2019t make too many promises. Make sure you listen and learn.\u2019 And I\u2019ve offered my experience if they need some help,\u201d Guinta said.\n\nThe New Hampshire Republican said he felt more prepared to take office after having already served a term in Congress.\n\n\u201cYou kind of know what the pitfalls are, what the challenges are,\u201d Guinta said.\n\nOther freshmen who\u2019ve been around Capitol Hill for years insist they\u2019ve still got lots to learn. Rep.-elect Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) will replace her husband, Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), the longest-serving member of Congress in history, who is retiring after 60 years in the House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got to learn how to run an office,\u201d Dingell said. \u201cI\u2019m just another freshman learning the rules.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Wednesday was the congressional equivalent of first day of school for 60 House freshmen.", "description": "Wednesday was the congressional equivalent of first day of school for 60 House freshmen.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Cristina Marcos and Scott Wong", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Wednesday was the congressional equivalent of first day of school for 60 House freshmen.", "title": "Freshmen get taste of Capitol Hill life", "url": "http://thehill.com/homenews/house/223964-freshmen-get-taste-of-capitol-hill-life", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/lovemia_111214gn.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T05:09-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/homenews/house/223964-freshmen-get-taste-of-capitol-hill-life", "dcterms.date": "2014-11-12T19:33-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Rachel Huggins", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Tim Bishop,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-12T19:33:46-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T05:09:48-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/homenews/house/223964-freshmen-get-taste-of-capitol-hill-life", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Wednesday was the congressional equivalent of first day of school for 60 House freshmen.", "card": "summary", "title": "Freshmen get taste of Capitol Hill life"}, "dcterms.title": "Freshmen get taste of Capitol Hill life"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd65b0\"", "article_summary": "Wednesday was the congressional equivalent of the first day of school for 60 incoming House freshmen, as they juggled hiring decisions, housing searches and newfound fame.\nOther freshmen who\u2019ve been around Capitol Hill for years insist they\u2019ve still got lots to learn.\nMembers-elect, their families and staff checked into the Capitol Hill Hotel for the weeklong freshman orientation, many lugging giant suitcases.\nThe three lawmakers still have to finish hiring staff and acclimate to Capitol Hill, even as they\u2019re already on the job.\nThey spent the day learning their way around the Capitol, attending a welcome reception and gathering first impressions of fellow members and leaders."}
