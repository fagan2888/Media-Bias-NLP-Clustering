The agency told the drugs\u2019 manufacturers to confirm their effectiveness or withdraw them from the market.\n\nThe FDA also is looking into findings by a researcher at Boston\u2019s Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital that generic versions of Pfizer\u2019s cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor manufactured outside of the U.S. contains impurities that inhibit the drug's therapeutic effect.\n\nThe FDA said that, as a number of popular drugs come off patent through 2015, it lacks the resources to independently police generics.\n\n\u201cFDA is aware that there are reports noting that some people may experience an undesired effect when switching from a brand-name drug to a generic formulation or from one generic drug to another generic drug,\u201d the agency states on its website. The FDA \u201cis encouraging the generic industry to investigate whether, and under what circumstances, such problems occur.\u201d\n\nThe website adds, \u201cThe agency does not have the resources to perform independent clinical studies and lacks the regulatory authority to require industry to conduct such studies.\"\n\nThe FDA\u2019s lack of resources worries some policymakers and researchers. The most recent statistics show the agency approved 154 new generic drugs in the first five months of fiscal year 2015. It approved 409 new generic drugs in fiscal year 2014.\n\n\u201cThe FDA is grossly underfunded and needs greater investments in order to ensure consumer safety,\u201d said U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, who represents the 3rd Congressional District and is a former chairwoman of the agriculture appropriations subcommittee, which funds the FDA.\n\nBrigham and Women\u2019s researcher R. Preston Mason said that generic drugs \u201cmay suffer from poor quality or may not be as beneficial for patients\u201d as the brand-name drugs.\n\nMore than eight in 10 prescriptions in the U.S. are filled using generic drugs, which provide cost savings over brand-name products. The Affordable Care Act, enacted in 2010, gives consumers more access to generic drugs, and the FDA in March approved its first generic biologic drug\u2014a product from a living organism.\n\nFDA Testing And Oversight\n\nThe agency has fielded criticism about its lack of testing of generics and quality-control problems among manufacturers in India. Bloomberg News disclosed last year that the FDA had launched a $20 million program to increase testing of generic drugs\u201410 times the amount of money it previously had available. That program came after the agency cited quality-control problems, fraud and manufacturing violations at facilities in India, where about 40 percent of America\u2019s generic and over-the-counter drugs are manufactured.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General recently released a 2015 \u201cwork plan\u201d that includes a planned review of how often the FDA inspects generic drug manufacturers and the enforcement actions taken when deficiencies are found.\n\nDespite the concerns about adequate oversight, FDA officials and some consumer advocates say Americans should feel safe using generic drugs and confident about their effectiveness.\n\n\u201cThe FDA goes to great lengths to ensure that the brand and generic drugs perform as expected,\u201d said FDA spokeswoman Sandy Walsh. All generic drugs approved by the agency \u201chave the same high quality, strength, purity and stability as brand-name drugs.\u201d Manufacturing, packaging and testing sites for generic drugs must pass the same quality standards as those for brand-name drugs, she said.\n\nAccording to the FDA, a generic drug is identical\u2014or bioequivalent\u2014to a brand-name drug \u201cin dosage form, safety, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use.\u201d\n\nDr. Michael Carome, director of the nonprofit Public Citizen\u2019s Health Research Group, said the FDA\u2019s standards and process for approving generic drugs \u201care appropriate for ensuring their safety and effectiveness.\u201d He said consumers should ask for generic drugs because they are cheaper than brand-name products.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, generic drugs save consumers an estimated $8 billion to $10 billion annually at retail pharmacies.\n\n\u201cIf you look at drug recalls for various quality problems,\u201d Carome said, \u201cthe number of recalls for brand-name drugs occurs at a similar, if not greater rate, compared to generic drugs.\u201d\n\nGeneric vs. Brand-Name Drugs\n\n\u201cSwitching to an approved generic has resulted in severe problems for some patients,\u201d and the risks of switching between different generics are not well understood, Mason said. \u201cIn principle, it is quite possible for two generic drugs to be equivalent to the innovator, but not to each other.\u201d\n\nSubstituting generic drugs for brand-name products \u201cis of great concern to health care providers, principally because the development of generic products no longer requires extensive trials in patients,\u201d Mason said. Bioequivalency standards \u201conly require the generic drug to show bioequivalence with the brand-name drug in normal and healthy subjects, and not in the target patient population.\u201d\n\nJoe Graedon, who provides consumer information on The People\u2019s Pharmacy website, said he was an \u201centhusiastic\u201d booster of generic drugs for more than 25 years, until he received many complaints from patients. He criticizes the FDA for not sharing with doctors, pharmacists and patients the bioequivalence data that generic drug makers are required to show to prove their products are absorbed into the blood stream at the same rate as the original brand-name medicines.\n\nLast November, the agency expressed its concern about the bioequivalence of two approved generic versions of Concerta manufactured by Kudco Ireland and Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals. The Kudco name is no longer used by Kremers Urban Pharmaceuticals, which now manufactures one of the generics.\n\nOn June 8, UCB, the Belgium-based parent company of Kremers Urban, announced that Kremers Urban has submitted to the FDA final results of new bioequivalence studies and requested a meeting with the agency. Kremers Urban \u201cplans to continue making its product available to patients,\u201d UCB said.\n\nMallinckrodt spokeswoman Rhonda Sciarra said the company\u2019s generic products \u201care safe and effective\u201d and \u201chave consistently met all quality specifications and the regulatory requirements originally defined by the FDA.\u201d Mallinckrodt \u201chas continued to engage with the FDA regarding a scientific evaluation of these issues,\u201d Sciarra said.\n\nProblems with the generic versions of Wellbutrin and Toprol XL also have been reported.\n\nIn 2013, the FDA announced that a generic version of Wellbutrin XL 300 mg, a popular antidepressant manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, had been found not to be bioequivalent to the drug and would be pulled off the market. Walsh said some versions of the 300 mg strength were not initially tested in healthy volunteers due to the possible risk of seizures.\n\nThe FDA\u2019s Walsh said the agency\u2019s approach to the generic Wellbutrin issue was overly cautious.\n\nOhio-based cardiologist Dr. Harry Lever, who works at the Cleveland Clinic, brought concerns about the generic version of the heart drug Toprol XL to the FDA in 2012. Last year, two large Indian manufacturers announced recalls of the drug. The FDA also banned imports from a generics manufacturer in India, Ranbaxy Laboratories, in the past few years.\n\nLever and Graedon say the FDA doesn\u2019t have adequate resources and enough inspectors to oversee generic drug manufacturers abroad, particularly in India and China.\n\nDr. Aaron Kesselheim, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said the FDA \u201cneeds more resources to oversee drugs made overseas in India and elsewhere.\u201d He adds, however, that there is no evidence that drugs made in India \u201care poor quality or unsafe across the board, or any evidence of subpar quality generic drugs being available to any measurable extent in the U.S.\u201d\n\nFDA spokesman Chris Kelly said there are 526 drug-manufacturing facilities registered with the FDA in India, and 10 FDA drug investigators there. In China, there are 517 facilities registered with the FDA. The agency had three drug inspectors there in November and plans to increase the number to 13, Kelly said.\n\nThe FDA also sends U.S.-based staff and inspectors on short-term trips \u201cto ensure the safety of FDA-regulated products,\u201d he said.\n\nDinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy director and whistleblower who reported the company\u2019s falsification of data, said the 2012 Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act has given the FDA \u201cadditional tools and resources to more closely monitor the production processes\u201d at foreign facilities. The act expanded the FDA\u2019s authority to ensure the safety, effectiveness and quality of imported drugs.\n\n\u201cThe question now is how\u2014and whether\u2014these facilities will address these lapses, fix their problems and produce good-quality products,\u201d Thakur said. \u201cI am not so sure that they have the intent and the capability to do so.\u201d\n\nThis story was reported under a partnership with the Connecticut Health I-Team (c-hit.org).", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "As the federal government advocates increased use of generic drugs, concerns are mounting about the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s oversight and the", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/can-fda-adequately-police-generics", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201507/8116279888_60794f6e83_k_0.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "As the federal government advocates increased use of generic drugs, concerns are mounting about the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s oversight and the", "title": "Can the FDA Adequately Police Generics?"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Gary Stoller", "wordCount": 1661, "dc": {"title": "Can the FDA Adequately Police Generics?"}, "nid": 43576, "datePublished": "2015-07-13", "story_id": 422533436, "keywords": "The Daily, drugs, government, medicine", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba53\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe FDA goes to great lengths to ensure that the brand and generic drugs perform as expected,\u201d said FDA spokeswoman Sandy Walsh.\nThe FDA said that, as a number of popular drugs come off patent through 2015, it lacks the resources to independently police generics.\nFDA Testing And OversightThe agency has fielded criticism about its lack of testing of generics and quality-control problems among manufacturers in India.\nThe most recent statistics show the agency approved 154 new generic drugs in the first five months of fiscal year 2015.\nThe FDA also banned imports from a generics manufacturer in India, Ranbaxy Laboratories, in the past few years."}
