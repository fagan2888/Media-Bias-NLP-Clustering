That estimated cost didn\u2019t account for eventual demolition, raising the total price-tag to about $48 million, said Terry Miller with Cordell Corporation, which is guiding the development for the agency.\n\nThe agency bought the Riviera for $182.5 million plus $8.5 million in transaction costs in February.\n\nRoss also suggested that demolishing the structure sooner rather than later might also inspire something to happen at another nearby structure, the Fountainebleau, that has sat nearly built but never finished or occupied next door on the Las Vegas Strip since 2007.\n\nThe committee voted at the same meeting to recommend ditching the \u201cglobal business district\u201d name to refer to the $2.3 billion project and instead call it the Las Vegas Convention Center District.\n\n___\n\nThe story has been corrected to reflect that the name of the tourism agency is the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority not the Las Vegas Convention and Tourism Authority.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Riviera casino-hotel will come tumbling down but at an expected cost of $42 million and not for at least six months if a recommendation to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority is approved.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Riviera casino-hotel will come tumbling down but at an expected cost of $42 million and not for at least six months if a recommendation to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority is approved.", "title": "Riviera casino demolition at least 6 months away, cost $42M", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/28/riviera-casino-demolition-at-least-6-months-away-c/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/28/ab59a87fa6c183217d0f6a706700fae0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/28/ab59a87fa6c183217d0f6a706700fae0.jpg", "description": "The Riviera casino-hotel will come tumbling down but at an expected cost of $42 million and not for at least six months if a recommendation to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority is approv", "card": "summary", "title": "Riviera casino demolition at least 6 months away, cost $42M"}, "Author": "KIMBERLY PIERCEALL", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "___The story has been corrected to reflect that the name of the tourism agency is the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority not the Las Vegas Convention and Tourism Authority.\nLas Vegas Councilman Steve Ross recommended a worldwide raffle with the winner pushing the button to implode the casino-hotel.\nThe Las Vegas Global Business District Committee\u2019s six members voted unanimously Tuesday in favor of the option.\nLAS VEGAS (AP) - The Riviera casino-hotel will come tumbling down but at an expected cost of $42 million and not for at least six months if a recommendation to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority is approved.\nThe demolition discussion included talks of how to mark the occasion, when it comes, of turning the Riviera into rubble."}
