Find a place within reasonable distance of Brooklyn where the land is cheap and underdeveloped.\n\nStep 2. Buy as much property as you can in your target area \u2013 if possible, without tipping off locals that you plan to turn it into a Hasidic enclave.\n\nStep 3. Ensure the zoning is suited to Hasidic living: densely clustered homes big enough for large families and within walking distance of the community\u2019s vital infrastructure.\n\nStep 4. Build the infrastructure: Houses, a synagogue and beit midrash study hall, kosher establishments, a mikvah ritual bath. Lay the groundwork for a school. Launch a shuttle service so Hasidim who don\u2019t drive or don\u2019t own cars can get from the new shtetl to shopping outlets and other Hasidic communities in the region.\n\nStep 5. Market to the Hasidic community and turn on the lights.\n\nThat, essentially, is the playbook developer Shalom Lamm is following for what is shaping up to be America\u2019s newest Hasidic shtetl \u2014 the town of Bloomingburg in upstate New York.\n\nLocated in Sullivan County about 80 miles north of Brooklyn, Bloomingburg is a tiny village of 400 people dotted with small farms, run-down homes and a couple of old churches. There\u2019s just one stoplight, and there\u2019s not much to the small businesses clustered around it: a hardware store, bank, tattoo parlor, barbershop and thrift shop.\n\nThis is the way things were for decades until Lamm \u2014 son of Rabbi Norman Lamm, Yeshiva University\u2019s president from 1976 to 2003 \u2014 came to town a few years ago and started snapping up properties like they were sample-sale sweaters.\n\nHe bought the white house with blue shutters and a front porch just across from the barbershop. He bought the Hickory apartments just off Main Street, adjacent to a trailer park. He bought the hardware store and a pizza shop. He bought a large warehouse built to house antique cars with the idea of turning it into a girls school.\n\nLamm didn\u2019t stop there. He bought a group of farms on 200 acres of unincorporated land about half a mile from the stoplight and in 2006 got the village to annex it and rezone it for residential development in exchange for building a new $5 million sewage treatment plant for the area. He bought the airport in the nearby village of Wurtsboro. He bought 635 acres five miles away. He also bought a house for himself in Bloomingburg and moved in (Lamm also lives in West Hempstead, on Long Island).\n\nSoon, changes started happening in the village.\n\nHomes were fixed up and repainted. The Hickory apartments, originally built as a senior housing development, were renovated and turned into 12 units, with a synagogue and study hall built in a basement. Most notably, in 2012 rows of attached five-bedroom townhomes began going up on the 200 acres he had gotten rezoned from agricultural \u2014 the first of at least 396 units planned for construction in a development Lamm dubbed Chestnut Ridge.\n\nMeanwhile in Brooklyn, a two-hour drive away, Yiddish-language newspapers began to run advertisements touting a new Hasidic housing development going up in Bloomingburg. The ads noted its location near the Catskill Mountains and just 30 minutes north of the Satmar village of Kiryas Joel, home to more than 20,000 Hasidim.\n\nOnce the locals upstate caught onto what was happening \u2014 when Chestnut Ridge broke ground in 2012 \u2014 opposition materialized almost immediately. Village meetings were organized, accusations flew, angry protesters took to the streets and lawsuits were filed. The Town of Mamakating (pop. 12,000), in which the village of Bloomingburg is located, tried to annex the village so that it could gain zoning power over Bloomingburg and thwart the Hasidic-friendly construction, but the bid failed.\n\nLamm and his defenders, including the public relations consultant he eventually hired, cast their opponents as anti-Semites or anti-Hasidic, and for some that characterization seemed apt. The window of the kosher grocery was repeatedly shattered, and some early protests outside Shabbat prayer services included anti-Jewish epithets.\n\nBut for many locals, it was a case of not-in-my-backyard syndrome: They lived in a quiet, albeit poor, country village, and the dense housing and Hasidic influx would indelibly alter Bloomingburg\u2019s character. They believed Lamm and his investment partner, Kenneth Nakdimen, had hoodwinked the village into annexing and rezoning the agricultural land he was turning into a dense residential development.\n\nLast month, Mamakating and Bloomingburg filed a federal lawsuit against Lamm, accusing him of fraud, bribery, racketeering, voter fraud and corruption of public officials \u2014 saying he bribed a former mayor, used a frontman to help mislead the village about his intentions for Chestnut Ridge and engaged in racketeering by promoting an enterprise that was corrupt on multiple levels. Lamm denies the accusations and has filed lawsuits of his own against the town.\n\nIf Bloomingburg was going to look like any of the other Hasidic communities north of New York City \u2013 New Square, Kiryas Joel, or the hamlet of Monsey in Ramapo \u2013 there were plenty of cautionary tales to give local residents pause. Overcrowding in those places was taxing local infrastructure to the breaking point, and in Ramapo the school board had been taken over by a Hasidic majority that was stripping local public school budgets and selling off public school buildings to yeshivas at cut-rate prices.\n\nFor the Hasidim, the appeal of Bloomingburg over Brooklyn was clear. It offered much cheaper living, less congestion and fewer of the sorts of urban temptations that could ensnare a devout Jew. With so few residents, the village also offered the prospect of something else: political power that could give local Hasidim nearly unfettered control over their own destiny.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the first Hasidic families began to arrive.\n\nSome were older couples from points south looking for a quiet place near the mountains in which to spend summers or weekends. But soon full-timers started coming, too \u2014 mostly young families from Satmar and other Hungarian Hasidic sects looking for more affordable alternatives to Brooklyn\u2019s Williamsburg neighborhood and a quieter lifestyle than that available in Kiryas Joel or in Monsey, the sprawling Orthodox stronghold in Rockland County an hour to the south.\n\nBloomingburg\u2019s first Hasidic pioneers arrived with almost no Orthodox infrastructure in place. There wasn\u2019t much suitable food available locally \u2014 one early newcomer quipped that the only produce available at the local grocery store was two-week-old tomatoes \u2014 and kosher food had to be delivered by special order from Kiryas Joel or nearby Middletown. There was no weekday minyan. There was no women\u2019s mikvah (and still isn\u2019t \u2014 the zoning appeals board has rejected Lamm\u2019s site for one).\n\nThen, last summer, the city got its first kollel \u2013 a Jewish study collective where men learn Torah full time and receive stipends in return from community supporters (in this case, apparently, Lamm). Lamm also bought a 22-seat minibus and a passenger van and began running shuttles to large shopping areas and to Kiryas Joel, where some of Bloomingburg\u2019s adults work and kids go to school.\n\nBy fall, there were enough Orthodox families in Bloomingburg to support a daily minyan \u2014 the quorum of 10 men needed for public prayer. Weekday services start at 9 a.m.\n\nMendel Kritzler, 25, moved to Bloomingburg in mid-April with his wife and three boys from a fourth-floor walkup in Williamsburg. Now he lives in a ground-floor apartment within walking distance of everything he needs: the shul and study hall where he spends his days, the kosher grocery Lamm opened up right before Passover, and the new Hasidic day care that now has 10 kids enrolled between the ages of 3 and 4. He doesn\u2019t own a car.\n\n\u201cI was a little nervous before coming here, but since I moved I\u2019ve really been enjoying it; it\u2019s the Garden of Eden,\u201d Kritzler said. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet. There\u2019s peace of mind. It\u2019s much, much cheaper \u2013 half the price of Williamsburg.\u201d\n\nLamm\u2019s rentals begin at $350 per month for small one-bedrooms to $1,200 for large three-bedrooms. One of his tenants noted that, unlike her landlord in Monsey, Lamm isn\u2019t so strict about the rent.\n\nAt the now-fully occupied Hickory apartments, young Hasidic women gather in the late afternoons and sit on plastic lawn chairs, rocking infants in their laps and watching their toddlers run around while they chitchat in the springtime sun. Once a month, the Hasidic women in town get together in someone\u2019s house or the local kosher pizza-and-sandwich shop for an evening devoted to bonding, noshing and spiritual inspiration. A recent gathering featured slides on the Jewish value of modesty.\n\nThe men studying at the kollel come home in the early afternoon for a break. Some walk up the hill to the small kosher grocery, where the shelves are well stocked but the aisles mostly empty of customers. Those who commute to work in Kiryas Joel are generally home by early evening. Despite the sleepy feel in town, there\u2019s a sense of excitement among the Hasidim \u2013 a feeling that they\u2019re the trailblazers in a noble experiment of establishing a new outpost for Hasidic life in New York State.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the pioneer, really,\u201d said a young Belgian-born Hasid named Yossele who said his was the second full-time family to move in.\n\nSo far, only 27 Hasidic families live full time in the village, according to Yechiel Falkowitz, a 22-year-old Hasid who moved in last summer and compiled a head count of the families in early May. Another 20 or so families live part time in Bloomingburg, he said. Lamm, who is the landlord of all but a handful of the Hasidic families\u2019 homes, says there are 176 Orthodox Jewish residents in Bloomingburg, comprising 40-50 families.\n\n(The true Hasidic population of Bloomingburg is the subject of a legal dispute. Over the winter, the county board of elections challenged the eligibility of more than 150 individuals, almost all of them Hasidim, to vote in local elections, and said it would remove them from voter rolls. Hasidim responded with a civil rights lawsuit against the board.)\n\nThe main obstacle to growth at present is the town of Mamakating and the village\u2019s government, which has declined to grant certificates of occupancy for the 51 townhouses at Chestnut Ridge that have been move-in ready for months, according to Lamm. Without those certificates, Lamm can\u2019t close the sales of the homes.\n\n\u201cAlmost nothing gets permitted,\u201d Lamm told JTA. \u201cI get the sense that they\u2019d like us to give up, but that\u2019s not in the cards.\u201d\n\nLawyers for Mamakating and Bloomingburg say modifications are needed to bring the homes up to code first and that the process for evaluating the homes and granting certificates of occupancy is underway.\n\nIf Lamm\u2019s vision comes to fruition, there soon will be hundreds more Hasidic families in Bloomingburg \u2013 maybe thousands.\n\nAt Chestnut Ridge, the newly built 2,800-square-foot attached townhomes look like they\u2019re straight out of a brochure for the American dream, with identical facades, fresh white garages and bright green lawns. Inside, the d\u00e9cor is bright, modern and spacious, with 9-foot ceilings, an upstairs laundry room, and kitchens with granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances.\n\nThe houses also have all the accoutrements Hasidim, with their large families and Orthodox practices, might desire. The kitchens feature two stoves, sinks, ovens and microwaves \u2013 one each for dairy and meat. There\u2019s an outdoor sukkah deck just off the dining room. Special sinks are located outside the bathrooms for ritual hand-washing, and a small room near the front is designed for a miniature library or study.\n\nThe five bedrooms upstairs have sleeping space for up to a dozen. The master bathroom easily fits two full-sized beds \u2013 Hasidic couples do not share beds during women\u2019s menstrual periods and for a week afterward \u2013 and the walk-in closet in the master bedroom is big enough for a crib, which Lamm doesn\u2019t doubt Hasidic parents will notice when their babies are born.\n\nThe homes are priced between $299,000 and $334,000. Once the remaining 350 or so houses are built, there will also be four playgrounds for the kids.\n\nMany longtime Bloomingburg residents say they\u2019re taking a wait-and-see approach even as they\u2019re still stinging from the way Lamm got his housing development approved. They blame Bloomingburg\u2019s former mayor for agreeing to the deal and say the village population was told the site was going to be a golf course surrounded by luxury homes, not dense development suited to Hasidim.\n\n\u201cIt was a shady deal. The politicians we had here threw us under the bus,\u201d said Patti, the owner of a thrift shop in the village who, like all the locals interviewed for this story and many of the Hasidim, asked that her last name not be used. After so much conflict and bad press, people here are wary of reporters.\n\nPatti lives across from the Chestnut Ridge development, which she said has dramatically altered the local landscape. \u201cI used to look at farm fields every day, with silos and animals grazing,\u201d she said. Now she looks out at Lamm\u2019s townhouses.\n\nDespite her misgivings, Patti says she\u2019s reserving judgment about what\u2019s to come.\n\n\u201cThings are definitely going to change. Whether it\u2019ll be for the better or worse it\u2019s too soon to tell,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s in limbo right now.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.128x79":
