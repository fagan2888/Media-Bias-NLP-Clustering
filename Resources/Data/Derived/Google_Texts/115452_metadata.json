The only problem is that the president seems to have an exceptionally hard time getting there. In fact, planned Obama trips to Indonesia tends to be pretty good indicators that a major domestic political crisis is imminent.\n\nIn March 2010, Obama postponed a trip to Indonesia and Australia for a few days, and then for a few months during the final push for passage of the Affordable Care Act. That June he postponed it again during the BP oil spill. When he did finally make it to Indonesia in November, he had to cut his trip short because of fears of ash from the eruption of Mount Merapi.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nA November 2011 trip to the ASEAN Summit in Bali was less eventful, but now it seems the Indonesia curse has struck again, with Obama canceling plans to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bali and the ASEAN summit in Brunei next week, due to the government shutdown. Planned stops in Malaysia and the Philippines were canceled earlier this week.\n\nJoking aside, Obama\u2019s difficulty in finding time to visit Indonesia highlights one of the problems with the administration\u2019s stated plan to shift the focus of U.S. foreign policy from the Middle East to Asia\u2014the so-called pivot. The White House clearly cares about deepening economic relationships in Asia\u2014negotiations over the planned Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement will dominate the Bali talks, where the U.S. will now be represented by Secretary of State John Kerry\u2014as well as countering growing Chinese influence in the region.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Barack Obama Has Had a Really Hard Time Trying to Visit Indonesia", "sailthru.author": "Joshua Keating", "description": "Given its growing economy, increasing regional clout, and President Obama\u2019s personal connections to the country, Indonesia might have seemed like an id ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "Given its growing economy, increasing regional clout, and President Obama\u2019s personal connections to the country, Indonesia might have seemed like an id ...", "title": "Barack Obama Has Had a Really Hard Time Trying to Visit Indonesia", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2013/10/04/obama_cancels_asia_trip_the_president_s_difficulties_in_traveling_to_indonesia.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_world_/2013/10/04/obama_cancels_asia_trip_the_president_s_difficulties_in_traveling_to_indonesia/94240223.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Given its growing economy, increasing regional clout, and President Obama\u2019s personal connections to the country, Indonesia might have seemed like an id ...", "title": "Barack Obama Has Had a Really Hard Time Trying to Visit Indonesia", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2013/10/04/obama_cancels_asia_trip_the_president_s_difficulties_in_traveling_to_indonesia.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_world_/2013/10/04/obama_cancels_asia_trip_the_president_s_difficulties_in_traveling_to_indonesia/94240223.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@joshuakeating", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-04T13:12:21Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "Barack Obama Has Had a Really Hard Time Trying to Visit Indonesia", "sailthru.headline": "The Six Most Terrifying Words in American Politics: The President Is Going to Indonesia", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"Barack Obama Has Had a Really Hard Time Trying to Visit Indonesia\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2013/10/04/obama_cancels_asia_trip_the_president_s_difficulties_in_traveling_to_indonesia.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_world_/2013/10/04/obama_cancels_asia_trip_the_president_s_difficulties_in_traveling_to_indonesia/94240223.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"236131004001\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-04T13:12:21Z\",\n  \"section\": \"News and Politics\",\n  \"author\": \"Joshua Keating\",\n  \"tags\": [\n    \"foreign policy\",\n    \"barack obama\",\n    \"asia\",\n    \"Indonesia\",\n    \"government shutdown\"\n  ]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "Barack Obama Has Had a Really Hard Time Trying to Visit Indonesia", "keywords": "Obama cancels Asia trip, obama cancels indoenesia trip, government shutdown asia trip, government shutdown china,", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "Obama cancels Asia trip, obama cancels indoenesia trip, government shutdown asia trip, government shutdown china,", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "sailthru.description": "Given its growing economy, increasing regional clout, and President Obama\u2019s personal connections to the country, Indonesia might have seemed like an id ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/the_world_/2013/10/04/obama_cancels_asia_trip_the_president_s_difficulties_in_traveling_to_indonesia/94240223.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd31c3\"", "article_summary": "In fact, planned Obama trips to Indonesia tends to be pretty good indicators that a major domestic political crisis is imminent.\nIn March 2010, Obama postponed a trip to Indonesia and Australia for a few days, and then for a few months during the final push for passage of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe only problem is that the president seems to have an exceptionally hard time getting there.\nPhoto by Adek Berry/AFP/Getty ImagesGiven its growing economy, increasing regional clout, and President Obama\u2019s personal connections to the country, Indonesia might have seemed like an ideal target for outreach by the administration.\nWhen he did finally make it to Indonesia in November, he had to cut his trip short because of fears of ash from the eruption of Mount Merapi."}
