But she doesn\u2019t just go after rapists on TV. Hargitay\u2019s efforts to reform the way that law enforcement officials deal with sexual assault are helping convict people who are guilty of rape in real life.\n\nHargitay\u2019s nonprofit organization, the Joyful Heart Foundation, advocates for ending the backlog of untested rape kits across the country. In storage lockers across the United States, an estimated 400,000 kits that contain DNA evidence from sexual assaults are collecting dust. Without that evidence, sexual assault cases often stall. By now, some of these kits are 25 years old, and those rape victims haven\u2019t seen justice served.\n\nSo now, the actress is partnering with leaders in Detroit \u2014 a city that\u2019s working hard to end its own backlog \u2014 to push for a new bill to implement a better process for rape kit pickup, testing, and tracking across Michigan.\n\n\u201cTo me, this is the clearest and most shocking demonstration of how we regard these crimes,\u201d Hargitay said at a press conference in Detroit this week to announce the new legislative initiative. \u201cOne would assume that if someone endures a four- to six-hour invasive examination, that that evidence would be handled with care.\u201d\n\nReporting rates for sexual crimes are already low, but even among the rapes that are reported to the police, only about one out of four leads to an arrest \u2014 and of those arrests, only about one out of four leads to a conviction. Activists like Hargitay point out that\u2019s partly because cities don\u2019t have enough resources to test all of the rape kits they receive. For instance, back in 2009, Detroit law enforcement discovered 11,000 untested rape kits left forgotten in a police warehouse.\n\nWayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy, who was a victim of sexual assault herself when she was in college, has focused her attention on processing all of those kits. So far, police have gotten through about 1,600 of them. At this week\u2019s press conference, Worthy announced that effort has already identified 100 serial rapists \u2014 meaning that DNA was found in at least two different kits, or matched the suspects in other open cases.\n\nOn the same day that Worthy and Hargitay joined forces at their press event, a judge sentenced one of those serial rapists to prison for at least 45 years. In response, one of his victims submitted a statement saying her nightmare is finally over. \u201cAs of today, the Lord has blessed me with some closure, knowing that the person that created this bad dream is going to pay for his actions,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBut there\u2019s still more work to do to get through the rest of the city\u2019s backlog. \u201cI don\u2019t care how long it takes, we\u2019re going to finish,\u201d Worthy said on Monday.\n\nHartigay\u2019s organization has more work to do in other areas of the country, too. There are rape kit backlogs in cities across the United States. President Obama is proposing $35 million in his 2015 fiscal year budget to help address the issue, and Hartigay is currently working on a documentary to continue to raise awareness.\n\nThe character that Hargitay plays on TV actually motivated her to get involved in this work. After she started portraying Detective Olivia Benson, who\u2019s a strong ally to rape survivors on Law & Order, she started getting thousands of letters from real survivors who wanted to tell her their stories. Many of them had never talked to anyone about their sexual assault before, and most of them had been let down by the justice system. Hartigay says that\u2019s what led her to found Joyful Heart in 2004.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Mariska Hargitay is best known for playing a detective on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.
