Considering that she\u2019s the host and star of her own sketch comedy show, this one has a good chance to be a stronger episode than those that have to work around people who aren\u2019t comedy actors, or even actors at all.\n\nOf course, the real question is whether or not \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d can or will even bother to come close to some of the searing satire that Schumer brings to her own show, \u201cInside Amy Schumer.\u201d Like most sketch comedy shows, \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d is hit-or-miss, but when it hits, most frequently on the topic of gender relations, it\u2019s often some of the funniest and most insightful stuff on TV.\n\nAlso now one of the most innovative. The stand-out episode of the season was an episode-long sketch that parodied the \u201960s-era drama \u201c12 Angry Men,\u201d except instead of debating whether a defendant is guilty, the men were debating whether Amy was hot enough to be on basic cable. It really shouldn\u2019t have worked, between the outdated reference and the fact that most sketches are too long at 5 minutes. But somehow it came together to be one of the most memorable moments in Comedy Central\u2019s history, up there with the best \u201cChappelle Show\u201d episodes and some early \u201cSouth Park.\u201d\n\nIt worked for the reason that a lot of Schumer\u2019s best comedy bits about gender and sexism work, because Schumer really gets, and is totally unafraid of targeting, the culture of toxic masculinity. Watching the \u201c12 Angry Men\u201d episode, it quickly becomes apparent that the ostensible topic \u2014 Schumer\u2019s looks \u2014 isn\u2019t really the point of it at all. Instead, Schumer is targeting the way that men talk about women\u2019s bodies as a way to bolster their own egos and try to impress other men. Deigning a woman \u201chot or not\u201d has little to do with actual sexual attraction and everything to do with trying to make other men think of you as studly and powerful, powerful enough to wave away a woman\u2019s body as if you\u2019re a king on a throne, declining gifts from your simpering supplicants.\n\nBut what makes the sketch really next level is that it when it turns, it does so in a humanizing, though still hilarious way. One by one, the men start to crack, admitting in turn that they don\u2019t actually think that Amy is some kind of hideous troll. And while none of them end up coming across as some kind of prince, it cleverly revealed the core of vulnerability and fear that often lays behind this kind of masculine bravado. Months before the #MasculinitySoFragile hashtag took off on Twitter, Schumer had created the masterpiece on the theme.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amy Schumer hosts SNL this weekend, but it will be hard for the show to compete with \"Inside Amy Schumer\"", "title": "Amy Schumer\u2019s \u201cSNL\u201d genius: Tonight\u2019s challenge, topping herself", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Amy Schumer hosts SNL this weekend, but it will be hard for the show to compete with \"Inside Amy Schumer\"", "title": "Amy Schumer\u2019s \u201cSNL\u201d genius: Tonight\u2019s challenge, topping herself", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/10/amy_schumers_snl_genius_tonights_challenge_topping_herself/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/schumer-snl.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Amy Schumer hosts SNL this weekend, but it will be hard for the show to compete with \"Inside Amy Schumer\"", "title": "Amy Schumer\u2019s \u201cSNL\u201d genius: Tonight\u2019s challenge, topping herself", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/schumer-snl.png", "creator": "@AmandaMarcotte", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Amanda Marcotte", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Amy Schumer, Editor's Picks, Inside Amy Schumer, Louis CK, Saturday Night Live, Television, TV", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd33cc\"", "article_summary": "But what makes the sketch really next level is that it when it turns, it does so in a humanizing, though still hilarious way.\nWatching the \u201c12 Angry Men\u201d episode, it quickly becomes apparent that the ostensible topic \u2014 Schumer\u2019s looks \u2014 isn\u2019t really the point of it at all.\nTopics: Amy Schumer, Editor's Picks, Inside Amy Schumer, Louis CK, Saturday Night Live, Television, TV, Media News, Entertainment NewsIt\u2019s been Amy Schumer\u2019s year \u2014 a critically acclaimed comedy show, an Emmy, and a hit movie that helped debunk the myth that no one wants to watch comedies with female leads \u2014 so of course she\u2019s hosting \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d this weekend.\nOne by one, the men start to crack, admitting in turn that they don\u2019t actually think that Amy is some kind of hideous troll.\nInstead, Schumer is targeting the way that men talk about women\u2019s bodies as a way to bolster their own egos and try to impress other men."}
