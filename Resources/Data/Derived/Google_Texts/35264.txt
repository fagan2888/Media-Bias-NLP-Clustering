The next all-new episode of "Criminal Minds" will be intense as the BAU dives into the world of social media in order to track down a killer who targets Internet users who are active and popular on social networks.

In a preview of the upcoming episode, which is aptly titled "Hashtag," a dangerous and social media-savvy killer murders a young attractive girl while she is standing in the mirror. It turns out that the killer stalks his victims' real-time posts on Twitter to find out when they are sleeping before striking.

"The unsub only has to look for the Internet for a seed of potential victims," Spencer says in the teaser video.

In addition, Morgan and Savannah will deal with more trouble in their relationship, notes CarterMatt.

According to the Hollywood Hills, the synopsis reads as follows:

"When victims with large social media followings are found dead in Maryland, the BAU searches for an UnSub taking on the persona of an Internet urban legend. Meanwhile, Morgan and Savannah struggle to find quality time for each other with their busy careers."

During the last episode, "If the Shoe Fits," the BAU tracked down a crazed young woman who targeted affluent attractive guys with dark hair and are in their 20s. The killer, who is identified as Claire, used the lure of sex before brutally killing her victims while they were off guard. She was eventually taken into custody before she killed her another man, reports Entertainment Weekly.

In addition, fans learned more about JJ's backstory and the death of her sister after her mother, Sandy Jareau, played by actress Candy Clark, stopped by.

Season 10, Episode 6 of "Criminal Minds," "Hashtag," will air on Wednesday, Nov. 12, on CBS.
