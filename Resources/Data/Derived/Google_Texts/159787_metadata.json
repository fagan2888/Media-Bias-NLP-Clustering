He does understand the deals that got him into trouble in America in the first place, right?\n\n\u201cOh, come on,\u201d says Webb.\n\nThe idea seems to be that Edelsten is a hapless chap who stumbled into a series of dismal arrangements that began in Las Vegas in 2011, with then-wife Brynne on his arm, and ended with him burning through $27m before declaring himself bankrupt at the start of this year.\n\nThere is something persuasive to the notion that Edelsten is mug.\n\nThe mess he created with his headlong plunge into a series of calamitous deals, buying into distressed properties at the height of America\u2019s post-subprime mortgage crisis, when huge ghetto estates were going cheap, could be characterised as greedy, but in no way smart.\n\n\u201cSquandered\u201d is the term Edelsten used to describe his actions in a US bankruptcy hearing this year. \u201cSplurged.\u201d\n\nThat must be viewed alongside the excoriating comments of American and Australian judges, who have variously characterised Edelsten as an evasive, shifty man who plays cunning shell games with his companies and trusts.\n\nThe issue is not Edelsten\u2019s credibility, which is shot. It is about how he, at 71, maintains a high-octane lifestyle while creditors knock at his door; and how he baffles experienced forensic investigators with his reliably flawed memory.\n\nIt has to be said that Edelsten has tried his best to live an extraordinary life. That is no crime.\n\nHe has made a willing spectacle of himself, but now looks to be scurrying in the opposite direction of old age and the grave, relying on the counter-intuition that god or the devil will fail to notice the shiniest parrot in the tree.\n\nDOCTOR GEOFFREY, THE LADIES\u2019 MAN\n\nIn spectacular satin suits, attached at shoulder-height to Amazon women with high-viz breasts, Edelsten has made a shell game of his life, leaving others to guess what parts of it are real.\n\nBut over in Florida, and here in the Australia, his 30-plus creditors have seen the $50,000 pear-shaped diamond engagement ring he\u2019s given his latest love, Gabi Grecko. They want to know how he paid for it.\n\nIN COURT: Brynne Gordon hears of Geoffrey Edelsten\u2019s financial position\n\nGrecko, 25, is said to be a New York reality TV star, model, DJ and \u201cvamp\u201d \u2014 job descriptions that these days are just as often code for \u201cunderemployed\u201d. She first publicly appeared at Edelsten\u2019s side at AFL legend Tom Hafey\u2019s funeral this year, up-ending the solemnity with a bursting cleavage.\n\nAn attractive and intriguing woman who speaks with just a hint of a Jamaican accent (\u201cMan\u2019attan\u201d), Grecko later apologised \u2014 and seemed genuine enough \u2014 for any offence, saying she did not appreciate Hafey\u2019s significance.\n\nPOPPING THE QUESTION: Geoffrey proposes to Gabi at Melbourne Cup\n\nPerhaps Edelsten did not brief her. As always, his appearance was more important than the event itself. As it was when Edelsten fell to his knees and proposed to Grecko at the Melbourne Cup, making sure the cameras recorded the event: nothing done in private ever as binding as a public consummation.\n\nEdelsten claims he has no income yet, by his own account, burns through around $46,600 a month \u2014 plus the $3000 a week he must pay ex-wife, Brynne, until their family law case is settled.\n\nA US trustee from Florida had been appointed to liquidate his US and Australian assets, and to uncover the extent of any holdings he had left in Australia.\n\nAUSTRALIA ASKS: What are you doing Gabi Grecko?\n\nThe Australian Tax Office has emerged claiming against Edelsten owes it $14,130,000 in outstanding taxes and penalties. It will be lucky to recoup 3c on every dollar.\n\nMost people would dive for the nearest bush, but not Edelsten. He was seen, post-engagement, posing for holiday snaps with Grecko, at Venice Beach, after flying first-class to LA. Grecko gave the camera two middle fingers while he clamped a hand on her left breast, looking like a horrible two-year-old.\n\nHow does he get his money? According to Edelsten, it\u2019s from loans taken out from friends, including $1.6m from his 91-year-old mum, Esther.\n\nHowever, when you file for bankruptcy in the US, you need permission from the court to borrow money. Edelsten, in a repeating pattern of ignoring court orders, received no permission.\n\nYou have to hand it to Edelsten. He doesn\u2019t care what people think. Then again, obviously he cares a great deal. It\u2019s as though wants people to believe he\u2019s getting just a bit more, of everything, than everyone else.\n\nBut this time, he\u2019s out of luck. Edelsten\u2019s recent claims to A Current Affair that he would be left with a \u201ccomfortable\u201d $18m in the wash-up of the bankruptcy proceedings are delusional.\n\nHe\u2019s living on borrowed money he\u2019s not allowed to have. His American adventure has cost him everything.\n\nGEOFFREY EDELSTEN, A BIG SPENDER\n\nEdelsten and Brynne discovered the House of Nurielle boutique in Las Vegas, owned by Miami-based couple Rafael \u201cAlfie\u201d Mawardi and wife Limor, in 2009.\n\nMawardi was a former shoemaker (\u201cNew York\u2019s biggest\u201d) and Limor designed one-off dresses and suits.\n\nTheir target audience was celebrities and the partying rich. By 2011, Edelsten, having millions from the sale of Allied, was back in Vegas and the store, forking out tens of thousands on clothes for Brynne and himself.\n\nThe men and their wives hit it off. Secretly, the Mawardi\u2019s business was in trouble and they were delighted to find Edelsten, who casually mentioned he had $100m at his disposal, anxious to give his underappreciated wife a life-changing distraction.\n\nThe House of Nurielle would be the perfect fit for Brynne, a cocktail waitress Edelsten said he\u2019d met outside a club on Sunset Boulevard. She would become the body and the face of the fashion brand.\n\nTogether, with the Mawardis, they would open stores in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Miami, Singapore, Moscow, Sydney, Melbourne and Hong Kong.\n\nIn July 2011, they signed a joint venture agreement, Edelsten paying $3.2m for half the Mawardi\u2019s fashion company. Stylists were sent in and Brynne modelled in $7000 dresses that were as revealing as a WAG\u2019s post-Brownlow nightie.\n\nThe photos are still there on the Nurielle website, not updated since 2012, when the venture fell in a heap. They\u2019re almost sad. Brynne is beaming as she sees her dreams falling into place.\n\nIn 2011, America\u2019s post-bankruptcy wreckage presented opportunity for the clever and pitfalls for the reckless. Edelsten sent Alfie Mawardi scoping for properties and he came back with two: a huge 670-apartment housing estate in Dayton, Ohio, and another 450-apartment complex in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nMost buyers would have looked twice: the Memphis estate was in bad area with poor tenants. The sprawling Ohio property had been bankrupted before. Both properties needed lots of work.\n\nAnd then there was the Casino Playa Chiquita on the half-island Dominican Republic, for which Edelsten said he paid $4.4m. He bought it on Mawardi\u2019s recommendation without bothering to look.\n\nThe resort was located in Sosua, away from the tourist strip, the tiny casino only attracting small-rolling locals. Sosua was once a sedate little paradise that had, since 2010 when thousands of desperados fled Haiti following the earthquake, become a crime-riddled hellhole.\n\nTAX DRAMA: ATO fights Geoffrey Edelsten\u2019s debt deal\n\nA simple net search would have showed Edelsten the red flags on this town, ample warnings about the area\u2019s emphasis on robbing and murdering foreigners after luring them into dodgy property deals.\n\nThe casino still operates but the license is not legit; it was issued contingent upon improvements being made to uninhabitable seven-room hotel. Yet, somehow, in the corrupt republic, it continues its modest trade.\n\nSo far, this lot set Edelsten back around $12m.\n\nAnd there was the Bombadier Challenger 601 jet, which Edelsten paid more than $4m and spent hundreds of thousands decking out. It would fly high-rollers to the casino and wealthy customers to Nurielle\u2019s far-flung boutiques.\n\nEdelsten had offered Mawardi a good deal: he\u2019d get an equal share in the title to all the properties (a third, smaller investor, David Levy, was to take out a 14 per cent share, but he never coughed up the cash).\n\nMawardi would share with Edelsten half-ownership in his Florida bar and nightclub, plus several other small \u2014 and troubled \u2014 properties.\n\nImportantly, the Mawardis were expected to manage the housing estates and the casino. But they were clothes and shoemakers. They had no experience running and repairing an extensive property portfolio.\n\nGABI GRECKO: \u2018I still have a life of my own\u2019\n\nArsonists hit the Tennessee apartments. Edelsten went for a $10m insurance claim over a property for which he\u2019d paid $1.7m, but immediately ran into problems when the insurer complained about irregularities in the policy application, leading to one of many drawn-out legal battles to come.\n\nParts of the Ohio apartments were declared unfit for habitation; taxes and insurance went unpaid.\n\nEdelsten had become an American slumlord. The Mawardis said he\u2019d always assured them finance was no issue, that he was the \u201cmoney man\u201d. But now he saw that rehabilitating the properties would cost a fortune.\n\nEdelsten panicked. And with reason. In the 80s, when he ran the Sydney superclinics, everything was leased \u2014 the fast pink cars, the chopper, even the waiting-room grand pianos. He never owned anything; when he was bankrupted, there were few assets to liquidate.\n\nEDELSTEN WANTED A LUXURIOUS LIFE\n\nThis time, uncharacteristically, he\u2019d spent his own money.\n\nHe told Mawardi he was temporarily cash-strapped and urgently needed him to provide some quick cash for the operations, promising to pay him back once he\u2019d shifted some cash in his trust around.\n\nMawardi felt Edelsten was squeezing him but could not afford to put Edelsten off-side. Mawardi was introduced to Liron Ben-Shimon, described by Mawardi in later testimony as a \u201ccollector\u201d, who is \u201cvery connected to the Israeli mafia\u201d.\n\nIN LOVE: Gabi Grecko opens up on becoming Mrs Edelsten\n\nAn arrangement took place with the blessing of a witness rabbi, Mawardi to receive more than $300,000 in \u201cbrown paper bags\u201d. He believed that Edelsten would step in and repay Ben-Shimon later. Edelsten never did.\n\nInstead, Edelsten went behind Mawardi\u2019s back and removed his name from the title to several joint-venture properties, claiming sole ownership.\n\nHe also flogged the plane for a quarter of its worth. \u201cI paid for everything,\u201d Edelsten would later explain at a US hearing. \u201cI want either my money back or the properties.\u201d\n\nIt was true he paid for most things. It also true that he signed a contract promising to do so; and didn\u2019t keep his end of the bargain in providing the money to fork out the cash to rebuild and maintain the dire properties.\n\nEdelsten flew to the US with his lawyers in September 2012 to meet Mawardi. Each accused the other of fraud.\n\nThe meeting ended \u2014 according to Edelsten \u2014 with Mawardi attempting to blackmail him, claiming he had an \u201cembarrassing video\u201d featuring Brynne that he would release to the Australian press unless Edelsten gave him $1.5m (the alleged video never materialised).\n\nEdelsten claimed Mawardi had \u201csolicited\u201d him to invest in numerous properties; had provided false books showing the fashion house was making $2m a year when it was in loss; and later learned the casino was worth only around $1m.\n\nThe Marwadis countersued that Edelsten had not backed the joint venture with cash, had removed their names from title to the properties, and executed mortgages over them without their consent.\n\nBy late last year, after hundreds of court filings and hearings involving many teams of lawyers, the general disposition was that Edelsten had deprived the Mawardis of their interests by reneging on the deal.\n\nIn June 2013, a Florida court appointed a receiver and ordered Edelsten make no further property title transfers. Four months later, Edelsten executed a mortgage on the Ohio property without the court\u2019s consent.\n\nThe mortgage was, according to US Bankruptcy Court judge Lawrence Walter, granted to an Australian company, Highgate Road, wholly owned by Lindsay Hosking, Edelsten\u2019s longstanding accountant.\n\nHighgate then sought to foreclose its mortgage. Edelsten said it had nothing to do with him.\n\nJudge Walter disagreed: \u201cAlthough Edelsten testified that the foreclosure filing was a surprise to him, it is not credible that his trusted corporate accountant would take such an action without the complicity of Edelsten.\u201d\n\nLikewise, Edelsten granted a $2 million mortgage over the Tennessee apartments to Australian business associate, Alan Kwan, for which Kwan gave Edelsten nothing in return.\n\nThis is what the judge called Edelsten\u2019s \u201copportunistic manipulation of facts and circumstances \u2014 a sort of multifaceted shell game \u2014 to achieve some advantage for Edelsten and corresponding disadvantage for his opponents\u201d.\n\nIn Australia, the police would be sent in. But the US legal system is forgiving, always looking favourably towards mediated outcomes \u2014 perhaps because the US legal system is itself close to bankruptcy.\n\nBRYNNE OPENS UP: What she thought of THAT proposal\n\nIn September 2013, the parties agreed to settle, with Edelsten essentially agreeing to pay the Mawardis a half share of the disputed assets.\n\nIt went wrong immediately after Edelsten violated court orders by again transferring titles. He was due to face a criminal contempt hearing on January 10, 2014. The day before he was due in court, he filed for bankruptcy in the US.\n\nAnd the day prior to that, Edelsten\u2019s Melbourne law firm filed a caveat over his personal luxury three-apartment residence in Melbourne, in favour of his mother, Esther.\n\nThe reason given was to protect a loan she had given him to fight his court battles; others wondered if he was using his mum to protect his Australian assets.\n\nMost of Edelsten\u2019s money resided in the Norman South Trust, in Australia, described in US proceedings as a sham designed to avoid paying tax. It held profits from the sale of the medical business and Edelsten was the sole beneficiary.\n\nPrior to filing for bankruptcy, Edelsten vested control of his Norman Smith trust to \u201ctwo of his insiders\u201d, being his lawyer and accountant.\n\nThis was described as a way to hide his assets from the bankruptcy proceedings, but Edelsten\u2019s lawyers argued he had no control over the trust.\n\nThe judge disagreed: \u201cWell, that assumes, of course, that Mr (Lindsay) Hosking and Mr (Michael) Webb, who are Mr Edelsten\u2019s lawyer and accountant, respectively, will act completely independently of Mr Edelsten, a proposition that is interesting, but not exactly persuasive.\u201d\n\nThe Mawardi\u2019s lawyer, Robert Stok, slammed Edelsten for concealing assets using a \u201cbyzantine web of obfuscation\u201d.\n\nThe judge agreed: \u201cHis practice is to hold assets in discrete limited liability companies and trusts, most of which he controls personally or through surrogates such as his mother, lawyer, accountant, or business associates.\u201d\n\nThen Alfie Mawardi got stabbed. He was outside his Florida office, about 9am, when a man ran from the bushes holding a knife. Mawardi alleged his attacker was the brother of Ben-Shimon, punishing him for his unpaid debt.\n\nMawardi accused Edelsten of conspiring with Ben-Shimon in the attack that left him in the emergency ward, needing 60 stitches. And he pointed out that Edelsten had form in Australia for hiring hit men.\n\nWEIRD ROMANCE: The world of Brynne Gordon and Geoffrey Edelsten\n\nHe claimed Edelsten had threatened to \u201csilence\u201d him once before if he revealed to Brynne that he\u2019d had a fling, in Miami, with Stacy da Silva, whom he\u2019d met on a \u201csugar daddy\u201d website he frequented.\n\nBen-Shimon and Edelsten angrily denied the accusations. No one has yet been charged over the stabbing.\n\nMawardi has been left in a state of hysteria from his dealings with Edelsten. When I spoke to him in 2012, he was at the point of breakdown. He hasn\u2019t improved.\n\nHis lawyer, Robert Stok, has told him to \u201cshut up\u201d in deposition hearings and threatened to walk out if he failed to answer the questions asked of him, rather than ranting incoherently about all he says Edelsten has done to him.\n\nEDELSTEN\u2019S MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR LEGAL SAGA\n\nUnravelling Edelsten\u2019s true financial position has proven difficult. He is deliberately vague and his lawyer Michael Webb seems genuinely not to know, having relied on the accounting statements of Lindsay Hosking.\n\nHosking has been unavailable to assist investigators, having in quick order had a heart attack, a stroke and then being diagnosed with cancer.\n\nIn late October, just after the ATO entered the scene saying Edelsten owed it $14.1m, the Mawardis, Edelsten, his trust, Ben-Shimon and the US Trustee reached a court-approved settlement. As part of the settlement, no party is permitted to disparage the other and all related legal actions must cease.\n\nThe settlement requires Edelsten to pay the US Trustee $1.25m from the sale of his Palazzo Versace condo in Queensland and his Quay West apartment in the Rocks, Sydney. He will also keep more than 50 per cent of any assets held by his trust.\n\nThat might sound favourable, but it contains the implicit belief by the US parties that Edelsten \u2014 once he pays the $1.25m \u2014 will have nothing left.\n\nSeveral Australian properties (including a small house and a contaminated industrial estate) that Edelsten has been permitted to \u201ckeep\u201d are effectively owned by the National Australia Bank, which will foreclose on them.\n\nThe Tennessee property was earlier sold and the proceeds split between the Mawardis and Edelsten, money that has no doubt since been spent on lawyers; the Ohio property was also sold and the $1m remaining is held by the Ohio bankruptcy court.\n\nThe money from the sale of the plane will be split; and the casino \u2014 currently uninsured because no one\u2019s paying the premiums \u2014 will be sold as a matter of urgency and split three ways. Ben-Shimon will get a third.\n\nBut they\u2019ve tried to flog it before. No one\u2019s interested. It\u2019s worth as much as a dodgy badlands cantina in a gangland Mexican city.\n\nEdelsten\u2019s three conjoined Melbourne luxury apartments (where he lived until early this year with Brynne) will be valued and it is agreed Edelsten can buy them and pay the trustee at 80 per cent of their value \u2014 if he can raise the money, which he can\u2019t.\n\nBrynne also claims rights to them; so he\u2019d have to pay her off if he wants to own them again.\n\nThere\u2019s also his supposed Indonesian coal and sand interests, which Edelsten has valued at $10m, but no one \u2014 including his lawyer \u2014 knows if they\u2019re real. These will be investigated and sold off, if possible.\n\nWith unsecured claims against him of at least $30m, including the money the Australian Tax Office is owed, Edelsten is finished.\n\nThe ATO appeared in the US bankruptcy court this week, arguing the court failed to take into account that it is Edelsten\u2019s largest creditor when the settlement was agreed.\n\nAnother mediation hearing has been ordered to take place within 60 days to see whether if the ATO can be cut into the deal. But it will first have to fight those who reached the hard-fought settlement \u2014 and they will not give up easily.\n\nThis is the ATO\u2019s own fault. It failed to move on Edelsten\u2019s taxes after he sold out of Allied; and failed to make itself a party to the US bankruptcy proceedings, though it\n\nwas well aware of them.\n\nIt has already dropped its demand down to $9m, but by the estimate of Robert Stok, it would be \u201coptimistic\u201d for them to walk away with anything more than $500,000.\n\nThis is the world Gabi Grecko has entered, where nothing is quite as it seems and where even Edelsten himself may no longer sure what parts of it are real.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config":
