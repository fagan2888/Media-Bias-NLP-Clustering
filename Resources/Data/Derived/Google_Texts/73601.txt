Carly Fiorina was still feeding off the momentum from her breakout debate performance when she stepped on the RedState Gathering stage in Atlanta, GA, Friday afternoon.

“I think we kind of rumbled last night,” Fiorina began.

She got right down to what makes her stand out among her GOP opponents.

“I’ve gained a reputation for saying things other people aren’t prepared to say.”

One of those bold proclamations she was referring to was her fearlessness in directly challenging Hillary Clinton to defend her resume.

“I asked this question of Hillary Clinton, ‘Mrs. Clinton, flying is an activity, not an accomplishment. Please name an accomplishment.'"

"You know, we don’t have an answer yet.’”

Fiorina repeated these sentiments after the debate to MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, who seemed dumbfounded by her comments and insisted she explain herself.

“As I told Chris Matthews over and over again, she did lie about Benghazi, she did lie about emails, and she did lie about her server.”

Fiorina didn’t just spend her whole speech slamming the presumptive Democratic nominee. She laid out her vision for America, promoting economic policies like zero-based budgeting and ensuring voters that she would dispel those nasty myths from the Democratic Party that claim Republicans are waging a war on women and minorities.

“That’s what we need to win this job,” she said. “I can win this job.”
