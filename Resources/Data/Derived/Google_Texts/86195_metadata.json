She has fought for an increased minimum wage, immigration reform and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nCampbell shared her peace-making philosophies from her book, \"A Nun on the Bus: How All of Us Can Create Hope, Change, and Community\" with a multi-faith crowd at Pacific University April 6. Here are four of her tips for changing the world.\n\nLeadership comes from \"We the People\"\n\nWaiting for federal leaders to make social change on their own doesn't tend to yield significant results, Campbell said.\n\nTo free the folks in Congress \"from the fear they have for the other,\" she suggests taking matters into your own hands by simply talking about important issues.\n\nShe advocates for what she calls \"grocery store missionary work,\" an approach in which you might turn to a person in line at the grocery store and ask his or her views on a given political issue.\n\nWhile this stranger-to-stranger approach may not have worked out for Starbucks' attempt at discussing race, the benefit, Campbell said, is that the conversation doesn't have to last long if it goes sour.\n\nIf in-line awkwardness isn't your thing, though, approaching friends and loved-ones with a sincere desire for understanding can't hurt your cause.\n\nHope is a communal virtue\n\nWhen hope is in low supply, ruminating alone on whatever impending defeat you face rarely generates much of a moral boost, Campbell said.\n\nEspecially in the slow-moving world of politics, she said, \"You can't do it alone.\" Getting together with like-minded people helps foster hope in a way one typically can't alone, she said.\n\nFight for, not against\n\nIn politics, you're bound to come up against some opposition. The natural response is to push back, but Campbell said it's best to channel that energy into fighting for, rather than against, something.\n\nIn other words, try to identify some common goal that you and your opposition can work toward together.\n\nCampbell gave the example of a meeting she had with a group of CEOs in Chicago. The CEOs brought up their $10 million average salaries and how they were pushing to reach $11 million.\n\nWere they not getting by on $10 million, Campbell recalled asking, perhaps with a helping of sarcasm?\n\nIt turned out, as one CEO put it, they were all competing with each other, trying to win in a realm where the measure of victory is how much money one makes. They wanted to compete with each other, and Campbell wanted them to spread the wealth.\n\nRather than pushing back at them for wanting to win, Campbell thought it better to try changing the measure of winning to something a bit more universally beneficial for society. The CEOs would still get to compete, and the social causes she supports might see some help.\n\nHumor is key\n\nCampbell relies on humor when making her case to political opponents. It helps people relax, she said, allowing them to hear the serious parts of her argument on a deeper level than if they were being barraged by hardball assertions.\n\nA bit of laughter and joy can make all the difference, she said, because it helps build a community. As long as respect for everyone's humanity is there, a well-meaning joke will, ideally, not fall on unwilling ears.\n\nIn short, getting a laugh can help get your point across. Just ask Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert and Bill Maher, each of whose political satire shows Campbell has appeared on.\n\n--Dillon Pilorget\n\ndpilorget@oregonian.com\n\n503-294-5927\n\n@ForestGReporter", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Dillon Pilorget | The Oregonian/OregonLive", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "forest grove lifestyles, forest grove news, news, Nuns on the Bus, pacific university, Sister Simone Campbell", "title": "4 universal tips for changing the world from the 'nun on the bus,' Sister Simone Campbell", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"4 universal tips for changing the world from the \\u0027nun on the bus,\\u0027 Sister Simone Campbell\", \"link\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/forest-grove/index.ssf/2015/04/3_universal_tips_for_changing.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/leader/photo/2015/04/07/17451493-large.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"15657036\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-04-08T12:02:29Z\", \"author\": \"Dillon Pilorget | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"tags\": [\"@argus\",\"@fg-leader\",\"@forest-grove\",\"@hillsboro\",\"@hp-top-stories\",\"@religion\",\"@washington-county\",\"forest grove lifestyles\",\"forest grove news\",\"news\",\"Nuns on the Bus\",\"pacific university\",\"Sister Simone Campbell\"] }", "twitter": {"description": "Sister Simone Campbell, author of \"A Nun on the Bus,\" spoke to a crowd at Pacific University about how to make change in the world April 6.", "title": "4 universal tips for changing the world from the 'nun on the bus,' Sister Simone Campbell", "image": "http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/leader/photo/2015/04/07/17451493-large.jpg", "creator": "@DillonPilorget", "site": "@Oregonian", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Wednesday, April 08, 2015,  5:02 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"4 tips for changing the world from a traveling nun\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.oregonlive.com/leader/photo/2015/04/07/17451493-large.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dpilorget\", \"author_nickname\": \"Dillon Pilorget | The Oregonian/OregonLive\", \"author_id\": \"11866495\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Forest Grove News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.oregonlive.com/forest-grove/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "OregonLive.com", "description": "Sister Simone Campbell, author of \"A Nun on the Bus,\" spoke to a crowd at Pacific University about how to make change in the world April 6.", "title": "4 universal tips for changing the world from the 'nun on the bus,' Sister Simone Campbell", "url": "http://www.oregonlive.com/forest-grove/index.ssf/2015/04/3_universal_tips_for_changing.html", "image": "http://image.oregonlive.com/home/olive-media/width620/img/leader/photo/2015/04/07/17451493-large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "OregonLive.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/dillon.pilorget.3"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Wednesday, April 08, 2015,  5:00 AM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Sister Simone Campbell, author of \"A Nun on the Bus,\" spoke to a crowd at Pacific University about how to make change in the world April 6."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0389\"", "article_summary": "Leadership comes from \"We the People\"Waiting for federal leaders to make social change on their own doesn't tend to yield significant results, Campbell said.\nCampbell shared her peace-making philosophies from her book, \"A Nun on the Bus: How All of Us Can Create Hope, Change, and Community\" with a multi-faith crowd at Pacific University April 6.\nTraveling across the country on a bus with her fellow lobbying nuns, Sister Simone Campbell has picked up a few tricks of the trade in attempting to change the world for the better.\nJust ask Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert and Bill Maher, each of whose political satire shows Campbell has appeared on.\nHere are four of her tips for changing the world."}
