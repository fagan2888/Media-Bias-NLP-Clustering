After that, it\u2019s either stroke, respiratory diseases or accidents.\n\nBut what are the maladies least expected yet have a disproportionately high chance of striking in your state?\n\nUsing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Slate Magazine has compiled a number of maps, including the one we\u2019re reproduced above. That map shows which ailments among the top 10 overall causes of death that are unusually high in certain states.\n\nSo if you\u2019re from Missouri, the most likely way you\u2019ll die is either through heart disease or stroke, but watch out for kidney ailments. The same is true in North Carolina. In Montana, the main causes of death are cancer and respiratory diseases, but Big Sky Country also has an disproportionately high number of accidental fatalities. For some reason, Utah and Ohio have an extraordinarily high number of deaths from diabetes.\n\nAnd heart disease, stroke or respiratory diseases are the most common path to the hereafter in several Southern states and the Eastern seaboard, but beware of something called Septicemia just in case.\n\nWhat is Septicemia? We had to look it up ourselves in the National Library of Medicine, and it wasn\u2019t fun. It\u2019s a bacteria that forms in the blood that can occur with such infections as meningitis or osteomyelitis, and can be fatal in a hurry.\n\nFollow Russ on Twitter @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow Health Exchange on Twitter @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore must-read health coverage from MarketWatch:\n\nObamacare data inconsistencies affect one-fourth of all applicants\n\nMedtronic is another reported suitor for Smith & Nephew\n\nGlaxoSmithKline reaches pact over drug marketing allegations", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-06-05T13:25:07-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Heart disease and cancer are the most common causes of death but what are the ones to watch for in your state?", "title": "The cause of death you probably won\u2019t see coming in your state", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/06/05/the-cause-of-death-you-probably-wont-see-coming-in-your-state/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CG804_cause__MG_20140605123059.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Causes of death,Causes of death by state,health,Public health issues", "article.headline": "The cause of death you probably won\u2019t see coming in your state", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "Causes of death,Causes of death by state,health,Public health issues", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "description": "Heart disease and cancer are the most common causes of death but what are the ones to watch for in your state?", "article.published": "2014-06-05T13:25:07-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/06/05/the-cause-of-death-you-probably-wont-see-coming-in-your-state/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Heart disease and cancer are the most common causes of death but what are the ones to watch for in your state?", "title": "The cause of death you probably won\u2019t see coming in your state", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/06/05/the-cause-of-death-you-probably-wont-see-coming-in-your-state/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CG804_cause__MG_20140605123059.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2647", "article.updated": "2014-06-05T13:25:07-04:00"}, "article_summary": "After that, it\u2019s either stroke, respiratory diseases or accidents.\nThose who ponder the inevitable probably already know that heart disease is the most common causes of death in most states, and cancer in a few northern climes.\nFor some reason, Utah and Ohio have an extraordinarily high number of deaths from diabetes.\nIn Montana, the main causes of death are cancer and respiratory diseases, but Big Sky Country also has an disproportionately high number of accidental fatalities.\nThat map shows which ailments among the top 10 overall causes of death that are unusually high in certain states."}
