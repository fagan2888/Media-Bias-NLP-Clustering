— The advisers helping local residents enroll in health insurance made available under President Barack Obama’s signature Affordable Care Act say Year 1 was a pretty good one: 7 million covered nationwide, nearly 1 million in Florida, 230,000 in the Tampa Bay area.

But U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, a Democrat from Tampa, warned local “navigators” Wednesday not to rest on their laurels.

“We’re going to hit it out of the park this year,” she told health care workers and reporters at a news conference aimed at spreading word of next year’s open enrollment period. “Together by Feb. 15, we’re going to beat that number of 1 million enrolled in Florida and do even better, and make sure our families have the financial security they deserve.”

Enrollment in policies offered on the Health Insurance Marketplace begins Saturday and runs for three months. Melanie Hall, executive director of the Family Healthcare Foundation, said navigators have two goals — reach out to the uninsured to help them enroll for the first time and make sure that the 1 million now covered review and renew coverage.

Navigators have organized many enrollment events to provide help; (813) 995-1066 is the number to call for a schedule or enrollment advice.

Hall said one of the chief reasons given by those who failed to enroll was they couldn’t afford insurance. “We have a really important message: There is financial help available,” she said.

In fact, Hall noted that 91 percent of the 1 million who enrolled in Florida received financial help and pay an average premium of $68 a month.

Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn, a backer of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, served as head cheerleader at Wednesday’s news conference.

“The basic, fundamental premise that people are entitled to decent health care benefits all of us,” Buckhorn said. “We’ve got to go register another million.”
