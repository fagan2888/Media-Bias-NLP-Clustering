Rules, regulations and recordkeeping requirements are continually being updated in the agriculture labor area. Michigan State University Extension has partnered with several State, Federal, and local partners to bring a series of Agriculture Labor meetings to Michigan. A total of six meetings are being held across the state.

Managing your workforce and complying with labor laws requires you to keep up to date on many fronts. Keeping yourself and your workforce safe will impact productivity, profitability, and most importantly save lives.
