The Denver Police Department and Denver Sheriff Department are warning the public about callers claiming to be sheriffâ€™s department officers asking for money.

Community members are getting calls from scammers who claim to be officials who make a bogus claim that people owe money for an outstanding warrant, according to a Denver Sheriff Department news release.

Another person was told they missed jury duty and need to pay fines for a warrant that had been issued for their arrest.

Neither department makes phone calls to collect fines or solicit money, the release said.

Anyone who receives a call of this nature is asked to hang up and contact the Denver Police Department at 720-913-2000.
