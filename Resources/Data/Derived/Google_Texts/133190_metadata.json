Dylan is the master of the rhetorical question, whether asking \u201cHow does it feel to be on your own?,\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re so hurt, why then don\u2019t you show it?,\u201d and \u201cHow be it we are so deceived, when the truth\u2019s in our hearts and we still don\u2019t believe?\u201d Hovering over the ad, with its economic nativism (\u201cLet Germany make your beer, let Switzerland make your watch, let Asia assemble your phone...we will build your car\u201d) is the rhetorical question: Just how American is Chrysler, a \u201cwholly owned subsidiary\u201d of Italy's Fiat?\n\nThe ad provoked any number of responses on Twitter, including the plaintive wail that \u201cBob Dylan is now a car salesman. #helpus.\u201d After tweeting some of the lyrics to Dylan\u2019s 1983 track \u201cUnion Sundown\u201d\u2014a tale of global capitalism run amok, unions that are \"going out like a dinosaur,\" and the inscrutable claim that \u201cthey used to grow food in Kansas/Now they want to grow it on the moon and eat it raw\u201d\u2014Talking Point Memo\u2019s Josh Josh Marshall concluded, \u201cA little humorous to see this shock, shock since Dylan's always been extremely commercially attuned, financially successful performer.\u201d Well, sure. Dylan is no stranger to making commercials, including a 2004 Victoria\u2019s Secret ad which is pure, 100 percent John Carradine creepiness (that\u2019s a compliment).\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: Dylan\u2019s greatest asset over the course of his long and still-going-strong career is precisely his willingness to disappoint and shock his fans and force them to reconsider their relationship to their singing savior. No other artist has done it as consistently, repeatedly, and forcefully as Dylan, who changes identities like most of us change our socks. Indeed, the main reason that Dylan is the most important creative force in post-war America is what my Reason colleague Brian Doherty once identified as \u201cthe wonderfully inauthentic art of America\u2019s most vital singer-songwriter.\u201d Dylan is always changing, always mutating, always \u201cnot there,\u201d but someplace way out there on the horizon.\n\nAn incomplete list of Dylan\u2019s career restlessness would include breaking with folk tradition first by writing his own stuff and then going electric (thank Gawd!); asserting empathy not just for Medgar Evers' assassin, but for Lee Harvey Oswald (\u201cI saw some of myself in him,\u201d Dylan said while accepting an award named for Tom Paine and almost ruining his young career). At the exact moment when he should have emerged as the nation's hyper-politicized hippie troubador in the mid-to-late 1960s, he retreated first into seclusion, then into traditional music, and finally, confessional reflection. As the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and even third-tier bands such as the Rascals and the Guess Who sloganeered via hit songs, Dylan turned inward regarding subject matter, sometimes disastrously (e.g., Self Portrait) and sometimes transcendently (Blood on the Tracks, a searing, self-incriminating depiction of the end of his first marriage).\n\nOn a big-selling album such as 1976\u2019s Desire, he returned to protest music (\u201cHurricane\u201d) but confounded that gesture by also including a paean to an unregenerate mafioso (\u201cJoey\u201d) on the same disc. In the late '70s, he made arguably his most daring and successful album by turning to hard-core evangelicalism on the spiritually epic Slow Train Coming (1979), where he improbably sang,\n\nMy so-called friends\n\nHave fallen under a spell\n\nThey look me squarely in the eye\n\nAnd they say, \"Well, all is well\" Can they imagine the darkness\n\nThat will fall from on high\n\nWhen men will beg God to kill them\n\nAnd they won't be able to die?\n\nThat his conversion\u2014heartfelt, if not particularly long-lived\u2014came during the cresdendo of the most hedonistic period in recent American history arguably represented more of a rupture with his audience than when he went electric. He emerged just a few short years laters with another highly praised album, Infidels (1983), which led folks to wonder if Dylan was now a born-again Jew. Dylan visited Israel the year the LP came out, was photographed wearing a yarmulke, and recorded an unapologetically pro-Israel song \"Neighborhood Bully,\" which was the Soda Stream controversy of its day.\n\nIn his memoir Chronicles Vol. 1 (2004), he copped to the fact that Barry Goldwater was his favorite politician in the early 1960s even as he was making his name singing lefty protest songs in Greenwich Village. \u201cThere was no point in arguing with Dave [Van Ronk]\u201d Dylan wrote, name-checking the self-proclaimed \u201cMayor of MacDougal Street\u201d and partial inspiration for the lead character in the new movie Inside Lewyn Davis, \u201cnot intellectually anyway. I had a primitive way of looking at things and I liked country fair politics. My favorite politician was Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, who reminded me of Tom Mix, and there wasn't any way to explain that to anybody.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Dylan has patently refused to be gulled by Rolling Stone magazine into saying he was in favor of green energy or Obama or whatever liberal cause du jour the writers and editors trot out for him to validate. His 2009 Christmas in the Heart album is more challenging to long-settled aesthetics than Duchamp's path-breaking \"Fountain\" ever was (Dylan somehow makes the song \u201cHere Comes Santa Claus\u201d into one of the most sinister tunes ever recorded).\n\nIn short, Dylan is an artist that purposefully makes his fans uncomfortable, not out of anger or contempt for his audience, but out of an undiminished sense of adventure, exploration, and creativity. In this, Dylan is the polar opposite of the recently deceased Pete Seeger, who famously wanted to cut Dylan's electricity at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival and never, ever discomfited his fans (or the Comintern, for that matter) for a second. Where so many writers, filmmakers, artists simply repeat themselves or flatter their audience's inflated sense of itself, Dylan is, after all these years, \u201cstill on the road/Heading for another joint.\u201d\n\nSo how does it feel to see Dylan pitching Chrysler by that most underhanded of all of tactics, that\u2019s it\u2019s made in America? Chrysler, for god's sake! That\u2019s a third-rate company that should have gone tits up back when Ronald Reagan was in the White House! A company that got bailed out by the American taxpayer and then sold for a song to Italy\u2019s Fiat while stiffing its own U.S.-based creditors? And the former Robert Zimmerman is telling us not just to buy these jalopies but to do so because they're made in the U.S.A.?\n\nWell, truth be told, it feels pretty bad. Better that he should be hawking lingerie or Pepsi. But here's the real takeaway: Why the hell are you, me, or any of us expecting insight, wisdom, or god forbid, authenticity from Bob Dylan, of all people?\n\nThe entire meaning of his life's art is that it ain't him, babe\u2014no, no, no, it ain\u2019t him, babe, it aint him you\u2019re lookin\u2019 for. Or to put it only slightly differently: \"We're idiots, babe/It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Absolutely not.
