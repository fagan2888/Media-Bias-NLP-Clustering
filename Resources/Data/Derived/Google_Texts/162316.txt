A Rapid City man and his girlfriend each has been sentenced to half a year in jail for being accessories to rape.



Twenty-year-old Alexander Martinez and 22-year-old Kristina Hague were accused of supplying a 15-year-old girl with alcohol to persuade her to have sex in January 2012. They were charged with rape but eventually pleaded guilty to being accessories to rape.



Pennington County State's Attorney Scott Roetzel says the plea agreement spares the victim from having to testify at a trial.



Hague was sentenced last month and Martinez this week. Each was given 180 days in jail and five years of probation.
