It will affect preferred provider network plans - PPOs - in particular. A consumer favorite, PPO plans allow members to go to any doctor \u2013 specialist or otherwise \u2013 without a referral from a primary care physician.\n\nA primary care doctor can help a consumer \"navigate the system,\" says Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California. The absence of that relationship in PPO plans is one reason emergency room visits have surged since passage of the Affordable Care Act, he says, in explaining why his agency added the primary physician requirement to its new three-year contract with insurers.\n\nThe concept, Lee says, is borrowed from HMOs, such as Kaiser Permanente. The difference is that, under the new Covered California rule, members of PPOs won't be required to visit their assigned doctor before seeking out a specialist.\n\n\"These people are not gatekeepers,\" Lee says. \"Their job is to help people navigate a complex system, but not to be the mother-may-I doctors of the past.\"\n\nThe California Association of Health Plans says that its members are prepared to move forward with Covered California's new policy.\n\n\"Our members have a lot of experience in the assignment of primary care providers through their HMO products,\" says CAHP spokeswoman Nicole Evans.", "article_metadata": {"author": "Southern California Public Radio", "og": {"site_name": "Southern California Public Radio", "description": "PPO plans, which don't require primary care referrals to see specialists, now must assign members a primary care doctor \u2014 but members don't have to use them.", "title": "Covered California wants everyone to have a primary care doctor", "url": "http://www.scpr.org/news/2016/04/15/59621/covered-california-acts-to-ensure-everyone-gets-a/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://a.scpr.org/i/0135f569d05256255b9f99c9796482d1/113961-full.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 683}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://scpr.org", "description": "Member-supported public radio for Southern California.
