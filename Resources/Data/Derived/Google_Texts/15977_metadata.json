He was charged with heading the final implementation of Obamacare ahead of the opening of the online health exchanges.\n\nJennings resigned from the post after six months, citing health concerns, but it was reported later in the year by Congressional Quarterly that Jennings had \u201cquietly reopened\u201d his firm Jennings Policy Strategies.\n\nBecause Jennings is now doing \u201cnon-lobbying\u201d work, he is not required to disclose his clients. The one company he admitted to advising was Theranos, a medical testing company that claimed to invent an industry-changing machine and was valued at $9 billion.\n\nTheranos claimed to invent a blood test that could provide results for a fraction of the cost of current blood tests, one that would require only drops of blood taken via a finger-prick rather than a full vial from a needle.\n\nThe company\u2019s founder, Elizabeth Holmes, who became the \u201cworld\u2019s youngest female billionaire\u201d with Theranos, said that the technology allowed for \u201csomething like a cholesterol test [for] $2.99\u201d that could be performed at a local pharmacy.\n\nIt is unclear whether Jennings knew when he signed on as an adviser for the company that these claims were wildly optimistic, and that the technology that promised to drastically reduce health costs was not all it was made out to be.\n\nA thorough Wall Street Journal expos\u00e9 published in October based on internal Theranos emails and interviews with multiple former Theranos revealed that the technology invented by Theranos, a blood-testing machine called the \u201cEdison,\u201d was producing results so inaccurate that the company stopped using it for a large majority of its tests.\n\nDue to the inaccuracy of the Edison, Theranos decided to not use the machine during federally mandated proficiency tests carried out by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services even though they were actively using the machine at the time.\n\nTheranos admitted to reporter John Carreyrou that the Edison\u2014the machine that got Holmes named one of the five \u201cvisionary tech entrepreneurs who are changing the world\u201d by the New York Times\u2014was used for less than 10 percent of the company\u2019s tests in 2014.\n\nThe revelations are quickly unraveling the success that Theranos had built.\n\nCarreyrou reported on Tuesday that Safeway Inc., which spent $350 million to put Theranos clinics in its stores, has begun negotiations to dissolve its partnership with Theranos. Walgreens halted development of Theranos blood-testing stations that it was putting in its stores just a week after the initial report.\n\nTheranos has claimed that the Wall Street Journal report on its Safeway deal is \u201cinaccurate, misleading and defamatory.\u201d\n\nTheranos did not respond to a request for it to elaborate on the extent of Jennings\u2019 involvement with the company.\n\nJennings worked closely with Hillary Clinton when she attempted reform the health care system at the beginning of her husband\u2019s first term and now serves as an \u201cinformal adviser\u201d to her presidential campaign.\n\nAsked whether he would ever return to the White House, Jennings told Congressional Quarterly that \u201cHRC knows\u201d that he \u201calways \u2026 will be on call for her wherever she decides she can best serve.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign also did not respond to a request for comment.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "A longtime adviser to both Bill and Hillary Clinton on health care issues that is currently advising Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign also advised Theranos, a health care start-up that has quickly tu", "title": "Clinton Campaign Adviser Also Advised Fast Faltering Health Care Company", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/politics/clinton-campaign-adviser-also-advised-fast-faltering-health-care-company/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chris-Jennings-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A longtime adviser to both Bill and Hillary Clinton on health care issues that is currently advising", "title": "Clinton Campaign Adviser Also Advised Fast Faltering Health Care Company", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Chris-Jennings-150x150.jpg", "creator": "@brentscher", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "BY: Follow @brentscherA longtime adviser to both Bill and Hillary Clinton on health care issues that is currently advising Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign also advised Theranos, a health care start-up that has quickly turned from an industry darling to being labeled a fraud.\nJennings worked closely with Hillary Clinton when she attempted reform the health care system at the beginning of her husband\u2019s first term and now serves as an \u201cinformal adviser\u201d to her presidential campaign.\nHillary Clinton claims to be the enemy of drug companies but she is no enemy of Chris Jennings, who made millions of dollars as a lobbyist for the pharmaceutical industry after he served as the top health care adviser for the Clinton White House.\nPresident Barack Obama brought him on board in 2013 to coordinate health reform for the White House despite his decade of lobbying.\nThe one company he admitted to advising was Theranos, a medical testing company that claimed to invent an industry-changing machine and was valued at $9 billion."}
