HATTIESBURG, Miss. (AP) - The University of Southern Mississippi has seen enrollment drop nearly 9 percent since 2011, forcing campus-wide budget cuts for the coming fall.

The Hattiesburg American (http://hatne.ws/1KHby2W) reports that enrollment fell from nearly 16,200 in fall 2011 to less than 14,800 in fall 2014.

Douglas Vinzant, vice president for finance and administration, says state appropriations used to play a bigger part in the university’s budget, but tuition has become more important.

He says budget cuts ordered for this fall add up to about $5.9 million. He says that’s about 2.9 percent of the education and general budget of $248.7 million.

He says many positions were left vacant, and about nine staffers were laid off.
