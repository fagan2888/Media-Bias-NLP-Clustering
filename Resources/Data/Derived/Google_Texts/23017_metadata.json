WordPress\n\nAround 6,000 children under the age of 5 die each day as a result of conditions that include diarrhea, malaria, and pneumonia, according to a recent UNICEF report. Working with the governments of Ethiopia, India, and the United States, UNICEF launched a global effort \u2014 dubbed Committing to Child Survival: A Promise Renewed \u2014 to stop preventable child death last year.\n\nBack in 1990, the estimated yearly total for deaths in those under 5 years old was 12.6 million. Compare that to 6.6 million in 2012 and we can see the program has helped save close to 90 million lives in the span of 22 years. A total of 176 governments have currently signed up for the initiative, in addition to private individuals, religious sectors, and civil societies.\n\n\u201cYes, we should celebrate the progress,\u201d Anthony Lake, executive director of UNICEF, said in a statement. \u201cBut how can we celebrate when there is so much more to do before we reach the goal? And we can speed up the progress \u2014 we know how, but we need to act with a renewed sense of urgency.\u201d\n\nSurprisingly, low-income countries such as Tanzania, Liberia, Ethiopia, and Bangladesh have already reached Millennium Development Goal 4, meaning that they were able to reduce under-five deaths by two-thirds or more since 1990. Unfortunately the program as a whole is not on track to reach the goal that is scheduled for 2015.\n\nCompared to other countries, west and central Africa showed no decrease in the number of children under the age of 5 who have died since 1990. In fact, one in eight children died before the age of 5, giving these regions the highest rate of under-five mortality.\n\n\u201cProgress can and must be made,\u201d said Lake. \u201cWhen concerted action, sound strategies, adequate resources and strong political will are harnessed in support of child and maternal survival, dramatic reductions in child mortality aren\u2019t just feasible, they are morally imperative.\u201d\n\nUNICEF identified healthcare delivery at the community level, sanitation improvements, the spread of immunization programs, educating mothers, and urging mothers to breastfeed as some of the preventative steps taken to reduce child mortality.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "under, five, deaths, unicef, child, mortality, 6000 children", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A report out of UNICEF claims that 6.6 million children under the age of 5 died in 2012 as a result of diseases such as malaria.", "title": "6,000 Children Under The Age Of 5 Die Each Day", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/6000-children-under-age-5-die-each-day-unicef-report-256682", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/13/child-mortality.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A report out of UNICEF claims that 6.6 million children under the age of 5 died in 2012 as a result of diseases such as malaria.", "title": "6,000 Children Under The Age Of 5 Die Each Day", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/6000-children-under-age-5-die-each-day-unicef-report-256682", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/13/child-mortality.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/13/child-mortality.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-13T14:07:20-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-13T14:07:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A report out of UNICEF claims that 6.6 million children under the age of 5 died in 2012 as a result of diseases such as malaria."}, "article_summary": "WordPressAround 6,000 children under the age of 5 die each day as a result of conditions that include diarrhea, malaria, and pneumonia, according to a recent UNICEF report.\nIn fact, one in eight children died before the age of 5, giving these regions the highest rate of under-five mortality.\nA report out of UNICEF claims that 6.6 million children under the age of 5 died in 2012 as a result of diseases such as malaria.\nCompare that to 6.6 million in 2012 and we can see the program has helped save close to 90 million lives in the span of 22 years.\nCompared to other countries, west and central Africa showed no decrease in the number of children under the age of 5 who have died since 1990."}
