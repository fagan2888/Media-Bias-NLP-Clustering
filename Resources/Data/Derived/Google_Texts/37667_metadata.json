Fifty years later, Mr. Clinton observed the anniversary of the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 with a strong reminder about the sacrifices lawmakers must make to advance sweeping and controversial legislation.\n\nWithout mentioning the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Clinton did discuss the pushback that lawmakers faced for voting in support of the Civil Rights Act. He alluded to the current climate in Washington in which some Democrats face the prospect that their support for the bill will hurt their prospects this fall.\n\n\u201cThat is often the case with big votes that change millions of lives,\u201d Mr. Clinton said. \u201cI\u2019ve had my fair share of tough phone calls to good people who lost their seats after we won this or that big measure by just a vote or two in the House or the Senate.\u201d\n\nMr. Clinton delivered his remarks near the hallways of memorabilia from a tumultuous period in American history that line the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library here. He was among three former presidents who came to Austin to commemorate with Mr. Obama the anniversary of landmark legislation that sought to end decades of discrimination.\n\nTopics at the three-day event include gay rights, immigration, women\u2019s rights and education. Mr. Obama and former President George W. Bush are scheduled to speak on Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Clinton also called for the protection of the Voting Rights Act, which passed in 1965. This summer, the Supreme Court overturned a crucial section of the law, and the ruling is expected to have a major impact in Texas, with its large minority voting population. Mr. Clinton also said that barriers being erected in many states that prevent people from voting \u201care seriously undermining the spirit of both the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act.\u201d\n\nRepresentative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia; Johnson\u2019s daughter Luci Baines Johnson; and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s daughter, the Rev. Bernice A. King, among other civil rights activists, delivered a reading before Mr. Clinton took the stage.\n\nMr. Clinton often talks about how his political identity was largely forged during the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, and he has many similarities to Johnson \u2014 with their modest Southern upbringings and styles of retail politics. Mr. Clinton said he remembered hearing Johnson talk about his childhood in Texas. \u201cI thought he was talking about my childhood,\u201d Mr. Clinton said.\n\n(At one point during the speech, Mr. Clinton referred to Johnson as \u201cMr. Clinton.\u201d He said, with a laugh, \u201cPresident Clinton, I know that guy.\u201d)\n\nBut as a young college student, he also protested the Vietnam War that Johnson escalated. That dissonance \u2014 Johnson\u2019s historic civil rights achievement and his administration\u2019s handling of a deeply unpopular war \u2014 is on display at his presidential library, which Mr. Clinton briefly visited after his speech.\n\nOn Tuesday, former President Jimmy Carter cited the unemployment rate of blacks \u2014 it is more than twice the 5.8 percent unemployment rate for whites \u2014 and said the country had been \u201cpretty much dormant\u201d on equality issues since Johnson\u2019s passage of the landmark legislation that ended laws requiring racial segregation.\n\n\u201cWe accept self-congratulations about the wonderful 50th anniversary \u2014 which is wonderful \u2014 but we feel like Lyndon Johnson did it and we don\u2019t have to do anything anymore,\u201d said Mr. Carter, who is 89.\n\nMr. Clinton hit a somber note at times. He said Mr. Johnson \u201csaw limitless possibilities in the lives of other poor people like him who just happened to have a different color skin.\u201d\n\nVernon E. Jordan Jr., who worked with Johnson, introduced Mr. Clinton, his longtime friend. Mr. Jordan called the civil rights legislation \u201cthe bill of the century\u201d and Mr. Clinton \u201cthe Bill of the century.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Jordan first met Mr. Clinton in 1973. \u201cHe returned home to the South because he understood that when it came to race there was work to be done,\u201d Mr. Jordan said. He said Mr. Clinton joked that back then, \u201cWho would have thought that I\u2019d end up in Harlem?\u201d It is now home to the former president\u2019s personal office.", "article_metadata":
