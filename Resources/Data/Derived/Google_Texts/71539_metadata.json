I don\u2019t want to feel tired all day.\u201d\n\nA regular listener, Mike had heard Fisch, a New York urologist and fertility specialist, talk about a phenomenon called \u201clow testosterone\u201d or \u201clow T.\u201d Fisch likes to say that a man\u2019s testosterone level is \u201cthe dipstick\u201d of his health; he regularly appears on programs like \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d to talk about the malaise that may coincide with low testosterone.\n\nHe is also the medical expert featured on IsItLowT.com, an informational website sponsored by AbbVie, the drugmaker behind AndroGel, the best-selling prescription testosterone gel.\n\nLike many men who have seen commercials or online quizzes about \u201clow T,\u201d Mike suspected that diminished testosterone was the cause of his lethargy. And he hoped that taking a prescription testosterone drug would make him feel more energetic.\n\nMike also said he had diabetes and high blood pressure and was 40 pounds overweight. Fisch explained that conditions like obesity might be accompanied by decreased testosterone and energy, and he urged Mike to exercise more and to lose weight. But if Mike had trouble overhauling his diet and exercise habits, Fisch said, taking testosterone might give him the boost he needed to do so.\n\n\u201cIf it gives you more energy to exercise,\u201d Fisch said of the testosterone drug, \u201cI\u2019m all for it.\u201d\n\nRecommendations like Fisch\u2019s and the marketing of low T as a common medical condition helped propel U.S. sales of testosterone gels, patches, injections and tablets to about $2 billion last year, according to IMS Health, a health care information company.\n\nIn 2002, sales were reported to be a mere $324 million; around that time, Solvay Pharmaceuticals, which was then marketing AndroGel, began using the term \u201clow T,\u201d replacing a previous euphemism for male aging, \u201candropause.\u201d\n\nToday the low-T trend is global. From 2000 to 2011, there was \u201ca major and progressive increase\u201d in testosterone use in 37 countries, according to a recent study in the Medical Journal of Australia.\n\nThis marketing juggernaut is running into mounting opposition from prominent medical researchers and industry experts. They contend that the pharmaceutical industry has vastly expanded the market for testosterone drugs to many men who may not need them and may be exposed to increased health risks by taking them.\n\nDrugmakers spent $107 million in 2012 to advertise the top brand-name testosterone drugs in the United States. That amount doesn\u2019t include marketing known as unbranded campaigns, which raise awareness of low T itself.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration closely regulates advertisements for brand-name prescription drugs but does not generally regulate unbranded campaigns.\n\nThat two-track system, says John Mack, an analyst who runs a blog called Pharma Marketing, has enabled companies to position low T as a malady with such amorphous symptoms \u2014 listlessness, increased body fat and moodiness \u2014 that it can be seen to afflict nearly all men, at least once in a while. Drugmakers also promote low-T screening quizzes directly to consumers, Mack says, to prompt men to seek prescriptions from their doctors.\n\n\u201cYou might not have the medical condition as described in the textbook,\u201d Mack explains. \u201cBut you may have low T as defined by marketing quizzes, and you go to the doctor and ask for treatment.\u201d\n\nDavid Freundel, a spokesman for AbbVie, declined requests to interview company executives. In a statement, Freundel wrote: \u201cAndroGel is approved by the FDA to treat adult men with low or no testosterone (hypogonadism) who have been diagnosed by a physician, and has more than 10 years of clinical, safety, published and post-marketing data.\u201d\n\nHe added that the company continues to finance research into the long-term effects of testosterone therapy and that its unbranded informational efforts, like the IsItLowT. com site, \u201cfollow FDA\u2019s guidance.\u201d\n\n\"The big thing is, we just don\u2019t know the long-term risk of testosterone therapy at this time. It\u2019s particularly concerning when you see the dramatic increase happening at such a large scale so quickly.\" \u2014 Jacques G. Baillargeon, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston\n\nNevertheless, some public health experts warn that the popularization of testosterone drugs is outpacing research into efficacy and possible harms. The drugs\u2019 labels warn users about the potential for sleep apnea, congestive heart failure and low sperm counts; the topical gels warn that women and children exposed to the substances could develop male characteristics like chest hair. Others have raised concerns about the potential for prostate cancer and heart attacks.\n\n\u201cThe big thing is, we just don\u2019t know the long-term risk of testosterone therapy at this time,\u201d says Jacques G. Baillargeon, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly concerning when you see the dramatic increase happening at such a large scale so quickly.\u201d\n\nFOUNTAIN OF YOUTH\n\nIn a TV commercial promoting awareness of \u201clow T,\u201d the shadow of a middle-age man sits on a bench watching his friends play basketball.\n\n\u201cFeeling like a shadow of your former self? Don\u2019t have the hops for hoops with your buddies?\u201d says the voice-over\n\nfor the spot, paid for by AbbVie. \u201cYou might have a treatable condition called low testosterone or low T.\u201d A few seconds later, presumably after the man is treated with testosterone, the shadow evaporates and a man materializes in the flesh, besuited and smiling. Cue the voice-over: \u201cStep out of the shadows.\u201d\n\nThe quest to stave off aging by manipulating testosterone is an old one.\n\nToward the end of the 19th century, the French doctor Charles-\u00c9douard Brown-S\u00e9quard began injecting himself with \u201cjuice\u201d extracted from crushed dog or guinea-pig testicles, as reported in The Lancet in 1889. Although he contended that the injections were rejuvenating, researchers came to believe that the placebo effect was at work.\n\nIn the 1920s and \u201830s, surgeons began transplanting monkey and goat testes into men, says Dr. John E. Morley, the director of endocrinology and geriatrics at the St. Louis University School of Medicine. But that fad ended quickly after one well-known surgeon implanted goat testicles into his patients, and they apparently emitted a noxious odor.\n\n\u201cThis is the hilarious history of testosterone,\u201d recounts Morley, who in the past took speaking or consulting fees from drugmakers that marketed testosterone or planned to do so. \u201cIt may not have gotten any better. But, gee whiz, it was crazy.\u201d\n\nMore than a decade ago, a Dutch pharmaceutical company, Organon BioSciences, asked Morley to devise a screening questionnaire for symptoms common to older men with low testosterone. Morley recalls the drugmaker\u2019s instructions: \u201cThey said, 'Don\u2019t make it too long and make it somewhat sexy.' \u201d\n\nIn return, he says, Organon gave $40,000 to his university for research into the effects of testosterone on muscle. Along the way, Morley\u2019s quiz acquired an official name that emphasized its intended audience was older men: the Androgen Deficiency in Aging Males (or ADAM) test.\n\nThat test has become standard fare on brand-name drug sites like androgel.com and on informational sites like IsItLowT.com.\n\nThe test has also become controversial. Most of the questions invoke symptoms so general that they could apply to many men who are clinically depressed or simply having a bad day \u2014 or even to women, says Dr. Adriane J. Fugh-Berman, an associate professor at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington.\n\n\u201cThere are tests that everyone will fail \u2014 that is the idea,\u201d says Fugh-Berman, who directs PharmedOut, a Georgetown project to educate doctors about drug marketing. \u201d 'Do you feel tired after dinner?\u2019 Depends how long after dinner. We all do eventually. It\u2019s called sleep.\u201d\n\nMorley recalls that he drafted the questionnaire in 20 minutes in the bathroom, scribbling the questions on toilet paper and giving them to his secretary to type up. He agrees that it is hardly a perfect screening tool.\n\n\u201cI have no trouble calling it a crappy questionnaire,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is not ideal.\u201d\n\nResearchers like Dr. Lisa M. Schwartz and Dr. Steven Woloshin, professors at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy & Clinical Practice, say disease promotions and quizzes do more than just worry men into visiting their doctors. The implicit message is that taking testosterone will improve men\u2019s energy and mood, the pair wrote in a recent article in JAMA Internal Medicine.\n\nALL-STAR MARKETING\n\nThis year, Medical Marketing & Media, a trade magazine, named two AbbVie executives as \u201cthe all-star large pharma marketing team of the year\u201d for promotions of AndroGel and unbranded efforts to advance low T.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt that baby boomers have proven less than shy about availing themselves of any product that they believe will increase their quality of life,\u201d the magazine said. The article lauded AbbVie\u2019s DriveForFive.com, an unbranded site that encourages men to have regular checkups and to ask their doctors about five tests, among them tests for cholesterol and blood pressure \u2014 and testosterone.\n\nFreundel of AbbVie described the effort as \u201ca national disease-awareness initiative aimed at encouraging men to take a more proactive approach to their health.\u201d\n\nCritics, however, see it as another tactic to create testosterone takers out of generally healthy men, using the kind of unbranded campaign that federal regulators don\u2019t typically police.\n\nFugh-Berman of Georgetown refers to this kind of marketing as \u201cdisease mongering.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, the Endocrine Society recommends against screening the general population. For one thing, men\u2019s testosterone levels fluctuate so wildly \u2014 depending on time of day, sleep quality, whether they just ate, whether they are taking care of a newborn and even how their favorite sports team is faring \u2014 that a single reading may not indicate a problem. And there is a lack of medical consensus on the extent to which testosterone deficiency \u201cis an important health problem.\u201d\n\nBut Fisch \u2014 the satellite radio doctor and an occasional paid speaker for AbbVie \u2014 says he remains bullish on low T.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge industry,\u201d Fisch says, \u201cand I expect it to grow even bigger.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/12/hfcov_10-crop.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Pitches about \u2018low T\u2019 hit men where they live, but may bring health risks"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd85cd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cYou might have a treatable condition called low testosterone or low T.\u201d A few seconds later, presumably after the man is treated with testosterone, the shadow evaporates and a man materializes in the flesh, besuited and smiling.\nLike many men who have seen commercials or online quizzes about \u201clow T,\u201d Mike suspected that diminished testosterone was the cause of his lethargy.\n\u201cI feel like a 70-year-old man in a 45-year-old body,\u201d Mike, from Vancouver, British Columbia, told Fisch on the live broadcast.\nBut, gee whiz, it was crazy.\u201dMore than a decade ago, a Dutch pharmaceutical company, Organon BioSciences, asked Morley to devise a screening questionnaire for symptoms common to older men with low testosterone.\nThat amount doesn\u2019t include marketing known as unbranded campaigns, which raise awareness of low T itself."}
