We fear Alzheimer\u2019s more than cancer, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and heart disease combined. And no wonder: The disease is a one-way street with no cure.\n\nThe cost of care is breathtaking. A recent study by the Rand Institute noted that the annual cost of care for someone with Alzheimer\u2019s is as high as $56,000 per family. Broadly speaking, Alzheimer\u2019s is estimated to consume annually a stunning $604 billion globally, or one percent of global GDP.\n\nRelated: 11 Reasons We Can\u2019t Ignore Alzheimer\u2019s Anymore\n\nThe Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey, done in partnership with Age Wave, indicates it\u2019s not just the costs of Alzheimer\u2019s that people find so frightening. They don\u2019t want to be a burden on their families. At $56,000 a year for care, that\u2019s a sensible fear. And at $604 billion globally, it\u2019s more than a fear and even a public health crisis \u2013 which the World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledged last year. It's the impending fiscal nightmare of our 21st century.\n\nBut the news is not all bad. Researchers and scientists are learning more about prevention strategies for Alzheimer\u2019s and ways to promote \u201cbrain health.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re also learning more about how to make care more effective, compassionate, and efficient. Fixing the \u201ccare\u201d angle may seem like a \u201csofter\u201d goal than medical breakthroughs \u2013 but it isn\u2019t. Part of what\u2019s driving people\u2019s fear of Alzheimer\u2019s is the long, burdensome journey for both patient and caregiver alike.\n\nRelated: How One Alzheimer's Family Sealed the Deal\n\nAt national public policy levels, unless and until there is the kind of innovation we achieved with the Salk vaccine for polio, for example, Alzheimer\u2019s care will still be a catastrophe.\n\nOn the brain health front, a string of recent research and meta-analyses suggest that the longtime paradigm for disease treatment \u2013 finding a \u201ccure\u201d \u2013 may not apply for Alzheimer\u2019s, at least not as we think of that traditionally. The key may be prevention strategies, which is a new way of thinking in public health terms for non-communicable diseases \u2013 and a breakthrough. We\u2019ve seen it before with communicable diseases, where improvements in sanitation, nutrition, etc., had the huge impact we've come to associate with cures.\n\nHere\u2019s how it would work for Alzheimer\u2019s: The just-released annual report by Alzheimer\u2019s Disease International (ADI) shows we can reduce risk by managing \u201cmodifiable risk factors\u201d \u2013 like diabetes and hypertension. As ADI says, \u201cWhat\u2019s good for your heart is good for your brain.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the mere tip of the iceberg. While researchers have looked for the magic formula to \u201ccure\u201d Alzheimer\u2019s, evidence is mounting that prevention may be an equally valuable angle. ADI\u2019s new report should act as a clarion call for R&D departments globally. ADI says \u201cresearch should test hypotheses on lifestyle and control of risk.\u201d This also takes us down different paths than the traditional clinical trial model, which for Alzheimer\u2019s has been less than productive to date.\n\nRelated: 30 Percent of \u2018Retirees\u2019 Would Return to Labor Force\n\nThe Karolinska Institute in Sweden has broken open doors with new research on how to slow cognitive decline with its two-year Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability, or the FINGER study. Released this summer, the study claims to be the first to show \u201cit is possible to prevent cognitive decline.\u201d The recipe: nutrition, physical exercise, cognitive training, social activities, and heart health.\n\nWhile we await a cure, part of the answer is already here: Eat well, exercise, and lead a healthier lifestyle. Yet with 36 million people suffering from dementia worldwide, it is only sensible to ask: What can be done for those already suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s?\n\nThere are three answers:\n\n\n\nFirst, experts agree the tools of prevention can also slow down rates of deterioration. Healthy diets and exercise and active cognitive engagement won\u2019t make things better \u2013 and won\u2019t prevent deterioration \u2013 but they can slow progress at earlier stages of the disease.\n\nRelated: Retirement\u2019s Magic Number Is a Moving Target\n\nSecond, technologies can help maintain independence. Could Google Glass, for example, be used for those with early-onset dementia to provide directions and reminders? Who wouldn\u2019t be willing, early on, to try facial-recognition technology to provide details of relationships that had become harder to grasp? Other technologies are in the pipeline, too, to lengthen independence.\n\nThird, improvements in care can reduce both the \u201cfear factor\u201d and the costs, even as it mitigates the deterioriation itself. This is a goal everyone can agree to, as the current costs overwhelm individual, familial, community, and national budgets. Whether $56,000 annually for the family or $604 billion globally, neither figure is sustainable. There are new models of care through such inventions as Omaha-based and globally deployed Home Instead Senior Care (HISC). As part of its advances in 21st century care, this home-based caregiving resource has an online tool for Alzheimer\u2019s caregiving that anyone can access.\n\nTo be sure, there is more to beating this awful disease than managing one\u2019s \u201cmodifiable risk factors\u201d \u2013 or inventing and implementing better care. But these shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. Prevention can be the \u201cmedical breakthrough\u201d we\u2019re too busy to notice. And when you have companies across sectors spending the time on this awful disease and joining the traditional pharma medical innovation \u2013 we can make great progress.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Blogs/Age-Reason/2014/09/16/Alzheimers-What-Retirees-Fear-Most-All", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "New research by Bank of America Merrill Lynch says that the", "title": "What Retirees Fear Most of All"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Blogs/Age-Reason/2014/09/16/Alzheimers-What-Retirees-Fear-Most-All", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "New research by Bank of America Merrill Lynch says that the", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab3b\"", "article_summary": "We fear Alzheimer\u2019s more than cancer, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and heart disease combined.\nPart of what\u2019s driving people\u2019s fear of Alzheimer\u2019s is the long, burdensome journey for both patient and caregiver alike.\nNew research by Bank of America Merrill Lynch says that the biggest fear of people in retirement is Alzheimer\u2019s.\nHere\u2019s how it would work for Alzheimer\u2019s: The just-released annual report by Alzheimer\u2019s Disease International (ADI) shows we can reduce risk by managing \u201cmodifiable risk factors\u201d \u2013 like diabetes and hypertension.\nRelated: How One Alzheimer's Family Sealed the DealAt national public policy levels, unless and until there is the kind of innovation we achieved with the Salk vaccine for polio, for example, Alzheimer\u2019s care will still be a catastrophe."}
