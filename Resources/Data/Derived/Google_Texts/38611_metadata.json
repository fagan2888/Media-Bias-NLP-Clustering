As a tax practitioner, it is now your job to not only verify that your clients have health care coverage, but also to help them determine if they are exempt from the requirement for health care coverage, and calculate the Premium Tax Credit, if it applies.\n\nWhile this is certainly an increase in learning and workload, it can result in increased revenue opportunity for accounting firms\u2019 consulting or advisory services, or those intending to expand into those areas. To help you take advantage of this shift, it\u2019s important that you have updated software tools that help your firm offer expert advice when it comes to the ACA.\n\nFor the past three years, software developers at Thomson Reuters have been part of an IRS and CMS (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services) industry working group tasked with developing FAQs that provide a consistent message regarding the complexities of the ACA for tax professionals and taxpayers. This has given us key insight into the development of our products to meet this need.\n\nWhether you\u2019re working with an individual or a small business, upgraded software tools and online resources can help you provide guidance to clients that results in a more optimal outcome when it comes to their health insurance decisions. For example, enhanced software tools can help you quickly and easily compare the penalty for not having health insurance with the cost of buying coverage for your clients. These tools can also provide clients with a worksheet detailing whether or not their coverage is affordable.\n\nOn the business side, there are payroll products that you can exercise to better advise small businesses to identify how many full-time employees they have and whether they need to provide health insurance. You can use these same tools to help those businesses make informed hiring decisions that impact their bottom line and help predict future costs.\n\nRay Busch, president of Raymond J Busch Ltd, one of the leading CPA firms in Chicago, agrees that the ACA has significantly impacted his firm\u2019s tax preparation services for both individuals and small businesses. But ACA-related software tools and payroll products have eased the transition and provided opportunities for further client support.\n\n\u201cWith the passage of the ACA, all aspects of our tax preparation services have been affected. However, because our tax and payroll software was seamlessly updated with the proper forms for ACA compliance and we subscribe to ACA-related guidance, we are able to answer questions from our clients and provide them with advice, whether they are an individual or small business,\u201d Busch said.\n\nLooking to the future, ACA compliance will become even easier for accounting firms through software products that streamline the process of data collection from insurance providers, thus eliminating the need to manually populate certain form fields.\n\nWhile navigating the ACA can be a daunting task for accountants, it\u2019s also an opportunity to showcase the value you provide and the importance you place on looking out for your clients\u2014and ACA-specific software tools will help you take advantage of that opportunity.\n\n------------------\n\nJon Baron joined the Tax & Accounting business of Thomson Reuters in 1992.
