Todd Akin (R-MO)\n\nMore than two years after former Senate candidate Todd Akin (R-MO) infamously claimed that victims of \u201clegitimate rape\u201d don\u2019t often get pregnant because \u201cthe female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down,\u201d at least one of his GOP colleagues is still finding opportunities to work in the controversial phrase.\n\nIn an interview with Mother Jones to explain his justification for introducing a bill that requires women seeking an abortion to obtain notarized consent from the man who impregnated them, Missouri State Rep. Rick Brattin (R) said that his legislation includes an exception for victims of \u201clegitimate rape.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like any rape, you have to report it, and you have to prove it,\u201d Brattin told Mother Jones, which published his comments on Wednesday. \u201cSo you couldn\u2019t just go and say, \u2018Oh yeah, I was raped,\u2019 and get an abortion. It has to be a legitimate rape\u2026 I\u2019m just saying if there was a legitimate rape, you\u2019re going to make a police report, just as if you were robbed.\u201d\n\nBrattin made an effort to distinguish his comments from Akin\u2019s, saying he was just referring to the \u201ccommon sense\u201d idea that victims of sexual assault need to \u201ctake steps to show that you were raped.\u201d\n\nMainstream conservative politicians \u2014 including Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign \u2014 also attempted to distance themselves from Akin after his \u201clegitimate rape\u201d comments sparked national backlash, saying that his views were \u201cnot reflective of the Republican Party.\u201d GOP strategists even held training sessions to teach candidates to stop making controversial comments about sexual assault.\n\nNonetheless, the idea that some rapes are more \u201clegitimate\u201d than others, and particularly the underlying assumption that sexual assaults are only valid crimes if they\u2019ve been reported to the police, is widespread. Policymakers have been writing it into our laws for years. Brattin is just the latest public official to explicitly articulate it.\n\nParticularly when abortion restrictions include rape exceptions, they\u2019re often written in a way that forces women to prove that they were \u201clegitimately\u201d sexually assaulted. This is a standard requirement for state-level bans on Medicaid funding for abortion; many states force rape victims to produce a police report in order to get their abortion covered under that particular exemption. And in 2013, when House Republicans passed a national 20-week abortion ban, it included a provision that exempted rape victims as long as they can prove they filed a report with authorities.\n\nThis pops up in legislation outside of abortion rights, too. New Mexico recently floated a bill that would have required women to prove they were \u201cforcibly raped\u201d in order to receive childcare assistance for a child resulting from sexual assault. Pennsylvania considered a similar requirement for rape victims seeking an exception to the state\u2019s cap on welfare benefits, requiring them to prove they reported the assault to the cops in order to bypass the state\u2019s benefits reduction for additional kids.\n\nSexual assault prevention experts point out that, since rape is a vastly underreported crime \u2014 the majority of them are never reported to authorities, according to RAINN \u2014 these type of policies don\u2019t work in practice. According to one study, for instance, just 37 percent of the women who qualify for eligible abortions under Medicaid\u2019s exceptions actually end up getting their procedures funded by the program.\n\nEven outside of the policy realm, there\u2019s plenty of evidence that Americans view sexual assault on somewhat of a spectrum of legitimacy. For years, activists have been trying to make the point that acquaintance rapes or date rapes are just as serious as sexual assaults perpetrated by a stranger who uses a weapon like a knife or a gun. But according to recent surveys, it\u2019s not uncommon for people to assume that date rape isn\u2019t as heinous of a crime and is actually simply the victim\u2019s fault.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "No matter how many politicians tried to distance themselves from Todd Akin, some of his views about sexual assault aren't entirely unusual.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "No matter how many politicians tried to distance themselves from Todd Akin, some of his views about sexual assault aren't entirely unusual.", "title": "Why Yet Another Lawmaker Just Used The Term \u2018Legitimate Rape\u2019", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/12/17/3604744/legitimate-rape-lawmakers/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP277920895318.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No matter how many politicians tried to distance themselves from Todd Akin, some of his views about sexual assault aren't entirely unusual.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP277920895318-321x214.jpg", "title": "Why Yet Another Lawmaker Just Used The Term \u2018Legitimate Rape\u2019", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP277920895318.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/AP277920895318.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-17T14:38:14+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd943e\"", "article_summary": "Even outside of the policy realm, there\u2019s plenty of evidence that Americans view sexual assault on somewhat of a spectrum of legitimacy.\nHealth Why Yet Another Lawmaker Just Used The Term \u2018Legitimate Rape\u2019 CREDIT: AP Photo/Charlie Riedel Former U.S. Senate candidate, Rep.
