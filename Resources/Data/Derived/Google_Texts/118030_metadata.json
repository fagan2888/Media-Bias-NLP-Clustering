Mark Udall.\n\nThe 30-second spot, which will begin airing on Tuesday, shows Gardner and his daughter Alyson on Main Street in his hometown of Yuma on the eastern plains.\n\nThe basic message: I\u2019m from a place where people have small town values and are forced to get along so I\u2019ll know how to build consensus in Washington, DC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for a new generation of leadership in the Senate,\u201d Cory Gardner said in a press release that also mentions he\u2019s been given the \u201cseal of approval\u201d from No Labels, a bipartisan consensus-focused organization (they\u2019ve said Udall could get the same \u201cimplied endorsement\u201d just by agreeing to its principles as Gardner has).\n\n\u201cGrowing up in small-town Colorado, I learned that working together and respecting the views of others is necessary for success. Career politicians in Washington have been there far too long, and their failed ideas and policies have left our economy struggling, and countless Coloradans still looking for work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for a new generation of Coloradans to lead the next generation.\u201d\n\nThe ad seeks to humanize the relatively unknown two-term congressman from Colorado\u2019s Fourth Congressional District, who\u2019s been the target of a number of attack ads already that have aimed to define him early as too conservative based mostly on his past support for Personhood (he has since disavowed the Colorado initiative but not the general concept).\n\nUdall\u2019s campaign issued a statement on Gardner\u2019s ad Monday afternoon saying that his bipartisan message doesn\u2019t match his record in Congress.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that Tea Party radical Congressman Gardner hasn\u2019t learned, it\u2019s how to get along with others,\u201d said Udall\u2019s campaign spokesperson Chris Harris. \u201cYou don\u2019t rack up the 10th most partisan Republican voting record in the House and then shut down the government if you\u2019re interested in working together to solve problems. Coloradans know that\u2019s just not how things get done.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "DENVER -- The first TV ad from Republican Congressman Cory Gardner is a simple introduction, not a scathing attacking on his opponent, Democratic U.S. Sen.
