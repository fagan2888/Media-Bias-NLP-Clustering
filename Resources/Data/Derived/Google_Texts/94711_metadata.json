Our use of herbicide-resistant crops, along with the rapid conversion of habitat to cropland, has eliminated a huge proportion of milkweed \u2014 on which monarch caterpillars are entirely dependent \u2014 from the American Midwest. And while a number of other things could be hurting the butterfly population, too, none seem to come close to the effect that loss has had.\n\nJust to be sure, researchers at the University of Guelph revisited the issue, taking a number of those potential factors, such as climate change and the loss of habitat in Mexico, into account. As Ars Technica reports, they confirmed that agriculture is the problem, much more so than the loss of habitat in Mexico:\n\nTheir conclusions suggest that we can\u2019t blame deforestation in Mexico for this environmental problem. The monarchs are suffering from a lack of milkweed, the only plant the caterpillars eat. In fact, a model built by the researchers suggested that monarch populations were four times more sensitive to the loss of milkweed on their breeding grounds than the loss of the forested habitat in which they spend the winters. The spatial model was built using population dynamics data, which incorporated locations and life stages, known survival rates at different stages, and standard reproductive success. It used this data to predict how various changes in the system, from climate to habitat, would affect the insects\u2019 complex lives. Using their model, the scientists found a 21 percent decline in milkweed abundance between 1995 and 2013. The largest declines, in the midwest, line up with the largest declines in butterfly population.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scientists confirm that the best way to save the monarchs is to plant more milkweed", "author": "Lindsay Abrams", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Scientists confirm that the best way to save the monarchs is to plant more milkweed", "title": "Monsanto vs. the monarchs: More evidence that Big Ag is killing our butterflies", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/06/monsanto_vs_the_monarchs_continued_more_evidence_that_modern_agriculture_is_killing_the_butterflies/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/shutterstock_104490380.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scientists confirm that the best way to save the monarchs is to plant more milkweed", "creator": "@readingirl", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/shutterstock_104490380.jpg", "title": "Monsanto vs. the monarchs: More evidence that Big Ag is killing our butterflies", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Monsanto vs. the monarchs: More evidence that Big Ag is killing our butterflies", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, GMO, herbicides, monarch butterflies, Monsanto", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8add\"", "article_summary": "Topics: GMO, herbicides, monarch butterflies, Monsanto, Sustainability NewsIf you read Salon\u2019s interview last weekend with Chip Taylor of Monarch Watch, you already know that modern agriculture is no friend to the monarch butterfly.\nThe largest declines, in the midwest, line up with the largest declines in butterfly population.\nAnd while a number of other things could be hurting the butterfly population, too, none seem to come close to the effect that loss has had.\nThe spatial model was built using population dynamics data, which incorporated locations and life stages, known survival rates at different stages, and standard reproductive success.\nUsing their model, the scientists found a 21 percent decline in milkweed abundance between 1995 and 2013."}
