Mary Fallin released 31 documents Monday that her office had withheld from a major public records release concerning her decisions about the Affordable Care Act. Political and pragmatic concerns take center stage in the newly released emails.\n\nOn Nov. 14, 2012, Fallin press secretary Alex Weintz sent an email to Katie Altshuler, the governor\u2019s policy director, and Denise Northrup, the governor\u2019s chief of staff. Weintz discussed whether the governor should abandon her support for setting up a state health care exchange for people to select insurance.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion the two choices that make the most sense are: State exchanges can be good if done right so we are going to build one OR Obamacare sucks, we aren\u2019t going to help implement it and we aren\u2019t creating an exchange,\u201d Weintz said in the email.\n\n\u201cSince there is no way the legislature is going to allow us to do the former, I suggest we do the latter.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the governor decided against setting up a state exchange. People in Oklahoma instead use one set up by the federal government.\n\nResponding to public records requests, Fallin\u2019s office in March 2013 released more than 51,000 pages of documents about her approach to the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare.\n\nShe withheld 31 documents totaling 100 pages. Her general counsel, Steven Mullins, said those pages were exempt from the state Open Records Act on the grounds of executive privilege, deliberative process privilege and attorney-client privilege.\n\nThe decision to withhold documents was challenged in court. A judge ruled June 17 that the governor could withhold the documents under a deliberative process privilege.\n\nOn Monday, Mullins said the governor had decided to voluntarily waive the privilege and release the documents because the court affirmed the privilege, the documents have become less sensitive and she believes in transparency and openness.\n\nThe documents that were released shed light on the inner workings of the governor\u2019s office.\n\nIn 2012, the governor\u2019s office was considering whether to expand Medicaid, as envisioned under Obamacare, with the federal government picking up much of the early expense.\n\nState Sen. Patrick Anderson, R-Enid, was strongly against this and issued a news release on July 3, 2012, urging Fallin to \u201cbe on the front line with those governors who have already announced they won\u2019t submit to the federal health care law.\u201d\n\nThe same day as Anderson\u2019s news release, Weintz sent Northrup an email at 4:43 p.m. saying the governor had decided against Medicaid expansion.\n\nNorthrup wrote back at 5:39 p.m.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. I just don\u2019t know why we\u2019d rush into a decision like that. I hardly think the political pressure of Patrick Anderson is worth jumping into a decision like that.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Weintz wrote:\n\n\u201cThe longer we wait, the more it looks like we are getting bullied by people like Patrick Anderson.\u201d\n\nIn the 2011 legislative session, Fallin was backing a bill to set up a health care exchange. Ultimately, the Oklahoma Senate refused to take it up.\n\nBefore that, votes were being counted by her then-legislative liaison, Kaleb Bennett.\n\nIn a March 25, 2011, email, Bennett counted 14 ayes, nine nays and three undecided.\n\nTea Party pressure and political considerations figured into some of the nays, he said in the email.\n\nOne of those nays, Sen. Josh Brecheen, R-Coalgate, \u201cthinks it\u2019s political suicide,\u201d Bennett wrote.\n\nAnother nay, Sen. Rick Brinkley, R-Owasso, \u201cfeels like he has to throw some kind of bone to his Tea Party crowd but understands the situation. Wants to help but for now a hard no.\u201d\n\nTwo other nays \u2014 Sen. Mike Mazzei, R-Tulsa, and Sen. Dan Newberry, R-Tulsa \u2014 felt the issue was \u201ctoo hot politically.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Senate President Pro Tem Brian Bingman announced the bill would not be heard, even though Bennett, in his vote count, had included him among those in support.\n\nThe earlier document release included a single-word email from Northrup when she found out the bill had died: \u201cDammit (sic).\u201d\n\nIn an interview Monday, Weintz said that even though most of the emails released by the governor\u2019s office discussed messaging and the politics behind Obamacare, the merits of the act and what it would mean for uninsured Oklahomans were discussed, but these discussions typically took place in cabinet meetings as opposed to email exchanges.\n\n\u201cGenerally what you can see from all of the emails is that it was an important decision, one we were taking seriously and deliberating in person,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spent months as an office talking about this.\u201d\n\nEditor's note: You can read and/or download the emails in PDF form below.\n\nGov.
