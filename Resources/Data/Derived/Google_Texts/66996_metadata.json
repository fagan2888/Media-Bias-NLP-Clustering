A team of MIT engineers believe they may have found the answer to the world\u2019s water crisis with a design they claim can harnass the power of the sun to make salt water drinkable.\n\nDesalination, or removing salt from water, is already a popular practice in areas prone to droughts. Unfortunately, the process is expensive and wasteful \u2014 two components that make it ineffective for third world countries, Popular Science reported.\n\nIn order to help address the problem, USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development, set up a competition to find the most cost-effective and enviromental desalination process for developing countries. Amos Winter, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, and Natasha Wright, a doctoral student, emerged as the winners with their solar-run electrodialysis method.\n\nIn the technique, dissolved salt, which naturally has a slight electric charge, is drawn out of the water with an electrical current. The technique also disinfects the water by shining it with a UV light, PopSci reported. \u201cIt works kind of like an electric circuit,\u201d Wright explained to The Boston Globe. \u201cThe ions get pulled out of the water toward the electrodes.\u201d\n\nWhile electrodialysis is a well understood practice, what makes the design significant is its use of solar power. The entire machine is run by solar-charged battery panels. Most desalination techniques run on fossil-fuel, which makes them both expensive to run and detrimental for the environment. Using solar panels eliminates both of these negative attributes.\n\nThe MIT design is also far less wasteful than typical desalination processes. Reverse osmosis is the most common way to draw salt out of water, but according to Wright, this technique can waste around 40 percent of the water used. The solar-run electrodialysis discards only about five percent of the water used, The Globe reported.\n\nThe team won the first prize of $140,000 to test their method. The technique has so far been tested for its durability, an important factor for its use in poor rural areas. A machine which requires constant expensive upkeep would be out of the budget for many communities. The technique proved successful after being run for 24 hours straight at the Brackish Groundwater National Desalination Research Facility in New Mexico. As reported by PopSci, the next step is to see how the method performs in harsh environments and after constant use.\n\nAlthough the technique is not yet available for practical use, if it proves effective it could be a major stepping stone in the effort to provide the world with usable water. In areas like India the population vastly supersedes the amount of safe, drinkable water. But the current drought in California has brought the problem of water shortages closer to home for some.\n\nAccording to Glenn Vicevic, a product manager at General Electric\u2019s Co.\u2019s power and water business unit in Oakville, Canada, there\u2019s no reason for the design to not work correctly.\n\n\u201cElectrodialysis technology is well understood,\u201d Vicevic told The Globe. \u201cIf you combine that with properly sized solar cells and you have properly sized batteries, there\u2019s no reason you couldn\u2019t achieve it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "water shortage, solar power, desalination, electrodialysis", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A team of engineers from MIT believe their solar-powered desalination technique may help address the world's water shortage.", "title": "MIT Uses Solar Power To Make Salt Water Drinkable", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/water-shortage-problem-solved-solar-power-mit-makes-salt-water-drinkable-330684", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/24/water-jug.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A team of engineers from MIT believe their solar-powered desalination technique may help address the world's water shortage.", "title": "MIT Uses Solar Power To Make Salt Water Drinkable", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/water-shortage-problem-solved-solar-power-mit-makes-salt-water-drinkable-330684", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/24/water-jug.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/24/water-jug.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-04-24T15:53:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-24T15:53:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A team of engineers from MIT believe their solar-powered desalination technique may help address the world's water shortage."}, "article_summary": "A team of MIT engineers believe they may have found the answer to the world\u2019s water crisis with a design they claim can harnass the power of the sun to make salt water drinkable.\n\u201cThe ions get pulled out of the water toward the electrodes.\u201dWhile electrodialysis is a well understood practice, what makes the design significant is its use of solar power.\nDesalination, or removing salt from water, is already a popular practice in areas prone to droughts.\nIn the technique, dissolved salt, which naturally has a slight electric charge, is drawn out of the water with an electrical current.\nThe MIT design is also far less wasteful than typical desalination processes."}
