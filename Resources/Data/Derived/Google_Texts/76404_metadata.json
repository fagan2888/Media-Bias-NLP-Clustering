But the union that represents forecasters says forecasters covered the storms with the help of meteorologists who volunteered to come in from home and managers pulling extra duty.\n\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth National Weather Service office currently has three vacant front-line forecaster positions. The meteorologist who serves as the union representative for the DFW area office says Saturday\u2019s storms highlight the urgent need to fill those jobs.\n\n\u201cThis office needs to be fully staffed. We shouldn\u2019t have to be spending time trying to find people to cover shifts and do surveys after high impact weather,\u201d said local National Weather Service Employees Organization representative Jason Dunn.\n\n\u201cWe serve more than 8 million people.
