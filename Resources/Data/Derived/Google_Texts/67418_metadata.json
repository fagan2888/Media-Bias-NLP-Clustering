He went from the meet-and-greet in east Orange to a town-hall meeting with small-business owners in Longwood and later a rally in Maitland.\n\nIn various speeches throughout the day, Bush said he wanted to repeal the Affordable Care Act to help small businesses and declared his opposition to the new Iran and Cuba deals, calling the Iran deal \"horrific.\"\n\nHe embraced school choice and creating a path to legalized status for most of the United States' 11 million illegal immigrants and vowed tax and regulatory reforms that he said would lead to 4 percent annual growth. He also offered assurances he would offer protection worldwide against persecution of Christians.\n\nOn Puerto Rico, he noted that he has worked on the island and visited often. Bush said he supports statehood but said the financial crisis must be solved first.\n\nFlorida is home to an estimated 900,000 Puerto Ricans, and about a third of them live in Central Florida. That makes the Puerto Rican vote valuable to any candidate who wants to win the region, considered crucial to any candidate seeking to carry Florida.\n\nBush also called for campaign and government civility and said he refused to speak ill of his opponents. He even deflected questions that gave him opportunities to respond to criticism from the GOP front-runner Donald Trump.\n\nHe vowed his campaign would focus on the positive.\n\n\"I'm a committed conservative. But I'm not angry. I believe we're on the verge of the greatest time to be alive,\" he said.\n\nBut he did strongly criticize the policies of both President Barack Obama and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"Mrs. Clinton is running for a third term of economic policy that has failed this country,\" Bush said in Maitland. \"Today she is advocating higher taxes. \u2026 People are stuck in jobs because they fear that they may lose their health-care insurance, and that's why we have this kind of tepid economic growth.''\n\nDemocrats were quick to poke him back. His tour of Central Florida had been billed as a Hispanic campaign event, though Hispanic supporters were a small minority at the Maitland stop.\n\n\"Bush's failed policies will devastate Hispanic communities,\" said Pablo Manriquez, the Democratic National Committee's director of Hispanic media. He cited Bush's opposition to a minimum-wage increase, to the Affordable Care Act and, as governor, to Florida's class-size reduction initiative.\n\nBush offered his pledge for comprehensive immigration reform at every stop, garnering different reactions. His proposal drew warm applause in east Orange and applause in Longwood, but complete silence in Maitland, even though the Maitland crowd of about 150 had been the rowdiest of all during other parts of his speech.\n\nIn east Orange, in answering a question, he declared, \"We need to have a path to legal status for the 11 million people here. It's the logical thing when you think about it, because what else would you do?\n\n\"The idea of self-deportation or the idea of rounding people up is not an American value,\" he said.\n\nBush picked up endorsements from former U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez, state Rep. Bob Cortes of Longwood and Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs, who said she had not endorsed any major-office candidate since Martinez ran in 2004.\n\n\"I got to see firsthand how Governor Bush led our state with integrity and put in place conservative policies that really made a difference for Florida families,\" Jacobs said.\n\nsmpowers@tribune.com or 407-420-5441", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Jeb Bush calls for financial help for Puerto Rico", "date": "2015-07-27", "Description": "On his first official foray into Central Florida as a presidential candidate, Jeb Bush called Monday for debt restructuring relief for Puerto Rico, while declaring himself as the positive GOP choice for the job.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "On his first official foray into Central Florida as a presidential candidate, Jeb Bush called Monday for debt relief for Puerto Rico, while declaring himself the positive Republican choice for the nation's top job.", "title": "Jeb Bush calls for financial help for Puerto Rico", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/os-jeb-bush-central-florida-visit-20150727-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55b6c490/turbine/os-jeb-bush-central-florida-visit-20150727", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp14.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/84087041", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "y_key": "fb73650ad672fe45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "googlebot": "index"}, "article_summary": "Speaking to about 75 mostly Puerto Rican religious leaders in east Orange County, Florida's former governor said the island's financial crisis must be addressed.\nFlorida is home to an estimated 900,000 Puerto Ricans, and about a third of them live in Central Florida.\nOn his first official foray into Central Florida as a presidential candidate, Jeb Bush called Monday for debt relief for Puerto Rico, while declaring himself the positive Republican choice for the nation's top job.\nIn east Orange, in answering a question, he declared, \"We need to have a path to legal status for the 11 million people here.\nBush made three stops in a campaign tour of Central Florida."}
