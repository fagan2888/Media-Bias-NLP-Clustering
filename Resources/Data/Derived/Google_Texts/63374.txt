The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a request to unseal transcripts and files in the death penalty case against Sir Mario Owens.

The case and files have been sealed for more than six years. The high court announced its decision not to hear the request on Monday.

Owens was sentenced to death in 2008 for killing Vivian Wolfe and Javad Marshall-Fields in Aurora in June 2005. Marshall-Fields was set to testify against Owen’s friend, Robert Ray, in a different murder case.

Ray was also sentenced to death for Wolfe’s and Marshall-Fields’ deaths.

Both Wolfe and Marshall-Fields were 21 when they were killed.

Attorney Steve Zansberg, who represents several media organizations including The Denver Post, has filed a motion in Arapahoe County District Court — where the case was originally tried — to unseal the case.
