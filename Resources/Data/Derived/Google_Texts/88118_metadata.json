We are working through a few bits of text,\u201d said Rep. Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican who is a leader in the pro-life movement and chief sponsor of the taxpayer funding bill.\n\nSEE ALSO: March for Life will coincide with House vote on abortion\n\nGOP leaders are eager to try to pass some abortion restrictions through the House on Thursday because it\u2019s the same day as the annual March for Life, timed to coincide with the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision establishing a national right to abortion.\n\nThe 20-week abortion ban bill, titled the \u201cPain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,\u201d would have established a national ban on abortions after 20 weeks, which is the time at which the bill declared fetuses are able to feel pain.\n\nThe legislation included limited exceptions for pregnancies that were the result of rape or incest or that were necessary to prevent the mother\u2019s life from being endangered. But the rape and incest exceptions only applied to reported cases of those sex crimes.\n\nWinning passage of that legislation had been a priority of pro-life groups, but divisions within the GOP appeared to have doomed it. Two Republican women who signed onto the legislation two weeks ago withdrew as sponsors of the bill on Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats said the episode showed Republicans are in disarray.\n\n\u201cThe bill led to a meltdown in your conference, and you realized you couldn\u2019t get even a simple majority on the House floor,\u201d said Rep. Jim McGovern, Massachusetts Democrat, who said the GOP was suffering for speeding the original bill to the floor without putting it through the usual committee process.\n\nNow, the bill the House will vote on Thursday is designed to push back against parts of Obamacare that Republicans say can still allow taxpayer funds to pay for federally-backed health plans that cover abortion.\n\nA similar bill passed the House in 2014 on a 227-188 vote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Facing yet another internal division, Republican leaders scratched a planned Thursday vote on a bill banning abortions at 20 weeks and said they would replace it with a bill designed to eliminate taxpayer funding for abortions.", "Author": "Stephen Dinan", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Facing yet another internal division, Republican leaders scratched a planned Thursday vote on a bill banning abortions at 20 weeks and said they would replace it with a bill designed to eliminate taxpayer funding for abortions.", "title": "House nixes fetal-pain abortion vote, substitutes anti-Obamacare bill instead", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/21/house-nixes-fetal-pain-abortion-vote-substitutes-a/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/18/81e4da8bea3f9d026b0f6a7067001253.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/18/81e4da8bea3f9d026b0f6a7067001253.jpg", "title": "House nixes fetal-pain abortion vote, substitutes anti-Obamacare bill", "description": "Facing yet another internal division, Republican leaders scratched a planned Thursday vote on a bill banning abortions at 20 weeks and said they would replace it with a bill designed to eliminate taxp", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Politics, Republican Party"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdefbd\"", "article_summary": "A similar bill passed the House in 2014 on a 227-188 vote.\nTwo Republican women who signed onto the legislation two weeks ago withdrew as sponsors of the bill on Tuesday.\nNow, the bill the House will vote on Thursday is designed to push back against parts of Obamacare that Republicans say can still allow taxpayer funds to pay for federally-backed health plans that cover abortion.\nThe 20-week abortion ban bill, titled the \u201cPain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,\u201d would have established a national ban on abortions after 20 weeks, which is the time at which the bill declared fetuses are able to feel pain.\nFacing yet another internal division, Republican leaders night scratched a planned Thursday vote on a bill banning abortions at 20 weeks and replaced it with a bill designed to eliminate taxpayer funding for abortions."}
