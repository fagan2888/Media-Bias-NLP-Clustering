The risk is based on the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology calculator, which takes into account cholesterol and blood pressure(bit.ly/1VXp8n3).\n\nFor at-risk people aged 60 to 69 years, the guidelines say the benefit is not as large compared to people ages 50 to 59 years, and decisions to take aspirin should be made on a case by case basis.\n\nThe group said it did not have enough data to determine whether people aged 50 or younger and people aged 70 or older should take daily low-dose aspirin.\n\n\"Overall, the USPSTF did a really thorough job \" said Dr. Mark Creager, president of the American Heart Association. \"I think they're right on target in how they evaluated the data, what their recommendation was, who was involved and the grade of the recommendation.\"\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, the task force's recommendations are used to help set health insurance reimbursement policies.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Seaman; Editing by Caroline Humer and Frances Kerry)", "article_metadata": {"DCSext.ContentID_healthNews": "USKCN0RE2A120150914", "sailthru.author": "Andrew  M.
