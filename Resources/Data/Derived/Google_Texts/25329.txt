As Obamacare enters its third year, we’re getting a clearer picture of how the landmark health insurance law is faring in a state that’s been extraordinarily hostile to it. The good news: From 2013 to 2014, the percentage of Texans without insurance dropped from about 22 percent to 19 percent. The bad news: Texas remains No. 1 in the nation for the total number of uninsured (more than 5 million) and has the highest rate of uninsured. A closer look shows that some areas, especially urban counties, are making a big dent in the number of uninsured, while others have low enrollment rates and stubbornly high uninsured rates.
