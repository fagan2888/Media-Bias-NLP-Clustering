But what if KFC or El Pollo Loco had the power to quash Chick-fil-A\u2019s Nevada plans on the premise that the new competition might be bad for the bottom line?\n\nThe scenario may sound absurd, yet it\u2019s hardly outrageous when it comes to Nevada\u2019s transportation industry, much of which operates under an antiquated regulatory framework that suppresses innovation and restricts competition to protect the profits of established interests. Unfortunately, a bipartisan legislative effort to reform this hidebound setup for the benefit of both entrepreneurs and consumers died last week at the hands of Gov. Brian Sandoval.\n\nUnder current state law, those seeking to start a taxi or limousine business, tow-truck firm, moving company or other motor carrier enterprise must first obtain a \u201ccertificate of public convenience and necessity\u201d from the Nevada Transportation Authority. (Clark County has its own regulatory board to oversee the taxi industry.) In order to grant such a certificate, however, the authority must conclude that a new business will \u201cnot unreasonably and adversely affect other carriers\u201d already operating in the same territory.\n\nThe law goes so far as to allow existing companies \u2014 citing potentially undesirable economic consequences \u2014 to \u201cintervene\u201d in the licensing hearing of a prospective competitor or a current rival seeking to expand its operation.\n\nThis protectionist approach represents an attack on consumer choice and entrepreneurialism while inadvisably empowering the bureaucracy to make decisions that are better left to the marketplace. Would Las Vegas burger lovers have Five Guys or In-N-Out to enjoy if a similar anti-competitive regulatory apparatus governed Nevada fast-food outlets?\n\nSenate Bill 183, a bipartisan measure that passed the state Senate unanimously and the Assembly by a comfortable 26-16 margin, would have created a more equitable system for overseeing motor carriers. Among other things, the bill would have dropped existing language from the statute that directs the Nevada Transportation Authority to deny any applications that \u201cwould tend to increase or create competition that may be detrimental.\u201d\n\nBut on June 9, Gov. Sandoval vetoed SB183. The authority\u2019s \u201cability to consider the economic viability of a motor carrier operator,\u201d he explained in his veto message, \u201cis an important factor in evaluating whether that operator has the necessary resources to transport members of the public safely and can maintain industry safety standards.\u201d\n\nWhile the governor\u2019s concern for the well-being of the traveling public is admirable, it is misplaced in this context. Nothing in SB183 limited the authority\u2019s role in promoting consumer welfare. The bill did not alter the fact that the state, counties and municipalities retain the power to enact and enforce safety regulations governing motor carriers. In fact, the legislation expressly allowed existing interests to \u201cintervene\u201d during hearings if they had concerns regarding an applicant\u2019s ability to operate safely.\n\nMore likely, SB183 became a victim of political backscratching in an effort to placate the state\u2019s limo and cab operators, who vigorously opposed legislation signed by Gov. Sandoval that paves the way for ride-sharing outfits such as Uber to operate in Nevada.\n\nWhile legislative reform will now have to wait until at least the next session in 2017, the issue remains pertinent.\n\nIn February, a small Reno limo company and a California-based moving company teamed with the Pacific Legal Foundation to file suit in federal court challenging the state\u2019s method of awarding transportation operating certificates. Danell Wilson-Perlman, owner of Reno-Tahoe Limousine, maintains that the process stymies her efforts to keep up with consumer demand by forcing her to receive permission from her competitors before she is allowed to add vehicles to her fleet.\n\nA Pacific Legal Foundation attorney leading the challenge to the law on due process grounds noted that the issue has \u201cabsolutely nothing to do with safety and everything to do with a competitor\u2019s veto.\u201d\n\nAmen. Nevada consumers and entrepreneurs deserve better. If Gov. Sandoval won\u2019t recognize that, perhaps the judicial system will.\n\nLas Vegas resident John Kerr, former editorial page editor of the Review-Journal, is a communications fellow with the Institute for Justice, a public-interest law firm based in Arlington, Va.
