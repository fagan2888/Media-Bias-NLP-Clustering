The organization\u2019s homepage now features stark \u201cGoodbye and Good Luck Oregon\u201d and \u201cNo Health Republic Insurance Company health policies remain in effect\u201d messages. It continues to operate to pay claims made against policies issued during 2014 and 2015.\n\nRisk corridors were included in the ACA as a three-year transition strategy to assure insurance companies they wouldn\u2019t lose money by offering policies through the new healthcare exchanges established under the law. The transition strategy was deemed necessary because there were no actuarial bases for determining the cost of insurance using the new terms established for the exchanges under the ACA. However, rather than covering all losses, risk corridor payments fell short by more than $2.5 billion in the first year, and the shortage is expected to be even higher in 2015. The payment shortage, coupled with the severe losses experienced by many health insurance companies, have caused some to cease offering policies in the exchanges.\n\nThe risk corridor payment shortages can be blamed on insurance companies miscalculating the true cost of providing policies in the exchanges, resulting in higher losses and fewer profitable insurers making payments into the risk corridor fund. Another reason for the shortfalls was Congress passed legislation in 2014 forbidding the federal government to use funds other than risk corridor revenues to make risk corridor payments.\n\nHealth Republic is seeking full payment for itself and all other insurance companies that were eligible for risk corridor relief in both 2014 and 2015. Proceeds from the lawsuit could be used to discharge debts owed by the insurance cooperatives to the federal government, including $60 million in loans owed by Health Republic.\u2014Michael Wyland", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oregon-based Health Republic Insurance Company has filed a class action lawsuit against the feds, seeking to recover as much as $5 billion in \u201crisk corridor\u201d payments promised to insurers as part of the Affordable Care Act.", "original-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/03/03/health-insurer-sues-for-billions-in-lost-federal-payments/", "og": {"site_name": "Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly", "description": "Oregon-based Health Republic Insurance Company has filed a class action lawsuit against the feds, seeking to recover as much as $5 billion in \u201crisk corridor\u201d payments promised to insurers as part of the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Health Insurer Sues for Billions in Lost Federal Payments", "url": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/03/03/health-insurer-sues-for-billions-in-lost-federal-payments/", "image": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/56/files/2010/10/newswire_icon19.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@npquarterly", "card": "summary", "creator": "@mlwyland"}, "syndication-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/03/03/health-insurer-sues-for-billions-in-lost-federal-payments/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News, Policy,  health insurance market,  Obamacare,  risk taking, Affordable Care Act, Co-ops, cooperatives, Healthcare"}, "article_summary": "Another reason for the shortfalls was Congress passed legislation in 2014 forbidding the federal government to use funds other than risk corridor revenues to make risk corridor payments.\nThe organization\u2019s homepage now features stark \u201cGoodbye and Good Luck Oregon\u201d and \u201cNo Health Republic Insurance Company health policies remain in effect\u201d messages.\nHealth Republic was one of 23 health insurance \u201cconsumer-oriented and operated plans,\u201d or CO-OPs, established under the ACA as a nonprofit, \u201cpublic option\u201d alternative insurance provider on the health insurance exchanges.\nHealth Republic is seeking full payment for itself and all other insurance companies that were eligible for risk corridor relief in both 2014 and 2015.\nHowever, rather than covering all losses, risk corridor payments fell short by more than $2.5 billion in the first year, and the shortage is expected to be even higher in 2015."}
