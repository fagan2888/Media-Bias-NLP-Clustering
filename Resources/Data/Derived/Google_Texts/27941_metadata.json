Data exclusivity prevents follow-on pharmaceutical developers from relying on originators\u2019 test data submitted for marketing approval while seeking such approval for its own product. The World Trade Organization\u2019s (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) requires some protection against unfair competition for this sort of data, but it does not require countries to adopt rules conveying exclusive rights over it in the same way as it does regarding patents.[3] Currently, the US provides 12 years of exclusivity for new biological products under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA).[4] The provision providing 12 years exclusivity was buried inside the 20,000-page healthcare law, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. A robust debate over what would be an appropriate exclusivity period, if any, was overshadowed by other controversial aspects of the bill commonly referred to as Obamacare.\n\nThere is much confusion surrounding the statutory interpretation of the BPCIA. Many scholarly articles and blog posts as well as industry-funded sources state that the United States allows for 12 years of data exclusivity. However, this is not the case. The law actually provides only four years of data exclusivity for biologic drugs, while the remaining eight years function as market exclusivity.[5] This distinction is important \u2013 if biologics truly had 12 years of data exclusivity in the US, the FDA would not be able to consider a biosimilar application for 12 years, which would, in turn, provide the innovator with up to 13-14 years of market monopoly before a biosimilar could be approved and enter the market. Rather, after four years a developer may file an application under the BPCIA for a biosimilar, but such a biosimilar application would not be eligible for approval until the 12-year period has elapsed.\n\nIssues surrounding the exclusivity afforded to biologics in the US are still in need of robust debate and there are members in Congress that are against this extensive period of protection.[6] The Federal Trade Commission said in a 2009 study that 12 years is \u201cunnecessary\u201d to convince companies to invest in biologics.[7] Every administration budget proposal since then has called for the window of exclusivity to be reduced from 12 years to seven years[8] to foster greater biosimilar competition and reduce the cost burden on patients and payers associated with these drugs.[9] In addition to reducing the period of data and marketing exclusivity, the President\u2019s 2016 budget proposes \u201cprohibiting additional periods of exclusivity for brand biologics due to minor changes in product formulations.\u201d[10] The Administration projects that these two provisions would save the federal government $16 billion over the next 10 years.[11] Savings accrued through such policies would likely be even larger in subsequent years.\n\nMeanwhile, separate from these domestic discussions, TPP trade ministers will be on a Hawaiian island this week hashing out whether the agreement should contain a 12-, eight- or five-year exclusivity period (or no special period at all).[12] In late 2013, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) proposed 12 years of exclusivity (which functions as marketing exclusivity rather than data exclusivity) for biologics in the TPP, even though this contradicts and is mutually exclusive with the Administration\u2019s domestic policy proposals.[13]\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry lobby insists that it needs 12 years of exclusivity in the TPP to recover research and development costs associated with biologic drug discovery.[14] But this perspective is not shared by many beyond the industry and its backers. The US is the only country among those negotiating the TPP with 12 years of exclusivity. Japan, which is often the US\u2019s partner in submitting harmful pharmaceutical proposals, provides eight years market exclusivity for pharmaceutical products without distinguishing between small molecule and biologics drugs. Other members of the TPP such as Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Chile provide five years exclusivity for biologics; the same as small molecules. It is unlikely these countries will submit to US demands to increase their exclusivity periods to 12 years through the TPP.\n\nThe current negotiating table debate centers on a five- or eight-year period of exclusivity, not 12. Eight years of exclusivity is not a compromise position; it would be a major change to 9 of the 12 countries\u2019 laws, and all of those countries oppose such a change\n\nA country\u2019s market size is the most significant factor in pharmaceutical industry decisions regarding how quickly to seek registration of their products in a given market. Yet some pharmaceutical industry lobbyists are arguing that longer exclusivity periods would reduce their drug submission lag, supposedly incentivizing them to bring products to market sooner.[15]. We debunk this claim in a new report, based on surveys of the industry itself.[16]\n\nEight years of exclusivity would keep biologic medicines out of the hands of many who need them. Prices frequently exceed $100,000.[17] In the United States, for patients with insurance, biologic medications are often classified as \u201cspecialty\u201d medications, and often the consumer is forced to pay upwards of 20-30 percent of the cost of the medication.[18] According to AARP, which has taken a public stance against long terms of exclusivity, shortening the period of exclusivity in the US would be \u201ca critical element of any comprehensive effort to contain healthcare costs,\u201d since \u201cbiosimilars [are priced] 40 percent lower than their brand-name counterparts.[19] Locking eight years of exclusivity (even it is shorter than 12 years) into the TPP would still prevent adequate reforms in the US, and force other TPP countries with less resources to adopt a policy that a rich country like the US can scarcely afford. In other TPP countries, like Vietnam, where pharmaceutical procurement accounts for half of overall health spending, this could spell disaster for patients and government payers.[20]\n\nThe cost of extended exclusivity is not only monetary. Extended monopolies can threaten innovation, which relies on prior knowledge, with progress measured by the next innovation, not the last.[21] Therefore, policies that lengthen the time of exclusivity may actually reduce the pace of innovation because it stifles discovery of new or improved biologic treatments.[22] Kenneth Arrow, a Nobel laureate in economics, has argued that \u201cthe incentive to invent is less under monopolistic than under competitive conditions\u201d reaching the conclusion that monopolists don\u2019t innovate.[23]\n\nAs TPP negotiators and trade ministers gather in Maui to attempt to resolve these contentious issues and others, they should be mindful of the devastating effects that excessive periods of exclusivity can have on patient access and future innovation. TPP negotiators already have achieved success in pushing back against some of the harmful pharmaceutical rules being advanced by USTR at the behest of the brand name pharmaceutical industry. An eight year exclusivity period, though shorter than USTR\u2019s initial outlandish ask, would still be a damaging outcome from a public health perspective. Eight years is three to eight more years of exclusivity than most TPP countries currently provide, and would thus delay access to affordable treatments. Enshrining it in the TPP would be a major victory for the brand-name industry, but damaging to the health of those living in the region as well as the future of innovation. Negotiators and trade ministers should stand firm against this industry demand.\n\n[1] Public Citizen\u2019s Global Access to Medicines Program\n\n[2] Randi Hernandez, Patent Exclusivity for Biologics: Seven or Twelve Years?, BioPharm International (Jan. 30, 2015), available at http://www.biopharminternational.com/patent-exclusivity-biologics-seven-or-twelve-years?rel=canonical.\n\n[3] Id.\n\n[4] See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7262, Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/ucm216146.pdf.\n\n[5] Id. at \u00a7262(k)\n\n[6] See Rep.
