Credit: Associated Press\n\nBy\n\nTimothy Peters won the Truck Series race at Talladega Superspeedway for the second consecutive year.\n\nPeters was second on the final restart Saturday after a multitruck accident caused a stoppage of 15 minutes for the track to be cleaned. Brandon Jones got a terrific jump as the leader, but he pulled too far away from the line of trucks behind him in the bottom lane.\n\nIt allowed Peters, in the top lane, to catch Jones and pull past Jones for the lead. Then Spencer Gallagher tried to duck down and attempt to pass Peters, but he was hooked by John Wes Townley to bring out a race-ending caution.\n\nPole winner:Jeff Gordon has won the pole for his final race at Talladega Superspeedway.\n\nGordon led a Hendrick Motorsports domination in Saturday qualifying at the 2.66-mile superspeedway, where he and teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. both need strong runs to advance into the third round of the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship.\n\nFour drivers will be cut from the Chase field after Sunday's race. Gordon is seventh in the standings, while Earnhardt is 11th in the 12-driver field. Both drivers are six-time winners at Talladega, and Earnhardt won the spring race there.\n\nGordon was followed in qualifying by teammates Kasey Kahne and Jimmie Johnson. Matt Kenseth, a Cambridge, Wis., native who is last in the Chase field, qualified fourth. Earnhardt was fifth.\n\nFormula One: Lewis Hamilton posted the fastest time in the final practice session at the United States Grand Prix in Austin, Texas, as another day of harsh weather pounded the track with hours of rain.\n\nAfter a three-hour delay, race officials decided to push off qualifying until a rare Sunday morning session before the afternoon race.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Timothy Peters trucks on at Talladega", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/sports/autoracing/timothy-peters-trucks-on-at-talladega-b99602897z1-336745261.html", "image": {"width": 1299, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99602897z.1_20151024220927_000_gaud2rsc.1-1.jpg", "height": 812}, "type": "article", "description": "Timothy Peters won the Truck Series race at Talladega Superspeedway for the second consecutive year.
