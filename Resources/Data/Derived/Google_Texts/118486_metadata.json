He became the council member for District F last month.\n\n\u201cWhen I first heard that he was running for office, I started asking around,\u201d Quattro said. \u201cIt seemed like all the Vietnamese in Alief knew that he didn\u2019t live here. They said, no, he lives in Kingwood.\u201d\n\nQuattro said the same has happened twice before in District F since she started paying attention in 2003. She and others have made multiple trips to City Hall and addressed the council about their concern.\n\nFlorian Martin | Houston Public Media\n\nLe said he and his wife started renting a home in Alief in 2014. Houston\u2019s city charter requires a candidate for City Council to live in the district they want to represent for at least a year before Election Day.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m not sure what the controversy that she feels is,\u201d Le said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been there for a while, two years now. And we\u2019ve been active in the community actually for close to 10 years now.\u201d\n\nLe said he often stays at his parents\u2019 house in Kingwood because it\u2019s closer to the Cleveland clinic where he works.\n\nBob Stein, a political scientist at Rice University, said the law is clear on what constitutes a residence, \u201cit\u2019s just hard to figure out whether or not he really lives there or if he just conveniently has an apartment he rents and occasionally shows up to pay the rent, pick up the mail.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the Harris County Attorney\u2019s Office is investigating a complaint by Quattro. First Assistant County Attorney Robert Soard says they have met with Le and are talking to neighbors.\n\nSoard did not comment on any findings they\u2019ve made.", "article_metadata": {"category": "City of Houston", "description": "The Harris County Attorney\u2019s Office is looking into an allegation that Le doesn\u2019t really live in the district he represents.", "programs": "none", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Public Media", "description": "The Harris County Attorney\u2019s Office is looking into an allegation that Le doesn\u2019t really live in the district he represents.", "title": "Some Question Whether Houston City Council Member Steve Le Lives In His District | Houston Public Media", "url": "http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2016/02/16/138070/some-question-whether-houston-city-council-member-steve-le-lives-in-his-district/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/16170645/IMG_2429-1200x800.jpg", "url": "http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/16170645/IMG_2429-1200x800.jpg", "height": 800, "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/16170645/IMG_2429-1200x800.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}, "type": "article"}, "story_id": 466996761, "twitter": {"description": "The Harris County Attorney\u2019s Office is looking into an allegation that Le doesn\u2019t really live in the district he represents.", "title": "Some Question Whether Houston City Council Member Steve Le Lives In His District", "url": "http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2016/02/16/138070/some-question-whether-houston-city-council-member-steve-le-lives-in-his-district/", "image": "http://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/16170645/IMG_2429-1200x800.jpg", "creator": "@houstonpubmedia", "site": "@houstonpubmedia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Florian Martin", "wordCount": 354, "org_id": 220, "datePublished": "2016-02-16T17:27:24+00:00", "fb": {"admins": 37511993, "app_id": 1520489194943572, "pages": 27589213702}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "steve le", "published_time": "2016-02-16T17:27:24+00:00"}, "keywords": "City of Houston, Elections, News, district f, election 2015, harris county attorney, houston city council, residency, steve le", "google-site-verification": "QOrBnMZ1LXDA9tL3e5WmFUU-oI3JUbDRotOWST1P_Dg", "has_audio": 1, "bitly-verification": "7777946f1a0a"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd912e\"", "article_summary": "Houston\u2019s city charter requires a candidate for City Council to live in the district they want to represent for at least a year before Election Day.\nThe Harris County Attorney\u2019s Office is looking into an allegation that Le doesn\u2019t really live in the district he represents.\n/ DownloadFlorian Martin | Houston Public MediaBarbara Quattro, who says she has lived in Alief since 1979, is upset because she doesn\u2019t feel represented by Steve Le.\nHe became the council member for District F last month.\nFlorian Martin | Houston Public MediaLe said he and his wife started renting a home in Alief in 2014."}
