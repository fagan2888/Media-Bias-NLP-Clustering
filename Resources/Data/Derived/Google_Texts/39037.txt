An Oklahoma teenager has died after police say his friend accidentally shot him.

It happened in Panama, a few days before Thanksgiving. Police say the victim, Ryan Self was on a camping trip with his 14-year-old friend.

The 14-year-old tripped, causing his gun to go off, hitting Self in the neck.

He was taken to a Tulsa hospital, but died Sunday night.

His aunt said he had just turned sixteen.

Regina Hall, Victim's Aunt: "Last Friday, he celebrated his sixteenth birthday. Didn't celebrate, he was in the hospital," said Regina Hall. "It just didn't--it just wasn't supposed to happen to him."

Panama police have ruled it an accident. The District Attorney will decide if any charges will be filed.
