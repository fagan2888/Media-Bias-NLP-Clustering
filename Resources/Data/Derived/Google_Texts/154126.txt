Two brothers are in jail after they were accused of trying to kill their parents at the family's Georgia home, police said.

Just before 8 a.m. Saturday, a woman called 911 "stating her children were trying to kill her and her husband," the Gwinnett County Police Department said in a news release.

"She told the 911 operator that it was their two sons, one 17 and the other 22 years old, trying to kill them both. She stated that her husband was distracting them so she was able to call for help. The call eventually went silent," the police said.

Officers responded to the Snellville, Georgia, home, about 30 miles outside of Atlanta, where they found the father bleeding and seriously injured, police said.

The mother was also seriously injured, police said. Both parents were hospitalized.

"A strong odor of natural gas" was also detected in the house, police said. The sons were arrested and taken to the Gwinnett County Detention Center, police said.

The brothers were identified as Cameron Ervin, 17, and Christopher Ervin, 22, the Gwinnett County Police told ABC News.

"You would never even expect that," neighbor Clint Miller said, according to ABC affiliate WSB-TV in Atlanta. "They're just an everyday normal family in the neighborhood."

Both brothers were charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and arson in the first degree to endanger human life, the police told ABC News. In Georgia, 17 is considered an adult for prosecution of criminal offenses.

Possible motives have not been fully determined, the police said.

Police said it was not clear whether the brothers had lawyers.
