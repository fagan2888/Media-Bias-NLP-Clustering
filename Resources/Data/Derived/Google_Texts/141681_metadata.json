I was very unhappy with the fact that Bush went into Iraq. I was, as you know, in 2003, 2004, even though I\u2019m a builder and deal guy, I got always a lot of publicity for whatever reason, OK? I didn\u2019t have PR people, I just got for whatever reason.\n\n\n\nAnd once somebody said about Iraq, and I said don\u2019t do it because you\u2019re going to destabilize the Middle East. That was a bad step. That was a horrible step.\n\n\n\nThen Obama came in and it\u2019s been a disaster. It\u2019s been a disaster. We\u2019re not a respected country anymore. Our military\u2019s going to hell. Our veterans aren\u2019t treated properly. Obamacare is a disaster; it\u2019s got to be repealed. So many different things.\n\n\n\nThe whole persona of our country is different. And I said I\u2019m going to do this. And it wasn\u2019t something I really wanted to do. Frankly, I wish Obama were a great president. I would be happy. I\u2019d be happy -- doing what I\u2019m doing, Turnberry in Scotland. I\u2019ve some of the greatest jobs in the world. I may never see it again. You know, if I win, I may never see these things again.\n\n\n\nSo I love what I\u2019m doing. I love running. One thing I\u2019ve learned is I get the biggest crowds by far. Much bigger than Bernie Sanders, much bigger than anybody. Not even close. And you know that. And he gets second, by the way. But mine are much bigger.\n\n\n\nI will tell you, the people are incredible, of this country. And they\u2019re really, really smart. They get it.
