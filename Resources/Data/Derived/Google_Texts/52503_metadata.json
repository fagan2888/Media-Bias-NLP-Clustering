It has been well concealed by the noise of battle. Washington is once again fighting about trade. Once more we see most economists lined up in favor of trade along with the global corporations and opposed by the labor unions.\n\nAll this sound and fury creates a gripping, reportable narrative of ongoing battle. But that narrative distracts from what is really going on; the most dangerous part of these new trade pacts is only rarely mentioned. This part is called ISDS.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe initials ISDS are unfamiliar to most people. They stand for Investor State Dispute Settlement. ISDS is a massive expansion of dispute settlement clauses that appear in other trade treaties like the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement. That agreement gave a complaining nation the right to bypass another nation\u2019s court system and bring their claim of economic harm to a panel of international decision-makers. These arbitrators have tremendous leeway in how they interpret the WTO agreement and their decisions have been contentious.\n\nThe U.S., for example, recently lost to Canada and Mexico under this arbitration clause. We are now busy repealing our own laws, which require country of origin labeling (COOL) for beef. We will no longer be allowed to know what country our beef is coming from.\n\nOther treaties have widely extended these WTO provisions and given corporations \u2013 in addition to foreign governments \u2013 the right to sue. ISDS allows corporations to sue any nations in which it does business. Under these treaties, corporations can take a claim of injured profitability to binding arbitration. There is no shortage of such claims. Philip Morris, for example, has sued Uruguay for its anti-smoking legislation and Australia for restricting cigarette advertising.\n\nUnder NAFTA, the American mining company Bilcon successfully sued the Canadian government when Bilcon was forbidden to develop a mine. The Canadian government\u2019s study of the proposal had concluded there was harm to the nature of the surrounding communities, but the arbitrators rejected their decision. The company is suing for $300 million in damages.\n\nThese examples illustrate the crux of the matter. Which do we want to prevail in our country, the laws and standards of our elected government or those of arbitrators? Do we want to substitute binding arbitration for democracy?\n\nFurthermore, nations can be sued for the actions of their states and cities. If ISDS goes through in its present form and Los Angeles raises its minimum wage, the U.S. can be sued by foreign businesses operating there because of the impact on their profitability.\n\nIs this what we want? Do we want to give corporations the right to sue governments to protect their profitability, or do we want to leave to our legal and democratic processes the business of balancing the harms against the gains?\n\nThe history of ISDS suits shows that corporations can use the ISDS process to contest a virtually unlimited range of actions. These include, among many others, measures relating to taxation, environmental regulation, rates for water and electricity, health insurance regulation, and safety regulations for pharmaceutical imports.\n\nAnd what a process it is. Unlike our national courts that can judge a case against a body of law, there is no such body of law; instead, the arbitrators are allowed enormous scope. The Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment gives a compelling and authoritative review of ISDS\u2019s functions and consequences in its policy paper, \u201cInvestor \u2013 State Dispute Settlement, Public Interest and U.S. Domestic Law.\u201d\n\nAnd there will be a chilling effect. In considering any law or action a legislature or local government will need to consider the possibility of an ISDS suit against it. Do we want these possibilities to shape our every action?\n\nFrom the corporate point of view, the importance of \u201cfast track\u201d legislation is that it ties together the trade and ISDS parts of the TPP. With \u201cfast track,\u201d our Senate and House can only accept or reject both parts; with that restriction, their vote may well be shaped by their familiar and visible positions on trade.\n\nWe must separate this ungainly bundle into a trade part and an ISDS part and consider them separately. Once out in the light of day ISDS will perish. This is the outcome that \u201cfast track\u201d seeks to avoid.\n\nWe have here a dagger aimed at the very heart of democracy. We should not give up our national system of laws based on a constitution and a long legal history. We should reject \u201cfast track,\u201d and if we fail at that we should fight on and reject TPP. TPP ties together a contentious trade pact with a process to protect corporate profits that is above our democratic processes. We should stand up for democracy.\n\nGomory is a research professor at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business and a recipient of the National Medal of Science.
