Capella University, recognizing the need for highly trained care coordinators, is now offering care coordination specializations in its RN-to-MSN program and MSN program, along with a graduate certificate in care coordination. Capella University (http://www.capella.edu) is a regionally accredited online university which offers online degree programs designed to help working adults advance in their careers.\n\n\u201cCare coordination as performed by registered nurses with advanced degrees will continue to emerge as a key driver of safe, high quality, and cost effective health care,\u201d said Patrick Robinson, PhD, RN, FAAN, dean of Capella\u2019s School of Nursing & Health Sciences. \u201cCare coordination is essential to our ability as an interprofessional team to deliver patient-centered care. With the advent of value-based payment systems, the survival of organizations across the spectrum of services depends on it.\u201d\n\nWith Capella\u2019s care coordination specializations and certificate, nurses are prepared to be leaders and advocates for patients, focused on providing the quality care they need in a cost-effective and efficient way. According to the MacColl Institute for Healthcare Innovation, when nurses take on care coordination roles, patients experience reductions in emergency room visits, noticeable decreases in medication costs, reduced inpatient charges, significant increases in survival with fewer readmissions, and improved quality of care.\n\n\u201cCare coordination is important because the Affordable Care Act was really structured around a new approach to health care that includes social determinants. They\u2019re now part of everyday healthcare, and they include such questions as: What kind of access do patients have to health care? Do they have transportation? Is there a problem with nutrition that prevents them from being healthier than they are now?\u201d said Honor Martin RN, MS, VP of Clinical Services of Aspire of Western New York, and a member of Capella\u2019s Nursing Advisory Council, \u201cCare coordinators look at the barriers that lie in the way of patients achieving their health goals.\u201d\n\nDelivering a relevant, personalized MSN care coordination program\n\nTo deliver the most relevant, personalized program designed for nurses\u2019 needs and interests, Capella\u2019s MSN Care Coordination program integrates the Case Management Society of America (CMSA) Standards of Practice for Case Management and Patient Centered Medical Home model of care (PCMH). Students prepare to lead collaboration between health care providers and expand their patient advocacy skills to provide the best care possible as well as a comprehensive understanding of their patients\u2019 chronic or complicated medical condition. Like all of Capella\u2019s MSN programs, the MSN in Care Coordination is CCNE-accredited and incorporates the American Association of Colleges of Nursing's (AACN) Essentials of Master's Education in Nursing**.\n\nCapella\u2019s MSN and graduate certificate in care coordination are specifically designed for the busy working nurse. Completing Capella\u2019s graduate certificate in care coordination will allow nurses to differentiate themselves in as little as nine months and complete a significant portion of their MSN in Care Coordination. Both programs integrate evidence-based practices designed for immediate application.\n\nLive stream event: Care Coordination: Changing the Game of Healthcare Delivery\n\nCapella will host a live stream event about what\u2019s involved in the care coordination role and why it\u2019s critical to revolutionize quality care.
