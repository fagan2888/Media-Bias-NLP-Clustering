Today, we pay for each piece of work done and so we get a lot of pieces of work done.\u201d\n\nSpending on drugs, hospitals and other services rose 3.7 percent in 2012, half the rate from before the recession that ended in 2009. While Bertolini ascribed the slowdown to the economy, the U.S. health-care law known as Obamacare also has encouraged collaborations among doctors and hospitals to coordinate patient care. Companies including Hartford, Connecticut-based Aetna, the third-biggest U.S. insurer, have started their own \u201caccountable care\u201d partnerships.\n\nInstead of a medical system of solo practitioners, U.S. health-care needs to \u201cbring the whole team together to get the right services\u201d to patients, Bertolini said from Davos, where he was attending the World Economic Forum.\n\nAmericans are gaining more control and more responsibility for their medical bills, Bertolini said, with individuals paying about 40 percent of costs through premiums, deductibles and other charges.\n\nBertolini said he has first-hand experience with a confusing U.S. health-care system he described as \u201ca maze.\u201d The CEO injured his spinal cord in a 2004 skiing accident and donated a kidney to his son in 2007.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re heading toward a consumer market,\u201d the CEO said. \u201cConsumers want choice. They want it to be simple and they want it to be about them and right now, we don\u2019t have a system that does that for them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Nussbaum", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-22/aetna-ceo-says-out-of-control-health-costs-demand-change-in-u-s-", "title": "Aetna CEO Says Out-of-Control Health Costs Demand Change in U.S.", "description": "Medical expenses remain out of control in the U.S., where Americans have an \u201cunsustainable attitude\u201d that ignores the increasing cost of health care, the chief executive officer of insurer Aetna Inc. said.", "card": "summary", "site": "@business"}, "parsely-author": "Alex Nussbaum", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Aetna Inc,Health", "news_keywords": "Aetna Inc,Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-22/aetna-ceo-says-out-of-control-health-costs-demand-change-in-u-s-", "parsely-title": "Aetna CEO Says Out-of-Control Health Costs Demand Change in U.S.", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-01-22T16:18:50.818Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Medical expenses remain out of control in the U.S., where Americans have an \u201cunsustainable attitude\u201d that ignores the increasing cost of health care, the chief executive officer of insurer Aetna Inc. said.", "parsely-tags": "Aetna Inc,Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-01-22T16:18:50.818Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-22/aetna-ceo-says-out-of-control-health-costs-demand-change-in-u-s-", "type": "website", "site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Medical expenses remain out of control in the U.S., where Americans have an \u201cunsustainable attitude\u201d that ignores the increasing cost of health care, the chief executive officer of insurer Aetna Inc. said.", "title": "Aetna CEO Says Out-of-Control Health Costs Demand Change in U.S."}, "fb": {"status": "Medical expenses remain out of control in the U.S., where Americans have an \u201cunsustainable attitude\u201d that ignores the increasing cost of health care, the chief executive officer of insurer Aetna Inc. said."}, "parsely-post-id": "MZT6LZ6KLVSB01", "format-detection": "telephone=no"}, "article_summary": "\u201cOur health-care costs are not under control right now,\u201d Bertolini said.\n\u201cWe really need to look at how health care is delivered and how we pay for it.\nAmericans are gaining more control and more responsibility for their medical bills, Bertolini said, with individuals paying about 40 percent of costs through premiums, deductibles and other charges.\nCompanies including Hartford, Connecticut-based Aetna, the third-biggest U.S. insurer, have started their own \u201caccountable care\u201d partnerships.\nMedical expenses remain out of control in the U.S., where Americans have an \u201cunsustainable attitude\u201d that ignores the increasing cost of health care, the chief executive officer of insurer Aetna Inc. said."}
