Treasure Coast lawmakers, who oppose expanding health care coverage to up to 650,000 people statewide, pay less than half for insurance through a taxpayer-subsidized plan than the average Floridian.

All but two local state legislators are enrolled in health care coverage offered to state employees, for which they pay $50 a month for an individual plan or $180 for a family plan. They also receive free dental insurance.

The only two legislators who aren’t on the plan — Rep. Larry Lee Jr., D-Port St. Lucie, and Sen. Denise Grimsley, R-Sebring — voted this week in favor of the Senate version of Medicaid expansion, which would cover most people who don’t earn enough to qualify for insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act but too much to receive Medicaid as it is today.

Floridians insured through their employer pay on average $117 for an individual premium and $471 for a family plan per month, according to 2013 data from the nonpartisan Keiser Family Foundation.

The House on Friday killed the Senate proposal to draw down nearly $50 billion in Affordable Care Act dollars over eight years to help Floridians purchase private insurance if they work, are seeking work, attend school, are disabled or caring for a disabled relative. The program would have ended if the federal government reduced or cut its funding.

Although there are 800,000 Floridians — about 30,000 Treasure Coast residents — who qualify for traditional Medicaid expansion, only 580,000 to 650,000 would have met the Senate requirements.

All Treasure Coast House Republicans — Debbie Mayfield of Vero Beach, Gayle Harrell of Stuart, MaryLynn Magar of Tequesta and Cary Pigman of Avon Park — voted against the Senate plan. All of them receive the state health insurance.

Lee, a State Farm insurance agency owner, said the plan isn’t perfect but gave it a yes vote because he said it’s time Florida addresses the uninsured. He pays about $400 a month for a private insurance plan, he said.

“I could go to the state and get insurance for $50,” Lee said, “but that’s not right. I’d be up here as ... part of a Legislature not allowing people out there (to get insurance) working two jobs and making $20,000.”

Magar said Medicaid costs in Florida have soared over the years to almost one-third of the state budget and the Senate proposal would have eliminated the Medically Needy program, where people pay a monthly fee based on their income and become eligible for Medicaid if their health care expenses that month reach the fee amount.

Mayfield said she’s against Medicaid expansion because it would add to the $18 trillion federal debt and defended getting her insurance through the state.

“It’s part of what we have as state employees,” Mayfield said. “When I’m not a state employee I’m going to have to go out and seek my health insurance.”

All Treasure Coast senators — Republicans Joe Negron of Stuart, Thad Altman of Rockledge and Grimsley — voted for the Senate Medicaid expansion version this week. Negron and Altman are insured through the state.

State employees and lawmakers began contributing to health insurance in 2010 but lawmakers paid only $8.34 per month and $30 for a family premium until recently.

Negron proposed in 2012 a measure to force lawmakers to pay the same as state employees, but met sharp opposition from Senate Democrats and Republicans, who argued they already sacrificed financially to be in the Legislature to get paid slightly less than $30,000 a year.

Later during that year’s legislative session, however, the Senate agreed to pay the same as state employees starting in 2013. The House followed suit in 2014.

Today, 36 of 40 senators are enrolled in the state health insurance and 39 get the dental plan. In the 120-member House, 108 take advantage of the health plan but there are not numbers available on how many have dental benefits, said Michael Williams, Speaker Steve Crisafulli’s spokesman. Information on the coverage of individual legislators isn’t public so this article relied on information they provided.

Negron, who in 2013 proposed a health care expansion plan similar to the one the Senate put forward this year, said expanding health coverage will alleviate the burden on hospitals that treat the uninsured.

Florida has relied on the Low Income Pool, a mix of state and federal dollars to help hospitals pay for indigent care, but the federal government announced last year its share would expire in 2015. That sent the House and Senate into a standoff over whether to expand Medicaid to cover the care of people the pool normally pays for. The feds indicated last month they will give $1 billion this year, a $300 million drop from last year.

Negron said he doesn’t see an issue with lawmakers accepting the state health coverage while denying to expand health care to uninsured Floridians.

“I think they are two completely different issues,” Negron said.
