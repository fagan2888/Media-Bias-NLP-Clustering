Sioux Falls, SD

A neighborhood in Sioux Falls was in shock earlier this week after two people were found dead in a home. The police believe that 32-year-old John Vigus shot and killed 20 year-old Kayla Paetow before taking his own life. The reported murder suicide has left a hole in the hearts of Paetow's friends and family.

Kayla Paetow was known by her loved ones as someone that could make anyone laugh and smile, but now people are mourning the loss of the girl that was taken away too soon.

Investigators say she moved into a home with John Vigus last month. The two were found dead with gunshot wounds around 2 p.m. Wednesday afternoon. There's a prayer service for Paetow today in Hurley, where she grew up. Her funeral is scheduled for tomorrow, and friends of Paetow have set up a Go Fund Me page to help pay for the service.

We will hear from people affected by this tragic event coming up tonight on KELOLAND Weekend News at 10.
