You both make great records and you're both millionaires!\" they sang while Bryan and Brown hugged it out in the crowd. \"Kanye hates Kimmel and the Jonas Brothers aren't getting along. Sinead hates Miley and Tom Petty hates us all.\"\n\nLater in the song, the pair change their tune and decide feuds are cool, enlisting Kellie Pickler to hand out enemy assignments to various attendees. Kenny Rogers is now feuding with Paisley and, in an edgy move, Darius Rucker must trade venom with Julianne Hough, who received backlash last month by donning blackface at a Halloween party.\n\nAt some point, Paisley \"twerked\" his back -- a second reference to Cyrus, who is Dolly Parton's godchild -- and needed to stop the song. Cue the joshing of the glitchy rollout for President Obama's Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare.\n\n\"Hey, do you have that Obamacare?\" Underwood asked her hurt co-host. \"Oh it's great! I started signing up last Thursday and I\u2019m almost done. Let's get you to the website and get you signed up. \u2026 This can't be too hard right?\"\n\nSet to George Strait's \"Amarillo By Morning,\" the new song took Obamacare's wonky website to task and showed a willingness of producers to get overtly political, but in a way that appeared to safely cater to the traditionally right-leaning country music community.\n\nObamacare by morning\n\nWhy is this taking so long?\n\nI'm going to wind up with hemorrhoids\n\nIf I sit here 'til dawn.\n\nWe\u2019ll have cataracts and dementia\n\nOh this is getting on my last nerve.\n\nObamacare by morning\n\nOver six people served.\n\nThe new \"hit song\" was quickly picked up by a few conservative media outlets, including Town Hall, Power Line and the Heritage Foundation's blog.\n\nLater, Underwood and Paisley parodied Cyrus and Robin Thicke's MTV VMA performance of \"Blurred Lines\" with a new song called \"Duck Blind.\" They were joined by the Robertson family of \"Duck Dynasty\" fame. Viewers got an eyeful of Willie twerking on Underwood during the song.\n\nCyrus was brought up yet again later in the show by Paisley, who gave Taylor Swift props for making it in music \"without humping a teddy bear or grinding against Beetlejuice,\" a reference to Thicke's striped outfit and other elements from the VMAs.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.title": "Obamacare and Miley Cyrus Tweaked at CMAs", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "marc.schneider", "og": {"url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/5785504/obamacare-and-miley-cyrus-tweaked-at-cmas", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/brad-paisley-carrie-underwood-cma-2013-650.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, "type": "article", "title": "Obamacare and Miley Cyrus Tweaked at CMAs"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_cover/public/media/brad-paisley-carrie-underwood-cma-2013-650.jpg", "description": "The CMA Awards addressed a recent outbreak of feuding in Nashville and tweaked Miley Cyrus' twerking, Julianne Hough's blackface scandal and Obamacare's registration woes during a playful opening...", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Obamacare and Miley Cyrus Tweaked at CMAs"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-11-07T14:10:00-05:00", "msvalidate.01": "A1E392312F2A2F0C85FD3C7753C352AF", "robots": "index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/5785504/obamacare-and-miley-cyrus-tweaked-at-cmas", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.date": "2013-11-07T14:10-05:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "sailthru.tags": "Country,News", "description": "The CMA Awards addressed a recent outbreak of feuding in Nashville and tweaked Miley Cyrus' twerking, Julianne Hough's blackface scandal and Obamacare's registration woes during a playful opening skit featuring hosts Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood Wednesday night."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfcd5\"", "article_summary": "The CMA Awards addressed a recent outbreak of feuding in Nashville and tweaked Miley Cyrus' twerking, Julianne Hough's blackface scandal and Obamacare's registration woes during a playful opening skit featuring hosts Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood Wednesday night.\nLater, Underwood and Paisley parodied Cyrus and Robin Thicke's MTV VMA performance of \"Blurred Lines\" with a new song called \"Duck Blind.\"\nAt some point, Paisley \"twerked\" his back -- a second reference to Cyrus, who is Dolly Parton's godchild -- and needed to stop the song.\nCue the joshing of the glitchy rollout for President Obama's Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare.\nViewers got an eyeful of Willie twerking on Underwood during the song."}
