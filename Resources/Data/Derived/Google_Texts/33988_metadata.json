It is an honor to live and work in a community that supports our local schools.\u201d\n\nHere are seven critical projects for the county:\n\n\u2022 1. New classroom space, $30-50 million\n\nHall school officials have said a new school is needed in the south portion of the county, and Schofield said congestion in the Johnson High School or Flowery Branch High School zones, likely at the middle school level, is the No. 1 priority in the district\u2019s need for the tax.\n\n\u2022 2. Renovation of existing facilities, $30-100 million\n\nGordon Higgins, director of communications and athletics, said the \u201crenovations of existing facilities\u201d primarily include replacing heating and cooling units in schools and replacing roofs.\n\n\u2022 3. Student technology and related infrastructure, $20-30 million\n\nThe school district has installed audio/visual interactive wireless projectors in 720 classrooms, but has about 1,300 more to equip.\n\n\u2022 4. Fine arts facility improvements at East Hall, Johnson and West Hall high schools, $12-20 million\n\n\u2022 5. New school buses, $4-8 million\n\n\u2022 6.
