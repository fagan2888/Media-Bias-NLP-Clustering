The top commander of international forces in Afghanistan said the killing of an American major general would not impact the overall mission.

Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, commander of the International Security Assistance Force, said his command was conducting a joint investigation with the Afghan government, but declined to provide any further details. On Tuesday, an Afghan soldier opened fire on a group of Western military officers, killing Major General Harold Greene, the highest ranking officer to die in the line of duty since the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the Pentagon.

“Yesterday was a tragic event and Maj. Gen. Harry Greene will be sorely missed,” said Gen. Dunford, who is set to become the Marine Corps commandant in the coming weeks. “That said, it doesn’t change the mission or the prospects for our success.”

Gen. Dunford said his forces will “honor his sacrifice” by continuing their work advising and training the Afghan military.

“We’re prepared to resume our duties with the same degree of passion and commitment that Harry Greene demonstrated every day,” Gen. Dunford said.
