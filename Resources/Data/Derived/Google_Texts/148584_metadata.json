The castaway, who was only able to communicate through Spanish, attributed his survival to eating the sea\u2019s wildlife, including birds, fish, and even turtle blood.\n\nAccording to initial reports, Ivan \u2014 later identified as Jose Salvador Alvarenga \u2014 and a friend departed from Mexico in December 2012 on an intended shark fishing expedition. After a problem with the boat\u2019s engine, Alvarenga and his fellow fisherman\u2019s attempts to flag down passing ships failed while they drifted farther and farther away from civilization. Unfortunately, Alvarenga's companion passed away a few months ago while at sea.\n\nAlvarenga continued to float aimlessly in the rough and dangerous waters of the Pacific after watching his companion\u2019s body sink. In order to survive, he admitted to drinking rain water, his own urine, and even turtle blood. He also turned to catching and eating fish and birds with his bare hands. Bearded, sun-burned, and slightly emaciated, Alvarenga arrived on Ebon Atoll over a year after setting sail from his home in Mexico.\n\n\u201cI thank God and I thank the birds I caught to eat,\u201d Alvarenga told the Daily Mail. \"I caught fish and at times I drank my own urine to have liquid. Every day was the same, just the sea, the sea. I saw nothing more. The sea and my boat. I had no idea of time, but I know that it was Dec. 21, 2012, when we left. The days at sea and the nights ... they were all one after a while. I lived on fish that were easy to catch and once I caught a small shark. I know sharks. I used to catch them all the time.\u201d\n\nDoctors in Majuro, where Alvarenga was taken following his unexpected arrival in the Marshall Islands, said he still has lengthy recovery before his physical condition can be considered healthy. In addition to extremely low weight and blood pressure, doctors fear Alvarenga may also be suffering from edema, a condition that causes the body to bloat due to sunlight exposure.\n\n\"His condition isn\u2019t good, but he\u2019s getting better. He's staying at the local council house and a family is feeding him,\" Norwegian anthropologist Ola Fjeldstad told The Guardian. \"We've been giving him a lot of water, and he's gaining strength.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "castaway, mexican, fisherman, 16, months, sea", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Salvadoran fisherman, Jose Salvador Alvarenga, survived over a year on a 24-foot boat by eating birds and drinking turtle blood.", "title": "Castaway Leaving Mexico Survives 16 Months At Sea", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/castaway-jose-salvador-alvarenga-survives-16-months-sea-eating-birds-drinking-turtle-blood-268441", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/03/castaway.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Salvadoran fisherman, Jose Salvador Alvarenga, survived over a year on a 24-foot boat by eating birds and drinking turtle blood.", "title": "Castaway Leaving Mexico Survives 16 Months At Sea", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/castaway-jose-salvador-alvarenga-survives-16-months-sea-eating-birds-drinking-turtle-blood-268441", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/03/castaway.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/03/castaway.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-02-03T12:45:08-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-03T12:56:08-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Salvadoran fisherman, Jose Salvador Alvarenga, survived over a year on a 24-foot boat by eating birds and drinking turtle blood."}, "article_summary": "The castaway, who was only able to communicate through Spanish, attributed his survival to eating the sea\u2019s wildlife, including birds, fish, and even turtle blood.\nIn order to survive, he admitted to drinking rain water, his own urine, and even turtle blood.\n\u201cI thank God and I thank the birds I caught to eat,\u201d Alvarenga told the Daily Mail.\n\"I caught fish and at times I drank my own urine to have liquid.\nEvery day was the same, just the sea, the sea."}
