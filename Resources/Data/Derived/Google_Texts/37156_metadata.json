I absolutely would not agree with that.\u201d\n\nAt first, he stood by that outrageously prejudiced remark, but after coming under fire from not only Muslim groups but also many conservatives, he soon tried to walk it back, to cushion and to caveat it.\n\nOn Monday night, he posted a message on Facebook that included this line: \u201cI could never support a candidate for President of the United States that was Muslim,\u201d Carson wrote, and had not renounced the \u201ccentral\u201d tenet \u201cof Islam: Sharia Law.\u201d\n\nThen on Tuesday, at a news conference, Carson said, \u201cIt has nothing to do with being a Muslim.\u201d He continued: \u201cThat was the question that was specifically asked. If the question had been asked about a Christian and they said, \u2018Would you support a Christian who supports establishing a theocracy?\u2019 I would have said no.\u201d\n\nOnly his original comment was unambiguous: It had everything to do with being a Muslim. And it was bigoted.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut this isn\u2019t Carson\u2019s first time at this rodeo. This has become his modus operandi.\n\nCarson has a way of speaking in a flat, sing-song-y tone while flashing his toothy, 100-watt smile, that can be utterly disarming, if not completely charming.\n\nHis undeniable pedigree as an acclaimed pediatric neurosurgeon adds an air of gravitas to his nonsensical utterances and provides some cover for what can be poisonously harmful, over-the-line invectives.\n\nCarson says in low register what others shout in anger, and he gets a bit of a pass because of the discordant message and method of delivery.\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nJust because a person is soft-spoken doesn\u2019t mean that he is well-spoken.\n\nSince Carson used his 2013 speech at the National Prayer Breakfast to criticize President Obama\u2019s policies to his face, he has been lionized in conservative quarters.\n\nIt\u2019s not that others have not criticized the president before or since, but it was the particularity of the racial imagery of Carson\u2019s critique \u2014 one smart, accomplished black man undressing another in public \u2014 that gave it particular power. It insulated the attack from racial characterization. He said things from the lips of a black conservative that roiled the minds of white ones. And it represented a prominent breaking of ranks, a slicing off of black solidarity from not only Democratic loyalty but also from fidelity with this president.\n\nSince then, Carson\u2019s rhetoric has seemed to get only more reckless.\n\nHe has called Obama a psychopath and a liar. He has compared Obama\u2019s supporters to Nazi sympathizers. He has said that Obamacare is the \u201cworst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,\u201d even worse than the terrorist attacks on 9/11.\n\nHe has asserted that being gay is \u201cabsolutely\u201d a choice as evidenced by people who \u201cgo into prison straight \u2014 and when they come out, they\u2019re gay.\u201d He later apologized in a statement that read in part:\n\n\u201cI do not pretend to know how every individual came to their sexual orientation. I regret that my words to express that concept were hurtful and divisive. For that I apologize unreservedly to all that were offended.\u201d\n\nAnd even when his rhetoric isn\u2019t reckless, it can be wrongheaded.\n\nHe has used the shallowness of race as a biological construct to disavow and diminish the depth of racism as a very real cultural construct.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnd he makes the mistake many people do, of using his personal story of success as a societal prescription for all problems. I have always held that working hard and following the rules are their own reward, but I am not na\u00efve enough to believe that personal behavior can completely countervail structural oppression.\n\nCarson knows that his outrageous antics in his role as the anti-Obama are a most profitable enterprise. He mixes political critique with Christian theological messaging to rake in quite a bit of money on the lecture circuit. As Politico reported in July, Carson \u201cbrought in nearly $2 million delivering inspirational speeches to faith-based groups like Christian high schools and pregnancy centers in 2014,\u201d with speaking fees ranging \u201cfrom $12,320 to $48,500.\u201d\n\nThis is a sad turn \u2014 spurred, I believe, by profit motive \u2014 for such a great legacy.\n\nI, like many other African-Americans, had come to see Carson as a hero before his foray into politics because of the resonance of his personal story \u2014 a poor inner-city child being raised by a driven single mother who valued education and instilled in him a sense of character that would allow him to become a staggering success.\n\nCarson was the embodiment of possibility. His 1990 book, \u201cGifted Hands,\u201d was required reading for many young people.\n\nBut as a political figure, his stature is diminished as he reveals himself to be intolerant, bordering on soft bigotry, and also reckless and needlessly inflammatory. No one can discount what Carson accomplished professionally, but those accomplishments must now stand shoulder to shoulder with this new persona: whisper-soft purveyor of hyperbolic hucksterism.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150923191509, "twitter": {"description": "His pedigree as a neurosurgeon adds gravitas to his nonsensical utterances and provides some cover for poisonously harmful, over-the-line invectives.", "title": "The Soft Bigotry of Ben Carson", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/opinion/charles-blow-the-soft-bigotry-of-ben-carson.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003933306"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "CharlesMBlow", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/01/opinion/blow-circular/blow-circular-thumbLarge-v8.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/opinion/charles-blow-the-soft-bigotry-of-ben-carson.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003933306", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/opinion/charles-blow-the-soft-bigotry-of-ben-carson.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 23, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "keywords": "Carson  Benjamin S,Presidential Election of 2016,Race and Ethnicity,Muslims and Islam,Homosexuality and Bisexuality,United States Politics and Government", "CN": "charles-m-blow", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Charles M.
