First, some background on an Arkansas special election that was decided earlier this week:\n\nThe special election for a northeast Arkansas Senate seat vacated by a lawmaker who resigned over ethics violations will be an early bellwether on the fight to protect the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion, as well as Democrats\u2019 chances in the November election. Voters head to the polls Tuesday to cast ballots in the special election between Democrat Steve Rockwell and Republican John Cooper for state Senate District 21 seat that covers the Jonesboro area. The winner will serve the remainder of the term of former state Sen. Paul Bookout \u2013 a Democrat. The race for Bookout\u2019s seat between Rockwell and Cooper has centered on the key issue facing lawmakers when they return for next month\u2019s fiscal session \u2013 whether to continue the state\u2019s \u201cprivate option\u201d plan to expand Medicaid.\n\nCraighead County has not been represented by a Republican in the state senate since reconstruction. An analysis from the left-wing Daily Kos explained the dynamics and significance of this race:\n\nCraighead County is part of the Delta. As such, it is part of the rural Democratic coalition that dominated state politics for over a century. Today, county politics are still largely Democratic\u2026On the politics side of things, this election is huge. Craighead County is a key area of the state for both Mark Pryor and Mike Ross to win (they need to get at minimum 49% of the vote in this county to win the state) If Rockwell can\u2019t put up a decent showing, Democrats are going to have some serious issues going into 2014.\n\nSo here we had a contested race in a traditionally Democratic area, the outcome of which held significant implications for Mark Pryor\u2019s re-election bid. An Obamacare-related controversy drove the campaign. Oh, and according to an email blast from the NRSC, the Republican candidate was outgunned on the spending front by a three-to-one margin. Your result:\n\nIt wasn\u2019t even close. The victorious Cooper called his triumph a \u201cstatement win.\u201d Indeed. I\u2019d imagine Sen. Pryor can hear that statement loud and clear.\n\nRecently in the Green Room:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Upset: Republican wins surprise blowout in Arkansas Senate special election", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Greenroom", "description": "Let\u2019s read some 2014 tea leaves, shall we? \u00a0First, some background on an Arkansas special election that was decided earlier this week: The special election for a northeast Arkansas Senate sea\u2026", "title": "Upset: Republican wins surprise blowout in Arkansas Senate special election", "url": "http://hotair.com/greenroom/archives/2014/01/17/upset-republican-wins-surprise-blowout-in-arkansas-senate-special-election/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-17T15:56:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-10T20:47:32+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7c0b\"", "article_summary": "Upset: Republican wins surprise blowout in Arkansas Senate special electionposted at 10:56 am on January 17, 2014 by Guy BensonLet\u2019s read some 2014 tea leaves, shall we?\nFirst, some background on an Arkansas special election that was decided earlier this week:The special election for a northeast Arkansas Senate seat vacated by a lawmaker who resigned over ethics violations will be an early bellwether on the fight to protect the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion, as well as Democrats\u2019 chances in the November election.\nAs such, it is part of the rural Democratic coalition that dominated state politics for over a century.\nVoters head to the polls Tuesday to cast ballots in the special election between Democrat Steve Rockwell and Republican John Cooper for state Senate District 21 seat that covers the Jonesboro area.\nCraighead County has not been represented by a Republican in the state senate since reconstruction."}
