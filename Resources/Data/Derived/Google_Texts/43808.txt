Slicing and dicing the body of American workers has come up with a new demographic: the “high-net-worker,” with a high income and spending habits to match, an apparently inexhaustible appetite for work and scorn for the very idea of retirement.

These HNWs, according to EverBank research, are between 41–63 years old. They have an average household income of $374,000 and median investable assets between $750,000 to $1 million.
