But what does their under-performance look like? Jinx!, CC BY 2.0\n\nShe sits in the front row, her chin propped up on her hand, mindlessly doodling over her notebook. She isn\u2019t slacking off. She\u2019s just waiting for the other kids to finish. The boy staring out the window, into the empty spaces of the clouds \u2014 he isn\u2019t daydreaming. He\u2019s tracking imaginary differential curves in his mind.\n\nLike the pockets of gifted children around the country, these students face a curriculum that moves too slowly for them. They aren\u2019t disengaged with the work because it\u2019s too hard, but because it\u2019s too easy. They devour lesson plans in minutes where other kids take weeks. And though many of them go on to enjoy wild success, their intellects guiding them to professions of their choice, researchers have now discovered, through the largest longitudinal study of so-called \u201cprofoundly gifted\u201d children \u2014 those in the top 0.01 percent of intelligence \u2014 that many had to rely on their own strengths to excel, in spite of an education system designed to hold them back.\n\nShoot For The Moon\n\nWhen Americans talk about education reform, they talk about federal policies to give public schools more funding, better textbooks. They want to help the stragglers join their peers at the head of the class. It\u2019s an ethos couched in teaching to the middle of the pack. But the lower fringe receives far more attention than the super high-achievers, according to a new study from Vanderbilt University\u2019s Peabody College of education and human development.\n\n\u201cGifted children are a precious human-capital resource,\u201d remarked study leader Professor David Lubinski, who has spent four decades analyzing the relationship between early SAT scores and future achievement. Lubinski\u2019s main focuses are a child\u2019s verbal and mathematical reasoning skills. These, he says, do a good job of forecasting how kids who are exceptionally bright will fare later in life. \u201cThis population represents future creators of modern culture and leaders in business, health care, law, the professoriate, and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics),\u201d he continued. \u201cOur study provides new insight into the potential of these children.\u201d\n\nTo carry out their study, which began when the 320 subjects were 13 and concluded at age 38, Lubinski and his colleagues drew from a pool of children who demonstrated incredible proficiency on the SAT at or before age 13, scoring in the top 0.01 percentile on the test. (To put it another way, they were smarter than 99.99 percent of their peers.) The research team used these initial measures and correlated them with each child\u2019s trajectory, checking back to see how far they matriculated through college, which professions they entered, how much they earned, and the like. Many grew up to be senior leaders at Fortune 500 companies; some became leading software engineers; others took a fondness for politics, as one subject even became a top advisor for the president of the United States.\n\nBut there was a problem. These successes were belied by years of educational setbacks and systemic pitfalls. Lubinski and his team discovered teachers weren\u2019t finding time to challenge the gifted students in nearly the same capacity as they were for the students with learning disabilities, something Lubinski looked upon with disappointment.\n\n\u201cAbility, motivation, and opportunity all play roles in developing exceptional human capacity and providing the support needed to cultivate it throughout life,\u201d he said.\n\nRaising And Lowering The Bar\n\nThis raises the obvious question: Aren\u2019t the gifted kids already ready, willing, and able to develop \u201cexceptional human capacity\u201d? (That is, if they don\u2019t already possess it.) To which postdoctoral research fellow and co-researcher, Harrison Kell, seems to offer an answer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this idea that gifted students don\u2019t really need any help,\u201d Kell said in the release. \u201cThis study shows that\u2019s not the case. These people with very high IQs \u2014 what some have called the \u2018scary smart\u2019\u2014 will do well in regular classrooms, but they still won\u2019t meet their full potential unless they\u2019re given access to accelerated coursework, AP classes, and educational programs that place talented students with their intellectual peers.\u201d\n\nWhat Kell is implying isn\u2019t new. The social sciences have known for some time that kids underperform when they are surrounded by kids who tend to underperform themselves. Likewise, kids who struggle with reading comprehension and math see their test scores skyrocket when they\u2019re placed in reading and math groups with kids who generally do well. In both cases, the effect is the same. Peer groups leave lasting impacts on children\u2019s overall cognitive skills and, what\u2019s more, boost their appreciation for cultivating new ones. It\u2019s not just the case that kids in the low-achieving groups don\u2019t do well; often, they don\u2019t want to do well, and usually because they have learned to expect failure when they try.\n\nThe kids in Lubinski\u2019s study are a different breed altogether. They like learning. Why wouldn\u2019t they? They\u2019re good at it. People enjoy the tasks in which they excel, or at the very least, those in which they see room for growth. Indeed, the child learning to read The Odyssey in its original Greek needs motivation as much as the girl next to her, who\u2019s only beginning to read without the aid of a guiding finger. But to what extent that role should be the responsibility of the teacher remains a point of contention. As Kell points out, many gifted children find pleasure in learning within the structure of high school-oriented university programs \u2014 an alternative to simply throwing a gawky 13-year-old into the lion\u2019s den of sophomore or junior year just because he\u2019s brainy.\n\nAs for working solutions to the problem of acceleration versus accommodation, Lubinski leaves it open, though he finds success in the study\u2019s metrics. \u201cThe higher the intellectual ability, the more difficult it may be to match a student with appropriate educational opportunities and curricula,\u201d he concludes. \u201cOur study shows what kinds of measures you need to pinpoint the extraordinarily gifted among the gifted students.\u201d\n\nSource: Kell H, Lubinski D, Benbow C.
