Against Carolina, he had just two catches for 22 yards in the second half.\n\nIn the Redskins\u2019 47-14 win against the New Orleans Saints, Jackson hauled in a 42-yard pass on the third play of the game. He caught another pass for a two-yard gain in the second quarter, but that was it.\n\n\u201cI think his legs are fine,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of whatever play we called, maybe the coverage dictates us going somewhere else. They might have cover-two \u00ad\u2014 a safety over the top of him. Carolina was playing a lot of the read cover-two last week, where it\u2019s hard to get him the ball down the sideline or to the post. So, it might be some underneath-type throws and we have other guys that are in those spots.\n\n\u201cWe have to make sure we try to keep him in the game for four quarters and try to get him some more looks, him and Pierre [Gar\u00e7on] both,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to spread it out with the running game and trying to get Jordan Reed involved and Jamison [Crowder] and all that stuff, I think everybody\u2019s just got to do what they\u2019re supposed to do on each individual play and let Kirk [Cousins] make the decision where the ball goes. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get DeSean involved for four quarters.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jackson scored his first touchdown of the season last week against the Panthers on a 56-yard reception.
