The goal: provide more insurance choices, at a lower cost, without the wasteful spending on the ill-conceived and broken MNsure bureaucracy.\n\nThe Star Tribune\u2019s Feb. 22 editorial (\u201cA nonpartisan look at MNsure\u2019s lapses\u201d) implied that the Republican response to the legislative auditor\u2019s report was reactionary. The truth is that Republicans have been proposing health care solutions for years. In light of the legislative auditor\u2019s scathing critique, these solutions are needed now more than ever.\n\nAfter two years and nearly $200 million:\n\n\u2022 MNsure\u2019s implementation remains seriously flawed and customer service is still poor.\n\n\u2022 The state\u2019s consultant is suggesting a complete replacement of MNsure\u2019s core technology system at a cost of tens of millions of dollars.\n\n\u2022 91 percent of the enrollees for which MNsure takes credit actually signed up for existing government insurance programs, MinnesotaCare and Medicaid, not the MNsure exchange\u2019s private coverages.\n\n\u2022 Enrollments in MNsure\u2019s private coverages are a fraction of original projections.\n\n\u2022 MNsure requires massive subsidies from both state and county taxpayers.\n\n\u2022 Promises regarding costs and keeping plans and doctors were broken, and implementation problems were hidden.\n\nThese are telltale signs of program failure. Yet Gov. Mark Dayton\u2019s proposal is, once again, more money. That\u2019s right, on top of a one-time $39 million federal bailout for MNsure this year, the Dayton administration is proposing a $12-million-per-year increase in the already far-too-high Minnesota taxpayer subsidy.\n\nMNsure\u2019s insolvency will only get worse as federal subsidies expire in 2016 and MNsure becomes entirely dependent on state and county taxpayers. In contrast, Republican solutions propose a redesign that will work within the policy framework of Obamacare, in spite of our opposition to it.\n\nShort of federal action changing Obamacare, these workable strategies would improve access, choice and cost in Minnesota:\n\n\u2022 Only 9 percent of MNsure enrollees actually bought the private coverages, and these enrollees don\u2019t need MNsure\u2019s failed technology to find their insurance. H.F. 5, authored by Rep. Tara Mack, R-Apple Valley, proposes waivers allowing enrollees to take their government subsidy to private-sector insurance exchanges, which already offer Obamacare-compliant private coverages and work perfectly. We should free these MNsure-locked customers to shop wherever they want! Using the federal exchange could also be evaluated.\n\n\u2022 The 91 percent enrolled in government\u2019s MinnesotaCare and Medicaid programs, which have been available for years, were enrolled through the regular process and systems at the Minnesota Department of Human Services (DHS). They can continue to be. These enrollees do not need MNsure to get their coverage either!\n\n\u2022 Shut down the unnecessary MNsure bureaucracy and operations. S.F. 810, authored by Sen. Michelle Benson, R-Ham Lake, proposes an alternative nonprofit structure to manage Obamacare coverages, much like the Minnesota Comprehensive Health Association operated successfully.\n\n\u2022 Evaluate whether any components of MNsure\u2019s technology or operations could be salvaged by the DHS to improve the enrollment process for MinnesotaCare and Medicaid. If not, shut them down altogether.\n\nEven without changes to Obamacare, this Republican strategy of common sense and consumer choice means coverage options stay the same, service improves and taxpayers save tens of millions of dollars per year!\n\nThe Star Tribune Editorial Board did readers a disservice by dismissing outright the well-considered and realistic Republican solutions being proposed, especially in the absence of any serious proposal from MNsure\u2019s advocates.\n\nLet\u2019s face facts. Two years and nearly $200 million dollars later, MNsure still doesn\u2019t work right or pay for itself. Whether you support Obamacare or not, it is past time to cut our losses on MNsure and provide real health insurance improvements and cost control. That\u2019s not reactionary, that\u2019s good government.\n\nKeith Downey is chairman of the Republican Party of Minnesota.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No more wasted tax dollars \u2014 our ideas will provide more choices at lower cost.", "og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "No more wasted tax dollars \u2014 our ideas will provide more choices at lower cost.", "title": "GOP has cures for what ails MNsure", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/gop-has-cures-for-what-ails-mnsure/294298161/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_14249976623275.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_14249976623275.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No more wasted tax dollars \u2014 our ideas will provide more choices at lower cost.", "title": "GOP has cures for what ails MNsure", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/gop-has-cures-for-what-ails-mnsure/294298161/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_14249976623275.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_14249976623275.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "article": {"tag": "Michelle Benson"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "news_keywords": "ObamaCare,MNsure,Republicans,Gov.
