The the same pattern can be seen even in America \u2013 especially in American politics.\n\nBefore the rise of the nation-state, between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries, the world was mostly tribal. Tribes were united by language, religion, blood, and belief. They feared other tribes and often warred against them. Kings and emperors imposed temporary truces, at most.\n\nBut in the past three hundred years the idea of nationhood took root in most of the world. Members of tribes started to become citizens, viewing themselves as a single people with patriotic sentiments and duties toward their homeland. Although nationalism never fully supplanted tribalism in some former colonial territories, the transition from tribe to nation was mostly completed by the mid twentieth century.\n\nOver the last several decades, though, technology has whittled away the underpinnings of the nation state. National economies have become so intertwined that economic security depends less on national armies than on financial transactions around the world. Global corporations play nations off against each other to get the best deals on taxes and regulations.\n\nNews and images move so easily across borders that attitudes and aspirations are no longer especially national. Cyber-weapons, no longer the exclusive province of national governments, can originate in a hacker\u2019s garage.\n\nNations are becoming less relevant in a world where everyone and everything is interconnected. The connections that matter most are again becoming more personal. Religious beliefs and affiliations, the nuances of one\u2019s own language and culture, the daily realities of class, and the extensions of one\u2019s family and its values \u2013 all are providing people with ever greater senses of identity.\n\nThe nation state, meanwhile, is coming apart. A single Europe \u2013 which seemed within reach a few years ago \u2013 is now succumbing to the centrifugal forces of its different languages and cultures. The Soviet Union is gone, replaced by nations split along tribal lines. Vladimir Putin can\u2019t easily annex the whole of Ukraine, only the Russian-speaking part. The Balkans have been Balkanized.\n\nSeparatist movements have broken out all over \u2014 Czechs separating from Slovaks; Kurds wanting to separate from Iraq, Syria, and Turkey; even the Scots seeking separation from England.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former secratary of labor says Dems and GOP no longer share the same basic values -- and that nationhood is dead", "title": "Robert Reich: Tribalism is tearing America apart", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Former secratary of labor says Dems and GOP no longer share the same basic values -- and that nationhood is dead", "title": "Robert Reich: Tribalism is tearing America apart", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/25/robert_reich_tribalism_is_tearing_america_apart_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former secratary of labor says Dems and GOP no longer share the same basic values -- and that nationhood is dead", "title": "Robert Reich: Tribalism is tearing America apart", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "creator": "@rbreich", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Robert Reich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Creationism, Democrats, Obamacare, Republicans, RobertReich.org, Ted Cruz, tribalism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd6fc\"", "article_summary": "Over the last several decades, though, technology has whittled away the underpinnings of the nation state.\nThe nation state, meanwhile, is coming apart.\nBefore the rise of the nation-state, between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries, the world was mostly tribal.\nTopics: Creationism, Democrats, Obamacare, Republicans, RobertReich.org, Ted Cruz, tribalism, Elections News, Social News, Life News, News, Politics NewsThis originally appeared on Robert Reich's blogWe are witnessing a reversion to tribalism around the world, away from nation states.\nAlthough nationalism never fully supplanted tribalism in some former colonial territories, the transition from tribe to nation was mostly completed by the mid twentieth century."}
