Star struck?

Here is an opportunity to move into a 8,000-square-foot home owned by Golden Globe winner Melanie Griffith.

The log home sits on 12 acres on the back of Aspen Mountain, has a ski run on the property and comes with a caretaker. “It really is an oasis,” said Bob Bowden, the real estate agent handling the sale.

Griffith, who won the Golden Globe for Best Actress for her work in 1988’s “Working Girl,” appears in a video promoting the sale of the home, which has seven bedrooms and eight bathrooms.

The price is $8.9 million.

“It is absolutely private, bordered by (Bureau of Land Management) land,” said Bowden.

“It is an absolute adventurers’ paradise up there,” he added.
