The actions were because of Obama administration policies, the Washington Examiner reports.\n\nJessica Vaughan, the director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, told the Washington Examiner that, based on internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement data, in FY 2015 Immigration and Customs Enforcement encountered 152,393 criminal illegal immigrants but charged just 64,116 with immigration violations.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nAnother 88,000 of those illegal immigrant criminals encountered by ICE were not placed in deportation proceedings. As the Washington Examiner notes, even more criminal aliens are released by local jails, despite immigration requests for local authorities to hold deportable criminal aliens.\n\nUnder Obama\u2019s recently announced Priority Enforcement Program, officials work with local police to arrest and deport criminal immigrants. In reality, that amounts to a phone call from ICE requesting local authorities hold the suspect for 48 hours after they\u2019re set to be freed. But several sheriffs from around the country say that just 35-40 percent of those held are ever seized by ICE, even after they\u2019ve been released.\n\nThe executive actions on immigration Obama announced in 2014 also brought an end to the Secure Communities program and shifted immigration enforcement to illegal immigrants deemed \u201cpriorities.\u201d In Secure Communities\u2019 place the administration implemented the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP).\n\nThe Obama administration has been criticized by immigration hawks for years over its lack of immigration enforcement and propensity to release criminal aliens back into U.S. communities. Republican lawmakers have, for example, slammed the PEP program as a threat to public safety as many criminal immigrants are required to simply be released.\n\nSen. Jeff Sessions has called the program, a \u201ca game of Russian roulette.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy defining its \u2018priorities\u2019 to exclude large categories of illegal immigrants, including those who have already been ordered deported or those who illegally reenter after having been deported, PEP ensures that countless more dangerous aliens will be released into U.S. communities\u2014allowing otherwise entirely preventable crimes, including some of the most violent and egregious, to occur,\u201d Sessions over the summer.\n\nAs of March 2015 more than 347,000 convicted criminal immigrants remained at large in the U.S. And as of September 2015, 918,369 illegal immigrants with final orders of deportation remained in communities across the U.S.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Report: Nearly 90,000 Illegal Immigrant Criminals Released Last Year", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Report: Nearly 90,000 Illegal Immigrant Criminals Released Last Year", "title": "Report: Nearly 90,000 Illegal Immigrant Criminals Released Last Year - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Cuffed-illegals-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/22/report-nearly-90000-illegal-immigrant-criminals-released/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Report: Nearly 90,000 Illegal Immigrant Criminals Released Last Year", "title": "Report: Nearly 90,000 Illegal Immigrant Criminals Released Last Year - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Cuffed-illegals-Getty.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "center for immigration studies, Criminal Aliens, Illegal Immigrant, illegal immigration, Priority Enforcement Program,Big Government, Immigration,illegal immigrant", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Priority Enforcement Program", "published_time": "2016-02-22T07:52:18-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0604\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERNearly 90,000 illegal immigrants that federal officials considered to be \u201ccriminal threats\u201d were released from custody last fiscal year instead of being deported.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAnother 88,000 of those illegal immigrant criminals encountered by ICE were not placed in deportation proceedings.\nUnder Obama\u2019s recently announced Priority Enforcement Program, officials work with local police to arrest and deport criminal immigrants.\nRepublican lawmakers have, for example, slammed the PEP program as a threat to public safety as many criminal immigrants are required to simply be released.\nAs the Washington Examiner notes, even more criminal aliens are released by local jails, despite immigration requests for local authorities to hold deportable criminal aliens."}
