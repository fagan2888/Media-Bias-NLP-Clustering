Photo by Alan Smith.\n\nCOUNCIL TO CONSIDER ABOLISHING COMMISSION\n\nThe three remaining members of the Forrest City Water Utility Commission unanimously selected Calvin Murdock of Marianna as the new manager of the utility during a special called meeting Friday evening.\n\nCommissioners met three times last week in the process to hire a new manager.\n\nThe meetings started Wednesday as chairman Jimmy King and commissioners Gloria Anthony and Michael Jeffers sorted through nine applications for the position. The group agreed to interview interim manager Edward Gregory, Murdock and Cedric Ali Bey of Wynne.\n\nCommissioners interviewed Gregory and Murdock on Thursday. King stated after that meeting that Ali Bey notified the commission that he would not be able to attend the Thursday meeting due to illness. King said the commission would continue the process and hold another called meeting to vote on the manager.\n\nAfter the Times-Herald was published on Friday, King notified the newspaper that a meeting to name the new manager would be held at 5:30 p.m., at the Forrest City Civic Center.\n\nThe meeting on Friday was attended by city council members Steve Hollowell, Danny Capps and Henry Peacock, along with Gregory and the commission\u2019s attorney, Andre Valley. As soon as King called the meeting to order, the group went into executive session to discuss the candidates.\n\nThe session lasted for about a half-hour before King reopened the meeting.\n\n\"At this time, we've selected the candidate that will be the next general manager,\" King said. \"That candidate will be Calvin Murdock. So, at this time we need to vote. I need a motion.\"\n\nJeffers made the motion, which was seconded by Anthony. All three commissioners voted to approve Murdock as the new manager.\n\nKing also requested permission to negotiate Murdock's salary should he accept the position.\n\n\"I would like the board to give me permission to negotiate with the candidate with the base salary of $65,000,\" King said.\n\nJeffers asked if the salary would be annually, and King said it would be.\n\nAnthony made the motion, which was seconded by Jeffers, and the request was approved unanimously.\n\nGregory was named interim manager for the utility after Jim Beazley retired from that position in October.\n\nAs interim manager, Gregory has been working under a contract that would allow him to return to his previous position as water treatment supervisor should he not be selected as the utility\u2019s permanent manager.\n\nHaving no other business, the meeting was adjourned.\n\nThe vote by the commission to hire Murdock as manager comes just days before the Forrest City City Council is scheduled to hear the third and final reading of an ordinance that would abolish the commission.\n\nThe ordinance was first presented by Hollowell in September but was tabled after the second reading in October. The matter is on the council's agenda for Tuesday night's regular meeting, which begins at 6 p.m., at city hall.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Times Herald", "description": "The three remaining members of the Forrest City Water Utility Commission unanimously selected Calvin Murdock of Marianna as the new manager of the utility during a special called meeting Friday eve\u2026", "title": "Murdock selected as new FC Water Utility manager", "url": "http://thnews.com/2014/03/03/murdock-selected-as-new-fc-water-utility-manager/", "image": {"width": 342, "identifier": "http://i0.wp.com/thnews.com/media/web-ats3-3-health.jpg?fit=342%2C288", "height": 288}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-03T19:31:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-03T19:31:35+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://i0.wp.com/thnews.com/media/web-ats3-3-health.jpg?fit=342%2C288&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5d6f\"", "article_summary": "There were several health care booths set up, presenters and In Person Assisters (IPAs) helping people sign up for health care.\nCOUNCIL TO CONSIDER ABOLISHING COMMISSIONThe three remaining members of the Forrest City Water Utility Commission unanimously selected Calvin Murdock of Marianna as the new manager of the utility during a special called meeting Friday evening.\n\"At this time, we've selected the candidate that will be the next general manager,\" King said.\nAs interim manager, Gregory has been working under a contract that would allow him to return to his previous position as water treatment supervisor should he not be selected as the utility\u2019s permanent manager.\nThe group agreed to interview interim manager Edward Gregory, Murdock and Cedric Ali Bey of Wynne."}
