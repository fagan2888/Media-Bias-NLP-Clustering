At the Golden Globes, Douglas said he had been worried his casting in \u201cCandelabra\u201d had meant his previous acting for director Steven Soderbergh had been \u201cmincing\u201d \u2014 a (barely-)coded word that\u2019s long been used to express disdain for feminine gay men.\n\nAt tonight\u2019s SAG Awards, Douglas began with a sincere tribute to his fellow nominees \u2014 all had seemed to have been going so well! And then he declared that he and Damon, nominated against one another at all three major awards ceremonies, had \u201cgone head-to-head\u201d over the course of the past year. He paused for laughs \u2014 the joke, you see, was that \u201chead\u201d is a slang term for oral sex.\n\nWhen Douglas has discussed straight oral sex in the press (which, bizarrely, he has, claiming that performing cunnilingus gave him throat cancer), it is very serious. When he discusses the sort of sex his character had, it\u2019s all a big joke \u2014 a weird, surreal thing that\u2019s so obviously funny that Douglas need do no more than allude to it to get a laugh, which the room gamely gave him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"Behind the Candelabra\" star never disappoints -- it's his third nasty public joke about gay sex in a year", "title": "Michael Douglas makes a \u201chead-to-head\u201d homophobic crack at the Screen Actors Guild Awards", "og": {"url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/19/michael_douglas_makes_a_head_to_head_homophobic_crack_at_the_screen_actors_guild_awards/", "site_name": "Salon", "type": "article", "description": "The \"Behind the Candelabra\" star never disappoints -- it's his third nasty public joke about gay sex in a year", "title": "Michael Douglas makes a \u201chead-to-head\u201d homophobic crack at the Screen Actors Guild Awards"}, "twitter": {"description": "The \"Behind the Candelabra\" star never disappoints -- it's his third nasty public joke about gay sex in a year", "title": "Michael Douglas makes a \u201chead-to-head\u201d homophobic crack at the Screen Actors Guild Awards", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@dpd_"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Behind the Candelabra, liberace, matt damon, Michael Douglas, SAG Awards, screen actors guild awards", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce8bb\"", "article_summary": "At tonight\u2019s SAG Awards, Douglas began with a sincere tribute to his fellow nominees \u2014 all had seemed to have been going so well!\nTopics: Behind the Candelabra, liberace, matt damon, Michael Douglas, SAG Awards, screen actors guild awards, Entertainment NewsMichael Douglas, winning his third major award for his role as the gay pianist Liberace in the TV movie \u201cBehind the Candelabra,\u201d fulfilled expectations by making a third snarky joke about gay sex.\nHe paused for laughs \u2014 the joke, you see, was that \u201chead\u201d is a slang term for oral sex.\nWhen Douglas has discussed straight oral sex in the press (which, bizarrely, he has, claiming that performing cunnilingus gave him throat cancer), it is very serious.\nAnd then he declared that he and Damon, nominated against one another at all three major awards ceremonies, had \u201cgone head-to-head\u201d over the course of the past year."}
