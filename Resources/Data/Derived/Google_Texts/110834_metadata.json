(WTNH) \u2014 Nursing home workers that postponed their strike at 27 nursing homes last month were at the State Capitol Tuesday. They postponed their strike for higher wages at the request of the Governor until the state budget battle is completed.\n\nThe workers are pleading with lawmakers to find more money for Medicaid so that their employers will be willing to give them a raise.\n\nBy one estimate, 70-percent of the patients in Connecticut nursing homes are on Medicaid. That\u2019s where the bulk of healthcare workers wages come from. The workers at the Capitol were some of the 3,500 that postponed their strike last month in hopes the legislature would approve more funding.\n\n\u201cI really need a raise, I know that we all do,\u201d said Kim Solomakos of Brooklyn, a Certified Nurses Aide at a nursing home in eastern Connecticut. \u201cThe cost of living has been going up and our wages stay the same.\u201d\n\nRELATED STORY: Thousands of healthcare workers plan to strike\n\nRELATED STORY: Nursing home strike postponed\n\nMany, mostly Certified Nurses Aides, work two jobs doing the hard work of taking care of the state\u2019s elderly and frail residents. Natasha Henry of Waterbury works at two nursing homes in Waterbury.\n\n\u201c$13.74 and $12.35 an hour, that\u2019s not a lot because being a CNA is a tough challenge to go by today,\u201d she said. \u201cWe got to put up with a lot with residents, so I think $13.74 an hour, that\u2019s not enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou entrust them to us so we have to do our best, and I think we are overworked and we are underpaid,\u201d said Opal Hawes, who also lives and works in Waterbury.\n\n\u201cI have to work a lot of overtime to support my family; I\u2019m a single mother,\u201d said Solomakos. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to make car payments and buy food and all the costs with the wage that I make.\u201d\n\nAn additional $9 million has been proposed by the Appropriations Committee, but the healthcare workers union says that won\u2019t be enough. The union says the average age of these workers is 44, and despite having over 10 years of experience, more than half of them make less than $15 per hour.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Connecticut, healthcare, nursing home, workers, employees, CNA, Certified Nurses Aides, strike, raise, higher, wages, pay", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488522642", "og": {"site_name": "WTNH Connecticut News", "description": "Nursing home workers that postponed their strike at 27 nursing homes last month were\u00a0at the State Capitol Tuesday.
