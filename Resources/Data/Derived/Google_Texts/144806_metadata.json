A majority of Republican senators have endorsed an approach to keep those subsidies in place until September 2017, but Cruz flatly said \u201cno\u201d when asked if he\u2019d sign on as well.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI think the best legislative option is to allow states to opt out,\u201d Cruz said in the Capitol. \u201cI am cautiously optimistic that the Supreme Court will conclude in King vs. Burwell that the Obama IRS disregarded the plain language of the statute and acted lawlessly. And when that occurs, it will be a real opportunity for Congress to lead.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cIn a perfect world, we would take that opportunity to repeal Obamacare. At a minimum, we should allow states to opt out.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s comments underscore the challenges for Republican leaders if they win the Supreme Court case: They\u2019ll have to find a way to help the millions who could immediately see their health care costs skyrocket without appearing to endorse a law they universally despise.\n\nAnd it\u2019s bound to grow more complicated with the injection of 2016 politics: Republican senators in blue-states facing reelection will be eager to avoid a public revolt and find a way to keep federal dollars flowing to people who rely on the subsides to defray their health care costs; conservatives running for president will be eager to renew their demands to kill the controversial law once and for all.\n\nThere are several proposals aimed at addressing this dilemma, with one leading option proposed by Sen. Ron Johnson, a conservative up for reelection next year in Wisconsin, which has a federal exchange. While Johnson\u2019s approach would extend the subsidies through the summer of 2017, it would also kill the law\u2019s individual and employer mandates and repeal insurance industry reforms, a proposal backed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) with 31 co-sponsors.\n\nOther Republicans have proposed their own version, including freshman Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who wants to allow financial assistance through tax credits over 18 months but gradually reduce them over that timeframe. And Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), another freshman, has a plan that would not keep the subsidies, though he\u2019s signaled he\u2019d be open to extending them depending on how the court rules.\n\nCruz has been open to some transition period in the past. In February, Cruz offered his own bill to repeal Obamacare. But his bill says the current law would stay in place for six months after the measure\u2019s enactment date.\n\nIt\u2019s not unlike Cruz to battle his party over health care; he did it in 2013 after a 21-hour speech demanding that the GOP use a must-pass spending bill to defund Obamacare. When the end result was a government shutdown, he became a scourge of Republicans in Washington.\n\nSen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), a member of Republican leadership, said it\u2019s unfair to contend that Republicans are seeking to protect the law if they were to temporarily extend the subsidies.\n\n\u201cRepublicans will have a response to protect the people who have been hurt by the president\u2019s illegal action, but we are not going to protect the law,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "\u201cIn a perfect world, we would take that opportunity to repeal Obamacare,\u201d he says.", "title": "Cruz fights GOP approach on Obamacare subsidies", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/ted-cruz-fight-obamacare-subsidies-supreme-court-118875.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/06/11/150610_ted_cruz_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,2016 Elections,King V.
