To mimic human binge drinking patterns, researchers gave rats alcohol for two straight days, didn\u2019t give them any for two days (only water), and repeated this pattern for a total of 13 days. Some of the rats were studied after the 13 days, but given a choice between alcohol and water in order to measure for new, abnormal behaviors.\n\nThe results showed rats were affected by alcohol into adulthood even after the initial study. They experienced anxiety-like behaviors and drank more alcohol than water. These changes, researchers found, stem from the brain\u2019s amygdala.\n\nWhen the amygdala was analyzed in alcohol-drinking rats, DNA and histone proteins were tightly wrapped. There were also increased levels of a protein called HDAC2, which is thought to trigger DNA to wrap tighter around histones.\n\n\u201cGenes that lie within DNA that is tightly wrapped around the histones are less active than they are if the DNA is loosely wrapped,\u201d said Dr. Subhash C. Pandey, lead researcher and director of neuroscience alcoholism research at the University of Illinois at Chicago, in a press release. \u201cThe looser the DNA is coiled, the more accessible are the genes to the cellular machinery that makes relevant proteins.\u201d\n\nPandey added these epigenetic changes were linked to two specific genes: the brain-derived neurotrophic factor and activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated proteins. Nerve cells need these to form new connections. And to support their hypothesis further, Pandey and his team administered a drug that blacks HDAC2 in rats and loosens the coiling of DNA. The rats receiving this drug then exhibited less anxiety and reduced alcohol intake.\n\nFrom here, researchers plan to conduct further research on other epigenetic drugs in order to see if they can reverse the harmful effects of adolescent alcohol exposure.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time science has considered the amygdala in terms of binge drinking. Researchers from the University of North Carolina found producing a natural brain protein neuropeptide in this part of the brain could suppress binge-drinking behavior \u2014 behavior that continues to be popular among adolescents.\n\nIn 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 35 percent of high school students participating in the Youth Risk Behavior Survey drank some amount of alcohol. Twenty-one percent binge drank; 10 percent drove after drinking; and 22 percent got in a car with someone else who had been drinking.\n\nReversing these statistics, the CDC said, is dependent upon \u201ccontinued research and evaluation to determine their success and to improve their effectiveness.\u201d\n\nSource: Pandey SC, et al.
