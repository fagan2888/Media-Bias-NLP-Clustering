ASSERTION:

Companies are cutting benefits because of Obamacare.



FACTS:

Several employers – including UPS, Delta, Univ of Virginia, Trader Joes, Home Depot – have recently announced changes to their employee benefits and cited Obamacare as the reason for the pullback. While it is true that Obamacare is raising costs on employers, there are other factors increasing costs, such as the improving economy. (People use more medical care when the economy is healthier.) Also, companies have been shifting costs to employees for years. While UPS will no longer provide benefits for spouses with coverage options elsewhere, it is not the first company to do so.

VERDICT:

Misleading. Obamacare is contributing to the benefit cuts, but is not the sole reason.
