Today marks the 24th anniversary of one of Kansas' most devastating tornadoes.

Known as the Andover Tornado, the F-5 caused damage across Harper, Sedgwick and Butler Counties on April 26, 1991.

It began with a touchdown in Harper County and then skipped across Sedgwick and Butler counties.

In Sedgwick county it grew to F-3 intensity and tore through parts of south and east Wichita, making a direct hit on McConnell Air Force Base.

Four people were killed in Sedgwick County.

The tornado then grew to F-5 intensity and went through the community of Andover in Butler county. Major damage was incurred and a total of 13 people were killed.

At the same time, another tornado developed in Cowley county and moved northeast. It grew to F-4 intensity, killing one person east of Winfield, and another near Howard, in Elk county.

Total property damage from these tornadoes were in excess of $272 million.
