John McCain criticized the leading Republican presidential candidates Tuesday for their positive statements on waterboarding and torture, calling such comments \u201cloose talk\u201d that goes against American values.\n\nIn the GOP presidential debate Saturday night, Donald Trump, the front-runner in Tuesday\u2019s New Hampshire primary, said he would bring back waterboarding and \u201ca hell of a lot worse than waterboarding\u201d if elected president. Sen. Ted Cruz, who won the Iowa caucuses last week, said that waterboarding didn\u2019t amount to torture, but is simply enhanced interrogation, though he said he wouldn\u2019t bring back its widespread use.\n\nCruz did add, however, that facing an imminent attack, he \u201cwould use whatever enhanced interrogation methods we could to keep this country safe.\u201d\n\nMcCain, a Vietnam veteran who spent five years as a prisoner of war, called the comments from his party\u2019s top candidates \u201cdisappointing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might be easy to dismiss this bluster as cheap campaign rhetoric, but these statements must not go unanswered because they mislead the American people about the realities of interrogation, how to gather intelligence, what it takes to defend our security and, at the most fundamental level, what we are fighting for as a nation and what kind of nation we are,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Arizona Republican made his remarks on the Senate floor the same day New Hampshire voters are headed to the polls for the first-in-the-nation primary. McCain is popular figure in that state and won its primary during both his 2000 and 2008 presidential bids.\n\nMcCain and Cruz have a well-established antagonistic relationship in the Senate, and they have often butted heads, most notably over the Texas senator\u2019s role in forcing the 2013 government shutdown over the Affordable Care Act. Trump has also been at odds with McCain \u2013 the real estate magnate called him a \u201closer\u201d last year and said he wasn\u2019t a war hero because he got captured, a statement that was widely panned by Republicans and Democrats alike.\n\nMcCain has not endorsed a GOP presidential candidate after his friend Sen. Lindsey Graham dropped out.\n\nIn his statement Tuesday, McCain said the use of torture in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks did little to produce \u201cactionable intelligence\u201d in the fight against al-Qaeda, but rather \u201ccompromised our values, stained our national honor and did little practical good.\"\n\nHe dismissed Cruz\u2019s notion that waterboarding doesn\u2019t amount to torture, saying the \u201cpractice, which is a simulated execution by drowning, amounts to torture as any reasonable person would define it\u201d and as it\u2019s defined in the Geneva Conventions.\n\nHe noted it is \u201can insult\u201d to intelligence officers who do their jobs without using enhanced interrogation methods \u201cto assert we can\u2019t win this war on terrorism without using such methods. Yes, we can and we will.\"\n\nMcCain, who was his party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2008, cited the fact that the annual defense authorization measure signed into law last year specifically banned torture, limiting interrogation methods to those in the Army\u2019s field manual. McCain needled the candidates by suggesting they would go beyond the law in allowing the interrogation practices.\n\n\u201cNow candidates are saying they will disregard the law,\u201d McCain said. \u201cI thought that was our complaint, Republican complaint, with the present president of the United States.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
