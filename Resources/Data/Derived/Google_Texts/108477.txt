To ensure that continuing medical education remains relevant to today’s healthcare professionals and their patients, CME providers must first understand the forces that are driving change in the way healthcare is now perceived and delivered in the U.S.

As the Affordable Care Act has taken effect, healthcare organizations must become performing accountable care organizations, or ACOs, to be competitive. Those who plan medical and healthcare meetings are feeling the impact of that altering landscape and its new requirements. Simultaneously, healthcare professionals must deal with cultural and business-related forces that also are reshaping healthcare.

In this article, part one of a three-part series based on a recent MeetingsNet webinar, Jeff Hurt, Velvet Chainsaw Consulting’s executive vice president of education and engagement, details six trends that are driving change in healthcare—and healthcare continuing professional development. In part two, Hurt explains how continuing healthcare professional development must shift as well to meet the needs of today’s HCPs. Part three provides some techniques you can use to align your educational activities with the needs of your HCP learners. Also, check out the Learner’s Bill of Rights Hurt and the audience developed during the webinar.
