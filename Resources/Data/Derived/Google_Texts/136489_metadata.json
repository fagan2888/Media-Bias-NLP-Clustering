Like Trujillo, a 29-year-old mother of three who had to let her breast cancer go untreated for months because she wasn\u2019t insured, they will largely have to rely on the power of prayer to keep themselves healthy and alive.\n\nThe complex health care legislation originally had two solutions for people who didn\u2019t have health coverage through their work. Middle-income earners could shop for plans in an online marketplace, with some able to receive a federal subsidy to help pay for it.\n\nFor the most down and out, states would expand Medicaid \u2014 as Nevada has \u2014 to cover them.\n\nBut the U.S. Supreme Court made that optional, so 25 states are not expanding Medicaid, even though the federal government will pay 100 percent of the expansion for the first three years (gradually reducing it to 90 percent by 2020).\n\nAlthough several studies have shown that the financial benefits of the program outweigh additional financial burdens on states, several governors either believe there are additional costs they can\u2019t afford or are ideologically opposed to more reliance on the federal government.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe there are other women who will have to go through what I have,\u201d Trujillo said.\n\nOh, but they will. A recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that at least 5 million people nationwide, the vast majority of them either African-American or Hispanic, will be left without coverage because states aren\u2019t expanding Medicaid.\n\n(Other studies have shown that the number of uninsured in the country could remain as high as 30 million when you consider growing numbers of undocumented immigrants and those who fall through the cracks created by inconsistencies between state and federal guidelines for who qualifies for assistance.)\n\nAll but three of the world\u2019s 30 developed nations that are members of the influential Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have universal health coverage \u2014 Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The only three lacking universal health coverage: Mexico, Turkey and the U.S.\n\nMexico and Turkey have long had the excuse of poor economies. The U.S., however, has always come with a variety of excuses, including the threats of \u201csocialism\u201d and \u201cthe death of the physician-patient relationship,\u201d but the truth is that intertwined political and commercial interests have killed universal health care.\n\nThe U.S. spends twice the amount on health care per capita than any other country \u2014 more than the next 10 countries combined, and ranks dead last in the quality of health care among industrialized countries, according to studies by the consulting firm McKinsey &Co.\n\nEven President Barack Obama, whose Affordable Care Act tries to navigate the special interest lobbies that keep politicians in office with their contributions, recognizes his legislation isn\u2019t universal health care.\n\n\u201cI want to cover everybody,\u201d he said in 2009. \u201cNow the truth is unless you have what\u2019s called a single-payer system in which everyone\u2019s automatically covered, you\u2019re probably not going to reach every single individual.\u201d\n\nHow Trujillo wishes all Americans could be covered, so they could be spared her ordeal.\n\nIn July 2012 Trujillo was exercising at home when she discovered that she had two lumps in her right breast, each the size of a quarter.\n\nLaid off from a job without health benefits \u2014 husband Jorge Guevara\u2019s construction job also didn\u2019t offer them \u2014 Trujillo didn\u2019t have insurance coverage or money to pay for care.\n\nUnable to get Medicaid \u2014 workers there told her she would get that insurance if she became pregnant again \u2014 Trujillo prayed she could find a job with insurance. She did, but it wasn\u2019t until five months after she discovered her lumps \u2014 by that time one was as large as an orange \u2014 that she received the surgical, drug and radiation treatment necessary.\n\nShe was stage 4 when she presented herself to doctors. She has gotten insurance through the state exchange, but the cancer has spread to her bones. Doctors don\u2019t know how much time she has left.\n\nTrujillo and her family pray for a miracle.\n\nI agree with Trujillo \u2014 it is time, actually well past time, for universal health coverage in the U.S. No one should have to go through what she is going through.\n\nDuring a December event for prostate cancer survivors in Seattle, Colin Powell, a retired general, prostate cancer survivor and the former secretary of state under George W. Bush, pointed out that other developed nations, including Canada and countries in Europe, make government-funded health coverage available to all their citizens through a single-payer system (basically an expanded and better version of Medicare).\n\n\u201cWe are a wealthy enough country with the capacity to make sure that every one of our fellow citizens has access to quality health care,\u201d Powell said. \u201c(Let\u2019s show) the rest of the world what our democratic system is all about and how we take care of our citizens.\u201d\n\nAmen.\n\nPaul Harasim is the medical writer for the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
