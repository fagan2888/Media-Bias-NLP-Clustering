Other difficulties included cash flow, credit financing, marketing and adhering to government regulations.\n\nWhen asked about what challenges they face as small business owners, 5% of respondents said they had none.\n\nOptimism rates of small business owners are now at the highest level since the recession hit in 2008, according to the Wells Fargo/Gallup Small Business Index.
