But we want action. We are tired of words and evasion.\u201d\n\nThirty-eight national press groups and transparency organizations, including the Society of Professional Journalists and the Poynter Institute, sent a letter to the White House in July criticizing the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cpolitically driven suppression of news and information about federal agencies.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver the past two decades, public agencies have increasingly prohibited staff from communicating with journalists unless they go through public affairs offices or through political appointees,\u201d the letter reads. \u201cThis trend has been especially pronounced in the federal government. We consider these restrictions a form of censorship\u2014an attempt to control what the public is allowed to see and hear.\u201d\n\nEarnest\u2019s letter did not address the administration\u2019s public affairs policies.\n\nUpon entering office, President Obama pledged to run \u201cthe most transparent administration in history,\u201d but many press groups and transparency advocates say the Obama administration has fallen far short of its lofty goals.\n\n\u201cI spoke every day almost to our national security team in Washington,\u201d ex-New York Times editor Jill Abramson said in a July interview on Fox News. \u201cAll of the reporters said to me there\u2019s never been a more difficult atmosphere in which to do the work they do than now.\u201d\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists released a scathing report last year on the Obama administration, painting the White House as vindictive and controlling.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration\u2019s aggressive war on leaks, and its determined efforts to control information that the news media needs to hold the government accountable for its actions, are without equal since the Nixon administration and in direct conflict with President Obama\u2019s often-stated goal of making his administration the most transparent in American history,\u201d former Washington Post executive editor and report author Leonard Downie, Jr. said.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The White House responded Monday to criticism from dozens of leading press organizations and transparency groups, saying it has improved access to public officials, whistleblower protections, and decl", "title": "Journalists: White House Defense of Transparency Record \u2018Typical Spin\u2019", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/journalists-white-house-defense-of-transparency-record-typical-spin/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AP081021042924-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The White House responded Monday to criticism from dozens of leading press organizations and transpa", "title": "Journalists: White House Defense of Transparency Record \u2018Typical Spin\u2019", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/AP081021042924-150x150.jpg", "creator": "@cjciaramella", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdffb9\"", "article_summary": "BY: Follow @cjciaramellaThe White House responded Monday to criticism from dozens of leading press organizations and transparency groups, saying it has improved access to public officials, whistleblower protections, and declassified documents.\nUpon entering office, President Obama pledged to run \u201cthe most transparent administration in history,\u201d but many press groups and transparency advocates say the Obama administration has fallen far short of its lofty goals.\nSPJ president David Cuillier called the White House letter \u201ctypical spin and response through non-response.\u201d\u201cWhile we applaud efforts to people\u2019s access to their government through websites and FOIA, nowhere does the White House address specific concerns about excessive message management and preventing journalists from getting information on behalf of citizens,\u201d Cuillier said in a statement.\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful the administration is sincere in its promise to increase openness and rectify the problems.\n\u201cAll of the reporters said to me there\u2019s never been a more difficult atmosphere in which to do the work they do than now.\u201dThe Committee to Protect Journalists released a scathing report last year on the Obama administration, painting the White House as vindictive and controlling."}
