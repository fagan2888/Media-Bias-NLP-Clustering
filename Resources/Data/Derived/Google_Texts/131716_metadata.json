For better or worse there\u2019s much more of a contest on the Right to see who will be the party\u2019s nominee in 2016. Better because it allows the party to avoid the tasteless spectacle of having a candidate polish her scepter in the back of a Scooby Doo van. Worse because it means that anyone seeking the nomination has to preserve a shred of dignity for the general election while still winning the support of voters who chant \u201ckeep your government hands off my Medicare\u201d and mean it.\n\nEconomically there\u2019s not a whole lot of daylight between many of the Republican candidates. Much as with the Democrats, the party is coalescing around a few general principles, and for pocketbook voters, the big choice will really be Blue Team or Red. Still, there are some variations on the theme, and those can matter. Below MainStreet has broken each candidate down into our three almost-certainly speculative categories.\n\nLet\u2019s get to it.\n\nJeb Bush\n\nBig Picture \u2013 A hard return to supply side tax theory, which means heavy cuts focused largely at the top. Although Bush is trying to position himself as a new breed of Republican, different from his brother or Mitt Romney, his advisors have largely been assembled from the teams of George W. Bush and Romney. In particular, Columbia Business School Dean Glenn Hubbard has a large role in the nascent campaign. Although we don\u2019t know any details yet, Hubbard was a major author of Romney\u2019s tax plan in 2012, and the bones of his economic thinking will almost certainly play a role in Bush\u2019s.", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "Which Republican candidate would be most beneficial for your finances?", "author": "Eric Reed", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Which Republican candidate would be most beneficial for your finances?", "title": "What Would Each Republican Presidential Candidate Mean for Your Wallet?", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/what-would-each-republican-presidential-candidate-mean-for-your-wallet", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/marcorubio.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/marcorubio.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Financial Planning", "keywords": "politics, 2016, Republicans, election, President, student loans, taxes, marco rubio, chris christie president, jeb bush president, ted cruz president", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Financial Planning", "tag": "ted cruz president", "published_time": "2015-05-01T11:57Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1611368"}, "date": "2015-05-01T11:57Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13134564, "twitter": {"description": "Which Republican candidate would be most beneficial for your finances?", "title": "What Would Each Republican Presidential Candidate Mean for Your Wallet?", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/what-would-each-republican-presidential-candidate-mean-for-your-wallet", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/marcorubio.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/marcorubio.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "politics, 2016, Republicans, election, President, student loans, taxes, marco rubio, chris christie president, jeb bush president, ted cruz president"}, "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTNEW YORK (MainStreet) \u2014 The Republican cohort of presidential candidates is considerably more fleshed out than that of the Democrats.\nFor better or worse there\u2019s much more of a contest on the Right to see who will be the party\u2019s nominee in 2016.\nJeb BushBig Picture \u2013 A hard return to supply side tax theory, which means heavy cuts focused largely at the top.\nEconomically there\u2019s not a whole lot of daylight between many of the Republican candidates.\nBetter because it allows the party to avoid the tasteless spectacle of having a candidate polish her scepter in the back of a Scooby Doo van."}
