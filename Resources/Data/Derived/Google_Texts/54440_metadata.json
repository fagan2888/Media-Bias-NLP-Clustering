The group was also a major supporter of a single payer health care plan.\n\nSterling decided to wind down the operation when two of the major sources of funding came up for renewal, he said in a phone interview Monday.\n\nThe organization was funded primarily by a navigator grant, which aims to expand coverage under the Affordable Care Act. A smaller grant from the American Heart Association funded a push for a sugary drinks excise tax.\n\nLooking forward, Sterling said he does not expect the Legislature to take on some of the major issues about access to health care in the second half of the biennium.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the 2016 session as one where there\u2019s potential for major reform in health care,\u201d Sterling said.\n\nThe high price of premiums continues to make health care prohibitive for many Vermonters, he said. However, reluctance among lawmakers to raise new revenues will make it difficult to address issues of access, he said.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s time for someone else to go to fight legislative leadership,\u201d Sterling said.\n\nThe Vermont Campaign for Health Care Security pushed for extending Medicaid eligibility and improving access to health care. The Campaign also advocated for a single payer health care system. In December, Gov. Peter Shumlin pulled the plug on a plan to replace the health insurance premium system with a tax-funded program.\n\nThe organization played a role in creating subsidy programs to offset premium costs in Vermont Health Connect. It also pushed for pregnant women to receive dental coverage under Dr. Dynasaur, according to a news release.\n\nThe Vermont NEA, long an advocate for publicly funded universal health care, supported VCHCS from its inception.\n\nDarren Allen, Vermont NEA spokesperson, said the campaign is leaving on a high note, noting that there have been many health care victories in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe landscape has changed significantly over the last decade in health care reform,\u201d Allen said\n\nAllen said the Vermont NEA is wary of new health care reform proposals as the state has faced budget shortages in recent years. Lawmakers\u2019 resistance to raising new revenue has made it \u201calmost impossible\u201d to expand programs, Allen said.\n\nRep. Bill Lippert, D-Hinesburg, who heads the House Health Care Committee, said that he and his Senate counterpart, Sen. Claire Ayer, D-Addison, initially pushed for a plan that would have addressed the Medicaid cost shift last legislative session.\n\nLippert said that there are significant items on the agenda that lawmakers and the Shumlin administration need to address. He pointed to Gov. Peter Shumlin\u2019s fall deadline for Vermont Health Connect, at which point Vermont could switch to a federal exchange model.\n\nLawmakers will also be reviewing a study of universal primary health coverage, he said.\n\n\u201cI think there are significant health care issues which the Legislature needs to be actively involved in with the administration,\u201d Lippert said.\n\nTrinka Kerr, a health care advocate with Vermont Legal Aid, said that she was not surprised to hear that the campaign was closing down in the wake of Shumlin\u2019s announcement that he would no longer seek to implement a single payer system.\n\nKerr said that the state is still evaluating what steps should come next.\n\n\u201cI think after the failure of the grand plan, I think everybody is falling back and regrouping and rethinking what to do next,\u201d Kerr said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vermont Campaign for Health Care Security to quit after a decade of promoting better health coverage", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "Vermont Campaign for Health Care Security to quit after a decade of promoting better health coverage", "title": "Health care advocacy group to shut down | VTDigger", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sterling.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-28T10:10:21+00:00", "url": "http://vtdigger.org/2015/07/27/health-care-advocacy-group-to-shut-down/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vermont Campaign for Health Care Security to quit after a decade of promoting better health coverage", "creator": "@emhew", "image": "http://i0.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Sterling.jpg?fit=1024%2C681", "title": "Health care advocacy group to shut down | VTDigger", "site": "@vtdigger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vtdigger", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "single payer", "published_time": "2015-07-27T17:43:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-28T10:10:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "vermont campaign for health care security, single payer, peter sterling, health care reform, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdbfb\"", "article_summary": "The Vermont Campaign for Health Care Security pushed for extending Medicaid eligibility and improving access to health care.\nAn advocacy group that has pushed for health care expansion for almost a decade will close its doors next month.\n\u201cThe landscape has changed significantly over the last decade in health care reform,\u201d Allen saidAllen said the Vermont NEA is wary of new health care reform proposals as the state has faced budget shortages in recent years.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the 2016 session as one where there\u2019s potential for major reform in health care,\u201d Sterling said.\nThe group was also a major supporter of a single payer health care plan."}
