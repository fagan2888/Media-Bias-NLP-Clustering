Tenet Healthcare Corp. has said that it believes the share of exchange business that UnitedHealth Group Inc. currently holds will be absorbed once the latter exits the market.

According to Reuters, UnitedHealth, which is one of the largest sellers of plans on the exchanges, plans to stop selling individual insurance coverage through the program next year in most states. Losses are the reason for its decision, the company said.
