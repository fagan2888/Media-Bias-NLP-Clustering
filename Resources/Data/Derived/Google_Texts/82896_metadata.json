Well, kinda.\n\nThe Lamar Lady Savages who made their way into the Tiger Den on Saturday are a far different team \u2014 down five seniors and four starters from last year \u2014 than the one that defeated Sterling 43-41 in the 2014 Class 3A state tournament third-place game.\n\nBut what Saturday's 33-26 win for the top-seeded Tigers over No. 16 seed Lamar in the Class 3A \"Sweet 16\" game did provide was another step.\n\nOne big step, granted, in a goal set in motion by the Tigers since the moment they left the Colorado School of Mines campus back on March 15, 2014 \u2014 the last time they've left any gym in defeat \u2014 as Sterling punched its bus ticket back to the Great 8 and to Golden, the site of the Class 3A state tournament final rounds.\n\n\"One of the things we've talked about from day one is that 'We want a chance (to win state),'\" said Sterling head coach Kent Chrisman. \"Well, now we're there and we'll have a chance.\"\n\nAnd the Tigers did so on a day where their leading scorer, junior Jenna Knudson (17.4 points per game), was limited to just two points, a layup with 2:50 remaining in the first half that put Sterling up 15-12.\n\n\"Bottom line, she did other things to help us win,\" said Chrisman about Jenna. \"She made good decisions in our offense, she played great defense. It was just one of those days where her shooting stroke wasn't there.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAside from a game-high 16-point effort from Sterling sophomore Kylie Chavez, and 13 points from Lamar's Courtney Clark \u2014 10 of which came in the first half \u2014 it wasn't a great shooting day for any player on the court as defense reigned supreme on Saturday.\n\nSterling carried a narrow 19-16 lead into the half-time locker rooms.\n\nFans may have been nervous. The Tigers were not.\n\nSterling junior Jenna Knudson (left) and Lamar sophomore Brenna Vallejos (right) battle for a loose ball during Saturday's Class 3A state tournament Sweet 16 game. Sterling defeated Lamar 33-26. (David Wilson / Sterling Journal-Advocate)\n\n\"I walked in (the locker rooms) and the girls were pumped up, ready to go and already talking about the first five minutes of the third quarter and importance of setting the tone,\" Chrisman said. \"You hold a team to 16 points in a half, you're doing something right. And Lamar held us to 19 points, so it was doing something right, defensively, as well. We just made a couple tweaks and the girls did a good job in the second half.\"\n\nSterling started the third quarter on a mini 6-2 run, coming on back-to-back baskets from sophomore Taylor Knudson, who scored seven points, and a put-back from Chavez at the 5:03 mark to up the lead to 25-18.\n\nThe Tigers held a 27-21 advantage at the end of the third, then turned to their trusted \"five-game,\" a five-out offense to bleed the clock out on the Lady Savages in the fourth quarter.\n\nBrenna Vallejos banked in a 3-pointer with 1:25 remaining to pull Lamar within four points at 30-26, but Sterling freshman Brooke Polenz made 1-of-2 free throws with 29 seconds remaining, and Chavez buried a pair of free throws with two seconds remaining, to put the bow on the 33-26 final.\n\nSterling will now get a few days to celebrate, and get back in the gym, before it heads off to Golden for its Class 3A Great 8 game on Thursday against No. 25 seed Liberty Common, which upset No. 8 Bennett (67-51) and No. 9 St. Mary's (58-51) in its sub-region.\n\nTip-off between the Tigers (24-0, 16-0 Patriot League) and the Lady Eagles (18-5 overall, 11-0 3A/2A/1A Mile High) will be at 11:45 a.m. on Thursday inside Lockridge Arena on the Colorado School of Mines campus.\n\n\"We break everything down into seasons. Our first season, the regular season, is accomplished. The second season: the district tournament. And the first two rounds of state is our third season,\" Chrisman said. \"We're fortunate enough now that we get a fourth season. And once you're there at state, I don't care who you are, anything can happen. We've given ourselves a chance and we'll see what happens.\"\n\nDavid Wilson: 970-526-9285, dwilson@journal-advocate.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sports/ci_27673238/tigers-claw-their-way-into-great-8", "sailthru.author": "By David Wilson \n \n  Journal-Advocate sports writer", "ag": {"canon": "JournalAdvocate:article:27673238:view"}, "startDate": "2015-03-08T21:25:03-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "journal-advocate.com", "description": "Revenge?
