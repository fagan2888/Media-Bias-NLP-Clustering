The department released information about rates for individual and small business plans before the Nov. 1 start of open enrollment for the plans, which are sold on healthcare.gov.\n\nHighmark said treatment costs for marketplace enrollees exceeded premiums by about $318 million for the first six months of this year, a deficit driven by high rates of hospitalization and claims related to cancer, congestive heart failure and other chronic conditions. Geisinger said it, too, paid more for care than it collected.\n\nBoth companies said they were dropping some plans they planned to offer in 2016, in part because the department limited the amount by which they could increase premiums. Highmark has added plans with new benefit designs, including its Community Blue Flex plan that has three tiers of costs for doctors and hospitals, rather than traditional in-network and out-of-network rates.\n\n\u201cThe action that we need to take to keep plans financially viable is to modify the offerings,\u201d said Highmark spokesman Aaron Billger.\n\nHighmark enrolled more people than any other insurer in the state in the federal health law's first open enrollment period by offering some of the lowest premiums for 2014. The nonprofit increased costs for 2015, and competitor UPMC Health Plan gained market share by selling cheaper plans.\n\nUPMC Health Plan will offer the lowest-cost \u201csilver\u201d plan \u2014 a popular type of mid-range plan sold on the marketplace \u2014 in southwestern Pennsylvania next year. A 40-year-old non-smoker would pay $187 per month for the plan. Highmark's lowest-cost silver plan in the same area will cost about $211 per month.\n\n\u201cWe think we're very well positioned in the market,\u201d said UPMC Health Plan spokeswoman Gina Pferdehirt. \u201cThe lowest-priced silver plans, people seem to respond to well.\u201d\n\nUPMC Health Plan kept increases below 10 percent for all its plans, Pferdehirt said.\n\n\u201cWe are working to guarantee that Pennsylvanians can continue to shop for their best coverage options in a competitive insurance marketplace, while still paying reasonable prices,\u201d Gov. Tom Wolf wrote in a news release.\n\nBut increases of more than 20 percent are still large, said Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania President Sam Marshall.\n\n\u201cWe obviously still have a ways to go in terms of keeping insurance affordable,\u201d he said. \u201cThose were thoroughly reviewed rates, and they come with some sizable increases.\u201d\n\nThe federal Department of Health and Human Services announced Thursday that it expects about 10 million people to have enrolled in marketplace plans by the end of 2016, up from the 9.1 million enrolled this year.\n\nOf the 19 companies selling individual health insurance plans in Pennsylvania on the Affordable Care Act's marketplace next year, seven are increasing premiums by more than 10 percent, according to the release. All 23 companies that sell plans to businesses with fewer than 50 employees are increasing premiums by less than 10 percent, according to the release. The insurance department asked six insurers that requested increases of more than 25 percent to limit the increases, noting that they could seek more increases in the future.\n\nConsumer advocacy organizations encourage people with Affordable Care Act plans to check whether their costs are increasing and to consider switching plans if they can save money.\n\n\u201cIf individuals are unhappy with how plans have changed their options or that the price has gone up, they should definitely shop around,\u201d said Antoinette Kraus, director of Pennsylvania Health Access Network.\n\nFor 2015, the average monthly premium is $222 for Pennsylvania's lowest-cost silver plan, one of the most popular sold on the marketplace. But about 80 percent of people who are eligible for marketplace coverage are eligible for tax credits that lower their monthly premiums, according to HHS. Average premiums for 2016 are not yet available.\n\nKraus noted that most consumers will pay smaller increases than the insurers requested since the tax credits are based on income.\n\nWes Venteicher is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
