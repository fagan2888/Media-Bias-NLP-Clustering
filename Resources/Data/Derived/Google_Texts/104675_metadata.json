The portfolio manager says he prefers \u201cstocks that you can buy, put away and hold for a long period of time.\u201d\n\nOne such stock, he says, is the Canadian-born, now U.S.-based Catamaran.\n\nZechner, says he has no worries about the company\u2019s long term viability, but did have some short term concerns because of the slow implementation of \u201cObamacare\u201d in the U.S . But those were allayed, he says, when the company \u201cblew through\u201d the street\u2019s expectation\u2019s with its most recent quarterly report.\n\nOn May 1st, Catamaran reported its Q1, 2014. The company earned $77.34-million on revenue of $4.9-billion, a topline that was up 53% over the same period last year.\n\nZechner thinks investors should take advantage of the current price of Catamaran\u2019s stock, which he consider to be low.\n\n\u201cThe stock has stalled out,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting it at under twenty times earnings. This to me a buy and a put away.\u201d\n\nCatamaran, previously known as SXC Health, is the number three Pharmacy Benefits Manager, or PBM in the United States. PBMs are third party administrators of prescription drug programs, and are responsible for processing and paying prescription drug claims. The sector was shaken up early in 2012 when the merger of Express Scripts and Medco got the green light from US antitrust regulators and created a leader that boasted combined revenues of $116-billion, topping the space\u2019s number two, CVS Caremark, which was the result of a merger between the large drugstore chain that was CVS and pharmacy benefits manager Caremark. CVS Caremark is now the second-largest competitor with $107 billion in revenues, and itself the subject of antitrust debate.\n\nFounded in 1993, J Zechner Associates manages over $2 billion in assets.\n\nAt press time, shares of Catamaran on the TSX were down 1% to $45.90.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Cantech Letter", "description": "Catamaran (TSX:CCT) and Google couldn\u2019t be further apart in terms of the corners of the technology space they occupy, but they have one thing in common, says one portfolio manager; they are both outstanding long-term investments.
