A San Antonio-based company has opened Complete Emergency Care, a stand-alone emergency room, in West El Paso. Amy Hernandez, director of nursing at Complete Emergency Care, center, cut the ribbon on the facility at 655 Redd Rd. on Sept. 26.

Hernandez said the company’s research showed a need for stand-alone emergency room in the community. With almost everything except an attached hospital, it advertises speedier and less expensive care than a hospital ER, is never closed and is staffed by an emergency doctor, but does not treat trauma or receive patients by ambulance.

The opening is part of a boom in urgent care centers and stand-alone emergency rooms in El Paso, as competition for market share heats up. Estimates say about a third of the local population is uninsured, a figure that’s expected to change as people sign up for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
