The Census website, for example, is closed. Please do what you can on the assignment. Those parts that you\u2019re unable to do because of the shutdown will have to wait until Congress decides we actually need a government. Please listen to the news and be prepared to turn in the assignment quickly once our nation re-opens. Rachel\n\nMedia Trackers then forwarded the email to Joe Gow, the school\u2019s chancellor, who agreed that the email was too pointed and inappropriate for the classroom.\n\n\u201cI share your concerns about the inappropriate use of the overly partisan phrase \u2018Republican tea party controlled House of Representatives\u2019 in a message purported to have been sent by a UW-L instructor to a class of students,\u201d Gow responded to Media Trackers via email.\n\nGow also called on the school\u2019s dean to launch an investigation into the email, which he confirmed to Media Trackers later in the day. \u201cI have just spoken to the College Dean, who has now called the professor, verified the authenticity of the note, pointed out the inappropriateness of the politically partisan language, and obtained the professor\u2019s commitment to writing a follow-up apology to the class.\u201d\n\nAs requested, Slocum sent a follow-up email to her students the next day. That email, however, only added more fuel to the as it served \u2013 by her own admission \u2013 as \u201ca more thorough, less annoyed version of shutdown events.\u201d Not only did she provide other reasons for why she believes the House GOP is responsible for the now week-long government shutdown, but she noted as well that Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Republican, has openly criticized the shutdown.\n\n\u201cMany are not happy with this all or nothing style that people on the far right (who refer to themselves as the Tea Party) are advocating,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt is true that I am dismayed that you cannot easily do the assignment. My opinion is that this shutdown is a bad idea.\u201d\n\nTo her students dismay, however, she never specifically stated in the email which government official(s) chose to close the census website that the students needed to complete their assignment. She also pleads with her class to keep the emails secret from \u201cconservative blogs or list servs.\u201d\n\nHere is the complete text of the second email, entitled \u201cCensus data assignment\u201d:\n\nhi everyone, The email I sent you all about the government shut down [sic] was not meant to be partisan, but it may have come across that way. The following is a more thorough, less annoyed version of shutdown events. It\u2019s part of the democratic process for Congress to be able to shut down the government by not raising the debt ceiling or allowing the passage of a temporary budget (continuing resolution) that keeps the government open. Typically, Congress easily passes legislation to allow the government to borrow and to keep it running until an actual budget is hammered out. Today the reason the government has shutdown is because Republicans want Democrats to agree to signficant [sic] changes to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). They have control of the House. Democrats argue that the ACA just went into effect on October 1st so we haven\u2019t yet seen what needs to be changed. They won\u2019t agree to these big changes (like delaying the ACA for a year or stripping it of funding) nor will the president. Consequently, the Senate rejected the House bill, there was no Continuing Resolution, and the government was forced to close. Incidentally, within the Republican party, there was disagreement over whether to shut down the government. McCain for instance was opposed along with other Senate Republicans. It\u2019s important to recognize that within the Republican party there is disagreement over how to govern. Many are not happy with this all or nothing style that people on the far right (who refer to themselves as the Tea Party) are advocating. This is, in essence, the argument made by conservative columnist David Brooks. It is true that I am dismayed that you cannot easily do the assignment. My opinion is that this shutdown is a bad idea. If you want to discuss all of this, let me know and I can make an internal (D2L) discussion board about it. But please don\u2019t forward my emails to conservative blogs or list servs and I will make sure my emails explain things fully. Here\u2019s hoping you can get to the assignment this week. Rachel\n\nAccording to the university\u2019s website, Slocum received both her Ph.D. and M.A. degrees from Clark University in Worcester, Mass. She also has a bachelor\u2019s degree from McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and spent several years as a Peace Corps volunteer in Niger between her graduate and undergraduate degrees.\n\nh/t The Daily Caller", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "A professor at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse used a botched class assignment last week to place the entirety of the blame for the current government shutdown on Congressional Republicans.", "title": "Univ. of Wisconsin professor uses class assignment to attribute...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 380, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2013/10/Dr.-Rachel-Slocum-Univ-of-Wisconsin-email-e1381168807843-793x10241-e1381169816897-380x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2013/10/07/univ-of-wisconsin-professor-uses-class-assignment-to-attribute-blame-for-govt-shutdown-to-republicans/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "university-of-wisconsin-la-crosse", "published_time": "2013-10-07T12:56:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-07T17:59:11+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ca6\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s important to recognize that within the Republican party there is disagreement over how to govern.\nIncidentally, within the Republican party, there was disagreement over whether to shut down the government.\nA professor at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse used a botched class assignment last week to place the entirety of the blame for the current government shutdown on Congressional Republicans.\nPlease listen to the news and be prepared to turn in the assignment quickly once our nation re-opens.\nThose parts that you\u2019re unable to do because of the shutdown will have to wait until Congress decides we actually need a government."}
