Beginning next year, the act carries penalties for those who remain uninsured.\n\nThe Texas state health department estimates there were 176,402 uninsured people in El Paso County in April \u2013 roughly a quarter of the population \u2013 Slaughter said. She added that local estimates place the number of uninsured El Pasoans closer to a third of the population.\n\nUrgent care centers act like a relief valve, filling the gap between primary care and hospital emergency rooms, which are overcrowded, said J. Eric Evans, CEO of Sierra Providence Health Network.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to decongest some of that,\u201d Evans said. \u201cUrgent care is designed to be a low-cost option to an emergency room visit. It is also designed for convenience because most doctors\u2019 offices aren\u2019t open until 9 p.m.; they aren\u2019t open on weekends.\u201d\n\nThey treat the most common maladies \u2013 sinus infections, fevers, sprains, back pain and cuts. Some also perform basic tests, such as blood, pregnancy and urine tests.\n\nThe cost for treatment is generally similar to a primary care visit but less than the emergency room. Patients are often seen by nurse practitioners.\n\nUrgent care surge\n\nAn Internet search turns up 10 urgent care centers in El Paso, including a pediatric night clinic.\n\nLocally owned Upper Valley Urgent Care Center at 121 E. Redd Road doubled in size last year, expanding from 10 to 20 treatment rooms.\n\nAnd this week, a San Antonio-based company holds a grand opening celebration for its new stand-alone emergency room, Complete Emergency Care, located in a shopping center behind a Jack in the Box and Dunkin\u2019 Donuts on Redd Road on the Westside.\n\nIt has almost everything except an attached hospital. It advertises speedier and less expensive care than a hospital ER, is never closed and is staffed by an emergency doctor. However, it does not treat trauma or receive patients by ambulance.\n\nStand-alone emergency rooms, like urgent care centers, are popping up across the country and there are several in other Texas cities like Houston and Dallas.\n\n\u201cThey saw that we did not have a (stand-alone emergency room) in the city and there was a need for it in the community,\u201d said Amy Hernandez, director of nursing at Complete Emergency Care.\n\nHernandez has a bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing from the University of Texas at El Paso and has worked as an emergency nurse in El Paso for 14 years.\n\n\u201cThey did a lot of research,\u201d she said, \u201clooking at geographic and demographic data for our city, and noticed that for the people who lived on the Far Westside, their closest (emergency) facility was Providence Memorial Hospital,\u201d Hernandez said.\n\nProvidence is about 10 miles southwest of the new stand-alone ER, and there is a lot of new development planned in Far West El Paso, including a new hospital.\n\nHernandez would not disclose prices but said they are \u201csubstantially lower\u201d than a hospital ER. She expects the center to see 50 to 60 patients a day.\n\nPatients needing inpatient care would be taken to Providence Memorial Hospital, which has an agreement with the company, said Evans, the hospital\u2019s CEO.\n\n\u201cA lot of the emergencies don\u2019t end up being admitted. They can be stabilized, treated and sent home,\u201d Evans said.\n\nSierra Providence Health Network, one of the city\u2019s largest hospital chains, has also recognized the opportunity and is making its own move into the market.\n\nIt is transitioning its urgent care location in Northeast El Paso, opened in 2011, into a satellite emergency department, according to Evans.\n\n\u201cThere really is a need for people to get access to care at a convenient, after-hours, location,\u201d Evans said.\n\nBilling trouble\n\nA year ago, a 39-year-old El Paso woman with an ear ache went to the urgent care center Sierra Providence operates on Sunland Park Drive on the Westside.\n\nAfter a 15-minute visit with a doctor, the problem was solved with a prescription for an antibiotic. The copay on her insurance was $50. She paid and left.\n\nA few weeks later, the woman was surprised to receive a hospital-type bill from Sierra Medical Center for an additional $55, then a $189.99 bill from the doctor.\n\nAfter disputing the bill with hospital administrators and her insurance company, it was eventually reduced to $50.\n\nFacing more competition and responding to customer complaints, Sierra Providence is retooling the urgent care center, which it opened in February 2012.\n\nThe hospital chain recently sent a letter to patients announcing it has made the urgent care center simpler to use and its prices more competitive with other stand-alone centers by converting it from a department of the hospital to a free-standing center.\n\n\u201cOur rates under this new model are highly competitive with other free-standing, non-hospital affiliate urgent care centers in our area,\u201d the letter says. \u201cAs with these other centers, you can now appreciate one global bill, without the worry of separate facility and provider fees.\u201d\n\nThe other major hospital chain in town, Las Palmas Del Sol Healthcare, which operates Las Palmas and Del Sol hospitals, has not opened any urgent care centers in El Paso, yet.\n\n\u201cWe are currently evaluating the need for additional outpatient access points to our emergency care and are exploring the need to expand our outpatient emergency care footprint,\u201d the hospital said in a statement.\n\nAs for the local county hospital, University Medical Center, it has plans to open three neighborhood healthcare centers throughout the city in a couple years, as well as a satellite emergency room in Northeast El Paso, according to the hospital.\n\nThe neighborhood centers would include primary and specialty physician offices, pharmacies, labs and imaging centers.\n\nThey will be funded by the sale of $152 million in bonds approved by El Paso County Commissioners Court earlier this year. The hospital is also seeking a 2.2- cent tax increase, which county commissioners are scheduled to consider on Monday.\n\nThe urgent care industry represents one of the fastest-growing segments of the American health care system, according to industry research firm IBISWorld. The urgent care business produced $14.5 billion in revenue in 2012.\n\nLast year, there were about 9,000 urgent care centers in the United States. On average, 357 patients visited each center every week, according to the Urgent Care Association of America, or UCAA.\n\nMore than 85 percent of urgent care centers reported expecting growth, primarily in their numbers of visits. However, almost 40 percent are expected to expand their existing location or add another site, according to a UCAA report published last year.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nEmail El Paso Inc. reporter Robert Gray at rsgray@elpasoinc.com or call (915) 534-4422 ext. 105.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "El Paso Inc.", "description": "There is a boom in urgent care centers and stand-alone emergency rooms in El Paso, as competition for market share heats up ahead of next month\u2019s enactment of key provisions of the Affordable Care Act.El Paso has long suffered from one of the worst doctor shortages in the nation, which means doctors are often overworked, waiting rooms are crowded and scheduling medical appointments can be difficult.", "title": "Big growth in El Paso health care", "url": "http://www.elpasoinc.com/news/local_news/article_d3b94c8a-2398-11e3-8304-0019bb30f31a.html", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/elpasoinc.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/ff/8ff0b2d6-2398-11e3-9768-0019bb30f31a/523f0776d070b.preview-300.jpg?resize=300%2C231", "height": 231}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 172555339466240}, "keywords": "local_news,editors_pick,top_story", "news_keywords": "local_news,editors_pick,top_story", "description": "There is a boom in urgent care centers and stand-alone emergency rooms in El Paso, as competition for market share heats up ahead of next month\u2019s enactment of key provisions of the Affordable Care Act.El Paso has long suffered from one of the worst doctor shortages in the nation, which means doctors are often overworked, waiting rooms are crowded and scheduling medical appointments can be difficult."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf7d2\"", "article_summary": "Urgent care surgeAn Internet search turns up 10 urgent care centers in El Paso, including a pediatric night clinic.\nHernandez has a bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing from the University of Texas at El Paso and has worked as an emergency nurse in El Paso for 14 years.\nMore than 85 percent of urgent care centers reported expecting growth, primarily in their numbers of visits.\nThe urgent care industry represents one of the fastest-growing segments of the American health care system, according to industry research firm IBISWorld.\nThe Texas state health department estimates there were 176,402 uninsured people in El Paso County in April \u2013 roughly a quarter of the population \u2013 Slaughter said."}
