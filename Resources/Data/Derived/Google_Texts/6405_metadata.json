Brett Hildabrand (R-Shawnee), Mike Kiegerl (R-Olathe) and Craig McPherson (R-Overland Park), is the latest pushback against the FDA and their controversial methodology of approving drugs for mass consumption.\n\nHB2004 is based off of model legislation offered by the Goldwater Institute. Their model legislation states that \u201ca manufacturer of an investigational drug, biological product, or device may make available and an eligible patient may request the manufacturer\u2019s investigational drug, biological product, or device\u201d as long as the patient has a terminal illness and passes other requirements. The actual language for HB2004 is currently unavailable, but it is expected to be very similar to the Goldwater Institute\u2019s version.\n\n\u201cThis is a personal freedom issue. If you have been essentially been given a death sentence from a terminal illness, how dare the government stop you from that treatment,\u201d Rep. Hildabrand said in a Celock Report article about HB2004. \u201cIf it is tied up in government bureaucracy you and I would want every option we have to fight terminal illness.\u201d\n\nRep. Hildabrand\u2019s sentiments in favor of medical freedom and choice are being echoed in state legislatures throughout the country. HB2004 is apart of a greater trend promoting medical freedom that is sweeping the nation. During this most recent November election, Arizona residents approved Prop. 303, known as the Arizona Terminal Patients\u2019 Right to Try Referendum. The proposition allows investigational drugs, biological products or devices to be made available to eligible terminally ill patients, which are not permitted under the FDA. Prop. 303 is similar to laws passed in Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, and Louisiana, known as \u201cRight to Try\u201d laws.\n\nThese laws, though they deal with a small aspect of the FDA\u2019s regulations, provides us with a clear model of how to nullify federal laws that violate the Constitution by narrowing the influence of nullification to limited aspects of the law itself.\n\nThe effectiveness of such nullification laws rests in the obvious logic behind them; dying people should not be deprived of their right to any means that might ease their pain or keep them alive, and it is extremely difficult for opponents to argue that dying people should be forced to use only drugs approved of by bureaucrats who are incapable of empathizing with their possible suffering.\n\nIn Louisiana, for example, the law received 80 percent approval, according to one survey. In three of the states that have passed \u201cRight to Try\u201d laws, not a single politician voted nay. In Michigan, the entire state House voted yea with no abstentions, while only two senators voted against it.\n\nThese types of laws are necessary because of the cumbersome bureaucratic process deployed by the FDA. It can take more than a decade and a billion dollars to get new medications on the market, according to Lucy Caldwell, communications director for the Goldwater Institute.\n\nOne such example is that of Mikaela Knapp, who was diagnosed with kidney cancer.\n\nAccording to a World Net Daily report:\n\nShe and her husband, Keith, launched a social media campaign to lobby drug firms and the FDA to give her access to a new gene therapy. Their efforts gained national attention and generated 200,000 signatures on a petition at Change.org but failed to win access to the treatment. The 25-year-old newlywed died April 24.\n\nUnder a free market (and if the feds adhered to the Constitution) the therapy would have been available for Knapp already. She would not have had to seek anyone\u2019s permission, which she died waiting for.\n\nThis is simply unacceptable. Whatever the dangers inherent in trying experiment drugs, this is a decision that should rest solely with the person consuming the drug, not busybodies, do-gooders, or sanctimonious control freaks.\n\nThere may be those who reject the nullification method and opt instead to work within the system in D.C., but they shouldn\u2019t get their hopes up. In 2003, a federal judge ruled that terminally ill people do not have a right to access to investigational medicine. Not surprisingly, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to consider an appeal on that ruling.\n\nThat is why bills such as HB2004 are so important. Because federal regulatory agencies and courts refuse to show compassion for terminally ill patients, we must step up at the state level to help them. It is truly a matter of life and death.\n\nACTION ITEMS\n\nFor Kansas: Contact your State Representative and politely urge them to co-sponsor HB2004.
