Paul Ryan reminded conservative activists at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference Thursday that the GOP can win in November if it provides Americans with opportunities for prosperity \u2013 especially as the Democratic Party works to refocus itself from Obama\u2019s failures.\n\n\u201cThe party that gives opportunity will win in November; we are that party,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThe left is exhausted, our size is energized\u20262016 will not be a marathon, it will be a 50-yard dash.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will look back in 2014 and say we got it right; we gave people choices and earned back their trust,\u201d he added.\n\nRyan focused his remarks on the fact that Republicans have ideas that will help improve the country, rather than the Obama administration\u2019s stale policies. He pointed out that President Obama has doubled down on his budget plans and continued his focus on income inequality because \u201cthey\u2019re out of ideas\u2026they can\u2019t talk about economic growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cObama will fail in transforming the country, and his agenda will fail,\u201d he added.\n\nThe House Budget Conference Chairman specifically referenced some of the policies that his conservative colleagues are promoting, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott\u2019s push for school choice, Utah Sen. Mike Lee\u2019s desire for more state-controlled highways, Alabama Rep. Martha Roby\u2019s push for a more flexible work week and the \u201ctons of alternatives\u201d to Obamacare that the party has authored over the past few years.\n\nPointing out that \u201cthe GOP is where the action is,\u201d Paul reminded listeners that conservative victories will be achieved with persistence.\n\n\u201cI saw it with my budget, he said. \u201cWhen I introduced it in 2008, I had just eight co-sponsors. The political pros told everyone to stay away. Then the Tea Party members got elected, and now the House has passed it three years in a row. That\u2019s how it always is \u2013 You fight it out. You figure out what works. You come together. Then you win.\u201d\n\nRyan also addressed the growing concerns that the Republican Party is caught in a \u201ccivil war,\u201d saying he doesn\u2019t see a great divide in the party but rather \u201ccreative tension.\u201d He noted that disagreements generally haven\u2019t been over policies, but instead over tactics.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re developing an agenda\u2014a modern, pro-growth, principled agenda for our party. We are going to show the country there\u2019s a better way,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Wisconsin Rep.
