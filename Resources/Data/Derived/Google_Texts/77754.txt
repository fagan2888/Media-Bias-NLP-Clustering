Border Patrol and the Pima County Sheriff's Department are investigating after a pursuit that ended with a crash and a suspected smuggler in custody.

Agents followed a truck heading West on Interstate 10 that was suspected of carrying drugs, according to Deputy Tom Peine with PCSD. He said the driver pulled into Littletown Park near Valencia and Craycroft. That's when, Peine said, the driver attempted to go between a row of yellow pylons but crashed soon after. The pylons were connected by cables and the truck had ripped out close to a dozen of them.

Agents arrested the suspect without injury and seized several hundred pounds of marijuana, according to Peine.

The driver was alone in the vehicle, according to Peine.
