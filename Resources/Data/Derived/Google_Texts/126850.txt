Joni Eareckson Tada, an evangelical Christian author, radio host, and international advocate for people with disabilities, has revealed that she endorsed Senator Marco Rubio for president because of his commitment to caring for society's weakest members.



"What Senator Rubio has done thus far in the Senate to help dismantle Obamacare is pretty important, because the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, is not good news for the elderly, the medically fragile, infants with disabilities, or people like me with significantly handicapping conditions," she told The Gospel Herald during a sit down interview in Nashville, Tennessee.



She added, "When there are only a limited number of healthcare dollars, people with significant disabilities and the elderly aren't going to have the same access to good healthcare as those that are healthy and able-bodied. I'm so grateful that Senator Rubio recognizes this, he sees this, he sees the danger of the affordable care act, and he has moved in the Senate to help begin dismantling it, and that's that good news."
