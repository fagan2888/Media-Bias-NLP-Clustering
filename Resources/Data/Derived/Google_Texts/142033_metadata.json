Main Street.\n\nHara owes a debt of gratitude to that culture, which inspired him in February to begin drawing comics on Starbucks cups, with a goal of completing 100 \u201cpanels\u201d by year\u2019s end.\n\nHe completed the effort December 31, posting a photo of his 100th comic on Instagram.\n\nThe self-deprecating sketch shows Hara toasting the milestone from an armchair (\u201cHoney! Kids! I did it!\u201d) to an otherwise-empty room (\u201cHoney? Kids?\u201d)\n\nYet the project, connected online via the hashtag #100CoffeeCups, has drawn widespread attention and renewed his hope of a career in professional cartooning.\n\nPart of the appeal of the drawings, he suspects, lies in his atypical canvas.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s this thing they have held in their hand and thrown in the garbage that has now been transformed into this funny thought,\u201d Hara said recently at the Starbucks - where else? - next to Resource/Ammirati, the Arena District marketing company where he works as a creative director.\n\n\u201cIt differentiates just enough to really step outside of what people are used to seeing a cartoon on.\u201d\n\nHis profile is rising: His Instagram feed, where photos of the cups are shared, has rocketed to 63,800 followers - up from 8,000 at the start of the project.\n\nHis work has been described as \u201cbrew-tiful,\u201d with \u201cextra-strong shots of joy,\u201d by the viral gatekeepers of BuzzFeed.\n\nStories about the artist have run in outlets ranging from Playboy magazine to The Telegraph of London.\n\nAnd he has signed with a literary agent to shop a proposal for a book based on the creations.\n\nThe attention seems unusual for a soft-spoken guy who, until last year, had set aside aspirations of professional cartooning to focus on his family and day job.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always made more practical choices with my career,\u201d said Hara, who earned an illustration degree from the Columbus College of Art & Design and spent years as a corporate graphic artist - and, since 2012, has filled the role of a wordsmith handling social-media campaigns for big brands.\n\n\u201cI was really trying to get to a world where I was drawing cartoons again.\u201d\n\nThe concept of #100CoffeeCups jelled early last year during a family trip to Florida.\n\nThe designs kept brewing at a pace of two to three a week.\n\nEach one, he said, takes about two hours from start to finish.\n\nAlthough his Instagram portfolio has picked up tens of thousands of \u201clikes,\u201d the digital acclaim didn\u2019t happen overnight.\n\nHara had developed a Twitter fan base at a steady drip for several years, attracting 68,000 people - including A-list comedians Andy Richter and Sarah Silverman - to his acerbic musings on pop culture (\u201cThe Walking Dead is like one very long infomercial for CrossFit\u201d) and parenthood (\u201cMy kids are really into magic right now, which should delay the sex talk by at least a few decades\u201d).\n\nIn March 2013, Time magazine named his account (@yoyoha) as one of the 140 best Twitter feeds - a list that also featured those of Chelsea Clinton, Bill Gates and the Guggenheim Museum in New York.\n\nHe deserves the attention, said Halle Hara, who has known her husband of 11 years since childhood - a time when Josh kept his sketchbooks (and an insect character, Mr. Bug) close at hand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something he\u2019s worked at his entire life,\u201d said the 41-year-old judicial law clerk and the mother of their two sons, 7 and 9.\n\n\u201cFor him to have this audience, that\u2019s the main thing that brings me joy.\u201d\n\nHumor served as a cornerstone of his upbringing, said brother Jesse Hara, a 39-year-old Los Angeles producer whose comedy pilot Wrecked was bought in the fall by TBS.\n\n\u201cIf you could make someone laugh in our house,\u201d the younger Hara said, \u201cthat was one of the highest achievements.\u201d\n\nMark Hillman - a Resource/Ammirati executive creative director who, based on impressions of Hara\u2019s personal Twitter feed, hired him two years ago - isn\u2019t surprised by the reach of his influence.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s constantly got this very funny, somewhat-slanted look on life that\u2019s also very endearing and sweet and menschy,\u201d Hillman said. \u201cThose tend to be the best types of advertising writers \u2026 and the best cartoonists.\u201d\n\nHara draws a parallel between work and play.\n\nWhether he is illustrating cups or writing tweets for a brand, he said, \u201cIf \u2026 (users) are going to invite you into their timeline, you have to give them something they don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nAs such, he plans to continue beyond the 100th cup.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Columbus Dispatch, http://www.dispatch.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Judged by his creations, the Bexley artist behind the wry Sharpie doodles on Starbucks cups is a canine-smitten, celebrity-riffing humorist with a soft spot for junk food and an insatiable lust for caffeine.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Judged by his creations, the Bexley artist behind the wry Sharpie doodles on Starbucks cups is a canine-smitten, celebrity-riffing humorist with a soft spot for junk food and an insatiable lust for caffeine.", "title": "Coffee-cup drawings garner acclaim for Ohio artist", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/18/coffee-cup-drawings-garner-acclaim-for-ohio-artist/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/18/0122329dea729e026b0f6a70670034ca.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/18/0122329dea729e026b0f6a70670034ca.jpg", "description": "Judged by his creations, the Bexley artist behind the wry Sharpie doodles on Starbucks cups is a canine-smitten, celebrity-riffing humorist with a soft spot for junk food and an insatiable lust for ca", "card": "summary", "title": "Coffee-cup drawings garner acclaim for Ohio artist"}, "Author": "KEVIN JOY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -
