It's called Imagin8, and includes art work from 45 girls ages 8 to 17.\n\nLauryn McConnell is ten and this is her second year; she's already sold one of her paintings.\n\nEach girl has a micro savings account, so she'll get to keep 30 percent from the sale. She can use that money for educational materials or field trips.\n\nShe sold her abstract, different shapes and bright colors. The buyer asked how she thought he ought to display it.\n\n\"I would like it sideways,\" McConnell said.\n\nThis is the seventh year of the Tulsa Girls Art School, so some of the older students have been involved since the beginning, and you can see what they've accomplished.\n\nTulsa artist Matt Moffett is the executive director of the school and said the idea is to allow the kids to develop as young artists.\n\n\"How far can a kid go if they have all the tools they need,\" Moffett said.\n\nThat's the concept, give these young people professional instruction and the supplies they need, and see where it leads.\n\n\"I think these girls are dreamers. I want them to be better and bigger dreamers,\" said Moffett.\n\nThe showing at the Zarrow Center is free and open through most of February.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The Tulsa Girls Art School is a non-profit after-school art program that trains some Tulsa Public School students to be visual artists.", "author": "Rick Wells", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/24583747/tulsa-girls-art-school-students-showcase-work-in-brady-district", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24583747_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Tulsa Girls Art School is a non-profit after-school art program that trains some Tulsa Public School students to be visual artists.", "title": "Tulsa Girls Art School Students Showcase Work In Brady District"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24583747_SA.jpg", "description": "The Tulsa Girls Art School is a non-profit after-school art program that trains some Tulsa Public School students to be visual artists.", "card": "summary", "title": "Tulsa Girls Art School Students Showcase Work In Brady District"}, "wnreadableurl": "tulsa-girls-art-school-students-showcase-work-in-brady-district", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2014/01/29", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS28", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3381\"", "article_summary": "The Tulsa Girls Art School is a non-profit after-school art program that trains some Tulsa Public School students to be visual artists.\nMelissa Garcia is nine years old and brand new to the Tulsa Girls Art School, and very proud of the work she's already done.\nThis is the Girls Art School winter show.\nThis is the seventh year of the Tulsa Girls Art School, so some of the older students have been involved since the beginning, and you can see what they've accomplished.\nThe young artists got to display their work at the Zarrow Center in the Brady District."}
