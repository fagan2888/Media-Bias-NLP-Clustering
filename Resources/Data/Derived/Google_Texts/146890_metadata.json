Keck tried to take evasive action, but was not able to avoid the Monte Carlo and the two collided head-on.\n\nKeck's vehicle departed the roadway to the left and came to rest on the west side of the highway. Baldwin's vehicle stayed on the highway.\n\nBaldwin was pinned inside his vehicle for approximately two hours before being freed by the Fairview Fire Department using the Jaws of Life. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Keck was not injured.\n\nTroopers say Keck was wearing his seatbelt and Baldwin was not.
