He argued that the GOP\u2019s only plan is to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\n\u201cBecause Harry Reid has hid it on his desk, that\u2019s why,\u201d Loesch replied. \u201cYou know that there are over at least nine plans that have been submitted by House Republicans and sent to the Senate \u2014 alternatives to Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThe host and guest started to clash when the reality of Americans losing health insurance plans under Obamacare became the topic of conversation. Schultz claimed only \u201cjunk\u201d plans were dropped because they no longer complied with federal standards, but Loesch disagreed.\n\n\u201cRemember, it was Politifact\u2019s \u2018Lie of the Year\u2019 just recently that the president promised that if you like your health care plan you can keep it,\u201d Loesch said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the question!\u201d Schultz yelled as he and Loesch talked over each other. \u201cI want you to tell my audience \u2014 Dana, I\u2019m not gonna do this.\u201d\n\nWhen Schultz told Loesch that he was showing her \u201crespect by doing the interview,\u201d she snarked back, \u201cI\u2019m doing you a favor by doing this interview.\u201d\n\nPlenty of heated crosstalk continued, with Schultz telling Loesch at one point that she was being \u201crude\u201d and \u201cunworkable.\u201d\n\nEventually, Schultz allotted Loesch 30 seconds to make her point.\n\n\u201cDo I believe that health insurance needed to be reformed? Absolutely,\u201d Loesch said. \u201cWe could\u2019ve increased portability, we could have decoupled business from people\u2019s health insurance so that they could always maintain their health insurance.\u201d\n\nShe also said there should be increased competition in the health care industry, which she argued would result in more choices for the American people.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, there are 25 percent\u2026 more competition in the market today offering plans. So that\u2019s been taken care of in that regard,\u201d Schultz shot back.\n\n\u201cNo, having the federal government do it isn\u2019t competition,\u201d Loesch interrupted.\n\nThe MSNBC host\u2019s \u201cwe had an election\u201d line also slightly backfired as TheBlaze personality reminded him, \u201cYeah, and we had another one and we have a Republican Congress.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the interview, Loesch revealed that she has a friend who is battling cancer and claimed the person has lost treatment options due to Obamacare regulations. Schultz immediately grew angry, proclaiming that he didn\u2019t believe her and asked if he could interview the friend.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty more to the interview.
