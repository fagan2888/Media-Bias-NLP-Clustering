REUTERS/Jim Bourg (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS HEALTH) - RTX152H6\n\n3966051\n\nNew questions are being raised about the tax-exempt status of an Obamacare enrollment group tied to Kathleen Sebelius after it was implicated in James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s most recent investigative probe.\n\nO\u2019Keefe captured an official for Enroll America, for which Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary Kathleen Sebelius admitted to fundraising, being introduced at an event as \u201cthe official group for the DNC.\u201d O\u2019Keefe\u2019s work also revealed that Enroll America might be working with the political action committee Battleground Texas, possibly sharing mined data between the two groups.\n\nO\u2019Keefe\u2019s footage was enough to prompt the legal advocacy group Cause of Action to write a letter to the attorney general of the state of Texas asking for an inquiry into Enroll America\u2019s tax-exempt status.\n\n\u201cThere may be violations of Texas law as well, including but not limited to: the state False Claims Act; conspiracy to commit Medicaid fraud; and consumer fraud,\u201d according to the letter.\n\n\u201cYou may wish to evaluate whether entities such as Enroll America and Battleground Texas are adhering to both state and federal law regarding 501(c)(3) nonprofits and 527 political action committees. Any violations of the Internal Revenue Code may be referred to the Department of Justice or the Internal Revenue Service. Moreover, Texas has the oversight capability to ensure that federal funds are used in a transparent, accountable, and legally compliant manner,\u201d according to the letter.\n\n\u201cYou must promptly refer to the HHS Office of Inspector General any credible evidence that a principal, employee, agent, contractor, subrecipient, subcontractor, or other person or entity has submitted a false claim under the False Claims Act, or has committed a criminal or civil violation pertaining to fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, gratuity, or similar misconduct involving those funds,\u201d according to the letter.\n\nSebelius\u2019 relationship with Enroll America is the subject of a pending government ethics audit.\n\nSebelius admitted in testimony before a House ethics panel in June that she personally asked the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and H&R Block to contribute to Enroll America. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation owns more than $1 billion across 13 million shares of stock in Johnson & Johnson, which is regulated by HHS.\n\nThe HHS inspector general even subpoenaed Johnson and Johnson in August for information about its promotional efforts for a pain medication.\n\nSebelius also admitted that she called the health insurers Kaiser Permanente, Ascension Health, and Johnson and Johnson \u2014 all of which are regulated by HHS \u2014 to discuss Enroll America, but without soliciting donations in those calls. Sebelius bestowed a 2012 award on Kaiser Permanente Colorado, vowing that Kaiser \u201cwill be serving as a role model for the rest of the country.\u201d\n\nThe Government Accountability Office\u2019s (GAO) open audit of Sebelius\u2019 communications on behalf of Enroll America is still pending, though a GAO spokesman declined to provide details to The Daily Caller about the status of the audit.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Patrick Howley", "description": "New questions are being raised about the tax-exempt status of an Obamacare enrollment group tied to Kathleen Sebelius", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "New questions are being raised about the tax-exempt status of an Obamacare enrollment group tied to Kathleen Sebelius after it was implicated in James O'Keefe's most recent investigative probe.
