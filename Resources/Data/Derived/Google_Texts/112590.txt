A new report says Florida ranks second only to California in the number of homes at risk for a natural disaster.

The research firm, RealtyTrac, said in a report released last week that Florida had 6.7 million homes in counties with high risk or very high risk of a natural disaster.

At the metro level, Miami ranked third, only behind New York and Los Angeles.

RealtyTrac says the threat in Florida comes primarily from hurricanes.
