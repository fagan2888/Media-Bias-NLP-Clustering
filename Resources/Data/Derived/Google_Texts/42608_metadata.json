The personal trainer and gym owner had 28 monthly clients on the roster \u2014 enough to survive day to day, but not enough to sustain his 2,500-square-foot Riverside Drive facility over the long haul.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m passionate about fitness, not about business,\u201d says Wimsett, who enjoys working one-on-one with clients and developing individualized plans for them.\n\nBut that approach made Mountain BizWorks a natural fit for Wimsett. After assessing his 6-year-old business\u2019 strengths and weaknesses, Wimsett\u2019s coach at the nonprofit helped him create a plan for rebranding his services.\n\nIn January, Wimsett rolled out his new business name \u2014 Inspire Personal Fitness \u2014 along with a new logo and website. He\u2019s now up to 75 clients, and he\u2019s back at Mountain BizWorks for more coaching, this time to figure out how to manage his recent growth.\n\n\u201cKeith is very eager to learn,\u201d says Barry Gupton, Wimsett\u2019s current coach. The business finance specialist works with 15 to 20 clients at a time, giving them the tools and support needed to create sustainable enterprises.\n\nThe nonprofit\u2019s client list includes such iconic Asheville brands as LaZoom Tours, The Organic Mechanic, FLS Energy and French Broad Chocolates, among many others. But in the fall of 2013, Wimsett didn\u2019t know if Mountain BizWorks would be around long enough to help him take his business to the next level.\n\nA painful restructuring\n\nThat year, a sudden funding crisis threw the long-running nonprofit into a tailspin. An expected grant failed to come through, and just like that, the organization found itself struggling to survive. CEO Shaw Canale resigned, half the staff were laid off, programs were cut and, in July of 2014, Patrick Fitzsimmons took over as Mountain BizWorks\u2019 executive director.\n\nA former regional director for the American Red Cross, Fitzsimmons was no stranger to disaster, but what he confronted now was different from a flood or fire; he led an additional belt-tightening effort that he calls \u201cso painful.\u201d\n\nLongtime board member Bill Carrington, who works as a regional director at the Self-Help Credit Union, says the months following that restructuring were hard. \u201cMany board members went way above and beyond what would usually be expected\u201d to help the organization hang on, recalls Carrington, who took over as board chair in June.\n\nPatrick Fitzsimmons has been executive director of Mountain BizWorks since July 2014.

The real root of the crisis was an over-reliance on grant funding, notes retired financial professional Fred Waldkoetter, who joined the board in June of 2014 to help with the restructuring. In the nonprofit world, he explains, self-sufficiency refers to the amount of revenue derived from earned income \u2014 in this case, the interest and fees from the loans Mountain BizWorks makes. At the time of the crisis, the organization was relying on grants for almost 80 percent of its revenue.\n\nOne of the casualties of the restructuring was the popular Foundations business planning course. Rather than shut it down entirely, however, Mountain BizWorks contracted with former staffer Annie Price\u2019s firm, Birds Eye Business Planning & Consulting, to revamp and run the program. Price zeroed in on the most critical topics for new business owners, shortening the course from eight weekly sessions to six.\n\nDemand for the classes, held at Mountain BizWorks\u2019 South Lexington Avenue offices, has been strong. With 15 participants, the current session is at capacity; two concurrent sessions are planned for this fall.\n\nThe secret sauce\n\nHaving handed off its flagship group education component, Mountain BizWorks now focuses on two key areas: coaching and lending.\n\nFitzsimmons calls coaching the \u201csecret sauce\u201d his organization uses to help create jobs and economic opportunity. Coaches get to know clients and their businesses well, so when one of them applies for a loan, the nonprofit is well positioned to gauge both their readiness and the appropriate amount of funding.\n\n\u201cWe provide a level of hand-holding that larger banks aren\u2019t set up to offer,\u201d notes Fitzsimmons, who credits that kind of personalized guidance with limiting the institution\u2019s 2014 loan loss rate to just 1 percent (2.2 percent over the last three years).\n\nCoaching is free for clients who meet certain criteria; others pay a fee based on their business\u2019 size. Eric Seiler, a Rolfing and yoga therapist, says the fees are \u201cvery affordable\u201d for a small business. He chose coach Bob Perlstein from Mountain BizWorks\u2019 list of two dozen specialists, all of whom are entrepreneurs themselves.\n\nLoans, meanwhile, provide capital to people seeking to start or expand a small business. The money comes from various sources: the U.S. Small Business Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural Development program, foundation grants, donations, local investors and returns on its existing loan portfolio.\n\n\u201cWe live by our funding,\u201d says Carrington. Accordingly, the nonprofit is trying to diversify its sources. \u201cWe\u2019re getting better, but we\u2019re not out of the woods yet,\u201d he reports. Applying for grants is a complex process, and funders\u2019 decision-making criteria can be opaque, notes Carrington, adding that it\u2019s still not clear precisely why the organization failed to secure the grant that triggered the 2013 crisis.\n\nSo far this year, Mountain BizWorks has lent local entrepreneurs $1 million in Small Business Administration funds. In April, the SBA approved an additional $1.25 million allotment, and the nonprofit is waiting on Congress to release that money.\n\nMeanwhile, Mountain BizWorks receives about three dozen loan inquiries per month, Fitzsimmons reports. This spring was especially busy, with 54 inquiries in April and 50 more in May. The nonprofit generally makes about 10 loans per month.\n\nBusinesses turned down for loans may be offered coaching or steered toward group education. \u201c\u2018No\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean \u2018never,\u2019\u201d says Fitzsimmons; some businesses aren\u2019t ready yet, but his organization can help them address what\u2019s lacking to improve their chances of accessing capital.\n\nNew blood\n\nAs Mountain BizWorks celebrates its 25th year of creating economic opportunity in the region, AdvantageWest, a state-funded economic development entity, is winding down after a 21-year run. The latter organization \u201creceived 60 to 80 percent of its operating funds from the state of North Carolina,\u201d explains Matt Raker, the agency\u2019s former vice president of entrepreneurship. When those funds were cut off, he says, AdvantageWest had no choice but to close.\n\nIn July, Raker joined Mountain BizWorks as director of community investments. He brought with him two programs in need of a new home: the Advantage Opportunity Fund and ScaleUp WNC.\n\nMountain BizWorks was already servicing loans and supplying administrative support for the Advantage Opportunity Fund, making the transition seamless, says Raker. The fund offers startup or early stage capital to companies that have the potential for rapid growth and job creation, particularly those in rural counties.\n\nNow completing its first year, ScaleUp WNC is funded by a five-year, $1.2 million SBA grant \u2014 one of only eight such awards nationwide. Each year, ScaleUp will provide instruction, mentoring and support for 30 small businesses.\n\nThose clients, notes Raker, \u201cneed a focused, quick, intensive program they can access while continuing to run their businesses.\u201d\n\nParticipants attend eight classes, prepare a strategic business plan and receive individual mentoring. The program culminates in a multimedia presentation showcasing each business to a community audience. The most recent presentations were held at The Orange Peel on May 26.\n\nRaker sees tremendous need to continue these programs. \u201cOver the last several years, there\u2019s been less and less capital available for small businesses,\u201d he points out.\n\nFitzsimmons, meanwhile, says the programs Raker brought with him are a great fit with Mountain BizWorks\u2019 mission and focus. Like the nonprofit\u2019s other programs, he continues, these latest additions receive no state funding. And in light of what happened to AdvantageWest, Fitzsimmons considers that \u201ca very good thing.\u201d\n\nMatt Raker joined Mountain BizWorks in July, bringing with him two programs from AdvantageWest.

The new program uses a curriculum developed by the credit union specifically for owners of child care businesses. Jane Hatley, a regional director at Self-Help, trained six Mountain BizWorks coaches in the curriculum.\n\n\u201cThis course is part of a holistic effort to bring more attention to the importance of a strong child care network as a driver of economic growth,\u201d Ford explains. \u201cBusinesses benefit when their employees have access to high-quality, affordable child care.\u201d\n\nWanda Winslow has operated Wanda\u2019s Childcare Home in Kenilworth for 15 years; she\u2019s taking the course to stay current. \u201cIn this fast-paced world, everything seems to be changing,\u201d she says. \u201cI need to know about things like the Affordable Care Act and how to market my business on the Internet.\u201d\n\nWinslow, whose business is licensed to care for five infants or toddlers and three school-aged children, says she has little opportunity to network with other care providers. Her facility is open 50 hours a week, and she has no assistant. \u201cI\u2019m out here on my own, so it\u2019s good to hear what others are doing,\u201d she says.\n\nThe eight half-day Saturday sessions are being held at Mountain BizWorks, and two participants haven\u2019t launched their businesses yet. \u201cIf a new child care business can make it for three years,\u201d says Winslow, \u201cthen they can keep it going.\u201d In the past, she received counseling through the SCORE program \u2014 an advantage many care providers haven\u2019t had.\n\nFord, meanwhile, says the new course will cover a range of business topics while connecting participants with coaches who can provide ongoing mentoring and training.\n\nFor her part, Winslow says she loves her line of work, despite the challenges and isolation. \u201cIt\u2019s truly amazing to do this. If a child feels really loved in those early years, it lays the foundation for success later on.\u201d\n\nFord couldn\u2019t agree more. \u201cThe first 2,000 days of human life are critical,\u201d she notes. \u201cSupporting child care providers with business training and counseling is an investment that will pay dividends throughout the community.\u201d\n\nKeeping it local\n\nFitzsimmons believes Asheville\u2019s entrepreneurial businesses are the bedrock of the city\u2019s unique character. \u201cWe are not like every other town in America,\u201d he says, and Mountain BizWorks has been an important force in supporting the businesses that have shaped this city\u2019s identity. In last year\u2019s Mountain Xpress Best of WNC readers\u2019 poll, he points out, 83 of the winners were Mountain BizWorks alumni. In 2013, 93 were current or former Mountain BizWorks clients.\n\nLast year, the nonprofit originated 61 new loans totaling $1.1 million. At the end of 2014, its portfolio comprised 166 loans with a combined value of $3.3 million. The interest and fees on those loans provided 47 percent of the organization\u2019s operating revenue, with federal, state and city grants, plus foundation and individual support, making up the rest.\n\nThe bottom line? Mountain BizWorks ended 2014 in the black, with a net income of $109,309. But that\u2019s only the beginning, says Fitzsimmons: 320 existing jobs were retained and 142 new ones created; 96 businesses were sustained, while 45 new ones came into being as a result of Mountain BizWorks programs; and 312 clients received business coaching.\n\nMeanwhile, the nonprofit\u2019s individual investor program offers community members a way to support local businesses. The risk is low, because the investors contribute to Mountain BizWorks\u2019 total loan portfolio, rather than funding a particular business. Participants choose a fixed, below-market interest rate and term for their investment, and many decline to take even the maximum available return, notes Raker, so that more of their money can help loan recipients.\n\nPart of Raker\u2019s job is developing new ways to attract community investors. One possibility, he says, would be putting together funds that focused on a particular business sector, such as food or tourism, instead of simply having investors support the overall portfolio.\n\nBrighter days ahead\n\nThroughout its ups and downs, Mountain BizWorks has been a source of support for local businesses that no other lender would touch, says Fitzsimmons.\n\nEven during the crisis, remembers Wimsett, the organization reassured clients that it would be around for the long haul.\n\nBut though both staff and board aim to ensure a sustainable future for the organization, the perpetual uncertainty concerning funding makes that \u201ca lofty goal,\u201d says Carrington.\n\nIf the future is always somewhat dicey, however, he believes the organization now has the staff it needs to do the job. The current team, notes Carrington, \u201chas expanded our knowledge of grant sources and sharpened our skills for applying. We\u2019ve also gone back to some funders that passed us over a year or two ago; they\u2019ve been open to receiving new grant applications from us.\u201d\n\nAnd in the meantime, he continues, \u201cThe proof is in the numbers, and they get better every month.\u201d\n\nWaldkoetter, who now works pro bono as the organization\u2019s chief financial officer, agrees. These days, he says, \u201cWe are much less reliant on grant funding for our liquidity. From that standpoint, we\u2019re a much stronger organization.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "That year, a sudden funding crisis threw the long-running nonprofit Mountain BizWorks into a tailspin.
