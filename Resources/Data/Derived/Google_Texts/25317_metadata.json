This version has been updated.\n\nVirginia Gov.-elect Terry McAuliffe gestures along with his wife, Dorothy, during a news conference to announce his transition team at the Capitol in Richmond on Nov. 6. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nVirginia\u2019s top corporate executives, including many who have backed Republicans before, are betting that Gov.-elect Terry McAuliffe (D) will be good for business. Top union leaders think he\u2019s their man, too.\n\nCan McAuliffe satisfy both?\n\nWhile unions were pouring money and muscle into electing McAuliffe, he was busy promising to uphold the state\u2019s anti-union \u201cright-to-work\u201d law and winning endorsements from business groups. As a result, both big business and big labor consider McAuliffe an ally, each convinced that he could not have won without its support.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic Terry McAuliffe will be a pro-business governor,\u201d said Barry DuVal, president and chief executive of the Virginia Chamber of Commerce, which has a membership of about 13,500 businesses.\n\n\u201cWe feel good with him right now,\u201d said Tim Waters, national political director for the Pittsburgh-based United Steelworkers, whose 27,000 Virginia members toil in shipyards, tire factories, paper mills and other industrial sites. \u201cBut we\u2019re cautious in our optimism.\u201d\n\nAlthough corporate executives and union leaders express confidence that McAuliffe can somehow be both pro-business and pro-labor, there are signs that McAuliffe is still trying to find the right balance after running as a liberal Democrat on some issues and promising to govern as a centrist on others.\n\nLately, McAuliffe has found himself in a somewhat similar situation on the abortion issue. He campaigned hard as a defender of abortion rights but then angered women\u2019s groups when reports surfaced that he was courting Republican Gov. Robert F. McDonnell\u2019s health and human resources secretary, Bill Hazel, to stay on despite Hazel\u2019s apparent support for tough new regulations on abortion clinics.\n\nAfter contributing nearly $3 million and mustering an army of union members to work the streets, labor leaders believe they have done more than put a friend in the Executive Mansion.\n\nBesides pushing to expand Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, McAuliffe is expected to use executive appointments and regulatory policy to alter the balance between business and labor, union leaders said. Others want McAuliffe to prevent any tinkering with state employees\u2019 retirement benefits, such as attempts by Republicans to shift from a traditional defined-benefit pension plan to a 401(k)-style defined-contribution plan or a hybrid approach.\n\nAbove all, union leaders said organized labor strongly backed McAuliffe to send a message beyond Virginia.\n\n\u201cWe looked at this as a watershed,\u201d said Harold Schaitberger, general president of the D.C.-based International Association of Fire Fighters, which gave $325,000 to McAuliffe and other Virginia Democrats. \u201cIf we\u2019re able to elect a business-friendly progressive in the commonwealth of Virginia, then you could see this as a measurable moment and maybe a reflection or a harbinger of where we see ourselves going in 2014, when we have 36 gubernatorial races.\u201d\n\nThe United Steelworkers\u2019 Waters said: \u201cWe really saw Virginia as the first shot in that battle.\u201d\n\nEven if McAuliffe falls short of labor\u2019s hopes, union officials said, he cannot be worse than the Republican candidate he defeated, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II. Cuccinelli and other Republican heroes of the tea party have spent much of their careers demonizing the labor movement, union officials said. McAuliffe, in contrast, has offered them his cellphone number.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a long, long working relationship with Terry,\u201d said John Niemiec, president of the IAFF-\n\naffiliated Fairfax County Professional Firefighters and Paramedics. \u201cIt\u2019s just a very simple expectation: to have a seat at the table. And Terry has said over and over again that the firefighter will have a seat at the table. In a right-to-work state, that is huge.\u201d\n\nDuring the campaign, McAuliffe chose his words carefully when discussing organized labor. Touring a Metro station under construction in McLean, McAuliffe declined to say whether he would defend Virginia\u2019s right-to-work law, which bans compulsory union membership as a condition of employment. He also skated past a question about whether he would support union-friendly project labor agreements that require contractors on public projects to negotiate wages and workplace rules.\n\nLater, McAuliffe made clear that the state\u2019s right-to-work law is here to stay. The Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce\u2019s political arm, when endorsing McAuliffe, took pains to say that he had expressed opposition to mandatory project labor agreements and had \u201cvowed to veto any attempt to chip away at Virginia\u2019s long-standing right-to-work laws.\u201d\n\nBut McAuliffe called union heads before the endorsement became public to reassure them that whatever the chamber might say, he would be their ally, Waters said.\n\n\u201cThe chamber \u2014 especially local chambers \u2014 can be aggressive and oftentimes want to push a candidate to try to say what they want him to say. And they want to hear what they want to hear,\u201d Waters said. \u201cI think they\u2019re the ones who should be concerned about Terry McAuliffe.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe has a tangled and sometimes controversial history with unions. In the 1990s, he partnered with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers\u2019s pension fund on a Florida real estate deal in which the union fund put up nearly all the money but gave McAuliffe a 50-percent share. The U.S. Labor Department deemed the deal a sketchy investment for the union and took legal action, eventually reaching a settlement.\n\nAlso in the 1990s, McAuliffe was questioned by federal investigators in a Teamsters money-laundering case that led to criminal convictions of several people. A Democratic National Committee official testified at the time that McAuliffe was behind a scheme to have Democratic contributors illegally raise money for then-Teamsters President Ron Carey\u2019s reelection campaign in exchange for union contributions to the Democrats. McAuliffe denied wrongdoing and was not charged.\n\nBut that history is one reason Cuccinelli argued repeatedly on the campaign trail that McAuliffe would do the unions\u2019 bidding if he won. \u201cI think our small-business owners are really concerned,\u201d said Nicole Riley, state director of the National Federation of Independent Business.\n\nEven union leaders say McAuliffe is unlikely to make a dent in Virginia\u2019s right-to-work tradition as long as the House of Delegates remains in GOP hands. They say McAuliffe won labor\u2019s vote for other reasons, particularly because he vigorously supports a Medicaid expansion as part of the state\u2019s response to the federal health-care overhaul. Cuccinelli, in contrast, opposes it.\n\n\u201cA majority of folks who will get access to health care are the working poor\u201d if Medicaid is expanded in Virginia, said David Broder, president of a Service Employees International Union local, Virginia 512, which represents about 2,600 workers, including county employees in Fairfax and Loudoun counties and home-health-care providers statewide.\n\nUnion leaders also hope McAuliffe\u2019s administration will simply be more accessible to labor, perhaps by following a labor-relations practice referred to as \u201cmeet and confer.\u201d In Fairfax and right-to-work states including North Carolina, government officials regularly confer with unions about workplace issues. But any agreements are not binding.\n\n\u201cRight-to-work in this state is firmly entrenched,\u201d said Karen Conchar, secretary-treasurer of SEIU Virginia 512 and former head of the local\u2019s Fairfax County unit. \u201cAt this point in the state, we\u2019d be happy to get meet and confer.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Organiized labor put $3 million into helping McAuliffe defeat Cuccinelli; now unions hope for gains", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/freddy.kunkle", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Organiized labor put $3 million into helping McAuliffe defeat Cuccinelli; now unions hope for gains", "title": "Labor and business both invested in McAuliffe victory", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/gov-elect-terry-mcauliffe-courted-va-labor-and-business-can-he-keep-both-sides-happy/2013/11/16/e74654fa-4d55-11e3-ac54-aa84301ced81_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/11/17/Local-Politics/Images/Virginia_Governor_McAuliffe-0e9d9-535.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@KunkleFredrick"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "va gubernatorial race va goveror's race va goverors race ken cuccinelli Kenneth cuccinelli terry mcauliffe virginia governor race virginia governor\u2019s race va governor\u2019s race va gubernatorial contest virginia politics va politics transition unions SEIU Service Employees International Union unions United Steelworkers Union USW", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/freddy.kunkle"}, "news_keywords": "va gubernatorial race va goveror's race va goverors race ken cuccinelli Kenneth cuccinelli terry mcauliffe virginia governor race virginia governor\u2019s race va governor\u2019s race va gubernatorial contest virginia politics va politics transition unions SEIU Service Employees International Union unions United Steelworkers Union USW", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "e74654fa-4d55-11e3-ac54-aa84301ced81"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde9e1\"", "article_summary": "(Steve Helber/AP)Virginia\u2019s top corporate executives, including many who have backed Republicans before, are betting that Gov.-elect Terry McAuliffe (D) will be good for business.\nVirginia Gov.-elect Terry McAuliffe gestures along with his wife, Dorothy, during a news conference to announce his transition team at the Capitol in Richmond on Nov. 6.\nIn a right-to-work state, that is huge.\u201dDuring the campaign, McAuliffe chose his words carefully when discussing organized labor.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Governor-elect Terry McAuliffe had asked Virginia Secretary of Health and Human Resources Bill Hazel to stay on.\nEven union leaders say McAuliffe is unlikely to make a dent in Virginia\u2019s right-to-work tradition as long as the House of Delegates remains in GOP hands."}
