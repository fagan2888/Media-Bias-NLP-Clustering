The Cadillac tax, which is due to take effect in 2018, is a 40 percent excise tax on high-cost employer health benefits. It was the part of the Affordable Care Act that labor union leaders most objected to when the bill was making its way through Congress in 2010, and they\u2019ve have been calling for its repeal ever since.\n\nThe tax was sold as a way to put a lid on premium increases \u2014 and cap what is now an open-ended tax subsidy for employer-paid health coverage.\n\nHere\u2019s why it makes sense \u2026 in theory. What an employer pays for employee health benefits isn\u2019t taxed. If that money went instead to wages or profits, it would be subject to income and payroll taxes. So there\u2019s a cost to the U.S. Treasury for every dollar employers spend on employee health benefits. But if the federal government levies a punitive tax on every dollar they spend on health benefits above a certain limit, employers would find a way to keep health benefit spending below that limit. According to the theory, that can be done without hurting workers, since the reason premiums are so high is that benefits are too generous. Workers pay too little for their healthcare, the theory goes, and that causes them to use unnecessary medical services. It\u2019s an argument that appeals to health policy wonks \u2026 and Ivy League-trained economists working for the White House.\n\nOut in the real world, workers with employer-provided coverage are already paying higher deductibles and copays than ever. Deductibles have gone up by about $100 a year since Obamacare passed in 2010. And any employer spending heavily on health benefits has already tried to put a lid on costs.\n\nObamacare\u2019s Cadillac tax will start on any employer health expenditures above $10,200 a year for single coverage and $27,000 for family coverage. Those amounts include the total insurance premium, regardless of who pays it, plus any employer contribution to a Health Savings Account.\n\nThe Cadillac tax may in fact stop employers from spending above those limits, but employers will accomplish that by shifting the burden to workers. The number one way employers can reduce premiums is by increasing deductibles, co-pays and coinsurance paid by workers.\n\nUnion employers can\u2019t wait until 2018 to worry about it. They pay for health benefits under multi-year union contracts that are already being negotiated. How to avoid the Cadillac tax was a big factor in the tough bargaining that nearly led to an ILWU West Coast port shutdown. In Longview, Washington, 800 paper mill workers struck for 12 days last month after their employer, Kapstone, imposed health benefit cuts in the name of avoiding the tax.\n\nEconomic theory implies that the money employers save on health benefit costs as a result of the tax will be passed through to workers as higher wages.\u201d \u2014 Jason Furman, Obama\u2019s top economic adviser\n\nBut the Obama Administration appears to be standing firm in defense of the Cadillac tax. Jason Furman, Chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, defended the Cadillac tax in an Oct. 7 speech at the Brookings Institution think tank, saying it will not only reduce health care costs and lower future federal deficits, but even boost workers\u2019 wages and lead to more jobs.\n\n\u201cEconomic theory implies that the money employers save on health benefit costs as a result of the tax will be passed through to workers as higher wages in the long run,\u201d said Furman \u2014 a Harvard-educated multi-millionaire and son of a wealthy New York real estate investor. Of course, economic theory also predicts higher wages as unemployment drops, and that\u2019s not happening either.\n\nKaiser Family Foundation CEO Drew Altman, in an Oct. 2 Wall Street Journal op-ed, predicts that the Cadillac tax will hit low-income workers and the chronically ill hardest \u2014 because it will cause employers to increase deductibles and co-pays. And actuaries from the consulting firm Milliman project that the tax will unfairly impact employers that happen to have lots of older workers, or that are located in the areas with the highest-price health care, like the Northeastern United States. One recent Milliman study reported that nearly 70 percent of variance in health insurance premiums is explained by geographic location, while just 6 percent is due to the comprehensiveness of the benefits.\n\nBut AFL-CIO legislative representative Tom Leibfried points to signs that the Cadillac tax is losing support. Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are in favor of repeal. So is newly installed Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. And at least three pending bills in Congress would repeal it. A bill sponsored by Connecticut Democrat Joe Courtney, has 167 co-sponsors, including 20 Republicans [In Oregon, Peter DeFazio, Suzanne Bonamici, and Greg Walden are co-sponsors.]. The \u201cAx the Tax on Middle Class Americans\u2019 Health Plans Act\u201d by New Hampshire Republican Frank Guinta\u2019s has 106 cosponsors, all Republicans. And in the Senate, a bill by Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) to repeal the Cadillac tax has 13 co-sponsors.\n\nCongress is too dysfunctional these days to pass stand-alone bills, but Leibfried thinks the proposal may gain traction as part of a larger bill later this year, such as a bill on \u201ctax extenders.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "nwLaborPress", "description": "What do Hillary, Bernie and Paul Ryan have in common?
