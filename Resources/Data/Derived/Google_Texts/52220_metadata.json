He\u2019s therefore aware that an accounting of reparations\u2019 impracticalities would be largely irrelevant to Coates\u2019 call for \u201ca national reckoning\u2026 an airing of family secrets\u2026 a settling with old ghosts.\u201d Specifically, Coates calls for the passage of HR 40, the Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act. He emphasizes that the project of studying the issue, of presenting our legislature with an authoritative account of debts incurred, and potential modes of redress, is as essential, if not more so, than the execution of reparatory transfer payments themselves.\n\nMcWhorter argues that such a reckoning would be both unnecessary and unproductive. While acknowledging racism as a scourge in American life both past and present, McWhorter is \u201cperplexed by a depiction of America as somehow blind to it.\u201d In his view, America is \u201cobsessed\u201d with its own racial history. He finds evidence of this obsession in little acts of engagement or enlightenment plucked from two randomly chosen years early in the millennium, noting, among other things, the success of a traveling exhibit of slave-ship artifacts in 2001, and a legislator\u2019s quest to remove Jefferson Davis\u2019 name from a Seattle highway in 2002. McWhorter sees an America eager to engage on issues of race, pointing to the frequent \u201cdeclamations against racism in all forms\u201d that attended media coverage of Trayvon Martin, Paula Dean, Cliven Bundy and Donald Sterling. He notes that among the best-selling nonfiction books of the last three years were Isabel Wilkerson\u2019s history of The Great Migration, \u201cThe Warmth of Other Suns,\u201d and Michelle Alexander\u2019s indictment of mass incarceration, \u201cThe New Jim Crow.\u201d He reminds us that last year\u2019s Best Picture was a nightmarish rendering of American slavery.\n\nIn McWhorter\u2019s view, if Coates\u2019 desire for a \u201cnational conversation\u201d on race has yet to be sated, it never will be, because Coates\u2019 protest is \u201cless proactive than reactive,\u201d less political than existential:\n\nFour-hundred years of slavery and Jim Crow left us unwhole, and unfortunately susceptible to a baseline sense of existential grievance as a keystone of being black.\n\nRather than asking white America for an \u201cunderstanding\u201d that will never feel complete, McWhorter calls on African-Americans to seek their assistance \u201cin making our future brighter than our present.\u201d Better to pursue the end of the drug war than a \u201csettling with old ghosts,\u201d to pursue material comfort in the future than an existential comfort with the past, if for no other reason then because that existential comfort seems impossible to attain:\n\nIn exactly what fashion could 317 million people \u201creckon\u201d or come to certain eternally elusive \u201cterms\u201d with racism? Especially in a way that would satisfy people who see even America\u2019s current atonements as insufficient?\n\nThe irony of McWhorter\u2019s argument is that, when assessing America\u2019s racial progress, he\u2019s the one elevating the symbolic over the material. In one sentence he evinces agreement with a book that depicts the incarceration of 2 million black men as Jim Crow reborn; in the next he\u2019s baffled that Coates could be dissatisfied with the \u201catonements\u201d America made by producing \u201cThe Help,\u201d or forcing Paula Dean to take a vacation.\n\nIt\u2019s true that part of Coates\u2019 argument is for the immaterial value of a national conversation, but the subject of that conversation is definitively material. Contrary to McWhorter\u2019s interpretation, Coates isn\u2019t seeking an existential \u201cconversation on race\u201d that might force the white majority to contemplate what it is to be The Other; he\u2019s asking for a conversation about what our nation\u2019s oppressive institutions have cost African-Americans, in dollars and cents.\n\nAmerica\u2019s engagement with the evils of white supremacy is not lacking in the context of prestige cinema, museum exhibits or cable news coverage of neo-confederate ranchers. In discussions of best-selling nonfiction, we can stare our history straight in the face. It\u2019s when the discussion turns to budgets that America\u2019s eyes turn away. Coates\u2019 call isn\u2019t for a conversation on \u201crace\u201d but one on reparations. He isn\u2019t seeking an acknowledgment of the effects of white supremacy on our culture, but on our political economy, on our conversations about what is owed to whom.\n\n* * *\n\nIn Coates\u2019 own telling, a central impetus for the essay was his frustration with the way our political discourse explains the persistence of the ghetto. To the nation\u2019s unrepentant racists and \u201cbravest\u201d intellectuals , the resilience of black poverty is explained by the hereditary mental inferiority of the darker races. Mainstream Republicans are more generous, casting the urban poor as victims of a government that robbed them of self-respect by helping them feed their hungry children. Even national Democrats, while paying homage to the structural origins of black poverty, signal their political bravery by pinning its persistence on a degenerate culture that glorifies men with loose pants and looser attachments to the mothers of their children. For Coates, an America that had \u201ccome to terms\u201d with its racial history would have no need for such hypotheses.\n\nIn his view, the privation of our central cities is the inevitable product of three decades of collusion between the government and the private real-estate industry, collusion aimed at locking African-Americans out of \u201cthe greatest mass-based opportunity for wealth accumulation in American history.\u201d In 1934, Congress created the Federal Housing Administration, a department tasked with insuring private mortgages, thereby reducing interest rates and the down payment necessary for purchasing a home. This subsidy, coupled with the unprecedented growth of the post-war boom economy, gave birth to the American middle class. As Coates explains, the FHA designed its policies to minimize the melanin in that class\u2019s complexion:\n\nThe FHA had adopted a system of maps that rated neighborhoods according to their perceived stability. On the maps, green areas, rated \u201cA,\u201d indicated \u201cin demand\u201d neighborhoods that, as one appraiser put it, lacked \u201ca single foreigner or Negro.\u201d These neighborhoods were considered excellent prospects for insurance. Neighborhoods where black people lived were rated \u201cD\u201d and were usually considered ineligible for FHA backing. They were colored in red.\n\nThe effect of this \u201credlining\u201d was to make integration anathema to white society. Even the most racially enlightened white person was made to understand that a black family across the street was a blow to her own family\u2019s wealth. A house ineligible for FHA backing was worth a fraction of one that was. This threat to the foundation of middle-class prosperity spurred white communities to terrorize African-Americans seeking a home in their midst. Even within their assigned ghettos, African-Americans were denied access to the legitimate mortgage market, their frustrated ambition pushing them into the hands of ruthless \u201ccontract sellers\u201d who \u201cwould sell homes at inflated prices and then evict families who could not pay \u2014 taking their down payment and their monthly installments as profit.\u201d\n\nThe incipient African-American middle class was thereby kept separate and unequal. Denied access to the spoils of the post-war boom, the stability of asset wealth, well-funded schools and public services, the black community was left uniquely vulnerable to the stagnation and contraction that\u2019s defined the last four decades of the American economy.\n\nThe greatest achievement of Coates\u2019 essay may be the way it elucidates mid-century housing discrimination through deft summaries of sociological research and vivid anecdotes from the lives of those affected. While McWhorter argues that America\u2019s engagement with its own history of racism has been obsessive, our discourse suggests white America is far from fluent in the history of the FHA.
