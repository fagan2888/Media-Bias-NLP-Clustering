There are mixed emotions from people around the Mohawk Valley about it being a green Christmas this year and not a white one.

There are some very happy people.

"Yes,” said Shirell Gamble as she clapped,” I’m so glad.”

There are some who are sad.

"I want a white Christmas so I can go snowboarding and snowmobiling and hang out with my friends," said Gabrielle Johnson.

Some said it doesn’t matter if Christmas is white or green.

"I honestly don’t care if it's going to be snowy or not, but it'd be nice if it was," said Stephanie Edwards.

Some are just happy they won’t be dealing with pains of the white stuff on Christmas.

"Once you're older and you have to drive in it and clean up the snow and scrap it off and swim through it then you don’t really need it as much," said Jessie Bieniecki.

With mixed feeling across the board about the coming green Christmas there are some who said it will change their feeling of the Holiday.

"It doesn’t necessarily mess up the whole mystic, but it does kinda take away a little bit from the image, cause when you wake up and look outside the grounds not covered with snow," said Justin White.

"As long as we can spend the time together and enjoy each other’s company then that's what Christmas is all about," said Elaine Babinec.

Even though there are mixed feelings there seemed to be a majority of people who said they are glad that there won’t be a white Christmas this year.
