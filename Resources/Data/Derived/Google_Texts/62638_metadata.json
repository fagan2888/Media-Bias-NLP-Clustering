But in North Jersey, many residents remain frustrated and confused, waiting for insurance.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s been 14 days since the first policies went into effect, but some in North Jersey say they are still unable to complete an application on the troubled government website, while others say they have enrolled but are awaiting a bill from an insurance company so they can pay their premium. Still others have yet to receive the cards showing they have coverage. And then there are those who report that they qualified for the newly expanded Medicaid program and are waiting to hear back from the state, which operates it.\n\n\n\nDavid Oscar, an insurance broker whose company manages health policies for 2,000 small businesses and 600 individuals in New Jersey, said his customers are complaining about all parts of the process.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insane out there,\u201d Oscar said. \u201cCustomers still can\u2019t get through the federal marketplace and the insurance systems can\u2019t keep up with the demand. People are upset, angry and frustrated.\u201d\n\n\n\nOf the nearly 900,000 uninsured residents in New Jersey, 34,751 selected insurance plans through the federal marketplace by the late December enrollment deadline, according to numbers released Monday by the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Another 71,142 were told they qualified for free Medicaid coverage.\n\n\n\nIt is unclear, however, how many enrollees have paid their first premium and actually have coverage \u2014 federal officials have repeatedly declined to provide those numbers to reporters.\n\n\n\nIn addition, there is indication that the U.S. health care overhaul is attracting a less healthy population \u2014 a problem that may drive up insurance premiums.\n\n\n\nAbout 24 percent of enrollees were 18- to 34-year-olds, and about one-third were 55 or older. The Obama administration wanted 18- to 34-year-olds to make up about 40 percent of total enrollment to help offset the cost of care for older and sicker people. Missing the target for the \u201cyoung invincibles\u201d may lead insurers to adjust prices if gains aren\u2019t made by the March 31 end of enrollment for coverage in 2014.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe more young, healthy people participate, the more stable the marketplace will be and the more affordable premiums will be,\u201d said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry\u2019s lobbying group.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, frustrations abound for many of those hoping to get insured through the new system. Mike Sciarra has been trying for nearly two months to enroll himself and his two kids, a 11-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son with autism, through healthcare.gov. His wife, Krissy, has coverage through her employer, which does not offer insurance to the family.\n\n\n\nAfter filling out two applications, filing two appeals, and spending countless hours on the phone with specialists, Sciarra, an independent contractor from Hawthorne, said they still don\u2019t have insurance.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy son was denied coverage and no one can tell me why,\u201d Sciarra said. \u201cI\u2019m in exactly the same place I was on Nov. 18.\n\n\n\n\u201cI did get a call on Jan. 2 from an advance resolution specialist [from the healthcare.gov website] who told me to re-register and do the whole thing all over again,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if I do that, it voids my other application and makes it look like I\u2019m just starting the process. So my kids won\u2019t have coverage until the new application takes effect and no one can promise me that one will work when the others haven\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\nMuch of the trouble in getting people signed up seems to be in transferring information from the federal government to individual insurance companies and to state Medicaid programs. At the end of December, 25,000 applications sent from the federal website to New Jersey Medicaid could not be processed because of technical difficulties.\n\n\n\nThis week, Nicole Brossoie, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Services, said federal officials have \u201cprovided workable information and Medicaid is processing the cases.\u201d The exact number of patients who enroll will be released in the middle of February, Brossoie said.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe project about 300,000 in New Jersey will come into the Medicaid program,\u201d said Joel Cantor, director of the Rutgers Center for State Health Policy. \u201cNot all of them are uninsured but most are.\u201d\n\n\n\nJoseph, a self-employed carpenter from Wayne who asked that his last name not be used, is among those waiting to see whether he has been enrolled in Medicaid. He had been buying his own insurance for years but learned his policy was going to be canceled at the end of 2013. In October, he started the process to purchase new insurance but repeated attempts on the sputtering government website were unsuccessful.\n\n\n\nBy the middle of December, Joseph, 56, learned he qualified for Medicaid and his file was supposedly forwarded to the state. By Dec. 30, Medicaid still had no record of his information so he filled out an application directly with Medicaid.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 10 days now without insurance,\u201d Joseph said on Friday. \u201cI was told it might take 30 days to process my application but that the information from healthcare.gov might conflict with it.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor those who did make it through the application process, getting an insurance card has proven to be another hurdle. Health Republic, one of the three insurance companies in New Jersey that are offering plans through the federal marketplace, requires payment of the first premium before it issues insurance cards. The other two insurers, AmeriHealth and Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, are trying to make cards available even if payment has not been received. Horizon moved its payment deadline to this Friday for coverage that began Jan. 1.\n\n\n\n\u201cThis week Horizon experienced its largest one-day volume of calls, with more than 60,000 inbound calls for all lines of business, including ACA-related calls,\u201d said Tom Vincz, a Horizon spokes\u00acman, referring to the Affordable Care Act. \u201cHorizon is still experiencing problems getting complete information from the federal marketplace.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn top of the numerous changes to deadlines, the federal government has also pushed more of the consumer information gathering and verification to health insurance companies,\u201d Vincz said. \u201cAs a result, Horizon has had to increase resources to handle the significant increase in inbound calls from members and individuals looking to purchase health insurance, pay for their coverage, and verify their coverage.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere are success stories.\n\n\n\nA 49-year-old woman from Mahwah, who asked that she be identified as Marie, said she \u201crolled the dice for the past year,\u201d living without insurance. She had coverage through her husband\u2019s job but after they divorced she couldn\u2019t afford to buy it on her own.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m relatively healthy but I paid thousands of dollars out of my pocket for doctor visits and basic tests,\u201d she said. She signed up for insurance through the marketplace and, because she qualified for subsidies, she now pays $142 a month for a plan.\n\n\n\nAnd, Jean Scully, a Rockaway resident, said she \u201cfeels wonderful\u201d now that she and her 21-year-old daughter have health insurance, after living without it for several years. She\u2019s been working as a real estate agent and a proofreader since she was laid off from her corporate job with Bell Labs in Whippany in 2002.\n\n\n\nShe bought a gold plan from AmeriHealth for about $400 a month through the new program, compared to the $800 monthly premium it would have cost her to buy a similar plan in the past.\n\n\n\n\u201cI felt like I left the middle class when I lost my health insurance,\u201d Scully said. \u201cI realized that if I broke my leg and couldn\u2019t work, I could have lost everything. Now if I get sick, I won\u2019t go bankrupt and my daughter isn\u2019t going to have to quit school. I feel like such a weight has been lifted.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhether newly insured people like Marie and Jean will start flooding doctors\u2019 offices to catch up on screenings and preventive care remains to be seen.\n\n\n\nAn informal survey by the American Academy of Family Physicians earlier this week showed that 58 percent of the 139 physicians who responded had not seen a change in their number of patients.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe thought there would be a kind of run on doctors\u2019 offices due to the implementation of the law,\u201d said Larry Downes, the chief executive officer of the Medical Society of New Jersey. \u201cBut we\u2019re not seeing any more volume than we did the same time last year.\u201d\n\n\n\nA Fair Lawn group of physicians also hasn\u2019t seen much change in patient flow.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen an influx or decrease in patients,\u201d said Steven Lumsden, executive director of New Jersey Associates in Medicine. \u201cWe will probably have a better idea after the first quarter of the year.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis article contains information from Bloomberg News.
