It\u2019s an important conversation that has drawn some pretty weird responses.\n\nMost young adults are pretty healthy, and they don\u2019t have much money. It\u2019s understandable that many are tempted to forgo health coverage. That\u2019s not a great idea. When someone \u201cgoes bare,\u201d he runs the real risk that his family and friends-ultimately the entire community-will face huge avoidable problems if he gets into a car wreck or becomes seriously ill. Some are quietly or implicitly motivated by the thought: \u201cIf something happens, the ER has to treat me, and I can just sign up for Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThis strategy is incredibly wrong-headed. EMTALA entitles you to necessary emergency care. EMTALA also entitles the hospital to send you whopping bills and to refuse to treat your important non-emergency medical needs. You can\u2019t sign up anytime for ObamaCare, either. When readily affordable options are available, going bare becomes another, especially foolish form of prolonged-adolescent free-riding.\n\nOrganized for Action is running ads that encourage middle-aged parents like me to make sure that our kids sign up. These ads make conservative ACA critics unhappy. Once young adults start buying into the new exchanges, ACA becomes part of the fabric of everyday life. Moreover, these young adults would help stabilize the risk-pools in the new health insurance marketplaces.\n\nSo a conscious campaign is afoot to convince young adults not to sign up. Advocacy groups have produced creepy ads in which a scary, speculum-wielding Uncle Sam shows up at a young woman\u2019s gynecological exam. Seemingly infinite numbers of misleading posts have argued young people will face \u201crate shock\u201d when they go to sign up.\n\n\u2018Pajama Boy\u2019 in the crosshairs\n\nThe latest kerfuffle involves an OFA ad everyone calls \u201cPajama Boy.\u201d A young man is in pajamas, holding a hot drink. The caption says: \u201cWear pajamas. Drink hot chocolate. Talk about getting health insurance.\u201d\n\nOK, that \u201cPajama Boy\u201d ad is a little dorky. It somehow brought out the crazy in some people. As MSNBC\u2019s Adam Serwer effectively notes, the conversation moved awfully quickly from the suggestion that parents check out their options on a health insurance website to a rather homophobic panic over gender and sexuality.\n\nFor example, Charles C.W. Cooke of National Review Online writes:\n\n[W]e now have Pajama Boy, a metrosexual hipster in a plaid onesie who wants you to spend your precious Christmas Day talking to him about the president\u2019s vision for health insurance.\n\nCooke\u2019s column is titled \u201cPajama Boy: The Obama Machine\u2019s Id.\u201d Since he writes an entire column based on one fairly nondescript photo, the piece provides a more revealing map of Cooke\u2019s own head:\n\nPajama Boy is OFA; and OFA is Pajama Boy. The vaguely androgynous, student-glasses-wearing, Williamsburg hipster isn\u2019t a clever marketing idea. It is the id of the Obama machine made public.\n\nCooke might be relieved to see the ad at the right \u2013 from my Facebook page. Conventional heterosexual men haven\u2019t been entirely ignored.\n\nAdam Serwer draws my attention to further antics:\n\nPajama boy can\u2019t even fight, Cooke\u2019s colleague, Jim Geraghty, surmises. \u201cMy money is on the guy from Big Bang Theory once they throw down in a slap fight.\u201d\n\nNational Review editor Rich Lowry chimed in with a Politico column titled: \u201cPajama Boy, an insufferable man-child.\u201d Something of an insufferable man-child himself, Lowry specializes in spreading juvenile memes that liberals are wusses. This prompted a satisfying (though juvenile and reckless) comeuppance when liberal comedian (now-Senator) Al Franken challenged Lowry to a fistfight. Lowry declined the challenge. This seemed wise since (a) avoidable violence is stupid, and (b) Franken is a solidly-built former wrestler.\n\n\u2018Generational theft?\u2019\n\nLowry\u2019s penultimate paragraph is the closest he comes to discussing actual health policy:\n\n[Pajama Boy] might be glad to pay more for his health insurance to include maternity benefits he doesn\u2019t need as a blow against gender stereotyping, but most young people will presumably consider Obamacare more rationally and realize it\u2019s a scheme to get them to subsidize insurance costs for older people.\n\nLowry\u2019s generational-theft argument becomes a tad unpersuasive when one remembers that an estimated 86 percent of uninsured adults between the ages of 21 and 27 can receive free or subsidized coverage through ACA. Even without subsidy, a 27-year-old nonsmoking Chicagoan can buy a Blue Choice Bronze Plan for $125/month. That\u2019s a pretty fair price.\n\nMore to the point, this rather funny OFA video exemplifies what the #GetTalking campaign is about. The ad apparently features the same Pajama-guy. He\u2019s presented as a non-dorky, independent adult. He\u2019s driving an SUV to his parents\u2019 house for dinner. On the way over, he wonders what they\u2019ve nervously invited him over to talk about. He\u2019s relieved to find out that they\u2019re worried because he\u2019s been putting off buying his health insurance.\n\nOFA\u2019s accompanying text underscores that the message is really aimed at middle-aged parents such as myself:\n\nThis holiday season, millions of Americans have a chance to get quality, affordable health insurance-many for the first time. If you have family members who are uninsured, you can play a big part in helping them find coverage that works for them. It might not always seem like it, but your family listens to you. So have the talk.\n\nThese words are entirely sensible and accurate. We owe it to our kids to have this conversation. Whatever you think of ACA, this is one of the least-objectionable suggestions in American history. In a more sane political moment, people across the ideological spectrum would support this basic call to civic and family responsibility. It\u2019s a sign of our actual political moment that Pajama Boy elicits such a strangely mean-spirited response.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Critics can joke all they want about 'Pajama Boy,' but the campaign's message is no joke: We owe it to our kids to have this conversation about having health coverage.", "og": {"site_name": "Health Insurance Resource Center", "description": "Critics can joke all they want about 'Pajama Boy,' but the campaign's message is no joke: We owe it to our kids to have this conversation about having health coverage.", "title": "\u2018Pajama Boy\u2019: Id of the anti-ACA machine", "url": "https://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2013/12/23/pajama-boy-id-of-the-anti-aca-machine/", "image": "https://www.healthinsurance.org/assets/2013/12/obamacare-pajama-boy-780x490.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1007310172}, "keywords": "ACA enrollment, EMTALA, open enrollment, Pajama Boy, Politico", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-23T12:36:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd903d\"", "article_summary": "Cooke\u2019s column is titled \u201cPajama Boy: The Obama Machine\u2019s Id.\u201d Since he writes an entire column based on one fairly nondescript photo, the piece provides a more revealing map of Cooke\u2019s own head:Pajama Boy is OFA; and OFA is Pajama Boy.\n\u2018Pajama Boy\u2019 in the crosshairsThe latest kerfuffle involves an OFA ad everyone calls \u201cPajama Boy.\u201d A young man is in pajamas, holding a hot drink.\nIt\u2019s a sign of our actual political moment that Pajama Boy elicits such a strangely mean-spirited response.\nTalk about getting health insurance.\u201dOK, that \u201cPajama Boy\u201d ad is a little dorky.\nOnce young adults start buying into the new exchanges, ACA becomes part of the fabric of everyday life."}
