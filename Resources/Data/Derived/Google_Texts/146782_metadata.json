You may not like how he did it, but he did it, because everybody\u2019s 401(k) is in a better place than it was. And those are facts.\u201d\n\nGoldberg continued, \u201cHe\u2019s not leaving a poop storm for the next person coming in that he was left. And he was left a real poop storm.\u201d\n\nThen it was Joy Behar\u2018s turn to chime in.\n\nSee Video: 'The View' Rips Trump Ad for Using Morocco as Mexico\n\n\u201cAnd yet there\u2019s so many people in this country who don\u2019t agree with that, who believe that he hasn\u2019t done a great job. It\u2019s right there in their face in my opinion,\u201d Behar offered.\u201dI don\u2019t understand that disgruntledness, frankly.\u201d\n\nLikewise, on the healthcare front, Goldberg gave Obamacare a rave review.\n\n\u201cI will speak for the small amount of people that I know who had no health care, who had no way to take care of their kids,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cThey\u2019re really happy about it.\u201d\n\nAnd, she cautioned, opponents of Obamacare would be wise to accept it.\n\nAlso Read: Don't Forget Who Killed Bin Laden: 5 Takeaways From Obama's Last State of the Union\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to get rid of it. That\u2019s the thing you have to understand. You\u2019re not going to be able to get rid of it because too many people now need it,\u201d Goldberg said. \u201cIt may not be what you need, but it\u2019s what we need as a nation. We don\u2019t always get to have what we want.\u201d\n\nRaven-Symon\u00e9, meanwhile, lamented the divisiveness in which the nation has found itself mired.\n\n\u201cIn America, we only tend to come together when there\u2019s a problem \u2026 but after that, we go right back to fighting each other, and we go right back to accusing one another of crazy things. I\u2019m sorry, what kind of country do we live in?\u201d Raven-Symon\u00e9 marveled. \u201cI\u2019m trying to have a baby and grow up and let them live in a country that Obama described last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to have a baby? I never heard this,\u201d Behar responded, which earned a rapid pivot from Raven-Symon\u00e9.\n\n\u201cBack to politics, ladies!\u201d Raven-Symon\u00e9 responded.\n\nObama First-Date Movie 'Southside With You' Reveals First Look (Photos) IM Global has released the first images from its\u00c2 film depicting the first date of Barack and Michelle Obama, \"Southside With You.\" The film covers the First Couple's first night out in 1989 when a young associate named Barack Obama (Parker Sawyers) tried\u00c2 to woo lawyer Michelle Robinson (Tika Sumpter) one summer day.
