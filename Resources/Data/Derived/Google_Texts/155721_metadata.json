He sued Obama about 30 times. He won maybe a third, depending on how you slice a win. The Environmental Protection Agency was a favored target, naturally, as was the Affordable Care Act that Abbott and Paxton have surely never called the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhat troubles me here is the difficulty I have in dividing the politics and the policy. It\u2019s particularly troublesome when it comes to an attorney general.\n\nWe had an editorial today calling on Paxton to get behind some measures that would help insulate the attorney\u2019s general office from politics. Something tells me this isn\u2019t going to be a priority for our new AG. And lest you think this is some lefty nonsense, the main reforms here are being recommended by the chief ethics lawyer from the George W. Bush administration.\n\nIt\u2019s getting more and more worrisome that the chief law enforcement officer in many states is basically a political hack \u2013 an arm of his party\u2019s bidding or special interests or both.\n\nThe suits against the Obama administration smack of this. They were so frequent they became little political ribbons Abbott waved around and Paxton danced in. That distorts the purpose of the office.\n\nPaxton won\u2019t improve this. Why should he? His voters want this kind of thing. It\u2019s dangerous. It\u2019s foolish. The attorney general, more than any other state office holder, must create as much separation from politics as possible. Absolute separation is impossible. We all understand that. Policy follows politics. But there\u2019s a difference between proper use of the powers of the office and playing naked politics with those powers.\n\nPaxton is unlikely to demonstrate he\u2019s interested in that difference. Instead, let the lawsuits flow.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL2RhbGxhc21vcm5pbmd2aWV3c2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxNS8wMS90ZXhhcy1hZy1rZW4tcGF4dG9uLXRvLWNvbnRpbnVlLWFnZ3JhdmF0aW5nLWhhYml0LW9mLXN1aW5nLXRoZS1mZWRlcmFsLWdvdmVybm1lbnQuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Rudolph Bush", "og": {"site_name": "Opinion Blog", "description": "It was too much to expect that Texas' new attorney general, Ken Paxton, would dedicate his speech yesterday to a spirit of bipartisanship and cooperation among the political parties.
