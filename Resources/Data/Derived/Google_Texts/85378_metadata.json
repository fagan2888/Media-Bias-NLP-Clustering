Instead members voted unanimously to seek suspension of Tsinker\u2019s license pending evaluation of his practice by safety specialists.\n\nIf Tsinker rejects the board\u2019s offer, as expected, he would have to defend himself at a formal administrative hearing \u2013 a lengthy and expensive process akin to a trial. He will have seven days to notify the state of his decision after he receives formal notice in the mail.\n\nTsinker, 67, said the board\u2019s vote will force him from practice after delivery of 12,000 babies.\n\n\u201cWho are we kidding?\u201d he said. \u201cThat means my retirement.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s so, South Florida will lose one of the few OBs who perform vaginal birth after a previous cesarean section, or VBAC. It may be left with no OBs who deliver breech babies via the birth canal, which Tsinker says he has done in 350 cases.\n\nAuthorities in the field of obstetrics say it is permissible, although not recommended, to perform vaginal birth for \u201cfrank breech\u201d presentation, in which the infant has entered the birth canal buttocks-first instead of head-first. It is not considered safe to attempt vaginal birth for \u201cfootling\u201d breeches, in which the presentation is foot-first.\n\nThere are few OBs who allow patients to attempt vaginal delivery after a previous cesarean, or VBAC, because of rare, life-threatening complications. It\u2019s even more difficult to find a physician willing to perform a vaginal delivery for a breech.\n\nThus Tsinker\u2019s name has been shared along the natural-birth grapevine. One woman who wrote on Vitals.com said Tsinker was the only doctor in all of South Florida who would give her a natural delivery for her son, a breech. She called him \u201ca hero.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. James Orr of Fort Myers, an OB-GYN and current chairman of the Florida Board of Medicine, said it was reckless for Tsinker to attempt vaginal delivery in a case that presented both breech and VBAC risks.\n\n\u201cIt was grossly negligent,\u201d Orr said. \u201cI\u2019m also appalled that this physician is trying to blame the patient.\u201d\n\nTsinker said the patient, identified in the record only by her initials DG, did not push when he told her to do so. Instead, he said, she disconnected the fetal monitor and went to the bathroom for half an hour. He went to the doctors\u2019 call room and by the time the nurse called him back in, the baby boy was probably already dead, Tsinker said.\n\nOrr said that was beside the point, since Tsinker should have done a C-section as soon as the patient arrived at Broward General Hospital.\n\nDr. Steven Rosenberg of West Palm Beach, the board vice chairman, said Tsinker made so many mistakes with patient DG that he should be restricted from delivering babies until he can be evaluated.\n\nThe board contracts with a University of Florida program called \u201cCARES\u201d -- Florida Comprehensive Assessment and Remedial Education Services Program -- to assess a physician\u2019s ability to practice with skill and safety.\n\nThe Department of Health and Tsinker had proposed to settle the case with a \u201cletter of concern,\u201d a fine of $10,000 and courses in record-keeping and breech births. After rejecting that as inadequate, the medical board counter-offered a suspension pending evaluation, a reprimand, and courses in ethics and empathy.\n\nThat counter-offer will be mailed to Tsinker, at which point he may accept or reject it.\n\nTsinker appeared before the board without an attorney, a rare occurrence. Earlier this week, Tsinker told Health News Florida he didn\u2019t hire a lawyer because he wasn\u2019t worried about the outcome.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the number one expert in the state of Florida as far as delivery of breech or twin babies vaginally (is) concerned,\u201d Tsinker said. \u201cNobody denies that.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, he told the board his that his low C-section rate, is unlike the majority of OBs in Florida. South Florida has the highest rate in the country, which Tsinker called \u201can abomination.\u201d\n\nBoard members told Tsinker his experience was impressive and that he\u2019s right about the C-section rate in Florida. But their mission is to safeguard the public, they said, and since he demonstrated poor judgment in this case he needs evaluation.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that under your care, you delivered a dead baby,\u201d said board member Merle Stringer of Panama City.\n\nCarol Gentry is a special correspondent with WUSF in Tampa.
