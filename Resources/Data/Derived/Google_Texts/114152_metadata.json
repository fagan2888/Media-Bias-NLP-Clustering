The New York Times reports that \u201cmany in New York\u2019s professional and cultural elite\u201d who supported Obama and ObamaCare, and carved themselves out a sweet little health insurance pool \u201cto avoid the sky-high rates in New York\u2019s individual insurance market,\u201d are now out in the cold with the rest of us:\n\n[U]nder the Affordable Care Act, they will be treated as individuals, responsible for their own insurance policies. For many of them, that is likely to mean they will no longer have access to a wide network of doctors and a range of plans tailored to their needs. And many of them are finding that if they want to keep their premiums from rising, they will have to accept higher deductible and co-pay costs or inferior coverage.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe anguish these elite Obama supporters are going through is no different than those 5.9 million in the real world victimized by insurance cancelations: Stress, sleepless nights, financial burden, and the loss of familiar doctors and hospitals. \u201cWe are Obama\u2019s people,\u201d said one author. Today her insurance has been canceled and her doctors are not available through the exchanges. And she is not alone. Take Barbara Meinwald, a solo practitioner lawyer in Manhattan. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep because of it,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Meinwald, 61, has been paying $10,000 a year for her insurance through the New York City Bar. A broker told her that a new temporary plan with fewer doctors would cost $5,000 more, after factoring in the cost of her medications.\n\nMs. Meinwald also looked on the state\u2019s health insurance exchange. But she said she found that those plans did not have a good choice of doctors, and that it was hard to even find out who the doctors were, and which hospitals were covered. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re blindfolded and you\u2019re told that you have to buy something,\u201d she said. \u2026\n\nMeinwald now says that had she known this would happen, she would have voted for Mitt Romney.\n\n[M]any professionals make too much money to qualify for the subsidies, and even if they are able to find comparably priced insurance, the new policies do not have the coverage they are accustomed to.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Foundation, these people were intentionally screwed. Although their policies did meet the minimum ObamaCare coverage standards, The Times reports, the policies were still canceled as a way \u201cto prevent associations from selling insurance to healthy members who are needed to keep the new health exchanges financially viable.\u201d\n\nIf only the same thing would happen to the elite media, we might actually get somewhere in repealing a boondoggle that is victimizing millions in the working and middle class only to benefit a few thousand.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "If there is at least one benefit of ObamaCare it is watching those who supported nationalizing the purchase of mandated health insurance get their comeuppance.
