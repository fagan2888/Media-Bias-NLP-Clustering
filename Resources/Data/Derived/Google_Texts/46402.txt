To the Editor:

Recent articles, such as “U.S. Chamber Travels the World, Fighting Curbs on Smoking” (front page, July 1), unfairly portray some of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s global activities on behalf of the protection of intellectual property and trademarks as a campaign to promote smoking and fight antismoking measures.

The U.S. Chamber does not support smoking and wants people to quit. We promote wellness nationally and globally, and we sponsor smoking cessation plans for our own employees.

At the same time, the U.S. Chamber regularly urges governments to protect intellectual property and comply with their international commitments, and we’ve done so for a wide variety of industries. Measures that violate these standards and single out one industry for discriminatory treatment can easily spread, which is why dozens of other business and agricultural organizations have expressed the same concerns.
