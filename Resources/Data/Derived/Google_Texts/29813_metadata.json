Todd Baugh with a lifetime achievement award for his decades of service.\n\n\u201cWhile we recognize that Judge Baugh made a very public mistake \u2026 we feel his more than 30 years of service to our community and our profession is worthy of recognition,\u201d the board said in a statement.\n\nNews that Baugh was to be honored galvanized women\u2019s rights activists whose protests over Baugh\u2019s courtroom remarks and his sentencing of the rape defendant led to his reprimand in July by the Montana Supreme Court.\n\nHundreds have joined a social media campaign launched this week, a prelude to a petition expected to be posted online this weekend demanding the bar association rescind its decision, said Marian Bradley, regional director in Montana of the National Organization for Women.\n\nBaugh retired in December, roughly six months after state justices cited him for undermining public confidence in the judiciary by commenting that the teen girl, Cherice Moralez, was \u201cas much in control of the situation\u201d as the ex-teacher, Stacey Rambold, who was convicted of raping her in 2007.\n\nMoralez killed herself before the case could be brought to trial.\n\nState justices also found that Baugh imposed an unlawfully lenient term of incarceration when he sentenced Rambold to 15 years in prison with all but 31 days suspended. The court said Montana law required a sentence of at least four years for a defendant guilty of sexually assaulting a victim under 16.\n\nBradley on Friday faulted the bar association for seeking to refurbish the image of a judge whose remarks and actions raised troubling questions about the state legal system\u2019s attitudes toward women and rape.\n\n\u201cIt sends the wrong message to women and children of Montana and the nation when you hold up this judge as a model,\u201d she said.\n\n(Reporting by Laura Zuckerman in Salmon, Idaho; Editing by Steve Gorman and Eric Beech)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Judge-holding-scales-of-justice-via-Shutterstock-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Montana bar association honors a judge censured for victim blaming in underage rape case"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "A Montana bar association on Friday defended its controversial decision to honor a former judge who was censured for suggesting that a 14-year-old girl was partly to blame for her rape by a teacher whom the judge sentenced to just 31 days.\n\u201cWhile we recognize that Judge Baugh made a very public mistake \u2026 we feel his more than 30 years of service to our community and our profession is worthy of recognition,\u201d the board said in a statement.\nBradley on Friday faulted the bar association for seeking to refurbish the image of a judge whose remarks and actions raised troubling questions about the state legal system\u2019s attitudes toward women and rape.\n\u201cIt sends the wrong message to women and children of Montana and the nation when you hold up this judge as a model,\u201d she said.\nThe board of the Yellowstone Area Bar Association, a private organization of attorneys in the Billings area, said it voted to present retired state District Judge G.
