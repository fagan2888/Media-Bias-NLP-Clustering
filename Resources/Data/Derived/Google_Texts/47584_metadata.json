CONCORD, N.H. (AP) \u2014 A shuttered hotel where the nation's first presidential primary ballots have been traditionally cast will once against host midnight voting in 2016, according to developers working to overhaul and expand the historic resort.\n\nThe nearly 150-year-old Balsams resort in Dixville Notch closed in September 2011, and its new owners are still waiting for environmental permits to move ahead with extensive restoration plans, which include a new hotel and conference center and a larger ski area. That has raised questions about the fate of the primary voting tradition, but project spokesman Scott Tranchemontagne said the goal is to have a portion of the resort's Dix House ready for the February primary.\n\n\n\nSEE ALSO: 'Run, Joe, run': Biden hints at possible presidential pitc\n\n\"The desire is to continue the tradition of voting first in the first-in-the-nation primary,\" he said. \"We believe that it's important not only for Dixville but for all of the North Country and quite frankly, for the state of New Hampshire. This voting tradition in Dixville has garnered a great deal of attention for not only the Balsams but for the region and the state.\"\n\nIf Dix House isn't ready, voting also could be held in Hale House, another building on the property that most recently served as the chef's quarters, he said.\n\nSee photos of the resort:\n\n\n\nShuttered resort still plans to host New Hampshire voters FILE - In this May 10, 2012, file photo, a large sign hangs in front of the Balsams Hotel in Dixeville Notch, N.H., where an auction was scheduled to clear out the nearly 150-year-old resort. A bill to pave the way for an ambitious plan to restore the resort got the go-ahead from New Hampshire's House of Representatives Wednesday, May 6, 2015. The bill would create a special taxing district allowing the state to back $28 million in bonds toward redeveloping the Balsams, which closed in 2011.

Hale in 1895, is shown March 24, 2006 in Dixville Notch, New Hampshire. In 1918, Hale added a new wing seen to the right, doubling the capacity of the resort to its current 400 guests. The resort is located on a 15,000 acres, with golfing in the summer and skiing in the winter.

Hart's Location suspended the midnight voting in 1964 and brought it back in 1996. Eager for some of the spotlight, Balsams owner Neil Tillotson arranged for early voting at the hotel by having Dixville incorporated in 1960 solely for voting.\n\nIn 2012, the hotel opened for one night for the presidential primary. Mitt Romney and Jon Hunstman tied for first place on the GOP side with two votes apiece, and Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul each got one vote. For the Democrats, President Barack Obama received three votes.\n\nNone of the 2016 presidential hopefuls has visited the hotel this year, but Tranchemontagne said several have expressed interested. He said there likely will be 10 or so resort workers living on the property by February who could vote.\n\nMeanwhile, the tiny town of Millsfield next door to Dixville also plans to open its polls at midnight for its approximately 20 voters. According to news reports, the community voted at midnight in 1952, but never made it a tradition.\n\n\n\nMore on AOL.com:\n\nUnseasonal sandstorm hits Lebanon, Syria\n\nEnd to Brady suspension a game-changer for NFL fantasy football\n\nPlanned Parenthood faces unexpected challenge from Obamacare", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.aol.com/assets-3af9d6a02a9854da3646959922f4fe0c/images/favicon/browserconfig.xml?v=Kmmv6Rgb5o", "description": "A shuttered hotel where the nation's first presidential primary ballots have been traditionally cast will once against host midnight voting in 2016.", "author": "AOL Staff", "og": {"site_name": "AOL.com", "description": "A shuttered hotel where the nation's first presidential primary ballots have been traditionally cast will once against host midnight voting in 2016.", "title": "Shuttered resort still plans to host New Hampshire voters", "url": "http://www.aol.com/article/2015/09/08/shuttered-resort-still-plans-to-host-new-hampshire-voters/21232931/", "image": "http://www.blogcdn.com/slideshows/images/slides/361/126/8/S3611268/slug/l/balsams-redevelopment-1.jpg", "app_id": 183146218394780, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.aol.com", "account_id": 66237835, "title": "Shuttered resort still plans to host New Hampshire voters", "image": "http://www.blogcdn.com/slideshows/images/slides/361/126/8/S3611268/slug/l/balsams-redevelopment-1.jpg", "creator": "@AOL", "site": "@AOL", "card": "summary", "description": "A shuttered hotel where the nation's first presidential primary ballots have been traditionally cast will once against host midnight voting in 2016."}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#3399ff", "robots": "index,follow", "publish-date": "September 8, 2015", "p": {"domain_verify": "96bae1739d3231d21abe59a638021d5d"}, "fb": {"app_id": 183146218394780}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.aol.com/assets-43dafc02cf4f3bf4849e499b04c0aa82/images/favicon/mstile-144x144.png?v=Kmmv6Rgb5o", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/aol"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb11\"", "article_summary": "See photos of the resort:Shuttered resort still plans to host New Hampshire voters FILE - In this May 10, 2012, file photo, a large sign hangs in front of the Balsams Hotel in Dixeville Notch, N.H., where an auction was scheduled to clear out the nearly 150-year-old resort.\n(Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post via Getty Images) In this Jan. 25, 2004 file photo, the Balsams Grand Resort Hotel is seen in Dixville Notch, N.H.\nHart's Location suspended the midnight voting in 1964 and brought it back in 1996.\nIn the small northern New Hampshire town of Dixville, since the 1960 election, the U.S. presidential primary voting has been held at midnight, at Balsams Grand Resort Tuesday, Dixville, New Hampshire, January 10, 2012.\n(AP Photo/Robert f.
