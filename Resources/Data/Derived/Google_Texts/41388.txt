Because this is the kind of thing we love to see our elected officials doing, four Democratic senators are openly criticizing the Golden Globes because one or two celebrities at the event were smoking e-cigarettes during the awards ceremony Sunday, calling it a horrible influence on young people who were watching.

Leonardo DiCaprio was spotted smoking an e-cigarette at the Globes, but the most prominent use was by Seinfeld and Veep star Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who smoked an e-cigarette on camera for a gag set up by hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, but Senators Dick Durbin, Richard Blumenthal, Sherrod Brown, and Edward Markey were apparently the only ones not laughing.

“The Golden Globes celebrates entertainers who are an influence on young fans,” the four Democratic senators wrote on Tuesday. “We ask the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and NBC Universal to take actions to ensure that future broadcasts of the Golden Globes do not intentionally feature images of e-cigarettes.” “Such action would help to avoid the glamorization of smoking and protect the health of young fans,” said the letter signed by Dick Durbin of Illinois, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Edward Markey of Massachusetts.”

And even more shocking of all: NBC, the same network that broadcast the Golden Globes, also featured a shocking advertisement for electronic meth!

Also criticizing the Globes for allowing two of its stars to smoke e-cigarettes is Fox News’ Dr. Manny Alvarez, who accused Hollywood of having a “double standard when it comes to smoking.”

For a refresher, you can watch the gag with Louis-Dreyfus below (it starts up around the 4-minute mark), via NBC:
