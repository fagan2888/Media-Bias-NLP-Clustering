It\u2019s a thrumming hive filled with vast amounts of data, knowledge, commerce and media and an equally vast number of gloriously bizarre arguments, grumpy cats and adorable sloths. Also, bots. Lots and lots of bots.\n\nBots are software applications built to perform automated tasks. They can be valuable, as with search engines crawling and indexing websites. They can also be malicious, like those used by hackers and spammers.\n\nA report released this week by Incapsula, a cloud-based web-security service, found that 61.5 percent of all website traffic now comes from these non-human visitors. If you\u2019re reading this and you\u2019re human, you\u2019re apparently in the minority.\n\nRelated: Amazon Plans Delivery by Drones: The Best Tweets\n\nIncapsula based its findings on 1.45 billion bot visits, over a 90-day period, to 20,000 sites on its own network. That network may not be perfectly representative of the entire web, but it offers a sense of who, or what, is out there.\n\nBot traffic is up by a fifth from last year, according to Incapsula. Most of that growth comes from \u201cgood bots,\u201d like those from analytics companies and search engines that are crawling sites more frequently. Legitimate bot activity has jumped 55 percent, which Incapsula suggests is largely the result of new online services and increased crawling by search engines seeking the timeliest results. Those search engines and other good bots account for 31 percent of web traffic.\n\nAnother 30.5 percent of traffic comes from malicious bots, including \u201cscrapers,\u201d which look to steal content or email addresses; \u201chacking tools\u201d; a shrinking pool of spammers; and a growing group of what Incapsula calls \u201cother impersonators\u201d and describes as \u201cunclassified bots with hostile intentions.\u201d\n\nMalicious bot traffic as a percentage of overall traffic hasn\u2019t changed, but the specific kinds of bot activity has shifted, Incapsula said. Spam bots have decreased from two percent of traffic in 2012 to 0.5 percent this year. \u201cThe most plausible explanation for this steep decrease is Google\u2019s anti-spam campaign,\u201d the report said.\n\nActivity by more sophisticated impersonator bots \u2013 \u201cthe tools of top-tier hackers who are proficient enough to create their own malware\u201d \u2013 has risen, though. These impersonators are usually custom-made for a specific activity that involves penetrating a website\u2019s security, according to the report. \u201cThe 8 percent increase in the number of such bots highlights the increased activity of such hackers,\u201d Incapsula said, \u201cas well as the rise in targeted cyber-attacks.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A report released this week found that 61.5 percent of all website traffic now comes from bots.", "title": "Humans Now Account for Less Than 40% of Web Traffic", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/14/Humans-Now-Account-Less-40-Web-Traffic-Infographic", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02172012_Binary_Computers_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/14/Humans-Now-Account-Less-40-Web-Traffic-Infographic", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02172012_Binary_Computers_article.jpg", "creator": "@yuvalrosenberg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A report released this week found that 61.5 percent of all website traffic now comes from bots.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaa4b\"", "article_summary": "Those search engines and other good bots account for 31 percent of web traffic.\nThey can be valuable, as with search engines crawling and indexing websites.\nBot traffic is up by a fifth from last year, according to Incapsula.\nMost of that growth comes from \u201cgood bots,\u201d like those from analytics companies and search engines that are crawling sites more frequently.\nIf you\u2019re reading this and you\u2019re human, you\u2019re apparently in the minority."}
