They had a full week of preparation this week so they\u2019re up.\n\nThe question is whether Hillman and Webster got Wally Pipp\u2019ed. Hillman was the No. 2 running back behind Montee Ball through the offseason, training camp and preseason, but No. 3 tailback C.J. Anderson ran well last week against Indianapolis, rushing four times for 27 yards.\n\nThe Broncos will dress all four running backs from their 53-man roster today \u2014 Ball, Hillman, Anderson and rookie Juwan Thompson, who plays on multiple special-teams units.\n\nWebster was supposed to open as the Broncos\u2019 No. 3 corner, or nickelback, but rookie Bradley Roby had an impressive debut last week against the Colts.\n\nWith Webster playing today, the Broncos will place cornerback Tony Carter on the inactive list.\n\n\n\n***\n\nBut while the Broncos get Hillman and Webster back, they will not have their special teams captain today against the Chiefs.\n\nDavid Bruton won\u2019t dress as he continues to recover from the dislocated shoulder he suffered in the opener last week against the Indianapolis Colts. Bruton was blasted on a touchback by the Colts\u2019 Colt Anderson.\n\nAlso inactive for Denver: Rookie WR Cody Latimer, CB Tony Carter, T Mike Schofield, G Ben Garland, LB Danny Trevathan.
