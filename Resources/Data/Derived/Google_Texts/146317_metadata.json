I\u2019m not joking. Here are some of the President\u2019s main tax hikes that have been enacted or proposed.\n\nObama imposed higher income tax rates on upper-income taxpayers as part of the fiscal cliff deal.\n\nObama also succeeded in increasing the double-taxation of dividends and capital gains for successful taxpayers.\n\nObamacare was a budget-busting nightmare with lots of tax increases, but the biggest tax hike targeted rich taxpayers.\n\nObama\u2019s proposed solution for Social Security\u2019s huge unfunded liability is a large tax increase on taxpayers making more than $100,000 per year.\n\nObama also has proposed big tax hikes for American companies trying to compete in global markets.\n\nThis list could continue, but I think you get the point. American leftists are like malfunctioning Chatty Cathy Dolls. No matter how many times you pull the string, all that comes out is \u201ctax the rich.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say, that\u2019s both tiresome and empty.\n\nAt some point, it would be nice for Obama and other statists to actually identify how much is enough.\n\nFor instance, should any taxpayer ever have to give more than 40 percent of their income to government? More than 50 percent? Perhaps over 100 percent, like the 8,000 French household that had every penny of earnings confiscated in 2012? And what\u2019s the \u201cfair share\u201d for the rich? Should they pay 40 percent of the tax burden? Or 50 percent? Or more? Heck, it might not be a bad idea to actually identify the rich. Is a household \u201crich\u201d if annual income climbs above $200,000? Or do we simply define rich people as being anyone in the top 10 percent, or top 20 percent?\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t care about the answers to these questions because I favor a simple and fair flat tax that doesn\u2019t punish people for contributing more to the economy\u2019s output. I simply want the government to treat everyone equally and collect revenue in the least-destructive manner.\n\nThat being said, I imagine that Obama and other leftists would hem and haw if any reporters actually acted like journalists and asked tough questions. In their hearts, the class-warfare types probably want to go back to the 70 percent-plus top tax rates of the Jimmy Carter era. But they presumably wouldn\u2019t want to openly confess those views.\n\nJust in case Obama (or Pelosi, Reid, etc) ever are pressed to answer these questions, here are numbers that should help put their answers in context.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s a chart from the experts at the Tax Foundation and it reveals that the top-10 percent of taxpayers finance about 70 percent of the federal income tax.\n\nThe typical left-wing response to this kind of data is to complain that it doesn\u2019t include the Social Security payroll tax and other levies.\n\nThat\u2019s a semi-fair point, and it\u2019s true that the so-called \u201cFICA\u201d tax (at least the part that goes to Social Security) is not \u201cprogressive.\u201d Instead, it\u2019s a flat-rate levy. Moreover, the portion of the payroll tax used to fund Social Security is only imposed on income up to $118,500, which leads many leftists to say the system is regressive.\n\nThat\u2019s inaccurate for the simple reason that Social Security\u2019s benefit formula is far more generous to lower-income taxpayers. It\u2019s also worth pointing out that the program is supposed to be a form of social insurance, not a redistribution scheme (though it\u2019s actually both).\n\nAnd that point is a perfect segue for the next chart. Mark Perry of the American Enterprise Institute used numbers from the Congressional Budget Office to measure the net effect (taxes and spending) of fiscal policy for the five income quintiles.\n\nAs you can see, the bottom 60 percent are net recipients and the top 20 percent are basically pulling the wagon for everyone.\n\nRemember, this chart doesn\u2019t mean that the bottom 60 percent don\u2019t pay any tax. It just means that they get more money from the government, on average, than they put into the system.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve shared some numbers, let\u2019s close with some economic analysis.\n\nObama\u2019s class-warfare agenda is wrong because it\u2019s unfair and discriminatory. But it\u2019s also terribly misguided because high tax rates are bad for growth and competitiveness.\n\nBesides, there is a point at which high tax rates don\u2019t generate much, if any, additional revenue. Simply stated, rich taxpayers have considerable control over the timing, level, and composition of their income. And that means they can reduce their taxable income when tax rates increase.\n\nMy video on class warfare has more information. Make sure to pay extra-close attention at the 4:35 mark.\n\nP.S. If you don\u2019t believe my argument about rich people having the ability to alter their taxable income, check out the IRS data from the 1980s.\n\nP.P.S. Only a fool (or a malicious person) wants to be at the revenue-maximizing point of the Laffer Curve. The right goal is to set tax rates at the growth-maximizing level.\n\nP.P.P.S. For what it\u2019s worth, a poll in 2012 found that 75 percent of Americans think the top tax rate should be no higher than 30 percent. That can\u2019t be very comforting data for the hate-and-envy crowd.\n\nDaniel J.
