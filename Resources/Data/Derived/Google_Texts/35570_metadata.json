Burwell, Scalia called the majority\u2019s reasoning for upholding ObamaCare subsidies \u201cpure applesauce.\u201d\n\nAnd in 2012, during oral arguments in the first case challenging the healthcare law, Scalia questioned whether the administration could force people to buy broccoli if it required people to have health insurance.\n\n\u201cCould you define the market \u2014 everybody has to buy food sooner or later, so you define the market as food, therefore, everybody is in the market; therefore, you can make people buy broccoli,\u201d he said.\n\nScalia died unexpectedly last Saturday while on a hunting trip in Texas. He was 79.\n\nHis casket arrived at the Supreme Court Friday morning and was placed in the court's Great Hall on the catafalque, first used for President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nA funeral Mass will be held at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception starting at 11 a.m. on Saturday. A private burial will follow.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The unusual items became symbols of the ObamaCare debate.", "description": "The unusual items became symbols of the ObamaCare debate.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Lydia Wheeler", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The unusual items became symbols of the ObamaCare debate.", "title": "Applesauce, broccoli left at Supreme Court in Scalia's memory", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/270032-applesauce-broccoli-left-at-supreme-court-in-memory-of-scalia", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/scaliamemorial02192016getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-19T14:11:54-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-19T14:11-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/270032-applesauce-broccoli-left-at-supreme-court-in-memory-of-scalia", "dcterms.date": "2016-02-19T13:51-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Lydia Wheeler", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Antonin Scalia, Conservatism in the United States, King v.
