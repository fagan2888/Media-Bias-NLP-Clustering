I look forward to working with him to ensure greater transparency and competition in New Jersey's health care market.\"\n\nRelated Story Sweeney wants financial data from hospitals, which seem eager to comply\n\nCodey previously said she asked Sweeney to include insurers in the call for transparency.\n\nWard Sanders, president of the New Jersey Association of Health Plans, said:\n\n\"We are sure carriers will review the Senate president\u2019s letters and provide information responsive to his requests. Insurers already are required to provide detailed financial reporting to state (Department of Banking and Insurance) and federal (Internal Revenue Service and Securities and Exchange Commission) regulators, and some of this information is already available publicly.\n\n\"And, unlike other health care stakeholders, insurers are held to value standards under state and federal laws through what is called a 'minimum loss ratio requirement' \u2014 whereby an insurer must demonstrate that it paid at least 80 or 85 cents (depending on the market) of the overall premium dollar in claim payments to hospitals, providers and for other direct services or must provide refunds to policyholders. This acts as an effective cap on insurance profits, caps which do not exist for hospitals, physicians, pharmaceutical companies or others in health care.\n\n\"We hope that this dialogue will result in greater value standards for all participants in health care and greater transparency for consumers.\"\n\nHealth Republic of New Jersey, one of few health insurance companies that does 100 percent of its business in the state, agreed to comply with Sweeney's request.\n\n\u201cThe financial state of affairs of health care in the U.S. is so fragmented that it gets out of balance from time to time,\u201d said CEO Robert Meehan. \u201cThe state is now challenged to bring it back to focus.\n\n\u201cIt deserves a rich and robust conversation in Trenton,\u201d he said, adding that the controversy is forcing the focus onto issues stemming from the fragmentation in the industry.\n\nHorizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, whose OMNIA plan is at the root of the sudden push for transparency, immediately responded to a request for information.\n\n\"Net income for 2014 decreased to $147.5 million from $214.1 million in 2013,\" according to information provided by Horizon.\n\n\u201cWe will absolutely be providing the Senate president with everything he has requested and we welcome greater financial transparency for everyone involved with health care,\" said Kevin McArdle, public affairs manager at Horizon. \"Unlike some hospitals, Horizon BCBSNJ operated on less than a 1.5 percent operating profit margin in 2014. Horizon paid $427.1 million total federal, state and local taxes and insurance assessments in 2014. Detailed financial information about Horizon has been published in our annual reports for years and is available online at http://www.horizonblue.com/sites/default/files/2014_annual_report_042415.pdf.\u201d\n\nCigna also provided information on its loss ratios:\n\nFor the small business segment:\n\nCigna Health and Life Insurance Co. had a ratio of 0.898 (compared with a minimum standard of 0.80);\n\nConnecticut General Life Insurance Co. had an MLR of 0.986 (compared with a minimum standard of 0.80).\n\nFor the large business segment:\n\nCHLIC had an MLR of 0.875 (compared with a minimum standard of 0.85);\n\nCGLIC had an MLR of 0.876 (compared with a minimum standard of .85);\n\nCigna Health Care of New Jersey had an MLR of 0.850 (compared with a minimum standard of .85).\n\n\"UnitedHealthcare will review and respond to the request sent out today by Senate President Sweeney,\" the insurer said in a statement. \"As required by the Department of Banking and Insurance, we file detailed financial information annually, complying with all federal and state laws and regulations, including the Affordable Care Act and minimum loss ratio requirements. All information is publicly available.\u201d\n\nPublic filings for AmeriHealth show the insurer saw a net loss of $46 million in 2015, compared with a gain of $15 million in 2014.\n\nAetna declined to comment.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20160311/NJBIZ01/160319932/update-sweeney-seeking-financial-data-from-insurers-as-well-as-hospitals", "site_name": "NJBIZ", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20160311/NJBIZ01/160319932/AR/0/AR-160319932.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Update: Sweeney seeking financial data from insurers as well as hospitals | NJBIZ"}, "twitter": {"site": "@njbiz", "domain": "njbiz.com", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20160311/NJBIZ01/160319932/AR/0/AR-160319932.jpg"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Update: Sweeney seeking financial data from insurers as well as hospitals | NJBIZ"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd291d\"", "article_summary": "Related Story Sweeney wants financial data from hospitals, which seem eager to complyCodey previously said she asked Sweeney to include insurers in the call for transparency.\nState Senate President Stephen Sweeney on Friday took another step in the ongoing controversy over insurance plans in the state.\n(Editor's note: This report was updated at 3:35 p.m. with additional comments and financial information.)\nI look forward to working with him to ensure greater transparency and competition in New Jersey's health care market.\"\nAfter a Senate Commerce Committee hearing Monday, Sweeney (D-West Deptford) said he would call on all hospitals to reveal financial data for the past 10 years."}
