As a side benefit, this opposition delivers limitless opportunities for one-liners that can fire up a base-dominated crowd at political events.\n\nThus, re-authorizing the Ex-Im Bank has become a bit of a political hang-up.\n\nThis is ironic if one views the role of the bank fairly.\n\nThe bank does not, in fact, aid foreign countries, governments or businesses. It plays precisely the opposite role.\n\nBy allowing American companies, mostly very large ones, to finance the products they want to sell to a foreign company or government at a reduced rate, the Ex-Im Bank in fact represents an American commercial threat to foreign companies. It is the antithesis of foreign assistance.\n\nThere will always be \u201cbig business,\u201d for the very simple reason that in some cases it just takes big business to build big things, such as construction equipment and airplanes.\n\nThe question is not whether such businesses will exist. The question is who will get the jobs spawned by their activities: us, in the United States; or them, in other countries?\n\nPart of the answer is determined by who offers the best price.\n\nThis is where the Ex-Im Bank gives our guys \u2014 the guys who employ Americans \u2014 a better chance to compete.\n\nThis is especially true since most of the rest of the industrialized world, especially France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan and China, do a lot more table-tilting than we do, with direct and indirect government help for their \u201cbig businesses.\u201d\n\nMore substantive is the right\u2019s concern that the bank\u2019s activities amount to the government picking winners and losers, and supporting the big boys with influence.\n\nTo be fair, this is basically true. But what is the real cost of such support?\n\nIt is very little, so far as the taxpayer is concerned. In fact the Ex-Im Bank returns a few billion dollars a year to U.S. taxpayers.\n\nThis added income can then be spent by the same members of Congress who oppose the bank on really expensive industrial policy, such as agriculture subsidies or energy tax breaks.\n\nThese programs are industrial policy on steroids.\n\nBut they also come free of talk about foreign activities and banks, and other such things that raise the heckles of the conspiratorially-minded.\n\nIn a perfect world, where the playing fields of international commerce are level, the Ex-Im Bank should be scrapped. But such a world does not exist. It is not going to come into existence anytime soon.\n\nDumping the Ex-Im Bank would provoke some celebratory chest-beating by those who reside at the extremes of right and left. But it would also bring on more federal debt, as the costs currently covered by the contributions of the Ex-Im Bank to the U.S. Treasury Department would have to be covered by borrowing.\n\nIt would also result in the loss of many American sales, which would instead be racked up by subsidized foreign competitors.\n\nThis, in turn, would bring the distinct possibility of the loss of American jobs \u2014 either directly due to the loss of sales, or indirectly, because of the need to move production overseas to become more competitive.\n\nSome claim that this will not happen because the companies that use Ex-Im financing can easily get financing without government back-up.\n\nThis may be true. But, then again, it may be false.\n\nBy the time the jury returns its verdict, the sales may be lost, the jobs may be gone and the Treasury department will definitely be poorer.\n\nJudd Gregg (R) is a former governor and three-term senator from New Hampshire who served as chairman and ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee and as ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Foreign Operations subcommittee.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "OPINION | In a perfect world, Ex-Im Bank should be scrapped.", "description": "OPINION | In a perfect world, Ex-Im Bank should be scrapped.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Judd Gregg", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "OPINION | In a perfect world, Ex-Im Bank should be scrapped.", "title": "Judd Gregg: We need Ex-Im in real world", "url": "http://thehill.com/opinion/judd-gregg/213453-judd-gregg-we-need-ex-im-in-real-world", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/shipping-containers.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T04:20-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/opinion/judd-gregg/213453-judd-gregg-we-need-ex-im-in-real-world", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-07-28T06:17-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Megan Ruyle", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-28T06:17:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:20:37-05:00"}, "keywords": ",,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/opinion/judd-gregg/213453-judd-gregg-we-need-ex-im-in-real-world", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "OPINION | In a perfect world, Ex-Im Bank should be scrapped.", "card": "summary", "title": "Judd Gregg: We need Ex-Im in real world"}, "dcterms.title": "Judd Gregg: We need Ex-Im in real world"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fced1f\"", "article_summary": "There will always be \u201cbig business,\u201d for the very simple reason that in some cases it just takes big business to build big things, such as construction equipment and airplanes.\nBig business does things for profit and there is no social justice in that, just people making money and doing other bad stuff.\nThis is where the Ex-Im Bank gives our guys \u2014 the guys who employ Americans \u2014 a better chance to compete.\nIn a perfect world, where the playing fields of international commerce are level, the Ex-Im Bank should be scrapped.\nThus both sides meet in their general opposition to things like the Ex-Im Bank, which check all their boxes of ideological concern."}
