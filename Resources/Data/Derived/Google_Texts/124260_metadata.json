They were, after all, the ones who asked Australian Sen. Jacqui Lambie about the state of her bikini line, which led her to wax on about what she looks for in men. \u201cThey must have heaps of cash and they\u2019ve got to have a package between their legs,\u201d she told the \"Kim and Dave Show.\" \u201cThey don\u2019t even need to speak.\u201d The hosts then brokered a date between Lambie and a 22-year-old Tasmanian who assured the senator he was \u201chung like a donkey.\u201d\n\nNot your typical morning show banter. But then Lambie isn\u2019t your typical senator. Her life story is the stuff of a Lifetime movie. An ex-corporal in the Australian Army and a single mother of two, she lost a stripe for punching a fellow soldier, waged a 10-year disability battle with the army, and attempted suicide by stepping in front of an oncoming car. She survived, and last September won a senate seat as a member of the Palmer United Party.\n\nThe Palmer United Party, or PUP, holds just four of the senate\u2019s 76 seats. But because the Coalition, Australia\u2019s governing party, failed to win an outright majority in the senate, PUP now holds the balance of power. If Prime Minister Tony Abbott wants to pass his legislation, he needs to go through PUP. And since the new senate first convened on July 1, PUP has made clear that if Abbott wants its votes, he\u2019s going to have to work for them.\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons]\n\nThat\u2019s a tough assignment for Abbott, because no real ideology unites PUP. Instead, it is a blend of free-floating populism and outsized personalities. No personality is more outsized than Clive Palmer, the megalomaniacal mining magnate more interested in attention than political power. Two weeks ago he spiked the carbon tax repeal just hours before it was supposed to pass, earning him an extra week in the spotlight. As one of my Sydney-based colleagues put it, \u201cImagine if Donald Trump had his own party, and that party controlled the balance of power in the Senate.\u201d That\u2019s Clive Palmer and PUP.\n\nNow imagine Trump\u2019s party had scraped together a ragtag group of inexperienced populists rejected by the Republican Party. That\u2019s the PUP bloc of senators, which looks an awful lot like a microcosm of the tea party. Lambie, for instance, has more personality than policy knowledge. She initially went on record in support of the country\u2019s now-defunct carbon tax, until reminded that PUP actually supported its repeal. \u201cI just buggered that up,\u201d she shrugged to reporters.\n\nHer fellow senators include Glenn Lazarus, a former rugby player whose thick, rectangular shape earned him the nickname \u201cThe Brick with Eyes,\u201d and Dio Wang, the CEO of the Palmer-controlled corporation Australasian Resources. Wang won his seat after a missing-ballot scandal led to a statewide re-election, an event unprecedented in Australian politics. Asked about his interest in politics prior to running for office, Wang answered, \u201cZero.\u201d\n\nJoining the three PUP senators is Ricky Muir, a member of the Australia Motoring Enthusiast Party who agreed to vote with PUP. Muir, who lost his job when the sawmill he worked for closed up shop, was ill-prepared for the national spotlight. There was the infamous \u201croo poo\u201d video, which caught him in a kangaroo dung fight with his friends. Then there was his Palin-esque television interview, full of deer-in-headlight stares and multiple requests to start his answers over. After one particularly spectacular flub, he asked to step out for a minute. Palmer, seeing a chance to seize the spotlight, rushed to Muir\u2019s defense, calling the interviewer a \u201cdickhead\u201d with a \u201cplum stuck up his arse.\u201d\n\n[READ: Should We Go Back to the Moon?]\n\nFor all their flaws, the PUP senators signal the continuing power of populism in politics. They leveraged their inexperience and underdog status as part of their appeal: vote for us if you\u2019re tired of politics as usual. Muir, though he only won about a thousand votes to get to the senate, proudly proclaimed himself a voice for the \u201cordinary, everyday Australian.\u201d Wang claimed to be running against the hypocrites in power, who said one thing to get elected then did something altogether different once in office.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Jacqui Lambie. Alex Douglas, a fellow PUP member, explained Lambie had \u201can ace up her sleeve\u201d because she came from Boganland. (Calling someone a bogan in Australia is akin to calling someone a redneck in America.) It wasn\u2019t meant as a compliment \u2013 he described bogans as \u201crejoicing in their own ignorance\u201d \u2013 but Douglas acknowledged the power they had in Australian politics. Bogans, he said, have \u201cinherited the earth and the world is full of them demanding their right, in an odd way, to be heard.\u201d Lambie quickly appropriated the insult: \u201cI will use the business contacts, advice and wisdom I\u2019ve gained \u2026 to help restore hope and rebuild our beautiful state \u2013 not bad for a bogan.\u2019\u2019\n\nPopulism may be politically powerful \u2013 the billionaire Palmer has certainly leveraged it to great effect \u2013 but as the PUP senators show, it is also difficult to control. During the carbon tax debate, Ricky Muir suddenly broke ranks, voting against the Coalition and PUP in order to allow debate to continue in the senate. And Lambie, who called the prime minister a \u201cpolitical psychopath,\u201d has also warned her loyalty to Palmer may not last forever. \u201cIf I don\u2019t agree with something, I\u2019ll stand up,\u201d she said after her election. \u201cI mean, Clive\u2019s a billionaire, I\u2019m the underdog \u2013 it\u2019s like chalk and cheese.\"", "article_metadata": {"zone": "nicole-hemmer/blogentries", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Australia's Populist Senators Bring the Tea Party Down Under", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Some populist senators are making Australian politics entirely unpredictable.", "title": "The Tea Party Down Under", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/nicole-hemmer/2014/07/22/australias-populist-senators-bring-the-tea-party-down-under", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/3c/39/c74ba3a94bf78445563194a93aeb/140722-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some populist senators are making Australian politics entirely unpredictable.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Australia's Populist Senators Bring the Tea Party Down Under"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "July 22, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Nicole Hemmer,Australia,politics,campaigns,populism,picks,Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Some populist senators are making Australian politics entirely unpredictable."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2a45\"", "article_summary": "But because the Coalition, Australia\u2019s governing party, failed to win an outright majority in the senate, PUP now holds the balance of power.\nThat\u2019s the PUP bloc of senators, which looks an awful lot like a microcosm of the tea party.\nFor all their flaws, the PUP senators signal the continuing power of populism in politics.\nWang won his seat after a missing-ballot scandal led to a statewide re-election, an event unprecedented in Australian politics.\nShe survived, and last September won a senate seat as a member of the Palmer United Party."}
