Is it better now?\u2019 Those are opportunities they will never have if they come down here to the police station.\u201d\n\nTolentino is one officer tasked with the responsibility of working at the Kaiser Permanente campus on Sereno Drive. Part of a recently renewed three-year grant from Kaiser to the Vallejo Neighborhood Policing Project, Tolentino is a presence at the hospital who not only handles anything needing a police officer to be present, but he also gives a kinder face to the Vallejo Police Department.\n\nOn a day of work at Kaiser, Tolentino can be seen greeting staff, helping patients in wheelchairs or giving directions to lost visitors. The effect of interactions like this with the public is not lost on Tolentino, and he views it as an important aspect of his job.\n\n\u201cKaiser is big on building a relationship with the community,\u201d Tolentino said of his role. \u201cThey don\u2019t want you there as Mr. Tactical Officer, but would rather that you build that relationship because that\u2019s always been their rule: \u2018Bridge that gap\u2019 and let the community hear that we\u2019re here to take care of them.\u201d\n\nCorwin Harper, senior vice president and area manager for Kaiser Permanente in the Napa-Solano area, said that Tolentino\u2019s presence adds a lot to the hospital and the community as a whole.\n\n\u201cWe get the whole gamut of activities at our hospital. We get people who come in to deliver their baby, we get people who have been shot and we get victims of other violent crimes,\u201d Harper said. \u201cSo the officer there does what officers do: provide a sense of peace and calm for the community in the hospital, but also it gives people a sense that we can have an effective relationship with police officers in our respective communities.\n\n\u201cAnd I think this creates a positive vibe for everybody that\u2019s on the campus and in the area,\u201d Harper added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs an officer, Tolentino knows that his presence is not always welcomed around Vallejo, but sees working at the hospital as a nice change.\n\n\u201cThe way (people) interact with me in the hospital, it\u2019s completely different than how they would act in the street.\u201d Tolentino said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like, out in the street, it\u2019s strictly business. \u2018Excuse me officer, can you help me with this?\u2019 No smile.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the hospital, you see that smile and I enjoy that. I let them know that (the police are) not here to just want to arrest people. I did not wake up this morning thinking that I\u2019m going to arrest someone, I\u2019m going to write this many speeding tickets... no. None of us feel that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very unique (to work at Kaiser),\u201d Tolentino continued. \u201cI really enjoy my responsibilities at Kaiser. I like what they do for the community and it makes the community safer, really.\u201d\n\nContact Dianne de Guzman at 707-553-6833.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trading the streets of Vallejo for the hallways of Kaiser Permanente, Vallejo police officer Ritzie Tolentino is doing community policing in his own way: Working with the staff at Kaiser and talking to the patients and families that wind up at the hos", "title": "Vallejo officer at Kaiser a welcome presence", "og": {"url": "http://www.timesheraldonline.com/article/NH/20150214/NEWS/150219901", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.timesheraldonline.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20150214/NEWS/150219901/AR/0/AR-150219901.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1050px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Vallejo officer at Kaiser a welcome presence"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timesheraldonline.com", "description": "Trading the streets of Vallejo for the hallways of Kaiser Permanente, Vallejo police officer Ritzie Tolentino is doing community policing in his own way: Working with the staff at Kaiser and talking to the patients and families that wind up at the hos", "title": "Vallejo officer at Kaiser a welcome presence", "url": "http://www.timesheraldonline.com/article/NH/20150214/NEWS/150219901", "image": {"src": "http://www.timesheraldonline.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/NH/20150214/NEWS/150219901/AR/0/AR-150219901.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@vjotimesherald", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id508801494", "iphone": "id419623006", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.vallejotimesherald"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "news, News", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "news, News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2bfe\"", "article_summary": "AdvertisementAs an officer, Tolentino knows that his presence is not always welcomed around Vallejo, but sees working at the hospital as a nice change.\nOn a day of work at Kaiser, Tolentino can be seen greeting staff, helping patients in wheelchairs or giving directions to lost visitors.\nNone of us feel that way.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very unique (to work at Kaiser),\u201d Tolentino continued.\nTrading the streets of Vallejo for the hallways of Kaiser Permanente, Vallejo police officer Ritzie Tolentino is doing community policing in his own way: Working with the staff at Kaiser and talking to the patients and families that wind up at the hospital.\n\u201cKaiser is big on building a relationship with the community,\u201d Tolentino said of his role."}
