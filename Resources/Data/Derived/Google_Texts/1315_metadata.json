The former first lady, senator and secretary of state is considered the front-runner among possible Democratic candidates.\"Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion -- so you can do more than just get by -- you can get ahead. And stay ahead,\" she said in her announcement video. \"Because when families are strong, America is strong. So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, because it's your time. And I hope you'll join me on this journey.\"\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich joined the Republican field July 21 as he formally announced his White House bid. \"I am here to ask you for your prayers, for your support ... because I have decided to run for president of the United States,\" Kasich told his kickoff rally at the Ohio State University.\n\nOhio Gov.

Ted Cruz of Texas has made a name for himself in the Senate, solidifying his brand as a conservative firebrand willing to take on the GOP's establishment. He announced he was seeking the Republican presidential nomination in a speech on March 23.\"These are all of our stories,\" Cruz told the audience at Liberty University in Virginia. \"These are who we are as Americans. And yet for so many Americans, the promise of America seems more and more distant.\"\n\nBusinessman Donald Trump announced June 16 at his Trump Tower in New York City that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination. This ends more than two decades of flirting with the idea of running for the White House.\"So, ladies and gentlemen, I am officially running for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again,\" Trump told the crowd at his announcement.\n\n\"Our health care is a horror show,\" said GOP candidate Donald Trump at the Republican debate in South Carolina Dec 15. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, winner of the Iowa caucuses, said at the debate in Des Moines Jan. 28 that the health law has been \"a disaster. It is the biggest job-killer in our country.\"\n\nDemocrats largely support the law, but even they can't agree on how to fix its problems. Hillary Clinton said at the Jan. 25 town hall on CNN that she wants to \"build on the ACA. Get costs down, but improve it, get to 100 percent coverage.\"\n\nClinton's rival for the nomination, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, acknowledged that \"the Affordable Care Act has done a lot of good things,\" but added that \"the United States today is the only major country on earth that doesn't guarantee health care to all people as a right.\" Sanders is pushing a government-run \"Medicare for All\" plan instead.\n\nIn some cases candidates are bending the truth. But in general, both praise and criticisms of the law are accurate. That's because the health law is so big and sweeping that it has had effects both positive and negative.\n\nHere is a brief guide to some things the health law has -- and has not -- accomplished since it was signed by President Barack Obama in 2010.\n\nCLAIM: The law has increased the number of people with health insurance coverage.\n\nThis is true, no matter what measure you use. The official Census Bureau and polling firm Gallup both found substantial drops in the percentage of people without health insurance after the majority of the law's coverage expansions took effect in 2014.\n\nCOUNTER-CLAIM: There are still millions of Americans who don't have insurance.\n\nThis is also true. Even though approximately 90 percent of Americans now have insurance, that remaining 10 percent amounts to more than 30 million people\n\nMillions aren't eligible for coverage under the law because they're not in the U.S. legally. Another 3 million are in the so-called \" Medicaid gap ,\" meaning they would be eligible for Medicaid under the ACA except their states opted not to accept the expansion after the Supreme Court effectively ruled the expansion optional.\n\nCLAIM: The ACA has fixed the dysfunctional individual insurance market.\n\nPrior to the passage of the health law, millions of people who did not have work-based or government coverage were shut out of buying their own insurance because they had been sick or because the coverage offered did not cover the services they needed.\n\nThe law aimed to address the problems in the individual market in several ways , including requiring insurers to sell to those with pre-existing conditions at the same price as healthier people; standardizing the benefits package; and limiting the size of deductibles. Tax credits were made available in order to help people afford coverage. And the law created insurance exchanges intended to help consumers compare, choose, sign up and pay for health insurance.\n\nHow well these changes succeeded in stabilizing the market is not yet clear. What is clear is that more people are now insured through the market.\n\nCOUNTER-CLAIM: The ACA has made the individual market worse.\n\nAll is not well in the reformed individual market.\n\nEven with help paying premiums, many moderate-income Americans are finding that their deductibles and copayments are so high they cannot afford to use their insurance\n\nCLAIM: The ACA has improved the Medicare program.\n\nWhile most of the law was aimed at those without insurance, lawmakers also took the opportunity to beef up some benefits for the 55 million Americans in the Medicare program. Medicare enrollees got new coverage for preventive services and annual checkups, and those with high prescription drug expenses got help to fill the \" doughnut hole \" gap left by the 2003 Medicare drug program.\n\nOver the longer term, the law created several payment experiments intended to improve the quality of care Medicare patients receive and lower costs. These include efforts to prevent patients from going back to the hospital after they've been discharged.\n\nCOUNTER-CLAIM: The ACA has not saved money for Medicare.\n\nThe rate of increase in Medicare spending has slowed since the health law was passed in 2010. But it's not clear how much of that can be attributed to the law, aside from some provisions that actually cut payments to hospitals and other health providers.\n\nAnd some of the most highly anticipated projects, including \" accountable care organizations \" that are paid bonuses for keeping Medicare patients healthy and lowering spending, have not so far shown very good results.\n\nCLAIM: The ACA has killed jobs.\n\nAn analysis in 2015 by the Urban Institute found that the health law \"had virtually no adverse effect on labor force participation; employment; the probability of part-time work; and hours worked per week by nonelderly adults.\"\n\nWhile there would be fewer people in the workforce due to the law, the Congressional Budget Office found in 2014 that \"almost entirely\" stems from voluntary actions by workers who could quit because they no longer depended on their jobs for insurance -- now they could buy it on their own.\n\nCLAIM: The ACA has slowed overall health spending.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nearly 6 years after its enactment, the Affordable Care Act remains a hot button issue in the presidential race -- in both parties.", "pubdate": "2016-02-05T10:20:00Z", "author": "Julie Rovner, Kaiser Health News", "og": {"site_name": "CNN", "description": "Nearly 6 years after its enactment, the Affordable Care Act remains a hot button issue in the presidential race -- in both parties.", "pubdate": "2016-02-05T10:20:00Z", "title": "Fact-checking the candidates on the Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/05/health/voters-guide-affordable-care-act/index.html", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150625102256-obamacare-large-169.jpg", "type": "article"}, "section": "health", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/05/health/voters-guide-affordable-care-act/index.html"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "template-top": "health,art-vid", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}, "keywords": "health, Fact-checking the candidates on the Affordable Care Act - CNN.com", "lastmod": "2016-02-05T10:20:00Z", "thumbnail": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150625102256-obamacare-large-169.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Nearly 6 years after its enactment, the Affordable Care Act remains a hot button issue in the presidential race -- in both parties.\n\"Our health care is a horror show,\" said GOP candidate Donald Trump at the Republican debate in South Carolina Dec 15.\nThat's because the health law is so big and sweeping that it has had effects both positive and negative.\nAnd the law created insurance exchanges intended to help consumers compare, choose, sign up and pay for health insurance.\nOver the longer term, the law created several payment experiments intended to improve the quality of care Medicare patients receive and lower costs."}
