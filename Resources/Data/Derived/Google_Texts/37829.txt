After multiple delays, Wal-Mart will break ground June 2 on a store in Shepherdsville — its first in Bullitt County.

The 180,000-square-foot Supercenter will include groceries, general merchandise and a fuel station, Wal-Mart spokesman Erica Jones said. It should open next spring.

It will be built across from Shepherdsville City Hall on Conestoga Parkway.

Last summer, Shepherdsville and Bullitt County officials rezoned the store’s 25-acre property from general industrial and light industrial to B-1 Highway Business.

In July, Shepherdsville Mayor Scott Ellis said paperwork required for various state permits delayed construction, but the store could open as soon as fall 2014.

Additional permits needed to build the fuel station further delayed the project, Ellis recently said, but the construction is finally ready to begin.

“We’ve been working on this thing for about two and a half years, maybe a little bit longer,” Ellis said, noting that Wal-Mart looked at multiple locations before settling on Conestoga Parkway, visible from Interstate 65.

Designs for the building went through the Bullitt County code enforcement department but were not required to be voted on by any city or county commission, Ellis said.

Ellis said Wal-Mart will provide Bullitt County residents a closer grocery shopping option instead of having to drive to the nearest Louisville location, located just outside the county’s boundaries on Preston Highway, north of Hillview.

“Anything we can do to keep people from leaving Shepherdsville and Bullitt County,” Ellis said.

The store will also create new jobs for the company, Jones said, though the number is unclear.
