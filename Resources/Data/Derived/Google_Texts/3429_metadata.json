(Yes, people have period sex.) There are the obviously wrong ideas, like every woman\u2019s cycle lasts the same amount of time (it doesn\u2019t), and a heavy flow indicates menorrhagia (very few women experience this abnormal level of bleeding).\n\nSome ideas, however, are not as easy to disprove. In which case, we poked around the Internet for the wildly perpetuated ideas regarding a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle and ran them by Dr. Carolyn Dean, on the medical advisory board for the Nutritional Magnesium Association.\n\nMyth: Swimming In The Ocean On Your Period Attracts Sharks\n\nEven if Dean wasn\u2019t a doctor specializing in women\u2019s health, she lives in Maui; she knows about sharks. \u201cSharks don\u2019t just swim around looking for victims,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can sense body fluid and blood from distances, but they\u2019re looking for dead fish. It\u2019s possible they sense blood, but they don\u2019t attack. To say you shouldn\u2019t go swimming because you have your period is really ridiculous.\u201d\n\nMyth: Hot Water Increases Period Flow\n\nHot water (and heat in general) does not affect flow, making it lighter or heavier, but it will increase your circulation, Dean said. Improved circulation benefits women suffering from cramps. For when cramps are especially bad, Dean recommends warm, Epsom salt baths.\n\nMyth: You Can\u2019t Get Pregnant On Your Period\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a mistake; It can happen,\u201d Dean said. \u201cThere are other things that can trigger hormones to trigger ovulation.\u201d\n\nFor example, Dean said sperm can survive 48 hours after the fact. So if women have sex in the days after their period ends, they may not be safe from pregnancy. The only way you can tell is if you conduct the standard ovulation method, which is to check mucus and temperature. Dean said mucus indicates acceptance of sperm, and temperature indicates ovulation.\n\nMyth: Avoid Exercise\n\nExercise, like hot water, actually benefits period cramps, producing chemicals that block pain. Dean said exercise can be particularly helpful for people who otherwise enjoy it.\n\nAccording to Everyday Health, the only time women on their period should avoid exercise if they\u2019re experiencing severe cramping (dysmenorrhea) or menorrhagia.\n\nMyth: Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) Is Not Real\n\nAs soon as we ask this question, Dean laughs. \u201cWe don\u2019t want it to be real, but mineral deficiencies and a hormonal imbalance causes what we know as PMS,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not psychological, it\u2019s physiological.\u201d PMS symptoms vary among women, but they generally include breast tenderness, bloating, fatigue, irritability, and mood swings.\n\nTo help, Dean encourages her patients to take magnesium supplements in the weeks leading up to their period. The University of Maryland Medical Center agrees, reporting 360 milligrams of magnesium daily for three days on the day before menstruation starts reduces cramps and menstrual pain.\n\nMyth: Women Don\u2019t Need Their Period\n\nThere is a market for oral contraceptives that prevent ovulation, which means women only get their period a certain amount of times a year versus every month. An example is a drug called Seasonale, and while women still have to take a pill every day, their period will only occur every 12 weeks. \u201cI think that\u2019s horrendous, and it could contribute to infertility,\u201d Dean said.\n\nWomen who eventually hope to get pregnant want their period, as annoying as the cramps and incessant chocolate cravings are. An irregular cycle (and hormones) can make it harder to conceive, possibly leading to additional fertility drugs and their respective side effects.\n\nAre there any other ideas and myths you were hoping we\u2019d address about menstrual cycles?
