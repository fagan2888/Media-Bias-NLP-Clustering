The store also could showcase products sold at the Sioux City Farmers Market, which is held twice weekly during the spring, summer and fall near the Tyson Events Center.\n\nThe business group, Downtown Partners, hasn\u2019t announced a budget or a timetable. Chris Bogenrief leads the Downtown Partners committee organizing the project, and he says the project \u201cis an economic initiative, so we want to make sure we spur as much spinoff development as we can.\u201d\n\nThe group plans to hire a consultant to help analyze the administrative costs and projected revenues for the store. They have identified three possible sites for the project. Bogenrief said the goal is to buy a historic building and use tax credits to help pay for development.\n\nOne farmer who sells produce and meat at the Sioux City Famers Market said he would welcome a downtown store to showcase his goods.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d most definitely be interested in something like that,\u201d said Jay Wolff, of Norfolk, Neb.-based Wolff Farms. \u201cBusiness slows down a lot in the winter time, but we still have produce to sell.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Sioux City Journal, http://www.siouxcityjournal.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A business group is exploring the idea of opening a specialty grocery store in downtown Sioux City, according to a Friday report in the Sioux City Journal.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A business group is exploring the idea of opening a specialty grocery store in downtown Sioux City, according to a Friday report in the Sioux City Journal.", "title": "Downtown Sioux City group eyes grocery store idea", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/28/downtown-sioux-city-group-eyes-grocery-store-idea/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/28/329b669cc49fbc2e660f6a706700dbba.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/28/329b669cc49fbc2e660f6a706700dbba.jpg", "description": "A business group is exploring the idea of opening a specialty grocery store in downtown Sioux City, according to a Friday report in the Sioux City Journal.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Downtown Sioux City group eyes grocery store idea"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b75\"", "article_summary": "SIOUX CITY, Iowa (AP) - A business group is exploring the idea of opening a specialty grocery store in downtown Sioux City, according to a Friday report in the Sioux City Journal.\nThe business group, Downtown Partners, hasn\u2019t announced a budget or a timetable.\nOne farmer who sells produce and meat at the Sioux City Famers Market said he would welcome a downtown store to showcase his goods.\n\u201cBusiness slows down a lot in the winter time, but we still have produce to sell.\u201d___Information from: Sioux City Journal, http://www.siouxcityjournal.com\nThe store also could showcase products sold at the Sioux City Farmers Market, which is held twice weekly during the spring, summer and fall near the Tyson Events Center."}
