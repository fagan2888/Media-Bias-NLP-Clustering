A 6-year-old's desire to help children who are less fortunate has continued to grow.

Now in its second year, the Great Toy Take Away was held in Greenville at the National Guard Armory Saturday morning.

Bailey Bliven and her family had the first gave away toys in 2014 when the family cleaned out Bailey's toy room. "Mama was talking about all these people that didn't have toys for Christmas so I said I want to give toys to people who don't get Christmas," Bailey said.

The Bliven family says 2,000 toys were given away last year, but this year they gave away as many as 10,000 toys. The toys are new or gently used and donated by the public.
