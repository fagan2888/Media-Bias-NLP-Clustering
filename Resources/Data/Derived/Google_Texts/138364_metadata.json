But the Met notified Salsi on Saturday morning he wouldn\u2019t be needed.\n\nThen Domingo arrived at the house and felt he couldn\u2019t go on.\n\nSalsi had last sung the role in Rome in December 2013 with conductor Riccardo Muti.\n\n\u201cWhen you do something with maestro Muti, after you will remember very well the score,\u201d Salsi said.\n\nDomingo stood in the wings during the performance to encourage him. Salsi had never been on the set before.\n\n\u201cI had to improvise everything,\u201d he said.\n\nHe smiled widely during the curtain calls as flowers were thrown from the audience at the cast, which also included Francesco Meli in the title role, Angela Meade as Elvira and Dmitry Belosselskiy as Don Ruy Gomez de Silva.\n\nFearful his energy would dissipate before the evening performance, Salsi walked near the Met for a bit. Then he returned and changed into his Enrico costume.\n\nBy the time \u201cLucia\u201d ended just after 11 p.m., he still felt charged with adrenaline.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a singer, this is a crazy thing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Luca Salsi was at the corner of Broadway and 72nd Street, taking a walk with his wife, when he got a call from Alvaro Domingo, son of the famous singer.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Luca Salsi was at the corner of Broadway and 72nd Street, taking a walk with his wife, when he got a call from Alvaro Domingo, son of the famous singer.", "title": "With Placido Domingo ill, Luca Salsi sings Met doubleheader", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/5/with-placido-domingo-ill-luca-salsi-sings-met-doub/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/05/92a9163e4e86d50f720f6a70670016d7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/04/05/92a9163e4e86d50f720f6a70670016d7.jpg", "description": "Luca Salsi was at the corner of Broadway and 72nd Street, taking a walk with his wife, when he got a call from Alvaro Domingo, son of the famous singer.", "card": "summary", "title": "With Placido Domingo ill, Luca Salsi sings Met doubleheader"}, "Author": "RONALD BLUM", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Fearful his energy would dissipate before the evening performance, Salsi walked near the Met for a bit.\n\u201cJust go and sing.\u201dMet general manager Peter Gelb had called Salsi on Friday night, saying Domingo was fighting a cold.\nBut the Met notified Salsi on Saturday morning he wouldn\u2019t be needed.\nSalsi had 30 minutes to make the nine-block trip to the Metropolitan Opera, get in costume and replace Placido Domingo as Don Carlo in Saturday\u2019s performance of Verdi\u2019s \u201cErnani,\u201d which was broadcast on radio around the world.\nSalsi had last sung the role in Rome in December 2013 with conductor Riccardo Muti."}
