A marching band from Townview Magnet Center performed, a choir from St. Mark\u2019s School of Texas sang and actors dressed as colorful frogs and bugs wandered through the crowd.\n\nDallas Mayor Mike Rawlings declared Saturday \u201cRory Meyers Children\u2019s Adventure Day\u201d with a proclamation and commended donors for supporting the garden despite a difficult economy.\n\nIn a speech, Howard Meyers said naming the garden after his wife, Rory, was a fitting gift because she has long championed children\u2019s education and health. When he saw a model of the children\u2019s garden, he told the Dallas Arboretum\u2019s president that he was interested in funding it.\n\n\u201cThis was something in her heart and that\u2019s why we did it,\u201d Meyers said after the dedication ceremony. Now, he said he looks forward seeing his granddaughter and all of Dallas\u2019 children learn and play there.\n\nIn a surprise announcement, the Meyers family received a gift of their own. A friend announced the creation of the Rory Meyers Angel Fund. The endowment will cover the cost of travel and admission for low-income families.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDEzLzA5L2RhbGxhcy1hcmJvcmV0dW0tY3V0cy1yaWJib24tb3BlbnMtcm9yeS1tZXllcnMtY2hpbGRyZW4tYWR2ZW50dXJlLWdhcmRlbi5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Melissa Repko", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "The Dallas Arboretum opened its newest attraction Saturday afternoon at a ribbon-cutting for the Rory Meyers Children's Adventure Garden.
