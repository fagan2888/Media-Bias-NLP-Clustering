(AP) \u2014 A white lawmaker says he gave watermelons to people in his central Mississippi House district, and his black challenger says doing so promoted racial stereotypes.\n\nFirst-term Democratic Rep. Brad Oberhousen of Byram told The Clarion-Ledger that he gave the melons to several people for their Fourth of July gatherings.\n\nOberhousen says he has given away fresh produce for years. He says his supporters are black and white, and they don\u2019t view his melons as having any racial connotations.\n\nHis opponent in the Aug. 4 Democratic primary, Jarvis Dortch of Jackson, says he has spoken to voters who felt insulted that Oberhousen posted Facebook photos of himself giving watermelons to black people. Dortch says Oberhousen has deleted the photos.\n\nOberhousen and Dortch, who are both attorneys, are running in a majority-black district.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Clarion-Ledger, http://www.clarionledger.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "A white lawmaker says he gave watermelons to people in his central Mississippi House district, and his black challenger says doing so promoted racial stereotypes.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A white lawmaker says he gave watermelons to people in his central Mississippi House district, and his black challenger says doing so promoted racial stereotypes.", "title": "Mississippi lawmaker\u2019s watermelon giveaway was racist, challenger says", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/22/challenger-slams-lawmakers-watermelon-giveaway-to-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/31/affa66cbd0100d2a640f6a706700a6f9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/10/31/affa66cbd0100d2a640f6a706700a6f9.jpg", "description": "A white lawmaker says he gave watermelons to people in his central Mississippi House district, and his black challenger says doing so promoted racial stereotypes.", "card": "summary", "title": "Mississippi lawmaker\u2019s watermelon giveaway was racist, challenge"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Brad Oberhousen, Clarion, Jackson"}, "article_summary": "(AP) \u2014 A white lawmaker says he gave watermelons to people in his central Mississippi House district, and his black challenger says doing so promoted racial stereotypes.\nHe says his supporters are black and white, and they don\u2019t view his melons as having any racial connotations.\nFirst-term Democratic Rep.
