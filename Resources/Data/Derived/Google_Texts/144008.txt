Shortly after it was revealed that Jonathan Gruber was going around telling people that the Affordable Care Act had to be packaged and sold with the stupidity of the American voter in mind, the president referred to him as "some adviser who never worked on our staff.”

Turns out, he was quite a bit more than that.

As Mark Hensch of the The Hill reports, Gruber:

had a bigger impact on the healthcare law than previously known, The Wall Street Journal is reporting … [and] frequently contacted Obama administration officials via email while crafting ObamaCare

This comes as the Supreme Court prepares to hand down a decision that may be life or death for Obamacare, which is by far the bigger story. Still, it does speak to the credibility of the Obama administration and the President, who insisted that Gruber was just some guy. As Mark Halperin said on the Morning Joe program:

“I owe my Republican sources an apology, because they kept telling me he was hugely involved and the White House played it down. They were right. The Republicans were right … I think the [White House] was not fully forthcoming.”

Trusting, all the while, in the gullibility of the American media.
