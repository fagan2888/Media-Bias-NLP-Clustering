Sign up here for email updates from Capital & Main.\n\nEvery year Los Angeles\u2019 Cedars-Sinai Medical Center releases a glossy brochure called Report to the Community. Among the doctor profiles and research-breakthrough stories are several dry metrics dealing with the number of beds, total patient and outpatient days and, perhaps most impressively, the year\u2019s dollar value for something called \u201ccommunity benefit contributions.\u201d\n\nCedars, which is the state\u2019s third highest-earning nonprofit hospital, claimed $640.3 million as its 2012 community benefit contribution.\n\nThis number turns out to be the real point of the report. Because under state law all not-for-profit hospitals must justify their continuing tax exemption as charitable institutions by demonstrating that they are providing a community benefit \u2014 free charity care to indigent patients and what California calls \u201cactivities that are intended to address community needs and priorities primarily through disease prevention and improvement of health status.\u201d\n\nWhether Cedars and California\u2019s other nonprofit hospitals have been living up to that charitable obligation is a question that Assembly Bill 503, currently under consideration in Sacramento, seeks to clarify.\n\nIt\u2019s no trifling matter. In 2010 taxpayers spent an estimated $3.3 billion granting exemptions for the state\u2019s nonprofit hospital industry, according to a 2012 report released by the Institute for Health and Socio-Economic Policy, the research arm of the California Nurses Association (CNA), which is also a financial supporter of Capital & Main.\n\nThe CNA study places Cedars at the top of its statewide list for hospitals receiving the most in tax exemptions beyond what they offer in actual charity care. For 2010, CNA calculated the value of Cedar\u2019s charity care at only $16,123,766 and its tax exemptions in excess of charity care at $104,327,297. Industry-wide, the study said, the exemptions in excess of actual care totaled $1.8 billion.\n\nAB 503 was introduced by Assemblymembers Bob Wieckowski (D-Fremont) and Rob Bonta (D-Oakland), and co-sponsored by the CNA, the Greenlining Institute and California Rural Legal Assistance (CRLA).\n\nThe legislation, its authors say, is an attempt to bring California\u2019s community benefit law into line with federal rules, as well as to add what they maintain is a much needed level of transparency to the sometimes sketchy methodologies and liberal accounting practices tolerated under the current law.\n\n\u201cWhat happens,\u201d Wieckowski told Capital & Main, \u201cis that each of these nonprofit hospitals now sets their own valuation of what they think is their community benefit or their charity care. And they all use a different accounting of what they believe is the contribution. And the audits that have been done and the reviews have been saying, \u2018Well, wait a minute. We should have some standardized [methodologies].\u2019 If you give a vaccination to school kids, that vaccination within limits shouldn\u2019t be $100 in San Diego and $10 in Sacramento, depending on the nonprofit hospital, right?\u201d\n\nAccording to Medicare cost reports, as of June, 2013, California hospitals rank third nationally in how high they set their charges over cost, on average billing $451 for every $100 of costs. Between 2006-2008 alone, the practice resulted in class action price-gouging settlements that returned nearly $1 billion to patients.\n\nThe difference paid by Medi-Cal and Medicare on the one hand, and, on the other, the much higher and often arbitrary and convoluted prices set by hospital chargemasters that are currently written off as charity care, is known as a public program shortfall. According to a report issued last year\n\nby the Greenlining Institute titled Not-for-Profit Hospitals and Community Benefit, as well as a 2013 study in the New England Journal of Medicine, this shortfall is the top community benefit expenditure reported by hospitals.\n\nAmong other reforms, AB 503 will bring California into accord with the federal tax code, which disallows such shortfalls or accounts written off as bad debt to be classified as charity care.\n\n\u201cIt basically tries to establish some standardized methodology for estimating what the economic value of community benefits are to a community,\u201d says Wieckowski.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s hospital industry sees the bill differently. \u201cThere already is transparency,\u201d insists California Hospital Association (CHA) spokesperson Jan Emerson about the present law. \u201cThe bill is completely unnecessary and is a rerun of a piece of legislation that was soundly defeated a year ago in the state Assembly \u2014 AB 975.\u201d\n\nCalifornia\u2019s existing community benefit law was sponsored by CHA and the California Association of Catholic Hospitals in 1994 after a federal appeals court ruled that a Pennsylvania not-for-profit didn\u2019t qualify for tax exempt status because it failed the federal tax code\u2019s community benefit test.\n\nBut by excluding standardized definitions for either charity care or community benefit, and prohibiting the consideration of the dollar value of a nonprofit hospital\u2019s community benefit plan when evaluating its tax-exempt status, the California law also gave the state\u2019s nonprofit hospitals wide latitude in formulating their community benefit plans \u2013 and deciding what constitutes a community benefit in the first place.\n\nUnder present law, even the costs for producing Cedar\u2019s slick promotional reports could be charged off by the hospital as community benefit. The problem, say advocates, is that reporting is so murky that it\u2019s usually impossible to tell what is being written off.\n\n\u201cWhen we actually looked at what hospitals were defining as community benefit, it was very unclear,\u201d says Carla Saporta, a co-author of the Greenlining community benefit study. \u201cIt\u2019s just a black box. There isn\u2019t a lot of transparency to what the hospitals are doing.\u201d\n\nAt a time of noose-tight budgets that disproportionately impact low-income populations already prone to preventable conditions such as obesity, coronary heart disease, diabetes and lung cancer, underutilized community benefit dollars are increasingly being eyed as a public health resource that could patch California\u2019s badly frayed public-health safety net.\n\n\u201cWe would welcome more,\u201d says Noe Paramo, a CRLA legislative advocate who specializes in health policy for the San Joaquin Valley\u2019s farm worker communities, which were left out in the cold by both the Affordable Care Act and Covered California. According to CRLA estimates, 353,000 people \u2014 about nine percent of the eight Central Valley counties\u2019 population \u2013 will either be denied health coverage or be unable to afford it. At the same time, Paramo says, these counties have been cutting funding for their indigent patient programs, with the exception of emergency care.\n\nAB 503 is scheduled to come up before the Senate Health Committee June 25. Wieckowski is optimistic about its chances.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made some changes [from AB 975]\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve narrowed the scope of the bill.\n\nNevertheless, the legislation will give the state, for the first time, a standard definition of charity care, as a direct provision of care rather than the promotional activities, marketing or cost containment that frequently go into the ledger as \u201ccommunity benefit.\u201d\n\nThe bill will also require nonprofit hospitals to allocate a minimum of 25 percent of their community benefit budget to public health programming and ensure that the majority of any dollars spent on community benefits go to the state\u2019s most vulnerable populations.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to do is highlight that we give special status to this group of hospitals versus the other hospitals,\u201d Wieckowski says. \u201cAnd what we expect in return is that our local communities know what\u2019s going on [to] determine if we are getting value for the tax benefit we are conferring to them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The following story was r...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2014-06-17 13:44:29 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The following story was r...", "title": "'Community Benefits' A Windfall For Some Nonprofit Hospitals", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/16/nonprofit-hospital-benefi_n_5500190.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1857394/images/o-CEDARS-SINAI-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1857394/images/o-CEDARS-SINAI-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "description": "The following story was r...", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'Community Benefits' A Windfall For Some Nonprofit Hospitals"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-16 13:44:29 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=5500190", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "nonprofit hospitals,hospitals,Cedars Sinai,california hospitals,nonprofit hospital benefits", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "nonprofit hospitals,hospitals,Cedars Sinai,california hospitals,nonprofit hospital benefits", "published_time": "2014-06-16 13:44:29 -0400", "modified_time": "2014-06-16 14:59:02 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbcda\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWhen we actually looked at what hospitals were defining as community benefit, it was very unclear,\u201d says Carla Saporta, a co-author of the Greenlining community benefit study.\nAccording to a report issued last yearby the Greenlining Institute titled Not-for-Profit Hospitals and Community Benefit, as well as a 2013 study in the New England Journal of Medicine, this shortfall is the top community benefit expenditure reported by hospitals.\nBut by excluding standardized definitions for either charity care or community benefit, and prohibiting the consideration of the dollar value of a nonprofit hospital\u2019s community benefit plan when evaluating its tax-exempt status, the California law also gave the state\u2019s nonprofit hospitals wide latitude in formulating their community benefit plans \u2013 and deciding what constitutes a community benefit in the first place.\nFor 2010, CNA calculated the value of Cedar\u2019s charity care at only $16,123,766 and its tax exemptions in excess of charity care at $104,327,297.\nUnder present law, even the costs for producing Cedar\u2019s slick promotional reports could be charged off by the hospital as community benefit."}
