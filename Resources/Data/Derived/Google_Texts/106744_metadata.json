And in most states, Americans using Obamacare\u2019s individual marketplace to purchase insurance saw premium costs rise by double digits.\n\nFreedom Partners, a nonprofit organization advocating free markets and limited government, reported that four states\u2014Minnesota, Alaska, Tennessee, and Hawaii\u2014will be hit with average premium increases of 30 percent or more. Another 17 states will see spikes of at least 20 percent.\n\nNathan Nascimento, the group\u2019s senior policy adviser, said a \u201csicker risk pool\u201d coupled with Obamacare\u2019s \u201conerous and crushing mandates\u201d caused the across-the-board hikes.\n\n\u201cIn many states, insurers are finding increased costs and burdensome mandates under the law to be unsustainable, and are exiting the marketplace altogether,\u201d Nascimento told The Daily Signal, adding:\n\nOthers are facing a variety of harmful side effects of Obamacare, with young, healthy people opting out of coverage or finding their plans unaffordable and dropping out before the end of the year.\n\nThis state-by-state chart summarizes the group\u2019s findings:\n\nAmericans living in Minnesota will be hurt the most, with premium costs expected to skyrocket nearly 48 percent, Freedom Partners\u2019 \u201c2016 Obamacare Premium Increase Tracker\u201d found.\n\nAlaska faces increases around 39 percent, Tennessee around 35 percent, and Hawaii around 30 percent.\n\nThe only state where premiums are expected to fall is Mississippi. Those who reside in the Magnolia State can expect a 0.2-percent drop.\n\nDrew Gonshorowski, a senior policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation who tracks premium increases under Obamacare, said costs also may be rising because insurance companies initially priced their plans too low.\n\n\u201cEvery year, historically, premiums have gone up a decent amount,\u201d Gonshorowski told The Daily Signal. \u201cBut in these cases, a lot of this has to do with some insurers coming into the market a little lower than what they had thought was reasonable and now they\u2019re trying to recoup losses.\u201d\n\nHe also attributed the premium increases to individuals who enrolled in the insurance exchanges while less healthy than insurers predicted.\n\n\u201cThere is some evidence that utilization is up from this population, and if people use their health insurance more, or use their health providers more, it costs the insurers more,\u201d Gonshorowski said.\n\nIt also causes insurance companies to pay out more than anticipated, he said, so they have to raise premiums to compensate for the losses.\n\nThe biggest issue with the Affordable Care Act, he said, is that the law puts restrictions on how insurers can price plans in the market.\n\n\u201cA repeal of the ACA would take away these restrictions,\u201d Gonshorowski said. \u201cThey would allow insurers to price more flexibly and actually price to the cost of their enrollees. The evidence shows that that would bring premiums down.\u201d\n\nNascimento said that although repealing the health care law would \u201celiminate the excessive mandates and regulations\u201d spurring premium increases, a repeal alone would not be enough to fix the health care system:\n\nWe need to see further free-market reforms to truly lower costs for all Americans. Broadly, we need to get government regulations out of the way and truly reform how health care is delivered by eliminating barriers to care and unshackling providers.\n\nBut it isn\u2019t just premiums that are increasing. Gonshorowski said that based on his own research with Heritage, the cost of deductibles also is rising.\n\nHe said the best thing Americans who are facing more expensive health care costs can do is shop around on the marketplace to look for cheaper options.\n\n\u201cIt really does seem like the plans that captured market share are interested in increasing prices for people,\u201d the Heritage policy analyst said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health insurance premiums under Obamacare are expected to fall this year in only one state.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Health insurance premiums under Obamacare are expected to fall this year in only one state.", "title": "Find Out How Much Obamacare Rates Increased in Your State", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160115_ACAPremiums_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-18T14:19:04+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/205f2CP"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Health insurance premiums under Obamacare are expected to fall this year in only one state.", "title": "Find Out How Much Obamacare Rates Increased in Your State", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160115_ACAPremiums_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2016-01-15T16:50:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-18T14:19:04+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, ACA, health insurance, health insurance premiums, Freedom Partners, health care marketplace, insurance increase, health costs"}, "article_summary": "All states, with the exception of Mississippi, saw the cost of health insurance premiums increase for 2016.\nHe said the best thing Americans who are facing more expensive health care costs can do is shop around on the marketplace to look for cheaper options.\nPremiums under the Affordable Care Act will rise in nearly every state this year, spiking health insurance costs for nearly all Americans, according to a new report.\nAnd in most states, Americans using Obamacare\u2019s individual marketplace to purchase insurance saw premium costs rise by double digits.\nThis state-by-state chart summarizes the group\u2019s findings:Americans living in Minnesota will be hurt the most, with premium costs expected to skyrocket nearly 48 percent, Freedom Partners\u2019 \u201c2016 Obamacare Premium Increase Tracker\u201d found."}
