WASHINGTON — A super PAC supporting Sen. Ted Cruz released a third ad in a week attacking front-runner Donald Trump’s health care plan, calling it “Trumpcare.”

The 30-second spot from Keep the Promise 1 uses a clip from an interview Trump did with 60 Minutes in September, discussing his plans for Obamacare and how to keep Americans insured. The ad paints Trump’s plan for government-funded, universal health care as a renamed version of Obamacare.

“Everybody has to be covered. This is an un-Republican thing for me to say,” Trump says. “I am going to take care of everybody … The government’s gonna pay for it.”

The ad snipped Trump’s explanation that he could strike a deal to make it work.

“They’re going to be taken care of. I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of [uninsured] people,” Trump said. “The government’s gonna pay for it. But we’re going to save so much money on the other side. But for the most it’s going to be a private plan and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything.”

The super PAC is also running ads targeting Trump for calling himself “pro-choice” on all aspects of abortion in 1999, and for praising Cruz at a February 2014 fundraiser in Florida. All three ads are part of a $2.5 million ad buy, running in Iowa and South Carolina until caucus and primary voting begins.
