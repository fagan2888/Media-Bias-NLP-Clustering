Picture: Picture Campbell Brodie.\n\nTEXTING, tweeting and talking \u2014 it can all be done on the mobile phone, but don\u2019t do it while crossing the road.\n\nPolice are fining wayward pedestrians who are putting themselves and other road users in danger because they can\u2019t take their eyes off their mobile phones or are listening to music.\n\nAnd one road safety expert has called for tougher penalties and a crackdown on people walking, talking and texting saying pedestrians have become \u201cdisconnected from their brains\u201d.\n\nUnder the Road Traffic Act a person \u201cmust not walk without due care or attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road\u201d or face a $105 fine.\n\nSA Police fined and cautioned 62 people in the 18 months to July this year for breaking the law.\n\nBut Pedestrian Council chairman Harold Scruby said walking while using a mobile phone was dangerous and called for increased enforcement and penalties.\n\nMr Scruby said the cost of medical assistance for a pedestrian involved in a crash was double that of someone inside a motor vehicle, totalling $20 million for lifetime care.\n\n\u201cThis is a new phenomenon like an epidemic. It\u2019s out of control and it\u2019s costly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSometimes up to one in three people crossing the road is using some kind of mobile device.\n\n\u201cThey are disconnected from their brains. It\u2019s not just them at risk but other people too.\u201d\n\nThe Sunday Mail observed dozens of pedestrians walking across King William St at the intersection of Hindley St and Rundle Mall in a 30-minute period on Wednesday lunchtime.\n\nNone of the people spoken to by the Sunday Mail were aware of the $105 fine they may have received and some were even unperturbed.\n\nSeveral people said they knew what they were doing was potentially dangerous while others said they would stop doing it upon learning of the penalty.\n\nTraffic Support Branch Superintendent Bob Fauser said pedestrians needed to use the road with care and be respectful of other people\u2019s rights.\n\n\u201cRegardless of any lawful rights or obligations, pedestrians must understand that they will always come off second best when they are involved in a collision with a motor vehicle,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTherefore, even if you have right of way, make sure that other road users are doing the right thing before walking on to the road.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "TEXTING, tweeting and talking \u2014 it can all be done on the mobile phone, but dont do it while crossing the road.", "generator": "tcog", "og": {"url": "http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/pedestrians-distracted-by-their-mobile-phones-face-105-fine/news-story/917dc4f1f10bae51835a7fc47706949b", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/357051c2b18ea68eca5a920824aebad6", "type": "article", "description": "TEXTING, tweeting and talking \u2014 it can all be done on the mobile phone, but don\u2019t do it while crossing the road.", "title": "Get off the phone, watch where you\u2019re going"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/357051c2b18ea68eca5a920824aebad6", "title": "Get off the phone, watch where you\u2019re going", "description": "TEXTING, tweeting and talking \u2014 it can all be done on the mobile phone, but don\u2019t do it while crossing the road.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@theTiser"}, "robots": "noarchive", "vr": {"canonical": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/link/917dc4f1f10bae51835a7fc47706949b?domain=adelaidenow.com.au"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "articleid": "917dc4f1f10bae51835a7fc47706949b", "keywords": "mobile phone, Picture Campbell Brodie, mobile phones, motor vehicle, road users, POLICE REPORTER, due care, mobile device, medical assistance, lifetime care, reasonable consideration, people walking, city risk, Support Branch, Bob Fauser, STEVE", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-06T11:30:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2014-09-06T10:35:39.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd00d6\"", "article_summary": "Police are fining wayward pedestrians who are putting themselves and other road users in danger because they can\u2019t take their eyes off their mobile phones or are listening to music.\nThe Pedestrian Council wants police to crackdown on people talking and texting on their mobile phones.\n\u201cTherefore, even if you have right of way, make sure that other road users are doing the right thing before walking on to the road.\u201d\nTEXTING, tweeting and talking \u2014 it can all be done on the mobile phone, but don\u2019t do it while crossing the road.\nUnder the Road Traffic Act a person \u201cmust not walk without due care or attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons using the road\u201d or face a $105 fine."}
