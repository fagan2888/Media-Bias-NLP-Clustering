He also delayed Reynolds' trial on misdemeanor tax charges until June 20.\n\nReynolds was arrested for violating the terms of his bond Monday when he arrived at an Atlanta airport after spending more than a month in South Africa, where he said he was caring for his daughter, Marisol, a college student.\n\nDuring a brief hearing Wednesday, prosecutors said Reynolds' 23-year-old daughter posted social media updates from Berlin in February, when he was supposed to be taking care of her in Africa, according to Joseph Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago. His daughter also posted about doing squats, an exercise which could be difficult for a person suffering from a serious limitation, prosecutors said.\n\nReynolds, 64, says his daughter may need surgery for scoliosis. But prosecutors argued her social media posts bring into question the validity of the illness.\n\nReynolds has been allowed to travel to Africa twice since he pleaded not guilty last year to four counts of failing to file a tax return. But he's also clashed with court officials several times as he awaits trial.\n\nA Harvard graduate and a Rhodes Scholar, Reynolds resigned from his 2nd Congressional District seat in 1995 after being convicted of statutory rape for having sex with a 16-year-old campaign worker. He served 2\u00bd years in prison.\n\nLater, he was convicted in federal court of concealing debts to obtain bank loans and diverting money intended for voter registration drives into his election campaign. He was sentenced to 6\u00bd years in federal prison and had two years left when then-President Bill Clinton commuted the sentence in 2001.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Judge allows Reynolds to remain free, changes trial date - AP News: CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday allowed former .05/27/2016 8:09:36AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday allowed former Illinois Congressman Mel Reynolds to", "title": "AP News - Judge allows Reynolds to remain free, changes trial date", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/04/14/judge-allows-reynolds-to-remain-free-changes-trial-date-n2148799", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday allowed former Illinois Congressman Mel Reynolds to", "title": "AP News - Judge allows Reynolds to remain free, changes trial date", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/04/14/judge-allows-reynolds-to-remain-free-changes-trial-date-n2148799", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Judge allows Reynolds to remain free, changes trial date, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Assistant U.S. Attorney Barry Jonas pointed out Reynolds' bond violation and alleged possession of two passports in asking U.S District Judge John Darrah to place Reynolds on home confinement and electronic monitoring.\nHe also delayed Reynolds' trial on misdemeanor tax charges until June 20.\nReynolds has been allowed to travel to Africa twice since he pleaded not guilty last year to four counts of failing to file a tax return.\nCHICAGO (AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday allowed former Illinois Congressman Mel Reynolds to remain free despite traveling to South Africa in violation of his bond, supposedly to take care of his ailing daughter, and failing to show for a hearing on tax charges.\nHe was sentenced to 6\u00bd years in federal prison and had two years left when then-President Bill Clinton commuted the sentence in 2001."}
