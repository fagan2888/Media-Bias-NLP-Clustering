And as many as 1,300 more troops will be heading back to Iraq this year to serve in what the administration insists is an \u201cadvisory role\u201d to help \u201cdegrade and ultimately destroy\u201d ISIS. Meanwhile, the State Dept is offering a $5 million reward to get back an al Qaeda terrorist that the U.S. released from Gitmo in 2006. Townhall\u2019s Guy Benson also recently spoke with a former CIA official who defended the agency\u2019s use of Enhanced Interrogation Techniques on suspected terrorists after 9/11, saying that it saved an untold number of American lives. The Warner Bros. recently released a trailer for the upcoming film \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d about Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, who became the most deadly sniper in U.S. history during his four tours of duty in Iraq. There\u2019s also an interesting new documentary out about what it\u2019s like to be in the IDF.\n\nEconomy: Some relatively good news for the U.S. economy came out this week, with the Commerce Department releasing revised figures showing that the economy surged in the third quarter of the year. Now for the bad news: Fewer Americans are working today than before the recession began.\n\nCampaigns and elections: Despite the endless attacks against wealthy Republican donors during the 2014 election cycle, it turns out Democrats were the party that relied more on the rich to fund their electoral pursuits. And looking ahead to 2016, did Sen. Rand Paul announce he will run for president during a Twitter Festivus celebration?\n\n\u201cThe Interview\u201d saga continues: Last week the FBI determined North Korea was behind the cyber attack against Sony, but they continued to deny it and threatened to strike the U.S. for \u201crecklessly\u201d spreading that rumor. The country also experienced major Internet outages this week just days after President Obama had promised to respond proportionally. And in light of President Obama saying that Sony had made a mistake for not releasing the film (a point Sony\u2019s CEO said Obama was mistaken about), Townhall\u2019s Conn Carroll wonders why the president didn\u2019t call the entertainment network, seeing that other leaders in similar situations have done just that. In the end, Sony released the film online and in select theaters.\n\nCuba vows to protect cop killer: While New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie urged President Obama to demand that Cuba return cop killer Joanne Chesimard before the U.S. normalizes diplomatic relations, Cuba has defiantly said no, stating their right to protect \u2018persecuted\u2019 fugitives.\n\nInside the Beltway: The pizza industry will continue fighting against one of Obamacare\u2019s more onerous regulations. And the law as a whole will get another day in the Supreme Court, meaning the GOP has until June to replace it. Speaking of next year, here\u2019s nine fights you\u2019ll be seeing in Washington in 2015. It\u2019s too bad retiring Sen. Tom Coburn can\u2019t get his wish.\n\nImmigration: A federal judge dismissed Sheriff Joe Arpaio\u2019s lawsuit challenging President Obama\u2019s immigration overhaul this week. What does that mean for the suit filed by Texas?\n\nMerry Christmas: On the nice list is rock band Madison Rising, which is raising awareness for military families this holiday season. On the naughty list? You guessed it: Barack Obama. The GOP gave the president coal this year, but not for the reason you might think. Finally, we hope you all had a very Merry Christmas!\n\nGraphics by Feven Amenu.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics..05/26/2016 19:32:46PM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - The Friday Filibuster: Blue Lives Matter", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2014/12/26/the-friday-filibuster-blue-lives-matter-n1935963", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/12/26/0.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - The Friday Filibuster: Blue Lives Matter", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2014/12/26/the-friday-filibuster-blue-lives-matter-n1935963", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2014/12/26/0.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The Friday Filibuster: Blue Lives Matter , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The country also experienced major Internet outages this week just days after President Obama had promised to respond proportionally.\nIn the end, Sony released the film online and in select theaters.\nThe Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics.\nChris Christie urged President Obama to demand that Cuba return cop killer Joanne Chesimard before the U.S. normalizes diplomatic relations, Cuba has defiantly said no, stating their right to protect \u2018persecuted\u2019 fugitives.\nAnd looking ahead to 2016, did Sen.
