Crist says Florida should put high-speed rail back on track

Crist, who was in Orlando on Thursday night for a fundraiser hosted by his boss John Morgan, slipped away for a press conference and to shake most diners' hands in the Wildside BBQ Bar & Grille in the Thornton Park area.

Charlie Crist wants to bring the high-speed rail plan back to the Orlando-Tampa corridor, three years after Gov. Rick Scott canceled it and President Barack Obama redistributed its $2.4 billion in federal stimulus money to other states.

Now the Democratic front runner in the 2014 governor's race, Crist called for changes to Florida's Stand Your Ground law to exclude those who instigate conflicts and then shoot. He also defended budget decisions he made as a Republican governor, promoted the Affordable Care Act, and called for an alternative to I-4 traffic between Orlando and Tampa Bay.

Crist had championed the Orlando-to-Tampa bullet train plan as governor. Scott succeeded him and quickly rejected the plan, calling it a boondoggle that would cost Florida too much in the long run.

"It's just a shame that didn't happen," Crist said. "If we maybe have someone who gets along with the president, talks to him again, we maybe can get that high-speed rail money back here to Central Florida."

Crist said his 2009 and '10 budgets succeeded, though he used money he knew then would go away and constrict future budgets. That includes the one-time federal stimulus money he used to support teachers and other public employees, as well as increases in auto fees that Scott rolled back this week.

He avoided talking about the deeply recessed state economy that Scott inherited, but laid claim to the current improving economy, something that Scott contends is his legacy.

"We've got the largest budget in the history of Florida this year," Crist said. "So basically the bridge we put together for a better Florida worked out very well. So I'm glad."
