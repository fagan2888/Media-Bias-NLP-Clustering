An application to have Stanford University officially recognize a 60-member student kink club was rejected \u2014 for now. In an email, a representative for the Student Organization Review Committee, which is made up of students and staff, wrote that they \u201cliked the concept of your proposal but did not feel that as submitted it sufficiently met the criteria for a new student organization.\u201d She encouraged the group to apply again next quarter with a revised proposal.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed, but we\u2019re not surprised,\u201d said \u201cJon,\u201d a Stanford junior and member of the group, Kardinal Kink, which was started in April of last year. When asked why they weren\u2019t surprised by the rejection, Lily Z., the club\u2019s president, explained in an email, \u201cWe\u2019re not surprised by the culture we live in. Our society is a place where kink is expected to be rejected, expected to be pushed back down when it comes up \u2014 and Stanford is no exception.\u201d In another email, Jon argued that they were \u201crejecting us as a group for the same reasons LGBT-type groups were getting rejected a few decades ago.\u201d\n\nWhen I contacted Nanci Howe, associate dean of students, she expressed surprise to be hearing from a reporter, as \u201cthe students are still in the process of applying to be a student group.\u201d There are three responses to applications, she said: They are accepted, told to re-apply or rejected. \u201cIt\u2019s common for groups to be asked for more detail about their proposal,\u201d she said. \u201cThe majority of groups that provide additional information become recognized student groups.\u201d\n\nSo, Stanford is hardly taking a hard line against kink. In fact, a kink lecture series has already been allowed on campus. But the students feel that their application was held to higher standards because of the taboo nature of their club.\n\nLily shared the committee\u2019s email with Salon, along with rebuttals for each point. The committee requested \u201cbetter clarity about the scope of your group, especially in regards to clarity about your group\u2019s hoped for activities.\u201d She says the application made that clear in its first sentence, which read, \u201cKardinal Kink is both a support group and an advocacy group: a supportive anonymous space for Stanford students to explore kink themes safely and a public effort to campaign for resources, research, and respect for kink by promoting a positive and accurate understanding of kink sexuality on campus.\u201d\n\nImagining the university\u2019s worst fear, I asked whether their \u201choped for activities\u201d included, well, nudity or sex. \u201cAbsolutely not. No nudity, no sexual contact,\u201d said \u201cHelena,\u201d a Stanford sophomore and founder of Kardinal Kink. \u201cThese are discussion groups, they\u2019re support groups. There are lots of support groups on campus and this is just another one.\u201d Kardinal Kink also features guest lecturers. \u201cWe have well-known educators who have put their lives toward trying to educate people about sexuality and communication, come to campus \u2026 and teach us these skills that 20-year-olds may not be able to teach to each other,\u201d she explains.\n\nAs Jon put it, \u201cI don\u2019t think that the educational source for kink should be \u2018Fifty Shades of Grey.\u2019 I think it should be well-informed professionals and like-minded people that come together to educate.\u201d\n\nThe committee\u2019s email also asked that the group \u201cfind an experienced staff advisor who can \u2026 regularly work [with] you and your leadership, assisting you in developing best practices for your activities.\u201d Lily argues, \u201cThis is not a requirement for Student Organizations\u201d \u2014 indeed, a staff adviser is not listed as official criteria for approval \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s just a hoop to jump through.\u201d She added, \u201cThey think it\u2019s going to be nigh impossible to find faculty ready to ascribe their name to a Kink student group, hence why they put this out there.\u201d The email also suggests they \u201cpropose a name that is more in line with your group proposal,\u201d and \u201cdevelop a risk management plan for your group and its activities,\u201d which Lily calls \u201cambiguous\u201d and \u201cnot a requirement.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an exclusive conversation with Salon, Stanford's kinksters talk about seeking university approval", "title": "Hey, Ann Coulter!
