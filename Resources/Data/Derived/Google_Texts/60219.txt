AUBURN, Maine (AP) - The owners of Maine’s Lost Valley ski area have found a buyer to keep the Auburn ski area operating.

The Lewiston Sun Journal reports (http://bit.ly/1M9yh8V ) that the prospective buyer is tramway inspector Robert Scott Shanaman of Wilton, New Hampshire.

Owner Linc Hayes said the sales agreement is contingent on financing. Hayes said he and partner Connie King signed the agreement to sell Lost Valley Ski Banquet and Resort Friday night.

Staff at Lost Valley told the newspaper that rumors of the sale had spurred sales of discounted early season passes. Lost Valley had sold 375 season passes at the close of business Saturday, the last day to buy them at the discounted price. Last year, Lost Valley sold 255 discounted passes.

Hayes said Shanaman first expressed interest last winter.

“I think he knew we were struggling, so he let Connie know that for some reason, he was interested,” Hayes told the Sun Journal.

“He’s buying it for less than we were into it for,” Hayes said. “On top of that, he has the advantage of being in the trade and rubbing arms with the piston-pulley people and manufacturers. He knows the lifts and he knows that whole end of the trade, which gives him certain advantages.”

In June 2014, Hayes and King announced they might not be able to open for the 2014-15 ski season and were facing about $1.6 million in debt. A fundraising campaign and other events organized by local supporters who dubbed themselves Friends of Lost Valley raised about $23,000 - enabling the resort to open in January 2015.

The ski resort began operations in 1961.
