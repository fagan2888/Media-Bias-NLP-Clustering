The crisis facing the Greek prime minister now mutates by the hour\u2014deteriorating markedly over the past several days.\n\nAs of Sunday evening Greek time: After emergency meetings with monetary authorities, a Bank of Piraeus executive announced that Greek banks and the Athens stock market would remain closed Monday. The banks and markets are anticipating a run on deposits and a massive share selloff\u2014both having gathered momentum since the outlook for a deal with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund dimmed last week.\n\nThe scales have tipped, and a Greek default and a follow-on exit from the eurozone are again the ascendant prospect. Bitter as it is to say, Greece is better off in the end; so will be the much-tarnished European project.\n\nRelated: What\u2019s the Final Act in Greece\u2019s Debt Drama?\n\nAmbrose Evans-Pritchard, the finance columnist at The Telegraph, calls the Greek crisis \u201cthe Iraq war of finance\u201d and accuses the E.U. and the I.M.F. of \u201cdeliberately provoking a bank run and endangering Europe's system in their zeal to force Greece to its knees,\u201d the intent being \u201cto duck their own responsibilities leading to this impasse.\u201d\n\nAs of last week, it has never been plainer that the Greek crisis is all of Europe\u2019s, as this column has maintained for months. Now it is very baldly political, too\u2014far beyond the number-crunching technocrats in Brussels and at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt (where it never should have been domiciled, given its proximity to the German Bundesbank).\n\nEvents since the middle of last week are a scramble\u2014about as easy to dissect as a plate of moussaka. Chronology is all, so let\u2019s lay it out as it went:\n\n\u2022 By midweek, the E.U. and Athens had revised their bailout proposals in the course of back-to-back emergency meetings of European ministers with Tsipras and Yanis Varoufakis, his finance minister. The Greek side had made more politically perilous compromises, notably on budget surplus targets and in its proposed tax reforms, and notably not on already slashed public-sector pensions.\n\nThe E.U. advanced modified terms that amounted to tinkering at the margin. Example: The \u201cinstitutions,\u201d as Greece\u2019s lenders are called, allowed that hotels could be exempted from a higher consumption tax for the sake of tourism receipts. In their grim context, Greeks have a hard time counting this as a consequential concession.\n\nRelated: Stocks, Oil Slip With Eyes on Greece\n\nOn the table at this point was a five-month extension of the bailout. Sign the deal and roughly $8 billion of the rescue funds agreed in 2012 will flow. Don\u2019t, and Athens wouldn\u2019t be able to cover a $1.8 billion payment due at the I.M.F. this Tuesday.\n\n\u2022 Last Friday Tsipras announced that he would call for a public referendum on July 5th to determine the majority sentiment among Greek voters. Should he and Varoufakis sign the E.U.\u2019s late-hour offer or not? The referendum question would probably be more or less this simple.\n\n\u2022 On Saturday the E.U. reacted: It abruptly withdrew the bailout extension, leaving nothing left for Greeks to vote upon. It also refused Greece\u2019s request for an extension of talks to accommodate the July 5 vote. At this point spin became the game, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and leader of the Eurogroup finance ministers, being the point man.\n\nDijsselbloem immediately accused Tsipras of breaking off the talks. The referendum idea, he said, \u201chas closed the door on further talks while the door was still open, in my mind.\u201d When Varoufakis was excluded from a ministerial meeting Saturday afternoon, Dijsselbloem wouldn\u2019t use his name. \u201cOur Greek colleague will not attend,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated: Unfazed by Greece, Some Fund Managers Stay Bullish on Europe\n\n\u2022 Early Sunday morning the Greek parliament voted to back the referendum proposal. No surprise here: The left flank of the governing Syriza party, unhappy with Tsipras\u2019s horse-trading in Brussels, had hinted for several days it wanted one.\n\n\u2022 On Sunday morning, the E.C.B. announced that it wouldn\u2019t provide further increases in emergency funds to keep Greek banks liquid. Last week the E.C.B. raised its limit on liquidity funding to $9.8 billion. In effect, the Bank of Greece is now on notice that when the current provision runs out it\u2019ll be on its own covering an already evident run on Greek institutions.\n\n\u2022 Later Sunday, the Bank of Piraeus executive disclosed that banks and the stock exchange would remain closed Monday.\n\n\u2022 Also late Sunday, the E.C. B. board voted\u2014unexpectedly, like everything else lately\u2014to provide Greece roughly $2 billion in liquidity on Monday, the same amount it advanced Friday, indicating internal turmoil.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that [E.C.B. President Mario] Draghi doesn\u2019t want to be tagged as the one responsible for pushing Greece out of the eurozone,\u201d a European source wrote Sunday evening. \u201cI suspect he\u2019ll do the same Tuesday, so Greek banks can keep their heads just above water. By Tuesday there will have been another E.U.summit.\u201d\n\nYou got a problem with any of this? I got several.\n\nDid Tsipras abandon the bailout talks? Did Varoufakis decline to meet with E.U. counterparts Saturday? Is the referendum a political move intended to force the E.U. into a corner, as E.U. officials charge?\n\nMy answers: No, no, and yes.\n\nRelated: Factbox\u2014Key Points in Greece\u2019s Cash-for-Reform Proposals\n\nOne, calling the referendum was in no way tantamount to a walkout. The inverse reading is truer, in my view: It was implicit in his move that Tsipras took the deal seriously. If I\u2019m going to sign this, he as much as said, I have to make sure the people who put me in office are on for it. This hardly equates with rejection.\n\nTwo, Varoufakis was still working the telephones, tweeting, and trying to keep contacts open late into the weekend. Dijsselbloem\u2019s account of the Greek minister\u2019s stance was disingenuous to put the point too mildly.\n\nThree, the referendum is absolutely a political move. Narrowly, Tsipras has been skating on thin ice among key Syriza power blocs. Broadly, the anti-austerity majority in Greece have a prima facie right to judge a deal wherein Tsipras and Varoufakis have gone considerably further\u2014on privatizations, for instance\u2014than they promised when elected in January.\n\nWith his call for public consultation, Tsipras instantly crystallized the political tint the crisis has assumed. And that\u2019s the E.U.\u2019s core problem now.\n\nThe E.U.\u2019s swift recoil\u2014transparently combative, in my view\u2014reflected its fear of an indefensible outcome: Should Greek voters reject the latest bailout terms, the European position would be all too openly exposed. Europe has effectively argued all along that the democratic process\u2014to say nothing of the basic well-being of Greeks\u2014counts less than technocratic calculations and targets (which, in any case, have repeatedly proven wrong in Greece and elsewhere).\n\n\u201cDemocracy deserves a boost in euro-related matters,\u201d Varoufakis tweeted Friday in support of the referendum. \u201cWe have just delivered it. Let the people decide. (Funny how radical this concept sounds.)\u201d I find it hard to counter this observation.\n\nRelated: Merkel Holds Key in Her Hand, Varoufakis Says\n\nJust seven days ago, it seemed likely that a deal would be struck between Greece and its creditors. Today, as things stand, a Grexit starts to look inevitable.\n\nHere we go into capital controls and the monumental complexities attaching to remonetizing the drachma. Contacts, if not talks, continue. Something may emerge between now and Tuesday. But this is now the likely outcome.\n\nIf this is Armageddon in the war between unelected technocrats and the democratic process, as it so suddenly seems, the choice is hard and easy all at once: Grexit will be tough going for Greeks, no question, but to put democratic values above market values is a simple decision: There is no other choice.\n\nWhen the European project began in the immediate postwar years, Churchill, Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet and others explicitly advanced it as the instrument by which Europe must fortify its democracies. If Europe\u2019s progress now depends on turning this intent on its head, well, the Greeks will do every European a favor and an honor if they say, \u201cTurn back! Or not at all!\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The wind whistling past Alexis Tsipras\u2019s ears must be a deafening howl.", "title": "To the Brink: Why It\u2019s Time for Greece to Call the Euro Quits", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/06/29/Brink-Why-It-s-Time-Greece-Call-Euro-Quits", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06282015_Greek_Burns_Euro_money.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/06/29/Brink-Why-It-s-Time-Greece-Call-Euro-Quits", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06282015_Greek_Burns_Euro_money.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The wind whistling past Alexis Tsipras\u2019s ears must be a deafening howl.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Bitter as it is to say, Greece is better off in the end; so will be the much-tarnished European project.\nRelated: Unfazed by Greece, Some Fund Managers Stay Bullish on Europe\u2022 Early Sunday morning the Greek parliament voted to back the referendum proposal.\nAmbrose Evans-Pritchard, the finance columnist at The Telegraph, calls the Greek crisis \u201cthe Iraq war of finance\u201d and accuses the E.U.\nand Athens had revised their bailout proposals in the course of back-to-back emergency meetings of European ministers with Tsipras and Yanis Varoufakis, his finance minister.\nPresident Mario] Draghi doesn\u2019t want to be tagged as the one responsible for pushing Greece out of the eurozone,\u201d a European source wrote Sunday evening."}
