California Teachers involved public sector workers. But had the high court ruled in favor of 10 California schoolteachers who object to that state\u2019s agency shop rules, it likely would have created additional momentum for right-to-work initiatives in the private sector, according to a team of researchers with the Center for Worker Freedom, a project of Americans for Tax Reform.\n\nThe court announced its 4-4 deadlock Tuesday. Rebecca Friedrichs, a 28-year veteran of the Savannah School District in Anaheim, Calif., and the lead plaintiff, has said that she and her legal team plan to file a petition for a rehearing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate and disappointing, and everything is going to depend on who the new [Supreme Court] justice is,\u201d James Sherk, a labor policy analyst with The Heritage Foundation, said. \u201cBut states should continue in their efforts to protect worker freedom.\u201d\n\nSince half of the justices on the Supreme Court were prepared to rule in favor of Friedrichs and her nine co-plaintiffs, the court\u2019s ruling should be taken as a sign that the \u201cnotion of forcing workers to pay an advocacy organization to campaign for public policies they oppose is on shaky legal ground,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the meantime, efforts aimed at freeing workers from forced unionization remain the subject of ongoing litigation. Already, several unions have filed suit to overturn the right-to-work ordinance in Lincolnshire, Ill.\n\nBefore the Feb. 13 death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the teachers who were the plaintiffs in Friedrichs appeared poised to secure a major victory against the unions on behalf of free speech.\n\nFor this reason, as The Daily Signal reported last month, researchers with the Center for Worker Freedom put together what they term the \u201c2016 Indicator of Labor Liberty,\u201d maps that show how the right-to-work landscape would look before and after a ruling in favor of the Friedrichs plaintiffs.\n\nRight-to-work laws prohibit an employer and a union from signing a contract that would require workers to be union members. An \u201cagency shop\u201d like the one for California teachers requires that the workers who do not want to join the union instead pay it a fee instead of dues.\n\nThe center offers two versions of the map. One highlights the status quo of labor law across the country; the other demonstrates how government workers in 25 states would be freed from forced unionization if the high court someday were to rule mandatory dues unconstitutional.\n\nColor schemes distinguish the states.\n\nRed states have the most worker freedom, because a worker\u2019s decision whether to join a union or pay union fees is voluntary in both the public and private sectors. Blue states have the least freedom, because union requirements apply to both government and non-government workers.\n\nSo, what would happen if Friedrichs and her fellow teachers were to prevail at the Supreme Court? Those blue states, which include New Mexico, California, Oregon, Washington, and states concentrated in the Northeast, would flip to the color gray to show that public sector workers in those states are free. Purple and green states also would flip to gray.\n\nUnder Challenge\n\nWith the status quo locked in place for now, the Center for Worker Freedom identified a need for greater clarification in state labor law. This is especially true in those states that have a peculiar mix of worker freedom and forced unionization, such as Kentucky, Wisconsin, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, and Missouri.\n\nThe center adjusted its categorization of Illinois and Michigan after initial release of its \u201clabor liberty\u201d maps to reflect legalities particular to those states.\n\nSherk, the Heritage labor policy analyst, recommends that the researchers\u2019 maps take pending litigation into consideration.\n\nIn Illinois, for example, Sherk points out that Gov. Bruce Rauner\u2019s executive order prohibiting the exacting of \u201cfair share\u201d fees from state employees \u201cis tied up in litigation and not currently in effect.\u201d\n\nMoreover, he says, the Republican governor\u2019s measure doesn\u2019t apply to local government employees such as schoolteachers.\n\nPatterson has a different view of the situation in Illinois.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that Governor Rauner\u2019s executive order in Illinois is under legal challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, those legal proceedings were on hold pending a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Friedrichs. Now that the high court has issued a split decision, we expect the issue of public workers in Illinois to now proceed in federal District Court and above.\u201d\n\nMore Choice in Illinois\n\nPaige Halper, a research fellow at the Center for Worker Freedom who is project leader for the Liberty Indicator, notes that just because Rauner\u2019s executive order isn\u2019t being enforced, doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be considered valid.\n\n\u201cRight now, the First Amendment isn\u2019t being enforced either [in U.S. labor law],\u201d Halper says. \u201cBut it\u2019s still considered the law of the land.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the Center for Worker Freedom chose to portray Illinois in its Liberty Indicator as \u201cpublic sector voluntary,\u201d in effect lending moral support to Rauner\u2019s order, though Patterson concedes others take a different view.\n\nBut what about local government employees?\n\nPatterson is not convinced they\u2019re excluded under the executive order.\n\n\u201cLocal jurisdictions exist at the discretion of the state government and therefore are, in a sense, extensions of it,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cSo if it\u2019s unconstitutional for state labor authorities to force state workers to pay union fees, as the governor argues, it follows that it\u2019s also unconstitutional to make local employees pay the fees.\u201d\n\nThe Center for Worker Freedom altered its color category for Illinois in response to a local right-to-work initiative in that state.\n\n\u201cThe town of Lincolnshire recently passed a local right-to-work ordinance, similar to what was done in Kentucky,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cAnd even though it is under legal challenge, we changed Illinois on our map to yellow to reflect the fact that some private workers now have a choice.\u201d\n\nMichigan and Missouri\n\nThe situation in Michigan also presents complications.\n\n\u201cMichigan\u2019s right-to-work law, like Wisconsin\u2019s, only covers some government employees,\u201d Sherk told the Daily Signal in an email. \u201cIt does not apply to police or firefighters.\u201d\n\nThe Center for Worker Freedom, after consulting with Sherk, changed Michigan\u2019s color on its map to green, reflecting the fact that some public workers\u2014police officers and firefighters\u2014currently are forced to pay the union. But even here, Patterson said, it need not be the case:\n\nIn our view, the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s decision [upholding the state\u2019s public sector right-to-work law] begs the question why some workers are forced to pay and others not. If it is unconstitutional for some, it\u2019s easy to see a policeman or firefighter questioning the constitutionality of his or her own forced dues.\n\nAs for Missouri, and whether its public sector workers are forced to pay the unions, Halper\u2019s research found no statute or legislation indicating freedom to opt out for the state\u2019s public workers.\n\n\u201cWe called several government agencies, including the state\u2019s Department of Labor,\u201d Halper told the Daily Signal. \u201cWe were told that the issue is decided on a case-by-case basis between unions and employers. Because in theory that means that any public worker in Missouri can be forced to pay, we decided to leave the state blue [meaning compulsory union fees for public and private workers] for the time being.\u201d\n\n\u2018A Catalyst\u2019\n\nLuke Hilgemann, CEO of Americans for Prosperity, said he views the \u201cLabor Liberty\u201d maps as a call to action on a front where his organization already leads the charge. Hilgemann said:\n\nWe have engaged in a comprehensive citizen education campaign to let people know about their rights. Even though 26 states have passed right-to-work [laws], it is up to groups like ours to go out and educate citizens about their rights. When the laws change they are not going to get the straight story from the union representation. I think that\u2019s where we come in since there are a lot of misconceptions that are spread around by organized labor.\n\nFour years ago, Americans for Prosperity organized a town hall event in Waukesha, Wis., to inform average citizens about their rights under existing labor law. Hilgemann sees the gathering as a prototype for what might come.\n\n\u201cWorker freedom can be a catalyst for reform down the road,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you get organized labor out of the way, it clears the slate for other free market ideas to start taking hold.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Workers across the nation have ample opportunity to challenge why they\u2019re forced to pay for political activism by unions that they don\u2019t support.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Workers across the nation have ample opportunity to challenge why they\u2019re forced to pay for political activism by unions that they don\u2019t support.", "title": "Illinois Town a New Front on Nation's Right-to-Work Map", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160401_RTA_States_Mooney.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-01T18:19:44+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1ToJHd4"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Workers across the nation have ample opportunity to challenge why they\u2019re forced to pay for political activism by unions that they don\u2019t support.", "title": "Illinois Town a New Front on Nation's Right-to-Work Map", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160401_RTA_States_Mooney.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "labor", "published_time": "2016-04-01T16:34:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-01T18:19:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "right to work, right-to-work, Rebecca Friedrichs, Friedrichs v.
