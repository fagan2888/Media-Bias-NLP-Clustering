Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is taking on the companies that make up the \u201cgig economy\u201d \u2014 though they provide the jobs, and services, that are increasingly popular among the young, \u201cprogressive\u201d Americans who are the core of Warren\u2019s support.\n\nIn a speech last week to the left-wing New America Foundation, Warren argued that \u2014 without killing companies like Uber \u2014 labor protections needed to be extended to the independent contractors who form the core of those companies\u2019 workforce.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWarren said:\n\nIt\u2019s exciting\u2014and very hip\u2014to talk about Uber and Lyft and Taskrabbit, but the promise and risks of these companies isn\u2019t new. For centuries, technological advances have helped create new wealth and have increased GDP. But it is policy \u2013 rules and regulations \u2013 that will determine whether workers have a meaningful opportunity to share in that new wealth. \u2026 At the same time that the bargain with workers has become increasingly one-sided for millions of independent contractors and hourly employees, yet another part of the basic economic bargain has also begun to fray. The safety net\u2014unemployment insurance, workers comp, Social Security\u2014hasn\u2019t been updated to fill in the holes that employers have created. Temporary workers, contract workers, seasonal workers, permatemps, and part-time workers rarely have access to these benefits, which means that the workers who most need that safety net are least likely to have it. The gig economy didn\u2019t invent any of these problems. In fact, the gig economy has become a stopgap for some workers who can\u2019t make ends meet in a weak labor market. The much-touted virtues of flexibility, independence, and creativity offered by gig work might be true for some workers under some conditions, but for many, the gig economy is simply the next step in a losing effort to build some economic security in a world where all the benefits are floating to the top 10%.\n\nWarren proposed that every worker \u2014 including independent contractors in the \u201cgig economy\u201d \u2014 be required to pay into Social Security. She suggested that every company be required to protect independent contractors with catastrophic insurance. And she said that independent contractors should be entitled to paid leave. She added that \u201cevery worker should have the right to organize\u2014period.\u201d\n\nWarren did not explain how these policies would work without raising costs for companies, or making it more difficult for would-be independent contractors to find opportunities. Nor did Warren address the role of regulations in stifling economic growth and creating downward pressure on middle class employment and wages over the past several decades.\n\nShe did, however, cite Obamacare as a success story for workers who might not otherwise have health insurance \u2014 though many young people are electing to pay the IRS an annual fine rather than purchase gold-plated policies on government websites.\n\nUnions\u2019 efforts to organize Uber drivers have proved unsuccessful. Last month, the company settled class action lawsuits and cleared the legal pathway for it to treat its drivers as independent contractors. Warren says that those contractors must also be protected, and that the lack of more widespread protections is part of what is pushing them to drive for Uber in the first place.\n\nJoel B.
