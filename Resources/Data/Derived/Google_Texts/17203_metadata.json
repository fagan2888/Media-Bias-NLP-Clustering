Approximately one-seventh of our national economy today is health care related,\u201d wrote Carson. \u201cWhat if we were smart enough to set aside just 10 percent of that each year to begin a national medical endowment? If we were wise enough and disciplined enough to risk doing that for 10 to 15 years, we would be talking a corpus of three trillion dollars. What could we do with the interest on that? We could easily take care of the forty-four million people who have no insurance and quite a few more than that.\u201d\n\nCarson added, \u201cAnd if we continued to do that for another ten to fifteen years, we might be talking about a corpus large enough to fund American health care forever\u2014 without ever adding another dime to it. Not only would we provide for everyone Medicare and Medicaid now provide for (only better and without the complex rules and costly bureaucracy), but we would actually have what many think they should have\u2014 free, universal health care. Except it wouldn\u2019t really be free, just paid for. Once and for all.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s plans to address health care in America have shifted over the course of his campaign. For more than a decade, Carson had said the government should take over the responsibility of catastrophic care and health insurance companies should be regulated like utilities. During much of this campaign season, Carson\u2019s health care plan included doing away with Medicaid and Medicare and giving a $2,000 stipend to each American to set up health savings accounts. For both plans, Carson advocated for giving the equivalent of food stamps to the poor for medical care.\n\nCarson wrote in the late ninties that his interest in the idea of a national health care endowment came from the success a program \u201cAngels in OR,\u201d (video above) which provided funds help the needy pay for medical operations.\n\nWrote Carson:", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 4066272, "userid": 227410}, "google-signin-clientid": "895639880237-tcoheof19odpd88p676rjc70v0iqit0o.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "\"We could create a corpus, an endowment fund, the interest on which we use to pay the medical expenses of the neediest.\"..", "copyright": "Copyright 2016 BuzzFeed, Inc.
