With the increasing shift towards outpatient and ambulatory care, the need to capture and measure that volume becomes increasingly important in assessing the strength of a hospital or health system's future revenue stream.'\n\nReflecting national trends, from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2013 Fitch's rated hospital and health system portfolio experienced a decline of inpatient volume compared to an increase in ambulatory services.\n\nFitch believes that value-based reimbursement models, risk sharing arrangements and increasing consumerism will reward those providers that deliver high quality, low cost care in the most convenient setting.\n\nStill, traditional inpatient, volume based metrics remain important indicators of market relevance and competitive position. In addition, inpatient admissions, surgical volumes, emergency room visits, average length of stay and case mix index will continue to have a strong influence on overall profitability.\n\nFor more information, a special report titled 'Utilization Metrics Review' is available on the Fitch Ratings web site at www.fitchratings.com.\n\nAdditional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.\n\nApplicable Criteria and Related Research: Fitch: Utilization Metrics Review (A New Business Model for the Healthcare Industry)\n\nhttp://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=759607\n\nALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.
