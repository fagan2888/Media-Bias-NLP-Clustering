Maybe, when you were a kid, your lunch tray was filled with so much green you thought that you\u2019d turn into a rabbit? No? Hmm. Anyway, what if there was a magical alternate reality where things like pizza and French fries had the same health benefits as apples and lettuce? If that actually existed, there\u2019d probably be no war or famine, we\u2019d have colonized the solar system, and our life expectancies would be extended 10-fold.\n\nUnfortunately, that alternate reality only exists in this parody video from Funny or Die. Nick Offerman, whose mustache you may recognize from Parks and Recreation and the Internet, plays a pizza farmer who just wants kids to eat healthy, delicious, \u201csun-kissed\u201d pepperoni pizzas. His farm sells taquitos, fish sticks, and more, all with the knowledge that kids know what is right for their bodies.\n\nThis video is part of an initiative run by the American Heart Association, which is running a campaign to get Congress to renew the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act. The act raised the quality of school lunches across the country. It has helped kids eat 16 percent more vegetables and 23 percent more fruit. It has also helped kids cut down on sugary beverages, eat more vitamins and minerals, and have a better overall diet.\n\nThough the video is just for fun, it would be great if pizza farms were a thing.

Acres of pizza, kissed by the sun, stretching as far as the eye can see.\u201d If only\u2026", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "nick, offerman, pizza, farmer, here, tell, you, about, health, benefits, farm, grown, pizza", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In this parody video from \"Funny or Die,\" Nick Offerman plays a pizza farmer who wants kids to eat delicious, all-natural pizzas, fish sticks, and taquitos.", "title": "Nick Offerman Shows Us The Health Benefits Of Farm-Fresh Pizza [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/nick-offerman-pizza-farmer-here-tell-you-about-health-benefits-farm-grown-pizza-342956", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/14/nick-offerman-pizza-farmer.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In this parody video from \"Funny or Die,\" Nick Offerman plays a pizza farmer who wants kids to eat delicious, all-natural pizzas, fish sticks, and taquitos.", "title": "Nick Offerman Shows Us The Health Benefits Of Farm-Fresh Pizza [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/nick-offerman-pizza-farmer-here-tell-you-about-health-benefits-farm-grown-pizza-342956", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/07/14/nick-offerman-pizza-farmer.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/14/nick-offerman-pizza-farmer.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-14T16:58:07-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-14T16:58:06-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "In this parody video from \"Funny or Die,\" Nick Offerman plays a pizza farmer who wants kids to eat delicious, all-natural pizzas, fish sticks, and taquitos."}, "article_summary": "It has helped kids eat 16 percent more vegetables and 23 percent more fruit.\nNick Offerman, whose mustache you may recognize from Parks and Recreation and the Internet, plays a pizza farmer who just wants kids to eat healthy, delicious, \u201csun-kissed\u201d pepperoni pizzas.\nIt has also helped kids cut down on sugary beverages, eat more vitamins and minerals, and have a better overall diet.\nThe act raised the quality of school lunches across the country.\nHave you ever felt that school lunches were too healthy?"}
