Polls suggest that he is the early front-runner in Iowa and a top-tier candidate nationally, because of his reputation with conservatives built on defeating public-sector unions and surviving a recall election in his first term.\n\nMr. Walker is making the case that unlike the senators in the Republican race, who include Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, he has a record of hard-won policy achievements.\n\n\u201cSome want you to think they fight,\u201d Mr. Walker wrote of his rivals on the conservative website RedState last week. \u201cBut speeches aren\u2019t fighting or winning.\u201d\n\nIn front of partisan audiences around the country, Mr. Walker often portrays himself as more ideologically conservative than he has been in Wisconsin. He takes credit, for example, for signing an anti-union \u201cright to work\u201d law this year, something that actually bubbled up from his Legislature after the governor insisted in his re-election race in 2014 that it was not a priority.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d be in the position he\u2019s in right now if it wasn\u2019t for the Republican Legislature,\u201d said Mr. Fitzgerald, who sponsored the bill. \u201cWe\u2019ve been a big part of that list of reforms.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Walker has notched other recent successes in the Legislature that are red-meat issues on the campaign trail, such as requiring drug testing for people on public assistance and loosening tenure protection for professors.\n\nOne issue he played down in 2014 but has seized on in early nominating states, where social conservatives are highly influential, is banning abortions after 20 weeks.\n\nMr. Walker repeatedly refused to say if he favored such a ban during his close re-election last year, when polls showed him unpopular among women. In March, as doubts about his anti-abortion credentials were raised by national conservatives, he pledged to sign a 20-week ban that was \u201clikely to come to my desk.\u201d\n\nWhat he did not explain was that he had asked Wisconsin lawmakers to send him just such a bill, during a meeting in his office with Mr. Fitzgerald and Robin Vos, the speaker of the State Assembly, also a Republican.\n\n\u201cWalker weighed in and said the 20-week abortion ban is something he would like to see hit his desk,\u201d Mr. Fitzgerald said. \u201cIt sent a message to us.\u201d\n\nThe governor specified that the bill should include no exceptions for rape or incest, according to Mr. Fitzgerald.\n\nThe dispute with the Legislature is, at root, a debate over what is best for Wisconsin\u2019s economy. Republican lawmakers favor investments in infrastructure and higher education, and the governor is committed to not raising taxes.\n\nMr. Vos has accused Mr. Walker of avoiding an \u201cadult conversation\u201d on infrastructure costs.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Mr. Walker boasts of lowering taxes by $2 billion and presiding over a drop in unemployment from 7.7 percent in January 2011, when he took office, to 4.6 percent. His fiscal discipline is echoed in his penny-pinching lifestyle. (He recently told of buying a $1 sweater at Kohl\u2019s.)\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat he does not mention is that Wisconsin ranked 35th in job growth in the nation during his first term, and that it trails its neighbors in the Upper Midwest.\n\nThe tax cuts and weakening of public sector unions have not spurred the economy enough to avoid a projected budget deficit over the coming two years.\n\nThe state\u2019s nonpartisan budget office estimated this year that Wisconsin would save $345 million in its budget over two years by accepting Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. Unlike the Republican governors of four nearby states, Mr. Walker refused expansion, a litmus test for conservatives.\n\nThe governor got the greatest resistance on his budget blueprint, which covers two years, over two proposals: to fill a hole in the transportation fund with the debt financing, and to cut $300 million from the University of Wisconsin system.\n\n\u201cThe university doesn\u2019t deserve this cut,\u201d said Senator Luther Olsen, a Republican, as lawmakers voted last month to restore $50 million of the governor\u2019s cuts. \u201cWe are fools if we go around bashing one of the best things in the state of Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nTo pay for road and bridge projects, Mr. Vos, the Assembly speaker, and other Republicans favor raising vehicle registration fees. Mr. Walker labeled a fee increase the same as a tax increase, and promised a veto.\n\n\u201cHe wants to make a political point that \u2018I didn\u2019t increase fees or taxes,\u2019 \u201d said Representative Gordon Hintz, a Democrat on the Joint Finance Committee, which drafts the budget. \u201cThe false choice created by the governor\u2019s presidential politics leads to outcomes which negatively impact the people of Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nTo accommodate the governor, Republicans are wrangling behind closed doors over some combination of borrowing and delaying needed projects.\n\nThe governor\u2019s press secretary, Laurel Patrick, said Mr. Walker had been consistent in opposing an increase in the gas tax or vehicle fees without a corresponding cut in taxes. \u201cWhile obviously not our preferred option, if legislators choose to reduce bonding for transportation in the budget, Governor Walker would sign it,\u201d Ms. Patrick said in a statement.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Fitzgerald, the Senate majority leader, said he did not have the votes to pass a budget yet. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out how to get out of the box,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150623135651, "twitter": {"description": "Gov.
