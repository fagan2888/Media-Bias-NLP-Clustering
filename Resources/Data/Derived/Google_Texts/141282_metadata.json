You hit \u2018find plans,\u2019 and you immediately see the exchange plans that are available for that zip code,\u201d Liang said.\n\nLiang, Kalogeropoulos and Wasser have experience working at tech-savvy companies, including Microsoft and Twitter, and currently oversee their own Internet start-ups. But they say thehealthsherpa.com, which is only two weeks old, isn\u2019t about money \u2013 it\u2019s a public service.\n\n\u201cThere was no thought of, \u2018How do we make money this time?\u2019\u201d Wasser told CBS. \u201cIt was like, \u2018This is a problem that we know we can solve in a really short period of time. So let\u2019s just do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe three programmers based their site, which took them a couple of nights to create, off code buried by high-priced contractors on the original Obamacare website. They simply found an easier and cheaper way to make the experience doable for the average consumer.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the great thing about having such a small team,\u201d Kalogeropoulos said. \u201cYou sit around a table and say, \u2018OK, how does this work?\u2019 There\u2019s no coordination meetings, there\u2019s no planning sessions. It\u2019s like, \u2018Well, let\u2019s read the document and let\u2019s implement this.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe programmers even added a feature to help users calculate whether they\u2019re eligible for tax subsidies under the new health care law.\n\n\u201c(T)he subsidy calculation is fairly complicated, but it wasn\u2019t too bad,\u201d said Liang.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that you can\u2019t actually enroll in Obamacare through thehealthsherpa.com, and it doesn\u2019t perform every function healthcare.gov was designed to perform.\n\nStill, the site does offer contact information for health insurance providers, which means someone could sign up without ever having to use healthcare.gov.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter\n\nFeatured image via thehealthsherpa.com.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "As the Obamacare website continues to confound both users and government officials, three 20-something San Francisco-area programmers say they\u2019ve created a much simpler and cost-effective version of the site.
