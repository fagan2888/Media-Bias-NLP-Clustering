Imagine if each one of their parents were held accountable. A couple in the United Kingdom has been arrested for neglect and child cruelty for letting their 11-year-old son become obese.\n\nAfter the 210-lb. boy was treated at the Queen Elizabeth hospital twice in March, doctors contacted the police under suspicion of child neglect. The 49-year-old father and 43-year-old mother were both questioned, to which the pair insisted that they were trying to keep their son at a healthy weight and encouraged him to exercise regularly.\n\n\"My son has always been big. Everyone on my side of the family is,\" said his father, according to The Guardian. Genetics aren\u2019t the real issue here. The police spokesman said that the officers from the child abuse investigation unit are working closely with health and social services in order to treat the case with as much sensitivity as possible, considering the rare circumstance.\n\n\"While it is inappropriate to comment on this case specifically, it is important to stress that intervention at this level is very rare and will only occur where other attempts to protect the child have been unsuccessful,\" the spokesman said.\n\nThe parents voluntarily arrived at the police station where they were interviewed. However, it wasn\u2019t their first visit. They were arrested in March on suspicion of child neglect and cruelty under section 1 of the Children and Young Person Act of 1933.\n\nThe act protects children under the age of 16 from \u201ccruelty and exposure to moral and physical danger.\u201d The Act is intended to prevent willful assaults, ill-treatment, neglect, abandonment, or unnecessary suffering or injury to health, or else the accused could be imprisoned for up to 10 years in addition to fines.\n\nIn section A, it clearly specifies the reasoning for the recent arrest: \u201cA parent or other person legally liable to maintain a child or young person shall be deemed to have neglected him in a manner likely to cause injury to his health if he has failed to provide adequate food, clothing, medical aid or lodging for him.\u201d\n\nThe key basis for arrest is \u201cadequate food.\u201d A child will not become obese unless they have an obscure medical condition that would have been noted by the hospital. The 11-year-old boy had a body mass index of 39.7 for his particular height and weight. Obesity is measured 30 or greater, with a normal weight lower than 25.\n\n\u201cThe idea that they could take away my son scares me so much. I\u2019m nothing without my kids,\u201d his mother told the newspaper. Obesity puts children at serious health risks, with increased likelihood of a high cholesterol, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, certain cancers, and mental and emotional tolls such as social and psychological problems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Children are especially susceptible to stigmatizations, bullying, and poor self-esteem.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always been big. He was born with shovels for hands and spades for feet. Everyone on my side of the family is big. There\u2019s nothing we can do about it,\u201d the father said. \u201cI only eat occasional kebabs. Our son\u2019s favorite snack is steamed broccoli \u2014 and he\u2019s still big,\u201d\n\nPrevention is the key, and healthy lifestyle habits including eating nutritiously balanced meals and participating in physical activity significantly lower the risk of a child becoming obese regardless of the genetic susceptibility from their parents. Much of this advice is neglected because of recent changes in societal values and priorities. In the last 30 years, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the United States alone.\n\n\"His weight isn't that much of a big deal. I'm chubby and the whole of my husband's side of the family is big. It's genetics \u2014 you can be genetically fat.\"\n\nThe genetic excuse for obesity is considered a myth. A research team from the Medical Research Council\u2019s Epidemiology Unit in Cambridge sought to understand if there was any truth behind genetic susceptibility. After experts reviewed the DNA of more than 20,000 men and women and focused in on certain genes known to raise the risk of obesity, they found that simple physical activity, such as walking the dog and gardening \u201cdramatically\u201d reduced the impact of their genes.\n\nDr. Ruth Loos, the study\u2019s lead author concluded, \u201cIt goes to show we're not complete slaves to our genetic makeup and really can make a big difference to our future health by changing our behavior.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "childhood, obesity, blamed, parents, uk, couple, arrested, because, son, became, obese", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Parents were arrested for suspected child neglect and abuse because their son has become obese.", "title": "Do You Think Parents Should Be Arrested For Their Child\u2019s Weight Issues?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/childhood-obesity-blamed-parents-uk-couple-arrested-because-son-became-obese-considered-child-287214", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/09/uk-parents-arrested-because-their-son-obese.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Parents were arrested for suspected child neglect and abuse because their son has become obese.", "title": "Do You Think Parents Should Be Arrested For Their Child\u2019s Weight Issues?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/childhood-obesity-blamed-parents-uk-couple-arrested-because-son-became-obese-considered-child-287214", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/09/uk-parents-arrested-because-their-son-obese.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/09/uk-parents-arrested-because-their-son-obese.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-09T10:39:57-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-09T11:13:52-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Parents were arrested for suspected child neglect and abuse because their son has become obese."}, "article_summary": "boy was treated at the Queen Elizabeth hospital twice in March, doctors contacted the police under suspicion of child neglect.\nA couple in the United Kingdom has been arrested for neglect and child cruelty for letting their 11-year-old son become obese.\nThey were arrested in March on suspicion of child neglect and cruelty under section 1 of the Children and Young Person Act of 1933.\nChildhood obesity is an epidemic in America, with more than one-third of all children and adolescents either overweight or obese.\n\"My son has always been big."}
