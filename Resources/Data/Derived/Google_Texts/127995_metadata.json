Once in the brain it causes a swelling called primary meningoencephalitis. The infection is almost universally fatal: it kills more than 97 percent of its victims within days.\n\nAlthough deadly, infections are exceedingly uncommon\u2014there were only 34 reported in the U.S. during the past 10 years\u2014but evidence suggests they may be increasing. Prior to 2010 more than half of cases came from Florida, Texas and other southern states. Since then, however, infections have popped up as far north as Minnesota.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing it in states where we hadn\u2019t seen cases before,\u201d says Jennifer Cope, an epidemiologist and expert in amoeba infections at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The expanding range of Naegleria infections could potentially be related to climate change, she adds, as the organism thrives in warmer temperatures. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re definitely keeping an eye on.\u201d\n\nStill, \u201cwhen it comes to Naegleria there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know,\u201d Cope says\u2014including why it chooses its victims. The amoeba has strategies to evade the immune system, and treatment options are meager partly because of how fast the infection progresses.\n\nBut research suggests that the infectioncan be stopped if it is caught soon enough. So what happens during an N. fowleri infection?\n\nThe microscopic amoebae, which can be suspended in water or nestled in soil, enter the body when water goes up the nose. After attaching to the mucous membranes in the nasal cavity, N. fowleri burrows into the olfactory nerve, the structure that enables our sense of smell and leads directly to the brain. It probably takes more than a drop of liquid to trigger a Naegleria infection; infections usually occur in people who have been engaging in water sports or other activities that may forcefully suffuse the nose with lots of water\u2014diving, waterskiing, wakeboarding, and in one case a baptism dunking.\n\nIt turns out that \u201cbrain eating\u201d is actually a pretty accurate description for what the amoeba does. After reaching the olfactory bulbs, N. fowleri feasts on the tissue there using suction-cup-like structures on its surface. This destruction leads to the first symptoms\u2014loss of smell and taste\u2014about five days after the infection sets in.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Neagleria fowleri dwells in warm freshwater lakes and rivers and typically targets children and young adults", "title": "What happens when an amoeba \u201ceats\u201d your brain", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Neagleria fowleri dwells in warm freshwater lakes and rivers and typically targets children and young adults", "title": "What happens when an amoeba \u201ceats\u201d your brain", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/20/what_happens_when_an_amoeba_eats_your_brain_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_173063666.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Neagleria fowleri dwells in warm freshwater lakes and rivers and typically targets children and young adults", "title": "What happens when an amoeba \u201ceats\u201d your brain", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/shutterstock_173063666.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Roni Jacobson", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Amoeba, Scientific American", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "So what happens during an N. fowleri infection?\nTopics: Amoeba, Scientific American, Life NewsThis article was originally published by Scientific AmericanLast week, nine-year-old Hally Yust died after contracting a rare brain-eating amoeba infection while swimming near her family\u2019s home in Kansas.\nAfter reaching the olfactory bulbs, N. fowleri feasts on the tissue there using suction-cup-like structures on its surface.\nThe expanding range of Naegleria infections could potentially be related to climate change, she adds, as the organism thrives in warmer temperatures.\nThe organism responsible, Naegleria fowleri, dwells in warm freshwater lakes and rivers and usually targets children and young adults."}
