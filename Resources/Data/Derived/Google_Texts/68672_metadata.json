KYW Community Affairs reporter Cherri Gregg attended a press conference in North Philadelphia where lawmakers called the island\u2019s debt situation\u2013 a humanitarian crisis.\n\nMired in more than 72-billion dollars in debt, jobs are becoming scarce in Puerto Rico with roughly half of the island\u2019s population living below the poverty line. This economic crisis has forced hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans to flee the island for the US Mainland over the past decade, with scores of families abandoning their homeland each month.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re asking for the ability to declare bankruptcy and restructure our debt,\u201d says Philadelphia Councilwoman Maria Quiones Sanchez. She joined state and local leaders who say the 400,000 Puerto Ricans in Pennsylvania are coming together to demand that Congress give the territory the US territory the power it needs to determine its own fate. She says half of the 3.7 million people living on the island are in poverty, so the 5 million Puerto Ricans living on the mainland are using their political power to help their brethren.\n\n\u201cThe crisis is not five years from now; the crisis is in three weeks\u2013 in January Puerto Rico runs out of money period and will not be able to pay its debt,\u201d says Angel Ortiz, a former member of Philadelphia City Council.\u201dThey will have to lay off teachers, they will not be able to pay pensions\u2026if Puerto Rico goes bankrupt it will have a ripple effect.\u201d\n\nPennsylvania for Puerto Rico will send four bus loads of supports from Philadelphia to Washington Wednesday to lobby Congress. The group, along with others from across the country are demanding that Congress 1) Grant Puerto Rico Bankruptcy and Debt Restructuring; 2) Eliminate Medicaid Inequities & Preserve Health Care Access in Puerto Rico and 3) Uplift Puerto Rican Families by Extending the Federal Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking for anything we haven\u2019t had in the past,\u201d says Quiones-Sanchez, who notes the territory of P.R. once had the right to declare bankruptcy, but lost it when laws change.\n\nQuiones-Sanchez and others claim the Hispanic Caucus supported President Obama in the passage of the Affordable Care Act with the understanding there would be equity for Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cWe need Congress to Act,\u201d she says, \u201cand if Congress will not act\u2013 Obama has the power to implement an executive order.\u201d\n\nThe group claims Puerto Rico\u2019s debt crisis is the result of bad tax policy.\n\n\u201cLet Puerto Rico decide its fate,\u201d says Pa State Representative Angel Cruz.\n\nFor more on Pennsylvania for Puerto Rico (#PA4PR), contact the Hispanic Federation at info@hispanicfederation.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At a press conference in North Philadelphia, lawmakers called the island's debt situation 'a humanitarian crisis.'", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2015/11/30/pa-for-puerto-rico-join-national-coalition-to-pressure-lawmakers-to-take-action-on-islands-debt-crisis/", "image": {"width": 1280, "secure_url": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/pa-for-puerto-rico.jpg?w=1280", "identifier": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/pa-for-puerto-rico.jpg?w=1280", "height": 960}, "type": "article", "description": "At a press conference in North Philadelphia, lawmakers called the island's debt situation 'a humanitarian crisis.'", "title": "PA For Puerto Rico Join National Coalition To Pressure Lawmakers To Take Action On Island's Debt Crisis"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/pa-for-puerto-rico.jpg?w=1280", "description": "At a press conference in North Philadelphia, lawmakers called the island's debt situation 'a humanitarian crisis.'", "site": "CBSphilly", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "PA For Puerto Rico Join National Coalition To Pressure Lawmakers To Take Action On Island's Debt Crisis"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Philly's Top Spots", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Philly", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly"}, "keywords": "heard on, local, news, pennsylvania, cherri gregg, puerto rico", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/40f9fbf792243f0932e0cab4dbd46d10?s=16", "news_keywords": "cherri gregg, puerto rico"}, "article_summary": "PHILADELPHIA (CBS) \u2014 A new coalition\u2013 Pennsylvania for Puerto Rico\u2013 is joining a national effort calling for federal action to aid the cash-strapped US territory.\n\u201cLet Puerto Rico decide its fate,\u201d says Pa State Representative Angel Cruz.\nFor more on Pennsylvania for Puerto Rico (#PA4PR), contact the Hispanic Federation at info@hispanicfederation.org.\nMired in more than 72-billion dollars in debt, jobs are becoming scarce in Puerto Rico with roughly half of the island\u2019s population living below the poverty line.\nQuiones-Sanchez and others claim the Hispanic Caucus supported President Obama in the passage of the Affordable Care Act with the understanding there would be equity for Puerto Rico."}
