Carson pointed out that in some states you can make as much money or more on government assistance than minimum wage. He added that he \u201cdidn\u2019t necessarily blame\u201d people who, given that calculation stayed home, but they should recognize the importance of work experience. Harwood then asked Carson about the minimum wage, to which Carson responded, \u201cI, think, probably, it should be higher.\u201d\n\nCarson then touted health savings accounts as a replacement to Obamacare and Medicare, which he argued would grant much greater flexibility.\n\nHarwood then asked about Carson\u2019s statement where he compared President Obama to a psychopath, Carson clarified that he wasn\u2019t calling the president a psychopath, but merely that he \u201creminds you of a psychopath\u201d because \u201cthey tend to be extremely smooth, charming people people, who can tell a lie to your face with complete, it looks like sincerity, even though they know it\u2019s a lie.\u201d Harwood followed up, asking Carson if he thinks the president is a liar. Carson responded, \u201cI think he knows full well, the unemployment rate is not 5.5%. He knows that. He knows that people who are not well-informed will swallow it hook, line, and sinker.\u201d\n\nThe discussion concluded by going back to Baltimore. Carson argued that the biggest problem in cities like Baltimore is economics, not racism. He added that \u201cracism still exists in our society\u2026amongst particularly liberals, who think that if you\u2019re black, you have to think a certain way.\u201d\n\n(h/t The Hill)\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson advocated for a higher minimum wage", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson advocated for a higher minimum wage", "title": "Carson: Minimum Wage 'Should Be Higher' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/carson.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-05-08T12:02:41-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/05/08/carson-minimum-wage-should-be-higher/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson advocated for a higher minimum wage", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/carson.jpg", "title": "Carson: Minimum Wage 'Should Be Higher' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Baltimore, Ben Carson, minimum wage, obamacare,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV, Economics,Carson", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-05-08T11:09:02-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-05-08T12:02:41-07:00", "tag": "obamacare", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Carson pointed out that in some states you can make as much money or more on government assistance than minimum wage.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERRepublican presidential candidate Ben Carson advocated for a higher minimum wage in an interview with CNBC Chief Washington Correspondent John Harwood on his \u201cSpeakeasy\u201d series.\nHarwood then asked Carson about the minimum wage, to which Carson responded, \u201cI, think, probably, it should be higher.\u201dCarson then touted health savings accounts as a replacement to Obamacare and Medicare, which he argued would grant much greater flexibility.\nCarson responded, \u201cI think he knows full well, the unemployment rate is not 5.5%.\nCarson argued that the biggest problem in cities like Baltimore is economics, not racism."}
