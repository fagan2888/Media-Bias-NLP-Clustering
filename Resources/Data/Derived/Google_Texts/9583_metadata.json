The name of the program roughly translates to \u201cSafe Capital.\u201d\n\nRelated: Putin\u2019s Shiny New Tank Breaks Down\n\nThe program is expected to begin within the next few weeks, and will at first be limited to between 500 and 700 volunteers patrolling only one night a week. They will wear uniforms identifying them as members of United Russia Party, and among other things will be given the task of creating a \u201ccrime map\u201d of Moscow.\n\nThis will not be the first private group patrolling the capital\u2019s streets, according to the Moscow Times. Earlier this year, existing Cossack groups announced that they would begin hunting for draft dodgers in Moscow, and since the beginning of the year have been patrolling public parks in concert with the police to crack down on public intoxication and petty crime.\n\nThey will, however, be the first such organization with the explicit backing of the country\u2019s largest political party. United Russia, and Putin, are both supported by a majority of the Russian people. That popularity has remained resilient in the face of international sanctions imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula last year, and then increased in the face of Russia\u2019s continued support of armed rebellion in Eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe Kommersant story quoted an unidentified member of United Russia as saying that it was not out of the question that the new group could be used to monitor opposition rallies in Moscow.\n\nRelated: Putin Accused of Having Thousands of Troops in Ukraine\n\nThere is a long and sordid history in Europe of political parties, often Fascist in nature, creating their own paramilitary organizations to enforce public order and suppress political dissent. Ironically, Russia only last weekend celebrated the defeat of the most infamous such movement to get its start with help from a volunteer militia: the Nazi Party.\n\nIn its early years, the Nazi Party relied on its legions of \u201cbrownshirts\u201d to disrupt rival political rallies and intimidate opponents and groups seen as undesirable. Mussolini\u2019s blackshirts played a related role in fascist Italy, as, to a lesser degree, did the Falangist militias in Franco\u2019s nationalist movement in Spain.\n\nWhile Putin and others in leadership positions in Russia reflexively condemn fascism in particular \u2013 one of Putin\u2019s main talking points when criticizing the government in Ukraine is his claim that it has allied itself with fascists \u2013 it\u2019s a term more and more frequently applied to his own regime.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The United Russia Party will assemble squads of \u201cathletic\u201d men pulled from private security firms, military associations, and Russia\u2019s famed Cossacks, to patrol Moscow on Friday nights with the aim of reducing petty crime, illegal parking, drug sales, and unspecified violations of public order.", "title": "Putin Turns to Volunteer Vigilantes to Patrol Moscow", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/14/Putin-Turns-Volunteer-Vigilantes-Patrol-Moscow", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Putin-Batman-Suit.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/14/Putin-Turns-Volunteer-Vigilantes-Patrol-Moscow", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Putin-Batman-Suit.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The United Russia Party will assemble squads of \u201cathletic\u201d men pulled from private security firms, military associations, and Russia\u2019s famed Cossacks, to patrol Moscow on Friday nights with the aim of reducing petty crime, illegal parking, drug sales, and unspecified violations of public order.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b89\"", "article_summary": "They will, however, be the first such organization with the explicit backing of the country\u2019s largest political party.\nThey will wear uniforms identifying them as members of United Russia Party, and among other things will be given the task of creating a \u201ccrime map\u201d of Moscow.\nUnited Russia, and Putin, are both supported by a majority of the Russian people.\nThis will not be the first private group patrolling the capital\u2019s streets, according to the Moscow Times.\nThe Kommersant story quoted an unidentified member of United Russia as saying that it was not out of the question that the new group could be used to monitor opposition rallies in Moscow."}
