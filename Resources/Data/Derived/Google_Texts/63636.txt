Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton has picked up another Illinois superdelegate.

State Sen. James Clayborne, of Downstate Belleville, has endorsed the former secretary of state. Clayborne is the Illinois Senate majority leader and also a member of the Democratic National Committee, which makes him a superdelegate to the national nominating convention in Philadelphia.

“After careful consideration, it’s become clear to me that no other candidate will fight harder to advance the interests of my constituents and break down the barriers that hold them back than Hillary Clinton,” Clayborne said in a statement.

Clinton so far has amassed 1,052 delegates and superdelegates to 427 for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, according to a New York Times estimate. A total of 2,383 is needed to secure the Democratic nomination.

Sanders is scheduled to speak Friday at a rally at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville, near St. Louis. The Missouri primary is March 15, the same day as the Illinois primary. (Rick Pearson)

From the notebook

*Durbin backs Foxx: Cook County state's attorney challenger Kim Foxx notched another endorsement Thursday, this one from U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin.

“Between her 12 years as a prosecutor and her time championing progressive reforms, Kim Foxx is more than ready to lead the state’s attorney’s office and restore faith in our justice system,” Durbin said.

The two will campaign Friday morning at the Metra station under Millennium Park.

Foxx is challenging two-term State's Attorney Anita Alvarez in the March 15 Democratic primary. Former prosecutor Donna More also is in the high-profile contest. (Hal Dardick)

*Rotering up with new TV ad in IL-10: Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering, vying for the Democratic nomination in the North Shore 10th Congressional District, is up with a new ad.

The commercial is an attempt to contrast the differences on access to health care between Rotering and her rival for the nomination, former U.S. Rep. Brad Schneider, of Deerfield.

Rotering’s ad tries to lump Schneider in with congressional Republicans, contending he voted against President Barack Obama “more than most Democrats in Congress.” It cites a Congressional Quarterly review contending Schneider voted against the president 37 percent of the time.
