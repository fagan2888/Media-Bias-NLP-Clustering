However, he also questioned the decision, stating that the decision contradicts the stated purpose of Obama\u2019s opposition, which was to avoid contributing to so-called anthropogenic climate change.\n\n\u201cWell, first of all, it could be mythical. With oil prices so low, they might never build it anyway,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cSo, it really doesn\u2019t matter at some level. But pretending it matters, I do think it\u2019s an anti-environmental, anti-science move. His State Department and many other experts decided, if the oil is going to come out of the sands, it\u2019s a lot cleaner to have it go through the pipeline than to put on trains or trucks and send it over to China through ships that way. And, so, if the oil comes out of the sands, which it\u2019s going to do if it makes economic sense, we might as well do it in the cleanest way possible. So, to me, this is just a political decision to placate some people who he\u2019s offended with some of his other decisions.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brooks: Obama Keystone XL Decision 'an Anti-Environmental, Anti-Science Move'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Brooks: Obama Keystone XL Decision 'an Anti-Environmental, Anti-Science Move'", "title": "Brooks: Obama Keystone XL Decision 'an Anti-Environmental, Anti-Science Move' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 532, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Brooks117.jpg", "height": 399}, "updated_time": "2015-11-07T06:26:50-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/11/07/brooks-obama-keystone-xl-decision-an-anti-environmental-anti-science-move/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brooks: Obama Keystone XL Decision 'an Anti-Environmental, Anti-Science Move'", "creator": "@jeff_poor", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/Brooks117.jpg", "title": "Brooks: Obama Keystone XL Decision 'an Anti-Environmental, Anti-Science Move' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, David Brooks, Keystone XL, PBS NewsHour,Breitbart TV, Environment,Brooks", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-11-07T06:26:28-07:00", "section": "Breitbart TV", "modified_time": "2015-11-07T06:26:50-07:00", "tag": "PBS NewsHour", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Environment"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "With oil prices so low, they might never build it anyway,\u201d Brooks said.\nHowever, he also questioned the decision, stating that the decision contradicts the stated purpose of Obama\u2019s opposition, which was to avoid contributing to so-called anthropogenic climate change.\nBut pretending it matters, I do think it\u2019s an anti-environmental, anti-science move.\nSo, to me, this is just a political decision to placate some people who he\u2019s offended with some of his other decisions.\u201dFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor\nAnd, so, if the oil comes out of the sands, which it\u2019s going to do if it makes economic sense, we might as well do it in the cleanest way possible."}
