Connecticut decided Friday.\n\nThough ObamaCare is federal law, governors and insurance commissioners must allow providers to make the exceptions because insurance is regulated differently in each state.\n\nObama in touting his sweeping health-care reform law before signing it in 2010 told Americans they could keep their existing insurance plans if they liked them.\n\nHowever, many of those plans do not meet the law's new standards, which has resulted in millions of cancellation notices being mailed out over the past few months and the president announcing his proposed solution.\n\n\"We are not going to gut this law,\" Obama said during a speech in Cleveland. \"We will fix what needs to be fixed, but we're going to make the Affordable Care Act work.\"\n\nThis is not the first so-called fix the president has proposed, starting with him putting a one-year delay on the ObamaCare mandate that small businesses provide insurance to employees, to allow owners to sort through the complex paperwork.\n\nAnd the White House this week extended the enrollment deadline after the disastrous Oct. 1 rollout of the healthcare.gov website.\n\nOfficials said Friday they would extend the Dec. 15 deadline to Dec. 23 for insurance coverage that kicks in Jan 1. Those who fail to enroll by March 15 face a tax penalty.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, last week rejected the offer, saying his state exchange is working well and the state-run website has not had the technical glitches like the federal site.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns among state officials is that allowing residents to wait a year will make the overall ObamaCare situation worse because the young, healthy people needed to enroll and cover the cost of the elderly and other more costly customers will indeed wait.\n\nMinnesota Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton and other governors reportedly said no to the Obama offer over concerns it would destabilize their states insurance markets and result in higher premiums for too many residents.\n\nOn Thursday, California\u2019s health insurance exchange voted unanimously against the proposal.\n\nThe Covered California Board of Directors decided instead to stick with its approach of phasing out the non-compliant policies by year\u2019s end, saying Obama\u2019s request that insurers let Americans keep those plans through 2014 will not help consumers in the end.\n\n\u201cThe board cited that extending the deadline offers no benefit to the consumer and may create confusion about accessing affordable health care coverage through Covered California,\u201d it said in a press release.\n\nHowever, at least a dozen states have agreed to the proposal or were already allowing insurers to let customers renew existing plans.\n\nAmong them are Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon and Texas. Roughly another 20 states have yet to decide.\n\nThe other major factor is whether insurance companies will comply.\n\nNorth Carolina Blue Cross Blue Shield and Florida Blue have agreed but Blue Cross Blue Shield Alabama did not.\n\nThe Alabama group said Wednesday that temporarily reinstating out-of-compliance policies would \u201cdestabilize\u201d the state\u2019s insurance market and that \u201cthe ultimate impact would be higher healthcare costs for all of our customers, now and in the near future.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/STATE AND
