This time it\u2019s over attaching controversial policy riders to an omnibus appropriations bill that would keep the government open beyond the December 11 deadline.\n\nWhile the budget deal set the topline numbers for fiscal year 2016, Congress must still craft an all-encompassing measure that details funding levels for government agencies before the current short-term spending bill runs out.\n\nRelated: Can Paul Ryan Turn Around the Party of No?\n\nOn Tuesday, newly elected House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) struck an ambiguous tone about the use of potentially controversial riders with the must-pass spending legislation.\n\nA rider on any number of issues -- such as defunding Planned Parenthood, repealing parts of Obamacare, or blocking the president\u2019s environmental changes -- could jeopardize the omnibus and risk causing a government shutdown.\n\n\u201cThis is the legislative branch and the power of the purse rests within the legislative branch, and we fully expect that we're going to exercise that power,\u201d he said during his first press conference as speaker.\n\nWhile Ryan didn\u2019t elaborate, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) interpreted his remarks as a \u201cbouquet\u201d to the House Freedom Caucus. The hardline group, whose demands about spending \u2013 most recently eliminating federal dollars for Planned Parenthood \u2013 helped drive Ryan\u2019s predecessor, John Boehner, into early retirement.\n\n\u201cThe power of the purse doesn't give Republicans the right to hold government hostage unless we repeal Dodd-Frank or de-fund Planned Parenthood. We're not going to let that happen. We're not,\u201d Reid said during a Capitol Hill press conference.\n\nRelated: Here's How GOP Hardliners Could Still Blow Up the Budget Deal\n\nDemocrats are \u201cnot looking for any riders,\u201d he added, a statement that could come back to haunt Reid as negotiations move forward.\n\nPresident Obama is insisting on a \u201cclean\u201d government funding bill and threatened to veto any legislation that doesn\u2019t pass his party\u2019s litmus test.\n\n\u201cMy suspicion is that Speaker Ryan doesn't want to preside over government shutdown six weeks after getting his new job,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. \u201cSo we continue to have a lot of confidence that \u2026 as Congress works to implement the budget agreement that the president just signed into law yesterday, that they'll continue to work in a bipartisan spirit that will allow the government to remain open.\u201d\n\nRelated: The New Budget Deal Is Washington Vote Buying at Its Finest\n\nObama isn\u2019t taking any chances, though, meeting with the top Democrats on the House and Senate appropriations committees at the White House on Tuesday to go over strategy.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who has vowed that there would be \u201cno more government shutdowns\u201d on his watch, seemed to take Ryan\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cRiders in appropriations bills are quite common. The Democrats will have some, too. Of course, there will be some riders in the appropriation bills. I'm having a hard time remembering [any] that didn't,\u201d he told reporters during a press conference.\n\nAsked if that included a rider to zero out Planned Parenthood funding, the issue that helped prompt the spending fight, McConnell said lawmakers would \u201cnegotiate all of that through the appropriations committee process.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Days after coming together to approve a sweeping two-year budget agreement, congressio", "title": "Paul Ryan Sends a Signal to the GOP\u2019s Right Wing", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/04/Paul-Ryan-Sends-Signal-GOP-s-Right-Wing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-congress-ryan_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/04/Paul-Ryan-Sends-Signal-GOP-s-Right-Wing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-congress-ryan_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Days after coming together to approve a sweeping two-year budget agreement, congressio", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf2d2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe power of the purse doesn't give Republicans the right to hold government hostage unless we repeal Dodd-Frank or de-fund Planned Parenthood.\n\u201cMy suspicion is that Speaker Ryan doesn't want to preside over government shutdown six weeks after getting his new job,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said.\nOn Tuesday, newly elected House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) struck an ambiguous tone about the use of potentially controversial riders with the must-pass spending legislation.\nThe hardline group, whose demands about spending \u2013 most recently eliminating federal dollars for Planned Parenthood \u2013 helped drive Ryan\u2019s predecessor, John Boehner, into early retirement.\nA rider on any number of issues -- such as defunding Planned Parenthood, repealing parts of Obamacare, or blocking the president\u2019s environmental changes -- could jeopardize the omnibus and risk causing a government shutdown."}
