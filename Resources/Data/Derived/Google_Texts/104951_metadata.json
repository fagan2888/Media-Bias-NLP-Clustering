CNN how scheduled a quickie town hall Sunday night in Iowa to give Clinton another opportunity to make her appeal to the white Democrats rapidly fleeing from her support base.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fighting it out in Iowa. We\u2019ve got a little lead that I think is solidifying and maybe growing a little bit. We\u2019re on a home-field disadvantage here\u201d in New Hampshire, Clinton said.\n\nThough Sanders is from the neighboring state of Vermont, Hillary still won the New Hampshire primary in 2008.\n\n\u201cIf you elect Hillary president, it will be a great day when you stop her from defunding Planned Parenthood,\u201d said Bill Clinton. \u201cHillary Clinton does not consider Planned Parenthood a member of the establishment.\u201d\n\nClinton called Bernie Sanders\u2019 health care plan a \u201crecipe for gridlock.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn health care, Hillary thinks we should remember how important the Affordable Care Act is. Her opponent says, no, we should scrap that and go into a single-payer system,\u201d Clinton said, defending Obamacare against Sanders\u2019 plan.\n\nAs Sanders attacks Hillary for her Wall Street donations and coziness with Goldman Sachs, the Clintons are struggling to regain control of the party they once dominated.\n\nTellingly, Hillary Clinton praised President Obama in the last debate numerous times, leading Donald Trump to suggest that Hillary was doing so in order to suck up to the White House to avoid being indicted for her private email use.\n\n\u201cShe wants to stay out of the clink, that\u2019s why,\u201d Trump said in Tulsa to an approximately 150-times bigger crowd than the one Clinton spoke to. \u201cEvery single thing, oh she thinks the president is wonderful. She never thought the president was wonderful before. She couldn\u2019t stand him, and frankly he couldn\u2019t stand her\u2026She wants to make it through this thing, and he has the power of the presidency.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bill Clinton Attacks Bernie Sanders In Front of Tiny Crowd In New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Bill Clinton Attacks Bernie Sanders In Front of Tiny Crowd In New Hampshire", "title": "Bill Clinton Attacks Bernie Sanders In Front of Tiny Crowd In New Hampshire - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Bill-Clinton-Getty.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-01-20T18:47:31-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/20/bill-clinton/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bill Clinton Attacks Bernie Sanders In Front of Tiny Crowd In New Hampshire", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Bill-Clinton-Getty.jpg", "title": "Bill Clinton Attacks Bernie Sanders In Front of Tiny Crowd In New Hampshire - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bill Clinton Attacks Bernie Sanders In Front of Tiny Crowd In New Hampshire", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-01-20T18:38:57-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2016-01-20T18:47:31-07:00", "tag": "Bill Clinton", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Hillary Clinton"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Clinton, stumping for wife Hillary, took aim at Bernie Sanders, whose staggering 27-point lead over Hillary Clinton in the Granite State has fundamentally changed the Democratic race.\nWe\u2019re on a home-field disadvantage here\u201d in New Hampshire, Clinton said.\n\u201cIf you elect Hillary president, it will be a great day when you stop her from defunding Planned Parenthood,\u201d said Bill Clinton.\n\u201cHillary Clinton does not consider Planned Parenthood a member of the establishment.\u201dClinton called Bernie Sanders\u2019 health care plan a \u201crecipe for gridlock.\u201d\u201cOn health care, Hillary thinks we should remember how important the Affordable Care Act is.\nThough Sanders is from the neighboring state of Vermont, Hillary still won the New Hampshire primary in 2008."}
