This decision has positive implications for other tribes recognized by the federal government after 1934.\n\nThough Monday's signing was 16 years in the making, we Cowlitz have been without reservation land for over 160 years. Many generations have passed waiting for this day.\n\n\u201cAfter 160 years of longing for a Reservation within our aboriginal lands, I welcome all Cowlitz people to come home!\u201d Cowlitz Chair Bill Iyall exclaimed to a rapt audience, \u201cWe are no longer a landless tribe.\u201d\n\nWe always knew this reservation land was ours, and the government and Federal Court agreed. \u201cThe new reservation will offer opportunities for our Tribal people and the wider community, says Iyall, \u201cit will benefit the citizens of Clark County, because it stands to benefit all citizens. Our neighbors recognize it, and in the future our children will benefit, the families and communities will benefit, as the Tribe continues to grow in influence, scope, and services.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet's get this signed!\u201d smiled Cowlitz Spiritual Leader, Tanna Engdahl, and Chairman Iyall quipped as he laid ink to paper, \u201cI'll be keeping this pen!\u201d Smiles abounded, but there were few dry eyes in the house. Lucky enough to be in attendance, I know this day was long in the making and many Cowlitz people who gave years of time and effort to make it happen did not live to see the moment. They were there in spirit, though, each and everyone one, pulling in close and standing by.\n\nChristine Dupres, Cowlitz/Cree, Ph.D., is the author of Being Cowlitz: How One Tribe Renewed and Sustained Its Identity (University of Washington Press 2014).", "article_metadata": {"description": "On March 9, the Bureau of Indian Affairs Regional Director Stanley Speaks signed the final documents to establish the Cowlitz Indian Tribe\u2019s Reservation, to an audience of Cowlitz elders and tribal leaders.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Christine Dupres"}}, "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/03/cowlitz-indian-tribe-gets-our-reservation", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/author_thumbnail_medium/public/author/screen_shot_2015-02-20_at_10.17.52_am.png?itok=rYByF-cS", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Cowlitz Indian Tribe Gets Our Reservation"}, "dcterms.date": "2015-04-03T08:00-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/04/03/cowlitz-indian-tribe-gets-our-reservation", "dc": {"title": "Cowlitz Indian Tribe Gets Our Reservation"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.creator": "mazecyrus", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Christine Dupres, Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA, Stanley Speaks, Cowlitz", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "Cowlitz Indian Tribe Gets Our Reservation"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd001b\"", "article_summary": "On March 9, the Bureau of Indian Affairs Regional Director Stanley Speaks signed the final documents to establish the Cowlitz Indian Tribe\u2019s Reservation, to an audience of Cowlitz elders and tribal leaders.\nA court decision issued by United States District Court Judge Barbara Rothstein on December 12, 2014 dismissed the appeal by the Cowlitz Indian Tribe\u2019s opponent\u2019s and reaffirmed the Federal Government\u2019s decision to take 152 acres in Clark County into trust for the Cowlitz Indian Tribe.\nThough Monday's signing was 16 years in the making, we Cowlitz have been without reservation land for over 160 years.\nChristine Dupres, Cowlitz/Cree, Ph.D., is the author of Being Cowlitz: How One Tribe Renewed and Sustained Its Identity (University of Washington Press 2014).\n\u201cAfter 160 years of longing for a Reservation within our aboriginal lands, I welcome all Cowlitz people to come home!\u201d Cowlitz Chair Bill Iyall exclaimed to a rapt audience, \u201cWe are no longer a landless tribe.\u201dWe always knew this reservation land was ours, and the government and Federal Court agreed."}
