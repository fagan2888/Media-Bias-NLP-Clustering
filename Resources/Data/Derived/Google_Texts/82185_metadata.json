It ranked fifth on the \u201copportunity and competition\u201d measure (wages and opportunities) and 13th on the work \u201cwork environment\u201d measure (working condition). At the other end of the spectrum, Louisiana respectively ranked 46th and 50th on both measures.\n\nBeyond these measures, the ranking also included several interviews with experts in nursing to inquire about the future of their profession, including the effects of the Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamacare\u201d) on their profession. Some contend that this law will improve their profession, not only because the increased demand for care resulting from patients living longer, but because of the increased enrollees through the ACA.\n\nProfessor G. Rumay Alexander of UNC-Chapel Hill says, \u201cThe increase in patient populations makes the case for efficiency of scales and using all providers to the fullest scope of practice.\u201d Her colleague from NYU\u2019s College of Nursing Christine Kovner shares the same thoughts, adding that more efficient nurses \u201cwill be really important to meet the increase in demand for health care services.\u201d Nurse practitioners, in particular, can act as primary-care physicians at a much lower cost that the classical physician.\n\nStill about cost saving, Dean of the School of Nursing at Johns Hopkins University Patricia Davidson sees opportunities for nurses in home care since the \u201cACA also aims to keep patients out of hospital and in their communities.\u201d\n\nAssociate Professor at Creighton University College Linda Lazure has a similar perception of her profession \u201cif barriers to practice can be surmounted.\u201d And these barriers are still numerous since \u201cstates have found ways to still limit practice\u201d for nurses says Lori Lioce of the University of Alabama Huntsville.\n\nIf Massachusetts, which passed something similar to the ACA 10 years ago, is any indication, getting actual health care will be difficult since \u201cthe law didn\u2019t create an infrastructure,\u201d said Dr. David John, chief of emergency care at Caritas Carney Hospital in Boston. So while there were more patients, there weren\u2019t more doctors \u2013 half of the family medicine practices were already full in 2011.\n\nNurses were affected too. Associate Professor at Boston College Judith Shindul-Rothschild co-authored research showing that, despite a substantial increase in patient admission, nurse hiring did not keep pace. As a result, their work load increased so much that \u201cthe Massachusetts Nurses Association was poised to have a ballot question [in] 2014 limiting the number of patients that could be assigned to registered nurses in hospitals.\u201d\n\nShe predicts a similar outcome in states where hiring doesn\u2019t keep up to pace with increased patient admission.\n\nThe future of nursing is greatly dependent on government policies. While the ACA has the ability to create more opportunities for nurses, they still have to overcome the obstacles of a physician-centered system that doesn\u2019t give them more tasks, and will have to be careful about burning out since patient admission usually increases faster than personnel hiring.\n\nThis article was written by a contributor of Watchdog Arena, Franklin Center\u2019s network of writers, bloggers, and citizen journalists.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "In a new report on the nursing field, nursing experts talk about the opportunities and challenges they face due to Obamacare.", "title": "Obamacare presents challenges and opportunities for nurses in 2015 - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/shutterstock_56319274.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-15T10:58:39+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/219125/nurses-week-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Watchdog Arena", "tag": "Affordable Care Act,National Nurses Week,nurses,ObamaCare", "published_time": "2015-05-15T10:57:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-15T10:58:39+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "In a new report on the nursing field, nursing experts talk about the opportunities and challenges they face due to Obamacare.", "title": "Obamacare presents challenges and opportunities for nurses in 2015 - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/05/shutterstock_56319274.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "In a new report on the nursing field, nursing experts talk about the opportunities and challenges they face due to Obamacare."}, "article_summary": "It ranked fifth on the \u201copportunity and competition\u201d measure (wages and opportunities) and 13th on the work \u201cwork environment\u201d measure (working condition).\nBy PG Veer | Watchdog ArenaThe health care industry has undergone major changes over the years, and with National Nurses Week 2015 just behind us, nurses will have to step up their game, according to experts.\nThe ranking crowned Washington State as the best overall environment for nurses.\nThis article was written by a contributor of Watchdog Arena, Franklin Center\u2019s network of writers, bloggers, and citizen journalists.\nSo while there were more patients, there weren\u2019t more doctors \u2013 half of the family medicine practices were already full in 2011."}
