Bernie Sanders \u2014an open and sincere socialist drawing huge crowds as he seeks the Democratic nomination\u2014should push conservatives to criticize \u201ccrony capitalism,\u201d GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cIf you look at all these gigantic pieces of legislation\u2013Dodd-Frank to pick one, Obamacare to pick another\u2013the big and the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected do well and the small and the powerless get crushed,\u201d she told Breitbart.\n\n\u201cWe have to make this case. We have to explain it. We have to tell the story. We can\u2019t just say \u2018We\u2019re going to run out of money,'\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPeople think the game is rigged now. That\u2019s what all the polling data says. And so, first, part of Bernie Sanders\u2019 appeal is at least he\u2019s authentic. At least \u2018He\u2019s always said this,'\u201d Fiorina told Breitbart News. Sanders is authentic, she said, because he \u201chas said exactly the same things for 30 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople have figured out that politics has become a big game and that a lot of politicians, frankly on both sides of the aisle, say whatever needs to be said at the time but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re actually going to do it,\u201d Fiorina told Breitbart.\n\nSanders\u2019 authenticity makes a stark contrast with leading Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton. Clinton has always struggled to seem natural and has frequently flip-flopped on big issues, most recently on her prior support for the unpopular Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade deal.\n\nBecause Sanders comes across as authentic and honest, Fiorina said, Republicans need to work overtime to explain to Americans that socialism\u2014bigger, more complex government\u2014is not a solution to the problem. And that explanation can\u2019t begin and end with \u201cWe can\u2019t afford it\u201d so long as people believe there are rich people who are not paying \u201ctheir fair share,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPeople may or may not believe that, especially if they believe the rich need to pay their fair share, whatever that\u2019s defined as\u2026 If you say to people, which I do all the time, let\u2019s think about who benefits when government is big and powerful and complicated and costly. Who benefited from every thing from a zero interest rate to these big massive pieces of regulation and legislation? The answer is the big, the powerful, the wealthy and the well-connected. Retirees, young people who are trying to save, middle-class folks who are hurt by zero interest rates. The investor class does great in it because investments whether it\u2019s in the stock market or the real estate market do well.\u201d\n\nFiorina said she regularly engages with Democrats and independents fascinated with the Sanders phenomenon on the campaign trail\u2014and she does her best to get them to think about who really benefits from larger government. \u201cI have many Democrats and independents that now come to my events,\u201d Fiorina said.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of Bernie Sanders\u2019 people who come and I ask them why and they say it\u2019s because you talk about crony capitalism. So they know that\u2019s bad, but of course what progressives do is they say the answer to crony capitalism is more big government, which is exactly the wrong answer. I say to people, ask yourself a question, if something is so complicated, like a 73,000 page tax code or the rules around Obamacare\u2013if something is so complicated [that] you don\u2019t understand it, what do you suppose the chances are that you\u2019re getting taken advantage of? And people in their bones get that.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to entitlement reform for programs like Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare and more\u2014and changing the way government operates, generally\u2014Fiorina said that she believes it\u2019s important those seeking to make such changes understand that the American people don\u2019t trust government and trust politicians running it even less.\n\n\u201cI think you start by acknowledging that no one trusts that we can deal with anything big and important anymore. Gallup has asked the question for 20 years, \u2018do you think the federal government is corrupt?\u2019 Seventy-five percent of the American people now say yes. Eighty-two percent now say we have a professional political class that\u2019s more consumed with its own power, privilege and position than getting anything done. Well, if that\u2019s where the American people are, that they\u2019ve lost faith in their political process, their politicians and their government, you can\u2019t tackle these big things until you prove, you demonstrate, you rebuild their confidence that our political system and our government can work.\u201d\n\nShe said because of that loss of trust, she would first reform basic government spending and appropriations\u2014prioritizing those ahead of other more central programs\u2014to earn trust of the public back.\n\n\u201cSo I wouldn\u2019t start with entitlements and what do you do with 70 percent of our spending. I would start with something basic like appropriations and what we do with 30 percent of our spending. Because we never talk about the whole budget. Government has spent more money each and every year for about 50 years under Republicans and Democrats alike and it never has enough money to do anything important. It wastes tens of billions, hundreds of billions of dollars, so I think we have to start with the basics, we have to go to zero-based budgeting, we have to have some consequence for failure to perform, we have to ask agencies to justify every dollar every year, we have to have sunset provisions, we have to get some basic competence back in government. And then, by the way, there are loads of great conservative ideas about how to reform Social Security. Cato has written them. The American Enterprise Institute has written them. Heritage has written them. It\u2019s not that we lack for good ideas, it\u2019s that nobody actually does it. And the American people won\u2019t trust that we can do it competently until we get our house in order.\u201d\n\nYou can read part 1 of Breitbart News\u2019 exclusive interview with Carly Fiorina here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Exclusive \u2014 Carly Fiorina: GOP Should Hammer 'Crony Capitalism'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Exclusive \u2014 Carly Fiorina: GOP Should Hammer 'Crony Capitalism'", "title": "Exclusive \u2014 Carly Fiorina: GOP Should Hammer 'Crony Capitalism' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Fiorina-fist-Rex-Features-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-10-13T12:31:34-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/13/exclusive-carly-fiorina-gop-hammer-crony-capitalism/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Exclusive \u2014 Carly Fiorina: GOP Should Hammer 'Crony Capitalism'", "creator": "@verumserum", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Fiorina-fist-Rex-Features-AP.jpg", "title": "Exclusive \u2014 Carly Fiorina: GOP Should Hammer 'Crony Capitalism' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bernie Sanders, Carly Fiorina,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Cronyism,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-10-13T10:16:16-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-10-13T12:31:34-07:00", "tag": "Carly Fiorina", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Cronyism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca173\"", "article_summary": "At least \u2018He\u2019s always said this,'\u201d Fiorina told Breitbart News.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe phenomenon of Vermont Sen.
