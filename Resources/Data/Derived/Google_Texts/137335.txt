The split between labor unions and the Obama administration may dampen the Labor Day celebrations of congressional Democrats, who are struggling to maintain their Senate majority.

Republicans are attempting to drive a wedge between union members and the Democratic Party by tying liberal candidates to President Obama’s unpopular stances on healthcare—Obamacare threatens to increase costs on union insurance plans; environmental issues—the administration has obstructed the Keystone Pipeline; and job creation—his EPA regulations threaten hundreds of thousands of coal-related jobs.

Union members make up an important piece of the liberal coalition, flooding Democrats with hundreds of millions of dollars in support, organization, and voter turn out efforts during election season. But unhappy union members and leaders may be sitting out this election cycle. The Washington Post reported in January that “a number of angry labor officials say their members are far less likely to campaign and turn out for Democratic candidates in the midterm elections. In March, the Hill reported that “Other union leaders plan to withhold resources from Democrats caught in competitive Senate races, saying they want hold their allies accountable for past actions.”

The Washington Free Beacon highlighted the tensions between Democrats and union members heading into the midterm election in 2013. The discontent not only led to public breaks with the administration, but internal rebellion from prominent labor groups.
