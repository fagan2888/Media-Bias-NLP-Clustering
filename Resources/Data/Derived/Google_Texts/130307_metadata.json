With GE\u2019s expertise in healthcare and Intel\u2019s expertise in technology \u2013 we\u2019re innovating to change the way care and solutions are delivered.\n\nWhile Silicon Valley has become a renowned hub for some of the world\u2019s high-tech Fortune 500 companies, Chicago has its own microcosm of burgeoning startups, accelerators and investors all focused on senior care innovation.\n\nThe number of digital companies making the Windy City their mission control has grown 255% from just 38 in 2007 to 135 startups launching in 2012, according to an infographic from Built in Chicago, an online social community that tracks startup activity in the city. In 2011 alone, 193 tech companies jumped onto the scene.\n\nOne of those companies finding its start that year was Caremerge, a communication and care coordination platform for senior living. Using a set of integrated mobile and solutions, Caremerge connects nurses, doctors, senior living staff and families to facilitate timely care decisions for their loved residing in senior care communities.\n\nThe company\u2019s chief executive officer and co-founder Asif Khan, who has a nearly 13-year background in healthcare IT along with leadership roles in various GE businesses, developing the technology was personal. He came to the realization that such a communication platform was necessary for long-term care (LTC) by learning from experiences with his mother, a long-term care community resident.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just technology that was needed, but rather integrated tech that could be embedded into staff workloads that was easy to use.\n\n\u201cA minimum wage staff might not be too highly skilled and able to come up to speed on technology quickly,\u201d he says. \u201cThe technology had to be something simple so that everyone could adapt easily, like a smartphone.\u201d\n\nAfter spending much of 2011 living in all kinds of senior living facilities, spending time with nurses, activities people, food service people, and other community staff, Khan realized that the challenge of coordinating care in a 100-bed facility was that staff had to support the facility\u2019s patient population over three shifts.\n\n\u201cA lack of care coordination led to problematic situations,\u201d he says. \u201cSay somebody has fallen in the middle of the night, you have to capture that information. If the community\u2019s executive director is sleeping at 2 a.m., staff might have a difficult time contacting him/her until the next day.\u201d\n\nWithin the Caremerge system, all a staff member has to do is go to a resident\u2019s picture on a smartphone or tablet device that has the software and tag that the person has fallen. At that point, the community\u2019s ED and the Director of Nursing are automatically paged.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to rely on nursing aide to call them because they\u2019re automatically notified,\u201d says Khan.\n\nAs healthcare reforms stress reductions in preventable hospital readmissions, Khan sees Caremerge fitting well into the bigger healthcare picture.\n\n\u201cWith the Affordable Care Act, care coordination is at the centerpiece,\u201d he says. \u201cCaremerge answers the question of \u2018how do you keep people healthy while also allowing them to communicate with each other in a more simplistic manner?\u2019\u201d\n\nCaremerge has garnered quite a bit of buzz in the last few months, winning numerous awards and accolades, the most recent of which being named one of \u201cChicago\u2019s Top-10 Coolest Emerging Companies\u201d by the Chicago Entrepreneurial Center (CEC).\n\n\u201cThe Caremerge technology is not only about sharing clinical information, but also bringing full picture of resident to the forefront and sharing that with care providers,\u201d Khan says.\n\nThe company\u2014which has residency at 1871, Chicago\u2019s digital workspace for the city\u2019s innovative engineers, designers and startups\u2014is already experiencing a demand for its software solution.\n\nSo far, Caremerge already has clients in Illinois, Michigan, California, Dallas and Virginia and is still picking up customers along the way in Florida and Kentucky. While the company\u2019s clients vary in size, Khan says the typical providers who roll out Caremerge offer independent living, assisted living, or a combination of the three.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re growing pretty fast,\u201d says Khan. \u201cWe\u2019re signing new communities every week from smaller providers to large senior living chains.\u201d\n\nCaremerge is just one sliver of Chicago\u2019s thriving tech scene focused on senior care innovation.\n\nRecognizing the city\u2019s limitless entrepreneurial spirit, locally-based incubator Healthbox aims to bring its strategic partners together with early stage entrepreneurs, industry experts, and investors looking to break into healthcare innovation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding there\u2019s a lot of need for partners to have a platform to connect them to the healthcare industry,\u201d says Jenna Rose, director at Healthbox.\n\nWith Chicago strategic partners that include Ascension Health system, BlueCross BlueShield (BCBS) Venture Partners II, L.P., Walgreens and Sandbox Industries\u2014which exclusively manages approximately $300 million across two venture funds for BCBS Venture Partners\u2014the startup accelerator views the senior care space as an opportune area for investment.\n\n\u201cSenior care is an important strategic priority for our partners, especially as they think of changing chronic conditions and curbing healthcare costs,\u201d says Rose.\n\nHealthbox is currently in the midst of accepting applications for its second Chicago accelerator program. The program provides a broad network of mentors to offer guidance to its startup winners, as well as office space and an investment of $50,000.\n\n\u201cHealthbox is a platform that can bring together resources to enable an aspiring health tech company to perfect their product and business model.\u201d\n\nThis pooling of resources and collaboration is more valuable than a company\u2019s technology by itself, according to Caremerge\u2019s Khan.\n\n\u201cInnovation is not just one entity,\u201d he says. \u201cA whole region or sector has to come together to take it to the next level. A tech company can only do so much, but when a region comes together that\u2019s when innovation thrives.\u201d\n\nWritten by Jason Oliva", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "bluecross blueshield venture partners, caremerge, healthbox, business, finance, real estate, senior housing", "og": {"site_name": "Senior Housing News", "description": "The Innovation Series is Brought to you by Care Innovations, a joint venture between Intel Corporation and GE, committed to creating technology-based solutions that give people confidence to live independently, wherever they are.
