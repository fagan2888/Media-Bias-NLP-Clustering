With the PGA Tour in the midst of its early season West Coast swing, Tuesday evening offered a perfect opportunity for "Piers Morgan Live" to welcome one of the host's favorite guests inside his Los Angeles studio, as Bubba Watson popped by for a live interview.

But despite the fact that the 2012 Masters champ is concentrating on California and Arizona, the conversation quickly relocated to Russia, as Piers Morgan asked Watson about his Olympic interests.

"I've watched a few things, but it's so political. It used to be about athletes and great athletes," explained the Florida native. "I don't care what race, what background, I don't care what they do. Just let it be about sports, and now it's about politics. It's just sad."

On the heels of Michael Sam's public revelation that he's gay, the 35-year-old Watson questioned not necessarily the news, but more so its delivery:

"It's sad that somebody has to feel they have to come out. Like just be who you are. If that's what you want to do, if, then, be who you are. Why do you have to have a big parade or stage and come out? Like, I don't understand it. But again, I've never been gay, so I don't know what it feels like," he admitted. "I don't believe you should. But again, I've never had that feeling, so I don't know what it feels like. I don't see why we're putting them on a pedestal, and an inspiration, when they're just people like me and you trying to make a dollar and have a good living here on Earth."

Watch the clip, and listen to the interview, as Watson and Morgan toy with the idea of trading places - and salaries.
