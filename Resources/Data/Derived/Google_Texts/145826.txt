Pornhub.com

They say that when it comes to the world's high-tech habits, from free content to video streaming, the San Fernando Valley-based porn industry has led the way.

If there's a new content delivery system, xxx fans will exploit it first.

So maybe we shouldn't be surprised to learn that the website Pornhub.com is offering to help President Obama fix his disastrous Affordable Care Act website:

Don't laugh. Pornhub, part of the world's dominant online adult content company, Manwin, could probably teach the White House a thing or two about how websites are done.

The Obamacare site was useless for thousands who flocked to it in order to register and shop for coverage when the Affordable Care Act rolled out last month.

Republicans pounced on the techno failure: It has since become a huge political headache for Obama, who is vowing to fix it.

Enter Pornhub vice president Corey Price, who sent a letter to the Obama Administration offering his team's assistance. It says, in part:

As one of the largest adult entertainment websites ... Pornhub.com believes its staff of talented engineers can help prepare the Obama administration to accommodate millions of concurrent users to avoid future "tech surges."

The offer, of course, was probably more about making headlines than helping America. Still, it's a sad day when a smut company can do tech better than the White House.

Price:

It just came to me; our business is handling high traffic, we could definitely help.

At the least Pornhub can offer something to look at in an alternate browser window as the Obamacare site spins its wheels.
