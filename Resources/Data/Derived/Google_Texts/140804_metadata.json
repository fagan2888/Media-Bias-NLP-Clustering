Tell us what you think in the comments below\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C. - An Ohio case to be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court could help topple laws around the nation that make it a crime to deliberately lie about candidates during a political campaign.\n\nThe debate on whether Ohio\u2019s election law violates free speech has made unlikely allies of the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List and the abortion-rights advocate American Civil Liberties Union, and will likely pit the state of Ohio against itself in arguing over the law\u2019s constitutionality.\n\nEarlier this month, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether the Susan B. Anthony List can pursue its effort to overturn Ohio\u2019s law even though a complaint against the group was withdrawn when the candidate it targeted during the 2010 election - single-term Cincinnati-area Democratic congressman Steve Driehaus - lost his reelection.\n\nOhio State University election law expert Daniel Tokaji says the litigation \u201ccould ultimately become a really important case on false campaign speech and whether it can be regulated\u201d if the Supreme Court decides the Susan B. Anthony List has standing to challenge the law. The case will be scheduled for oral arguments this spring, with a decision expected in June.\n\nThe Susan B. Anthony List claimed the Affordable Care Act that Driehaus backed would permit taxpayer-funded abortions. Driehaus filed an Ohio Elections Commission complaint when the group tried to publicize that claim on a billboard as part of a nationwide campaign to attack Affordable Care Act backers on the issue.\n\nDriehaus and other anti-abortion Democrats supported the bill only after President Barack Obama agreed to an executive order that specified insurance plans in the health care exchanges would not use tax dollars for abortion, except in cases of rape, incest or when the life of woman would be endangered.\n\nObama\u2019s gesture did not mollify many anti-abortion groups. As the 2010 election approached, organizations like the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops insisted the health care law would still allow tax dollars to be used for abortion despite the executive order. Other anti-abortion religious groups, like the Catholic Health Association of the United States and the Leadership Conference of Women Religious said it would not, as did political fact-finding organizations like PolitiFact.\n\nDriehaus filed his complaint when the Susan B. Anthony List attempted to buy a billboard that said: \u201cShame on Steve Driehaus! Driehaus voted FOR taxpayer-funded abortion.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmong my west side constituents and my lifelong neighbors, falsely accusing me of voting for a health care reform bill that included taxpayer funding of abortions was tantamount to falsely accusing me of a heinous crime or a grievous act of corruption, in that it portrayed me to the community where I have spent my life - inaccurately - as not the person or the public official I had claimed to be,\u201d said an affidavit from Driehaus.\n\nAs it happened, the billboard never went up. The owner of the billboard decided not to accept the ad after Driehaus\u2019 lawyer threatened legal action. Legal papers later filed by Driehaus say the Susan B. Anthony List continued making the disputed claims in political mailings and a radio ad that accused Driehaus of threatening the organization with \u201ca criminal statute in a desperate attempt to silence us,\u201d and claimed he didn\u2019t want voters \u201cto know the truth.\u201d\n\nThe Susan B. Anthony List filed a federal lawsuit that challenged the Ohio election law on free speech grounds, which persisted after Driehaus withdrew his election commission complaint upon losing to Cincinnati-area Republican Steve Chabot.\n\nThe group claims Ohio\u2019s criminalization of false political speech violates First Amendment rights in a similar fashion to the Stolen Valor Act, which the Supreme Court overturned in 2012. In United States v. Alvarez, it ruled the Stolen Valor Act, which criminalized lying about receiving military honors or decorations, violated constitutional free speech rights.\n\nThe Susan B. Anthony List\u2019s appeal to to the Supreme Court says nearly a third of states have laws that prohibit \u201cfalse\u201d statements in political campaigns, and such laws insert \u201cstate bureaucrats and judges into political debates,\u201d \u201ccharging them with separating truth from oft-alleged campaign \u2018lies.\u2019\u201d It argued that laws barring \u201cfalse\u201d speech can be \u201cpoliticized, manipulated and abused, thereby causing profound harm to truthful speakers - and the entire democratic process.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch statutes are almost certainly unconstitutional, yet they play a troubling, harassing role in every political campaign in those states,\u201d said a brief the group filed with the Supreme Court. \u201cSpeakers threatened by these laws do not and will not admit that their statements are false; their concern is that their political opponents will contend otherwise, imposing litigation costs and political burdens as a penalty for the speech.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s allies in the case include the American Civil Liberties Union - which typically opposes abortion restrictions. ACLU has filed legal documents that buttress the Susan B. Anthony List\u2019s First Amendment arguments against Ohio\u2019s law.\n\n\u201cSpeech is rarely black and white - oftentimes whether a statement is true or false may be a matter of opinion,\u201d ACLU of Ohio Legal Director James Hardiman said in a press release on the case. \u201cIf the government silences one side of the debate, the public is less informed and others may be fearful of criticizing elected officials. The answer to unpopular speech is not less, but more speech.\u201d\n\nLower courts found the Susan B. Anthony List lacks legal standing to challenge the law because it wasn\u2019t prosecuted for a violation. The state of Ohio urged the Supreme Court not to consider the case because the anti-abortion group couldn\u2019t show its free speech rights were threatened, or that the commission would have prosecuted it for a violation. It also contends that because the law only bans lies, the group has no grounds to challenge the law since it insists its statements about Driehaus were truthful.\n\n\u201cThis case\u2019s unique context makes it a poor vehicle to review any broader justiciability principles,\u201d it argued.\n\nBut even as Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine defends the state law before the Supreme Court, he plans to file a separate legal brief that will challenge the law\u2019s constitutionality, as he did in a related challenge to Ohio\u2019s elections law.\n\n\u201cAn Attorney General has a special duty, as an officer of the Court and representative of the public, to acknowledge when the government\u2019s side might be wrong, and especially when a statute might be unconstitutional,\u201d said a 2012 brief he filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. The brief went onto say Ohio\u2019s law \u201cfails to provide adequate safeguards (including prompt judicial review) against the chilling of political speech.\u201d\n\nThe DeWine brief was authored by former Federal Election Commission Chairman Bradley Alan Smith, now a law school professor at Capital University in Columbus. The case involved a conservative group\u2019s claims that its social media postings about a Cincinnati ballot issue were improperly constrained by the law. The brief argued the election law harms those who want to speak out by requiring them to use time and resources responding to a complaint, and doesn\u2019t provide a timely remedy for those whose speech might be improperly curtailed by a complaint that turns out to be unfounded.\n\n\u201cOhio\u2019s machinery for policing the substance of political speech will need to be recalibrated to remove the threat of inappropriate government burdens on Ohioans who desire to speak their minds at election time,\u201d it concludes.\n\nOhio Democrats are critical of DeWine\u2019s stance in the case. Ohio Democratic Party spokesman Brian Hester says DeWine has opposed the law on free speech grounds since the Ohio Elections Commission ruled that he made false claims about his opponent\u2019s record during his successful campaign for Green County Prosecutor in the 1970s.\n\nWhen DeWine disputed those findings and mounted a legal challenge to the law, courts upheld the law\u2019s constitutionality, identifying the Commission's role in such proceedings as \"somewhat similar to that of a grand jury,\" in that it refers its conclusions to local prosecutors for action if it finds a violation occurred.\n\n\u201cIt is a very compelling state interest to promote honesty in the election of public officers,\u201d said the 1978 Ohio Court of Appeals ruling in DeWine v. Ohio Elections Commission. \u201cFreedom of speech does not include a right to purposely, with knowledge of its falsity, publish a false statement about a candidate for public office with the intent to promote the election or defeat of such candidate.\u201d\n\nDeWine\u2019s Democratic opponent in this year\u2019s contest for attorney general, former Hamilton County Commissioner and Cincinnati council member David Pepper, is also critical of DeWine\u2019s viewpoint. Pepper spokesman Peter Koltak said Pepper \u201cwould absolutely defend the long-established law that requires politicians to tell Ohio voters the truth.\u201d\n\nHester also noted that the views of Capital University\u2019s Smith, who authored DeWine\u2019s 2012 legal brief, are sufficiently controversial that they provoked an opposition campaign when Smith was a candidate to become dean of Case Western Reserve University\u2019s law school in 2011.\n\nSmith started a group called the Center for Competitive Politics to \u201cbuild a case against the regulatory system that limits individual donations to candidates, reins in the role of outside groups, and bans union and corporate contributions to political parties,\u201d in the words of a Politico article about its founding.\n\nHis biography on the group\u2019s website cites a New York Times story that called him the \u201cintellectual powerhouse\u201d of the movement to roll back campaign finance restrictions.\n\nIn a column about the upcoming Supreme Court case on the Center for Competitive Politics website, Smith argues Ohio\u2019s law \u201cmakes a sham out of the idea of due process,\u201d and that complaints made under the law are usually dropped after the the election because they\u2019ve already served their purpose of silencing critics.\n\n\u201cOhio\u2019s false statements law is much more pernicious than many realize,\u201d he says. \u201cIndeed, what\u2019s fascinating is that there is no question that the SBA List ads that prompted this suit are true, yet SBA List was still forced to defend itself before the Ohio Election Commission and had to consider the possibility of criminal penalties before speaking.\u201d\n\nDriehaus continues to claim the ads were false in a defamation case he\u2019s pursuing against the Susan B. Anthony List. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio dismissed his claim, but Driehaus has appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, arguing that the lower court\u2019s rationale for dismissing the case - that \u201cassociating a political candidate with a mainstream political position, even if false, cannot constitute defamation\u201d - has no basis in constitutional precedent.\n\n\u201cThe challenged statements are capable of defamatory meaning,\u201d says a brief from Driehaus. \u201cThey falsely made Driehaus out to be a hypocrite who abandoned his principles and his constituents by voting to spend tax dollars on abortions.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "mike-dewine,steve-driehaus,supreme-court", "title": "Should politicians have the right to lie?
