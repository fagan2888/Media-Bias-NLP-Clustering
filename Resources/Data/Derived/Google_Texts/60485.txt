Baystate Health, the largest employer in western Massachusetts, has announced a round of job cuts.

Twenty-four employees are being laid off, hours cut for 17 workers, and 45 vacant positions will go unfilled. Baystate spokesman Ben Craft said the cuts are across the board and almost all at the flagship hospital in Springfield.

"Largely support and administrative positions in both the clinical and business areas of Baystate Health. There are no physicians or bedside nurses affected. Ten management positions are included," he said.

Craft said Baystate is facing a $22 million budget gap. He said government payments to the hospital to care for the poor come up short of actual costs.

Baystate estimated it provided $112 million in care last year to people insured through Medicaid for which it was not reimbursed.

Baystate Health has a total of 11,500 employees. It owns four hospitals and operates numerous specialty care centers, physician practices, and neighborhood health clinics.
