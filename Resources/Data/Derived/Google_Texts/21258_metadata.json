(Obama has supported Common Core, and created financial incentives to adopt it. And so the right wing has turned it into another bogeyman.)\n\nAnd there is also the large and complicated federal tax code, which Huckabee wants to replace with a regressive national retail sales tax as the federal government\u2019s primary source of income.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps worth noting that if some hypothetical Huckabee supporter were to use these targets but then suffer an injury \u2014 perhaps due to a lack of proper education in the physical sciences \u2014 their medical aid would be protected by Obamacare, which might in turn help them to get a tax refund.\n\n(Hat tip Zeke Miller)", "article_metadata": {"description": "The target depicts the president's name and the \"O\" campaign logo.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The National Memo", "description": "The target depicts the president's name and the \"O\" campaign logo.", "title": "Huckabee Sells 'Obamacare' Gun Targets", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.nationalmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016-01-06-mike-huckabee-obamacare-target-640.png", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-01-06T17:49:19-04:00", "url": "http://www.nationalmemo.com/huckabee-sells-obamacare-gun-targets/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-01-06T17:29:36-04:00", "p": {"domain_verify": "d3b005556643b373e87ddd5d6617469e"}, "fb": {"admins": 100004458014669}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NationalMemo", "section": "Politics", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2016-01-06T17:29:36-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-06T17:49:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "2016, gun control, mike huckabee, politics, news, democrats, republicans, elections, nation, presidential election"}, "article_summary": "And there is also the large and complicated federal tax code, which Huckabee wants to replace with a regressive national retail sales tax as the federal government\u2019s primary source of income.\n\u201cLet\u2019s show President Obama we believe in the Constitution and the 2nd Amendment \u2013 not gun control,\u201d Huckabee\u2019s fundraising page says.\nMike Huckabee is offering supporters a truly remarkable piece of campaign swag: In exchange for a donation, they can take their guns and shoot up a target marked with the word \u2018Obamacare\u2019!\n(Obama has supported Common Core, and created financial incentives to adopt it.\nAnd so the right wing has turned it into another bogeyman.)"}
