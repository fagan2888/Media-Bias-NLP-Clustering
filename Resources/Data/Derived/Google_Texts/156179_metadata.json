Hollywood Presbyterian said it paid $17,000 in bitcoin to hackers to regain access to the institution\u2019s computers.\n\nFred Ortega, a spokesman for Prime Healthcare, declined to comment on whether Prime received a ransom demand or paid any money, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\n\u201cThis is similar to challenges hospitals across the country are facing, and we have taken extraordinary steps to protect and expeditiously find a resolution to this disruption,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cThe concern now is to let law enforcement do their thing and find the culprit.\u201d\n\nFBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said Tuesday \u201cwe are investigating a compromise of the network at these locations.\u201d She declined to discuss specifics of the case. The FBI also has been investigating the attack at Hollywood Presbyterian.\n\nOrtega said the two Prime hospitals affected remain operational and steps are being taken to restore their computer systems to full functionality. He said some IT systems were shut down by hospital staff as a preventive measure so malicious software didn\u2019t spread further.\n\nThe company said it\u2019s working with data security experts and the California Department of Public Health on the matter.\n\nPrime Healthcare, based in Ontario, Calif., has acquired struggling hospitals across the country and has become one of the nation\u2019s largest health systems. It runs 42 hospitals in 14 states. The company is led by its outspoken chairman and chief executive, Dr. Prem Reddy.\n\nA series of high-profile data breaches in the past year have raised fresh questions about the ability of hospitals, health insurers and other medical providers to safeguard the vast troves of electronic medical records and other sensitive data they are stockpiling on millions of Americans.\n\nPrime Healthcare has faced trouble over lapses on patient privacy in the past.\n\nIn 2013, the company agreed to a $275,000 settlement to resolve a federal investigation involving a breach of patient confidentiality. Officials found that Prime\u2019s Shasta Regional Medical Center had shared a woman\u2019s medical files with journalists and sent an email about her treatment to all hospital employees.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The malware attack comes soon after a case where hackers demanded ransom from a Los Angeles hospital.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Hackers Demand Ransom from Two More Southern California Hospitals\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/03\\/22\\/hackers-attack-two-more-southern-california-hospitals\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-03-22 12:13:50\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-03-22 15:58:34\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":163275,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"News\",\"Privacy\"],\"categories\":[\"Digital Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/03\\/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-12.12.40-PM.png\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The malware attack comes soon after a case where hackers demanded ransom from a Los Angeles hospital.", "title": "Hackers Demand Ransom from Two More Southern California Hospitals", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/03/22/hackers-attack-two-more-southern-california-hospitals/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-22-at-12.12.40-PM.png", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "news,privacy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Hackers demanded a ransom from two more Southern California hospitals last week and federal authorities are investigating the case.\nFred Ortega, a spokesman for Prime Healthcare, declined to comment on whether Prime received a ransom demand or paid any money, citing the ongoing investigation.\nOrtega said the two Prime hospitals affected remain operational and steps are being taken to restore their computer systems to full functionality.\nPrime Healthcare, based in Ontario, Calif., has acquired struggling hospitals across the country and has become one of the nation\u2019s largest health systems.\nPrime Healthcare has faced trouble over lapses on patient privacy in the past."}
