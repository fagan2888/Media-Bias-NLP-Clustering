Q: Are liquid supplements a good idea to make sure elders get enough nutrition?

A: Watch the commercials and you’ll start to think that the secret to a long and healthy life can be found in a bottle of Boost, Ensure or another brand of liquid nutritional supplements.

The milkshake-like drinks, which are high in calories and contain vitamins, minerals and other nutrients, were developed for hospital patients at risk of becoming malnourished because they were unable to eat.

They’re now sold in supermarkets and advertised in TV commercials featuring silver-haired seniors walking the dog and kneeling down to hug their grandchildren.

But many experts question the need for these drinks. The American Geriatrics Society has advised against their use in the “medically ill or frail elderly.”

The recommendation noted that while these drinks may help elders gain weight, there’s no proof they improve quality of life, mood, functioning or even survival rates.

At the society’s annual meeting, Dr. Paul Mulhausen, chief medical officer for the health management firm Telligen, noted that the main ingredients are water, sugar, oils and flavoring. He described them as “liquid candy bars with vitamins.”

An 8-ounce serving of Ensure Original “milk chocolate” contains 9 grams of protein, 26 vitamins and minerals and 220 calories. But it also has no fiber and 15 grams of sugar. The same size bottle of Boost Original in “rich chocolate” has a similar nutrition profile but also contains 240 calories and 28 grams of sugar.

That’s almost twice as much as two frosted strawberry Pop-Tarts.
