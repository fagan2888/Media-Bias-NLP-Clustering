He was defeated for re-election in 1980 by Republican Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe Carter family has a history of pancreatic cancer, including his parents, two sisters and younger brother Billy Carter who all died from the disease.\n\nCarter told the New York Times in 2007 that he and other relatives had given blood for genetic studies seeking to help doctors diagnose the disease.\n\nAsked why he has escaped the disease for so long while it devastated the rest of his family he blamed smoking. \u201cThe only difference between me and my father and my siblings was that I never smoked a cigarette,\u201d said Carter, former governor of Georgia and a state senator. \u201cMy daddy smoked regularly. All of them smoked.\u201d\n\nCarter\u2019s health became a matter of concern in recent months after he cut short a trip to Guyana in May to observe national elections. At the time, the Carter Center in Atlanta said only that he had returned to his home state of Georgia after \u201cnot feeling well.\u201d\n\nThe Carter Center said last week that he had undergone elective surgery at Atlanta\u2019s Emory University Hospital to remove a small mass in his liver and his prognosis was excellent.\n\nDemocratic President Barack Obama, who is vacationing on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, spoke with Carter on Wednesday \u201cto wish him a full and speedy recovery,\u201d White House spokesman Eric Schultz said.\n\n\u201cJimmy, you\u2019re as resilient as they come, and along with the rest of America, we are rooting for you,\u201d Obama said in a statement issued by the White House.\n\nRepublican Georgia Governor Nathan Deal and his wife issued a statement saying Carter was \u201cin their prayers as he goes through treatment.\u201d\n\nCarter also received words of sympathy and encouragement via Twitter from former CNN host Larry King: \u201cWe go back many years. Stay strong Mr. President.\u201d\n\nA Nobel Peace Prize winner and activist on a range of issues from global democracy to women and children\u2019s rights, as well as affordable housing, Carter published his latest book last month, titled \u201cA Full Life: Reflections at Ninety.\u201d\n\nIn July, he gave a wide-ranging interview to Reuters Editor-at-Large Sir Harold Evans on his life from his childhood on a Georgia peanut farm to his presidency.\n\nCarter recalled growing up in a home without running water or electricity, at a time when he said the daily wage was $1 for a man and 75 cents for a woman, and a loaf of bread cost 5 cents.\n\nHe said the civil rights movement led to important progress toward racial equality in the United States, but lamented \u201cthere\u2019s still a great prejudice in police forces against black people and obviously some remnants of extreme racism.\u201d\n\nReporting by Letitia Stein in Tampa and David Adams in Miami; Additional reporting by David Beasley in Atlanta; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Mohammad Zargham", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Institutions, Politics, Baptist, Barack Obama, cancer, Christian, Jimmy Carter", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "(Reuters) The former president and Nobel Peace Prize winner said on Wednesday that recent liver surgery revealed he had cancer that had spread to other parts of his body.", "title": "Former President Jimmy Carter says he has cancer", "url": "https://religionnews.com/2015/08/13/former-u-s-president-carter-says-he-has-cancer/", "image": "https://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/thumbRNS-JIMMY-CARTER050714.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "https://religionnews.com/2015/08/13/former-u-s-president-carter-says-he-has-cancer/", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "https://religionnews.com/2015/08/13/former-u-s-president-carter-says-he-has-cancer/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "(Reuters) The former president and Nobel Peace Prize winner said on Wednesday that recent liver surgery revealed he had cancer that had spread to other parts of his body."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3582\"", "article_summary": "(Reuters) Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said on Wednesday that recent liver surgery revealed he had cancer that had spread to other parts of his body.\nThe Carter family has a history of pancreatic cancer, including his parents, two sisters and younger brother Billy Carter who all died from the disease.\n\u201cI will be rearranging my schedule as necessary so I can undergo treatment by physicians at Emory Healthcare,\u201d Carter, 90, said in a statement.\nDemocratic President Barack Obama, who is vacationing on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Massachusetts, spoke with Carter on Wednesday \u201cto wish him a full and speedy recovery,\u201d White House spokesman Eric Schultz said.\n\u201cThe only difference between me and my father and my siblings was that I never smoked a cigarette,\u201d said Carter, former governor of Georgia and a state senator."}
