Cedar Orthopedic Surgery Specialty Center, Cedar City, Utah, Nov. 12, 2015 | Photo by Tracie Sullivan, St. George News\n\nCEDAR CITY \u2013 Rep. Chris Stewart took a detour earlier this month during his visit to Southern Utah to meet with orthopedic surgeon Randy Delcore in Cedar City to listen to concerns the doctor has with Intermountain Healthcare and insurance provider SelectHealth.\n\nDelcore invited Stewart to stop by his medical center to discuss several issues and asked the Congressman for help in what he believes is an attempt by IHC to push him and others like him out of business.\n\nMedical providers, doctors for example, contract with insurance companies and in doing so agree to certain conditions imposed on them by those insurance companies. This enables the medical providers to accept a company\u2019s insurance for their patients but, by extension, requires them to impose the insurance company\u2019s conditions on their patients which can, in some cases, increase the ultimate costs to the patient.\n\nFor example, Delcore said, several insurance companies are requiring him to provide his services to patients at the hospital that he might otherwise be able to provide in his own surgical and imaging facilities, Cedar Orthopedic Speciality Center and Southern Utah MRI.\n\nDelcore said SelectHealth is refusing to contract with him to insure patients for MRIs performed in his own imaging facility and surgeries performed inside his outpatient surgical center.\n\nSelectHealth has several different insurance networks, three of them private and three underwriters for the government. These include Select Choice, Select Care and Select Med which are all private insurance and SelectHealth Advantage, SelectHealth Community Care and SelectHealth Share.\n\nDelcore and his imaging center are contracted with the private health care networks. However, none of the SelectHealth networks cover his surgical center but have limited their surgical coverage to patients treated at the hospital.\n\n\u201cAcross the board,\u201d Delcore said, \u201cwith all metrics, surgery centers have shown lower infection rates, much higher patient satisfaction scores probably because (of their) less clinical more personal environments and more hands-on.\u201d\n\nDelcore is not contracted at this time with any of the government networks but has been invited to join, said Jon Pike, regional operations director for Southwest SelectHealth.\n\n\u201cWe have invited him to join and are in the process of negotiating those terms,\u201d Pike said, \u201cbecause Dr. Delcore has said he would join if we contract with his MRI facility; so we are now discussing that.\u201d\n\nDelcore said the contracts he does have with SelectHealth, one of the largest insurance providers in Southern Utah, will be tightening after the first of the year.\n\n\u201cUp until now if you weren\u2019t a provider for SelectHealth they still have out-of-contract benefits but starting Jan. 1 (2016) there\u2019s no out-of-contract benefits,\u201d Delcore said. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken the year to gather the flock in and now they\u2019re locking the gate and you have no other options. So it takes away the choice.\u201d\n\nWhat this means for the patient, he said, is more expensive health care because all surgical care is restricted to a hospital setting.\n\nPike agreed an outpatient surgical center such as Delcore\u2019s may offer some out-of-pocket savings to the patient because of the hospital\u2019s overhead and administrative costs but said the savings for the insurance companies comes in volume which savings are then transferred to the patient.\n\n\u201cThey (insurance companies) are looking at what kind of volume are you going to deliver to me,\u201d he said.\n\nDaron Pealock, registered nurse with a Bachelor of Nursing and administrator for Cedar Orthopedic Surgery Specialty Center, said he tried to get the insurance provider to contract with Delcore for months. Finally, he said, he was told by a SelectHealth representative the company\u2019s contract with IHC prohibited it from signing a contract with the doctor.\n\nUnder the law, any contract between providers and insurance companies are confidential so the SelectHealth representative could not give him the details of the contract with IHC, Pealock said.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t give me a reason why because they can\u2019t,\u201d Pealock said. \u201cThe law says insurance contracts are considered proprietary so what that means is, it\u2019s confidential and they can\u2019t talk about the details of their terms. All they\u2019ll tell me is that their contract with IHC prevents them from contracting with us.\u201d\n\nDelcore said he has also asked for a letter from SelectHealth representatives stating the reason the insurance company won\u2019t contract with him and each time he has been denied.\n\n\u201cEvery time they tell me, \u2018you know we can\u2019t do that,\u2019\u201d Delcore said. \u201cI just want something I can move forward with but they won\u2019t. They\u2019re brilliant. They\u2019re brilliant strategists to just say no and don\u2019t cause too much of a ruff or we\u2019ll do what we\u2019re doing to you now.\u201d\n\nThe issues have also rippled out to other insurance companies, Pealock said, including Educators Mutual Insurance and Coventry, that have both recently denied Delcore a contract citing their ongoing contract with IHC as the reason.\n\nUnited Health Insurance is another company refusing to contract with Delcore but has not stated a reason for its refusal, he said.\n\nPike, who stressed he only represents SelectHealth, said IHC will often offer savings to insurance companies in return for an exclusive contract. However, he added, no one forces the insurance companies to restrict health care coverage to one provider.\n\n\u201cWhat I do know is, no one makes these insurance companies like EMI, Coventry, and United sign a contract with only IHC,\u201d he said. \u201cThey choose that because they believe it offers them the best discount and savings that ultimately transfers to savings for the consumer.\u201d\n\nThese types of negotiations aren\u2019t unique to IHC, Pike added, but are done all the time in an effort to bring savings to the insurance company and to the consumer.\n\nDelcore called the whole thing \u201cun-American,\u201d and said the way it is going it is creating a monopoly in the health care industry.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Economics 101. If only one person is providing a service and only one entity is providing a service, the prices are fixed. You have no way of finding anything cheaper,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s anti-competitive. It\u2019s antitrust.\u201d\n\nIn his conversation with the congressman, Delcore blamed the Affordable Care Act for some of the problems, but he also believes, he said, it\u2019s an issue with the current \u201cany willing provider\u201d law in Utah that says insurance companies should contract with any provider willing to do so.\n\nWhile the law was written in an effort to protect doctors by allowing them the opportunity to contract with major insurance providers it falls short in doing so, Delcore told Stewart.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s empower our \u2018any willing provider\u2019 law. The law has been on the books since I can remember. We enjoy that law that\u2019s there but it never gets exercised or empowered and nobody will fight it because they\u2019re fighting a giant,\u201d Delcore said referring to IHC. \u201cIt has no legs. No one will stand behind it.\u201d\n\nPealock said the law has no teeth because it fails to demand that insurance companies contract with providers who are willing to do so.\n\n\u201cThe law says insurance companies \u2018should\u2019 contract with any willing provider but that\u2019s it. It doesn\u2019t say they have to or that there\u2019s a penalty for not contracting with them it just says they should,\u201d he said.\n\nPike also said the law only covers rural areas and does not include Washington and Iron counties.\n\nSince the law stems from state jurisdiction, Stewart said, he encourages Delcore and his staff to contact their state legislators to work on making changes to the law.\n\n\u201cGo to the state because that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to find your relief. Happy to talk to you any time and there are federal issues that we can talk about, that we should talk about,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cOn this one particular thing your immediate relief is going to come from the state.\u201d\n\nStewart told Delcore there is nothing he could do on the federal level with the current administration in power but asked him to contact his staff anyway to let them know what problems he is facing since the passing of the ACA.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kinda kicking our heads against the bricks under this administration (Obama) if we think we\u2019re going to make any changes,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cBut get with my legislative director, Gordon Larsen, to see what together you guys can come up with as far as if you think there\u2019s something we can do back in D.C.\u201d\n\nEmail: tsullivan@stgnews.com\n\nTwitter: @STGnews\n\nCopyright St. George News, SaintGeorgeUtah.com LLC, 2015, all rights reserved.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/wp-content/themes/st_george_utah_2015/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "Dr. Randy Delcore went over his concerns with IHC and SelectHealth last week with Congressman Chris Stewart during his visit to southern Utah.", "application-name": "stgnews", "og": {"site_name": "St George News", "description": "Dr. Randy Delcore went over his concerns with IHC and SelectHealth last week with Congressman Chris Stewart during his visit to southern Utah.", "title": "Delcore spends time with Congressman Stewart to express concerns with IHC and SelectHealth", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-23-at-9.29.50-AM.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-23T09:38:22+00:00", "url": "https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2015/11/23/tds-dr-delcore-says-selecthealth-conditions-stifle-competition/", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "stgnews", "robots": "noodp", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/wp-content/themes/st_george_utah_2015/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "Local", "tag": "utah", "published_time": "2015-11-23T09:35:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-23T09:38:22+00:00", "author": "www.facebook.com/traciesullivan"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "SelectHealth, Congressman Chris Stewart, Affordable Care Act, IHC, Cedar City News,"}, "article_summary": "These include Select Choice, Select Care and Select Med which are all private insurance and SelectHealth Advantage, SelectHealth Community Care and SelectHealth Share.\nMedical providers, doctors for example, contract with insurance companies and in doing so agree to certain conditions imposed on them by those insurance companies.\nForeground: Dr. Randy Delcore and Congressman Chris Stewart take a moment to pose for the camera after spending some time talking about issues Delcore is having with IHC and SelectHealth Insurance.\n\u201cThey (insurance companies) are looking at what kind of volume are you going to deliver to me,\u201d he said.\nPike, who stressed he only represents SelectHealth, said IHC will often offer savings to insurance companies in return for an exclusive contract."}
