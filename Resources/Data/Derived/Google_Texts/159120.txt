Denver, state and national police groups are endorsing a pro-law enforcement rally Saturday at a memorial to fallen officers.

During a Feb. 14 protest against police use of force, demonstrators threw red paint, since cleaned off, on the memorial at Denver police headquarters. Two men were later charged with vandalism.

Some officers have criticized Chief Robert White for not allowing them to try to stop the vandalism during the protest, while others have supported White and a policy of avoiding confrontation to keep officers safe.

Supporters of police have been leaving flowers, candles and flags at the memorial since last week's protest.

Saturday's rally has been endorsed by the Denver Police Protective Association and similar groups from Aurora, Boulder and Colorado Springs as well as state and national groups.
