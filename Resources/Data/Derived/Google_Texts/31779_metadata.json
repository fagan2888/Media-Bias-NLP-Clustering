H3N2 viruses are commonly known as swine flu viruses, and early data suggests the current flu season \u201ccould be severe,\u201d according to public health officials.\n\nThis year\u2019s vaccine, which is available as a shot or nasal spray, is about 23 percent effective, while the best vaccines from past seasons have ranged between 50 and 60 percent effective. For the already hesitant, this lower rate than usual means a flu vaccine is simply not worth it.\n\nAnti-(Flu)Vackers\n\nThe latest statistics from the CDC show flu vaccination coverage during the 2012-13 flu season to be about 45 percent, an incremental but solid gain of three percentage points on the previous season. In light of the CDC\u2019s recommendation that everyone over the age of 6 months get vaccinated, these figures are less than inspiring to public health officials.\n\nCommon reasons why many of us decide against getting vaccinated include the fact that we're not in a high-risk group or we simply think it\u2019s unnecessary \u2014 how bad could the flu be if you\u2019re basically healthy? Approximately 36,000 people die from flu each year in the U.S., with 95 percent of these deaths occurring in people over 65. Another reason many people avoid a flu shot is the belief it could make us sick. The vaccine does not contain a live virus, so you won\u2019t ever get the flu from a shot or nasal spray. Admittedly, though, it is possible for you to develop a fever and muscle aches lasting a day or two.\n\nTo explain the less than stellar performance of its current vaccine, the CDC says the flu viruses chosen for the production of a vaccine and the flu viruses actually in circulation must be similar. Unfortunately, along with some viruses appearing only after the current vaccine went into production, about 70 percent of the predominant viruses used to create the vaccine have \u201cdrifted\u201d from their original genetic composition. This likely accounts for the reduced effectiveness.\n\nGenerally, the flu shot works best in young, healthy people. The earliest estimates for the current vaccine show effectiveness to be highest among children under 17 and lower for older age groups.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cdc flu vaccine, swine flu, h3n2", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "While early data suggests the current flu season \u201ccould be severe,\u201d this year\u2019s vaccine is about 23 percent effective.", "title": "This Year's Flu Vaccine Is Only 23% Effective", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/cdc-flu-vaccine-only-23-effective-experts-say-shot-can-still-prevent-death-318150", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/16/flu-vaccine.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While early data suggests the current flu season \u201ccould be severe,\u201d this year\u2019s vaccine is about 23 percent effective.", "title": "This Year's Flu Vaccine Is Only 23% Effective", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/cdc-flu-vaccine-only-23-effective-experts-say-shot-can-still-prevent-death-318150", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/16/flu-vaccine.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/16/flu-vaccine.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-01-16T12:11:15-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-16T12:11:14-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "While early data suggests the current flu season \u201ccould be severe,\u201d this year\u2019s vaccine is about 23 percent effective."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcba85\"", "article_summary": "H3N2 viruses are commonly known as swine flu viruses, and early data suggests the current flu season \u201ccould be severe,\u201d according to public health officials.\nTo explain the less than stellar performance of its current vaccine, the CDC says the flu viruses chosen for the production of a vaccine and the flu viruses actually in circulation must be similar.\nThe earliest estimates for the current vaccine show effectiveness to be highest among children under 17 and lower for older age groups.\nAnother reason many people avoid a flu shot is the belief it could make us sick.\nFor the already hesitant, this lower rate than usual means a flu vaccine is simply not worth it."}
