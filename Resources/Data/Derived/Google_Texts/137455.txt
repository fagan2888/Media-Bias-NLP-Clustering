Plans for a new Orlando City Soccer stadium could be stalling, because $30 million for the project has not been approved by lawmakers.

The current legislative session ends one week from Friday.

Many Orlando City Soccer fans received an email from the team, asking them to contact local representatives and voice their support for the Major League Soccer stadium funding bill.

Mayor Buddy Dyer said that money is integral to the new stadium, and with the funds still in limbo in Tallahassee, it's unclear what will happen if it doesn't get approved.

Dyer said the city does not have an alternative plan.

"We'll have to sit down with the team and go from there. But, we're hopeful we will get it approved," Dyer said.

The state funds were up for grabs between Orlando City Soccer, the Daytona International Speedway and two other Florida sports teams.

“They set up a process last year that we adhered to, and we anticipated it would be pretty much a perfunctory vote, but there’s a lot of politics going on in Tallahassee right now. So we’re waiting and watching,” Dyer said.

The $30 million was intended to add to the $85 million plans for Orlando City's new home, helping to build a $115 million facility that's expected to be finished by early next season.

But just like how anything can happen on the field, the same goes with the House and Senate floor.

The hold-up comes down to a showdown over healthcare.

“The funding was already allocated last year, and it's apples and oranges. One thing has nothing to do with the other,” Dyer said.

While that may be so, some in the legislature said it’s hard to justify paying for stadiums while leaving healthcare unfunded.

Lawmakers are at a stalemate over whether or not to expand Medicaid funding, a provision the Affordable Care Act.

The bill needs to pass by May 1.
