Further, they expect that the wealthiest colleges and universities will be most successful in the ratings system Obama has proposed.\n\nThose are the findings of a poll by Gallup and Inside Higher Ed of American college and university presidents, which attracted responses from 675 of them. Gallup has a 95 percent confidence level that the margin of error is plus/minus 3.8 percentage points. The presidents were given complete anonymity so they could answer without regard to the politics of opposing a plan that has become a top priority for the Obama administration.\n\nThe plan -- proposed in August -- would, among other things, create a new rating system for colleges in which they would be evaluated based on various outcomes (such as graduation rates and graduate earnings), on affordability and on access (measures such as the proportion of students receiving Pell Grants). Then the plan would link student aid to these ratings, such that students who enroll at high-performing colleges would receive larger Pell Grants and more favorable rates on student loans. (Some parts of the plan, such as the changes in the Pell program, would require Congressional approval.)\n\nObama administration officials have said that the colleges would be compared to institutions with similar missions. But details on how the system would work have yet to be fully developed or released.\n\nThe skepticism of the plan among presidents is striking given how many of them say that they appreciate the way Obama has repeatedly stressed the importance of higher education. Indeed, in a 2012 survey of presidents, Inside Higher Ed found that nearly two-thirds of them planned to vote for the president's re-election -- and that percentage would have been even higher except for strong opposition from presidents of for-profit institutions.\n\nThe lack of enthusiasm for the president's plan is evident in a series of questions. Only 2 percent of presidents said that the plan will be \"very effective\" at making higher education affordable, only 19 percent think it will have a positive impact on their institution, and majorities question the use of some of the criteria in the plan.\n\nThe presidents generally answered on a four- or five-point scale, and also had a \"don't know\" option, which is why these figures don't always add to 100 percent. Here are some of the answers to general questions:\n\nHow effective will President Obama's plan to make college more affordable be?\n\nDo you agree or disagree that students will use the new information provided by the Department of Education to make informed decisions in selecting higher education institutions?\n\nStrongly agree: 2 percent\n\nAgree: 11 percent\n\nIn the middle: 27 percent\n\nDisagree: 34 percent\n\nStrongly disagree: 22 percent\n\nDo you agree or disagree that the president's strategy to link federal financial aid to an institution's performance on the new rating system is a good idea?\n\nStrongly agree: 3 percent\n\nAgree: 13 percent\n\nIn the middle: 30 percent\n\nDisagree: 30 percent\n\nStrongly disagree: 35 percent\n\nIn your opinion, will President Obama's plan to make college more affordable have a positive effect on your institution?\n\nDon't know: 31 percent\n\nYes: 19 percent\n\nNo: 50 percent\n\nThe presidents were also asked about the appropriateness of any rating system including certain factors.\n\nFactor 5 (strongly agree) 4 3 2 1 (strongly disagree) Percentage of students receiving Pell Grants 9% 17% 22% 23% 27% Institution's average tuition cost 9% 19% 23% 25% 24% Total scholarships institution awards to students 3% 18% 28% 26% 23% Average student debt 8% 23% 26% 24% 19% Graduation rates 18% 37% 23% 14% 8% Advanced degrees earned by graduates 6% 17% 23% 21% 21% Post-graduation earnings of graduates 6% 19% 25% 23% 24%\n\nWith the exception of graduation rates, college presidents are more skeptical than supportive of all of these potential parts of a formula for rating colleges. And measures that are frequently cited by politicians (such as the percentage of Pell Grant students enrolled) did not attract much support as criteria for a rating system.\n\nOne of the most hotly debated potential measures is the post-graduation earnings average of graduates. Liberal arts college presidents have been particularly vocal in questioning the measure, arguing that while they educate their students for leadership positions in society, they focus on learning for a lifetime, not for the first job after college. At the same time, many publications regularly rank colleges by graduates' income, and plenty of colleges boast about those results.\n\nThe new poll suggests that college presidents believe in taking the long view in measuring post-graduation income.\n\nCollege Presidents on Appropriate Time Frame for Measuring Post-Graduation Earnings\n\nAppropriate Time Frame Percentage 1-3 years 11% 4-6 years 35% 7-9 years 16% 10-12 years 19% 13-15 years 2% More than 15 years 9% Don't know 10%\n\nOne of the criticisms of the Obama plan from the start is that it would favor the wealthiest institutions, which tend to attract the best-prepared students (and so have high graduation rates), enroll students who are well-connected (which, combined with their good preparation, lands them good jobs) and have the endowments to support generous financial aid packages. Fifty-two percent of presidents agree or strongly agree that wealthier institutions will fare best under the Obama ratings.\n\nMolly Corbett Broad, president of the American Council on Education, said that the results were consistent with what she is hearing from college presidents, which is a lot of concern \"about unintended consequences that may come from a well-intentioned set of metrics.\" She stressed that most college presidents are \"fully aligned with President Obama's ultimate goals -- expanding access and making college more affordable.\"\n\nBut she said that there are doubts among many presidents both about the idea that these data will help students, and that ratings can be done correctly. She noted that most colleges already share considerable data -- often covering information similar to what President Obama says should go into ratings. \"But there's not much evidence that the array of key data metrics that most institutions routinely post have made a huge difference,\" she said.\n\nAt the same time, she said she worries about the impact of ratings. If one looks at existing rankings systems, most college leaders \"are skeptical but we pay a lot of attention to them.\" Broad said that she feared a new ratings system might have create the wrong incentives. \"There's a real concern that some of the measures might cause institutions to alter their admissions and aid awarding in ways that don't advance access to low-income college students,\" Broad said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2013/12/16/most-presidents-doubt-obamas-plan-promote-affordable-higher-education", "image": "https://www.insidehighered.com/sites/all/themes/ihecustom/images/facebook_icon_large.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Gallup/Inside Higher Ed poll of college presidents find that most doubt many aspects of the president's plan to make college more affordable.", "title": "Most presidents doubt Obama's plan to promote affordable higher education"}, "msapplication-config": "/IEconfig.xml", "description": "Gallup/Inside Higher Ed poll of college presidents find that most doubt many aspects of the president's plan to make college more affordable.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "follow, index"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9ae8\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON -- Most college presidents doubt that President Obama's plan to promote affordable higher education will be effective, or that it will lead students to make better informed choices.\nShe stressed that most college presidents are \"fully aligned with President Obama's ultimate goals -- expanding access and making college more affordable.\"\nThe lack of enthusiasm for the president's plan is evident in a series of questions.\nThe new poll suggests that college presidents believe in taking the long view in measuring post-graduation income.\nFifty-two percent of presidents agree or strongly agree that wealthier institutions will fare best under the Obama ratings."}
