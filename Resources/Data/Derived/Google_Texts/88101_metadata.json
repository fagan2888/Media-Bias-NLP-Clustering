The new Mercy hospital was built to withstand the most powerful storms, featuring a 450-foot underground tunnel linked to a 30,000-square-foot central utility plant housing mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems and windows that can withstand 250-mile-per-hour winds.\n\nThe generator system can also power the hospital for 96 hours on its own.\n\nFollow Healthcare Finance on Twitter and LinkedIn.\n\n\u201cThis replacement hospital is opening just 46 months after the tornado hit Joplin, which is approximately half the time you would normally anticipate to plan, design and construct a similarly sized hospital,\u201d said Ryan Felton, McCarthy project director, the the statement.\n\n\u201cThis project was meaningful on many levels. It wasn\u2019t only about a facility, it was about people \u2013 a community suffering from loss and devastation,\u201d said said Norman Morgan, HKS principal-in-charge. \u201cOur job was to give them hope \u2013 give them back their hospital. This rebuilding effort became part of the healing process for the community.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @HenryPowderly", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/mercy-joplin-sets-march-22-open-date-new-storm-proof-hospital", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Mercy-hospital-workers-Joplin-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The 890,000-square-foot facility replaces the St. John's Mercy Regional Medical Center, which was devastated by the 2011 tornado.", "title": "Mercy Joplin sets March 22 open date for new storm-proof hospital"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Mercy-hospital-workers-Joplin-feature.gif"}, "title": "Mercy Joplin sets March 22 open date for new storm-proof hospital", "description": "The 890,000-square-foot facility replaces the St. John's Mercy Regional Medical Center, which was devastated by the 2011 tornado.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "More than 3 years after a tornado destroyed much of Joplin, Missouri, officials have set an opening date for a new hospital to replace the one destroyed by the storm.&#13; The Mercy Hospital Joplin will open on March 22, the healthcare provider said on Friday, ending a $465 million project to build the new facility.
