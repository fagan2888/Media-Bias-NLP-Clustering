The study, published online in Neurology, found that 66 patients with depression, or 1.42 percent, developed Parkinson\u2019s disease, compared with 97, or 0.52 percent, among those who were not depressed. Researchers found clinical depression was associated with more than three times the risk for Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cOur paper does not convey the message that all depression leads to Parkinson\u2019s disease,\u201d said the senior author, Dr. Albert C. Yang, a professor of psychiatry at the National Yang-Ming University in Taiwan. \u201cBut particularly the depressed elderly and those with difficult-to-treat depression should be alert to the possibility of neurological disease and Parkinson\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Nicholas Bakalar, The New York Times\n\nTESTICULAR CANCER MAY BE PRICE PAID FOR SUN PROTECTION\n\nA genetic variant that increases the risk of testicular cancer may be favored by evolution because it helps protect those with fair skin from the sun\u2019s damaging ultraviolet rays, according to a new study.\n\nThe finding could account for white men being more susceptible than black men to this type of cancer.\n\nGareth Bond, a molecular biologist at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in Oxford, U.K., and colleagues hit upon the unexpected tradeoff while studying inherited genes that influence cancer risk. They were interested in a gene known as p53, which is mutated in more than half of all cancers.\n\nIn the new study, Bond and colleagues were looking in p53\u2019s target genes for mutations that had managed to hang on. Finally, the search, reported in Cell, narrowed down to one cancer-causing mutation.\n\nOne way a seemingly deleterious mutation can become common over time is if it also has a benefit that outweighs its harm. The benefit, the researchers suggest, is that under normal circumstances, KITLG protects pale skin against damage from sunlight.\n\nBond adds, \u201cFor our ancestors, protection from sun damage was critical to survival. For example, a bad burn can breach the skin\u2019s protective barrier against infection, and our forebears had no antibiotics.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Elizabeth Norton, ScienceNOW\n\nSTATINS MAY HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON GUM HEALTH\n\nStatins may have a beneficial side effect: reducing gum inflammation, or periodontitis.\n\nAlmost half of adults in the United States have periodontitis, and it is a known risk factor for atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in the arteries.\n\nIn a randomized trial, researchers assigned 83 people with heart disease or at high risk for heart disease to take a daily dose of either 80 milligrams or 10 milligrams of atorvastatin (both Lipitor and generics) for 12 weeks. Doctors used CT and PET scans to evaluate them for periodontal disease and arterial inflammation at the start of the study and again at the end.\n\nThere was a significant reduction in gum inflammation in the group that took the 80-milligram dose compared with those who took the lower dose.\n\nThe differences were greatest in those with the most severe gum disease at the start of the study and the changes correlated with changes in artery inflammation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprising, a newly recognized effect,\u201d said the senior author, Dr. Ahmed Tawakol, co-director of a cardiac program at Harvard.\n\nStill, he does not recommend treating gum disease with statins.\n\nThe study, paid for by the drugmaker Merck, was published online in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology.\n\n\u2014 Nicholas Bakalar, The New York Times", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "Research suggests depression may be sign of looming Parkinson's; study ties testicular cancer to gene mutation"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde430\"", "article_summary": "DEPRESSION A POSSIBLE FORERUNNER OF PARKINSON\u2019SDepression may be an independent risk factor for Parkinson\u2019s disease, a new study has found.\nResearchers found clinical depression was associated with more than three times the risk for Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nGareth Bond, a molecular biologist at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in Oxford, U.K., and colleagues hit upon the unexpected tradeoff while studying inherited genes that influence cancer risk.\nThere was a significant reduction in gum inflammation in the group that took the 80-milligram dose compared with those who took the lower dose.\nStill, he does not recommend treating gum disease with statins."}
