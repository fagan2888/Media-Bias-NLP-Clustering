CMS announced a major program implementation delay on a semiprivate website.

The federal government is putting off the day when it checks to see which health insurers got too much money, and which got too little money, from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) cost-sharing reduction (CSR) program.

The program helps PPACA exchange plan users with incomes under 250 percent of the federal poverty level — the core of the exchange plan market — pay deductibles, co-payments and coinsurance amounts.
