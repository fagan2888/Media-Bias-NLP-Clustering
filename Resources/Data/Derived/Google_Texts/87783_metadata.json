So the Health Care Authority, the agency that runs Medicaid, partnered with the Washington State Hospital Association, the Washington State Medical Association and others to adopt seven best practices aimed at ensuring ERs are used for their intended purpose.\n\nThey include things like keeping tabs on frequent ER users, referring people to primary care doctors and tightening up policies around prescribing narcotics.\n\nThe HCA\u2019s chief medical officer Daniel Lessler says one crucial practice is sharing patient information among ERs, which can reduce costly duplications.\n\n\u201cA patient who is seen in an emergency room for a headache and got a head CT comes in with the same complaint to another emergency room three days later. Without that information, they probably are going to repeat the work-up,\u201d Lessler said.\n\nIn fiscal year 2013, ER visits dropped by 10 percent. Visits by those frequent users dropped even more, as did the rate of visits resulting in a scheduled drug prescription.\n\nThe ER reforms probably aren\u2019t the only reason for those changes and the cost savings. Lessler says other changes over the same period, like moving people to managed care, probably get some credit.\n\nA large study in Oregon recently found that expanding Medicaid to more people increased ER use, rather than decreasing it as hoped. That finding is controversial, but Lessler notes that Washington\u2019s ER reforms put it in a good position as the state adds hundreds of thousands to the Medicaid rolls as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe HCA and its partners plan to detail the findings at a noon announcement Thursday.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Other News", "description": "Washington\u2019s Medicaid program saved more than $33 million last year, and a new report gives much of the credit to a big push to reduce emergency room", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://www.kplu.org/post/new-emergency-room-guidelines-help-washington-save-millions-cut-er-visits", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kplu/files/styles/medium/public/201403/UMHealthSystem.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Washington\u2019s Medicaid program saved more than $33 million last year, and a new report gives much of the credit to a big push to reduce emergency room", "title": "New Emergency Room Guidelines Help Washington Save Millions, Cut ER Visits"}, "story_id": 291848494, "twitter": {"site": "@KPLU", "card": "summary", "creator": "@gabrielspitzer"}, "author": "Gabriel Spitzer", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "New Emergency Room Guidelines Help Washington Save Millions, Cut ER Visits"}, "nid": 15059, "datePublished": "2014-03-20", "keywords": "Emergency Department, Medicaid", "wordCount": 402, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdef49\"", "article_summary": "\u201cA patient who is seen in an emergency room for a headache and got a head CT comes in with the same complaint to another emergency room three days later.\nERs are a great place to treat real emergencies, but a very expensive place to do run-of-the-mill medical care.\nWashington\u2019s Medicaid program saved more than $33 million last year, and a new report gives much of the credit to a big push to reduce emergency room visits.\nIn fiscal year 2013, ER visits dropped by 10 percent.\nLessler says other changes over the same period, like moving people to managed care, probably get some credit."}
