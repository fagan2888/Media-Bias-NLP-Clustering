After his most recent arrest, George Zimmerman drew the ire Saturday Night Live this week.

In its cold open, Piers Morgan, played by Taran Killam, introduces himself as the “tiny little fool of news,” and interviews Zimmerman’s new girlfriend, Samantha Scheibe, played by Kate McKinnon. Scheibe didn’t hold back her obscure adoration for Zimmerman, who was charged with felony aggravated assault for allegedly pointing a shotgun at her earlier this week.

“I know some people think he’s a criminal and guess what, so do I because he stole my heart,” Scheibe told Morgan.

Scheibe proceeded to dish all the dirty details of her relationship Zimmerman, from her preference for a man who’s “features look like they’re being vacuumed right to the center of his face” to recounting his affinity to roll playing in the bedroom.

“We do this one where I pretend I’m a sexy French maid who’s wandered onto his property, and he’s a man who has every right to defend himself,” Scheibe said, touching on Zimmerman’s acquittal earlier this year in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin.

Scheibe’s relationship with Zimmerman wasn’t the only life choice Morgan questioned during the segment. He also interviewed Florida police chief Mike Davis, played by Bobby Moynihan, who explained why Zimmerman still is not in jail.

“Well, Piers, it’s simple,” Davis said. “He has way more guns than us.”

Davis said that the police had in fact put a tracker on Zimmerman, while describing a play-by-play of his moves from a gun store to a liquor store, and back to the gun store.

Also making an appearance on Morgan’s show Saturday night was George Zimmer, founder of men’s clothing retailer Men’s Wearhouse.

“I do not like the way he’s making me look, I guarantee it,” Zimmer, played by Mike O’Brien said. “He’s dragging the first two-thirds of my name through the mud. I keep telling people I’m not George Zimmerman, I’m George Zimmer, man.”
