As the largest players in health insurance seek to become even larger through mergers, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, one of Connecticut's newest, regional entrants, has reached the milestone of 10,000 members in the state.

Harvard Pilgrim sold its first coverage in Connecticut in July, 2014, to Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven. The Boston-based insurer had hoped to hit 13,000 by the end of this year, said Jason Madrak, the vice president in charge of Connecticut operations, in Hartford.

"We should surpass 13,000 by a pretty good clip," Madrak said.

Harvard Pilgrim has 1.3 million medical member-customers in four states, more than 1 million of them in Massachusetts, where the company has forged a very strong reputation for customer service. It was rated as the nation's No. 1 health plan for 10 straight years by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, and was No. 2 this year.

In Connecticut, the insurer has sold plans through about 200 employers but has yet to enter the individual market. That will change in 2016, when Harvard Pilgrim plans to file and sell coverage for 2017 through the Obamacare exchange, known as Access Health CT.

Obamacare envisioned an insurance market in which regional players such as the nonprofit Harvard Pilgrim and ConnectiCare, which is owned by New York-based EmblemHealth, thrived alongside larger national insurers.

Madrak, a former Access Health CT marketing chief who joined Harvard Pilgrim this year, would not say how many members the company needs to break even in Connecticut, but he said, "we should hit that fairly soon."

Harvard Pilgrim has 19 employees in downtown Hartford and contracts with 28 of the state's 29 acute care hospitals â€” with St. Mary's in Waterbury the lone exception, Madrak said.
