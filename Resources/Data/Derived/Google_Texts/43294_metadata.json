The recent Hobby Lobby case unleashed a fresh wave of moral indignation from supporters and protestors alike. What's more, the clear gender divide in the Supreme Court justices' ruling seems only to have strengthened pop-culture claims that female contraception is controversial precisely because it is attached to women's health.

Staying within the category of contraception products, an IUD1\n\nis equal to approximately 900-1,800 condoms. That is 2-4 years of sex daily.\n\nBirth control is a prescribed item, a surgical procedure. Its status as such ought to warrant the security of insurance coverage. Its price-points certainly make it necessary.\n\n1. One of the forms of birth control taken off The Affordable Care Act's required provisions by the Hobby Lobby ruling.\n\n2.
