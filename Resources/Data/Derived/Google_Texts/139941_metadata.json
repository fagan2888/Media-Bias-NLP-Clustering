It has ordered stores to sell them in child-resistant packages and bars labels designed to appeal to children. It requires manufacturers to list ingredients, serving sizes and expiration dates.\n\nBut critics say the regulations are not strict enough, especially for products that can contain 10 times as much psychoactive THC as the marijuana a casual user might take. (Because prices often depend on the amount of THC, one highly potent caramel chew can sell for $20 while a package of 10 less-concentrated candies might be the same price.) And like flavored cigarettes or wine coolers, critics say, edible marijuana offers a dangerously easy on-ramp for younger users.\n\n\"They're attractive to kids; they're easily disguised,\" said Gina Carbone of Smart Colorado, a group that opposes legalization. \"They're not being regulated properly at all to protect kids.\"\n\nOne survey has found a small but growing number of children seeking treatment after accidentally consuming marijuana. Fourteen such children visited the emergency department of Children's Hospital Colorado in the Denver area from October 2009 through December 2011, researchers reported in 2013 in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. Before 2009, researchers reported no marijuana exposures.\n\nThe research took place after an explosion of medical-marijuana shops in Colorado, but before voters passed measures to legalize the sale of recreational marijuana. Dr. George Sam Wang, an author of the study and a clinical instructor in pediatrics at Children's Hospital, said he had not seen any additional increases in children's exposure since recreational sales began this year\n\nThe children, many of them toddlers, were taken in because they seemed strangely sleepy and disoriented. One had trouble breathing. About half had eaten marijuana cookies, cakes or candies.\n\nMarijuana, even if consumed by children in high doses, poses few of the grave dangers of overdosing on alcohol or drinking household chemicals.\n\nBut doctors said young children who consume marijuana are at risk of falling and hurting themselves or falling asleep in a position where they could not breathe.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/02/hfyouth25.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Colorado, like the other states with medical or recreational marijuana, has tried to keep the products away from children.\nThe research took place after an explosion of medical-marijuana shops in Colorado, but before voters passed measures to legalize the sale of recreational marijuana.\nBut doctors said young children who consume marijuana are at risk of falling and hurting themselves or falling asleep in a position where they could not breathe.\nBy JACK HEALY, The New York TimesAll day long, customers at LoDo Wellness Center, one of Colorado's new recreational marijuana stores, reach into the refrigerator and pull out tasty ways to get high.\nAnd like flavored cigarettes or wine coolers, critics say, edible marijuana offers a dangerously easy on-ramp for younger users."}
