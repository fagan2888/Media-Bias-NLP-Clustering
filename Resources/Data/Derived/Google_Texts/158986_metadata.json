High Commissioner for Refugees, is on a four-day visit to the Southeast Asian nation.\n\nDuring her meeting with the factory workers on the outskirts of an industrial zone in Myanmar\u2019s largest city, Yangon, Jolie and Suu Kyi witnessed first-hand the conditions the women live in, mostly low-cost hostels. Jolie also toured inside the factory.\n\nShe traveled to Kachin state earlier this week, home to more than 10,000 displaced people since a cease-fire between Myanmar\u2019s government and ethnic rebels has broken down in 2011.\n\nAccording to her trip details, it is unlikely that Jolie will be able to travel to western Rakhine State, where more than 100,000 Muslim minority Rohingya live in apartheid-like conditons in camps.\n\nIt is Jolie\u2019s first visit to Myanmar, which only recently emerged from decades of military rule. More than a dozen ethnic minority groups, mostly in Myanmar\u2019s border areas, have been fighting for greater autonomy since the country attained independence from Britain 67 years ago.\n\nRecently, the world attention has turned to the plight of stateless Rohingya Muslims who have been trafficked from Myanmar and Bangladesh aboard overcrowded boats. Dozens of graves as well as pens likely used as cages for Rohingya have been found in abandoned jungle camps on both sides of the Thailand-Malaysian border.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Angelina Jolie has joined Myanmar's opposition leader and democracy icon, Aung San Suu Kyi, in sitting down with female workers to learn more about their dire conditions.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Angelina Jolie has joined Myanmar\u2019s opposition leader and democracy icon, Aung San Suu Kyi, in sitting down with female workers to learn more about their dire conditions.", "title": "Jolie, Suu Kyi visit Myanmar female factory workers", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/1/jolie-suu-kyi-visit-myanmar-female-factory-workers/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/01/7f45311e2228ca227d0f6a706700bf68.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/01/7f45311e2228ca227d0f6a706700bf68.jpg", "description": "Angelina Jolie has joined Myanmar's opposition leader and democracy icon, Aung San Suu Kyi, in sitting down with female workers to learn more about their dire conditions.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jolie, Suu Kyi visit Myanmar female factory workers"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "YANGON, Myanmar (AP) - Angelina Jolie has joined Myanmar\u2019s opposition leader and democracy icon, Aung San Suu Kyi, in sitting down with female workers to learn more about their dire conditions.\nDuring her meeting with the factory workers on the outskirts of an industrial zone in Myanmar\u2019s largest city, Yangon, Jolie and Suu Kyi witnessed first-hand the conditions the women live in, mostly low-cost hostels.\nIt is Jolie\u2019s first visit to Myanmar, which only recently emerged from decades of military rule.\nJolie, who is a special envoy for the U.N.
