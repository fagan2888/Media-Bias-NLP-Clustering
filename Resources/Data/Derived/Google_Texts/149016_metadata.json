Opponents are questioning his bona fides as an effective watchdog for the school district.\n\nSmarting from an attack ad, he asked us to set the record straight on a couple of issues.\n\nYes, White voted against member April Griffin's idea to hire an auditor who would report directly to the school board. The first time he voted no, he said he had concerns about the legality of the arrangement. This did not please Griffin, who had hoped for his support. The second time, he said he did not want to support the hiring of a bureaucrat.\n\nNow for the allegation in the attack ad: That White voted for bonuses for Superintendent MaryEllen Elia at a time when front-line school district employees were not getting bonuses.\n\nWrong on both counts, White says.\n\nThose bonuses Elia gets are written into her contract, which was negotiated in 2005. Board members have nothing to do with them. What's more, White suggested in 2012 that the board might want to renegotiate Elia's contract. But that idea went nowhere because Elia is grandfathered into a three-year contract that rolls over annually for an additional year. Because the state no longer allows such contracts, board members soon concluded that Elia would have no motivation to renegotiate.\n\nIt's also not technically correct to say front-line employees have not received bonuses. The district did find money for pay adjustments when the state increased the percentage employees would have to contribute to their pension fund.\n\nWhite faces Rick Cochran and Janet Dougherty in the Republican primary on Aug. 26. A self-described social conservative, he's found opportunities at school board meetings to speak out against Common Core and Obamacare and in favor of pro-family values in the schools.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stacy White is not having an easy time in his bid for the seat on the Hillsborough County Commission.
