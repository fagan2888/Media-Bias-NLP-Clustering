turned into a left foot amputation, Catherine Porter was ready to fight back when she was offered the same devastating option for her right foot.\n\nDiabetics are losing their feet for want of preventative foot care, something the country\u2019s premiers promised \u201caction\u201d on more than three years ago, health-care experts say.\n\nLike most Ontario diabetics who undergo an amputation \u2014 about 2,000 people every year \u2014 Porter developed a foot ulcer that wouldn\u2019t heal.\n\nThe Toronto resident suffers from diabetic-related peripheral neuropathy, which makes it difficult to feel wounds in her extremities, and without proper screening or awareness of \u201coff-loading\u201d devices such as casts or braces that help foot ulcers heal faster, her wound eventually got so bad doctors amputated her left foot and then her leg to the knee.\n\n\u201cAn injury that went unnoticed,\u201d Porter said of the \u201cbump\u201d to her foot. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t heal because I couldn\u2019t get off of it.\u201d\n\nA cut from a shower drain in 2013 developed into a two-inch deep open sore on the bottom of her right foot, and her surgeon again recommended amputation.\n\nThis time, Porter refused and received repeated rounds of antibiotics and a specially constructed boot to keep the pressure off her foot.\n\n\u201cWe spent three years trying to save it,\u201d Porter said. \u201cAnd we saved it.\u201d\n\nA report released by the country\u2019s premiers in 2012 quotes grim facts from the Canadian Diabetes Foundation: 345,000 diabetics will develop a related foot ulcer in their lifetime, diabetics are 23 times more likely to be hospitalized for a limb amputation, and 85% of those amputations are caused by non-healing foot ulcers.\n\nThe report was titled From Innovation to Action, but the action part has been slow to materialize.\n\nThe Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario (RNAO) and the Canadian Association of Wound Care (CAWC) reminded the provincial government this week of the need to fund annual preventative foot-care assessments and off-loading devices, which are far cheaper and less traumatic than surgical solutions.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars to take off a foot, but not $100 to keep it on,\u201d Toronto resident Allan Jarrell said.\n\nJarrell experienced a deep and serious foot ulcer shortly after being diagnosed with diabetes, and the costs quickly added up.\n\nThree-times-a-week home visits, weekly treatments at the wound clinic, $250 out of pocket for an air cast and months and months before it was properly healed, he said.\n\nMany people can\u2019t afford the devices, on top of all the other costs related to being a diabetic, and will simply hope a wound heals, he said.\n\n\u201cDenial is a wonderful place.\u201d\n\nRNAO executive director Doris Grinspun said the premiers didn\u2019t follow through in any significant way despite their strong words in 2012.\n\nProvincial governments are still more willing to fund a $70,000 amputation than ongoing preventative care, she said.\n\nOntario Health Minister Dr. Eric Hoskins said this week he has directed Health Quality Ontario to establish a wound care group to develop quality standards for the treatment of pressure ulcers, leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers.\n\nFINDINGS FROM THE 2012 PREMIERS\u2019 REPORT\n\n\u2014 Diabetics are prone to foot ulcers that can develop from a small unnoticed cut to become a life-threatening infection or gangrene\n\n\u2014 Most diabetic foot ulcers and amputations can be prevented with education, monitoring and treatment\n\n\u2014 Preventative care is the preferred option to avoid the \u201cphysical and emotional trauma\u201d of amputations\n\n\u2014 Diabetic foot ulcers cost the Canadian health-care system more than $150 million a year\n\n\u2014 RNAO guidelines call for foot assessments at least once a year, if not more often for those at high risk, foot-care education and professionally fitted footwear\n\n(Source: From Innovation to Action: The First Report of the Health Care Innovation Working Group)",
