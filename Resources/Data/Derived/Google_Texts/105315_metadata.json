The number has obviously exceeded expectations,\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said at a news briefing.\n\n\"To make further improvements, we are doing several things at once, including adding server capacity and making software changes to make the system more efficient to handle higher volume.\"\n\nIT experts told Reuters last week they believed flaws in the system's architecture, not traffic alone, contributed to the problems of the first week.\n\nOne expert told Reuters the site's design triggered too many requests to the server simultaneously, which created a situation similar to when hackers attack a site, known as a distributed denial of service attack.\n\nCarney said a particular component of the system within the account registration function was not able to handle the high volume, causing problems for consumers at the registration process.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \"has put up a gate at the front end of the system that places visitors into a waiting room and lets them in at a particular pace, so that the surge in volume does not cause the problems that it caused in the past,\" Carney said.\n\n\"Thus far, we've reduced waiting room times by a third and are increasingly moving more users through the system, but we're not satisfied with the performance.\"\n\nIn response to the early glitches, supporters of the law have pointed to the fact that enrollment in the online healthcare exchanges is set to run through the end of March, allowing for several months to work out the kinks.\n\nIncluding separate websites run by individual states alone, the exchanges are expected to enroll 7 million Americans next year, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates.
