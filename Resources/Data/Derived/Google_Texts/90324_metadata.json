If these claims, which lie in the Arkansas River, were to be mined, there could be significant environmental impact.\n\n\u201cMining on the river could destroy the pristine water quality and scenery that has made Browns Canyon one of the top rafting and fishing destinations in the country,\u201d Colorado\u2019s Sen. Mark Udall, a Democrat, said in a prepared statement.\n\n\u201cIt also could be disastrous for Chaffee County, its economy and the businesses that count on the river,\u201d Udall said.\n\nUdall is the latest member of Colorado\u2019s congressional delegation to push for protections for Browns Canyon. Recently, he introduced a bill to have the area designated a national monument.\n\nBefore Udall, then-Sens. Wayne Allard, a Republican, and Ken Salazar, a Democrat, teamed up to seek a wilderness designation for Browns. Republican Rep. Joel Hefley pushed the idea, which was ultimately unsuccessful, in the House.\n\nFor the past 18 months, Udall has been carefully building consensus among local interests for national monument designation.\n\nNotably absent from the list of supporters at this point is Rep. Doug Lamborn, a Colorado Springs Republican who took Hefley\u2019s seat and represents the area. We would hope he could find a way to support this idea.\n\nThe preferred route to the designation, which would encompass 22,000 acres between Salida and Buena Vista, would be congressional action.\n\nIf federal lawmakers can\u2019t get their act together, then President Obama could use his power under the Antiquities Act to make the area a national monument.\n\nThough the president would be well within his legal authority to take the action, there has been a history of tension between the executive and legislative branches over such designations.\n\nThat\u2019s why congressional designation is preferable. If it has a stamp of approval from federal lawmakers, then there\u2019s less chance a subsequent Congress would try to undo the designation.\n\nBrowns is a beautiful part of Colorado. It deserves the permanent protection that a national monument designation would confer upon this special place.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mining claims are reasons to protect Browns Canyon", "title": "Mining claims are reasons to protect Browns Canyon", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/20/mining-claims-are-reasons-to-protect-browns-canyon/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131220__20131222_Z00_OP22E_BROWNSp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131220__20131222_Z00_OP22E_BROWNSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-20T12:24:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T11:01:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0869\"", "article_summary": "It deserves the permanent protection that a national monument designation would confer upon this special place.\n\u201cIt also could be disastrous for Chaffee County, its economy and the businesses that count on the river,\u201d Udall said.\nThe designation of Browns Canyon as a national monument is long overdue.\nFor the past 18 months, Udall has been carefully building consensus among local interests for national monument designation.\nThat\u2019s why congressional designation is preferable."}
