And the ringer on loud.\n\n\u201cTake out your cellphones, turn them on, hold them up!\u201d Penn Jillette, the larger, speaking half of the magic duo says as he kicks off their new show on Broadway.\n\nWhat happens next seems to betray physics. It involves a volunteer divorced from his phone, a bucket, a sealed box found in the audience and a dead fish, out from which the phone miraculously reappears.\n\nThe fish \u2014 like the trick \u2014 is as fresh as ever.\n\nCelebrating 40 years of performing together, Penn & Teller\u2019s new show that opened Sunday at the Marquis Theatre celebrates new and old tricks, and, as typical, mixes in plenty of comedy that bursts the traditional pretensions of stage magic.\n\nThere\u2019s a subversive whiff to their show, whether it\u2019s exploding myths about the metal detectors used by the Transportation Security Administration or vilifying so-called clairvoyants who prey on vulnerable people.\n\n\u201cThe people who claim these powers are liars, cheaters, swindlers and rip-off artists. The tricks themselves are evil, immoral \u2014 and I know how to do them all,\u201d Penn says.\n\nThe show\u2019s tent poles have the pair pulling a rabbit out of a hat, sawing a woman in half and making what they call an African Spotted Pygmy Elephant vanish.\n\nBut there\u2019s something here for everyone, including a nail-gun bit that will make you wince, some clever close-up magic and a trick that has Teller swallowing needles and the audience gagging. Volunteers are often needed onstage and treated with respect.\n\nThese are a pair of self-acknowledged skeptics and libertarians who believe in tricks \u2014 not real risk \u2014 and don\u2019t believe in using plants in the audience \u2014 \u201cWe believe it is just too expensive,\u201d Penn jokes. They tease the crowd like trained strippers, revealing just enough, but not all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Review: Penn & Teller show plenty up their sleeves", "title": "Review: Penn & Teller show plenty up their sleeves", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Review: Penn & Teller show plenty up their sleeves", "title": "Review: Penn & Teller show plenty up their sleeves", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/13/review_penn_teller_show_plenty_up_their_sleeves/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/theater-review-penn-amp-teller-on-broadway.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Review: Penn & Teller show plenty up their sleeves", "title": "Review: Penn & Teller show plenty up their sleeves", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/theater-review-penn-amp-teller-on-broadway.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mark Kennedy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 At a time when most theater performers are paranoid about getting everyone to turn off their cellphones \u2014 hello, Patti LuPone \u2014 Penn & Teller want them on.\nThe tricks themselves are evil, immoral \u2014 and I know how to do them all,\u201d Penn says.\n\u201cTake out your cellphones, turn them on, hold them up!\u201d Penn Jillette, the larger, speaking half of the magic duo says as he kicks off their new show on Broadway.\nThese are a pair of self-acknowledged skeptics and libertarians who believe in tricks \u2014 not real risk \u2014 and don\u2019t believe in using plants in the audience \u2014 \u201cWe believe it is just too expensive,\u201d Penn jokes.\nBut there\u2019s something here for everyone, including a nail-gun bit that will make you wince, some clever close-up magic and a trick that has Teller swallowing needles and the audience gagging."}
