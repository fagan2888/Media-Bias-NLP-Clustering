Terry McAuliffe allegedly told a Democratic lawmaker that his daughter could land a top role with the state if he stayed in office and supported the governor\u2019s effort to expand Medicaid, The Washington Post reported on Thursday night.\n\nIn yet another twist in the ongoing Obamacare fight and a corruption controversy that began in June, the governor\u2019s top aide reportedly left a voicemail message for the Democrat, then-State Sen. Phillip Puckett, who was preparing to quit the General Assembly that month. Ultimately, Puckett resigned, thus giving the GOP at least temporary control of the state Senate that McAuliffe was counting on to support the expansion of health coverage in Virginia.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office \u201cwould be very eager to accommodate\u201d Puckett\u2019s daughter, the chief of staff, Paul Reagan, said in the recording, according to a transcript given to The Post.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe just need you really, we need you for the rest of your term and beyond, but in the immediate future, we need you to help us get this Medicaid deal through,\u201d Reagan added, according to the document.\n\nPuckett previously didn\u2019t seek a role within the state\u2019s tobacco commission amid bribery allegations that Republicans would trade him a job for himself and a judgeship for his daughter in exchange for his resignation. A federal investigation, which is still ongoing, began earlier this year after news of the alleged quid pro quo came to light.\n\nMcAuliffe originally denied to The Post that Reagan had made any potential job offers to Puckett and his daughter. But, after he was read a transcript of Reagan\u2019s message, McAuliffe later admitted that the call had occurred.\n\n\n\nMcAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy told msnbc in an email on Friday morning that \u201cthe governor was not aware of [Reagan\u2019s] actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the fight to expand health care to uninsured Virginians, I was overzealous and acted with poor judgment. I certainly regret this and will always try to achieve the high standards demanded by Gov. McAuliffe,\u201d Reagan said in a statement obtained by msnbc.\n\nThe Post reported that Coy indicated McAuliffe hadn\u2019t objected to Reagan\u2019s plan, and suggested that the possible role Reagan mentioned was not on the same level with what Republicans are accused of promising Puckett.\n\nReagan didn\u2019t deny leaving the message.\n\nPuckett had been a senator since 1998, but his district leans heavily Republican. It will be tough for Democrats to keep the seat in the midterm elections next month; the deal will likely permanently alter the make-up of Virginia\u2019s legislature. He was a key swing vote on Medicaid expansion, and ran on a platform involving the policy during his successful campaign last year.\n\nThe Medicaid expansion is largely funded by the federal government through Obamacare. Earlier this month, state House Republicans killed the bill to expand the health care program without giving it a formal vote. Had it passed, it would have provided 400,000 low-income Virginians with insurance. Similar to their congressional counterparts, the state\u2019s Republican lawmakers complained that the expansion was too costly.\n\nJane C.
