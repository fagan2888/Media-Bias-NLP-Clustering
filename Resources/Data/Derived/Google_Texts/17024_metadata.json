One of her postings is titled, \u201cMy push-up bra will help me get my man.\u201d\n\nSo much for presidential protocol, although the video has been viewed almost 24 million times.\n\nOther antics on GloZell\u2019s YouTube page include a video of her sitting in a tub full of milk and cereal, and another showing her take the \u201cOnion Challenge\u201d \u2014 she holds a fresh-cut onion up to her face and tries not to cry.\n\nOf course, GloZell has been a longtime support of Obama, as her video supporting Obamacare attests.\n\nTitled \u201cYour Higher Taxes Pay for My Healthcare,\u201d she boasts that she voted for Obama because \u201che black.\u201d Yes, it\u2019s satire, but it stings all the same when she laughs out loud as she tells viewers they should be working to pay for her health care, and that of her \u201cseven children.\u201d\n\nThis video was only viewed a paltry 1.8 million times.\n\nIf you plan to tune in to next Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address, perhaps this will help remind you that, in the end, the joke really is on you.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "In a move that his critics will say further proves that he\u2019s mailing it in at this point,\u00a0President Obama has agreed to do interviews with three\u00a0YouTube personalities following next week\u2019s State of the Union speech.
