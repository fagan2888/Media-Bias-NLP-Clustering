A man accused of groping an Ocean County Mall employee is now in Ocean County jail, Toms River police say.

Anthony Proto, 68, of Lakewood was arrested Tuesday, according to a release from police. He's charged with criminal sexual contact and he's being held on $10,000 bail.

Proto was arrested about 8 p.m., just hours after police released news of the incident and surveillance photos of their suspect.

Police said a man approached an 18-year-old woman Monday while she was working alone at an unnamed store at the mall.

He pulled her toward his body, kissed her and grabbed her breast, police say.
