He later said he was aware that his comment, dropped during a GBA meeting, could be easily \u201cmisunderstood.\u201d\n\n\u201cGenerally GBA meetings are dry, specialist affairs,\u201d Germany's The Local writes, \u201cwhere representatives from doctors\u2019 associations, statutory health insurers and hospitals discuss what treatments are effective for patients and value for money.\u201d Hecken made the comment in the midst of a debate over whether more psychotherapists should be included in a statutory healthcare provision.\n\nHecken later said that his comment was \u201cunfortunate\u201d and that he did not intend to make light of psychiatric illness, or \u201cto describe the use of alcohol as an effective alternative to psychotherapeutic treatment.\u201d He added that \u201cpersonally I do not see every disorder such as for example having occasional problems getting to sleep, as [a] pathological condition in need of immediate treatment \u2013 rather I think that sometimes the old home cure of a bottle of warm beer can help.\u201d\n\nGerman psychiatrists have been angered by his comments, saying Hecken is making light of psychiatric illnesses and stigmatizing people who do have severe mental issues. The controversial statement sparked a \u201cprotest letter\u201d that has been circulating among psychotherapists.\n\nIn a statement, Hecken emphasized that he was not trying to list alcohol as an alternative to psychotherapy. \u201cI \u2026 know and am aware, that there are significant interdependencies between alcohol consumption and psychological diseases, which are documented in studies,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why the last thing I want to do is to trivialize psychological diseases or to even describe alcohol consumption as an appropriate alternative for psychotherapeutic treatment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "beer, therapy, psychotherapy, josef hecken, german health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A German health official made a controversial statement about beer as an effective alternative to psychotherapy.", "title": "Beer As Good As Therapy?
