That was last year, however, and Blue's Egg fans came back with a vengeance, handing the title of best breakfast back over to the bustling breakfast place \u2013 and with over 100 votes to spare between it and second place.\n\nPerhaps last year Blue's Egg became a victim of its own success, with long waits for seating pushing some away. But it seems the love for Blue's Egg's scrumptious breakfast meats, platters, omelettes and more came back to life in 2015, resulting in an overwhelming win over its other competitors.\n\nAnd speaking of those other competitors, Dave Begel favorite Cafe at the Plaza finished comfortably in second place, Mad Rooster another 100 votes behind, and Engine Company No. 3 and Original Pancake House rounding out the voters' top picks.\n\nRunners up:\n\n2.
