Pixabay, public domain\n\nWe\u2019re told that mistakes are all part of the learning process, and that in the end, they're beneficial. However, new research finds that the issue is more complicated than commonly thought, and mistakes don't always help us learn.\n\nThe study, conducted by NYU researchers, found that when humans and monkeys made errors in decision-making, they slowed down their thinking processes significantly in an attempt to get it right the next time \u2014 but this didn\u2019t improve their levels of accuracy.\n\n\u201cOur research reveals that a combination of changes in the brain slow us down after mistakes,\u201d Braden Purcell, a post-doctoral fellow at NYU and author of the study, said in a press release. \u201cOne gathers more information for the decision to prevent repeating the same mistake again. A second change reduces the quality of evidence we obtain, which decreases the likelihood we will make an accurate choice. In the end, these two processes cancel each other out, meaning that the deliberative approach we take to avoid repeating a mistake neither enhances nor diminishes the likelihood we\u2019ll repeat it.\u201d\n\nResearchers analyzed humans and monkeys as they made decisions about the direction that dots would move on a computer screen. Some decisions were more difficult than others, Both humans and monkeys slowed down their decision-making processes after they made mistakes \u2014 a phenomenon called post-error slowing (PES). Past research has examined the exact moment in the brain when we realize we\u2019ve made a mistake; PES occurs right after the mistake as we try to avoid making one again.\n\nWhen the researchers measured brain activity during PES, they found that neural activity in the parietal cortex built more slowly, something that\u2019s linked to impaired quality of sensory evidence.\n\n\u201cPatients with ADHD or schizophrenia often do not slow down after errors and this has been interpreted as an impaired ability to monitor one\u2019s own behavior,\u201d Purcell said in the press release. \u201cOur results suggest that this absence of slowing may reflect much more fundamental changes in the underlying decision-making brain networks. By better understanding the neural mechanisms at work after we make a mistake, we can begin to see how these afflictions impair this process.\u201d\n\nWhile the study provides new information about the neural processes occurring during decision-making errors and PES, other research has examined the overall impact of making mistakes \u2014 and some scientists agree that they're helpful if dealt with properly. One 2014 study found that making errors and near-misses and learning from mistakes was associated with improved memory in the young and old. Other studies have shown that it all depends on how we consciously choose to react to the mistake that makes the difference \u2014 being open to learning from it will allow us to take constructive criticism.\n\nSource: Purcell B, Kiani R.
