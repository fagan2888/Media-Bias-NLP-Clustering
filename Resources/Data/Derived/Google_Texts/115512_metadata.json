That way they can get real-world work experience and learn how they might contribute in a meaningful way to society.\n\nThat was one of the suggestions The New Republic made last month in an article about how college-obsessed kids may be making big mistakes by packing their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s to the hilt with life experiences that have been funded and orchestrated by rich parents.\n\nRelated: How to Find a Job Without Looking for a Job\n\n\u201cColleges should put an end to r\u00e9sum\u00e9-stuffing by imposing a limit on the number of extracurriculars that kids can list on their applications,\u201d the article said. \u201cThey [the colleges] ought to place more value on the kind of service jobs that lower-income students often take in high school and that high achievers almost never do.\u201d\n\nIf you think your children or grandchildren should take a job for a year or two before applying for college \u2013 then they might as well aim for the best paying jobs out there. To help find the right fit, CareerBuilder and Economic Modeling Specialists International have found the best paying jobs for workers with high school diplomas, released in a new study Thursday morning.\n\nAs of this year, there are 115 occupations that require a high school diploma and pay $20 per hour or more on average, CareerBuilder noted. Of those, 30 percent typically require either short-term training or no on-the-job training.\n\nHere are the 10 highest-paying jobs for high school graduates requiring short-term or no training:\n\nTransportation, storage and distribution manager First-line supervisors of non-retail sales workers Gaming managers Real estate brokers First-line supervisors of construction trades and extraction workers First-line supervisors of mechanics, installers and repairers Legal support workers (not including paralegals, court reporters, title examiners or legal assistants) Postal service mail carriers Transit and railroad police Property, real estate and community association managers\n\nRelated: 10 Best Cities for Jobs That Let You Have a Life\n\nThe median hourly earnings for these 10 jobs range from $26 to $39.27, which is far better than the federal minimum wage of $7.25. None of these 10 jobs requires training, except for legal support workers, postal service mail carriers and transit and railroad police.\n\nMind you, these jobs may not be career destinations, but they\u2019re certainly a decent starting point.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A new survey by CareerBuilder details the best paying occupations for high school graduates.", "title": "The Best Paying Jobs for High School Graduates", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/14/Best-Paying-Jobs-High-School-Graduates", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07172013_High_Speed_Train_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/14/Best-Paying-Jobs-High-School-Graduates", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07172013_High_Speed_Train_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A new survey by CareerBuilder details the best paying occupations for high school graduates.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1b81\"", "article_summary": "To help find the right fit, CareerBuilder and Economic Modeling Specialists International have found the best paying jobs for workers with high school diplomas, released in a new study Thursday morning.\nAs of this year, there are 115 occupations that require a high school diploma and pay $20 per hour or more on average, CareerBuilder noted.\nInstead of volunteering in Africa or studying art history in Italy to build a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in the hope of nabbing a spot at an elite university, some high school graduates are taking full-time jobs.\nNone of these 10 jobs requires training, except for legal support workers, postal service mail carriers and transit and railroad police.\n\u201cThey [the colleges] ought to place more value on the kind of service jobs that lower-income students often take in high school and that high achievers almost never do.\u201dIf you think your children or grandchildren should take a job for a year or two before applying for college \u2013 then they might as well aim for the best paying jobs out there."}
