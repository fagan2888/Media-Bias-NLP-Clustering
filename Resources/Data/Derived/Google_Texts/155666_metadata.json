Rick Scott\u2018s Kabuki theater-style Commission on Healthcare and Hospital Funding as relevant experience to dealing with the Affordable Care Act and other complicated health care issues in Congress.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t always the case. In fact, just earlier this year Beruff said he knows \u201czero\u201d about health care, even after his tenure on the panel.\n\nThe millionaire homebuilder who gave some $121,000 to Scott\u2019s re-election campaign and state Republicans was tapped to lead the committee nonetheless, an arrangement that raised eyebrows.\n\nThe Charlotte Sun\u2019s editorial board, for instance, said Beruff\u2019s experience in health care was \u201cnonexistent,\u201d while the Tampa Bay Times opined the body\u2019s composition was \u201cridiculous\u201d for how replete it was with political allies with no knowledge of the subject.\n\nEvidently, Beruff once agreed with those assessments.\n\n\u201cI served as Chairman of the Florida Healthcare Commission for eight months. And when I was put on that task force \u2026 obviously I\u2019m a homebuilder what do I know about health care? Zero,\u201d Beruff told members of the Nokomis Osprey Venice Area Republican Club in March.\n\n\u201cI called up Governor Scott and I said, \u2018Governor, I know I don\u2019t know anything about this \u2026 [W]e were immediately tagged in the media as loyalists, Governor\u2019s cronies, like we didn\u2019t have our own mind,\u201d said Beruff, in remarks which are archived online.\n\nBut apparently he has since changed his tone, citing the experience as proof of he has what it takes to replace Obamacare if repealed by a GOP President and Congress.\n\nBeruff said to a questioner, \u201cI think the private sector has to play a big part\u201d in coming up with a viable alternative to the ACA, flashing his newfound expertise.\n\n\u201cI recently finished as the chairman of the health care commission in Florida and I brought in some really great speakers from across the country, and political affiliation had nothing to do with it, but they all said 35 to 50 percent waste in the health care delivery system,\u201d Beruff continued.\n\nPerhaps he would \u201cbring in some really great speakers\u201d to determine where he stands on health care issues as a U.S. Senator?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "U.S. Senate candidate\u00a0Carlos Beruff\u00a0touts his time as Chair of Gov.\u00a0Rick Scott\u2018s Kabuki theater-style\u00a0Commission on Healthcare and Hospital Funding\u00a0as relevant experience to dealing with the Affordable Care Act and other complicated health care issues in Congress.
