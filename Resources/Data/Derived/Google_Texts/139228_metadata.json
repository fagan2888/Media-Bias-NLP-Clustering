Ted Cruz of Texas in the battle over next month\u2019s Iowa GOP caucuses. The controversial businessman has lately been raising doubts about whether the freshman senator is a \u201cnatural born citizen\u201d and thus eligible to serve as president.\n\nA Quinnipiac University survey shows Trump and Cruz locked in the lead among Iowa Republicans likely to turn out for the caucuses, with Trump at 31 percent and Cruz at 29 percent. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is a distant third with 15 percent, and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson is at just 7 percent.\n\nRelated: Cruz Won\u2019t Send \u2018Jack Boots\u2019 to Deport 11.3 Million Illegal Immigrants\n\nA Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist University poll released Sunday also shows a very tight race for first place, but with Cruz holding a slight lead over Trump, 28 percent to 24 percent, and Rubio trailing with 13 percent.\n\nIn both surveys, the margin of error of the polls is plus or minus 4 percentage points, which means that the race between Trump and Cruz is a statistical dead heat and could go either way in the final days.\n\nCruz, 44, is reviled on Capitol Hill, where he has repeatedly undercut and insulted GOP leaders and fomented the 2013 government shutdown, but among religious conservatives and anti-establishment Republicans in Iowa and elsewhere, he is a hero who gets high marks. According to the latest Quinnipiac poll, Cruz has a 75 percent favorability rating with 17 percent unfavorable, compared with Trump\u2019s 61/34 favorable/unfavorable score.\n\nOn matters of character, Iowa Republicans overwhelmingly give the nod to Cruz. They praise him for his honesty, trustworthiness, personal values and concern for others. But Trump, 69, does better on the questions of who would be best able to handle the economy, combat terrorism and address immigration.\n\n\u201cThe Iowa Republican Caucuses are tight as a tick entering the final two weeks of the campaign. Voters like Sen. Ted Cruz better than Donald Trump and give him much higher scores for honesty, empathy, experience and for sharing their values,\u201d said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll. \u201cBut they see the New York businessman as better able to handle some key issues. Trump is way ahead on handling the economy and terrorism.\u201d\n\nRelated: 5 Reasons the Trump Immigration Plan Doesn\u2019t Pass the Reality Test\n\nCruz, a darling of evangelical Christians and far right conservatives, has just about everything riding on winning the first in the national presidential caucuses on Feb. 1, and until recently he appeared to be surging in the Hawkeye State. A first-place showing in Iowa would seal the Texan\u2019s reputation as an up and comer who is best positioned to pick up the conservative GOP mantle if Trump falters. And until recently, Cruz was careful not to join other Republican candidates in taking pot shots at Trump, saying he refused to be drawn into intra-party squabbling by the media.\n\nHowever, Trump has closed the gap between the two men with aggressive campaigning, a stepped-up ad campaign and on-the-ground organization. Just as Cruz was showing growing strength in Iowa thanks to his formidable debating and fundraising skills, Trump began to hammer him. He did it in part by raising questions about his eligibility to be president, casting doubt about his evangelical faith, denouncing Cruz\u2019s calls for ending government assistance to Iowa\u2019s ethanol industry, and even calling him a \u201cbit of a maniac\u201d last month.\n\nDuring an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Trump said the Texas senator was not qualified to be president because he doesn\u2019t have the right temperament and judgement to get things done. \u201cLook at the way he\u2019s dealt with the Senate, where he goes in there like a \u2014 you know, frankly like a little bit of a maniac,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou can\u2019t walk into the Senate, and scream, and call people liars, and not be able to cajole and get along with people.\u201d\n\nBy repeatedly raising the question of whether the Canadian-born Cruz might lack legal standing to serve as commander in chief, Trump has visibly rattled Cruz and sparked controversy within the media and on the campaign trail. Cruz\u2019s mother is native-born American and his father is a Cuban-born American who obtained U.S. citizenship. Cruz was born while his family was living in Calgary, Canada, nd he insists there is no doubt about his ability to serve as president.\n\nRelated: Republican Cruz pushes back on questions about his U.S. citizenship\n\nTrump, a notorious \u201cbirther\u201d who for years questioned whether President Obama was a native-born U.S. citizen, told a large crowd in Reno, Nev., Sunday night that Cruz\u2019s problem is actually a legal one, a \"cloud\" hanging over his head about whether his Canadian birthplace precludes him from being a \"natural born citizen.\" According to Trump the issue raises \"uncertainty\" if Cruz were to win the Republican nomination because Democrats would file lawsuits contesting his eligibility to serve as president.\n\nHe has \u201chelpfully\u201d suggested a number of times that Cruz seek a declaratory judgment from the courts before the campaign goes on much longer. And Trump assured the crowd that he knows lawsuits. \"Does anyone know more about litigation than Trump?\" he asked. \"I know a lot. I'm like a PhD in litigation.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A new poll released on Monday shows Donald Trump edging slightly ahead of Sen.", "title": "Trump Plays the Birther Card on Cruz -- and It\u2019s Working", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/11/Trump-Plays-Birther-Card-Cruz-and-It-s-Working", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01112016_Donald_Trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/11/Trump-Plays-Birther-Card-Cruz-and-It-s-Working", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/01112016_Donald_Trump.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A new poll released on Monday shows Donald Trump edging slightly ahead of Sen.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "According to the latest Quinnipiac poll, Cruz has a 75 percent favorability rating with 17 percent unfavorable, compared with Trump\u2019s 61/34 favorable/unfavorable score.\nA Quinnipiac University survey shows Trump and Cruz locked in the lead among Iowa Republicans likely to turn out for the caucuses, with Trump at 31 percent and Cruz at 29 percent.\n\u201cThe Iowa Republican Caucuses are tight as a tick entering the final two weeks of the campaign.\nJust as Cruz was showing growing strength in Iowa thanks to his formidable debating and fundraising skills, Trump began to hammer him.\nA new poll released on Monday shows Donald Trump edging slightly ahead of Sen.
