They point to the angry electorate, disarray and dysfunction within the Republican Party, but the best explanation is staring journalists in the mirror.\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s huge success in the presidential campaign is a direct result of the state of journalism in our country. In today\u2019s media environment, journalists crave a character like Donald Trump, which has led news organizations, particularly broadcast outlets, to virtually pave the road for Trump\u2019s drive to the White House, not simply by granting him unlimited airtime, but by failing to deliver enough quality reporting that truly informs the public.\n\nWe live in an age of personality-driven celebrity journalism, where the misdeeds of foul-mouthed housewives become news, where soft news morphs into hard news, where morning news programs serve to promote their network\u2019s entertainment shows.\n\nWe live in an age where partisan sniping masquerades as journalism, where entire networks are dedicated to mocking those who hold political views differing from the network\u2019s editorial stance, where on-air vitriol helps sets the tone for our political discourse.\n\nWe live in an age where journalists are dedicated to generating outrage. The question in editorial meetings is not, \u201cHow can we best inform our audience?\u201d Rather, editors and producers want to know, \u201cHow can we get viewers, listeners and readers angry? How can we generate heat so they\u2019ll keep watching, listening and reading?\u201d\n\nWe live in an age where the priority at most news organizations is no longer to enlighten the public; it\u2019s to attract and hold the audience. The concept of news as a prestige loss leader went out the window at the TV networks many years ago. Today, it\u2019s all about ratings and eyeballs. That\u2019s the case for virtually all news organizations struggling under the economic weight of an Internet that has vastly increased the flow of information but made its users think news is a commodity one need not pay for, since an endless supply of it is available gratis online.\n\nWe live in an age where political reporting is all about the horse race, not about issues that impact voters and determine the future of the nation. When was the last time you watched a story devoted entirely to policy positions? Given their scarcity, one has to actively search for policy stories, but how many Americans take the time to dig beneath the surface of the latest campaign news?\n\nEnter Donald Trump. He checks all the boxes above: a flashy celebrity with a larger than life personality and mouth, masterful at attracting attention, generating outrage and tapping into the electorate\u2019s anger. And never mind the issues; for him, it\u2019s all about the race.\n\nReporters and their editors know they\u2019re going to get an interesting story when the topic is Donald Trump. I certainly did the many times I interviewed him and reported on his business dealings. Donald\u2019s raison d\u2019etre is to win by getting the most, whether it\u2019s real estate, women, dollars or votes. He desperately wants to be bigger and better and let the world know it. Such proclamations from the mouth of The Donald make for juicy soundbites and strong ratings for those who broadcast them.\n\nConsequently, the media are flocking to Trump. The New York media\u2019s obsession with Trump has been going on for decades, as reporters have chronicled his rise in society, his ambitious building plans, his innumerable legal battles, his wealth, his companies\u2019 bankruptcies, his dalliances, sex life and marriages. Except now he\u2019s running for president. So when TV networks air his campaign appearances non-stop, and producers book him for interviews as frequently as possible, he\u2019s placed in the spotlight to the near exclusion of all other Republican candidates. This free media, of course, has allowed Trump to minimize his spending on campaign ads. The networks have granted Trump many multiples the airtime of other Republican candidates, not to elucidate the issues at stake in the presidential race, but to boost their own ratings. As CBS CEO Leslie Moonves put it at a recent investment conference, \u201cIt may not be good for America, but it\u2019s damn good for CBS. The money\u2019s rolling in.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yes, voters are angry and GOP is in disarray.
