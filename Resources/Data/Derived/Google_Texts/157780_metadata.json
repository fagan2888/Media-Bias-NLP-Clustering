UnitedHealthcare\u2018s ads are a common sight on TV this time of year, and it bills itself as the only Medicare supplement plan endorsed by AARP.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t necessarily find the best deal for yourself watching TV advertisements,\u201d said Gavin Magor, senior analyst for Weiss Ratings in Palm Beach Gardens.\n\nFor example, three companies with equal or better financial-strength ratings from Weiss offer lower premiums for Medicare Plan A policies than UnitedHealthcare, a Weiss report for a sample customer in Palm Beach Gardens calculates.\n\nTo keep things in perspective, UnitedHealthcare stacks up pretty well on price against more than three dozen competitors in a number of categories \u2014 such as Plan F policies, where only one company has a lower premium, the Weiss report indicates.\n\n\u201cOur plans provide members value and peace of mind, which is why more Medicare beneficiaries choose UnitedHealthcare than any other company,\u201d a UnitedHealthcare statement to The Palm Beach Post said. \u201cMedicare is not one size fits all. We encourage beneficiaries to evaluate their coverage options during the Open Enrollment Period so they select a plan that best meets their needs for the year ahead.\u201d\n\nUnitedHealthcare is apparently not feeling peace of mind about some of its insurance plans that are different from its Medicare supplement business. The company grabbed headlines this month for saying it may leave Affordable Care Act exchanges within two years, citing concerns about profitability there.\n\nWeiss has its own economic aims \u2014 it wants to sell reports to people who buy insurance \u2014 but says its ratings are consumer-oriented and it does not take money from insurers.\n\nAn AARP spokesman declined to say how much the organization receives in royalties from UnitedHealthcare, but the most recent IRS Form 990 records available show non-profit AARP reported royalties of $762.6 million in 2013, more than half its revenue of $1.3 billion. That\u2019s up from $723. 3 million in royalties the previous year.\n\nThe money includes a portion of the premiums collected by AARP-endorsed insurers in fields including health and auto, along with royalties from other ventures such as credit cards.\n\n\u201cRoyalty revenue realized from branded products is used to support AARP\u2019s mission to serve the needs of those 50-plus through education, programs and advocacy,\u201d said AARP spokesman Mark Bagley.\n\nAs for what constitutes the best option for seniors, he said, \u201cthe features of Medigap coverage plans \u2013- as with most types of insurance \u2014 vary considerably, and consumers should carefully choose the plan most suited to their personal situation and individual needs. This kind of critical evaluation is what AARP publicly advises during each and every open enrollment period.\u201d\n\nRetiree Charles Bowen of Okeechobee said he appreciates many services AARP provides, and its endorsement of health insurance (UnitedHealthcare) and car insurance (Hartford) influenced his decision to buy from those companies.\n\nBut he said he never heard a response when he wrote to AARP in 2013 about concerns with UnitedHealthcare related to getting a wheelchair his wife Vivian needed. They wound up shopping around and choosing other insurers for health and car, carefully looking at price and other factors that may change year to year.\n\n\u201cYou have to keep up with it all the time,\u201d Bowen said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Protecting Your Pocket", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://protectingyourpocket.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2015/11/30/aarp-gets-762m-from-royalties-do-seniors-get-best-insurance-deal/", "image": "https://cmgpbpprotectingyourpocket.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/life_health-provide-insure_.jpg?w=300", "type": "article", "description": "Senior advocacy organization AARP receives $762.6 million a year -- more than half its total revenue of $1.3 billion -- from royalties on everything from health and car insurance deals to credit cards, records reviewed by The Palm Beach Post show.\r\n\r\nThat may be healthy for its bottom line, but its endorsed insurance plans are not always the best deals for consumers, groups who analyze choices in the market say.\r\n\r\nTake Medicare...", "title": "AARP gets $762M from royalties.
