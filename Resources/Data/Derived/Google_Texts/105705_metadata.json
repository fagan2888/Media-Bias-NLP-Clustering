According to Markstein, the methodology is a breakthrough in its own right, as it creates conditions that are \"difficult-to-impossible\" to achieve in petri dishes. Using this model, they tested a sample of 80 current chemotherapy drugs obtained from the National Cancer Institute.\n\n\"We systematically fed the FDA-approved drugs to the flies and found that 14 suppressed tumor growth in the intestine,\u201d Markstein said in a press release. \u201cThis was a great result, validating the relevance of flies as a clinical model. It was also very interesting, however, that we found that half these tumor-suppressing drugs had the opposite effect on the non-tumor stem cells, causing them to over-proliferate.\u201d\n\nThat said, this rapid division of stem cells does not necessarily spur new tumor development. But for a patient with the right genetic background, some of these drugs could significantly raise the risk of cancer recurrence.\n\nAccording to World Cancer Research Fund International, there were an estimated 14.1 million cancer cases globally in 2012. Lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer accounted for nearly half of all diagnoses for both sexes. While the rate of diagnoses appears to be rising, the number of cancer deaths has decreased significantly over the past two decades.\n\nThe researchers are confident that the findings as well as the method will benefit future drug discovery and development. Not only is the finding of clinical interest,\u201d Markstein said, \u201cbut with this study we used an emerging new non-traditional tool for assessing drugs using stem cells in the fruit fly gut.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "cancer drugs, stem cells, cancer recurrence, drosophilia fly", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Several FDA-approved cancer drugs induce an overproliferation of stem cells that can lead to new tumor growth, a new study finds.", "title": "Do Some Cancer Drugs Actually Cause Tumors?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-approved-cancer-drugs-may-actually-induce-tumors-could-therapy-raise-risk-cancer-recurrence", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/10/stem-cells.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Several FDA-approved cancer drugs induce an overproliferation of stem cells that can lead to new tumor growth, a new study finds.", "title": "Do Some Cancer Drugs Actually Cause Tumors?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-approved-cancer-drugs-may-actually-induce-tumors-could-therapy-raise-risk-cancer-recurrence", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/10/stem-cells.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/10/stem-cells.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Conditions", "published_time": "2014-03-10T15:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-10T15:00:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Several FDA-approved cancer drugs induce an overproliferation of stem cells that can lead to new tumor growth, a new study finds."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd20dd\"", "article_summary": "Lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer accounted for nearly half of all diagnoses for both sexes.\nSeveral FDA-approved cancer drugs induce an overproliferation of stem cells that can lead to new tumor growth, a new study finds.\nBut for a patient with the right genetic background, some of these drugs could significantly raise the risk of cancer recurrence.\nA new research method has revealed that a number of cancer drugs may lead to tumor recurrence, illuminating a counterintuitive factor behind the disease that is expected to kill nearly 600,000 Americans in 2014.\n\"We systematically fed the FDA-approved drugs to the flies and found that 14 suppressed tumor growth in the intestine,\u201d Markstein said in a press release."}
