In many cases across the nation, the health care system hasn\u2019t been providing the most effective or efficient care.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to do a bit of soul-searching in primary care because we weren\u2019t delivering the goods very well,\u201d said Kevin Grumbach, MD, chair of UCSF\u2019s Department of Family and Community Medicine and co-director of the UCSF Center for Excellence in Primary Care.\n\nTop 8 Trends in Health Sciences Patient-centered medical homes was chosen by UCSF experts as one of the top areas to watch for 2014. Read more about what other areas made the list.\n\n\u201cIt was hard to get appointments, and we weren\u2019t meeting all the patients\u2019 needs, especially if you look at diabetes care and rates of preventative cancer screening,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just say we need to try harder; we need to rethink the system. So that\u2019s behind this push to rethink what the roles of people are on the provider team.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly, studies suggest that a more team-based approach to care could be a big part of the solution. UC San Francisco research has been key in showing the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the \u201cpatient-centered medical home,\u201d and in driving implementation of this model in multiple centers at San Francisco General Hospital.\n\nInstead of the primary care physician trying to do everything in a 20-minute appointment, a whole team of health care providers is responsible for the patient\u2019s care \u2013 from nurses to doctors to community health workers to mental health specialists to pharmacists. The team works together to anticipate the patient\u2019s needs, communicate their findings with each other, and make sure no aspect of the patient\u2019s health slips through the cracks.\n\nKevin Grumbach, MD\n\nFrom the patient\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s a one-stop shopping experience: In a single doctor\u2019s visit, a patient could receive treatment from his or her primary care doctor, do a preventative screening with a nurse and a technician, and visit with a mental health specialist. In this approach, more is more \u2013 but it actually costs less.\n\nA 2014 study by the Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative, a national coalition of health care providers and other supporters of the medical home concept, found that this model decreased health care costs by about 60 percent, in large part by reducing the number of emergency visits.\n\nAn Idea Born from Problem-Solving\n\nThe patient-centered medical home isn\u2019t a new idea.\n\nThe concept originally arose from caring for children with chronic illnesses; these patients and their families often see multiple physicians, have complex treatment plans and require myriad tests. So before seeing the day\u2019s patients that day, the doctors, nurses, mental health specialists, medical assistants and pharmacists would huddle to discuss any upcoming needs.\n\nKimberlee Honda poses with a young patient at SFGH.\n\nThe Pediatric Asthma Clinic at SFGH has been using this team-based approach for over a decade.\n\nOn a recent morning, Kimberlee Honda, FNP, director of the Pediatric Asthma Clinic held a brief huddle with her team, including behavioral health specialists, a nutritionist, nurse practitioners, community health workers and social workers.\n\nOne community health worker brought up a concern about a young patient coming in later that day: He\u2019s living in a house with significant triggers like dust and mold.\n\nIf an environmental issue like old carpet is suspected, the clinic would send a community health worker to the child\u2019s home to evaluate. The clinic could help the family write a letter asking the landlord to change out the carpet, or even issue a letter directly. The providers can also involve a team lawyer if they need to escalate the situation.\n\n\u201cWe have to treat asthma in context. If something is going on in the family or the home setting, we make sure it\u2019s addressed first,\u201d said Honda.\n\nThe team also has social workers who can help families address other needs, and education specialists who can advocate for students with special needs, including attending parent-teacher meetings at school.\n\nClick on the image to view a larger version.\n\nTreating all aspects of a patient\u2019s health is a key part of patient-centered medical homes. Just down the street, primary care providers at SFGH\u2019s Family Health Center are moving toward this model.\n\nAbout a year ago, the providers fully incorporated behavioral health specialists onto the team, which has been a \u201cbreakthrough,\u201d Grumbach said. For example, he said, if he had a patient who was depressed, her son was in a gang and her husband was drinking, \u201cthere was usually this sense of \u2018oh my goodness, I have 20 minutes, how am I going to begin to address this?\u2019\u201d\n\nNow he can bring the patient down the hall to talk with a therapist on the spot. This lets Grumbach spend his time treating the patient\u2019s health issues he\u2019s trained for, and rely on other team members to handle issues in their area of expertise.\n\nTeaching Teamwork for Better Health Care Health care providers go through intensive training to become a pharmacist, dentist, social worker or physical therapist. But training to work on a health care team? Not so much. \"There\u2019s a big push for interprofessional collaboration, but historically we haven't trained students to work in this environment. That's why we've been developing this course,\u201d said Angel Chen, RN, MSN, CPNP, and vice chair of UCSF\u2019s Department of Family Health Care Nursing. UCSF has created the first online interprofessional course for health professional students around the globe to prepare the next generation of care providers. The course, which begins Sept. 15 through Coursera, covers five areas vital to the team game plan: collaboration, team roles, communication, conflict management and negotiation and leadership and team membership. Learn more\n\nLetting All Providers Shine\n\nThat\u2019s another strength of the team-based model: It allows everyone on the team from pharmacists to medical assistants to nurses to perform to the fullest capacity of their training.\n\nThis is especially true for nurses, who are highly trained in patient care and other specialties.\n\n\u201cThe team-based approach provides roles for nurses for which they are uniquely prepared. The approach is highly collaborative and requires excellent communication skills on the part of all the team members,\u201d said Kathy Dracup, RN, PhD, dean emeritus of the UCSF School of Nursing.\n\n\u201cThe patient-centered medical home provides a role for nurse practitioners in caring for patients who have a relatively stable chronic disease, but still need routine care and attention.\u201d\n\nShonul Jain, MD, director of SFGH\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Center, says the nurse\u2019s role is particularly important in implementing team-based cared in an academic setting, in which a team may include some physicians who are only in the clinic for one day a week because they also teach and do research. Having nurses on the team helps provide critical consistency of care.\n\n\u201cThe patient is owned by the whole team \u2013 it\u2019s not just the primary care physician\u2019s patient; it\u2019s our patient. So the idea behind the patient-centered medical home is to really give the nurses more of a role in patient care management,\u201d said Jain.\n\nThat consistency and care comes across to both providers and patients alike.\n\nTreating the Whole Patient\n\nMargo Vener, MD, says after 20 years of working at the Family Health Center, now with the team-based model, she really relies on her coworkers.\n\n\u201cIt used to be that you would just work with whatever staff person happened to be here that day,\u201d Vener said. \u201cYou often didn\u2019t know their names, and patients didn\u2019t either. Patients would say \u2018oh, I saw that nice lady with glasses last time.\u2019\u201d\n\nGuadalupe Lisea, a medical evaluations assistant, discusses her patients for the day with Brigitte Watkins, resident, and the team at the Family Health Center.

If they have a question between visits, they call her. If their appointment isn\u2019t right, they call Grace.\u201d\n\nWhile her clinic mainly treats the urban underserved, Vener says the patient-centered medical home is a good model for providing care for everyone.\n\n\u201cThe human connection makes a difference in helping patients feel cared for. It\u2019s not just a system. That\u2019s the team part. They feel like they\u2019ve got a family here.\u201d\n\nTop photo: The green team at the Family Health Center at San Francisco General Hospital discusses their approach for the patients coming in that afternoon.
