Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco this week. Humana said \u201cit will not opine on any financial results or expectations for 2015 or 2016 at this conference beyond those listed below.\u201d\n\nHumana will report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 10.\n\nThe insurer also said in the filing that it expects to lose between 200,000 and 300,000 clients this year in its individual commercial segment, which includes those it had gained through the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\nSome health insurers, including Humana, had said late last year that they\u2019re struggling to make a profit on new customers they\u2019ve gained through the Affordable Care Act and are re-evaluating how they can continue to participate. Humana said at the time that it would abandon some of its products in 2016, which would affect about 100,000 current customers.\n\nHumana also said it expects to gain about 110,000 customers for its individual Medicare Advantage plans this year. It is projecting a loss of about 120,000 customers in its group Medicare Advantage plans \u201cdue to the previously disclosed loss of a large account that moved to a private exchange.\u201d\n\nIn its stand-alone prescription drug plan, the company expects to gain about 315,000 customers this year.\n\nAetna, the insurance company that has proposed acquiring Humana for $37 billion, also will participate in the San Francisco conference.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/browserconfig.xml?v=PYYa6y0aQv", "description": "Humana\u00a0\u00a0expects to lose between 200,000 and 300,000 clients this year in its individual commercial segment, which includes those gained through the ACA.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Insider Louisville", "description": "Humana\u00a0\u00a0expects to lose between 200,000 and 300,000 clients this year in its individual commercial segment, which includes those gained through the ACA.", "title": "Humana: Claims related to Obamacare will exceed premiums collected - Insider Louisville", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 603, "identifier": "http://insiderlouisville.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-08-at-3.40.49-PM.png", "height": 425}, "updated_time": "2016-01-10T10:22:28-04:00", "url": "http://insiderlouisville.com/business/humana-claims-obamacare-exceed-premiums/", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1496697903875229}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://i2.wp.com/insiderlouisville.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/cropped-favicon.png?fit=270%2C270", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/InsiderLouisville", "section": "Business", "tag": "Humana", "published_time": "2016-01-10T10:21:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-10T10:22:28-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3974\"", "article_summary": "Humana says its medical claims related to Affordable Care Act-compliant plans will exceed the premiums it has collected, but the company still is determining the magnitude of the loss.\nAetna, the insurance company that has proposed acquiring Humana for $37 billion, also will participate in the San Francisco conference.\nHumana released the information in advance of the J.P.
