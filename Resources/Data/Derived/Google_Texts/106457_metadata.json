Conservatives are sick and tired of business as usual in Washington, and we\u2019re not going to take it anymore.\n\nDeMint, first elected to Congress in 1999, said he decided to run for office to \u201cmove dollars and decisions\u201d back to the American people. But, he said, he learned quickly that Republican leaders instead were more concerned with securing votes.\n\nDeMint, who took over The Heritage Foundation in 2013, praised grassroots activists for helping to bring conservative leaders to Washington, D.C., but criticized the GOP for wanting \u201cnothing to do\u201d with them in 2012.\n\nConservatives, he said, went on to launch a nationwide effort to defund Obamacare in 2013 and helped Republicans take back the House and the Senate during the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nDeMint is considered a leader of the tea party movement that first brought senators such as Ted Cruz, R-Texas; Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; and Mike Lee, R-Utah, to Washington, D.C. The same movement helped lead to the 2014 primary defeat of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., and the resignation last year of House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio.\n\n\u201cThey started out to take us down, but that\u2019s not what happened,\u201d DeMint said, \u201cbecause this force is growing rapidly. \u2026 When Republicans run on bold, positive, conservative ideas, they win.\u201d\n\nWithout speaking specifically of the Republicans who entered the presidential race, DeMint praised candidates for \u201crunning on conservative ideas\u201d and \u201cstanding with the hardworking, tax-paying, middle-class Americans.\u201d\n\nHe also touted Heritage\u2019s theme of \u201cOpportunity for All, Favoritism to None,\u201d saying:\n\nIf Americans know we really believe it, they will support our ideas. This is our cry. Conservatives ideas will achieve the promise of the American dream. Conservative policies will make life better for every American.\n\nRunning through Saturday, CPAC offers conservatives across the country an opportunity to gather with fellow activists and leaders for speeches, panels, exhibits, and other activities at Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center just outside Washington, D.C., at Maryland\u2019s National Harbor.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Conservatives are sick and tired of business as usual in Washington, and we\u2019re not going to take it anymore,\u201d the Heritage Foundation president said.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"Conservatives are sick and tired of business as usual in Washington, and we\u2019re not going to take it anymore,\u201d the Heritage Foundation president said.", "title": "DeMint: Conservatives Who Run on Conservative Ideas Win", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160304_DeMintCPAC.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-08T15:58:55+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1VX0GSg"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\"Conservatives are sick and tired of business as usual in Washington, and we\u2019re not going to take it anymore,\u201d the Heritage Foundation president said.", "title": "DeMint: Conservatives Who Run on Conservative Ideas Win", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160304_DeMintCPAC.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2016-03-04T19:11:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-08T15:58:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Jim DeMint, Ted Cruz, Marco, Rubio, Mike Lee, Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, Heritage Foundation, conservative movement"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2226\"", "article_summary": "Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint praised conservative leaders and activists Friday for espousing policies that help conservative candidates win.\n\u201cWhen Republicans run on bold, positive, conservative ideas, they win,\u201d DeMint said.\nConservatives ideas will achieve the promise of the American dream.\n\u2026 When Republicans run on bold, positive, conservative ideas, they win.\u201dWithout speaking specifically of the Republicans who entered the presidential race, DeMint praised candidates for \u201crunning on conservative ideas\u201d and \u201cstanding with the hardworking, tax-paying, middle-class Americans.\u201dHe also touted Heritage\u2019s theme of \u201cOpportunity for All, Favoritism to None,\u201d saying:If Americans know we really believe it, they will support our ideas.\nConservatives are sick and tired of business as usual in Washington, and we\u2019re not going to take it anymore."}
