Police have released the footage of two men \u00adresponsible for the shooting of Mr Vella, who they believe was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nThe 40-year-old tattooist had a minor criminal record from years ago and according to police there was no motive for anyone to want him dead.\n\n\"Mr Vella was just working in the wrong place,\" Detective Inspector Angelo Memmolo said. \"It is obvious from the video they meant to shoot someone - anyone - and didn't care who it was.\"\n\nOn a Saturday night in March two years ago, Mr \u00adVella and another tattoo artist were working on two clients inside the Pretty In Ink tattoo parlour on Victoria Rd, West Ryde. Two other staff and another customer were in the front reception area.\n\nAt 9.45pm, two men wearing hoodies and bandannas walked into the main studio via a rear entrance to the property. Without hesitation one of the men walked up to Mr Vella and shot him in the left shoulder while he was tattooing another male.\n\nThe shooting took place so quickly that no one else in the shop had time to react.\n\nMr Vella staggered out of the shop on to Victoria Rd, before collapsing on to the footpath, where paramedics frantically attempted to \u00adrevive him. He was pronounced dead on arrival at Royal North Shore Hospital.\n\nPolice believe Mr Vella was not the intended target, but merely the target of an \u00adattempt at intimidation.\n\n\"These two are callous grubs who didn't care at all about who they were shooting,\" said Det Insp Memmolo.\n\n\"From our investigations Mr Vella was an employee of the parlour and had no links himself to bikie gangs.\n\n\"His family, particularly his mother, want to know who did this and why, and we want the public to help us.\"\n\nAfter shooting Mr Vella, the assailant fired the weapon four more times before he and his accomplice fled through the rear door on to Gaza Rd. Beside the bullet that hit Mr Vella, none of the other four shots killed or \u00adinjured anyone else.\n\nThe two other parlour \u00ademployees working that night, and the three clients, all ran from the studio on to Victoria Rd and immediately called emergency services.\n\nThe CCTV camera was inside the parlour at West Ryde.\n\n\"We obviously want to talk to anyone who may know these two people, or have \u00adinformation about them,\" Det Insp Memmolo said. Other leads were also being followed.\n\nDetectives from the State Crime Command's homicide squad formed Strike Force Wootten to investigate the shooting and hope the release of the footage will prompt someone to come forward.\n\nCRIMESTOPPERS 1800 333 000", "article_metadata": {"description": "BEFORE he even had the chance to realise what was happening, tattoo artist Daniel Vella was dead, the victim of a callous hitman who didn't care who he shot - or even if they lived or died.", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "DailyTelegraph", "description": "BEFORE he even had the chance to realise what was happening, tattoo artist Daniel Vella was dead, the victim of a callous hitman who didn't care who he shot - or even if they lived or died.", "title": "Sydney tattooist Daniel Vella shot dead in his shop at point blank range", "url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/sydney-tattooist-daniel-vella-shot-dead-in-his-shop-at-point-blank-range/story-fni0cx12-1226766857094", "image": "http://content5.video.news.com.au/NDM_-_news.com.au/12/673/2419883758_promo209360058.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": {"identifier": "@dailytelegraph", "id": "@dailytelegraph"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": ",100000875899514", "app_id": 135086289853833}, "articleid": 1226766857094, "keywords": "fatal shooting, grey hooded-jumper, tattoo artist, tattoo parlour, Daniel Vella, homicide squad, front reception area, blue tracksuit pants, men responsible, Sydney tattooist, security cameras, said.Other leads, bikie gangs, minor criminal record, emergency services", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Sat Nov 23 17:13:32 EST 2013", "modified_time": "Sat Nov 23 17:13:32 EST 2013", "author": "Mark Morri Crime Editor"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0958\"", "article_summary": "Beside the bullet that hit Mr Vella, none of the other four shots killed or \u00adinjured anyone else.\nPolice believe Mr Vella was not the intended target, but merely the target of an \u00adattempt at intimidation.\nMr Vella staggered out of the shop on to Victoria Rd, before collapsing on to the footpath, where paramedics frantically attempted to \u00adrevive him.\nWithout hesitation one of the men walked up to Mr Vella and shot him in the left shoulder while he was tattooing another male.\n\"From our investigations Mr Vella was an employee of the parlour and had no links himself to bikie gangs."}
