The suit claims the current law violates the university\u2019s right to religious freedom in its provisions regarding coverage for contraceptives.\n\nIn a statement, Notre Dame\u2019s president said the refiling represents the University\u2019s right to \u201cto live out a religious freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have sought neither to prevent women from having access to services, nor even to prevent the government from providing them,\u201d said Notre Dame President Rev. John Jenkins.\n\nJenkins says officials from Notre Dame have been in discussions with government officials about the Affordable Care Act for more than a year. Jenkins says while he thinks the discussions were in good faith, ultimately the healthcare mandate still would require Notre Dame to forfeit its religious rights.\n\nNotre Dame filed the suit against Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and their departments.\n\nA federal judge dismissed the first lawsuit earlier this year saying the regulation was not ready for judicial review.\n\nFor more details on the lawsuit read the article \u201c5 Things to Know About Notre Dame\u2019s Contraceptives Lawsuit.\u201d\n\nNetwork Indiana contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The suit claims the current law violates the university\u2019s right to religious freedom in its provisions regarding coverage for contraceptives.", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.10", "og": {"site_name": "News - Indiana Public Media", "description": "The suit claims the current law violates the university\u2019s right to religious freedom in its provisions regarding coverage for contraceptives.", "title": "Notre Dame Refiles Contraceptives Lawsuit | News - Indiana Public Media", "url": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/notre-dame-refiles-affordable-care-act-lawsuit-59384/", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2012/02/basilica.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2012/02/basilica.jpg", "description": "The suit claims the current law violates the university\u2019s right to religious freedom in its provisions regarding coverage for contraceptives.", "site": "@wfiunews", "card": "summary", "title": "Notre Dame Refiles Contraceptives Lawsuit"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160118390716029}, "bitly-verification": "f9ab3b0a7f0c", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=yes,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd17c8\"", "article_summary": "The University of Notre Dame has refiled a lawsuit that challenges the constitutionality of portions of the Affordable Care Act.\nPhoto: Kymberly Janisch (Flickr) The contraceptives mandate has been particularly controversial in South Bend, Ind., the home of the University of Notre Dame.\nJenkins says officials from Notre Dame have been in discussions with government officials about the Affordable Care Act for more than a year.\nNotre Dame filed the suit against Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and their departments.\nJenkins says while he thinks the discussions were in good faith, ultimately the healthcare mandate still would require Notre Dame to forfeit its religious rights."}
