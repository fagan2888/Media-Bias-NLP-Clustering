Mike Rounds\u2019 day was jam-packed. Thursday, Jan. 29, less than a month into his first term, South Dakota\u2019s junior senator needed to be in the Dirksen Senate Office Building in the morning, where two important hearings were going on at once: the Banking Committee was considering legislation to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons, and in Armed Services, three former secretaries of state were testifying on national security. Right in the middle of the hearings, Rounds had to preside over the Senate floor for an hour, a job intended to familiarize freshmen with procedures.\n\n\u201cDifficult\u201d is how Rounds, a man used to setting his own agenda, describes time management in the Senate.\n\nSuch is life in one of the nation\u2019s most deliberative elected bodies, where hectic day-to-day schedules belie reality, which is that most things get done at a snail\u2019s pace here. It\u2019s a system this year\u2019s crop of 13 newcomers \u2013 12 Republicans and a lone Democrat \u2013 will have to get used to. But Rounds has one advantage over his colleagues: his eight years as governor of South Dakota.\n\nRounds was chief executive of the Mount Rushmore State from 2003 until 2010, enjoying high approval ratings and winning reelection easily in 2006 \u2013 a Rasmussen poll had him at 62 percent approval in October 2010, just before he left office, according to The Washington Post. Rounds then went back to the private sector, running an insurance and real estate agency before announcing a 2014 Senate run. He won in November with just over 50 percent of the vote.\n\nWith the addition of Rounds, there are now 10 former governors serving in the U.S. Senate: four Republicans, five Democrats and an independent. Rounds agrees with conventional wisdom that says governors, who run sprawling bureaucracies and manage their own agendas, suffer culture shock in the crawling pace of the Senate, surrounded by 99 other lawmakers with different ideas and goals.\n\nRounds said his experience as a governor will allow him to navigate the Senate, find issues with bipartisan agreement and get things done. But that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be an adjustment, and his first month in Washington has already produced some challenges.\n\n\u201cSome weeks have been very slow and you\u2019re wondering why we\u2019re not getting more done. Other weeks we\u2019re moving things through at a fairly rapid pace and we\u2019d like more of an opportunity to look at some of the amendments before you\u2019re actually voting on them, but that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll get used to,\u201d Rounds told RealClearPolitics in an interview outside the Senate chamber. \u201cThe flow will go from very slow to very fast, and we just have to be prepared to be nimble in the process.\u201d\n\nRounds comes along at an interesting time in Senate history, with Congress entrenched in seemingly endless partisan bickering throughout President Obama\u2019s administration. Republicans complained loudly and often for the past six years about the way then-Majority Leader Harry Reid ran the Senate, keeping a tight lid on the amendment process and avoiding votes on bills Democrats disagreed with. Democrats, on the other hand, accused the GOP of being obstructionists and \u201cthe party of no.\u201d\n\nNow, with the Senate back into Republican control, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has promised a return to regular order, debating bills and allowing amendments, and indeed, senators spent most of January on the Keystone XL pipeline, with dozens of amendment votes, including 18 in one day.\n\nSen. John Thune, the senior senator from South Dakota and third-ranking Republican in the Senate, called the past few weeks \u201cvery much a baptism by fire,\u201d saying that new senators were thrown into a legislative process that moved much more quickly than it had in years past. \"Talk about having to hit the ground running and figuring out right away how the legislative process works.\"\n\nYet Democrats wasted little time employing the same tactics they denounced Republicans for when they were in the majority. When the chamber moved from Keystone into funding for the Department of Homeland Security last week, Democrats filibustered the GOP leadership, voting three times in three days against debating a bill that would fund DHS while derailing Obama\u2019s executive action delaying deportations for millions of undocumented immigrants.\n\nRounds\u2019 experience with those two bills informed his observation that things often move either too quickly or too slowly in the Senate. The Keystone debate was positive because there was a free flow of ideas, but there wasn\u2019t always time to look into amendments carefully before voting on them, Rounds said. With DHS funding, Rounds said Republicans want to bring the bill up for debate, even if they don\u2019t necessarily agree with the House provision to reverse Obama\u2019s immigration order, but Democrats are blocking anything from moving forward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of getting to that point where each of the two parties has a certain position of strength,\u201d Rounds said, but at this point in the process, neither side trusts the other to compromise.\n\nThough he served as governor for two terms, Rounds isn\u2019t new to legislating. Before his gubernatorial run, he spent a decade in the South Dakota State Senate, including six years as majority leader. Rounds said the process so far in Washington is very similar to what he experienced legislating at the state level.\n\n\u201cI think he really knows the drill better than most who come here who haven\u2019t had that dual background,\u201d said Sen. John Hoeven, the former governor of North Dakota. \u201cAs a governor you can really set your agenda much more, whereas it\u2019s much harder to do that in the Congress or in the Senate. But I think in Mike\u2019s case he really comes well prepared because he\u2019s had experience doing both.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, ex-governors in the Senate started the Former Governors Caucus to network and meet across party lines. Sen. Angus King, an independent from Maine, said former governors may not always agree on policy, but they are resolutely fixated on getting results.\n\n\u201cAs governors, we often had to direct policy initiatives, work closely with state legislators \u2013 and at times, serve as a bridge to get things done,\u201d King said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, we understand the importance of compromise, of finding middle ground, and of responsible governing.\u201d\n\nRounds has met with the caucus once, and said members share similar concerns about the fiscal state of the country and the lack of a balanced budget. In one of his first acts in Washington, he co-sponsored legislation to create a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. He said there is less accountability on Capitol Hill than in a governor\u2019s office when it comes to reining in spending.\n\nIn South Dakota, Rounds said, if the government spends more than it takes in, there\u2019s a \u201cnuclear option\u201d that triggers a statewide property tax assessment. If that were to happen, he said, every politician would face a tough path to reelection.\n\n\u201cThere was a hammer built in by the founding fathers of our state that says you will maintain a reasonable budget and if not, you\u2019re going to catch holy hell,\u201d Rounds told RCP. \u201cAt the federal level, this is not the case. There is nothing within the Constitution that stops you from literally spending money but not taking the responsibility for raising the money that you intend to spend. It\u2019s easy to spend money if you don\u2019t have to look at the taxpayer and say this is how much money I\u2019m spending that is your money. And that\u2019s a terrible way to run a government.\u201d\n\nRounds is the only former governor in this year\u2019s class of newcomers to the Senate, while six of the freshmen served across the Capitol in the House of Representatives. Thune, a congressman for six years before running for Senate in 2004, said coming from the House has some advantages.\n\n\u201cThe Senate\u2019s a very different institution with very different timing and a very different pace and so you just have to adapt to that,\u201d Thune said. \u201cBut I would think coming in from the outside would be harder for sure, simply because House members have a little bit of a feel for how things work here.\u201d\n\nRounds agreed with Thune, saying that just knowing directions around Capitol Hill and knowing committee structures helps former House members hit the ground running. His background as a governor makes him always on the watch for inefficiency and ways to consolidate and problem solve, though he knows the importance of building coalitions for legislation, thanks to his time in the state senate.\n\nEven the simplest of things take time in the U.S. Senate, however, like getting permanent office space \u2013 which hasn\u2019t happened for Rounds yet \u2013 and meeting the rest of the senators. Thune said it can be hard for constituents to understand that.\n\n\u201cSometimes I think there\u2019s a real rush to get fully staffed and operational and I think patience, just taking it in stride, taking your time, is really good advice,\u201d Thune said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t try to shake it up a little bit when you get the chance. Believe me, I believe this place could be shaken up a little bit.\u201d\n\nFor Rounds, one of the best parts of the first month in Washington has been getting to know his fellow lawmakers. He hopes for bipartisanship on certain issues, including defense appropriations and sequestration, executive branch overreach and \u2013 he told RCP days before it passed with nine Democratic senators joining Republicans \u2013 the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nHe sees former governors as crucial to that bipartisan success.\n\n\u201cThere are good people on both sides of the aisle who really do want to find a path forward,\u201d Rounds said. \u201cIf we can kind of stick together as a group and continue to talk, we\u2019ll find areas of agreement that might surprise other members of Congress.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
