(left), waits in line before the Freedom Summit on Saturday in Greenville.\n\nGREENVILLE \u2014 Saturday marked South Carolina\u2019s biggest gathering of Republicans on the White House trail this year. And while Jeb Bush and Sen. Lindsey Graham didn\u2019t attend the Freedom Summit, those who did played right to the GOP base.\n\nOnline For more political coverage, information on the Palmetto Politics app or to sign up for our newsletter, go to palmetto politics.com.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I have 13 children \u2014 that\u2019s why we\u2019re conservatives,\u201d retired insurance executive Louis Neiger of Newberry said in describing why he planned to spend nine hours listening to a dozen hopefuls.\n\nQuotable Quotable from Saturday\u2019s Freedom Summit of conservatives in Greenville: In defense of \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said he defended \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d star Phil Robertson\u2019s views on gays and marriage because of the religious right of faith. Also, its one of the few shows left that his family can watch without having to worry \u201cabout language or images,\u201d he said. Jindal will decide by June on running for the White House. The blame for urban decay \u201cYou wind up with Detroit or Baltimore when you try to have policies that control everything.\u201d \u2014 former U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint, now of the Heritage Foundation, in addressing the differences between the parties. Harley Hog Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker recalled buying a Harley-Davidson T-shirt during his last visit to Greenville. He said he\u2019d like to do a bike tour of the state, if his staff will let him. Wisconsin is home to the motorcycle giant. Best mix of church and guns \u201cThe best defense against crime is an armed citizenry. Amen!\u201d \u2014 Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry told the applauding crowd. Loudest, longest applause \u201cI dont give a sh*t about lobbyists.\u201d \u2014 Donald Trump. Trump held nothing back, saying he had no problem with the Chinese. They pay him tens of millions of dollars to lease his properties in New York, he said, including in Trump Tower. Taking on homegrown terror \u201cThankfully, one police officer helped them meet their virgins.\u201d \u2014 Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on the shooting deaths of of two gunmen who tried to force their way into an anti-Prophet Muhammad event in Garland, Tex. Most nostalgic \u201cWhen I compare Jimmy Carter to Barack Obama, I actually miss Jimmy Carter.\u201d \u2014 Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa\n\nLittle news was broken during the marathon day, but that wasn\u2019t the point. The goal was to give the leading figures in the GOP race \u2014 including Scott Walker, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio \u2014 the opportunity to deliver their 15-minute canned stump speeches to a live audience. It meant mostly bad-mouthing President Obama, calling for greater tax relief in Washington, talking up their humble upbringings and standing up to the self-proclaimed Islamic State.\n\nSaturday\u2019s speakers\u2019 list also included Donald Trump, Rick Santorum, Rick Perry, John Bolton, George Pataki, Bobby Jindal, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina.\n\nBush, the former Florida governor, was giving the commencement speech at Liberty University in Virginia, though many conservatives at Saturday\u2019s event said he wasn\u2019t missed.\n\nGraham, who is expected to formally declare his own bid June 1, took the weekend off for a family commitment, his office said.\n\nKentucky U.S. Sen. Rand Paul did not attend either.\n\nGraham\u2019s absence wasn\u2019t considered a lost opportunity by some of the more than 2,000 Republicans here. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019m against him \u2014 I\u2019m just not for him,\u201d said Kayla Culbertson of Easley. She added, \u201cYou know I\u2019m not the only one.\u201d\n\nSome conservatives see Graham and Bush as too willing to compromise on immigration reform.\n\nFor the candidates who appeared, the reception was enthusiastic as most of the crowd at the Peace Center auditorium came from the Upstate, with many tea party and evangelical voters mixed in.\n\nFlorida Sen. Rubio\u2019s appearance was his first in South Carolina since formally announcing his White House campaign. His speech, though, was among the shorter of those given, lasting under 10 minutes.\n\nRubio couched the 2016 race in terms of moving the country forward while pointing to a Washington that\u2019s out-of-touch with a changing world and failing to make the needed course shift.\n\n\u201cWhy is this happening to the greatest nation on Earth?\u201d he asked. \u201cAt it\u2019s core the reason is this: Because the economy and the world all around us is undergoing historic and dramatic changes but we are led by too many people who are trapped in the past by ideas that no longer work.\u201d\n\nTexas Sen. Cruz was much lighter in his delivery. \u201cSo, is this the \u2018Ready for Hillary\u2019 rally?\u201d he joked to some boos.\n\nCruz quickly turned to his stump platform that includes abolishing the Internal Revenue Service and repealing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which he called a jobs killer.\n\nBoth Cruz and Rubio are officially in the race. So is Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO, and Carson, a retired neurosurgeon.\n\nCarson targeted what he described as the growing war on religious liberty, particularly censorship of the word \u201cGod\u201d even though it can be found in speeches, writings and simple matters of American faith.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s on our money, but we aren\u2019t supposed to talk about it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn medicine, we call that schizophrenia,\u201d he said to claps.\n\nFiorina was among the most vocal of the candidates in speaking against Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. \u201cUnlike Hillary Clinton, I\u2019m not afraid to answer questions about my track record,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump, the New York real estate mogul, spoke the longest and hinted that his campaign announcement is coming soon, probably in late June. He foreshadowed that he would play up his outside-of-Washington credentials by saying that supporting career politicians represents more of the same.\n\n\u201cSadly, politicians are all talk and not action,\u201d he said of his criticism of government. \u201cThey aren\u2019t going to get you to the Promised Land.\u201d\n\nWalker, the Wisconsin governor, played up his in-office credentials that includes tightening the state budget, taking on public unions and winning in a state that previously has leaned Democratic.\n\nHis record was enough to secure the support of Greenville voter Rod Christian.\n\n\u201cWhat he says here is meaningless,\u201d Christian said of the stump format. \u201cIt\u2019s what he\u2019s already done as governor\u201d in Wisconsin, that has solidified his vote.\n\nOne influential Republican who spoke Saturday told the crowd that their pick for the primary should be based on something more than who spends the most money or who collects the most big-name endorsements.\n\nFormer U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint, now of the Heritage Foundation, said conservatives should go with who is the most committed to conservative principles in 2016.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about giving a good speech, it\u2019s about good ideas,\u201d he said.\n\nThis was third installment of the Freedom Summit. Earlier versions took place in Iowa and New Hampshire. South Carolina\u2019s first-in-the-South primary is likely to be held Feb. 20, 2016, giving voters an 11-day window to evaluate the candidates after the New Hampshire primary.\n\nReach Schuyler Kropf at 937-5551.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Republicans gather in Greenville for biggest White House event so far, News, \r\nNewsPolitics, \r\nElections, \r\nFederal Politics, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Carly Fiorina,Election 2016,Greenville,Lindsey Graham,Marco Rubio,Republican,Rick Perry,Scott Walker", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "GREENVILLE \u2014 Saturday marked South Carolina\u2019s biggest gathering of Republicans on the White House trail this year.
