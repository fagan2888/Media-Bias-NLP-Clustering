A driver died after losing control of his vehicle and slamming into a light pole at the intersection of Santa Fe Drive and Mississippi Avenue early Sunday.

The driver was heading south on Santa Fe at a high rate of speed, when he lost control at 2:31 a.m., said Doug Schepman, Denver Police spokesman.

He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Alcohol or drugs may have been involved in the crash, Schepman said.
