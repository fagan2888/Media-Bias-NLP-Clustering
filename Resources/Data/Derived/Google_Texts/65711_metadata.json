But this year was different: My organization decided to set up a free yoga class twice a week for anyone to take in the conference room.\n\nBut what if, instead of the yoga class being free of cost or obligation, it was tied to my health insurance premiums through an employee wellness program and was only accessible if I answered a bunch of personal medical questions first? The second requirement alone would deter most of my privacy-minded colleagues here at the Center for Democracy & Technology. The first provokes more questions: What if I was too embarrassed to be in my yoga clothes with co-workers or had an injury that prevented me from joining in? What if I was afraid that disclosing medical information, like depression, would affect my performance reviews? Should I have to pay more than the yogis for my health care because I don't participate?\n\nWellness in general, whether cheered by health care providers, empowered through wearable devices like Fitbits or Jawbones or incentivized by employer programs, has emerged as one of the most talked about health policy issues this year. Provisions in the Affordable Care Act have allowed employers to use incentives of up to 30 percent of the total cost of an employee's coverage to increase enrollment and participation.\n\n\n\n[READ: How the Uber Model Could Transform U.S. Health Care]\n\nMany employers began using small incentives like gift cards to encourage more employees to join in, but the incentives have ballooned over time into premium reductions in the thousands of dollars and bonuses like free yearly gym memberships, prompting questions of how and when incentives morph into penalties and coercion. Some say employers have adopted wellness programs (even though their efficacy is in doubt) because they can shift costs onto employees who don't meet wellness program targets or who don't participate. And who are those conscientious objectors? Typically, they are poorer and less healthy than their counterparts at work.\n\nLast year, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces workplace discrimination laws like the American with Disabilities Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, took notice of these increasing employer incentives and began aggressively filing cases against companies that were allegedly penalizing employees for declining incentives, effectively coercing them into participation in so-called voluntary programs. The EEOC argued that such practices violate both the ADA and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act by forcing people to give up sensitive health information for non-business related reasons. Wellness or else seemed to be a trend on its way out.\n\nThe EEOC cases brought up an important question: How can a program can be considered voluntary when the stakes for non-participation include termination, health insurance or missing out on large reductions in premiums? Advocates cheered the commission's willingness to not only stand by its previous position on the issue, but also stir the pot on an issue so clearly loved by other governmental entities.\n\nBut the celebration was short-lived: On April 20, the EEOC issued proposed rules on how the ADA should be interpreted with regard to employer wellness programs. Suddenly, penalties were back in. Under the EEOC's proposal, employers are still permitted to impose penalties (and denials of rewards) of up to 30 percent of the combined employee-employer cost of health insurance on workers who don't answer questions or undergo exams.\n\n\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nThe EEOC's proposed rules are an attempt to reconcile what it sees as a tension between the ADA, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act and the health care law: namely, that it's not possible to have laws that protect personal health information while simultaneously encouraging robust participation in wellness programs that require data for tracking purposes. In other words, workplace wellness programs are allowed to violate nondiscrimination laws like the ADA as long as they comply with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe interpretation is baffling, to say the least. The EEOC's proposed change would allow employers to use financial penalties to force workers to disclose information to their employers, a position in direct opposition with its prior statements and current litigation. Protection against discrimination is not in conflict with the promotion of wellness \u2013 in fact, laws like the ADA provide a shelter for individuals who are vulnerable to the use of their health information in an adverse way, thereby increasing their ability to trust the system. Every provider knows that trust equals adoption when it comes to health care.\n\nThere is a disparate economic impact at play as well that would be exacerbated by the implementation of these rules. One sample situation: a worker who pays $200 a month in insurance and whose employer pays $800 a month could see her share of the premium more than double to $500/month (30 percent penalty on $1,000 amounts to $300, on top of her current $200 premium share) \u2013 an additional $3,600/year on top of what she currently pays, if she declines to answer disability-related questions. The question of whether to sign up looks very different when you are an executive versus an assistant.\n\n\n\n[READ: Bringing Back Asylums Will Not Help Mentally Ill People]\n\nMoreover, complying with the health care law shouldn't have an impact on ADA compliance. The Affordable Care Act doesn't address how wellness programs should behave when workers refuse to answer detailed medical questions nor should it \u2013 the ADA works well here. Because the two laws address separate issues, it's difficult to see how this would be a burden for companies in terms of compliance.\n\nBeyond the question of incentives and penalties, wellness programs have raised significant privacy concerns. Health data about employees is often gathered through health risk assessments that ask in-depth personal information such as pregnancy status, state of mental health and, in some instances, even more sensitive information such as whether someone is sexually active. Some go as far as using biometric screenings that measure body mass index or cholesterol. Others push the envelope even further. Companies like Aetna are piloting tests to determine which factors indicate metabolic syndrome, which would point to a higher risk of obesity, heart disease and diabetes.\n\n\n\n[READ: When Health Care Cost Studies Get the Facts Wrong]\n\nAs the data becomes increasingly specific and individualized, it becomes increasingly identifiable. Data flows in health are notoriously difficult to map and almost impossible for most people to follow. Despite assurances from companies that sensitive health data from wellness programs is kept confidential and secure, it's not a stretch to wonder exactly how the information might be used for personnel decisions or how it might be used or combined with other data (like grocery store purchases) when it ends up in the databases of third-party vendors.\n\nThe EEOC's proposal directs wellness programs to provide a notice to individuals with details about what data is collected, used and with whom it is shared. But it does not require that these programs have the same level of protection and individual rights offered under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, which includes key provisions like giving individuals access to their records, the ability to change or update information, a list of all disclosures of their data and the opportunity to have confidential communication of their information. These rights should apply to all entities in the wellness program ecosystem, from employers to insurance companies to vendors that administer the programs.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Policy Dose [Opinion]", "title": "EEOC's Proposed Rule on Employee Wellness Programs Threatens Health Privacy", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Penalties for opting out of workplace wellness programs unfairly burden poorer employees and raise privacy concerns.", "title": "Wellness or Else", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/policy-dose/2015/05/29/eeocs-proposed-rule-on-employee-wellness-programs-threatens-health-privacy", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/87/70/449d47dc4bd68426ea3a3192c630/150107-yoga-stock.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Penalties for opting out of workplace wellness programs unfairly burden poorer employees and raise privacy concerns.", "card": "summary", "title": "EEOC's Proposed Rule on Employee Wellness Programs Threatens Health Privacy"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "May 29, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Michelle De Mooy ,Affordable Care Act,health care reform,healthwellness [Consumer Advice],Policy Dose [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Penalties for opting out of workplace wellness programs unfairly burden poorer employees and raise privacy concerns."}, "article_summary": "Should I have to pay more than the yogis for my health care because I don't participate?\nBeyond the question of incentives and penalties, wellness programs have raised significant privacy concerns.\nThe EEOC's proposal directs wellness programs to provide a notice to individuals with details about what data is collected, used and with whom it is shared.\nEvery provider knows that trust equals adoption when it comes to health care.\nBut the celebration was short-lived: On April 20, the EEOC issued proposed rules on how the ADA should be interpreted with regard to employer wellness programs."}
