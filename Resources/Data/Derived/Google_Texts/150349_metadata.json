The information will help reconcile estimated versus actual income.\n\n\u201cIf you underestimated your income\u2014you made a little bit more during the year than what you told the government\u2014then you may have to repay some of your premium tax credit,\u201d Zumwalt said. \u201cIf you overestimated your income, then your refund will actually go up a little bit.\u201d\n\nThe information from the 1095A form must be transferred to Form 8962. Then Form 8962 must be filed with your tax return, Zumwalt says. If you don\u2019t file that form, then you may be disqualified from receiving assistance the following year, or even accessing the marketplace, he said.\n\nForm 1095B is proof of insurance from a broker, insurance company or a small employer. Form 1095C is proof from a large employer with more than 200 employees. Technically, you don\u2019t have to have 1095B or C to file your taxes.\n\n\u201cIf you had insurance all year, which most people do through their employer, then you simply mark on your tax return that you had full coverage and you move on,\u201d Zumwalt said. \u201cThe IRS will receive these forms and double-check that you and everyone listed on your tax return actually had insurance for the entire year.\u201d\n\nForm 1095A should already be out, but Form 1095C has been delayed, Zumwalt said. The IRS gave large employers an extension, so they have until March 31 to provide these forms for their employees.\n\nThere is one situation where you might need Form 1095C with your tax return.\n\n\u201cIf you had an offer of coverage but declined it, then you might need that form to show that your coverage was actually considered unaffordable,\u201d Zumwalt said.\n\nIf your income is below the filing threshold, which is $10,300 for an individual and $20,600 for a married couple filing jointly, then you are not required to have health insurance.\n\nIf your income is above the filing threshold, there is another possible exemption if you lived in a state that did not expand Medicaid.\n\n\u201cMissouri is a state that did not expand Medicaid, and so if your income is below 138 percent of poverty for the number of people in your household, then you also don\u2019t have to provide proof of health insurance,\u201d Zumwalt said. \u201cFor an individual, 138 percent of poverty is $16,105, with an additional $5,602 for each person in your household.\u201d\n\nOne difficulty associated with ACA marketplace insurance and the premium tax credit is estimating total income. Some taxpayers miscalculated their gross taxable income, which can include more than just your paycheck.\n\n\u201cIt can include your wages, unemployment, interest or dividends, retirement payments that aren\u2019t from a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k) or 403(b),\u201d Zumwalt said. \u201cSo, it\u2019s basically any income you received, whether it\u2019s earned or unearned.\u201d\n\nThere are sure to be questions this year as you file your 2015 taxes, but there\u2019s help available.\n\n\u201cThe Volunteer Income Tax Assistance services can help. Go to IRS.gov and search for the nearest VITA site,\u201d Zumwalt said. \u201cYou can get answers or actually have your tax return prepared.\u201d\n\nMore information is available from MU Extension\u2019s Health Insurance Education Initiative at extension.missouri.edu/insure.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Joomla! - Open Source Content Management", "author": "Staff Writer", "og": {"site_name": "Boone Country Connection", "title": "New health insurance forms for 2015 taxes", "url": "http://boonecountryconnection.com/news/community-interest/3658-new-health-insurance-forms-for-2015-taxes", "image": "http://boonecountryconnection.com/images/bcc_header_email.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "rights": "\u00a9 Boone Country Connection.
