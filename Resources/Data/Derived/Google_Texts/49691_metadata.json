The Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to reduce cost-sharing for people buying health care on exchanges based on their incomes, with the federal government reimbursing the insurers for the cost.\n\nThe suit was filed last November by the Republican-dominated House, which argued that the Obama administration had violated the Constitution by providing cost-sharing subsidies that Congress had never specifically approved. It seeks to stop the administration from distributing some $136 billion to the insurers over a decade.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe administration contends that it has the authority under the reform law to distribute the money without getting a specific annual appropriation, and that it is simply carrying out the law.\n\nBefore the suit could proceed, the House had to show that it had standing to sue. Many legal experts argued that the plaintiffs could not meet that requirement, since the House is only one chamber, not the entire Congress, and that courts are reluctant to intervene in political battles between branches of government.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJudge Rosemary Collyer of the United States District Court, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, however, ruled on Wednesday that the House could proceed despite those objections.\n\nShe said that the House was sufficiently affected to have standing to sue, even without the Senate joining in. And she said the lawsuit was the only way for the House to preserve its constitutional power to control federal spending. The White House said it would appeal the decision and expected the courts to dismiss it.\n\nThe judge said she was not ruling on the merits of the case, which she will determine in a later proceeding. In truth, this lawsuit seems to be an effort to get around a legislative defeat \u2014 basically a typical, garden-variety political dispute \u2014 that has no business being in the court system. If the Republicans want to end all cost-sharing subsidies, they could make that explicit by rewriting the health reform law.\n\nA few years ago Jack Balkin, a Yale Law School professor, described how \u201coff-the-wall\u201d legal arguments, which most mainstream lawyers think clearly violate legal precedents, have been taken up and legitimized by judges sympathetic to them. It would be a travesty if this lawsuit ends up creating the same havoc as other baseless challenges to the Affordable Care Act, which took up enormous resources and time, only to be struck down by the Supreme Court.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150911032105, "twitter": {"description": "Once again, Republicans are trying to manipulate the courts into overturning the health care law.", "title": "The House Stretches Legal Logic on Health Reform", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/opinion/the-house-stretches-legal-logic-on-health-reform.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003902051"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/11/opinion/11fri3web/11fri3web-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/opinion/the-house-stretches-legal-logic-on-health-reform.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003902051", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/opinion/the-house-stretches-legal-logic-on-health-reform.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "House Stretches Legal Logic on Health Reform", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 11, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Supreme Court (US)", "keywords": "Editorials,Health Insurance and Managed Care,United States,United States Politics and Government,House of Representatives,Suits and Litigation (Civil),Republican Party,Supreme Court (US),Courts and the Judiciary,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Congress", "news_keywords": "Editorial", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/11/opinion/11fri3web/11fri3web-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Once again, Republicans are trying to manipulate the courts into overturning the health care law.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/11/opinion/11fri3web/11fri3web-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Once again, Republicans are trying to manipulate the courts into overturning the health care law.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 11, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2015-09-24", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "published": "2015-09-11", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "United States", "slug": "11fri3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150924030005, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/opinion/the-house-stretches-legal-logic-on-health-reform.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/11/opinion/11fri3web/11fri3web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Once again, Republicans are trying to manipulate the courts into overturning the health care law.", "title": "The House Stretches Legal Logic on Health Reform"}, "pdate": 20150911, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010)", "articleid": 100000003902051, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "The House Stretches Legal Logic on Health Reform", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe43\"", "article_summary": "If the Republicans want to end all cost-sharing subsidies, they could make that explicit by rewriting the health reform law.\nOnce again congressional Republicans are trying to manipulate the courts into overturning health care reforms that they have been unable to block in the normal political process.\nThe Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to reduce cost-sharing for people buying health care on exchanges based on their incomes, with the federal government reimbursing the insurers for the cost.\nAnd she said the lawsuit was the only way for the House to preserve its constitutional power to control federal spending.\nShe said that the House was sufficiently affected to have standing to sue, even without the Senate joining in."}
