Board of Education.\n\nThe U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana approved a three-year plan for desegregation in its lawsuit against the Avoyelles Parish School Board. The desegregation case was filed as far back as 1967. In 2008, district officials planned to realign its schools. During the approval process, the U.S. District Judge in Alexandria said the superintendent and board members should hire an expert to get the district to fulfill certain requirements, such as desegregation of transportation, student assignment, teaching staffs and extracurricular activities.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nDesegregation in Louisiana\n\nThe consent decree calls the district \u201cunitary,\u201d which means the school is desegregated but an outside expert will have to monitor the district\u2019s progress for the next three years. In the entire 5,500 student-school district, slightly more students are white than black, but at individual schools, the racial breakdown varies widely, according to the Associated Press. At Bunkie Elementary Learning Academy, the student population is 82 percent black and at Larfargue Elementary School, the population is 80 percent white.\n\nThe increased focus on desegregation in Louisiana is due in part to the state\u2019s voucher program, which some critics say is making segregation worse by giving parents incentives to take their children out of public schools and put them in schools with children of similar racial makeup.\n\nGov. Bobby Jindal (R) introduced the voucher program, which would direct public funds toward private schools but a state court ruled the funding mechanism was unconstitutional, so he found funds elsewhere to continue the program.\n\nThe voucher program has been in court battles for some time now, with a federal judge ruling the state may be required to give more information on the details of the program in 2014, such as enrollment and racial breakdown, due to a 1975 court order and a 1985 consent decree in a desegregation case. Now a federal appeals court in New Orleans will hear arguments from pro-voucher groups on whether they need to provide reports on the program.\n\nSegregation in the United States\n\n\n\nBut segregation of schools isn\u2019t just a problem for Louisiana or the South in general, despite the focus on school segregation in the Southern U.S. over the years. A study from the University of California, Los Angeles, found that across the country, 43 percent of Latino students and 38 percent of black students go to schools where fewer than 10 percent of their classmates are white, and more than one in seven black and Latino students attend schools where less than 1 percent of their classmates are white. The report also noted that schools with high-minority populations usually have low-income populations, making the schools economically homogeneous as well.\n\n\u201cSome of the greatest fights against integration of schools were fought in the North, such as Boston, Denver, Detroit,\u201d said Howard Fuller, civil rights activist and education reform advocate and author of the book, \u201cNo Struggle, No Progress: A Warrior\u2019s Life from Black Power to Education Reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen people talked about school desegregation they almost always just talked about the South, without understanding the history of the battles for desegregation of the North,\u201d Fuller said.\n\nFuller protested the building of a segregated school in Cleveland in 1964. At the protest, Reverend Bruce W. Klunder was run over by a bulldozer when he tried to stop construction.\n\n\u201cWhat happened back then in Cleveland, they were busing black children out of the black community and once kids got there, they were forced to stay in their classroom even though they were quote \u2018fully integrated.\u2019 They wouldn\u2019t let the kids eat lunch with the other children,\u201d Fuller recalls of school desegregation at the time.\n\nThe report shows that although there is an increasing prevalence of segregated schools for black students in the Southern United States, Northern states such as Michigan, New York and Illinois tend to have the most segregated schools for black students. California, New York and Texas have the most segregated schools for Latino students.\n\nBlack and Latino students are also less likely to receive a quality education, since they are more likely to be taught by less qualified and experienced teachers, according to U.S. Department of Education data.\n\nBut recent U.S. Supreme Court cases haven\u2019t helped with the enforcement of desegregation. The court ruled 5-4 to not implement public school assignment plans which \u201ctake account of students\u2019 race\u201d in a 2007 case affecting students in Louisville, Kentucky and Seattle, which had implications for students in segregated schools across the country. The school districts choose to use individualized racial classifications to increase diversity through student assignment.\n\n\u201cWith the Department of Justice, there seems to be an uptick in pursuing segregation cases, which I think is good and important, but there are limits on what the department can do, given what the court has laid out in school integration,\u201d The Century Foundation\u2019s Kahlenberg. \u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court has, over time, made it easier and easier for school districts to get out from under school desegregation orders.\u201d\n\nEconomic and political factors\n\nThe resegregation of schools has also been affected by school districts redrawing their boundaries in ways that further divide communities by race and economic status. Students living in areas that have declining populations and low property value are unable to benefit from the revenue that had once been shared in a larger district that included more affluent communities, for example. There is a growing movement of towns voting to secede from school districts, in order to have \u201clocal control\u201d and increase \u201cacademic excellence,\u201d according to The Nation.\n\nHousing discrimination and generational poverty also help to keep schools segregated. Without acknowledging many of the economic factors, it\u2019s difficult to integrate schools effectively, experts say.\n\nFor example, affordable housing is often placed in neighborhoods that have been traditionally black or Hispanic, banks can charge higher loan rates in black and Hispanic communities and landlords may only accept applications from residents with certain credit scores. Landlords may offer white residents certain privileges while putting off repairs to apartments belonging to people of color. Sometimes residents face blatant racism, such as this poster specifically instructing black residents to be quiet.\n\nThe Obama administration finalized a Department of Housing and Urban Development regulation in 2013 that was supposed to make it easier to file allegations of housing discrimination by using \u201cdisparate impact,\u201d as one way to show evidence of discrimination, but in November of last year a D.C. District Court judge threw out the rule.\n\n\u201cIn some of these cities, there are not enough white people to even have a discuss about integration,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cSo if we think we can do school desegregation in the absence of dealing with economic policies, in the absence of dealing with housing policies, if you don\u2019t attack those policies and just sit here and think you can talk about school desegregation, that\u2019s ludicrous.\u201d\n\nOne often ignored issue is not simply integration of a school district but attention to integration within classes, since some classes may be majority people of color while others are majority white. A Duke University paper, \u201cRace, School Integration and Friendship in America,\u201d notes that even when a school is declared integrated, the experience of students is anything but. At a certain age, children stop forming cross-racial friendships and socialize along racial lines. One of the ways to avoid purely superficial integration would be to ensure classrooms are racially mixed as well as extracurricular activities, but schools may be held back from making those changes due to the aforementioned 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision.\n\nWhat is the best way to desegregate schools?\n\nRichard Kahlenburg, senior fellow at The Century Foundation, said that research broadly shows the importance of integration in improving the student outcomes over simply increasing funding for districts with mostly impoverished students.\n\n\u201cThe message coming out of Washington has been we don\u2019t need to worry about integration because we can provide opportunities for students through highly segregated charter schools and that\u2019s been very discouraging to proponents of integration who realize that on the ground its very difficult to make high poverty districts work,\u201d Kahlenberg said.\n\nFuller said that while he understands the research clearly illustrates the importance of integration, he wants to focus on what he can do to raise standards for students now to prepare them for the global marketplace, regardless of whether those schools are integrated.\n\n\u201cThe question is is racial integration the biggest thing or is class the biggest thing to focus on? I get what people are saying about the research on what integration does and the impact it has on these children\u2019s lives,\u201d Fuller said. \u201cBut if I spent the next 10 years talking about integration, it would have no impact on these children\u2019s lives, because given all the other things that impact these children\u2019s lives, given all these policies and the environment they live in, I don\u2019t see integration as a feasible struggle to take on.\u201d\n\nKahlenberg said he has seen examples of schools with majority students of color succeed, but that they tended to also be economically mixed.\n\n\u201cThe key here is not to create white and wealthy enclaves of privilege within the public school system but to ensure a racial and economic mix in those schools,\u201d Kahlenberg said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the racial mix per se that drives the student achievements, it\u2019s the socioeconomic mix, so I\u2019m not saying majority minority schools can\u2019t be successful but that all students are do better when there\u2019s an economic mix than when there is a high concentration of poverty.\u201d\n\nThis article was originally published by Think Progress, a project of the Center for American Progress Action Fund \u00a9 2005-2015.", "article_metadata": {"description": "School Segregation Is Much Bigger Than A Few Schools In The South", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Casey Quinlan | ThinkProgress", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "School Segregation Is Much Bigger Than A Few Schools In The South", "title": "School Segregation Is Much Bigger Than A Few Schools In The South", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/school-segregation-is-much-bigger-than-a-few-schools-in-the-south/206306/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Marshall-Brown-e1387820338359.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-05T06:51:49-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "School Segregation Is Much Bigger Than A Few Schools In The South", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Marshall-Brown-e1387820338359.jpg", "title": "School Segregation Is Much Bigger Than A Few Schools In The South", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "segregation", "published_time": "2015-06-06T05:00:05-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-05T06:51:49-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Segregation in the United StatesBut segregation of schools isn\u2019t just a problem for Louisiana or the South in general, despite the focus on school segregation in the Southern U.S. over the years.\nThe report shows that although there is an increasing prevalence of segregated schools for black students in the Southern United States, Northern states such as Michigan, New York and Illinois tend to have the most segregated schools for black students.\n\u201cThe question is is racial integration the biggest thing or is class the biggest thing to focus on?\nA Duke University paper, \u201cRace, School Integration and Friendship in America,\u201d notes that even when a school is declared integrated, the experience of students is anything but.\nThe report also noted that schools with high-minority populations usually have low-income populations, making the schools economically homogeneous as well."}
