This summer, the Bluegrass Poll showed Democrat Jack Conway with a slight lead over Bevin.\n\nRGA spokesman Jon Thompson would not comment on why the group stopped airing ads. But he said \u201cwe are constantly evaluating what role the RGA has in all of our governor\u2019s races.\u201d\n\nThompson said it was \u201cvery possible\u201d the group could resume airing the ads before voters cast ballots in November.\n\nThe RGA produced several TV ads over the summer deriding Conway and supporting Bevin.\n\nKentucky Democratic Party spokesman David Bergstein was quick to respond to news that the RGA had pulled out of Kentucky, saying Republicans don\u2019t trust Bevin.\n\n\u201cThroughout his campaign, Bevin has displayed a level of pathological dishonesty that borders on delusional,\u201d Bergstein said.\n\nBevin\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThroughout the campaign season, Democrats have highlighted several instances where Bevin has contradicted himself on a wide range of issues.\n\nDuring a Republican primary debate on KET, Bevin said the federal early childhood education program Head Start \u201cserves no purpose.\u201d Since then, he has said he supports early childhood education initiatives. Bevin also said he would \u201creverse\u201d the state\u2019s Medicaid expansion \u201cimmediately\u201d before saying he would scale it back; the program, which was expanded via the Affordable Care Act, now covers an additional hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians.\n\nThe RGA raised $24.4 million in the first six months of 2015 and had more than $20 million in cash on hand as of June 30.\n\nDewey Clayton, a political science professor at the University of Louisville, said the timing of the RGA\u2019s actions did not bode well for Bevin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting to crunch time, and any news like this is clearly not good news,\u201d Clayton said. \u201cWhen outside groups start pulling funding from one source or another, it also gives the perception that they may feel those funds may be better used elsewhere.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The political action committee's move came two days before the release of a much-anticipated Bluegrass Poll.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "The political action committee's move came two days before the release of a much-anticipated Bluegrass Poll.", "title": "Republican Governors Association Stops Airing Bevin Ads", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1920, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BevinMcConnell2-e1438481184697.jpg", "height": 652}, "updated_time": "2015-09-29T16:39:05-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/republican-governors-association-stops-airing-bevin-ads/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The political action committee's move came two days before the release of a much-anticipated Bluegrass Poll.", "creator": "@RylandKY", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BevinMcConnell2-e1438481184697.jpg", "title": "Republican Governors Association Stops Airing Bevin Ads", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Politics", "tag": "2015 election", "published_time": "2015-09-29T07:03:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-29T16:39:05-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "RGA spokesman Jon Thompson would not comment on why the group stopped airing ads.\n\u201cThroughout his campaign, Bevin has displayed a level of pathological dishonesty that borders on delusional,\u201d Bergstein said.\nThe Republican Governors Association\u2019s decision to stop airing ads for Kentucky gubernatorial candidate Matt Bevin may fuel perceptions that his campaign is struggling about a month before Election Day, a political observer says.\nThe RGA produced several TV ads over the summer deriding Conway and supporting Bevin.\nThroughout the campaign season, Democrats have highlighted several instances where Bevin has contradicted himself on a wide range of issues."}
