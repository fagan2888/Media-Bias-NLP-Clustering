Wellness Visits Aren\u2019t Always Free Wellness and prevention are major cornerstones of the Affordable Care Act as a way to reduce long-term care costs. The president\u2019s signature legislation requires all insurance plans to offer consumers access to wellness visits and health screenings free of charge. But there\u2019s a limit. Whether it\u2019s a colonoscopy, mammogram or wellness visit for a child, there are always rules associated with it, says Zamosky. For example, some plans have age limits for services like a colonoscopy or mammogram to be free. Some plans also limit the number of wellness visits a year, and confusion of what constitutes a wellness abounds. According to insurance experts, if a person goes to a wellness appointment with a list of complaints about ailments the appointment could be no longer be preventive, but diagnostic, and the patient will be charged accordingly.\n\n2. Beware of Specific Limits, Costs and Deductibles High-deductible plans, which means you have to cover any minor or routine health care costs until your deductible is met, are becoming more common. But it\u2019s not just up-front and out-of-pocket costs you have to pay on these plans. Insured people can be charged for co-insurance and co-pays, all of which may differ depending on the type of doctor you are seeing. For instance, some plans charge higher co-pays when you see a specialist compared to your regular doctor. Other plans may require a referral before you can see a specialist. \u201cYou have to be aware of the specific limits,\u201d says Carrie Mclean, director of customer care at eHealthInsurance. \u201cIt\u2019s important to know everything from the co-pay to the co-insurance. Plans can work differently.\" You should also know when you need preauthorization for a service in order to have your plan kick in. \u201cIf you have to have surgery, most insurance companies require you to submit paperwork to demonstrate this medically necessary,\u201d says Zamosky. \u201cYou have to find out what those rules are.\u201d It\u2019s also a good idea to bring a list of prescription medicines your insurance covers when you go to the doctors to make sure you aren\u2019t prescribed something you can\u2019t afford.\n\n3. Know Your Doctors For many people, particularly ones with chronic diseases, they see the same doctors and specialists all the time and are loyal to their care givers. But that loyalty can end up costing a lot of money if one of the doctors fall out of their network. While it seems like a no brainer, it\u2019s common for people to purchase insurance without first checking to see if their current doctor accepts that plan. It\u2019s not enough to ask a doctor if he or she takes a particular type of insurance, ask about a specific plan. \u201cPeople really get caught off guard\u201d with this, says Mclean. \u201cKnow who your network provider is because if you go out of network, you can get sticker shock.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-08
