There's a light at the end of the tunnel -- and it's a subway train, finally pulling into Manhattan's newest station.

Almost two years after its initial promised opening date, a subway stop at 34th street and 11th Avenue that extends the route of the No. 7 train is ready for business. Officials are expected for a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Sunday and train service scheduled to start in the early afternoon.

The station on Manhattan's far west side extends the No. 7 train 11/2 miles past its current last stop in Times Square. It's the first station added to the system in more than 25 years.

It brings a transit option to a part of the city undergoing a construction boom and home to the popular High Line park.
