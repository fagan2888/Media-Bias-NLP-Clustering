Reuters\n\nIn the aftermath of the financial crisis, U.S. regulators imposed new requirements on credit-card companies and mortgage lenders, mandating that they evaluate whether borrowers have the financial resources to pay back their loans. Now, the focus is on high-cost, short-term \u201cpayday\u201d loans.\n\nThe principle\u2014that lenders should avoid making loans to borrowers who can\u2019t afford them\u2014may sound simple. But translating such a concept into rules lenders can follow is much more difficult in practice, particularly for low-income borrowers who take out payday loans. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is facing such a task as it works on the first set of national rules for the $46 billion payday-lending industry.\n\nThe consumer-finance regulator, as we write today, is developing an \u201cability to repay\u201d requirement for companies offering payday loans, which are typically made for less than $500. Companies would be allowed to make such loans only to borrowers who can pay them back . In addition, the CFPB is weighing whether to create a category of \u201cvanilla\u201d short-term loans\u2014a set of requirements that lenders can follow to ensure they are satisfying the CFPB\u2019s \u201cability to repay\u201d requirement.\n\nBut how should such a standard be drawn? The CFPB is barred by law from putting a cap on borrowers\u2019 interest rates, the main way states regulate payday lenders.\n\nThe Pew Charitable Trusts, which has put out several studies on the payday-loan market, says the CFPB should limit borrowers\u2019 payments to 5% of their monthly income, arguing that loans above that percentage should be barred unless borrowers can demonstrate they can meet their financial obligations.\n\nConsumer-advocacy groups, however, want the CFPB\u2019s standards to be even tighter, incorporating borrowers\u2019 expenses and other debts.\n\nCritics say payday lenders don\u2019t always consider borrowers\u2019 ability to pay back their loans and instead profit by hitting borrowers with high fees and repeated \u201crollover\u201d loans.\n\n\u201cThe typical small-dollar lender\u2019s business model depends on having some of its borrowers getting caught in a debt trap of repeated rollovers,\u201d says Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown University. \u201cAny lending model that depends on some borrowers not being able to repay is a real problem.\u201d\n\nIndustry groups, meanwhile, say the CFPB is likely to cut off credit to borrowers in need of emergency financial help, and they question whether the regulator can provide a legal justification for its intention to regulate the industry.\n\nAnd analysts say the CFPB\u2019s regulations are likely to force major changes in the industry. Rules by the CFPB will \u201cforce payday lenders to adjust how they do business and it may shrink the size of the payday lending market,\u201d wrote Guggenheim Securities analyst Jaret Seiberg. \u201cThis will generally favor the largest players, which are best suited to bear the costs of these changes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The CFPB is looking to restrict these loans to borrowers who have the resources to repay them.", "title": "Can High-Cost Payday Loans Be Made \u2018Affordable\u2019 For Borrowers?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/totalreturn/2015/01/05/can-high-cost-payday-loans-be-made-affordable-for-borrowers/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GG818_0105cf_P_20150105152809.jpg"}, "site": "WSJpersfinance", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "article.headline": "Can High-Cost Payday Loans Be Made \u2018Affordable\u2019 For Borrowers?", "description": "The CFPB is looking to restrict these loans to borrowers who have the resources to repay them.", "article_section": "Personal Finance", "author": "Alan Zibel", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Total Return Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Total Return", "article.summary": "The CFPB is looking to restrict these loans to borrowers who have the resources to repay them.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-01-05T20:41:17-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-142", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/totalreturn/2015/01/05/can-high-cost-payday-loans-be-made-affordable-for-borrowers/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-TOTALB-2679", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Personal Finance", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The CFPB is looking to restrict these loans to borrowers who have the resources to repay them.", "title": "Can High-Cost Payday Loans Be Made \u2018Affordable\u2019 For Borrowers?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/totalreturn/2015/01/05/can-high-cost-payday-loans-be-made-affordable-for-borrowers/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GG818_0105cf_P_20150105152809.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Total Return", "article.id": "BL-TOTALB-2679", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-01-05T20:41:46-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb080\"", "article_summary": "Critics say payday lenders don\u2019t always consider borrowers\u2019 ability to pay back their loans and instead profit by hitting borrowers with high fees and repeated \u201crollover\u201d loans.\nNow, the focus is on high-cost, short-term \u201cpayday\u201d loans.\nBut translating such a concept into rules lenders can follow is much more difficult in practice, particularly for low-income borrowers who take out payday loans.\nThe CFPB is barred by law from putting a cap on borrowers\u2019 interest rates, the main way states regulate payday lenders.\nThe consumer-finance regulator, as we write today, is developing an \u201cability to repay\u201d requirement for companies offering payday loans, which are typically made for less than $500."}
