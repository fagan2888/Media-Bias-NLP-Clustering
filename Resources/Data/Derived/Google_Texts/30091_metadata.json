Some residents have no choice but to buy groceries from an old ice-cream truck. Others rely on men known as \u201criders\u201d who transport shoppers for a few bucks.\n\nOccasional gunshots ring out even as the days of out-of-state drivers lining the streets to buy drugs are largely over. Young children are everywhere except during school hours, when many are scattered far from home at 150 schools around the nation\u2019s capital because of a long history of subpar education in the neighborhood.\n\nThis is the Kenilworth-Parkside neighborhood, where residents such as Taryn Tymus, a mother of four who sells homemade jewelry, have heard lots of promises about a better life to come. The promise of a new recreation center after theirs was torn down. The promise of owning their public housing units. Promises of better schools.\n\nPromises all unfulfilled.\n\nThen, the DC Promise Neighborhood Initiative put down a stake with a new promise: to tackle generational poverty with a fresh approach.\n\nBacked by a multiyear, $28 million Education Department Promised Neighborhood grant and support from people such as former Secretary of State Colin Powell and his wife, Alma, the initiative tries to offer services to two generations \u2013 parents and children. It stems from research that shows that as a parent\u2019s level of education improves, so does a child\u2019s prospects.\n\nModeled after the Harlem Children\u2019s Zone in New York, \u201cpromised neighborhoods\u201d are being planned or underway in at least 20 states.\n\nIn the Kenilworth-Parkside neighborhood, helping the children get a good education is a primary focus, but it\u2019s the adults who must be engaged first. Many are skeptical.\n\n\u2014\n\nTymus, 38, is proud to call this predominantly African-American neighborhood home. But she doesn\u2019t hesitate to point out the downsides: the six-lane highway families must cross to get to a subway station; the high-priced Kenilworth Market, robbed so many times that cinderblocks now cover the backdoor; teenagers having babies; the violence.\n\nTymus says she warns young men to stay out of trouble. \u201cIt hurt, when they really go down like that,\u201d says Tymus, who greets neighbors by name as she strolls Quarles Street not far from where one of her boyfriends was found dead in a church lot a decade ago, 22 bullets in him.\n\nHere, single mothers run nearly 90 percent of the households with children. The dads are mostly missing.\n\nThe isolationism only makes things harder. The neighborhood not far from the Capitol is bordered by I-295, the Anacostia River and an aging power plant.\n\nThings haven\u2019t always felt so bleak.\n\nWithin Kenilworth-Parkside is Eastland Gardens, where residents since the 1950s have maintained a flower club. In addition to hundreds of public housing units, brick single-family homes line the streets, some of them designed and built by black architects and builders.\n\n\u201cWe were poor but we didn\u2019t know we were poor because we always had something to eat and some place to stay,\u201d says Claudette Brown, one of eight siblings who were among the first residents of Kenilworth Courts when it opened in 1959. It was one of the city\u2019s first integrated public housing complexes. Now a grandmother, she still calls Kenilworth home.\n\nBrown recalls the strife, too. After King\u2019s assassination, mobs threw rocks at her school bus on her way home because the driver was white. \u201cPeople were acting real crazy,\u201d she says.\n\nViolence and drugs in later years rocked the neighborhood, sending residents to prison and leaving others dead. In the 1980s and 1990s, the neighborhood\u2019s problems attracted the interest of Jack Kemp, the New York congressman and later U.S. housing secretary.\n\nWorking with resident Kimi Gray, he helped orchestrate a federal effort to turn public housing in Kenilworth over to residents to manage and eventually own. The personal ownership plans never fully materialized and while residents still manage a section of the housing, the District of Columbia Housing Authority had to step in and bail it out.\n\nKenya McKeever, 44, a mother of four, says one day she stepped outside to dump the garbage and two dead bodies were in a car. \u201cIt affected me in a way that I never want to see that again,\u201d McKeever says.\n\nTwo different fathers of longtime resident Latissa Tate\u2019s 10 children died violent deaths. One of the men was standing in a store buying cigarettes in 2006 when he was killed in a drive-by shooting, she says.\n\nShe says her children are coping, but she worries about them every time they walk out the door. \u201cI pray,\u201d Tate says. \u201cI believe in the Lord and I put it in his hand. We get through it day by day.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, residents were hopeful when the neighborhood recreation center was razed, with plans by the Interior Department to rebuild it. But plans were stalled because environmental contaminants were found on site, where children still play, stemming from a former dump that decades earlier had billowed black smoke.\n\nThen, three years later came news that upset many residents. Kenilworth Elementary was to close.\n\n\u2014\n\nChildren wept at a meeting when the school closing was announced, Tate says. At that time, there were 147 students in the 55,000 square foot building. Only about one-quarter of the students were performing at grade level in reading and math, but there was a strong sense of community tied to the school.\n\nMeanwhile, the promised neighborhood initiative was moving forward. It was the brainchild of Irasema Salcido, the charismatic founder of the Cesar Chavez Public Charter School, which opened a middle- and high school campus in the neighborhood in 2005.\n\nSalcido says \u201cparents were hugging me and crying\u201d when she said she would get their children ready for college. What she quickly discovered was that the students coming to her were well behind. She met with two area elementary school principals and heard something similar: preschoolers and kindergarteners lagged from Day One.\n\nAt a ladies\u2019 coffee, Salcido was introduced to Alma Powell, head of the board of directors for America\u2019s Promise Alliance. The two shared a common dream of creating something similar to the Harlem Children\u2019s Zone in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to get all of this started,\u201d Mrs. Powell says. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole another thing to keep it going.\u201d\n\nThe initiative set up shop in the abandoned Kenilworth school building and converted former classrooms into computer labs and children\u2019s play areas. The old gym became a boxing training area with a ring. Computer training for adults was started and a parent resource center opened at Neval Thomas Elementary School, another neighborhood school. After-school programming was rolled out, providing youngsters and teenagers with homework help, hip-hop dancing, boxing and digital media learning.\n\nWorkers such as Sharita Slayton, a resident hired to be the community liaison, were spotted at church socials and housing association meetings shaking hands and handing out fliers. \u201cWe have a second chance to get it right,\u201d Slayton told anyone who would listen.\n\nOfficials early on helped relocate 100 of the former Kenilworth school kids to Neval Thomas. That meant many could report every morning to their old school where they are loaded on a bus and taken a mile away.\n\nMcKeever and other parents were leery. Who were these people? What was their motivation? \u201cA lot of people come, but they don\u2019t stay,\u201d McKeever says.\n\n\u2014\n\nAlready, the after-school program has won over some parents, and their children.\n\nPhillip Crooms Jr., 13, is performing in a production of \u201cThe Wiz\u201d put on by the after-school kids. He says the program \u201ckeeps my mind off the negative stuff.\u201d\n\nHis mother, Sonya Jones, said Phillip has been picked on at multiple schools, at one point getting a concussion after being hit in the head. Now, she takes the subway with him as he commutes to Eliot-Hine Middle School because she worries about him getting in a fight.\n\nShe\u2019s considered the Cesar Chavez charter school on the other end of the neighborhood, but \u201canything can happen\u201d with that long a walk.\n\n\u201cI would love to live in a different neighborhood, I really would, where I know he\u2019s getting an education and I don\u2019t have to worry about anything happening to him there,\u201d Jones said. She said she recently lost her job because of issues related to taking care of him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a single parent,\u201d Jones says. \u201cOf course my son comes first.\u201d\n\nAlso at the after-school center, boxing coach Umar Abdus-Salaam keeps a watchful eye on three of the Tate brothers, whose father died.\n\nAbdus-Salaam takes all the boys he coaches not just to boxing matches but on fishing trips and to sporting events. The city bus driver said very few of the boys he works with have biological fathers around and some have mothers addicted to drugs. Some don\u2019t get enough calories to gain the pounds needed to move up in weight classes as they should, he said.\n\n\u201cThese kids need love,\u201d Abdus-Salaam says. \u201cThey need to know that they are cared about \u2026 We show them tough love and exposure amongst other things.\u201d\n\nAbdus-Salaam says he preaches to the boys about the value of being a good citizen and staying out of a prison cell. \u201cWe have a goal of trying to live an adult life without entering the penal system,\u201d Abdus-Salaam says.\n\nTate says the coach has been a father figure to her sons. \u201cBeing a mom, there are certain things I can\u2019t do that a man can do, so he helps me,\u201d Tate says.\n\nMrs. Powell said she was delighted when teenagers in one of the programs put together digital media campaigns on preventing teenage pregnancy. In one, a large teenage boy dressed like a baby to illustrate how difficult parenthood is.\n\n\u201cMany of them don\u2019t know how to be fathers because they didn\u2019t have one,\u201d she says. \u201cThey think it\u2019s normal to walk away.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nInitiative leaders know it takes much more than after-school programs to transform a neighborhood.\n\nAll \u201cpromised neighborhoods\u201d must carefully track data about the communities they serve but also the success or failures of what they\u2019re doing. The model requires partnerships with many organizations so multiple needs can be addressed at once.\n\nIn Kenilworth-Parkside, the initiative has about 25 partners such as Educare, a high-quality school for young, at-risk kids connected to Warren Buffett that opened a center in the neighborhood. Another is the city\u2019s Housing Authority, which is attempting to overhaul the Kenilworth Courts housing project. But a request for a $30 million federal housing grant to complement the initiative\u2019s work was turned down, dashing hopes at least in the short term for new retail space that might have attracted a grocery.\n\nWorkers from the initiative are on site at Neval Thomas and Cesar Chavez schools, and grant dollars have helped provide computer tablets, after-hours programs at Cesar Chavez, a math coach and more.\n\nBut with programming just rolling out in the last year, it\u2019s too early to judge what\u2019s working. The initiative will receive federal grant dollars until 2017.\n\nOne of the top programs has yet to start: essentially assigning a personal assistant to about 40 of the neighborhood\u2019s neediest families. This person will advise them in all aspects of their lives, such as how to enter school lotteries, enroll in a GED credential program or find a pediatrician.\n\n\u201cI wish we had made a bigger difference faster but I understand it\u2019s not realistic,\u201d said Wendy Goldberg, leader of the initiative\u2019s board.\n\nNot all residents are convinced that the initiative will be effective. Some are frustrated with the pace. Tymus, who worked briefly for the initiative, recruited teenagers for a program on teenage pregnancy only to find it canceled. Still, she says she appreciates the voice it is giving residents.\n\nDarlene Smith, a property manager in Kenilworth, said she still sees plenty of teenagers hanging out in the neighborhood with nothing to do.\n\n\u201cRelationship-building is slow work,\u201d says Nicole Newman, the initiative\u2019s community organizer.\n\nBut McKeever, the mother of four who now works with the after school programming, says after seeing the level of teenage involvement, especially among the boys, she\u2019s more hopeful. Things feel less desperate in the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cI see the promise and the hope of the kids,\u201d McKeever says. \u201cYeah, we have a lot of stuff going on but I see a lot of the changes.\u201d\n\nAndre Dubard, 45, whose son boxes in the afternoon program, said something\u2019s long been missing in the neighborhood with so many fathers away. But he also believes change can happen \u201cif we can catch the kids when they are small, young kids, and teach them the right way to do things.\u201d\n\nSalcido says one of her students told her that parents cannot see beyond the poverty and public assistance that have marked lives here for so many generations.\n\nThe children, this student said, can.\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Kimberly Hefling on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Modeled after the Harlem Children's Zone in New York, \"promised neighborhoods\" are being planned or underway in at least 20 states.", "pubdate": 20140524, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Modeled after the Harlem Children's Zone in New York, \"promised neighborhoods\" are being planned or underway in at least 20 states.", "title": "DC community tries new anti-poverty program", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/182693192.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/dc-community-tries-new-approach-tackle-poverty/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "Modeled after the Harlem Children's Zone in New York, \"promised neighborhoods\" are being planned or underway in at least 20 states.", "creator": "@newshour", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/182693192.jpg", "title": "DC community tries new anti-poverty program", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "poverty"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "D.C., poverty"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb806\"", "article_summary": "Then, the DC Promise Neighborhood Initiative put down a stake with a new promise: to tackle generational poverty with a fresh approach.\nComputer training for adults was started and a parent resource center opened at Neval Thomas Elementary School, another neighborhood school.\nOfficials early on helped relocate 100 of the former Kenilworth school kids to Neval Thomas.\nIn addition to hundreds of public housing units, brick single-family homes line the streets, some of them designed and built by black architects and builders.\nIt was one of the city\u2019s first integrated public housing complexes."}
