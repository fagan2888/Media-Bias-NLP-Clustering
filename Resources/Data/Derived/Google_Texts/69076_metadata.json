Predictably, people have chosen sides, which is symptomatic of the politics of public education. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, unless you believe that one size should fit all.\n\nThe views of voucher opponents underscore the conflict of visions and irreconcilable differences between the two sides. One critic invoked the mid-19th century egalitarian ideology of Horace Mann as the model for public education, \u201cinstilling common values and culture to all children,\u201d as Mann put it. That\u2019s a disqualifying premise to conservative education reformers to whom Mann is not an education oracle.\n\nHe was a disciple of Robert Owen, a utopian Welshman known as the father of modern socialism. In 1825, Owen created a commune in Indiana, renamed New Harmony, marked by \u201ca community of common property,\u201d in which individualism and private enterprise were regarded as destructive. Students in the common school would be indoctrinated accordingly.\n\nBy 1827, New Harmony failed and was disbanded, being incompatible with the human nature of the adults. Owenites, like Mann, concluded that indoctrination of the young must start earlier and be universal as a stepping stone to socialism. His \u201cachievement\u201d as secretary of the Board of Education in Massachusetts was the creation of a centralized, state-controlled public school bureaucracy.\n\nScolding Dougco voucher supporters, one letter-writer declared, \u201cIf the conservatives of Dougco are dissatisfied with current public education, they should work with the rest of us to fix the problems.\u201d But there\u2019s no collective \u201cus\u201d that comes close to a consensus on public education policy. You can\u2019t \u201cfix the problems\u201d if you fundamentally disagree on what they are. To Dougco critics, common values are their own liberal values, exploiting public schools as laboratories for social engineering, replete with seniority-based collective compensation and little accountability for unionized teachers.\n\nThere is a consensus that public education should be publicly funded. Vouchers do that, allowing dollars earmarked for educating children to follow them to the school of their parents\u2019 choice \u2014 public or private. But public funding doesn\u2019t require delivery in a monopoly of government schools. Defending that monopoly and opposing vouchers in their own self-interest are the government employees of the teachers unions. Highways are publicly funded, but the construction work is done privately. Medicaid is publicly funded, but doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies are still mostly private.\n\nVouchers offer academic diversity in public education. Different parents want different approaches and philosophies in educating their kids. The \u201crich\u201d can already afford that. Vouchers make that opportunity possible for lower- and middle-income parents, too. The Dougco school board has the confidence to make choice available as an alternative to its public schools.\n\nA majority of conservative voters in Dougco elected a school board that shares their vision on public education, just as liberals in Boulder routinely elect school boards that reflect their vision. That\u2019s as it should be. Dougco conservatives have no need or duty \u201cto work with\u201d their detractors in other school districts dominated by liberals married to the status quo and the teachers unions that dominate. They and their agenda reside somewhere else.\n\nIn Colorado, statewide standards and testing coexist with local control in public education. But local control through elected school boards is a bedrock principle. Increasing federal government encroachment is troubling. There\u2019s nothing the bureaucratic geniuses and politicians in Washington or the national educratic establishment have to offer about curricula or pedagogy that we can\u2019t do better right here. And we certainly needn\u2019t defer to their progressive agenda. That\u2019s why there\u2019s so much pushback on No Child Left Behind and Common Core. Many of the same people who champion those things oppose vouchers.\n\nFreelance columnist Mike Rosen\u2019s radio show airs weekdays from 1 to 3 p.m. on 850-KOA.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rosen: Dougco and the virtues of vouchers", "title": "Rosen: Dougco and the virtues of vouchers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/07/rosen-dougco-and-the-virtues-of-vouchers/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150807__20150809_Z00_OP09C_ROSENp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150807__20150809_Z00_OP09C_ROSENp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-07T13:42:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T05:20:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Dougco school board has the confidence to make choice available as an alternative to its public schools.\nPredictably, people have chosen sides, which is symptomatic of the politics of public education.\nIn Colorado, statewide standards and testing coexist with local control in public education.\nHis \u201cachievement\u201d as secretary of the Board of Education in Massachusetts was the creation of a centralized, state-controlled public school bureaucracy.\nStudents in the common school would be indoctrinated accordingly."}
