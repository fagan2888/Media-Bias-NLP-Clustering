It was making them less competitive.\u201d\n\nThe city had lowered the parkland fee in 2009 from more than $2,800 per unit to about $1,900, but commissioners in 2012 approved a moratorium on both charges to spur rental development as projects that all but died in the recession were being revived across the Tampa Bay area.\n\nDowntown St. Petersburg has a half-dozen apartment projects in the works, and Dunedin recently gave final approval to a large mixed-use complex on the north edge of its Main Street district.\n\nSince Largo\u2019s moratorium went into effect in May 2012, six developments either have resumed construction or submitted plans to the city.\n\nThe dilemma for builders was that the city\u2019s impact fees are levied at about the time permits are issued. The original moratorium would expire in 2014, before many projects could take advantage of it.\n\n\u201cThe moratorium is really just now starting to take effect,\u201d said Teresa Brydon, the city\u2019s economic development manager.\n\nSecuring financing also was proving difficult as planning and construction of large projects can take years, she said.\n\n\u201cIt was still difficult to put financial packages together and to do due diligence on these larger tracts of land that had been identified for apartment complexes,\u201d she said.\n\nCommissioners unanimously approved an extension of the moratorium on first reading at their meeting last week.\n\nA public hearing and second reading are scheduled for Nov. 19, and commissioners plan to hold a work session next year to review the fees.\n\nCity staffers are looking at permanently lowering the fees.\n\nAs of September, the city had $1.5 million in its parkland dedication fund and about $667,000 in its capital facilities fund, which are used for buying public lands. The last purchase funded by the parkland fee was a plot on Fifth Avenue Southwest in 2009 for about $86,000.\n\nMayor Pat Gerard said keeping the waiver in place for several more years is key to keeping the city competitive with area communities.\n\n\u201cThe moratorium will provide an incentive to developers to expand our housing inventory and provide new residential units that will strengthen and improve our neighborhoods,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\nEverett, the developer, said rental apartment construction had been stagnant for several years, slowed first by a preference to convert rentals to condos before the housing bubble burst and then by the economic crash.\n\n\u201cWhen the economy went down the tubes, we stopped almost all development. For four or five years you had almost no apartments being built,\u201d said Everett, whose company is also building the upscale NoHo Flats in Tampa\u2019s Hyde Park.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s kind of a pent-up demand for new apartments, and I think we\u2019re seeing that across the whole bay area,\u201d he said.\n\nGateway North will offer one-, two- and three-bedroom \u201cluxury market rate\u201d units ranging from about $700 to $1,400 per month.\n\nThe 153-unit Pinellas Heights off Ulmerton Road will offer affordable residences for seniors when it opens next year.\n\nJeff Rogo, government affairs director at the Bay Area Apartment Association, says he hopes a waiver in fees in cities such as Largo will encourage more affordable housing options for the working class.", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sun, 10 Nov 2013 21:06:07 -0400", "Description": "LARGO \u2014 A strong rental apartment market and the city\u2019s suspension of some development fees appear to be driving one of the biggest waves of residential development this community has s", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "LARGO \u2014 A strong rental apartment market and the city\u2019s suspension of some development fees appear to be driving one of the biggest waves of residential development this community has s", "title": "Largo waives fees, see apartment boom", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/pinellas-county/largo-waives-fees-see-apartment-boom-20131110/", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/staticimage/images/new_og_icon.png", "height": 200}, "updated_time": "2013-11-10T21:06:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Largo waives fees, see apartment boom"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-11-10T21:06:07Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-11-10T21:06:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf187\"", "article_summary": "LARGO \u2014 A strong rental apartment market and the city\u2019s suspension of some development fees appear to be driving one of the biggest waves of residential development this community has seen in decades.\nJeff Rogo, government affairs director at the Bay Area Apartment Association, says he hopes a waiver in fees in cities such as Largo will encourage more affordable housing options for the working class.\nThe appetite for more housing in this community of about 77,000 has moved city commissioners to extend a moratorium on two development fees from 2014 into 2016 to keep the momentum.\nDowntown St. Petersburg has a half-dozen apartment projects in the works, and Dunedin recently gave final approval to a large mixed-use complex on the north edge of its Main Street district.\nThe dilemma for builders was that the city\u2019s impact fees are levied at about the time permits are issued."}
