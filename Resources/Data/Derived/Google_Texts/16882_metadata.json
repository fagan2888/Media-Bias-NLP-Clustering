But where does the smell come from, exactly?\n\nIt seemed to appear that only some people could notice a strong odor from their urine after eating a lot of asparagus. Certain types of foods contain some odorous compounds that aren\u2019t able to be broken down by the body, and therefore must be expelled through excrement. In the case of asparagus, the vegetable contains asparagusic acid, a chemical that\u2019s not found anywhere else \u2014 at least not that we know of. When asparagusic acid is digested, it produces compounds like methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide, as well as dimethyl sulfone. Sulfur is known to contribute to skunk and rotten egg smells with their putrid odor.\n\nScientists hypothesized that some people were \"excreters\" while others were \u201cnon-excreters,\u201d if they were unable to smell the odor in their urine. At the same time, others theorized that some were \u201csmellers\u201d and others were \u201cnon-smellers,\u201d unable to detect the scent of methanethiol or dimethyl sulfide. Ultimately, after a slew of studies spanning several decades, scientists concluded that people could be both excreters and non-excreters, as well as smellers and non-smellers.\n\nHere's the detailed reason your pee smells weird after eating asparagus.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "asparagus, urine, why asparagus makes your pee smell", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Scientists wondered why only certain people notice a strange odor emanating from their urine after eating asparagus, and found that it likely has something to do with genetics.", "title": "Why Asparagus Makes Your Pee Smell So Weird [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/asparagus-makes-pee-smell-weird-asparagusic-acid-which-isnt-found-anywhere-else-312498", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/29/asparagus.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scientists wondered why only certain people notice a strange odor emanating from their urine after eating asparagus, and found that it likely has something to do with genetics.", "title": "Why Asparagus Makes Your Pee Smell So Weird [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/asparagus-makes-pee-smell-weird-asparagusic-acid-which-isnt-found-anywhere-else-312498", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/29/asparagus.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/29/asparagus.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Weird Medicine", "published_time": "2014-11-29T22:39:17-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-30T12:21:48-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Scientists wondered why only certain people notice a strange odor emanating from their urine after eating asparagus, and found that it likely has something to do with genetics."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8cbe\"", "article_summary": "When asparagusic acid is digested, it produces compounds like methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide, as well as dimethyl sulfone.\nIn the case of asparagus, the vegetable contains asparagusic acid, a chemical that\u2019s not found anywhere else \u2014 at least not that we know of.\nFilled with crucial nutrients like Vitamin K, asparagus is quite healthy for you, but it can also cause an odorous urine.\nHere's the detailed reason your pee smells weird after eating asparagus.\nScientists hypothesized that some people were \"excreters\" while others were \u201cnon-excreters,\u201d if they were unable to smell the odor in their urine."}
