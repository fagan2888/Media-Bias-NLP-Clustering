Mark R. Warner.\n\nRepublican operatives insist they have the right candidate and that the margin will close in the coming months in an environment favorable for the GOP, but outside groups have shown scant interest in backing Mr. Gillespie, who is being outspent, is still largely unknown by voters and has yet to really dent the popular Mr. Warner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the tortoise. Three yards and a cloud of dust,\u201d Mr. Gillespie said, chuckling. \u201cI know where this race is in my gut. I know how vulnerable Senator Warner has become. And his record \u2014 I know that my policies resonate with the voters, and I just feel like the next 10 weeks or so are going to be very, very good.\u201d\n\nElection analysts agree there should be an opportunity for a Republican to make the race competitive.\n\nQuentin Kidd, a political science professor at Christopher Newport University, said polling early this year indicated a slight disconnect between Mr. Warner\u2019s 63 percent approval rating and the percentage of voters who said he actually deserved re-election.\n\n\u201cBut when you put Warner and Gillespie head-to-head, [Warner] had a 20-point lead,\u201d Mr. Kidd said. \u201cI think his liability right now is that Warner is really liked and Gillespie is unknown.\u201d\n\nMr. Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman and senior adviser to President George W. Bush, is doing what he can to raise his visibility to the broader electorate. He has been crisscrossing the state in what his campaign dubbed the \u201cEase the Squeeze\u201d tour and held a rally last week with Sen. John McCain of Arizona in Norfolk in hopes of boosting his standing with the state\u2019s sizable military population.\n\nElsewhere in the country, Republicans are turning sleeper races into hot contests \u2014 notably in Iowa, Michigan and New Hampshire. Even incumbent senators in deep-blue states are feeling heat. Recent polling has found leads have shrunk to single digits for Sen. Al Franken, Minnesota Democrat, and Sen. Richard J. Durbin, Illinois Democrat.\n\nIn Virginia, though, the latest polling averages show Mr. Warner still maintains close to a 20-point lead over Mr. Gillespie. Libertarian candidate Robert Sarvis is also running.\n\nWith so many other options on the table, conservative groups have been unwilling to spend on Mr. Gillespie\u2019s behalf, leaving him to fight on his own.\n\nAt the end of July, Mr. Gillespie had $3 million cash on hand compared to Mr. Warner\u2019s $9 million.\n\nOutside spending is around $1.2 million, the bulk of which is actually anti-Gillespie buys from a super PAC supporting Mr. Warner. By comparison, groups have spent about $18 million already just to the south in North Carolina, where incumbent Sen. Kay R. Hagan is fending off a strong challenge from Republican Thom Tillis.\n\nMr. Warner, meanwhile, has tried to play up his efforts reaching across the aisle during more than five years in the Senate, with his campaign going as far as saying bipartisanship is part of his DNA.\n\n\u201cWhether bringing jobs back from overseas, helping borrowers pay down student debt or reducing our nation\u2019s debt and deficit, Senator Warner has been able to find common ground and real solutions,\u201d said spokesman David Turner.\n\nParty operatives, though, hope the race tightens as the fall stretch run kicks into gear and Mr. Gillespie tries to tie Mr. Warner\u2019s Senate record to an increasingly unpopular President Obama.\n\n\u201cThere is no way the way President Obama\u2019s numbers are it\u2019s a 20-point race, but the Warner campaign is doing a good job making sure nobody is paying attention to this race,\u201d GOP strategist Ford O\u2019Connell said.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Warner has built up reservoirs of goodwill across the commonwealth dating back to his 2001 gubernatorial run and even his first bid for Senate in 1996.\n\nBut he\u2019s also a freshman senator in a much more polarized atmosphere than existed during his time as governor, when he managed to cajole moderate Republicans in the state legislature into supporting much of his agenda.\n\nIn their first debate, Mr. Gillespie quipped that Governor Warner wouldn\u2019t recognize Senator Warner today.\n\n\u201cWhen you stand for re-election, voters are going to weigh whether or not the record you\u2019ve racked up warrants re-election,\u201d said Mr. Gillespie, who, for example, has highlighted Mr. Warner\u2019s vote for Obamacare. \u201cIt\u2019s the last thing he wants to talk about.\u201d\n\nBut Dave \u201cMudcat\u201d Saunders, a strategist who helped Mr. Warner make inroads into rural parts of the state during his 2001 gubernatorial run, said the Democrat has done a decent job of insulating himself from the president. Most recently, he\u2019s been touring college campuses talking about the relatable issue of student loan debt and has called on Mr. Obama\u2019s administration to present a clear plan to Congress to deal with the threat of the Islamic State terrorist group.\n\n\u201cHe was painted with a positive brush, and it dried well before anybody had heard of Obama,\u201d Mr. Saunders said. \u201cB.O. \u2014 he\u2019s \u2018before Obama.\u2019 \u201c", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans have closed gaps in Senate races across the country, but Virginia \u2014 a swing state where the GOP should be more competitive \u2014 has proved to be the exception, with longtime party operative Ed Gillespie failing to make headway against freshman Sen.
