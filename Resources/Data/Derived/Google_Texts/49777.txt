Candidate has right combination of experience, commitment to community.

I recently had the chance to become reacquainted with Roger Roth, state Senate candidate, at the farmers market in Appleton, and I came away impressed. The 19th Senate District hasn’t had new representation in decades and Roger is just what the Fox Valley needs to move forward.

I doubt that I’m alone in thinking that there needs to be a change in the Senate. Roger has a unique combination of assets that’s needed in Wisconsin. He has the perfect blend of youthful energy and civic-mindedness mixed with an old soul, ready to make difficult decisions and represent the Fox Valley.

While talking to Roger, I asked him to tell me a little more about his background and experiences. He began with him being a lifelong native of the Fox Valley, born in Menasha, attending St. Mary school and getting his college degree from the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh. From there, he talked about his experience in the Air National Guard and his multiple deployments to the Middle East during the Iraq War and how serving alongside people from all walks of life and all corners of our country helped shape his views on collaboration and leadership.

Finally, he noted his and his brother’s small business — building and remodeling homes across northeast Wisconsin. His love and pride for his family was evident when he was discussing his business with his brother and when telling me about the most recent addition to his life, his young son.

Father, small businessman, veteran — Roger Roth is the type of candidate that can relate and listen to all people in the 19th Senate District and then, most importantly, lead on those ideas and concerns when in office.

That’s why I plan to support Roger Roth on Nov. 4 and hope you do, too.
