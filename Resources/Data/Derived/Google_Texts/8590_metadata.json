One candidate threatened to shoot those who tried to come into his home. Other candidates have brought guns to rallies, raffled them off to supporters or challenged their opponents to debates of accuracy at the shooting range.\n\nIn races where the candidates would rather talk about the character deficits of their opponents -- a routine that usually involves accusing the other of knowing national politicians or having lived too long in the city that both are expending so much energy and money to end up in -- voters are sometimes left with ownership of a gun, a snowmobile or a pick-up truck as the only thing they definitively know about a candidate by the time November comes along. Which is to say, nothing at all.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) signals to supporters at the Fancy Farm picnic Aug. 2, 2014 in Fancy Farm, Ky. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nFor 2014, all of the gun ads and gun-waving is coming mostly from challengers, underdogs and open primary candidates. These are the people voters know the least about -- and who feel that much more urgency to play up their regular-guy/gal bona fides.\n\nThe gun ad isn't for challengers alone, though. The muse of the genre is Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who shot the cap-and-trade bill in a 2010 campaign ad.\n\nThe more important thing that binds all these candidates is the fact that they're all fighting during the midterms, where the likely electorate trends conservative, and both parties feel their time is better spent imploring their base to be interested enough to vote instead of worrying about converting independents or new voters.\n\nMost of the close races this year also take place in states where presidential picks tend to go red. Add millions of dollars of outside spending to the demographics and general midterm muck, and it's easy to see why campaigns often land on guns as the cheapest way to give their ads a little feng shui.\n\nIt's a \"touchstone issue,\" says Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky, \"a way to evaluate politicians\" and infer their other political beliefs if you haven't been paying much attention. And during a midterm, it's safe to assume that most voters haven't been watching the races closely.\n\nThis week's batch of gun ads stripped the genre to its essence. The first, from U.S. Senate candidate from Kentucky, Alison Lundergan Grimes (D), featured her shooting guns and telling Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) that he holds a gun the wrong way. The message: I'm Kentucky, you're not. (Also: I'm not Obama, which in a way is the underlying message of all gun ads.)\n\nDemocratic Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes hits Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and distances herself from President Obama in an ad released less than two months before the general election. (YouTube/Alison for Kentucky)\n\nMcConnell's campaign quickly responded with an ad that tried to refute Grimes's points one by one, ending on a Just Like Obama! In driving home that point, the ad compares photos of both Grimes and Obama ... holding guns.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) responds to an ad by his opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes. (McConnell campaign via YouTube)\n\nThe two ads are now airing at the same time; \"shooting it out,\" Cross noted, laughing. Cross also noted, still laughing, that another debate was brewing in Kentucky about whether Grimes was shooting skeet \u2014 as her ad's title declares \u2014 or whether she was shooting trap.\n\nThe one thing these ads all shy away from, though, is talking explicitly about guns and gun policy. Guns are used to make statements about Obamacare, outside money or civil liberties. The candidates know that the 2014 midterms aren't about guns, but they would like you to know that they own one.\n\nAt the same time, outside groups interested explicitly in gun policy are buying up ad time.\n\nThe National Rifle Association announced this week that its fall ad campaign is beginning; Politico reports that the NRA plans to spend more than $11 million. The first ads are airing in Arkansas, Colorado and North Carolina. The ads all feature the same diverse cast of gun owners, who smile as the narrator talks about Obama's \"extreme gun-control agenda,\" and the merits of the candidate the NRA has chosen to support.\n\nA few days from now, more ads are scheduled to appear in Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky and Louisiana. In 2012, the NRA's spending did little to help its chosen candidates. Out of the nearly $11 million spent by the NRA's Political Victory Fund in the general election, 0.83 percent went to a winning candidate, according to analysis from the Sunlight Foundation. The NRA's Institute for Legislative Action spent more than $7 million, about 11 percent of which went toward the end it had hoped for.\n\nThe last election wasn't a friendly year for the NRA, and they are bound to have more success \u2014 even if only by association \u2014 in some of the races they have chosen this year. And they will certainly have plenty of company when it comes to guns.\n\nAmericans for Responsible Solutions, the group founded by Mark Kelly and Gabrielle Giffords, also hopes that voters will cast ballots with an eye toward gun policy in these races, some where guns have already proliferated. They plan to runs ads for Democratic Senate candidates in Iowa, North Carolina, Louisiana, Colorado, Minnesota and New Hampshire. They are also supporting Republican Sen. Susan Collins in Maine, as well as a mix of Democrats and Republicans in House races. The PAC's first ads ran in Arizona's 2nd District congressional election (Giffords's old district). This week, they debuted ads in two New Hampshire House races.\n\nOne Senate candidate notably missing from the ARS lineup is Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), who did not back the Senate's failed background check bill, and was the target of ads from another anti-gun violence super PAC, Mayors Against Illegal Guns. Pryor retorted with an ad in May 2013 that said he didn't support \"President Obama's gun control legislation\" and was committed to protecting Arkansans' 2nd Amendment rights.\n\nAmericans for Responsible Solutions is also trying to reach the same gun owners as all these other gun ads. The organization is run by gun owners, and it's main argument falls along the lines of, we don't want to take your guns, we just want to keep them out of the hands of the wrong people. Expanding background checks is their policy goal. There are \"thornier issues\" when it comes to gun policy, like banning hardware, but \"we're working with the basics,\" ARS PAC senior adviser Pia Carusone said. Support for background checks has always been high; a Quinnipiac University poll from June has 92 percent of Americans supporting universal background checks.\n\nCarusone brings up Manchin, patron saint of the modern gun ad, as someone they see as a model, too. In 2013, Manchin co-sponsored the Senate's background check with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey (Pa.). If we're going to get change on this issue, \"we need mainstream Democrats and Republicans. The extremes of either party are never going to agree on this,\" Carusone said, who hates when ARS gets called a \"gun-control PAC.\"\n\nCarusone also said that they're \"not under the illusion that people are going to rush to the polls to vote on this issue.\" There's a reason that outside groups are the only ones explicitly tackling gun policy \u2014 everyone else is talking about the economy, foreign policy or health care. However, ARS sees support for background checks as a touchstone issue. Carusone sees not supporting universal background checks as a signpost for extremism.\n\nBut the truth remains that while ads with guns have proliferated, the only gun legislation that has made it through Congress in the past few decades has lifted restrictions on firearm usage. The flavor of gun support that politicians have inherited imparts an \"us vs. them mentality\" where it often seems like Americans for Responsible Solutions and some of the gun ads from the candidates it supports can't co-exist.\n\n\"And as we say down here,\" Cross said, \"there is no education in the second kick of a mule.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "A look at the many, many gun ads of 2014.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jaime.l.fuller", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A look at the many, many gun ads of 2014.", "title": "Guns are 2014\u2019s hottest campaign accessory", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/09/18/guns-are-2014s-hottest-campaign-accessory/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2013/05/gunshow51356735250.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@j_fuller"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/09/18/guns-are-2014s-hottest-campaign-accessory/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "campaign 2014, congress, nra, campaign ads", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jaime.l.fuller"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "campaign 2014, congress, nra, campaign ads"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe26ac\"", "article_summary": "Americans for Responsible Solutions is also trying to reach the same gun owners as all these other gun ads.\nCarusone brings up Manchin, patron saint of the modern gun ad, as someone they see as a model, too.\n(Also: I'm not Obama, which in a way is the underlying message of all gun ads.)\nThe one thing these ads all shy away from, though, is talking explicitly about guns and gun policy.\nThere's a reason that outside groups are the only ones explicitly tackling gun policy \u2014 everyone else is talking about the economy, foreign policy or health care."}
