Of particular concern is the senator\u2019s signature legislative action \u2014 the now-infamous Gang of Eight attempt at \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform.\u201d\n\nOn cue, National Review\u2019s Jim Geraghty rode out against the currents of conservative skepticism over Rubio last week to deliver a message: the White House hopeful is \u201cplenty conservative.\u201d\n\nListing a whole range of issues \u2014 from abortion to gun rights \u2014 Geraghty finds Rubio resides firmly with the conservative movement on pretty much all of them. Additionally, the senator has very high ratings from the American Conservative Union, the National Rifle Association and a number of other powerful organizations on the Right.\n\nThe National Review reporter makes quite the argument for why Rubio\u2019s conservative credentials are impeccable, and he even asserts that \u201cif Rubio really represents the new GOP \u2018establishment,\u2019 then the fight is over and the conservatives won.\u201d\n\nA bold thing to say, but if it\u2019s really the case conservatives have taken over the Republican establishment, then why is there so much seething anger within the grassroots?\n\nAnd, more to Geraghty\u2019s argument, why are these same outraged voters not going hogwild for the penultimate conservative politician Marco Rubio?\n\nThe answer to that question all goes back to Mr. Conservative\u2019s signature piece of legislation.\n\nNow Geraghty doesn\u2019t fail to mention Rubio\u2019s major role in the Gang of Eight, but the writer portrays it as a minor blemish to the Floridian\u2019s otherwise un-impeachable record. Most of the article\u2019s ink is spent trying to prove the young senator was primarily concerned with securing the border first rather than handing out citizenship.\n\nBut there\u2019s a few problems with this characterization of Rubio\u2019s role in the Gang of Eight. For one, and most importantly, it fails to mention it was the senator\u2019s defining action in his five years in the Senate. Marco\u2019s signature legislation isn\u2019t defunding Planned Parenthood or slashing Obamacare \u2014 it\u2019s a (failed) attempt to legalize millions of illegal aliens.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s more than a minor blemish that can be offset by less consequential votes in line with conservative dogma. It even presents an awkward situation for those on the Right who champion Rubio. If you\u2019ve spent several years ridiculing the current occupant of the White House for being a lightweight, then how does it look when you then back a man with similar levels of experience and has backed away from his most notable achievement in the Senate?\n\nIt\u2019s also a bit of whitewashing to claim Rubio was a border hawk when the immigration bill he backed was anything but a security measure. Byron York of the Washington Examiner has done invaluable work recently digging up the dirty details of the Gang of Eight.\n\nIn a November article, York wrote an exhaustive takedown of all what resided in the 2013 comprehensive immigration package. It would\u2019ve promoted more immigration, offered instant legalization of illegals and empowered federal bureaucrats to oversee the process. And when it came to security, the bill\u2019s guarantees weren\u2019t particularly solid.\n\nA commission touted by Rubio for ensuring security measures were enacted would only be able to offer tepid recommendations. A disturbing number of illegal alien criminals would be able to win passes for their crimes. And the back taxes \u201crequirement\u201d for legalized illegals wasn\u2019t that much of a set-in-stone requirement.\n\nFurthermore, in a December piece, York pointed out all the border security amendments supported by Ted Cruz and other Republican senators that Rubio voted against. One of those amendments not liked by Rubio would\u2019ve required 350 miles of fencing to be completed at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nMaybe you can still discount Rubio\u2019s 2013 actions as an error or as simply one black mark on a near-perfect conservative checklist. You can continue to shake your head at those angry talk show hosts and online commenters who deride the senator as a squish when you believe he\u2019s rock-solid conservative.\n\nBut you\u2019d be missing the point.\n\nRubio\u2019s support for mass immigration and amnesty is a key part of his political philosophy and the other good things about him don\u2019t change that. Right now, immigration is the fundamental issue of the Republican primary and has galvanized the base. To downplay it is to stick your head in the sand and hope Rubio\u2019s opposition to the Export-Import bank wins over the pitchfork crowd.\n\nWhether Rubio checks off the list of typical conservative positions doesn\u2019t really matter to the growing number of voters who are gravitating toward Cruz and Donald Trump. The Republican Party is dealing with a populist-nationalist fever which doesn\u2019t seem to care much with adhering to conservative orthodoxy.\n\nFor instance, the mass volumes of \u201cTrump is a fake conservative\u201d attacks published by National Review and numerous other right-leaning outlets haven\u2019t made any kind of impression on the GOP masses.\n\nAnd to this right-wing insurgency, immigration is the core issue for which to assess candidates and determine whether they live up to snuff.\n\nClearly, Rubio does not look well when viewed from the perspective of a populist-nationalist and that\u2019s the reason why talk radio, Breitbart and others have soured on him.\n\nPerhaps Rubio being the candidate of the conservative establishment is his main problem. They\u2019re losing touch with the base and he\u2019s having trouble connecting to voters with a message that\u2019s music to the ears of the Beltway Right.\n\nThe Onion once satirized Rubio\u2019s birthplace as a \u201cclosed-door conservative think tank strategy session in 2010.\u201d The perfect candidate\u2019s problem may lie in the fact his agenda was conceived in that same strategy session.\n\nFollow Scott on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Scott Greer", "description": "The Florida senator's signature legislation is much more than a minor blemish", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "[crscore]Marco Rubio[/crscore], the young junior senator from Florida, is now the establishment candidate of choice for 2016.
