Phamaly Theatre Company is hardly a stranger to national attention. Celebrating its 25th year, the Aurora-based theater company composed of performers with disabilities has received back-to-back grants from the National Endowment for the Arts to aid in its summer musical productions. Last year, a $10,000 grant enabled them to cast a guest violinist in “Fiddler on the Roof.” This year, the company obtained $20,000 for “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.” (At the Space Theatre, July 10-Aug. 10)

Now, Phamaly is expanding its profile internationally. In 2015, the troupe will put on its first production abroad when it takes the musical “The Fantasticks” to Osaka, Japan, the company announced Wednesday. The 10-day opportunity came at the invitation of the International Communication Center for Persons with Disabilities.The Osaka facility, built precisely to foster this type of cultural exchange, has a performance hall that can seat 1500.

“We are beyond thrilled for this incredible opportunity,” said Phamaly Executive Director Chris Silberman in a statement.

“For Phamaly and our performers, being immersed in another culture and teaching and performing in that culture will be a life-long lasting experience that will enrich our perspectives on disability and the performing arts that we will bring back to Colorado, and it will build the self-confidence, artistic skills, and life skills of the performers involved.”
