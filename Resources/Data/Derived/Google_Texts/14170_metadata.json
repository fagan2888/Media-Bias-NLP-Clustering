Nothing these folks were saying jibed with the basic facts of the Affordable Care Act as I understand them. I understand them fairly well; I have worked as a senior adviser to a governor and helped him deal with the new federal rules.\n\nI decided to hit the pavement. I tracked down Hannity\u2019s guests, one by one, and did my own telephone interviews with them.\n\nFirst I spoke with Paul Cox of Leicester, N.C. He and his wife Michelle had lamented to Hannity that because of Obamacare, they can\u2019t grow their construction business and they have kept their employees below a certain number of hours, so that they are part-timers.\n\nObamacare has no effect on businesses with 49 employees or less. But in our brief conversation on the phone, Paul revealed that he has only four employees. Why the cutback on his workforce? \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI haven\u2019t been forced to do so, it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve chosen to do so. I have to deal with increased costs.\u201d What costs? And how, I asked him, is any of it due to Obamacare? There was a long pause, after which he said he\u2019d call me back. He never did.\n\nThere is only one Obamacare requirement that applies to a company of this size: workers must be notified of the existence of the \u201chealthcare.gov\u201d website, the insurance exchange. That\u2019s all.\n\nNext I called Allison Denijs. She\u2019d told Hannity that she pays over $13,000 a year in premiums. Like the other guests, she said she had recently gotten a letter from Blue Cross saying that her policy was being terminated and a new, ACA-compliant policy would take its place. She says this shows that Obama lied when he promised Americans that we could keep our existing policies.\n\nAllison\u2019s husband left his job a few years ago, one with benefits at a big company, to start his own business. Since then they\u2019ve been buying insurance on the open market, and are now paying around $1,100 a month for a policy with a $2,500 deductible per family member, with hefty annual premium hikes. One of their two children is not covered under the policy. She has a preexisting condition that would require purchasing additional coverage for $600 a month, which would bring the family\u2019s grand total to around $20,000 a year.\n\nI asked Allison if she\u2019d shopped on the exchange, to see what a plan might cost under the new law. She said she hadn\u2019t done so because she\u2019d heard the website was not working. Would she try it out when it\u2019s up and running? Perhaps, she said. She told me she has long opposed Obamacare, and that the president should have focused on tort reform as a solution to bringing down the price of healthcare.\n\nI tried an experiment and shopped on the exchange for Allison and Kurt. Assuming they don\u2019t smoke and have a household income too high to be eligible for subsidies, I found that they would be able to get a plan for around $7,600, which would include coverage for their uninsured daughter. This would be about a 60 percent reduction from what they would have to pay on the pre-Obamacare market.", "article_metadata": {"description": "UPDATE I re-reported a Fox News segment on Obamacare -- it was appallingly easy to see how it misleads the audience", "title": "Inside the Fox News lie machine: I fact-checked Sean Hannity on Obamacare", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "UPDATE I re-reported a Fox News segment on Obamacare -- it was appallingly easy to see how it misleads the audience", "title": "Inside the Fox News lie machine: I fact-checked Sean Hannity on Obamacare", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/10/18/inside_the_fox_news_lie_machine_i_fact_checked_sean_hannity_on_obamacare/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/hannity_screens-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "UPDATE I re-reported a Fox News segment on Obamacare -- it was appallingly easy to see how it misleads the audience", "title": "Inside the Fox News lie machine: I fact-checked Sean Hannity on Obamacare", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/10/hannity_screens-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Eric Stern", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Conservatism, Editor's Picks, Fox News, Hannity, Health, Health Care, Media, Media Criticism, Obamacare, Sean Hannity", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Conservatism, Editor's Picks, Fox News, Hannity, Health, Health Care, Media, Media Criticism, Obamacare, Sean Hannity, News, Politics NewsI happened to turn on the Hannity show on Fox News last Friday evening.\nI asked Allison if she\u2019d shopped on the exchange, to see what a plan might cost under the new law.\n\u201cThese are the stories that the media refuses to cover,\u201d Hannity interjected.\nShe\u2019d told Hannity that she pays over $13,000 a year in premiums.\nNothing these folks were saying jibed with the basic facts of the Affordable Care Act as I understand them."}
