The two nations are working toward finalizing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade agreement with 10 other Pacific Rim nations.\n\nThe governments unveiled a new defense partnership Monday that would allow Japan to take a greater military role and act as a counterweight to China.\n\nAbe will also be the first Japanese leader in history to address a joint session of Congress.\n\nBut the visit won\u2019t be without some tension. Abe\u2019s views on the Second World War have raised concerns in the U.S. and among Japan's allies in Asia.\n\nAbe has downplayed some abuses carried out by the Japanese government during the war, particularly its recruitment of \u201ccomfort women,\u201d who were essentially used as sex slaves by the Japanese military, from South Korea.\n\nThe Lincoln Memorial is located directly across the Reflecting Pool from the World War II Memorial honoring U.S. service members who served during the conflict.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is here to boost trade and diplomatic ties.", "description": "Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is here to boost trade and diplomatic ties.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Blog Briefing Room"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is here to boost trade and diplomatic ties.", "title": "Obama, Japanese PM tour Lincoln Memorial", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/240216-obama-japanese-pm-tour-lincoln-memorial", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/obamaabe04272015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-27T17:22:59-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-04-27T17:22-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/240216-obama-japanese-pm-tour-lincoln-memorial", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-27T17:10-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Tristan Lejeune", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Jordan Fabian", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Trade, fast-track authority,Shinzo Abe, Barack Obama, Abraham Lincoln,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-27T17:10:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-27T17:22:59-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/240216-obama-japanese-pm-tour-lincoln-memorial", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is here to boost trade and diplomatic ties.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama, Japanese PM tour Lincoln Memorial"}, "dcterms.title": "Obama, Japanese PM tour Lincoln Memorial"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd4c1\"", "article_summary": "The Lincoln Memorial is located directly across the Reflecting Pool from the World War II Memorial honoring U.S. service members who served during the conflict.\nPresident Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe toured the Lincoln Memorial in Washington on Monday, as the Japanese leader kicks off a historic, weeklong visit to the United States.\nAbe\u2019s views on the Second World War have raised concerns in the U.S. and among Japan's allies in Asia.\nAbe has downplayed some abuses carried out by the Japanese government during the war, particularly its recruitment of \u201ccomfort women,\u201d who were essentially used as sex slaves by the Japanese military, from South Korea.\nAbe will also be the first Japanese leader in history to address a joint session of Congress."}
