Journal-isms asked some of them what they thought of how events in South Africa have been covered since Mandela\u2019s death on Dec. 5.\n\nSix\u2014all African American men\u2014responded by email with reactions ranging from praise to disgust to wondering whether the coverage would raise Africa in the American consciousness.

Please feel free to add it in the Comments section.\n\nSunni Khalid, freelance broadcast journalist:\n\n\u201cNPR won the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Silver Baton Award for our coverage of the election,\u201d in 1994 in which Mandela became South Africa\u2019s first democratically elected president. I was a Washington, D.C.-based diplomatic correspondent for NPR. I went in to South Africa in 1989 en route to Namibia for the Baltimore Sun.\u201d\n\nOn the current coverage, \u201cThe CNN stuff was the worst, describing Madiba in MLK terms as a \u2018man of peace!\u2019 For Chrissakes, he was imprisoned because he took up arms against the government! And he refused his release several times because he would not renounce the armed struggle. When he was released, it was because [South African President F.W.] De Klerk agreed to HIS terms, elections, freeing political prisoners and unbanning of the ANC [African National Congress], PAC [Pan Africanist Congress] and others. [One television reporter] told viewers that Winnie Mandela-Madikezela was his FIRST wife! The guy never read Mandela\u2019s bio. Everyone forgets his first wife, Evelyn Mase.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, these are egregious errors. And I got sick and damned tired of hearing white commentators talk about their fears that Mandela would emerge from prison and call for a racial bloodbath. That was never Madiba\u2019s option, nor the ANC\u2019s. They consistently preached full equality, which scared both white Americans and white South Africans. I almost got sent back by my editor for telling the IHT [International Herald Tribune] that white American journalists on the scene cared as much about black South Africans as they did black Americans, which was not at all. She might have if Bill Keller hadn\u2019t agreed with me!\u201d Keller was Johannesburg correspondent and later executive editor of the Times.\n\n\u201cI was there four times. The first time was October and November 1989, then November 1992, February 1994 and then March through May 1994. I cried at the airport when I left on May 13th because I was leaving.\u201d\n\nHoward W. French, a New York Times bureau chief for West and Central Africa, covered South Africa in the summer of 1995. He teaches journalism at Columbia University and is the author of \u201cA Continent for the Taking: The Tragedy and Hope of Africa\u201d:\n\n\u201cIn the ordinary course of things, hardly a week goes by in my life when I am not asked to explain to someone the reasons why Africa occupies such a small place in the American public consciousness and in the media in specific.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.theroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/1386888980.jpg?w=50", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theRoot", "site_name": "The Root", "description": "African-American reporters who covered South Africa\u2019s liberation struggle grade the media on its portrayal of Nelson Mandela\u2019s legacy.
