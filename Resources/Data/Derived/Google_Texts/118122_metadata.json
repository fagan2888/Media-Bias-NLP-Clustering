Do you think the lack of success with picking running backs early in the draft will scare Broncos general manager John Elway from taking somebody like Derrick Henry of Alabama?\n\nA.C., Parker\n\nKiz: Want a fun NFL fact to know and tell? Go back through every draft since 2011. Look at the top 125 players selected in those five drafts. The 625 choices have produced six running backs who have earned a berth in the Pro Bowl, but only two offensive tackles who have been invited to the league\u2019s all-star game. Maybe something to consider for folks who believe it would be safer and smarter for the Broncos to select an offensive tackle in the first round rather than a running back. So if not Henry with the 31st pick overall, expect the Broncos to beef up the running attack later in the draft, because the run is what makes coach Gary Kubiak\u2019s offense go. How about Alex Collins of Arkansas or C.J. Prosise of Notre Dame?\n\nSuspend Reyes. The Rockies should be hoping shortstop Jose Reyes is suspended for a long time without pay.\n\nMichael, Denver\n\nKiz: Although none of us here at Kickin\u2019 Headquarters is a threat to be nominated for the Supreme Court, we do believe in that quaint, old notion of innocent until proven guilty. So we\u2019ll let a judge and jury determine the truth during Reyes\u2019 criminal trial in Hawaii. At the time the trade went down last summer, I thought sending Troy Tulowitzki to Toronto in exchange for Reyes, whose defensive range seems to be weighed down by his $22 million salary, and young pitching prospects was a bad deal. Now it has a chance to be among the worst trades in Denver sports history.\n\nOops, wrong guy. I am so sorry, Kiz. You were not the one I was angry with. I should have checked the e-mail address used by my secretary. My e-mail was not supposed to go to you, but to Mike Klis of KUSA.\n\nRichard, master of social media\n\nKiz: No worries, my friend. It happens all the time. An irate sports fan composes some clever phrases, calling me a freakin\u2019 IDIOT (yes, in all caps) and suggesting I quit my job to get in the garbage business, because all I do is deal in garbage. But then, a few days later, in a moment of quiet reflection, there\u2019s that oops! moment. Hint: Klis is the handsome one. He works in television. By the way, I know Klis always appreciates being lambasted by folks who are actually mad at me.\n\nTrump a redhead? And today\u2019s parting shot teaches me something I did not know: Donald Trump\u2019s hair is red?\n\nKiz, you\u2019re quite the provocateur, better even than a redheaded presidential candidate.\n\nGary, Denver\n\nMark Kiszla: mkiszla@denverpost.com or @markkiszla", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kickin\u2019 it with Kiz: Is offensive tackle safer pick in NFL draft?", "title": "Kickin\u2019 it with Kiz: Is offensive tackle safer pick in NFL draft?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/27/kickin-it-with-kiz-is-offensive-tackle-safer-pick-in-nfl-draft/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160227__fc0aaf565657940a910f6a706700d14ep1.jpg", "height": 460}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160227__fc0aaf565657940a910f6a706700d14ep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-27T13:30:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:11:53+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Kickin' It With Kiz"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe201d\"", "article_summary": "By the way, I know Klis always appreciates being lambasted by folks who are actually mad at me.\nDo you think the lack of success with picking running backs early in the draft will scare Broncos general manager John Elway from taking somebody like Derrick Henry of Alabama?\nMaybe something to consider for folks who believe it would be safer and smarter for the Broncos to select an offensive tackle in the first round rather than a running back.\nSo if not Henry with the 31st pick overall, expect the Broncos to beef up the running attack later in the draft, because the run is what makes coach Gary Kubiak\u2019s offense go.\nPicking RBs early in draft."}
