That\u2019s how good it is! \u2014 Ann Coulter\n\nOur early fathers led our nation according to biblical principles. \u2018Hope and change\u2019 has become a clich\u00e9 in our nation, and it is daunting to think that any American could hope for change from what God has blessed. Our country is turning away from what has made it so great, but far greater than the government knowing our every move that could lead to losing our freedom to worship God publicly, is to know that God knows our every thought; he knows our hearts need transformation. \u2014 Billy Graham\n\nThe political disfunction that has brought about the shutdown and now threatens default, isn\u2019t so much gridlock. It is exposing the fatal flaw in our Constitution and highly distinct system of government. In other words, it\u2019s the Constitution\u2019s fault. Something truly catastrophic was bound to happen sooner or later. \u2014 Chris Hayes\n\nI\u2019m talking basically about Ted Cruz, who was saying if we voted in the House to defund Obamacare, he could manage to both keep the government open and defund Obamacare. The fact is, it was done in the House and the government is now closed and Obamacare is going forward. This was a strategy that never could work. It was almost sort of a nullification, to say we\u2019re going to shut down the government if we don\u2019t defund a law that we don\u2019t like.\u201d [\u2026] We are the ones who did shut the government down. You don\u2019t take the dramatic step of shutting down the government unless you have a real strategy. \u2014 Peter King\n\nThe idea is that porn \u2014 and romantic comedies and promiscuous sex and even religion \u2014 can all become addictive ways of losing yourself in a fantasy in order to avoid connecting with other people, and maybe losing yourself in them. This is all true and very relevant in the connected but weirdly disconnected world we now live in.\n\nI especially appreciated the comparison between porn \u2014 in which the women have perfect bodies and do all sorts of stuff that real girls aren\u2019t always willing to do \u2014 and romantic comedies, in which men find salvation through apologizing to their girlfriends and subjugating themselves to feminine values. \u2014 Andrew Klavan\n\n[N]ormally, I don\u2019t comment at all on closed-door meetings between Republican senators,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty strict rule we follow. But one exception I\u2019ll make is circumstances like this, where contents of the meeting were leaked deliberately by several of my colleagues and leaked in a very one-sided way. I\u2019m happy to tell you about it here. It was an all-out attack against Ted Cruz and me,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt was unflattering. It was unfair. It was demeaning. It was demeaning to Sen. Cruz and me, but more than anything, it was demeaning to those who engaged in the attack. \u2026I have to ask the question \u2014 why weren\u2019t those who leaked this and leaked it in an unflattering and unfavorable way \u2014 why were they not willing to attach their names to those quotes?\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, Ted Cruz and I spoke after the meeting and you know, we would both be fine with the American people seeing and hearing what we said in that meeting. But we\u2019re pretty sure most of our colleagues would be very uncomfortable and downright embarrassed if their constituents saw the way they were behaving. \u2014 Mike Lee\n\nAs some of you may know, our team began 81 years ago \u2014 in 1932 \u2014 with the name \u201cBoston Braves.\u201d The following year, the franchise name was changed to the \u201cBoston Redskins.\u201d On that inaugural Redskins team, four players and our Head Coach were Native Americans. The name was never a label. It was, and continues to be, a badge of honor.\n\nIn 1971, our legendary coach, the late George Allen, consulted with the Red Cloud Athletic Fund located on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota and designed our emblem on the Redskins helmets. Several years later, Coach Allen was honored by the Red Cloud Athletic Fund. On the wall at our Ashburn, Virginia, offices is the plaque given to Coach Allen \u2014 a source of pride for all of us. \u201cWashington Redskins is more than a name we have called our football team for over eight decades. It is a symbol of everything we stand for: strength, courage, pride, and respect \u2014 the same values we know guide Native Americans and which are embedded throughout their rich history as the original Americans. \u2014 Daniel Snyder\n\nIf the continued existence of mathematics depended on the ability of the Republicans to defend the proposition that two plus two equals four, that would probably mean the end of mathematics and of all the things that require mathematics. \u2014 Thomas Sowell\n\nThe conventional wisdom of the U.S. media is that Republicans are being grossly irresponsible not just to wave through another couple trillion or so on Washington\u2019s overdraft facility. Really? Other countries are actually reducing debt: New Zealand, for example, has a real budget that diminishes net debt from 26 percent of GDP to 17 percent by 2020. By comparison, America\u2019s net debt is currently about 88 percent, and we\u2019re debating only whether to increase it automatically or with a few ineffectual strings attached. \u2014 Mark Steyn\n\nFirst of all, there is zero chance that the U.S. government is going to default on its debt. It\u2019s unfortunate that people have conflated this idea of not raising the debt ceiling immediately on October 17 with somehow defaulting on our debt. We bring in in tax revenue about 12 times as much money as it takes to pay our interest on our debt. There is no way that any Treasury secretary or administration would willfully choose to have the catastrophic results that would occur if we actually defaulted on our debt when it\u2019s not necessary. So this is pretty well understood in financial circles. You see Treasury prices have barely moved through this entire episode. But I\u2019ve got legislation that would simply codify and formalize the obligation to make sure that under no circumstances we would default on our debt. Interestingly, the White House doesn\u2019t want that legislation. They\u2019ve threatened to veto it precisely because they want to be able to hold the specter of a catastrophe in front of Republicans to cow us and intimidate us into giving the president what he wants, which is a whole lot of additional borrowing authority with no reforms whatsoever, and I think that\u2019s irresponsible. \u2014 Pat Toomey\n\nThe question not addressed by black people is whether what black politicians are getting for their support of a failed educational system is worth the sacrifice of whole generations of black youngsters, educationally handicapping them and making many virtually useless in the high-tech world of the 21st century. Though many black politicians mouth that we should fix, not abandon, public schools, they themselves have abandoned public schools. They see their children as too precious to be sacrificed in the name of public education. \u2014 Walter Williams", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "This week in quotes: October 4-10, 2013 A Republican who doesn\u2019t care about Bank of America checks wasn\u2019t possible before the Tea Party. \u2014 Timothy Carney If you are in the minority of Americans not already unalterably opposed to Obamacare, keep in mind that the only reason the government is shut down right now is \u2026", "title": "Top quotes of the week", "locale": {"alternate": "en_US", "identifier": "en_US"}, "image": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Ann-Coulter-Twitter.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-10-12T05:22:05+00:00", "url": "http://www.bizpacreview.com/2013/10/11/top-quotes-of-the-week-4-85036", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "alexaVerifyID": "qC73ojZoktel85cbl12SAFJar9k", "fb": {"admins": "10152426200106417,10152720237657852,10200650572686956,3854753687919,100215693385946,549853448412696", "pages": 169204449790211, "app_id": 1502886339979348}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ConservativeNewsToday", "section": "News", "published_time": "2013-10-11T06:39:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-12T05:22:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a70\"", "article_summary": "This week in quotes: October 4-10, 2013A Republican who doesn\u2019t care about Bank of America checks wasn\u2019t possible before the Tea Party.\n\u2026I have to ask the question \u2014 why weren\u2019t those who leaked this and leaked it in an unflattering and unfavorable way \u2014 why were they not willing to attach their names to those quotes?\u201d he said.\nThe fact is, it was done in the House and the government is now closed and Obamacare is going forward.\nThough many black politicians mouth that we should fix, not abandon, public schools, they themselves have abandoned public schools.\n\u2014 Billy GrahamThe political disfunction that has brought about the shutdown and now threatens default, isn\u2019t so much gridlock."}
