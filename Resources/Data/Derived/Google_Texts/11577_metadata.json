Fiorina describes herself as \u201creasonably confident\u201d she will be a competitive candidate, and gives substantive answers on a wide variety of topics ranging from tax reform to foreign policy and social issues.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe style of Fiorina\u2019s announcement \u2014 a Tweet and video \u2014 drew comparisons to Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton, but the similarities end there. Clinton, who made her announcement weeks ago, has shunned the press and has yet to sit for an interview with a national journalist. In contrast, Fiorina kicked off her announcement day with an appearance on Good Morning America, followed by a conference call with dozens of reporters from national media outlets, including Breitbart News. She also was interviewed by Katie Couric and Sean Hannity, and has several more scheduled for the rest of the day.\n\nFiorina also promoted an appearance on the live videostreaming app Periscope that took place at 4:00 pm ET Monday.\n\nI\u2019ll be live on @periscopeco at 4 pm EST & I want to hear from you. http://t.co/yLxdsJF9Q7 pic.twitter.com/M6pdIOsDao \u2014 Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) May 4, 2015\n\nShe accepted questions submitted through Periscope\u2019s chat function or on Twitter with the hashtag #Carly2016. Deputy Campaign Manager Sarah Flores screened the questions, and picked a broad mix of topics, mostly serious, but some more lighthearted. It should be noted that Flores included several tough questions about Fiorina\u2019s status as a political newcomer and challenges during her tenure at Hewlett-Packard, and Fiorina did not shy away from answering them either \u2014 again, another contrast to Clinton, who has given only the slimmest of responses to questions about financial improprieties and influence peddling at the Clinton Foundation.\n\nThe following article is a summary of Fiorina\u2019s responses to questions from the media during the morning press call and the public questions from Twitter and Periscope. Fiorina\u2019s Periscope interview is available at this link for the next twenty-four hours.\n\nCampaign and Fundraising Plans\n\n\u201cI think we have time,\u201d said Fiorina. \u201cThere has been a greater reception to my candidacy than I think many might have expected, and we continue to see that in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina and elsewhere.\u201d\n\nFiorina\u2019s plan is \u201cto continue to meet with as many people as possible\u2026to talk about why someone outside the professional political class makes the most sense now at this pivotal point in our nation.\u201d As Breitbart News reported, Fiorina\u2019s announcement video also centered on this theme, attacking Clinton for belonging to this \u201cprofessional political class.\u201d\n\n\u201cNearly everything about me is different\u201d from the other candidates, said Fiorina, noting that only retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who also launched his campaign today, had also never held political office. However, Fiorina emphasized that she was \u201cnot a political neophyte,\u201d saying that she understood how the world works, how the economy works, and had met more world leaders than any other candidate except, of course, for Clinton, who was First Lady and Secretary of State.\n\nIn response to a question about why she featured Clinton in her video, Fiorina responded that it was because she was the likely Democratic nominee, and that she would still be running for president regardless of who was running on the Democratic ticket. \u201cShe is the personification of the professional political class,\u201d said Fiorina. \u201cShe and her husband have been in politics their entire lives\u2026she reminds people that there is a huge disconnect between that political class and the hopes and concerns of hardworking Americans everywhere.\u201d\n\nFiorina acknowledged that she would not raise as much money as other candidates, \u201cbut we\u2019ll raise sufficient money.\u201d Clinton \u201cis going to have more money than anybody, that\u2019s just a fact,\u201d but Fiorina said that she would \u201crun a different kind of campaign\u201d and would spend the money she raised wisely, so that she would be able to be competitive and \u201cdo what we need to do.\u201d\n\nThe Republican Party has not yet announced what the requirements will be to qualify to participate in the presidential debates that will begin this August, but Fiorina said that she was \u201creasonably confident\u201d that she would \u201cmake sufficient progress to be on that debate stage.\u201d Currently polling in the low single digits, Fiorina said that she was \u201cnot particularly concerned\u201d about them at this point, and pointed to several other factors that she believed could show momentum for a candidate, like endorsements and crowd sizes at events.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my first day, we\u2019ve got a long way to go,\u201d Fiorina said, adding that her campaign planned to spend a lot of time in the early primary states and was encouraged by the reception she had received so far. She had made similar comments in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News last week.\n\nFiorina also rejected the idea of reaching out to specific groups of voters, saying that \u201cour party needs to be united, not divided; actually our nation needs to united, not divided.\u201d She explained that she talks \u201cto all kinds of primary voters, [and] I talk to all of them in the same way.\u201d\n\nShe acknowledged that she had lost her only previous attempt at elected office, a 2010 attempt to unseat Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA), but also noted that California is not only a deeply blue state, the California Republican Party is drastically outmatched by the Democrats in terms of ground game there. Still, Fiorina was proud of the 57 percent she won in the Republican primary and the number of Independent and Democratic crossover votes she won.\n\nEconomic Policy and Tax Reform\n\n\u201cIn order to create more jobs, we need to get the real economic engine of this country going and growing again\u2026small businesses, new businesses, and family-owned businesses,\u201d said Fiorina, \u201cand they are being crushed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are now destroying more businesses than we are creating for the first time in U.S. history,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat is a terrible fact.\u201d\n\nThe solution, according to Fiorina, is to \u201cthrottle back the pile of complexity\u201d that small and new businesses are facing. While she was adamant that \u201crates are too high, across the board,\u201d Fiorina advocated for a \u201cwholesale tax reform,\u201d not just \u201ctweaking\u201d the rates or \u201ctinkering around the edges,\u201d but to start over with a less complex and fairer system.\n\n\u201cSimplicity is as important as the rates,\u201d she said, explaining that the extreme complexity of the tax code was a harsh burden on small businesses. \u201cComplexity always tilts the playing field to the big and the powerful and the well-connected.\u201d\n\nFiorina elaborated more on this topic with Breitbart News last week, advocating for a substantial, across the board reform of the tax code and regulations that affect American businesses. \u201cWe have to start undoing some things,\u201d she said. \u201cLiterally, undoing some things. Undoing the complexity of the tax code. Undoing the regulatory thicket. So that these economic drivers can breathe and flourish.\u201d\n\nForeign Policy\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Fiorina said that her first call as president would be to the Prime Minister of Israel, to reaffirm the traditional friendship between our two countries, followed by one to Iran with a strict message that the United States would impose sanctions until Iran consented to allow \u201cfull and unfettered inspections\u201d of its nuclear facilities. \u201cWe need to stop talking to Iran,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a bad deal in every respect [and] it\u2019s going to get worse between now and June.\u201d\n\nRegarding China, Fiorina said that country is \u201cof increasing concern,\u201d noting that \u201cas a trading partner, they have not operated in an above-board fashion.\u201d Fiorina recalled China\u2019s lobbying efforts to become a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and how they had made a number of significant commitments regarding intellectual property protections and fair access to Chinese markets, but so far have failed to meet these commitments.\n\n\u201cWe need to be very firm with the Chinese about how they play the trade game,\u201d said Fiorina. She also supported working with other allies in the region, including Australia and India, to make sure that China\u2019s assertiveness did not go unchecked.\n\nFiorina identified another of her foreign policy priorities as \u201cto finally push back against [Russian President] Vladimir Putin.\u201d Noting how Putin had consolidated political, military and economic power, and was \u201cmaking real progress on territorial power\u201d but was \u201cbasically not being challenged at all.\u201d Fiorina criticized the Obama administration as \u201cproviding a false choice\u201d between its weak approach and going to war. \u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d she said, quickly running through a list of several other options she supported:\n\nWe should begin rebuilding the Sixth Fleet [the U.S. Naval fleet and staff based in Europe], we should rebuild the missile defense program, we should conduct regular military exercises in the Baltic States, and we should have armed the Ukrainians quite awhile ago. All of those things would send a very clear message.\n\nThe Middle East \u201cis obviously a top priority,\u201d added Fiorina. \u201cThere are very specific things that our allies have asked us to do to help them fight ISIS; we haven\u2019t done any of them,\u201d including arming the Kurds, providing bombs and material to Jordan as King Abdullah requested and sharing intelligence regarding ISIS with the Egyptians.\n\nChris Moody, CNN\u2019s Senior Digital Correspondent, did an in-depth look at Fiorina\u2019s foreign policy experience, including her work with the CIA\u2019s External Advisory Board, and other advisory work with the Pentagon and National Security Agency.\n\nHewlett-Packard\n\nFiorina\u2019s business experience is part of the foundation of her campaign, especially regarding her positions on economic issues, but her work at Hewlett-Packard was controversial, including the layoff of some 30,000 employees. Her tenure ended when the board forced her to resign in 2005.\n\nNoting that the early 2000s were extremely challenging for the entire technology sector \u2014 the \u201cworst technology recession in twenty-five years\u201d \u2014 Fiorina said that many companies, not just Hewlett-Packard, lost half their stock value during that time. The NASDAQ stock index, according to Fiorina, only recovered back to where it was before the dot com bubble burst just a week or so ago.\n\nFiorina touted a quick list of accomplishments while she was CEO at Hewlett-Packard: taking the company from $44 billion to almost $90 billion, growth rate from 2 percent to 4 percent, tripled the rate of innovation to 11 patents a day, and quadrupled cash flow.\n\n\u201cWe transformed a company that was lagging behind in every single category to leading in every single category, and it takes leadership to grow a company. It takes leadership to grow an economy. It takes leadership to grow a nation. And growth is very important if we\u2019re going to put people back to work.\u201d\n\nStill, Fiorina acknowledged, the layoffs were a \u201cvery difficult time,\u201d and there was \u201cnothing worse as a chief executive\u201d than having to tell people they no longer have a job. She added that she was proud of the severance benefits and career counseling the company offered laid-off workers, which she described as more generous than was industry standard.\n\nImmigration\n\nBreitbart News\u2019 Alex Swoyer covered Fiorina\u2019s comments on immigration, where she said that \u201cthe privilege of citizenship should be left to those who worked hard and did it the right way,\u201d a position consistent with her remarks in Iowa last week. She also advocated for stronger border security measures as the necessary first priority, noting that both our southern and northern borders were unsecured and vulnerable.\n\nAbortion\n\nFiorina\u2019s comments on abortion Monday morning were consistent with her interview with Breitbart News last week on the same topic, where she proudly stated her pro-life beliefs and described the Democrats\u2019 position on the controversial issue as the one that was extreme:\n\nPeople are completely unaware of how extreme the Democratic Party has become on this issue. So when I tell people that the Democratic platform basically is any abortion at any time for any reason at any point in a woman\u2019s pregnancy right up until the last minute, to be paid for by taxpayers, people are shocked. Barbara Boxer in 2010 described her policy as \u201cit\u2019s not a life until it leaves the hospital.\u201d Nobody agrees with that. And so, the truth is, even on this issue\u2026young people are far more pro-life than they were a decade ago, because of all the science, the majority of women, the majority of young people, the majority of Americans actually, have found common ground on the issue of abortion after five months. We now know, at five months, a fetus can feel pain. And so I think, even on this issue, there is common ground and there is a way to talk about this issue that\u2019s not judgmental, that\u2019s not angry, that\u2019s not vitriolic, it\u2019s authentic and empathetic, which is how I hope I always come across.\n\nGay Rights\n\nFiorina said that she has been \u201cupfront\u201d on her position on gay rights issues since her 2010 campaign. She has \u201calways supported civil unions,\u201d and provided benefits to same-sex couples when she was CEO of Hewlett-Packard.\n\n\u201cI think that government cannot bestow benefits in a discriminatory fashion,\u201d said Fiorina, \u201cbut I also know that for millions and millions of us, marriage has a spiritual foundation. It is a religious institution and only a man and woman can create life, which is a gift that comes from God, and while not everyone may agree with us, I think it it vitally important that we respect and protect people\u2019s rights to hold that view.\u201d\n\nFiorina continued that she hoped America would \u201ccome to a place in our nation where we can be respectful and tolerant of different views\u201d on this issue.\n\nOn the specific issue of allowing benefits for same-sex partners of federal workers, Fiorina was generally supportive of the concept, as it matched the company\u2019s policy when she was at Hewlett-Packard, but would want to examine the details of how the Obama administration had enacted the policy before endorsing it specifically.\n\nObamacare\n\nA better alternative to Obamacare, said Fiorina, would be to allow states to administer high risk pools and other competitive free-market solutions. She cited New Hampshire as an example of a state that had been using a high risk pool to effectively provide health insurance coverage for their people before Obamacare destroyed that option.\n\nWe need to try what we have never tried in the health insurance market, which is actually the free market\u2026Insurance has been a regulated oligopoly for decades and decades and decades\u2026we need to try the free market, which actually provides for real competition. We know that real competition provides greater choices, greater value, and lower prices\u2026 Obamacare needs to be repealed. The law itself is longer than a Harry Potter novel. It is accompanied by tens of thousands of pages of additional regulation.\n\nCriminal Justice Reform\n\nFiorina reiterated her support for police body cameras and cameras in prisoner transport vehicles that she had mentioned in her interview with Breitbart News in the aftermath of the riots in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray.\n\nRegarding the broader issue of criminal justice reform, Fiorina praised the work of \u201ca number of Republican governors who have made great strides around criminal justice reform,\u201d including \u201cdecriminalizing drug addiction and drug use,\u201d reducing prison populations and violent crime. \u201cDrug addiction shouldn\u2019t be criminalized,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to treat it appropriately, and when you look at the stats, it\u2019s clear that a lot of what goes on in an inner city like Baltimore is sort of like an industry: you have a lot of young people who are getting access to drugs and then they\u2019re getting arrested frequently. It\u2019s just a bad, bad cycle.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately, of course, we need to create a circumstance in which people have a stake in their community, and they have a stake in their community because they believe their community offers them possibilities for a future.\u201d\n\nCollege Affordability\n\nIn response to a Periscope question about student loan debt, Fiorina criticized the Obama administration for nationalizing the student loan industry. Before, it had been a competitive industry and parents and students had choices. Fiorina made the comparison to the technology industry \u2014 \u201cthe most competitive in the world\u201d \u2014 as one where consumers kept getting access to better and cheaper devices.\n\nThe federal takeover of the student loan industry did not just destroy choice, said Fiorina, it also resulted in higher interest rates.\n\nFiorina added a short comment in support of choice at all levels of education, from K-12 through college.\n\nEqual Pay\n\nA Periscope questioner asked about equal pay for equal work, and Fiorina noted that this was already the law of the United States and had been since the 1960s. Since it is already illegal to pay a woman less for the same job, the issue, in Fiorina\u2019s view, was how job positions were evaluated by employers.\n\nThe \u201csingle greatest equal pay issue,\u201d according to Fiorina, was the seniority system, where employees are paid more the longer they are at the same job. This system \u2014 currently used by the federal government and labor unions \u2014 can disadvantage women, who often take time off to raise children, or enter the workforce later after their children are grown.\n\nFiorina supports a meritocracy system, paying on performance instead of seniority. This was the system she instituted at Hewlett-Packard and she stated that she would seek to end the seniority system in the federal government if she were president.\n\nResponse to Clinton Foundation Scandals\n\nFiorina noted that she had served as the chairman of two major charities. \u201cAll I can say to you, is that when a charitable institution has to restate 990s [the IRS annual reporting form for tax-exempt organizations], not once but multiple times, that says it all.\u201d\n\nShe slammed both Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s attitude asking people to \u201cjust trust us,\u201d saying that their record did not support granting such trust, especially with so many unanswered questions. \u201cTrust is earned, through transparency, and I think they have not been particularly transparent on a whole host of things.\u201d\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nIn a short \u201crapid response\u201d segment on Periscope, Fiorina revealed that she does not like hot dogs, prefers mermaids to unicorns because they were her granddaughters\u2019 favorites, and her new favorite ice cream was a \u201cchocolate chocolate truffle\u201d she had tried during a visit to New Hampshire last week.\n\nFiorina also said that she \u201cused to be fluent\u201d in Italian, but had probably gotten a little rusty, and also had a \u201creading knowledge\u201d of French, German, and Spanish.\n\nFollow Sarah Rumpf on Twitter @rumpfshaker.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Unlike Hillary Clinton, Carly Fiorina Welcomes Tough Questions from Media, Public", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Unlike Hillary Clinton, Carly Fiorina Welcomes Tough Questions from Media, Public", "title": "Unlike Hillary Clinton, Carly Fiorina Welcomes Tough Questions from Media, Public - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Carly-Fiorina.jpg", "height": 755}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/04/unlike-hillary-clinton-carly-fiorina-welcomes-tough-questions-from-media-public/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Unlike Hillary Clinton, Carly Fiorina Welcomes Tough Questions from Media, Public", "title": "Unlike Hillary Clinton, Carly Fiorina Welcomes Tough Questions from Media, Public - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Carly-Fiorina.jpg", "creator": "@rumpfshaker", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 elections, 2016 Republican Presidential Primary, Abortion, Baltimore, Carly Fiorina, China, civil unions, criminal justice reform, foreign policy, Gay Marriage, Hillary Clinton, Iran, ISIS, pro-life, Russia, trade policy,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "trade policy", "published_time": "2015-05-04T15:57:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "The following article is a summary of Fiorina\u2019s responses to questions from the media during the morning press call and the public questions from Twitter and Periscope.\nhttp://t.co/yLxdsJF9Q7 pic.twitter.com/M6pdIOsDao \u2014 Carly Fiorina (@CarlyFiorina) May 4, 2015She accepted questions submitted through Periscope\u2019s chat function or on Twitter with the hashtag #Carly2016.\nDeputy Campaign Manager Sarah Flores screened the questions, and picked a broad mix of topics, mostly serious, but some more lighthearted.\nFiorina also promoted an appearance on the live videostreaming app Periscope that took place at 4:00 pm ET Monday.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe style of Fiorina\u2019s announcement \u2014 a Tweet and video \u2014 drew comparisons to Democrat frontrunner Hillary Clinton, but the similarities end there."}
