The myth dates back to the 1920s and was started by fascist sympathizers who wanted to perpetuate the belief that Jews were somehow undermining Western civilization through subterfuge. It\u2019s always been a myth less about Christmas itself and more a way to convey the idea that white Christian conservatives are the \u201ctrue\u201d Americans and everyone else is a dangerous subversive. While Jews have been eclipsed by Muslims, feminists, black people, gays and generic \u201cliberals\u201d as the hated element supposedly stealing the country, the narrative has stayed the same.\n\nIn the year of Donald Trump, when white Christian conservatives are all revved up to fight for their supposed right to cultural dominance, it makes sense that they would go right back to screaming about how the subversives are stealing a holiday they believe belongs to them.\n\nWell, it doesn\u2019t, and not just because the Christmas spirit is supposed to be one of generosity, not selfish boundary-policing over who is and isn\u2019t a \u201creal\u201d American. While the story of Jesus\u2019 birth has a lot of meaning for a lot of people, the fact of the matter is that Christmas has always been about more than that and its roots go far deeper than the myth of a savior born in Bethlehem.\n\nChristmas is, at its heart, a secular holiday. It has survived as long as it has because of its secular nature, which means it\u2019s flexible and can be whatever the people of a certain time and place need it to be. That doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s wrong to use it as a religious holiday, if that\u2019s what works for you. But it does mean that it\u2019s equally fine for non-Christians to celebrate it if they want, or for people to have as much or little religion as they want in their holiday season. It\u2019s not a holiday about how white Christian conservatives are better than everyone else, that\u2019s for damn sure.\n\nIn his new book, \u201cThe Myths That Stole Christmas,\u201d philosophy professor David Kyle Johnson explores the pagan roots of Christmas. (Many of his ideas are explained in this half-hour interview for Point of Inquiry.) The idea that Jesus was born in late December appears to be a medieval Catholic Church invention in order to discourage the celebration of winter solstice holidays like Saturnalia that were associated with pagan religions.\n\nBut even though the church was successful in replacing these celebrations with the unsubtly named Christ\u2019s Mass, a lot of pagan traditions hung on through the centuries. As Johnson lays out, the old pagan tradition of nobles playing servant for a day to the common folk of the area evolved into a tradition called \u201cwassailing.\u201d where feudal lords and other wealthy people would share their wealth, in the form of food and drink, for a day with common people who showed up their door, usually drunk, and singing for gifts. This, in turn, morphed into Christmas caroling as we know it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "What \"War on Christmas\" believers don't get is that the holiday is an amalgamation of many beliefs and traditions", "title": "Putting the \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d to rest: Fox News, sorry to break it to you but it\u2019s always been a secular holiday", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "What \"War on Christmas\" believers don't get is that the holiday is an amalgamation of many beliefs and traditions", "title": "Putting the \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d to rest: Fox News, sorry to break it to you but it\u2019s always been a secular holiday", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/25/putting_the_war_on_christmas_to_rest_fox_news_sorry_to_break_it_to_you_but_its_always_been_a_secular_holiday/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/santas.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "What \"War on Christmas\" believers don't get is that the holiday is an amalgamation of many beliefs and traditions", "title": "Putting the \u201cWar on Christmas\u201d to rest: Fox News, sorry to break it to you but it\u2019s always been a secular holiday", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/santas.jpg", "creator": "@AmandaMarcotte", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Amanda Marcotte", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Fox News, Megyn Kelly, secular christmas, War on Christmas", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Christmas is, at its heart, a secular holiday.\nIn his new book, \u201cThe Myths That Stole Christmas,\u201d philosophy professor David Kyle Johnson explores the pagan roots of Christmas.\nThat the myth that liberals somehow hate Christmas would come back this year makes perfect sense.\nIt\u2019s not a holiday about how white Christian conservatives are better than everyone else, that\u2019s for damn sure.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s wrong to use it as a religious holiday, if that\u2019s what works for you."}
