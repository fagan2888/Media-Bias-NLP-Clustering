Teva had sought to make a generic, prompting Glaxo to file a patent infringement lawsuit.\n\nTo make the lawsuit disappear, Glaxo didn\u2019t make a cash payment to Teva, but did agree to allow Teva to sell generic chewable and tablet forms of Lamictal before the patent expired. Significantly, Glaxo also agreed not to sell its own so-called authorized generic version, the sort of move that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission argued also has substantial value.\n\nThe decision underscores the extent to which patent settlements are likely to undergo sustained scrutiny following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year that drug makers can face lawsuits over so-called pay-to-delay settlements, because such deals should not necessarily be assumed to be illegal.\n\nIn these arrangements, a brand-name drug maker reaches a settlement to a generic rival in exchange for ending patent litigation and launching a copycat medicine at a future date.\n\nAlso known as reverse settlements, these emerged as an unintended consequence of the Hatch-Waxman Act that was designed to accelerate access to lower-cost generics. The FTC has long contended, however, some of these deals are anticompetitive, because generic drug makers are given incentives to file lawsuits against brand-name rivals but then settle for a quick profit, or something of value, rather than challenge a patent in court.\n\nIn reaching his decision, however, Walls concluded that the Supreme Court ruling applies only to reverse settlements that involve money. Although two \u201cother district courts have found that [the Supreme Court ruling] applies to nonmonetary patent settlements, this court finds their readings\u2026 unpersuasive,\u201d he wrote in referring to separate rulings last fall concerning patent settlements for the Lipitor cholesterol pill and the Nexium acid reflux pill. In both cases, money changed hands.\n\nThe differing findings suggest that more patent deals may be subject to antitrust review, according to Robert Liebenluft, a partner at the Hogan & Lovells law firm, who specializes in antitrust matters and was formerly assistant director for health care in the FTC Bureau of Competition. \u201cThis is just one case,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it is an important issue. And we now have split decisions.\n\n\u201cIf the arrangement is much broader than [cash], it opens the door to look at the underlying economics of the deal, and it may be hard to value some of those things\u2026 I think you could end up subjecting a lot more settlements to wide-ranging reviews and raise more things to dispute, and potentially more litigation.\u201d\n\nAdds Scott Hemphill, a professor at Columbia Law School who specializes in antitrust issues and intellectual property: \u201cThe district court\u2019s opinion is pretty surprising. The idea that cash counts as payment but anything else \u2013 gold bullion, land \u2013 would not, just because the Supreme Court said \u2018cash,\u2019 is contrary to the thrust of the opinion and defies common sense.\n\n\u201cIn terms of enforcement priorities, I would expect the FTC to pursue noncash payments just as readily as cash payments. After all, they are functionally the same thing. And as settlements have moved to more sophisticated forms of payment for delay, it\u2019s important that the FTC keep pace with that development.\u201d\n\nIn short, the definition of reverse payment is now up for debate. And that means drug makers may have to be more careful than ever before in structuring settlements.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Cash may be king, but should a cash payment be used as a litmus test for whether a patent settlement between drug makers deserves anti-trust scrutiny?", "title": "Drug Makers and Antitrust: Is Cash All That Matters?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/03/19/drug-makers-and-anti-trust-is-cash-all-that-matters/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BW429_bayer0_P_20140312040118.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Drug Makers and Antitrust: Is Cash All That Matters?", "description": "Cash may be king, but should a cash payment be used as a litmus test for whether a patent settlement between drug makers deserves anti-trust scrutiny?", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Tom Gara", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "Cash may be king, but should a cash payment be used as a litmus test for whether a patent settlement between drug makers deserves anti-trust scrutiny?", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-03-19T20:25:57-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/03/19/drug-makers-and-anti-trust-is-cash-all-that-matters/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-4042", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Cash may be king, but should a cash payment be used as a litmus test for whether a patent settlement between drug makers deserves anti-trust scrutiny?", "title": "Drug Makers and Antitrust: Is Cash All That Matters?", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/03/19/drug-makers-and-anti-trust-is-cash-all-that-matters/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BW429_bayer0_P_20140312040118.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-4042", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-03-19T21:10:32-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc96a3\"", "article_summary": "CorbisBy Ed SilvermanCash may be king, but should a cash payment be used as a litmus test for whether a patent settlement between drug makers deserves antitrust scrutiny?\nIn reaching his decision, however, Walls concluded that the Supreme Court ruling applies only to reverse settlements that involve money.\nAnd that means drug makers may have to be more careful than ever before in structuring settlements.\nThe idea that cash counts as payment but anything else \u2013 gold bullion, land \u2013 would not, just because the Supreme Court said \u2018cash,\u2019 is contrary to the thrust of the opinion and defies common sense.\n\u201cIn terms of enforcement priorities, I would expect the FTC to pursue noncash payments just as readily as cash payments."}
