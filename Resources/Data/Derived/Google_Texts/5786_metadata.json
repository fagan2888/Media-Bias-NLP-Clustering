These issues are the level and composition of enrollment, and how insurance exchanges exacerbate revenue pressures on hospitals,\u201d said Moody\u2019s Associate Managing Director Lisa Goldstein in the report.\n\n[See also: Moody's reports weaker hospital finances.]\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office is estimating that 7 million individuals will participate in the exchanges in 2014, and some of those enrolling on the public exchanges will previously have had commercial insurance, says Moody\u2019s. The exchange-based insurance could reimburse hospitals at a lower amount than a patient\u2019s previous insurance carrier did, and the lower reimbursement rates will contribute to lower revenue growth for hospitals in 2014, said the report.\n\nThe report also mentioned that there would likely be a timing mismatch between when hospitals should experience savings from fewer uninsured patients, reductions in Medicare rates, and Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share (DSH) reimbursements that also began on October 1, 2013. If fewer patients end up purchasing insurance on the exchanges, hospitals will end up absorbing the rate reductions without the corresponding reductions in uncompensated care.\n\nAdditionally, Moody\u2019s expects hospital bad debt to rise because new enrollees previously insured by a commercial payer are likely to sign on to plans with high co-pays and deductibles, which they may ultimately be unable to pay. Moody\u2019s also expects some delays in receiving payments and processing claims among insurers offering products on the public exchanges, because they will tend to be smaller and less experienced, and will take time to come up to speed.\n\n[See also: HIX plan premiums won\u2019t firm until 2016.]", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/moodys-health-exchanges-credit-risk-most-us-hospitals", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "According to a new report by Moody's Investors Service, the health insurance exchanges mandated by the Affordable Care Act may increase risks to credit quality that will pressure not-for-profit hospital revenues in 2014.", "title": "Moody's: Health exchanges a credit risk for most U.S. hospitals"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/modules/open_graph/hfn-stacked.jpeg"}, "title": "Moody's: Health exchanges a credit risk for most U.S. hospitals", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "According to a new report by Moody's Investors Service, the health insurance exchanges mandated by the Affordable Care Act may increase risks to credit quality that will pressure not-for-profit hospital revenues in 2014."}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "According to a new report by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, the health insurance exchanges mandated by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) may increase risks to credit quality that will pressure not-for-profit hospital revenues in 2014.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9808\"", "article_summary": "These issues are the level and composition of enrollment, and how insurance exchanges exacerbate revenue pressures on hospitals,\u201d said Moody\u2019s Associate Managing Director Lisa Goldstein in the report.\nAccording to a new report by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, the health insurance exchanges mandated by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) may increase risks to credit quality that will pressure not-for-profit hospital revenues in 2014.\nIf fewer patients end up purchasing insurance on the exchanges, hospitals will end up absorbing the rate reductions without the corresponding reductions in uncompensated care.\nThe Congressional Budget Office is estimating that 7 million individuals will participate in the exchanges in 2014, and some of those enrolling on the public exchanges will previously have had commercial insurance, says Moody\u2019s.\nThe exchange-based insurance could reimburse hospitals at a lower amount than a patient\u2019s previous insurance carrier did, and the lower reimbursement rates will contribute to lower revenue growth for hospitals in 2014, said the report."}
