Now, certain regulators are looking to do away with the system as it\u2019s currently structured.\n\n\u201cThe password system should have been dead and buried many years ago,\u201d New York\u2019s top financial regulator, Benjamin Lawsky, said Wednesday in a speech at Columbia Law School. \u201cAnd it is time that we bury it now.\u201d\n\nRelated: Thank the U.S. Government for Lousy Internet Security\n\nFollowing a spate of security breaches affecting millions of consumers at major retailers, banks and even government social media sites, Lawsky isn\u2019t the only lawmaker to urging companies to adopt tougher security measures. President Obama has recently been speaking about the need for improved cybersecurity as a matter of national defense.\n\nThe Treasury Department is also carrying the torch. \u201cEnhancing the nation\u2019s cybersecurity is a top policy priority for the president and the Treasury Department,\u201d Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin told the Texas Bankers\u2019 Association last December.\n\nBut Lawsky is the first to go after passwords specifically. His proposals, outlined in his recent speech, could include having financial companies drop simple password protection in favor of multi-factor authentication \u2014 a security system that requires users to enter a second, newly generated code, sometimes sent to your phone or a key-fob type of device.\n\nIf Lawsky\u2019s office, New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services, requires multi-factor authentication for financial institutions, it would be the first financial regulator to do so.\n\nRelated: U.S. Military\u2019s Twitter, YouTube Accounts Apparently Hacked by ISIS\n\nLawsky said he is concerned about an \u201cArmageddon-type cyber event that causes a significant disruption in the financial system for a period of time \u2013 what some have termed a \u2018cyber 9/11.\u2019\u201d He thinks a major event in the financial sector could create panic, destabilizing markets and the economy.\n\nBusinesses have plenty of incentive to improve cybersecurity even without regulation, says Hemanshu Nigam, security consultant and chief security officer at Verie, a start-up that uses facial recognition and your smart phone to verify you are who you say you are.\n\n\u201cCompanies have a huge financial interest in doing the right thing,\u201d he says. Instead of passing laws, government can encourage companies to share information on data breaches and work together to improve security, he believes.\n\nRelated: The Biggest Money Scam on College Campuses\n\nNigam thinks two-factors systems are an improvement \u2014 although he points out they don\u2019t exactly kill off passwords. Passwords are still the first step.\n\nOne day, improvements to facial and eyeball recognition technology will make passwords obsolete. But for now, adding an extra layer of security on top of that traditional password is the direction we\u2019re inevitably heading \u2014 especially if Lawsky gets his way.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "New York\u2019s top financial regulator said Wednesday he wants passwords \u201cdead and buried.\u201d He\u2019s not alone", "title": "Will Regulators Take Your Passwords Away?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/27/Will-Regulators-Take-Your-Passwords-Away", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03172014_Hacking_Password_Computers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/27/Will-Regulators-Take-Your-Passwords-Away", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03172014_Hacking_Password_Computers.jpg", "creator": "@ameystone", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "New York\u2019s top financial regulator said Wednesday he wants passwords \u201cdead and buried.\u201d He\u2019s not alone", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc3f\"", "article_summary": "Now, certain regulators are looking to do away with the system as it\u2019s currently structured.\nWe all know that using your name and password to access websites and e-mails is far from a foolproof security system.\nThe Treasury Department is also carrying the torch.\n\u201cEnhancing the nation\u2019s cybersecurity is a top policy priority for the president and the Treasury Department,\u201d Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin told the Texas Bankers\u2019 Association last December.\nRelated: The Biggest Money Scam on College CampusesNigam thinks two-factors systems are an improvement \u2014 although he points out they don\u2019t exactly kill off passwords."}
