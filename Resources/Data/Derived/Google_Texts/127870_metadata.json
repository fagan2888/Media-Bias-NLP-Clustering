She thought it was a note from me, so she opened it.\n\n\"We are writing to let you know scholastic dues assistance is available with the education amnesty program,\u201d the email said.\n\nBut Patty Woodward has no student debt, and that's just the beginning of the problems with this bogus email.\n\n\u201cThe email was from someone named Christy Lewis. Can I speak with Christy?\u201d I asked when I called the number left in the email.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no Christy in this office,\u201d one person who answered the phone.\n\nEach time I called, a different person answered with a different name for their business.\n\nI got hung up on, put on hold and insulted.\n\nWhen I asked for the location of their company the person on the other end of the call wouldn\u2019t give it to me.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, you seem kind of fishy yourself,\u201d he said.\n\nBut it's clear, according to the Assistant Attorney General Julie Bays, they just wanted Patty to read their urgent message so they could try to sell her something.\n\n\u201cThese crooks are getting very sophisticated. So they might run across a news article or something with two names in it and they\u2019ll use that. We call it social engineering \u2013 to try to convince the person that they\u2019re reaching out to to at least open the email because you might want to call this number and get sold a product you don\u2019t need or want,\u201d Bays said.\n\nScammers can use software to run names and combinations of addresses through different email services and hope that one gets a hit, she added.\n\nThis is one of thousands of reported scams in our state each year.\n\nBays said 70 percent of the efforts by consumer representatives in the AG's office are spent combating phone and email scams. The crimes are rampant, on the rise and the criminals behind them are hard to catch, she said.\n\n\u201cMost likely this is sent from a different state or they\u2019re out of the country so until they\u2019re traced, we\u2019re not going to know where they are and even if we do trace them and find them, a lot of times they\u2019re out of our reach as the State Attorney General,\u201d Bays told News 9.\n\nThe best way to avoid trouble with scams is to just delete the email if you don't recognize it and don't pick up the phone if it's a number you don't know, according to Bays.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Last week, a woman I had just met while working on a story received an email from a Christy Lewis.", "author": "Christy Lewis", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/31708167/scammers-use-news-9-reporters-name-to-target-metro-woman", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10315942_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Last week, a woman I had just met while working on a story received an email from a Christy Lewis.", "title": "Scammers Use News 9 Reporter's Name To Target Metro Woman"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/10315942_G.jpg", "description": "Last week, a woman I had just met while working on a story received an email from a Christy Lewis.", "card": "summary", "title": "Scammers Use News 9 Reporter's Name To Target Metro Woman"}, "wnreadableurl": "scammers-use-news-9-reporters-name-to-target-metro-woman", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2016/04/12", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,Scammer", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS28", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,channel 9,channel nine,news 9,television,this morning,live radar,kwtv,Scammer"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd463a\"", "article_summary": "Scammers can use software to run names and combinations of addresses through different email services and hope that one gets a hit, she added.\nEach time I called, a different person answered with a different name for their business.\nBays said 70 percent of the efforts by consumer representatives in the AG's office are spent combating phone and email scams.\nLast week, a woman I had just met while working on a story received an email from a Christy Lewis.\n\"We are writing to let you know scholastic dues assistance is available with the education amnesty program,\u201d the email said."}
