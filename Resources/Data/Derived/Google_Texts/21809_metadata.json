One area where they should agree is on blocking the growth of the federal government, designed by the Founders to exercise only limited, enumerated powers.\n\nIt will not be simple to reverse the century-long evolution toward the large and unaccountable form of government that we call the administrative state. President Woodrow Wilson established its broad outlines to introduce more expertise and expel politics from lawmaking.\n\nTo Wilson, the lack of political accountability in agencies was a positive feature of the administrative state, not a fault. Today we are left with an ever-growing sprawl of federal agencies, often with unclear and overlapping purposes, and increasingly a law unto themselves.\n\nAccording to the federal government itself, Washington, D.C. does not even have an authoritative list of all of its agencies. Nevertheless, they continue to put out thousands of new regulations a year, culminating in an administrative code that is 80,000 pages long with even more informal guidelines \u2013 far longer than the laws passed by Congress.\n\nAs it impoverished our liberties, presidents needed the help of the other branches of government to extend bureaucracy\u2019s reach. The administrative state operates today with the assent of Congress and the passive acquiescence of the judiciary.\n\nThe administrative state violates the Constitution by transferring the power to legislate from Congress to agencies, which enact rules, enforce them, and then even adjudicate the cases that arise under them. The Constitution actually requires a separation of powers between the three branches, because our Founders rightly feared the consolidation of too much power in one person or entity.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nAs James Madison warned: \u201cThe accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\u201d\n\nRelated Image Expand / Contract Scene at the Signing of the United States Constitution,' a 1940 painting by Howard Chandler Christy (AP)\n\nThe Constitution grants no permission for the transfer of legislative power from Congress to another branch of government. While government agencies must have some discretion when carrying out Congress\u2019s laws, the Framers never intended the president to override Congress\u2019s choices with selective enforcement and unreasonable readings of statutes.\n\nSadly, the courts have stood by while the administrative state has grabbed more and more power. They read out of existence the non-delegation doctrine, which prohibits precisely the transfer of power from Congress to the agencies that has now become so routine. The courts compound their error by deferring to agency decisions, giving unaccountable bureaucrats wide latitude in their decision making.\n\nProof that agencies wield great and unaccountable power can be found in the Internal Revenue Service scandal, which targeted and then delayed applications for tax exempt status from hundreds of right-of-center groups hoping to become involved in the last election cycle.\n\nRedefining and repeatedly delaying the employer mandate under ObamaCare, the Treasury Department exercised authority it did not possess. In settling non-adversarial lawsuits with friendly environmental groups, the Environmental Protection Agency expands its authority, with the imprimatur of the judiciary.\n\nOur new book, \"Liberty\u2019s Nemesis,\" documents the wild growth of this welfare state and offers solutions. With 35 contributors who have worked at the highest levels of all branches of government, it covers an enormous amount of territory.\n\nA determined president acting alone can only temporarily rein in the bureaucracy. He would have to surrender enormous policy-making power back to Congress, exercise great vigilance in policing subordinates, and resist the temptation to solve all of society\u2019s ills. And the gains might last only as long as his presidency.\n\nA lasting solution requires the cooperation of all three government branches. Congress must stop giving up its lawmaking authority to the agencies, and must use its power of the purse to exercise effective oversight. The courts must be serious about blocking the delegation of legislative authority, and must be willing to scrutinize the legality and constitutionality of challenged agency actions. Presidents must faithfully execute the laws, rather than selectively enforce them to help political allies and punish opponents.\n\nIt has taken more than 200 years for the government to grow to its current size, and it will not be reined in without concerted effort.\n\nThe alternative is the further consolidation of power in the administrative state and the continued slide toward Madison\u2019s feared \u201cdefinition of tyranny.\u201d\n\nJohn Yoo is a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley and a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.
