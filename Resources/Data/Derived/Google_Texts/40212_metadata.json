That\u2019s true across the board.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said I want to \u2018thank and excuse\u2019 someone from jury service,\u201d Guilfoyle said. \u201cThat is the language you use in the courtroom. If they want to go back and do social media or dating websites, fine.\u201d She added, \u201cI take the right to vote very seriously. I take the right to serve on a jury very seriously.
