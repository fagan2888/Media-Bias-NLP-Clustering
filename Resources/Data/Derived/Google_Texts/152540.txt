LOS ANGELES (AP) - In 2007, Edie Falco said goodbye to her critically acclaimed series “The Sopranos” in one of the most divisive, talked-about finales on television. As she prepares to bid farewell to her addiction dramedy “Nurse Jackie,” Falco isn’t feeling any pressure to deliver another controversial ending.

“This whole thing about finale episodes, I don’t know. I tend not to get too caught up in it,” Falco said in an interview Tuesday. “In a perfect world it lives up to all that you’ve come to expect in the show. I feel very much that it does.”

“I’m proud of it,” she said of the June 28 finale. “It feels honest.”

Falco stars as Jackie Peyton, an ER nurse addicted to prescription drugs, on the Showtime series (Sunday, 9 p.m. EDT). The final season finds Jackie attempting to piece her career and family back together after a relapse and DUI arrest.

After seven seasons, Falco, 51, is at peace with “Nurse Jackie” ending, but saying goodbye was difficult.

“The final day on set was emotional. It was awful actually,” she said. “You try to be good about it, but there was a lot of crying.”

However, the Emmy-winning actress is thrilled to have more time with her children, Anderson, 10, and Macy, 7.

“First and foremost I’m getting to have a home life,” she said. “I want to be there for the stuff as they’re reading and singing and doing gymnastics and making new friends. It’s all important. It’s all very important stuff for me.”

Falco is sifting through television and film scripts and contemplating a return to theater.

“We’re walking into the unknown and all it is is unknown. It doesn’t mean it’s not going to be great,” she said. “Transitions are always rough, but they’re also what life is made of. So I’ve learned to get better at them and I know that something good happens when you get out of the way.”
