She seemed to have landed a perfect job. She had a voice and following on social media for speaking out about racial injustice and police brutality and was active in her community.\n\nEven after one video surfaced showing the 28-year-old talking in March about depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, those who knew her said she would not have killed herself inside a Texas jail cell \u2014 not even over the confrontational traffic stop that led to her arrest, which mirrored the ones she railed against online.\n\n\u201cShe was in good spirits. She was looking forward to what was next,\u201d said friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley, 57, adding that he was unaware of any struggles with depression. \u201cShe was making plans for the future, so there\u2019s no way she was in a suicidal state.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, about 100 protesters marched from the Waller County jail \u2014 where authorities say Bland hanged herself with a plastic bag on Monday \u2014 to the courthouse in Hempstead.\n\nBland\u2019s death comes amid increased national scrutiny of police after a series of high-profile cases in which blacks have been killed by officers. Friends and family have questioned authorities\u2019 account of how she died.\n\nBland, known in her family as Sandy B, grew up in the Chicago suburb of Naperville, the fourth of five sisters. She was active in her family\u2019s church and was the only one of her sisters to go to college out of state. She studied at the College of Agriculture at Prairie View A&M University, a historically black school 40 miles northwest of Houston.\n\nDuring her freshman year, she met Mosley, who recruited her for a job as a 4-H camp counselor. For three summers, Bland shepherded kids between horseback riding, fishing, campfires and other activities at the camp in Huntsville, Texas.\n\nShe was a member of the Sigma Gamma Rho sorority, played trombone in the marching band and volunteered with a senior citizens advocacy organization that Mosley runs, he said.\n\nShe also witnessed racial hostility and injustices against blacks in Waller County, Mosley said, describing the area as \u201cvery segregated.\u201d\n\nSometime after graduating in 2009, Bland returned to Illinois to be closer to family, but bounced between temp jobs.\n\nIn January, Bland began posting cellphone videos to her Facebook page under the title \u201cSandy Speaks\u201d in which she groused about everything from inattentive parents and police mistreatment of blacks to what she called the \u201cgeneration of heads down\u201d \u2014 all of us with our heads buried in our smartphones.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Friend: Sandra Bland \u2018in good spirits\u2019 before jail death", "title": "Friend: Sandra Bland \u2018in good spirits\u2019 before jail death", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Friend: Sandra Bland \u2018in good spirits\u2019 before jail death", "title": "Friend: Sandra Bland \u2018in good spirits\u2019 before jail death", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/18/friend_sandra_bland_in_good_spirits_before_jail_death/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/woman-dead-in-jail-.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Friend: Sandra Bland \u2018in good spirits\u2019 before jail death", "title": "Friend: Sandra Bland \u2018in good spirits\u2019 before jail death", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/woman-dead-in-jail-.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jason Keyser and Michael Graczyk", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Bland, known in her family as Sandy B, grew up in the Chicago suburb of Naperville, the fourth of five sisters.\nFor three summers, Bland shepherded kids between horseback riding, fishing, campfires and other activities at the camp in Huntsville, Texas.\nBland\u2019s death comes amid increased national scrutiny of police after a series of high-profile cases in which blacks have been killed by officers.\nShe was looking forward to what was next,\u201d said friend and mentor LaVaughn Mosley, 57, adding that he was unaware of any struggles with depression.\nShe had a voice and following on social media for speaking out about racial injustice and police brutality and was active in her community."}
