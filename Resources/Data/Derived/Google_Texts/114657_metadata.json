So how did Monday\u2019s late night shows tackle Diane Sawyer\u2018s groundbreaking interview with Bruce Jenner, who told the world for the first time that he is a transgender woman? The uniformly male hosts each took slightly different approaches, with some discussing the story at length and others choosing to ignore it altogether. Below is a look at how late night tackled the sometimes perilous terrain of Jenner\u2019s transition.\n\nThe easiest way in comedically appeared to be Jenner\u2019s surprising admission that he is a Republican. \u201cEveryone tuned in to watch Jenner make a pretty big announcement,\u201d Jimmy Fallon said at the top of his monologue, before playing that clip from the interview. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Bruce Jenner declared he is a woman and a Republican,\u201d Fallon said, \u201cin other words, the GOP finally found something that might be able to beat Hillary.\u201d\n\nWatch video below, via NBC:\n\n\u201cIn last week\u2019s interview, Bruce Jenner said he is a woman who is transitioning his body from male to female and he\u2019s also a conservative Republican,\u201d Conan O\u2019Brien said on his show, using a similar approach to Fallon. \u201cBruce said he looks forward to bashing Obamacare as soon as he finishes using it.\u201d\n\nWatch video below, via TBS:\n\nAs ABC\u2019s resident late night host, Jimmy Kimmel perhaps unsurprisingly spent more time than his network competition discussing the ABC News interview. The host also joked about Jenner\u2019s conservative comments, especially his suggestion that Republican leaders like John Boehner and Mitch McConnell would help advocate for the transgender rights.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah, of course they will,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cThey are probably having the buttons printed up as we speak, billboards, banners, maybe some foam fingers they sell at games. They are not booing, they are saying \u2018Bruce.'\u201d\n\nUnlike Fallon and O\u2019Brien, Kimmel did play things a little less safe by calling Jenner \u201cour next Bachelorette\u201d and revealing that he is changing his name to Diane Sawyer. \u201cIt turns out after all these years, instead of the Kardashians, we should have been keeping up with him,\u201d he concluded.\n\nWatch video below, via ABC:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, CBS\u2019 David Letterman, NBC\u2019s Seth Meyers and The Daily Show\u2019s Jon Stewart opted to ignore the Jenner story completely. But going in the other direction, Larry Wilmore dedicated his entire half hour to it.\n\nThe Nightly Show was a bit hit and miss but its attempt to tackle the transgender issue so comprehensively was commendable. After a somewhat awkward segment that featured Colin Quinn as Pinocchio \u2014 who transitioned from a puppet to a real boy, get it? \u2014 Wilmore welcomed a transgender man and woman to his panel where they discussed the issues facing that community with a tenuous balance of humor and sincerity.\n\nThings threaten to go off the rails when Wilmore started throwing the word \u201ctranny\u201d around, but it was undoubtedly a learning experience for him and his audience.\n\nWatch the panel segment below, via Comedy Central:\n\nFinally, there was one late night host who decided to talk about the Jenner story without making any jokes whatsoever: James Corden. The Late Late Show host turned serious for a minute, saying, \u201cHonestly, I thought it was genuinely one of the most incredible pieces of television I\u2019ve seen in years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI truly hope that after this weekend\u2019s interview that this world that we live in is a better, more understanding, more educated place,\u201d he added, drawing cheers from his audience. \u201cWe thank you Bruce, we really do, for sharing so openly and so honestly.\u201d\n\nWatch video below, via CBS:\n\n[Photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\n>> Follow Matt Wilstein (@TheMattWilstein) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "It was the most-talked-about pop culture moment of the week.
