His passenger, 19-year-old Jose Oviedo Juarez, died after he was ejected from the truck.\n\nBall said she met Mota, the owner of Leo\u2019s Lawn Service, about seven years ago when he was in her neighborhood mowing lawns. It wasn\u2019t long before she was introducing him to other neighbors.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been taking care of our lawn for years,\u201d she said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t even have to ask for things to be done, he knew exactly what we wanted. He just really cared about all his customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just developed a friendship,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Ball said she didn\u2019t know Mota had been critically injured in the tornado until more than a week after the storm.\n\n\u201cWe heard the lawn mowers, and we thought, \u2018Oh, Leo is here mowing,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cWe got a knock, and it was his nephew \u2026 and he told us what had happened and that he came to help his aunt and to do some of the lawns.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the family said online that Mota \u201cpassed away peacefully\u201d at Medical Center of Plano after he was taken off life support Friday night.\n\nHis wife, Maria, and other relatives were at his side when he died.\n\n\u201cThat was a painful and hard decision for Maria to make,\u201d wrote the spokeswoman, Teresa Wisdom. \u201cLeo did not suffer, the hospital cared and treated him with compassion and dignity and extended that to the family as well.\u201d\n\nMota\u2019s family and friends could not be reached for comment, but dozens of people posted condolences and shared memories online.\n\n\u201cHe was just really a special person,\u201d Ball said. \u201cHe worked day and night, and when I heard he was leaving Rockwall [that night] \u2026 it didn\u2019t surprise me. That\u2019s just how he was, he worked late and every day of the week.\u201d\n\nShe said all that work was for his family.\n\n\u201cHe adored his children,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was so proud of his family and he loved his kids, and that\u2019s what we admired most. He was just a family man.\u201d\n\nShe said the flowers in front of her home were beautiful reminders of her friend.\n\n\u201cI went out there today and just looked at the flowers,\u201d she said.\n\nFor more information on how to help the Mota family click here.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE2LzAxL3JlcG9ydHMtbWFuLWluanVyZWQtaW4tZ2FybGFuZC10b3JuYWRvLWhhcy1kaWVkLWJyaW5naW5nLXN0b3Jtcy1kZWF0aC10b2xsLXRvLTEyLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Julie Fancher", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Dana Hart-Ball came home to her Rockwall home one day last month and found flowers planted all the way up her sidewalk.
