I thought we came out in the second half and played with more energy and effort, but we weren\u2019t playing with enough energy there in the first half. The second half, we did.\u201d\n\nFrequently running the read option, Aggies quarterback Kent Myers \u2014 the backup taking over for the injured Chuckie Keeton \u2014 rushed for 191 yards on 16 carries, and that included a 26-yard TD run that broke a 10-10 tie with 56 seconds left in the first half.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to give Utah State credit,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cThey did a nice job coming off the bye week, doing some different things offensively, getting their quarterback free. He played an outstanding game for them.\u201d\n\nSaid CSU linebacker Kiel Robinson: \u201cWe should have been able to stop them. We had a few missed assignments and that was it. \u2026We have to have our communication down much better and know our assignments; we can\u2019t just lose contain. We have to know who has the quarterback, who has the pitch man, who has the zone read, all that stuff.\u201d\n\nPending a review of video, Bobo defended his quarterback, Nick Stevens, who was harried much of the night and finished 21-of-46 for 252 yards and one touchdown.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many sacks we gave up, but there\u2019s too much pressure on the quarterback,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cWe had open guys several times (and) we couldn\u2019t get our feet set to throw a good ball. It\u2019s disappointing, I\u2019m not real happy about the performance, but at the end of the day, we have to go back to work on Monday because we have one of the top teams in the country coming into town. \u2026 We have to go back to the drawing board and figure out a better way to protect him.\u201d\n\nThe Rams face No. 25 Boise State (4-1) on Saturday, then Air Force Oct. 17, both at home. So CSU will have chances to avenge its only conference losses of a year ago, and Stevens said the Rams\u2019 confidence hasn\u2019t been shaken.\n\n\u201cThis is a new season and we can\u2019t think about we did last year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re 0-1 in conference, and half the teams are going to be 0-1 in conference after this week, so I think we should focus on the rest of the season and not lose hope, and I think we\u2019re going to be all right.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei\n\nEye on \u2026The Broncos\n\nBoise State at Colorado State, 5 p.m. Saturday, CBSSN\n\nFor the record: No. 25 Boise State is 4-1 and Colorado State is 2-3.\n\nStreaking: The Broncos have won three straight, averaging 54 points against Idaho State, Virginia and Hawaii. And they shut out ISU and Hawaii.\n\nWho\u2019s hot: BSU quarterback Brett Rypien has thrown for 592 yards in his two starts since Ryan Finley was injured.\n\nWho\u2019s not: The Rams have never beaten the Broncos, losing all four annual meetings since 2011.\n\nKey stat: Rypien has completed 73.9 percent of his passes.\n\nFYI: Yes, Rypien is the nephew of former Washington State and NFL quarterback Mark Rypien.\n\nTerry Frei, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "After losing stars from 2014, CSU Rams see stars after Utah St.", "title": "After losing stars from 2014, CSU Rams see stars after Utah St.", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/04/after-losing-stars-from-2014-csu-rams-see-stars-after-utah-st/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151004_043613_nick-stevens.jpg", "height": 548}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151004_043613_nick-stevens.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-04T17:04:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T04:37:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI don\u2019t know how many sacks we gave up, but there\u2019s too much pressure on the quarterback,\u201d Bobo said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to give Utah State credit,\u201d Bobo said.\nWho\u2019s not: The Rams have never beaten the Broncos, losing all four annual meetings since 2011.\nSo CSU will have chances to avenge its only conference losses of a year ago, and Stevens said the Rams\u2019 confidence hasn\u2019t been shaken.\n\u2026 We have to go back to the drawing board and figure out a better way to protect him.\u201dThe Rams face No."}
