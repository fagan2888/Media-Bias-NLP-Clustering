Also, I just answered your question. You\u2019re trying to bring me into a trap maybe. It\u2019s a good try.\u201d\n\nIf it was a trap, it was a neutral-zone trap. Roy\u2019s answer was civil, almost good-natured give-and-take.\n\nBut this is what he said a little earlier: \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves \u2014 E.J., Tyson, they have to carry our defense. Nathan, Dutchy, Landy, they have to carry the offense. They are the heart of this team. These are the guys that are going to decide how far this team\u2019s going to go. These are the guys, with Varly obviously, who are going to decide whether we make the playoffs or not. They\u2019re the leaders of this team.\n\n\u201cSome are talking in the room, some it\u2019s more on the ice, but they are the leaders of this team and they\u2019re the ones who have to take charge and turn this thing around.\u201d\n\nOf course, his remarks also were notable because of those players he didn\u2019t mention, since the Avalanche hasn\u2019t been getting scoring beyond its high-profile young forwards. So it\u2019s up to them, so to speak, especially if Jarome Iginla and Alex Tanguay continue to struggle and the lines beyond those centered by MacKinnon and Carl Soderberg don\u2019t pitch in offensively.\n\nThe Avalanche is 0-2-1 on the homestand that began after the all-star break and concludes Tuesday against Vancouver.\n\nThe upside for Colorado is that is has managed to remain in a Western Conference wild-card playoff spot during the latest slide.\n\n\u201cWe had a chance, three games at home coming back, to start where we left off,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWe should be disappointed right now. We cannot be happy about the way we\u2019ve been playing the last three games. Yeah, we scored the first goal (against Winnipeg), but after that, they took the play away from us.\u201d\n\nMikhail Grigorenko, who had been installed on the top line with Duchene and MacKinnon at even strength, gave the Avalanche a 1-0 lead with a power-play goal and Duchene got his 24th of the season to close Colorado within 3-2 in the second.\n\nBut even with the Jets playing for the second time in 26 hours, the Central Division\u2019s cellar-dwellers held on.\n\nAfter Jack Skille\u2019s concussion \u2014 suffered against Dallas on Thursday \u2014 the Avalanche was down to 12 available forwards, so all played against the Jets. Colorado didn\u2019t practice Sunday, and it seems likely the team will recall a forward from San Antonio in advance of the Tuesday game against the Canucks.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Avalanche\u2019s loss to Jets fuels Patrick Roy\u2019s push of players", "title": "Avalanche\u2019s loss to Jets fuels Patrick Roy\u2019s push of players", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/07/avalanches-loss-to-jets-fuels-patrick-roys-push-of-players/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160207__BN20160208_B1_BNSP08HKNAVSp1.jpg", "height": 496}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160207__BN20160208_B1_BNSP08HKNAVSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-07T19:32:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:25:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1076\"", "article_summary": "After the Avalanche\u2019s 4-2 loss Saturday night to the bedraggled Winnipeg Jets, Colorado coach Patrick Roy seemed to be calling out his most prominent players.\nAfter Jack Skille\u2019s concussion \u2014 suffered against Dallas on Thursday \u2014 the Avalanche was down to 12 available forwards, so all played against the Jets.\nBut even with the Jets playing for the second time in 26 hours, the Central Division\u2019s cellar-dwellers held on.\nThese are the guys, with Varly obviously, who are going to decide whether we make the playoffs or not.\nBut this is what he said a little earlier: \u201cLet\u2019s not kid ourselves \u2014 E.J., Tyson, they have to carry our defense."}
