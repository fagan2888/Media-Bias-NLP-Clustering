On CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) addressed Hillary Clinton’s past claim that he is her favorite Republican, saying he respects the former secretary of State and senator despite his many disagreements with her in the past.

He dodged the question of whether or not Hillary is his “favorite Democrat,” instead joking, “I hope this program is blacked out in Arizona.”

McCain then described his effort to reach across party lines and work with Democrats on certain issues to get things done in Washington.

“I think it’s my job to work with every president if she is — regrettably — if she attains the presidency,” he detailed. “I worked with her in the Senate. I just worked with Senator Sanders on a Veterans Affairs bill. We’ve got to fix the VA. How do you do that? You’ve got to reach across the aisle and work together on certain issues and I’m not only not embarrassed about that, I’m proud of it.”
