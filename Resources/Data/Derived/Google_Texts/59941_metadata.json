The school was facing millions in fines that would have taken effect this weekend without the injunction.\n\nThe Obama administration has been struggling with setback after setback on its contraceptive mandate. A series of unfavorable court decisions has forced the administration to change its formulation for the mandate, a centerpiece of the health-care law, several times in a row. According to the conservative Becket Fund, which serves as legal counsel in a number of lawsuits against the mandate including Ave Maria\u2019s, that\u2019s the eighth revision to the mandate so far.\n\nThe Supreme Court itself ruled this past summer the mandate itself violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in the case of closely held companies. Shortly after, the Court granted an injunction to Wheaton College, a Christian institution, which is battling the mandate\u2019s exemption.

After outcry against that strict requirement, the administration created an exemption for some religious non-profits that forced them to notify their insurance company third-party administrator of their objection \u2014 and then the insurer would be forced to cover the cost of the free contraception.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s injunction in Wheaton\u2019s case shook the administration into fearing that even their exemption could be struck down on the grounds of religious freedom. So they came up with another formulation with yet another bureaucratic layer \u2014 instead of notifying insurers, now employers have to notify HHS that they object to providing the 20 types of contraception and HHS will be the ones to tell insurers that they have to pay up.

We congratulate Ave Maria for its courage, even under the threat of crippling fines.\u201d\n\nFollow Sarah on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Sarah Hurtubise", "description": "Months of bad news for Obamacare's contraception requirement", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Another Christian university has won an injunction against the Obama administration's birth control mandate and its ever-changing exemptions for it.\u00a0    Ave Maria School of Law, a Catholic law school", "title": "Another Christian College Wins Injunction Over Birth Control Mandate", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/10/28/another-christian-college-wins-injunction-over-birth-control-mandate/", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Birth-Control-e1385492944217.jpg", "height": 270}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Months of bad news for Obamacare's contraception requirement", "title": "Another Christian College Wins Injunction Over Birth Control Mandate Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2014/10/28/another-christian-college-wins-injunction-over-birth-control-mandate/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Birth-Control-e1385492944217.jpg"}, "creator": "@@SarahMHurtubise", "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-10-28 15:48:18", "sailthru.title": "Another Christian College Wins Injunction Over Birth Control Mandate", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,sarah-hurtubise", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "obamacare", "sailthru.description": "Another Christian university has won an injunction against the Obama administration's birth control mandate and its ever-changing exemptions for it.\u00a0    Ave Maria School of Law, a Catholic law school", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Birth-Control-e1385492944217.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce40f\"", "article_summary": "4363016Another Christian university has won an injunction against the Obama administration\u2019s birth control mandate and its ever-changing exemptions for it.\n(RELATED: Supreme Court Grants Christian College Injunction Over Obamacare Religious Exemption)The mandate requires employers to provide 20 types of contraception at no cost to employees.\n(RELATED: Obama Admin Backs Off Birth Control Mandate After Supreme Court Smackdown)Ave Maria won\u2019t have to provide birth control coverage or notify a third-party administrator and won\u2019t be fined until an appeal in a similar lawsuit, from Christian television network EWTN, concludes.\nShortly after, the Court granted an injunction to Wheaton College, a Christian institution, which is battling the mandate\u2019s exemption.\nThe Supreme Court itself ruled this past summer the mandate itself violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act in the case of closely held companies."}
