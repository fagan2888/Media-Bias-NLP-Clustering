But Johnson also noted the popularity of the program, indicating he may issue a decision soon.\n\nMore than 4,000 families, including that of Henderson mother Aimee Hairr, have applied for early enrollment in the new program that offers parents about $5,000 in state funding to spend on private school tuition and other education services if they pull their students out of public school.\n\n\u201cI definitely think a decision needs to be made soon,\u201d said Hairr, who attended the Thursday hearing.\n\nShe hopes to create an education savings account for each of her children, whom Hairr said struggle to succeed in the Clark County School District.\n\n\u201cThe longer this takes, the more frustration we feel as parents,\u201d she added. \u201cIt yo-yos our children back and forth, so we need an answer.\u201d\n\nIn August, the American Civil Liberties Union and its Nevada chapter sued to stop the implementation of Senate Bill 302.\n\nThat legislation, which Gov. Brian Sandoval signed in June, allows the creation of education savings accounts for all public and charter school students regardless of income and background. With the first payments set for February, SB 302 allows families to use their account to pay for private school tuition, homeschooling, tutoring, transportation and much more.\n\nThe ACLU, however, argues the program violates a provision in the Nevada Constitution that prohibits the state from using public funds of any kind for a sectarian purpose.\n\nSpecifically, the civil rights advocacy group claims SB 302 cannot allow taxpayer money to cover tuition at religiously affiliated schools, which make up the vast majority of private schools in Nevada.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simply not something the (constitution) allows the state to fund,\u201d argued Richard Katskee, legal director of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, which joined the ACLU in its lawsuit.\n\nKatskee also discounted the state\u2019s claim that SB 302 creates a middleman \u2014 namely, parents \u2014 who privately decide how to use the money funneled into an education savings account.\n\nOnly a parent can choose to spend that money at a religious school, not the government, state Solicitor General Lawrence Van Dyke told Johnson.\n\nJohnson asked Katskee to explain how that private choice differed from public employees spending their government-paid wages for tuition at a religious school or Medicaid recipients who seek treatment at a Catholic hospital.\n\n\u201cIf I go to a doctor (who works) for a Catholic hospital to have my gallbladder removed, what I\u2019m paying for is to get my gallbladder removed,\u201d not a sectarian purpose, Katsee said.\n\nThe judge interrupted, noting that a non-sectarian medical procedure subsidized with state funds eventually helps the Catholic hospital survive and afford other sectarian purposes. Johnson questioned Katskee's argument that the hospital example differed from a private school using public money on mostly non-sectarian curriculum.\n\nFor the state, Van Dyke spent considerable time trying to convince Johnson to dismiss the ACLU\u2019s lawsuit because it had no grounds to sue before the actual implementation of SB 302 next year.\n\nThe ACLU, citing another provision in the state constitution, claims the education savings accounts will drain money from public schools and leave them with a higher share of struggling students who cost more to educate.\n\n\u201cIf their parade of horrible were to come to pass, they can bring a (complaint),\u201d Van Dyke said.\n\nJohnson also heard arguments from Tim Keller, legal director of the Institute for Justice, which represents a group of parents intervening in the case as defenders of SB 302.\n\nAt one point, the judge questioned why the legislation lacked any guidance on how to ensure children actually receive a quality education through the program.\n\n\"No offense, but I'm not sure the treasurer is the best person to figure out whether or not educational goals are being met,\" he said, referring to the state agency in charge of implementing SB 302.\n\nKeller agreed.\n\n\"The treasurer is not the best person,\" he said. \"The best person are the parents.\"\n\nContact Neal Morton at nmorton@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0279.
