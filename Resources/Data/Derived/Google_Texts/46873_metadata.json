And during the sixty days every two years when the legislature was in session, governors dictated to the General Assembly what issues they would take up.\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Former C-J executive editor David Hawpe and reporter Joe Gerth remember former Sen. Wendell Ford who recently passed away.\n\nWhen the legislature wasn't in session, the governors had nearly unfettered power to rule by executive order and controlled a statewide patronage system that allowed them to further exert control over the political process.\n\nAs governor, Ford wielded his power to reorganize the government putting in place a framework that still largely exists, he removed the sales tax on groceries, pushed for a coal severance levy to make the coal barons share the tax burden. He increased the gas tax to build new and better roads in the state.\n\nHe increased spending on education, particularly at the University of Louisville which had recently been brought into the state system. He built buildings and parks. And he called the state's legislature into special session to pass the Equal Rights Amendment in 1972.\n\nQuite a list of accomplishments in three years.\n\nBut at the time, the state constitution prohibited governors from succeeding themselves and so in 1972, Ford left the Governor's Mansion a year early and headed to Washington, though he said he would have rather have stayed in Frankfort for a second term had the law allowed it.\n\nAs a senator, in many ways, he acted more like a governor, eschewing national political issues and focusing intently on the state's needs. When activist Ralph Nader and others criticized him, Ford was not apologetic.\n\n\"If they want to criticize me, that's fine,\" the Associated Press reported. \"But Kentucky is beautiful women, fast horses, bourbon whiskey, cigarettes and coal. I represent Kentucky and that's what I represent.\"\n\nRest in peace, Governor.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1BXlkev", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "\"If they want to criticize me, that's fine,\" the Associated Press reported Wendell Ford said. \"But Kentucky is beautiful women, fast horses, bourbon whiskey, cigarettes and coal.
