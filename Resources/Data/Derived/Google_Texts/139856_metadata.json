Dr. Peter J. Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, told the AP that it\u2019s likely the children received double the vaccine dosage they\u2019d ordinarily receive, and reiterated the low risk of danger. As of Saturday, there have been no reported adverse effects or hospitalizations as a result of the shots.\n\nTo those who have criticized the practice of detaining immigrant families within these facilities, however, this latest incident marks only the latest example of reckless and inappropriate behavior by staff.\n\n\"Volunteer attorneys at Dilley, as well as those at similar detention centers in Karnes, TX, Berks, PA and the previous facility in Artesia, NM, have long noted disturbing patterns of what appears to be inadequate health care for the women and children,\" said Crystal Williams, Executive Director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association in a statement. \"Children have been forced to sleep with the lights on, are subject to intrusive checks regularly throughout the night, and have been dragged from their beds at 4:00 am to be given shots while their mothers must stand helplessly by without being told what is going on or being allowed a say in the matter.\"\n\nHepatitis A, though not as notorious or dangerous as its alphabetic brethren, can cause nausea, vomiting, and jaundice, among other symptoms. While most who catch it will only briefly suffer, if at all, in rare cases, the disease can take months to resolve. It is most often spread through food or water contaminated with infected fecal matter. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for all children at the age of one.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "immigrant children, hepatitis a vaccine", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Texas detention center accidentally gave 250 children an adult version of the Hepatitis A vaccine last week.", "title": "Adult Hep A Vaccine Given To 250 Immigrant Children at Texas Detention Center", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/immigrant-detention-center-accidentally-injects-250-kids-adult-hepatitis-vaccine-no-341296", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/05/hepatitis.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Texas detention center accidentally gave 250 children an adult version of the Hepatitis A vaccine last week.", "title": "Adult Hep A Vaccine Given To 250 Immigrant Children at Texas Detention Center", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/immigrant-detention-center-accidentally-injects-250-kids-adult-hepatitis-vaccine-no-341296", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/05/hepatitis.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/07/05/hepatitis.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-07-05T23:50:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-05T23:53:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Texas detention center accidentally gave 250 children an adult version of the Hepatitis A vaccine last week."}, "article_summary": "According to the Centers for Disease Control, the Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for all children at the age of one.\nIt appears that 250 immigrant children held at a Texas detention facility were given a full adult-sized dose of the Hepatitis A vaccine last week, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials.\nHepatitis A, though not as notorious or dangerous as its alphabetic brethren, can cause nausea, vomiting, and jaundice, among other symptoms.\nThe children had been staying with their mothers, who have been briefed about the incident.\nAs of Saturday, there have been no reported adverse effects or hospitalizations as a result of the shots."}
