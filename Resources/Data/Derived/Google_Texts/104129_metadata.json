In 1995, the women sued then-Commissioner Tommy Olmstead of the Georgia Department of Human Resources under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the case reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled in their favor in June 1999.\n\nIn what became known as the Olmstead decision, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the majority, said states would be required to place those patients in community settings when those treating them deemed it appropriate, but added two important caveats \u2013 that such a transfer \u201cis not opposed by the affected individual, and the placement can be reasonably accommodated, taking into account the resources available to the State and the needs\u201d of other patients, according to the opinion.\n\nHowever, the justices also noted \u201cthat nothing in the ADA or its implementing regulations condones termination of institutional settings for persons unable to handle or benefit from community settings. Nor is there any federal requirement that community-based treatment be imposed on patients who do not desire it.\u201d\n\nBy its own admission, in 2009 the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division \u201claunched an aggressive effort to enforce\u201d Olmstead in individual state actions. Georgia, which had earlier come under scrutiny over conditions in its state hospitals, entered into a settlement agreement with the department and agreed to begin transitioning patients from state facilities into community care.\n\nFor those with developmental disabilities, the state agreed to transfer 150 patients a year and to move the last of them by July 1. That part of the settlement was halted in 2013 after a number of patient deaths and a finding that the state was not meeting some patient care standards for those in community care.\n\nTransfers to community care recently resumed for patients in the Gracewood wing at East Central Regional Hospital. Such transfers were stopped in 2013 after deaths and care concerns. - FILE/STAFF\n\n\n\nLosing arguments\n\nThe transfers were recently restarted in the Augusta region, with patients from the Grace\u00adwood wing of East Central Re\u00adgio\u00adnal Hospital, and so far two have been moved this year under what is being called the Pio\u00adneer Pilot Project.\n\nABOUT THE RULING THE DECISION: The majority of states would be required to place patients with developmental disabilities in community settings when it was appropriate, the patient did not object and the move can be reasonably accommodated. IN GEORGIA: The state agreed to transfer 150 patients a year and to move the last of them by July 1. The transfers were halted in 2013 after patient deaths and a finding that the state was not meeting some patient care standards.\n\nBut Georgia is hardly alone. The Justice Department is enforcing, pursuing action or filing briefs in support of ADA lawsuits in 23 states and has settlement agreements with 10 states and Puerto Rico.\n\nTo those such as Tamie Hopp of the advocacy group VOR, it is telling that the division has devoted a Web page to its actions with the headline \u201cOlmstead: Com\u00admunity Integration for Every\u00adone.\u201d\n\nBut the department has not always won its enforcement cases.\n\nIn 2009, it sued the state of Arkansas and Arkansas officials, alleging there were violations of the ADA and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act at the state\u2019s Con\u00adway Human Development Center in not moving patients to community settings.\n\nIn a June 2011 ruling, U.S. District Judge J. Leon Holmes clearly didn\u2019t buy that argument. His 85-page ruling begins: \u201cMost lawsuits are brought by persons who believe that their rights have been violated. Not this one.\u201d\n\nHolmes noted that any parent or guardian who asked for community placement had received it and that there was near-universal opposition among the rest to moving their family members.\n\n\u201cThus, the United States is in the odd position of asserting that certain persons\u2019 rights have been and are being violated while those persons \u2013\n\nthrough their parents and guardians \u2013 disagree,\u201d the judge wrote.\n\nHopp said that is exactly what parents at Gracewood are expressing.\n\nIt appears you don't have a PDF plugin for this browser.

Long-term studies of patients in California show this is not an aberration.\n\nBecause of California law, people with developmental disabilities had a right to choose and receive community care, and between 1993 and 1996 more than 2,000 adults and children transferred into the community, according to a series of studies by Drs. Robert Shavelle and David Strauss and colleagues.\n\nIt appears you don't have a PDF plugin for this browser. No biggie... you can click here to download the PDF file. Read the independent report from September 2014 regarding the status of the State of Georgia's compliance with United States v. Georgia.\n\n\n\nCrunching the numbers\n\nIn studying more than 1,800 of them, they found a 51 percent higher mortality rate than would be expected compared with comparable patients in institutions.\n\nLater analysis of this same group over a longer period of time found a 47 percent higher than expected death rate, and in their 2005 paper the authors conclude that \u201cthe cost savings of deinstitutionalization and social value of integration must be balanced against this increased risk.\u201d\n\nHowever, VOR argues that there isn\u2019t any cost savings to the state.\n\nINTERACTIVE VIEW A MAP AND DATABASE of the service regions for disabled residents in Georgia and the hospitals that have not yet been closed by the state.\n\nWhile at first glance it appears community care is much cheaper than that in an institution, this approach doesn\u2019t take into consideration a number of factors, such as level of care and professional services provided and how much care the patients need, particularly because those still in institutions tend to be older and require more services than those in community care, according to a 2003 literature review in the journal Mental Retardation, which has since been renamed Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.\n\nThe biggest difference seems to be staffing, the authors concluded.\n\n\u201cThe modest differences reported for community services are predominantly the result of lower staffing costs in privately operated community settings compared to state-operated settings,\u201d they wrote. And as state institutions close \u2013 as they have in Georgia \u2013 and those patients are shifted into the community, \u201cit is likely that any initial cost benefits claimed for community settings will be difficult to sustain as individuals with more complex needs are served in these settings,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nA sample of the heavily-redacted documents provided by the state in response to Open Records Act requests.\n\n\n\nHow we did it\n\nThe Augusta Chronicle began looking into patients of the Georgia Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities who died while in community care after learning of the death of 12-year-old Christen Gordon in August 2013.\n\nThe investigation began in earnest after the project was selected in 2014 for a National Health Journalism Fellowship, a program at the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.\n\nThe Chronicle used several Open Records Act requests to obtain investigative files on some of the 82 unexplained deaths in 2013 among the department\u2019s patients in community care, which was then focused on just those with developmental disabilities.\n\nThe Chronicle received investigative files on 28 patients, but they were heavily redacted and did not contain names or other identifying information. The newspaper then obtained a database of all deaths in Georgia in 2013 \u2013 more than 76,000 \u2013 and after extensive cleaning of those records was able to use it to identify 24 of those patients. Using other databases, The Chronicle identified family members for a majority of those patients. Many were uninterested in pursuing an investigation into the deaths and some didn\u2019t return e-mails or phone calls.\n\nThe Chronicle used other Open Records Act requests to discover that nearly 1,000 patients had died in community care in the past two years and that a majority of the unexpected deaths are among patients with developmental disabilities.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Health, Metro, Latest News, Tom Corwin", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "What began as two Georgia mental health patients seeking community care has become a national crusade by the U.S. Department of Justice to move patients out of state facilities and into community care, with what some say are unintended consequences.", "title": "Supreme Court ruling fuels push for community care", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/latest-news/2015-03-21/supreme-court-ruling-fuels-push-community-care", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/14224256.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1df2\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe modest differences reported for community services are predominantly the result of lower staffing costs in privately operated community settings compared to state-operated settings,\u201d they wrote.\nTransfers to community care recently resumed for patients in the Gracewood wing at East Central Regional Hospital.\nOf the 535 patients who died in 2013 in Georgia, 500 were receiving care in the community; last year, 498 of the 526 who died were receiving community care.\nCombined, the death rate would be 16 times higher in community care than in state facilities.\nGeorgia patients Lois Curtis and Elaine Wilson were receiving services at a state hospital and wanted to transition to community care, but the state refused to let them."}
