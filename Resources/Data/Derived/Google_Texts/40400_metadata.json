Photo courtesy of Shutterstock\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea on Thursday confirmed that a man who died a day earlier had been infected with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the third fatality in a virus outbreak that has fueled growing alarm in the country.\n\nThe 82-year old South Korean, in hospital with asthma and bacterial pneumonia, had shared a room with others infected with MERS and died on Wednesday night, the health ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe victim became the 36th confirmed MERS infection in South Korea, which has the most cases outside the Middle East.\n\nMore than 1,100 schools were closed in South Korea on Thursday, while North Korea called for border checks.\n\nSouth Korean President Park Geun-hye has demanded that everything be done to halt the outbreak, which began two weeks ago, brought into the country by a South Korean man returning from a business trip to the Middle East.\n\nMERS first appeared in 2012 in the Middle East, where most of the 442 fatalities have been.\n\nAbout 1,600 people have been quarantined in South Korea, most of them at home but some in medical institutions, a health ministry official said.\n\nSoldiers have been confined to base in areas near hospitals where outbreaks have occurred, while parents from those areas may not visit children in the armed forces, a defense ministry official said.\n\nAmong the five other new South Korean cases reported on Thursday were two health workers who treated infected patients.\n\n\"We are in a war,\" said an official earlier on Thursday at a health center in Seoul's wealthy Gangnam district, where panic spread when medical workers in protection suits were spotted near a hotel.\n\nThe official said a Middle Eastern guest at the hotel fell ill and was later quarantined in hospital.\n\nMERS is caused by a coronavirus from the same family as that which caused SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which emerged in 2002-2003 and killed around 800 people worldwide.\n\nMERS has a much higher death rate, of 38 percent, according to the World Health Organisation, but also spreads far less swiftly than SARS from person to person, making it less of a threat for now.\n\nNERVOUS NEIGHBORS\n\nNorth Korea had asked the South to provide heat-detecting cameras to monitor temperatures of South Korean workers traveling to the inter-Korean Kaesong Industrial Complex, just north of the border, a South Korean government official said.\n\nSouth Korea lent North Korea three cameras to use at the complex during the recent scare over Ebola, the official said.\n\nThe WHO has not recommended travel curbs, but about 7,000 people from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan had canceled trips to South Korea as of June 2, a spokesman for the Korea Tourism Organisation said.\n\nJapan said it was looking into possible quarantine measures for people arriving from South Korea.\n\nChina last week reported its first case, that of a South Korean man who tested positive after breaking a voluntary house quarantine and traveling to Hong Kong and on to mainland China.\n\nAuthorities have been criticized for being slow to respond to the initial spread of MERS.\n\nIt took several days for the 68-year-old man returning from the Middle East to be diagnosed, during which time he infected people at health facilities where he had sought treatment.\n\nAll of South Korea's cases have been traced to the man who visited Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the countries with the most MERS cases.\n\nThe man whose death was confirmed on Thursday was the sixth person in the South Korean outbreak to get the virus through tertiary infection, meaning he caught it from a patient infected by the original carrier. All the other cases have been traced directly to the \"index\" patient.\n\nAs many as 1,164 schools in South Korea had closed or canceled classes by Thursday, the Ministry of Education said.\n\nWhile there has been no sustained human-to-human transmission, the virus could change and spread rapidly.\n\nSouth Korea's new cases bring the total number globally to about 1,180, based on World Health Organization (WHO) data, with at least 442 related deaths.\n\n(Reporting by Ju-min Park; Additional reporting by Jack Kim and Joyce Lee, and by Elaine Lies in TOKYO; Editing by Tony Munroe and Clarence Fernandez)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "south, korea, reports, third, mers, death, alarm, grows", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "South Korea on Thursday confirmed that a man who died a day earlier had been infected with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the third fatality in a virus outbreak that has fueled growing alarm in the country.", "title": "South Korea Reports Third MERS Death As Alarm Grows", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/south-korea-reports-third-mers-death-alarm-grows-336506", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/04/mers-outbreak-2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "South Korea on Thursday confirmed that a man who died a day earlier had been infected with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the third fatality in a virus outbreak that has fueled growing alarm in the country.", "title": "South Korea Reports Third MERS Death As Alarm Grows", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/south-korea-reports-third-mers-death-alarm-grows-336506", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/04/mers-outbreak-2.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/04/mers-outbreak-2.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-04T09:15:30-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-04T09:21:44-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "South Korea on Thursday confirmed that a man who died a day earlier had been infected with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), the third fatality in a virus outbreak that has fueled growing alarm in the country."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc712\"", "article_summary": "More than 1,100 schools were closed in South Korea on Thursday, while North Korea called for border checks.\nThe victim became the 36th confirmed MERS infection in South Korea, which has the most cases outside the Middle East.\nAs many as 1,164 schools in South Korea had closed or canceled classes by Thursday, the Ministry of Education said.\nSouth Korea lent North Korea three cameras to use at the complex during the recent scare over Ebola, the official said.\nJapan said it was looking into possible quarantine measures for people arriving from South Korea."}
