We have 10 children and we were trying to figure out how we were going to get a present for every one of them,\u201d Keri Merendon said. \u201cThey\u2019re still pretty young and they don\u2019t understand the meaning of Christmas yet. It\u2019s still about toys at that age.\u201d\n\nInstead of shopping for a gift for herself, Jada Bryant of Banning, was thinking of her three younger siblings, ages 2 through 11. \u201cThis morning I decided I wanted to buy them something for Christmas instead of something for myself,\u201d the 17-year-old said.\n\n\u201cJust for our kids to be able to come to the event here and be a part of the fun here today, I feel blessed for that,\u201d said her father, Deven Ray. \u201cThat Morongo extended this opportunity to us, it was a blessing.\u201d\n\nThe shopping spree is organized annually by Rick Lozano, founder of Christmas Cheer All Year and a longtime Fox 11 News journalist.\n\n\u201cYear after year, Morongo opens their hearts to help bring happiness to local children whose families are struggling through tough times,\u201d Lozano said. \u201cMorongo continues to help make a difference in the lives of disadvantaged children.\u201d\n\nFor the third year in a row, nearly 300 children in protective care with the Riverside County Department of Public Social Services (DPSS) took part in the shopping spree program. Without Morongo\u2019s help, these children would have gone without a present, county officials said.\n\n\u201cThe Morongo Band of Mission Indians\u2019 commitment to helping disadvantaged and abused children is an inspiring example of community spirit during this season of sharing,\u201d said Riverside County Supervisor Marion Ashley.\n\nMorongo transported 500 children from the San Gorgonio Pass and Coachella Valley to the shopping spree, including many from the James A. Venable Community Center in Cabazon.\n\n\u201cOur community continues to wrestle with extremely high poverty and unemployment rates that have many of the families we serve struggling just to keep a roof over their heads and to provide their children with necessities,\u201d said Josie Coates, manager of the Venable Community Center. \u201cEvery year, our kids get really excited about the shopping spree, and Morongo's support of this annual event is just another example of the tribe's willingness to help local families in our community.\u201d\n\nThe Morongo Band of Mission Indians has a long tradition of giving. The tribe contributes more than $1 million annually to support communities and non-profit organizations across the Inland Empire and Southern California.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tribe provides $100,000 for annual shopping spree benefitting disadvantaged and abused children", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "klb678", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/26/morongo-helps-holiday-wishes-comes-true-3000-inland-children-152871", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/morongo_shopping_spree_1.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Morongo Helps Holiday Wishes Comes True for 3,000 Inland Children"}, "dcterms.date": "2013-12-26T11:36-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/12/26/morongo-helps-holiday-wishes-comes-true-3000-inland-children-152871", "dc": {"title": "Morongo Helps Holiday Wishes Comes True for 3,000 Inland Children"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Morongo Helps Holiday Wishes Comes True for 3,000 Inland Children"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe Morongo Band of Indians is delighted to be spreading holiday joy again this year by treating 3,000 local children in need to a holiday shopping spree,\u201d said Morongo Tribal Chairman Robert Martin.\nTheir mother, Keri, said the shopping spree brought some peace of mind to her and her husband.\n\u201cYear after year, Morongo opens their hearts to help bring happiness to local children whose families are struggling through tough times,\u201d Lozano said.\nMorongo transported 500 children from the San Gorgonio Pass and Coachella Valley to the shopping spree, including many from the James A.
