Anyone who has been to a football game at Madison City Schools Stadium knows traffic can back up pretty bad before a game along Madison Boulevard and other area roads.

You potentially double that crowd in size, and it could be a nightmare for anyone trying to attend Donald Trump’s Sunday rally.

Trump campaign officials said gates will open at 1:00 p.m.

The Madison Police Department has released their traffic plan for the event Sunday.

1. Celtic Drive will become a one-way street (Northbound from Madison Blvd.) at Noon.

2. The Southbound lane, from the City Stadium to Madison Blvd, will be blocked off for pedestrian traffic only.

3. Celtic Drive will be closed to all through traffic at 3:30 p.m.

4. Parking will be available at the City Stadium in designated parking areas only.

5. Overflow parking will be available to the south at the Intergraph Parking Lot located at 305 Intergraph Way, and to the north at Bob Jones High School located at 650 Hughes Road. Trump buses will begin to transport spectators to the stadium at 11 a.m. from these areas.

Madison police, HEMSI, Madison County sheriffs, local fire departments, and the Secret Service are all coordinating on security and crowd control in anticipation of what could be a record crowd for the stadium.

“It's going to be crowded, It's going to be full, we're going to have police officers in vests with traffic wands,” said Capt. John Stringer, Madison PD. “Please

slow down, pay attention to their direction. It may seem like you're taking a little longer to get out, but smooth is fast in this situation.”

Madison police urge anyone who is not attending the rally to stay out of the area as there will be about a six hour period where traffic is expected to be bumper to bumper in the entire area.
