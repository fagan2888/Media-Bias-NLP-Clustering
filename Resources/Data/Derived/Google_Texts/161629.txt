Brooks was helping with tornado cleanup in the Farmersville area of Collin County on Tuesday when he happened upon an ironic find in a pile of rubble.

Amid a golf ball, a spray bottle, part of a treadmill, denim clothing, a photo and a doll was a DVD of Twister, the 1996 movie about storm chasers in Oklahoma.

“I heard the resident of the house that remained saying that when the roar outside turned to silence, he stepped outside to have a look, and as the sky was illuminated by a lightning bolt, he saw the tornado,” Brooks said. “Ten seconds later, another bolt showed the storm to be much closer and headed straight toward him.

“He ran inside, grabbed his mother, and led her to the bathroom at one of the houses, where they knelt and prayed. When the storm passed, the only room that remained intact was that bathroom.”

Brooks said the house was on a hill in Farmersville where four houses once stood, “and three are now gone with the wind.”

Brooks said the main focus of his volunteer work was gathering the larger debris — boards and metal — into large piles for the bulldozers to move later.

“My wife, a neighbor, and I involved ourselves in trying to salvage as many personal items as possible, as well as rounding up paperwork with checking information and Social Security numbers for storage in a safe place,” he said.
