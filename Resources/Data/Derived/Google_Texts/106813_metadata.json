Now he talks about going without a pump to raise awareness about the potential for security lapses and the need for better engineering.\n\nAlthough there have been no confirmed reports of cyber criminals gaining access to a medical device and harming patients, the Department of Homeland Security is investigating potential vulnerabilities in about two dozen devices, according to a Reuters report. Hollywood already has spun worst-case scenarios, including a 2012 episode in the \u201cHomeland\u201d series portraying a plot to kill the vice president by manipulating his pacemaker.\n\n\u201cThe good news is, we haven\u2019t seen actual active threats or deliberate attempts against medical devices yet,\u201d said Kevin Fu, a University of Michigan researcher who has made his career testing the vulnerability of medical systems.\n\nThe bad news is that hospital medical devices may be vulnerable to hackers simply because they can be the weak link that gives a criminal access to a hospital\u2019s data system \u2014 especially if the devices haven\u2019t been updated with the latest security patches, said Ken Hoyme, a scientist at Adventium Labs, a cybersecurity firm in Minneapolis.\n\nIn the real world, he said, a hacker is more likely interested in stealing records he can sell than in harming a patient.\n\n\u201cThere are not that many bad\u2026guys whose goal in life is to go and randomly mess with patients in hospitals,\u201d Hoyme said. \u201cThey want money, not to shut off the ventilator of a particular patient.\u201d\n\nHospitals are targets because they collect so much data, from patients\u2019 Social Security numbers and financial information to diagnosis codes and health insurance policy numbers.\n\nRadcliffe estimates that medical identity information is worth 10 times more than credit card information \u2014about $5 to $10 per record on the black market compared to 50 cents per account for credit card information.\n\nCrooks can use it to apply for credit, file fake claims with insurers or buy drugs and medical equipment that can be resold.\n\nAnd unlike the victims of credit card theft, those with stolen medical identities might not know for months or even years, giving the thieves more time to use their information.\n\nNew FDA Guidelines\n\nYet there are few cybersecurity standards for medical devices.\n\nIn October, the FDA issued guidance outlining what security features developers should bake into their products when seeking approval for a new device.\n\nThe guidelines, which aren\u2019t binding, say that when seeking approval for a new device, manufacturers should detail cybersecurity threats they considered and create better ways to detect when it might have been hacked.\n\nThey also should build in protections, such as limiting access to authorized users and restricting software updates only to products with authenticated coding.\n\nWhile a good start, some security experts say the guidelines should be binding. Others fear that giving them the force of regulation could be more harmful because they would become outdated quickly.\n\nNonetheless, the FDA\u2019s guidance has, in effect, changed the conversation among device makers from, \u201c\u2018Do I believe this is a real threat?\u2019 to \u2018What do I have to do to satisfy the FDA?\u2019\u201d said Hoyme.\n\nBy the end of the year, the agency is expected to issue similar recommendations for devices already on the market.\n\nCommon Vulnerabilities\n\nOne reason many existing devices might be vulnerable is they run on defunct operating systems such as Windows XP, which Microsoft stopped supporting in April, meaning there won\u2019t be any new security patches. Other, newer devices may have built-in passwords that are difficult to update. Gaining access to them can be fairly easy which could make them more vulnerable to attack, researchers say. In addition, sometimes, a password is intentionally disabled so it\u2019s easily accessible to medical staff in an emergency.\n\nHackers also can get into some inadequately protected hospital systems when staff members click on links in emails, not knowing they contain malicious code. Once transmitted to a hospital\u2019s intranet, that malware could find its way into unprotected device software and cause malfunctions, said Hoyme and Fu.\n\n\u201cIf cyber criminals decide they can hack into a device to get health records, they won\u2019t think about whether they\u2019re messing with device performance: They\u2019re going after the money,\u201d Hoyme said.\n\nSecurity experts warn that some of the same design flaws that make medical devices vulnerable also would make breaches hard to track.\n\n\u201cIf your iPhone is compromised, it\u2019s a lot more straightforward for someone to determine if it\u2019s been tampered with. We\u2019re not there yet\u201d with medical devices, said Billy Rios, a former Google software engineer turned security consultant.\n\nHe describes how he was able to buy a secondhand EKG machine, used to measure the heart\u2019s electrical activity, for just $25 online. Some infusion pumps and patient monitoring systems go for less than $100. That makes devices more readily available to those who want to figure out vulnerabilities to exploit.\n\n\u201cThe effort required is so much lower,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good position to be in.\u201d\n\nWhat Hospitals Are Doing\n\nHospitals are loathe to talk about device security publicly, but many are working to ensure their systems are stronger.\n\nIn a two-year test of information security, experts working for Essentia, a large Midwestern health system, found that many devices were hackable. For instance, they found settings on drug infusion pumps could be altered remotely to give patients incorrect doses, defibrillators could be manipulated to deliver random shocks and that medical records could be changed.\n\nStephen Curran, acting director of the Division of Resilience and Infrastructure Coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services, could not say how many facilities have a chief security officer or someone in charge of cybersecurity. But even small facilities have some relatively simple options for boosting the security of devices on their networks, he said, including \u201croutine backups and patching of the systems and the use of anti-virus firewalls.\u201d\n\nStill, while \u201cwe definitely see a trend in hospitals to improve their security,\u201d says Mike Ahmadi, global director of critical systems security at cybersecurity firm Codenomicon, vendors have to do more to engineer security.\n\n\u201cThe bigger issue is that vendors are not held accountable for writing insecure code,\u201d says researcher Rios. \u201cThere\u2019s no incentive\u2026so they don\u2019t invest.\u201d\n\nPressure On Vendors\n\nA few hospitals, including the Mayo Clinic, have started to write security requirements into their procurement contracts.\n\nAt the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, any new software application has to be approved by the hospital\u2019s security team, headed by Lessley Stoltenberg, chief information security officer.\n\nHe says device makers also will have to meet a slew of security requirements: Can the device be encrypted? Is there a unique identification for users? If the vendor is hosting the device, what does its system look like in terms of firewalls and other protections? Will the manufacturer provide up-to-date security patches?\n\nSome companies, such as Ahmadi\u2019s Codenomicon, specialize in selling software to detect software bugs that could lead to security holes.\n\nAlthough Codenomicon has a number of device makers as customers, those are a fraction of the more than 6,500 medical device manufacturers in the U.S., some of which may not be doing even the most basic testing. Most vendors are small \u2014 80 percent have fewer than 50 employees \u2014 and many are startups without the capital to invest in a security expert.\n\nSo, could hackers target infusion pumps or ventilators?\n\n\u201cIs it possible?\u201d Stoltenberg mused. \u201cYes. Is it likely? No. No device in the world is absolutely 100 percent secure.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Concern about the vulnerability of medical devices like insulin pumps, defibrillators, fetal monitors and scanners is growing.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Concern about the vulnerability of medical devices like insulin pumps, defibrillators, fetal monitors and scanners is growing.", "title": "Pacemakers Get Hacked On TV.
