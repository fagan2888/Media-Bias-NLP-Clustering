Most justices agree more frequently with the presidents that nominated them. (Michael Dwyer/AP)\n\nIf you are a justice of the Supreme Court, there\u2019s no president like your first president.\n\nMost members of the court make more decisions favorable to the president who brought them to the dance than they do to subsequent presidents, even those of the same party, according to a new study by two prominent Supreme Court experts.\n\nThe law professors say what they call the \u201cloyalty effect\u201d is evident even when other factors such as ideology and a personal relationship with the appointing president are taken into account.\n\n\u201cHowever, the loyalty effect is much stronger for Democratic justices than for Republicans justices,\u201d write Lee Epstein, of Washington University in St. Louis, and Eric A. Posner, of the University of Chicago.\n\nThat means that Democratic justices are less likely to vote for subsequent Democratic presidents, while the rate of variance for Republican nominees and subsequent Republican presidents is not as pronounced.\n\nEpstein and Posner wrote that their study, Supreme Court Justices\u2019 Loyalty to the President, came from an interest \u201cin loyalty \u2014 and a related phenomenon \u2014 gratitude \u2014 in politics, an understudied topic.\u201d\n\nPosner said in an interview that he began thinking about when the court \u2014 with two members appointed by President Obama \u2014 considered the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n[Supreme Court Upholds Afforadable Care Act]\n\nThe usual explanation for how a justice votes is ideology, Posner said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to imagine a justice recently appointed voting against a major initiative of the president.\u201d (As it turned out, Justice Elena Kagan went halfway, upholding the law\u2019s constitutionality but voting against a major Medicaid feature of it.)\n\nJudicial independence is a mainstay of American democracy, but politics plays a vital role in how a justice gets his or her job. Presidents look for those with similar views and values. A president, after all, can serve no more than eight years, while his nominees to the court stay for decades.\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. alluded to the process in a short speech at the White House after he took the oath in 2005.\n\n[Roberts sworn in as chief justice]\n\nHe thanked President George W. Bush for selecting him and praised the team at the White House for skillfully guiding his nomination. He thanked the senators for how they comported themselves and for approving his nomination. And then he said he looked forward to getting to work heading the third branch of government and the one that would pass judgment on the president\u2019s actions and the Congress\u2019 laws.\n\nBecause they are supposed to be independent, the justices fret about appearances. Epstein and Posner quote former chief justice William H. Rehnquist as contending that \u201cinstitutional pressures\u201d within the court \u201cweaken and diffuse the outside loyalties of any new appointee.\u201d\n\nRetired justice John Paul Stevens once said that \u201cthe political aspects of a federal judge\u2019s career should end when his or her nomination is confirmed.\u201d He refused to attend White House swearing-in ceremonies of justices, although as the acting chief justice he presided when Roberts took one of his oaths of office \u2014 there are two for federal judges \u2014 at the White House.\n\nIn theory, a justice owes nothing to his or her political benefactors \u2014 the lifetime appointment can be revoked only through a cumbersome impeachment process.\n\nBut Epstein and Posner supposed there had to be some sort of loyalty. They studied the Supreme Court appointees of presidents from Frankin D. Roosevelt to Obama, covering the Supreme Court terms of 1937 through 2014. They examined cases in which the president, a federal agency or an executive branch actor such as the attorney general was a party.\n\nAll but one of the justices examined voted at least a majority of times for the appointing president, with the mean being about 65 percent of the time. But again, Kagan emerged as the anomaly in the study.\n\nAccording to Epstein and Posner, Obama\u2019s former solicitor general has voted his way only about 49 percent of the time. But the data for Kagan is more limited. She came onto the court just before the October 2010 term commenced, and she recused herself in 17 of the cases that were studied because of her previous government work. If she had voted Obama\u2019s way in those cases, she would be closer to the mean, they said.\n\nNext, the professors looked at whether justices voted for their own presidents more than for subsequent executives. Most did, although two \u2014 Chief Justice Earl Warren, nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Justice Tom C. Clark, selected by President Harry S. Truman \u2014 went the other way. \u201cThey appear to be ingrates,\u201d Epstein and Posner wrote.\n\nMore interesting to the professors was how the justices voted when a subsequent president was of the same party. Democratic justices were less likely to vote for presidents of the same party than they were of the president who appointed them. Republican justices were just about even.\n\nThe professors weren\u2019t sure why this was so. Perhaps Republican presidents choose nominees for their ideological commitments, \u201cwhereas Democratic presidents choose Democratic justices with a range of other considerations in mind \u2014 including general and racial diversity, patronage and the like.\u201d\n\nStill, they conclude, \u201cwe are left with more questions than answers.\u201d\n\nOn the current court, Roberts and Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. have not had the chance to vote on cases involving presidents of the same party other than Bush, and Kagan and Justice Sonia Sotomayor have only voted on Obama cases.\n\nPosner said a related finding jumped out: Obama has been on the winning side just about 50 percent of the time, far lower than other presidents.\n\nIt can be partly explained this way: The party challenging a lower court ruling, called the \u201cpetitioner\u201d at the Supreme Court, has a much greater chance of winning than the party that prevailed in the appeals court, called the \u201crespondent.\u201d In about two-thirds of the cases it accepts, the court rules for the challenger.\n\nThe Obama administration has been the respondent in a greater percentage of cases than any administration other than John F. Kennedy\u2019s, the study showed.\n\nThat shouldn\u2019t explain everything, Posner said. But it does suggest the next study, he said: \u201cTo explain why Obama loses so much.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A study finds that members of the Supreme Court tend to support the administrations that put them there.
