It has been almost five months since a local teenager died in a crash while on the way to school, but his memory is still very much alive.

Friends and family came in droves to honor Dylan Mabry, a loved one lost too soon. The Lauderdale county Ag Center played host to the Dylan Mabry benefit, a rodeo honoring the young man who loved bull riding almost as much as he loved his community. The Clarkdale community returned that love as huge number of them came out to support the benefit in his honor. The benefit itself is a great reflection and celebration of the life of young Dylan Mabry, according to Toni Buchanan.

"We need to celebrate and smile, because if Dylan was here and knew he had his own rodeo, he'd be smiling from ear to ear as happy as he could be," Buchanan says. "We're here to remember the good times"

Although professional riders were on hand at the event, the real story is that of Dylan's friends, who rode the bucking beasts to honor their friend Dylan. Dylan's mother says the rodeo was the perfect way to honor her son.

"It is a huge event," Dana Riley says. "Dylan always wanted his name in spotlights for riding bulls and this is his night."

It's not just a rodeo though, the atmosphere was buzzing with activities from a silent auction, fun rodeo type games, snow cones, delicious barbecue, and live music going on all day. All the money raised from the benefit will go towards paying for Dylan's medical bills and funeral costs.
