Ted Cruz, as he remains the closest alternative to GOP frontrunner Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cTed Cruz is the best free-market, pro-growth, limited-government candidate in the presidential race,\u201d said Club for Growth President David McIntosh in a statement released Wednesday. He went on:\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Club\u2019s PAC has never endorsed in a presidential race, but this year is different because there is a vast gulf between the two leading Republican candidates on matters of economic liberty. Their records make clear that Ted Cruz is a consistent conservative who will fight to shrink the federal footprint, while Donald Trump would seek to remake government in his desired image. That\u2019s why the Club\u2019s PAC is urging everyone in the conservative movement to join in this important campaign to elect Ted Cruz as President.\n\nGOP frontrunner Donald Trump has fired shots at McIntosh, charging that the Club for Growth president with dismissing his candidacy for refusing to donate $1 million to the group. Trump called for McIntosh\u2019s resignation from the Club for Growth leadership position last June. CFG spokesperson Doug Sachtleben shot back, \u201cTrump asked for a meeting with the Club, and expressed interest in donating to our organization, so of course we responded,\u201d in a statement to Breitbart News.\n\nThe Club for Growth has been criticized for supporting liberal Republicans like Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), praised establishment darling Jeb Bush for his record as Florida\u2019s governor, and failed to push back on amnesty and Obamacare.\n\nCruz has been lauded for his opposition to amnesty and Obamacare. There has been a slow buildup behind Cruz\u2019s campaign, as establishment favorites like Bush legacy Jeb! and de-facto amnesty bill pushing Sen. Marco Rubio have dropped from the race for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nBush also endorsed Cruz Wednesday morning, the day after the Arizona and Utah primary contests. Trump won all of Arizona\u2019s 58 delegates and Cruz took Utah\u2019s 40 with an overwhelming near 70 per cent of the vote. Prominent establishment figure Sen. Lindsey Graham, who once joked of killing Cruz on the Senate floor without consequence, held a fundraiser for Cruz on Monday in the midst of AIPAC.\n\nRubio failed to succeed in his bid for the White House despite establishment endorsements like Gov. Nikki Haley and Rep. Trey Gowdy. With heavy establishment backing in states like South Carolina, Rubio still failed to secure a win in that state. Even after failed 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney recorded robocalls for Rubio to run in his home state of Florida, the junior senator failed to succeed there. Trump took a strong position over Rubio in the March 15 Florida primary. Haley has since stated support, but stopped short of an official endorsement, for Cruz.\n\nAversion to Trump has driven establishment and conservative figures alike to push for a competitive alternative. That has led several establishment figures and entities to push for the constitutional conservative they may never have imagined pushing before he became the only viable Trump alternative. Even Romney waited until days before his home state of Utah\u2019s primary to make a half-hearted Twitter announcement that he would vote for Cruz. Romney\u2019s lack of enthusiasm was displayed in the remark, \u201cI think a lot of people were surprised by how well Ted Cruz did.\u201d Cruz did not even utilize the failed 2012 nominee\u2019s assistance going into the March 15 pivotal primary elections despite Romney\u2019s highly publicized anti-Trump speech and the former Massachusetts\u2019 governor\u2019s stumping for the other two remaining candidates at the time, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Rubio.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "Club For Growth PAC Makes First Ever Presidential Endorsement with Ted Cruz", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Club For Growth PAC Makes First Ever Presidential Endorsement with Ted Cruz", "title": "Club For Growth PAC Makes First Ever Presidential Endorsement with Ted Cruz - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/Ted-Cruz-Grabbing-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/03/23/club-for-growth-pac-makes-first-ever-presidential-endorsement-with-ted-cruz/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Club For Growth PAC Makes First Ever Presidential Endorsement with Ted Cruz", "title": "Club For Growth PAC Makes First Ever Presidential Endorsement with Ted Cruz - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/Ted-Cruz-Grabbing-AP.jpg", "creator": "@michellediana", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "anti-Trump, Arizona, Club For Growth, Donald Trump, endorse, Establishment, Florida, Jeb Bush, John Kasich, Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, Mitt Romney, Nikki Haley, republican, South Carolina, Ted Cruz, Utah,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Club for Growth", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-03-23T16:45:12-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/michdimoo", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Utah", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s why the Club\u2019s PAC is urging everyone in the conservative movement to join in this important campaign to elect Ted Cruz as President.\n\u201cTed Cruz is the best free-market, pro-growth, limited-government candidate in the presidential race,\u201d said Club for Growth President David McIntosh in a statement released Wednesday.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe Club for Growth PAC joined the drip drip of establishment figures lining up behind presidential candidate Sen.
