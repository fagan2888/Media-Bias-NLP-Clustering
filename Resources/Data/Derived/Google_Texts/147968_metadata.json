Rand Paul (R-KY) raised expectations among conservatives in a speech to CPAC on Friday when he promised he will soon unveil a blockbuster new economic proposal.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cIn the coming weeks, I will propose the largest tax cut in American history,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI propose we cut everyone\u2019s taxes, from the richest to the poorest.\u201d\n\nPaul raised expectations even further when he claimed that his proposal \u201cwill also cut spending and balance the budget in just five years.\u201d\n\nIf Paul can deliver on that promise, it may distinguish him in a very crowded field of 2016 Republican Presidential contenders that has seen Gov. Scott Walker (R-WI) race to the top of recent polls, while former Gov. Jeb Bush (R-FL) continues to amass what may be as much as $100 million in a campaign war chest.\n\nPaul continued to hit on his outsider theme in his speech.\n\n\u201cTo fix Washington we can\u2019t have business as usual,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI propose something truly outrageous. Congress should read every bill.\u201d\n\nThe line drew strong applause from the audience, but Paul did not elaborate on the details of that proposal.\n\n\u201cCongress should also live under the laws they pass,\u201d he said, noting that he supports a constitutional amendment that says \u201cCongress shall pass no law that exempts themselves.\u201d\n\nPaul also added that he supports a constitutional amendment that limits the terms members of Congress should serve.\n\n\u201cWe should limit all their terms and send career politicians packing. While we\u2019re at it maybe we ought to limit the terms of out-of-control federal judges as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt home our nation needs new ideas and new answers to old problems,\u201d Paul said, evoking the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King.\n\n\u201cMartin Luther King spoke of two Americas,\u201d Paul said.\n\nIn one America, he said, we have life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In the other, however, the outlook is bleak.\n\n\u201cIn my trips to Ferguson, Detroit, Los Angeles, Atlanta. . . I\u2019ve seen that liberal policies have failed our inner cities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must break down the wall that separates us.\u201d\n\nPaul also blasted Obamacare, and vowed to repeal it.\n\n\u201cIn the mistake of the century Justice Roberts said we must presume Obamacare is constitutional. I\u2019ve got a better idea \u2026 As a doctor I will make it my mission to heal the nation, reverse the course of Obamacare and repeal every last bit of it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cObama\u2019s fundamental promise if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor was a lie.\u201d\n\nPaul also criticized the federal government\u2019s violation of the privacy of citizens.\n\n\u201cTo defend our country we need to gather intelligence on the enemy but when the intelligence lies to Congress how are we to trust them?\u201d he asked rhetorically.\n\n\u201cThe phone records of law abiding citizens are none of their damn business\u201d\n\nPaul also addressed the issue of foreign policy, an area where some have criticized his views as isolationist.\n\n\u201cOur freedom is threatened from outside our borders,\u201d he said \u201cWe must protect ourselves from jihadists.\u201d\n\nPaul criticized Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the 2016 Democratic nomination for President, as an utter failure in foreign policy during her tenure as Secretary of State.\n\n\u201cIn the Middle East one form of tyranny replaces another,\u201d Paul said, placing the blame on both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cHillary\u2019s War in Libya\u2026 made us less safe\u2026 radical jihadists [now] run amuck.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe Hillary Clinton\u2019s abdication of responsibility [in her handling of the Benghazi attacks and the murder of our ambassador there]\u2026 her dereliction of duty should forever preclude her from high office,\u201d Paul continued.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for Hillary Clinton to permanently retire,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIn the Middle East a dangerous and barbaric cult has arisen. . . ISIS grew in a safe haven created by arming rebels in the Syrian civil war,\u201d Paul said, something he predicted was a strong likelihood when the rebels were armed.\n\n\u201cWithin a year,\u201d he said, \u201cthat prediction came true.\u201d\n\nPaul called ISIS \u201ca barbarous aberration.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need a national defense,\u201d he said, that is \u201crobust enough, modern enough [and] nimble.\u201d\n\nPaul also called for \u201ca foreign policy that encourages stability not chaos.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt home,\u201d Paul said, \u201cthe government is the problem, not the solution.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should not succumb to the notion that a government inept at home will somehow be a success abroad. . . We must be strong. We must defend ourselves,\u201d he added.\n\nWe need, Paul said, \u201ca national defense that is unparalleled, undefeatable, and unencumbered by nation building.\u201d\n\nWe need \u201cto promote, as Ronald Reagan put it, \u2018peace through strength.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not project strength,\u201d Paul added, \u201cby borrowing money from China to send it to Pakistan.\u201d\n\nPaul said it angers him to see people protesting against America in countries that receive foreign aid from us.\n\n\u201cNot one penny more to these haters of America,\u201d he said.\n\nAmid some chants of \u201cPresident Paul, President Paul\u201d from the audience, Paul closed his speech with an altar call for liberty.\n\n\u201cOur best days are ahead of us. What drives us is the desire for freedom,\u201d he concluded.\n\n\u201cWill you stand with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you fight for freedom?\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you vote for freedom?\u201d\n\nIn the question and answer session that followed his speech, Paul said that Republicans can win over libertarians, moderates, and independents, but need to change their emphasis.\n\n\u201cWe do a great job defending the 2nd amendment, but we have to defend the whole Bill of Rights,\u201d Paul said. One right in particular that needs attention is due process.\n\nPaul cited the case of Kalief Browder, a 16-year-old boy accused of a crime,who spent three years in Rikers Island and tried to commit suicide four times, he said, without having the benefit of a speedy trial.\n\nPaul also said that if he could have just one constitutional amendment passed it would be term limits for members of Congress.\n\nHis biggest criticism of Congress, he added, is that it is \u201cdysfunctional.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven when we agree on something, we can\u2019t get it done\u2026. We lurch from one deadline to the next deadline,\u201d he said.\n\nFollow Michael Patrick Leahy on Twitter @michaelpleahy", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rand Paul Promises to Propose \u2018The Largest Tax Cut in American History\u2019 in CPAC Speech", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Rand Paul Promises to Propose \u2018The Largest Tax Cut in American History\u2019 in CPAC Speech", "title": "Rand Paul Promises to Propose \u2018The Largest Tax Cut in American History\u2019 in CPAC Speech - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Paul227.jpg", "height": 600}, "updated_time": "2015-02-27T11:52:55-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/27/rand-paul-promises-to-propose-the-largest-tax-cut-in-american-history-in-cpac-speech/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rand Paul Promises to Propose \u2018The Largest Tax Cut in American History\u2019 in CPAC Speech", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Paul227.jpg", "title": "Rand Paul Promises to Propose \u2018The Largest Tax Cut in American History\u2019 in CPAC Speech - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Chief Justice John Roberts, Hillary Clinton, Kalief Browder, obamacare, Rand Paul,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Breitbart TV,Rand Paul", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-02-27T11:12:39-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-02-27T11:52:55-07:00", "tag": "Rand Paul", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Amid some chants of \u201cPresident Paul, President Paul\u201d from the audience, Paul closed his speech with an altar call for liberty.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cIn the coming weeks, I will propose the largest tax cut in American history,\u201d Paul said.\nPaul also said that if he could have just one constitutional amendment passed it would be term limits for members of Congress.\nISIS grew in a safe haven created by arming rebels in the Syrian civil war,\u201d Paul said, something he predicted was a strong likelihood when the rebels were armed.\nCongress should read every bill.\u201dThe line drew strong applause from the audience, but Paul did not elaborate on the details of that proposal."}
