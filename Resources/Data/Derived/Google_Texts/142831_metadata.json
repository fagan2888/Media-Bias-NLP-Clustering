Wendy, CC BY-SA 2.0\n\nThere\u2019s a preexisting notion that the more distance between an animal and a human on the evolutionary chain, the more their facial expressions differ. However, new research published in PLOS One finds humans and horses may actually have the same face.\n\nLike humans, researchers reported, horses use the muscles underlying their facial features, including their nostrils, lips, and eyes, during various social situations. So, to build on previous studies, the researchers designed an equine version of the existing Facial Action Coding System (EquiFACS) in order to objectively identify all the facial expressions horses produce. Since the original system was developed for humans, researchers would be able to compare the codes for any similarities.\n\nThe process of understanding horses\u2019 facial expressions was two-fold: one, researchers used \u201can innovative \u2018face mask\u2019 method, where the facial musculature [from a single horse\u2019s head] is removed from the deep muscles and the skull of the skin, creating a \u2018facial mask\u2019 that holds all of the facial muscles.\u201d The anatomical investigation allowed them to examine the muscles and their attachments to the bone, skin, and cartilage, as well as provide a three-dimensional comparison to one another as well as to the horse\u2019s skull. Then, researchers analyzed existing video footage of 86 horses\u2019, measuring for certain behaviors, including how they interacted with humans.\n\nThough facial structures among horses and humans are different, researchers were able to identify similar expressions. For example, in some situations, \u201chorses will display more of the white sclera due to a change in the opening of the eye or position of the eyeball.\u201d The amount of sclera is associated with fear, and like humans, horses\u2019 widen their eyes when they\u2019re scared.\n\n\u201cHorses also have a zygomatic major muscle (generally termed the zygomaticus muscle) that pulls the lip corners back,\u201d the researchers added. \u201cHowever, this action has a slightly different appearance in horses due to their different facial morphology.\u201d Still, horses\u2019 can pull their lips back in a curl, exposing their teeth and gums.\n\nJennifer Wathan, an author of the study and doctoral researcher at the University of Sussex in London, explained that despite being predominantly visual animals, horses\u2019 facial expressions have \u201cbeen largely overlooked.\u201d Wathan was genuinely surprised to find \u201cthe rich repertoire of complex facial movements in horses, and how many of them are similar to humans.\u201d\n\nThese findings, Wathan said, \u201ccontribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting that social factors have had a significant influence on the evolution of facial expression.\u201d Their coding system allows them to document facial movements in different social and emotional contexts, which will eventually help them better understand how horses socialize. More interesting than that is the potential of these findings to improve the current understanding of the social condition and comparative psychology.\n\nOne study from Valdosta State University cited that social cognition attempts \u201cto understand and explain how the thoughts, feelings, and behavior of individuals are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others.\u201d If we\u2019re strictly talking animals, separate research shows the process of domestication enables, say, dogs to communicate with humans in unique ways \u2014 they essentially develop social-cognitive abilities.\n\n\u201cConsequently, horses show fission-fusion dynamics; a variation of the same complex social organization that is seen in humans, bonobos, chimpanzees, and macaques, as well as elephants, spotted hyenas, and many cetaceans,\u201d the researchers concluded. \u201cGroup life in these societies is determined by complex, long-term social relationships that must be maintained, suggesting effective communication would be adaptive.\u201d\n\nSource: Wathan J, Burrows A, Waller BM, and McComb K.
