This week a gathering of Christian leaders brought another cause to the top of the agenda: domestic violence.\n\nInstead of viewing it as a personal or family concern, the Sojourners Summit, which concludes Saturday (June 20), zeroed in on domestic violence as a human rights issue, hoping to shine the spotlight on a problem little talked about in many Christian circles.\n\nA study commissioned last year by Sojourners and IMA World Health, an international, nonprofit health care service, found that most Protestant pastors greatly underestimate sexual and other violence against women. Worse, conservative pastors who teach \u201cmale headship\u201d and submission of wives to their husbands may do more harm than good when counseling couples or individuals.\n\n\u201cExperts identify a link between masculine ideals of power and control and violence against women and girls,\u201d said Carolyn Custis James, an evangelical theologian and author of \u201cMalestrom: Manhood Swept into the Currents of a Changing World.\u201d\n\nJames, who spoke at the summit, added: \u201cA theology based upon patriarchal notions that empowers men over women \u2014 who are expected to submit \u2014 establishes a relational system that can easily lead to violence and others forms of abuse.\u201d\n\nTaking the issue of domestic violence out of the personal realm and making it a justice issue is necessary, the study concludes, because it requires the full force of the legal system as well as social institutions, including faith communities. Without this attention to the issue, victims will continue to feel isolated and lack support systems.\n\nEight in 10 pastors recognize they need to know more about protecting victims of sexual and domestic violence and wish they had more training and resources. Most had received no training in seminary or other pastoral preparation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for our Christian leaders to stand up and say that women, made in the very image of God, deserve better,\u201d said Jim Wallis, Sojourners\u2019 president and founder. \u201cAnd it\u2019s time for us in the faith community to acknowledge our complicity in a culture that too often not only remains silent, but also can propagate a false theology of power and dominance.\u201d\n\nA majority of pastors surveyed say they have responded to sexual or domestic violence by providing marriage counseling, a potentially dangerous or even lethal response for the victim, who is then not separated from the perpetrator.\n\nIronically, gender-based violence is often addressed in the overseas programs of faith-based NGOs like IMA World Health, World Vision, and others. An organization called \u201cWe Will Speak Out\u201d is a global coalition of faith-based groups working to end gender-based violence around the world. IMA World Health now serves as the U.S. secretariat for the group.\n\nWhile visiting the work of IMA World Health to prevent gender-based violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, board member Rev. Amy Gopp asked what the organization was doing in the U.S. to combat the same problem. Her concerns led the organization to initiate the study and begin its first domestic program.\n\n\u201cLet us not fool ourselves into thinking that sexual and gender-based violence happens only, or even primarily, in the developing world or transitional societies,\u201d writes Gopp. \u201cMore than one in three women in the United States have reportedly experienced sexual assault, physical violence or stalking by an intimate partner during their lifetime. That\u2019s too many.\u201d\n\nBy raising the visibility of gender-based violence in the U.S. and addressing it as an issue of social justice, Christian leaders hope to bring help to those women who have too often felt isolated or abandoned by their own faith communities.\n\n(Dale Hanson Bourke is a contributing editor for RNS and editor of PracticingFaith.com.)\n\nYS/AMB END BOURKE", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Ethics, Institutions, Christian, domestic violence, evangelicals, IMA World Health, Protestant, Sojourners Summit", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "WASHINGTON (RNS) The Sojourners Summit zeroed in on domestic violence as a human rights issue, hoping to shine the spotlight on a problem little talked about in many Christian circles.", "title": "Domestic violence moves up on Christian social justice agenda at summit", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/19/domestic-violence-moves-christian-social-justice-agenda-summit/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/thumbRNS-DOMESTIC-VIOLENCE061815a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/19/domestic-violence-moves-christian-social-justice-agenda-summit/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/06/19/domestic-violence-moves-christian-social-justice-agenda-summit/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "WASHINGTON (RNS) The Sojourners Summit zeroed in on domestic violence as a human rights issue, hoping to shine the spotlight on a problem little talked about in many Christian circles."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8965\"", "article_summary": "This week a gathering of Christian leaders brought another cause to the top of the agenda: domestic violence.\nIronically, gender-based violence is often addressed in the overseas programs of faith-based NGOs like IMA World Health, World Vision, and others.\nWhile visiting the work of IMA World Health to prevent gender-based violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, board member Rev.\nIMA World Health now serves as the U.S. secretariat for the group.\nAn organization called \u201cWe Will Speak Out\u201d is a global coalition of faith-based groups working to end gender-based violence around the world."}
