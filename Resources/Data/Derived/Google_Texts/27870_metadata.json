The worst part is that we have no recourse.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Feds rile ranchers by fencing off water for cattle \u2014 to protect a jumping mouse!\n\nMr. Lopez was one of seven speakers who called on Congress last week to provide more oversight over the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and other federal agencies that he said are abusing their authority at the expense of rural residents.\n\nThe emotional testimony came at a House Natural Resources subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation hearing Thursday called, \u201cThreats, Intimidation and Bullying by Federal Land Managing Agencies.\u201d\n\nThe hearing was the second on what rural residents describe as a worrisome shift in the attitude of federal agents, who are increasingly the product of university programs that view grazing, logging and other natural resource-based industries with a jaundiced eye.\n\nSEE ALSO: Westerners press for more control over their land\n\nThose testifying Thursday said that the relationship between rural America and federal agencies has never been worse, accusing land managers of violating federal and state laws in order to make life more difficult for ranchers and others.\n\n\u201cThis is about relationships. It\u2019s not about disagreement over policy,\u201d said Albuquerque attorney Blair Dunn, who represents Otero County, New Mexico \u201cThis is about federal employees, federal agencies, and federal bureaucrats not following the laws.\u201d\n\nSeveral speakers cited the standoff between the Forest Service and New Mexico ranchers in Otero County, where the agency built a pipe fence around the Agua Chiquita watering hole in the Lincoln National Forest in order to keep out cattle, even though a local ranching family owns the water rights.\n\nForest Service officials have pointed out that they left two 10-foot openings for the cattle to enter elsewhere, but Rep. Steve Pearce, New Mexico Republican, countered, \u201cImagine trying to herd a large number of cattle through a 10-foot wide opening in a fence.\u201d\n\n\u201cBureaucrats and special interest groups treat that as a solution. I believe it\u2019s a shell game,\u201d said Mr. Pearce. \u201cThe fact that the agency would claim water rights don\u2019t exist when they clearly do is an example of the federal government\u2019s arrogance and an attempt to bully our local ranchers into submission.\u201d\n\nThe tension in the rural West over federal overreach exploded in April during Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy\u2019s standoff with the BLM. During the episode, there were skirmishes between federal agents and Bundy supporters.\n\nRep. Raul Grijalva, Arizona Democrat, said that while there have been examples of \u201cheavy-handedness\u201d by armed federal agents, \u201cthere were also very graphic pictures of militia folks supporting Bundy on the highway pointing weapons at U.S. marshals.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat kind of a confrontation is something I think none of us want,\u201d said Mr. Grijalva.\n\nMr. Grijalva also described the complaints as isolated incidents, arguing that most land managers oversee the federal government\u2019s extensive property holdings in the West without incident.\n\n\u201cI think we can all agree that the vast majority act in a professional and courteous manner,\u201d said Mr. Grijalva. \u201cUnfortunately, like any company, organization or government, there will be instances where employees do not live up to that standard, and they must be held accountable.\u201d\n\nBut Elko County Commissioner Grant Gerber said the problem is bigger than just a few bad actors. When he was growing up in Nevada, federal managers were \u201cfriendly, they came to the ranch, we worked with them, but over the years that\u2019s changed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re predominantly from outside the area and do not develop connections with the locals,\u201d said Mr. Gerber. \u201cMany start out with a belligerent attitude, even a commanding presence. They\u2019re especially offended if anyone opposes any federal government actions.\u201d\n\nGarfield County Commissioner Leland Pollock of Utah insisted that the depiction of rural Americans as anti-government renegades is incorrect.\n\n\u201cSome of you folks back here may think that we\u2019re anti-government, and that\u2019s just not the case,\u201d said Mr. Pollock. \u201cWe\u2019re reaching out today as well as we will back in Utah to try to forge relationships, to try to work through these issues.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jose Varela Lopez recounts with pride that his family has been ranching in New Mexico since 1600 -- a staggering 14 generations -- but he worries that this generation may be the last.", "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Jose Varela Lopez recounts with pride that his family has been ranching in New Mexico since 1600 \u2014 a staggering 14 generations \u2014 but he worries that this generation may be the last.", "title": "Westerners call for oversight to combat federal land managers", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/27/westerners-call-for-oversight-to-combat-federal-la/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/27/7_272014_steve-pearce8201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/27/7_272014_steve-pearce8201.jpg", "title": "Westerners call for oversight to combat federal land managers", "description": "Jose Varela Lopez recounts with pride that his family has been ranching in New Mexico since 1600 -- a staggering 14 generations -- but he worries that this generation may be the last.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Jose Varela Lopez, Forest Service"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9db0\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Grijalva also described the complaints as isolated incidents, arguing that most land managers oversee the federal government\u2019s extensive property holdings in the West without incident.\nSEE ALSO: Westerners press for more control over their landThose testifying Thursday said that the relationship between rural America and federal agencies has never been worse, accusing land managers of violating federal and state laws in order to make life more difficult for ranchers and others.\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing daily with individual and collective efforts to remove families like mine from the land.\n\u201cSome of you folks back here may think that we\u2019re anti-government, and that\u2019s just not the case,\u201d said Mr. Pollock.\nThey\u2019re especially offended if anyone opposes any federal government actions.\u201dGarfield County Commissioner Leland Pollock of Utah insisted that the depiction of rural Americans as anti-government renegades is incorrect."}
