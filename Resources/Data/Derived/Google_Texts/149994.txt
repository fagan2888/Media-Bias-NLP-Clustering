Since the October 1st launch of the Affordable Care Act website there has been no Frequently Asked Question more frequently asked than "who is that girl?"

Thanks to the intrepid shoe-leather work of the folks at ABC News, we finally have our answer: A married mother of one from Colombia who is not technically an American citizen.

Adriana (last name withheld by ABC), a permanent resident who has lived in the US for the past six years with her husband and (now) 21-month-old son, told the news outlet she never set out to be the face of American healthcare reform â€” she just wanted some free family photos.

After reaching out to a "contact" at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Adriana was told the photoshoot would be arranged if she agreed to let the resulting portraits be used to promote Obamacare.

And so she became an unintentional spokesmodel for ACA, with all the verbal abuse and "cyberbulling" that entailed.

"I mean, I don't know why people should hate me because it's just a photo," she told ABC. "I didn't design the website. I didn't make it fail, so I don't think they should have any reasons to hate me."

In fact, Adriana has no personal opinion about Obamacare one way or another, and has no immediate intentions to sign up for it.

The photo has since been taken down, but the Department of Health and Human Services told ABC News it wasn't because Adriana asked to have it removed.

"Healthcare.gov is a dynamic website," a spokesperson is quoted as saying.

Dynamic maybe, but certainly dysfunctional, and definitely disappointing.

For her part, Adriana is just happy the focus is back on the site itself rather than the "vaguely ethnic smiling woman" (per Stephen Colbert) on its homepage.

"Now I laugh about it," she says. Thanks, Obamacare!
