Earlier this week, in an appearance with Megyn Kelly, he praised Trump.\n\nCruz told Kelly, \u201cI salute Donald Trump for focusing on the need to address illegal immigration. I think amnesty\u2019s wrong, and I salute Donald Trump for focusing on it.\u201d Cruz added, \u201cI like Donald Trump. He\u2019s bold, he\u2019s brash.\u201d\n\nBut wait! Cruz made his name as a crusader against Obamacare, which he views as a fundamental threat to American liberty. Yet, Trump has said we \u201cmust have universal healthcare\u201d under a system that \u201clooks a lot like Canada.\u201d Such a system would be an even greater intrusion on our liberty than Obamacare.\n\nMoreover, as Marc Thiessen has pointed out, Trump helped finance the Democratic takeover of Congress without which Obamacare never would have been enacted. And even after Congress passed Obamacare, Trump continued to contribute to congressional Democrats, including Harry Reid whose 2010 reelection campaign he supported.\n\nNor has Trump been a consistent voice on immigration. After Mitt Romney lost to Barack Obama in 2012, Trump opined that that Republicans will continue to lose elections if they came across as mean-spirited and unwelcoming to people of color. Now, candidate Trump is bad-mouthing illegal immigrants with comments such this:\n\nWhen Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re sending people that have lots of problems. And they\u2019re bringing those problems with us. They\u2019re bringing drugs, they\u2019re bringing crime, they\u2019re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.\n\nTrump, then, isn\u2019t \u201cbold\u201d at all. Rather, he takes whatever position he thinks will serve his interests at a particular time.\n\nCruz explained to Kelly that he\u2019s \u201cnot going to engage in the media\u2019s game of throwing rocks and attacking other Republicans.\u201d Fine. But that doesn\u2019t mean he should salute an obvious fraud like Donald Trump.\n\nWhy is Cruz saluting him? Opportunism. He believes, as I do, that Trump\u2019s support will evaporate once Republicans learn of his liberal, pro-Democrat history. Cruz wants to be the candidate who gains the bulk of Trump\u2019s support.\n\nMoreover, Cruz is determined never to let a Republican contender get to the right of him on any issue. That\u2019s why he stood with Rand Paul during the Kentucky Senator\u2019s filibuster which was premised on the fear that the U.S. government will attack Americans while they type emails in the nation\u2019s outdoor cafes.\n\nFor that matter, it\u2019s why Cruz pushed for the partial government shutdown, a move that was never going to stop Obamacare, but was sure to elevate the Senator into preeminent status among opponents of Obama\u2019s signature domestic program.\n\nCruz, I\u2019ve been reliably informed, has a low regard for Paul, and surely his assessment of Trump is no more flattering. The Texas Senator is far too intelligent to view either rival as presidential material and too genuinely conservative not to hold the formerly liberal Trump in contempt.\n\nAgain, it\u2019s fine if Cruz wishes to keep these opinions to himself. But he does conservatives a disservice by sucking up to Trump.\n\nThe tycoon isn\u2019t one of us, and Cruz shouldn\u2019t pretend otherwise.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Power Line", "description": "Several Republican presidential candidates have been critical of Donald Trump, but Ted Cruz is not among them.
