COTATI, Calif. (AP) — Two cousins who were among the victims killed when a balcony collapsed will be mourned at a Northern California funeral and memorial service on Saturday.

Ashley Donohoe, 22, the lone American among the dead, will be honored at the funeral at a Catholic church in Cotati, near her home in Rohnert Park.

Her cousin, 21-year-old Olivia Burke, will also be memorialized before her body is sent back to her native Ireland.

A celebration of the women’s lives will follow at Sonoma State University.

They were among the six people killed on Tuesday when the balcony snapped off the fifth floor of a Berkeley apartment building during a birthday party, tossing 13 people to the street 50 feet below. Seven people are being treated in hospitals.

The other four dead victims were mourned at a Friday night vigil in Oakland attended by family members and dozens of their fellow Irish students — including some who saw them in their final moments.

Hearses carried the four metal caskets into St. Columba Catholic Church, where about 15 of the victims’ immediate family members huddled together in the rectory for about an hour before entering the church for the private viewing. Reporters were not allowed inside.
