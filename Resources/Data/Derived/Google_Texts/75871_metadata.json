Every Single One of Them.\u2019\n\nPresident Obama has for years benefitted greatly from then-Senate Majority Leader (Democrat) Harry Reid serving as a preemptive veto of most things legislation.\n\nSenate Sitting on 290 Bills Already Passed by House; Tension Mounts (2010)\n\nDemocrat Senate Blocks 340 House Bills (2014)\n\nThis Do-Nothing-Democrat-Senate allowed Democrats and the media (please pardon the redundancy) to foster a phony \u201cDo Nothing Congress\u201d storyline. Which the President gladly, disingenuously exploited:\n\nObama: \u2018If Congress Won\u2019t Act, I Will\u2019\n\nThe President has acted unilaterally throughout \u2013 well beyond the Executive Branch bounds proscribed by the Constitution.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s Unilateral Action on Immigration Has No Precedent\n\nObama\u2019s Unilateral ObamaCare Changes\n\nObama Continues to Push Unilateral Action to Fight Climate Change\n\nCastro on Obama\u2019s Cuba Deal: \u2018Now We\u2019ve Really Won the War\u2019\n\nThese Presidential fiats beget regulations. Lots and lots and LOTS of regulations.\n\n21,000 Regulations So Far Under Obama \u2013 2,375 Set for 2015\n\nObama Imposed 75,000 Pages of New Regulations in 2014\n\n11,588,500 Words: Obamacare Regs 30x as Long as Law\n\nNew EPA Regs Issued Under Obama Are 43 Times as Long as Bible\n\nAll elections matter, but some matter more than others. A national election of historic proportions is about to be trumped by an obscure vote by three Democrat regulators. For whom none of us ever voted \u2013 and of whom most of us have never heard.\n\nThese regulations cost us money. Lots and lots and LOTS of money.\n\nThe Cost of Federal Regulation: $2.028 Trillion\n\nThis brings us to the Internet. Per law passed by Congress \u2013 the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \u2013 the Internet is a relatively regulation-free zone. Which is why it is a free speech-free market Xanadu \u2013 dynamically, constantly evolving into an ever more-perfect organism.\n\nThe 1996 Act classifies the Internet as a Title I thing \u2013 Title I being the light-touch portion of the law. Landline phones, on the other hand, are uber-over-regulated under Title II \u2013 which is why hardlines have for decades been basically innovation-free zones.\n\nWhich brings us to the Left\u2019s fetish \u2013 and their current push for \u2013 Network Neutrality.\n\nThe Executive Branch\u2019s Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has already twice tried to impose Net Neutrality within the confines of law-proscribed Title I. And twice been unanimously rebuked by the D.C. Circuit Court \u2013 for lacking the authority to do so under Title I.\n\nDoes pro-Net Neutrality President Obama seek to have Congress rewrite the law to give the FCC the additional authority necessary to impose Net Neutrality? Of course not.\n\nPresident Obama to FCC: Reclassify Broadband Service as Title II to Protect Net Neutrality\n\nBehold \u2013 another Obama fiat. He wants his FCC to impersonate Congress and rewrite the law themselves.\n\nSurely pro-Net Neutrality Democrats in Congress will protect their purview as legislators, right? Of course not.\n\n(Democrat) Senators Urge Congress to Preserve Strong Net Neutrality Protections\n\n\u201cThe FCC can and should take strong action\u2026 We would forcefully oppose any reforms that would undermine the FCC\u2019s authority to act to adopt meaningful net neutrality rules to protect consumers.\u201d\n\nGet that? Democrats say Congress shouldn\u2019t do Congress\u2019 job \u2013 because that would prohibit the FCC from illegally doing Congress\u2019 job.\n\nAs recently as 2010, there were Democrats who were a little more appreciative of the gigs for which they ran. Oh \u2013 and the Constitution.\n\n73 Democrats Tell FCC: Drop Net Neutrality Rules\n\nA slew of House Democrats have sent a letter to the Federal Communications Commission warning the agency not to go forward with its plan to partially reclassify ISPs as common carriers, a move needed to impose net neutrality rules.\n\nMeanwhile, when the FCC contemplates new regulations it is supposed to have a public Comment Period. To allow us to register our discontent \u2013 before they go ahead and power grab anyway.\n\nDemocrat FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler last year proposed a third attempt at Net Neutrality imposition under Title I \u2013 and had two Comment Periods therefore.\n\nThe first was an ObamaCare-website-esque technological disaster.\n\nGovernment Agency That Wants To Commandeer The Internet Just Had Their Website Crash \u2013 Twice\n\nDuring which the FCC played favorites \u2013 helping the Left file their Comments when the website repeatedly went down.\n\nMediaFreedom Asks FCC Inspector General to Look into \u2018Unusual Collaboration\u2019 of FCC Staff and Title II Activists\n\nAnd the second Comment Period was overwhelmingly won by the proponents of Less Government.\n\nThose Opposed to Internet Regulation Won FCC Comment Period by Landslide\n\nDuring which the government\u2019s alleged Web experts yet again couldn\u2019t manage their website.\n\nFCC Somehow \u2018Lost\u2019 Hundreds of Thousands of Net Neutrality Comments\n\nThat\u2019s ok \u2013 Amazon loses hundreds of thousands of orders per month, right?\n\nSince then, best guesses have Chairman Wheeler fundamentally altering the proposal on which we twice Commented. Dramatically expanding the power grab to a Title II reclassification unilateral law-rewrite \u2013 and scheduling a February internal FCC vote without any Comment Period on the new regulations.\n\nThe timing indicates Wheeler does not see the need for more public input on the benefits and drawbacks of using Title II, as earlier reports suggested.\n\nSo during Comment Period Round One the FCC aided and abetted the Left \u2013 because the government\u2019s alleged technical experts repeatedly failed to keep their website up and running.\n\nThe Free Marketeers won Round Two going away \u2013 without any government assistance whatsoever. And it may have been an even bigger blowout \u2013 we don\u2019t know because the government\u2019s \u201cexperts\u201d misplaced nearly a million Comments.\n\nSo while it\u2019s obnoxious and maybe illegal to now blow us off without Comment, we can see why Chairman Wheeler doesn\u2019t want to again open that can of worms. Because \u2013 transparency.\n\nOh \u2013 and the FCC\u2019s unelected bureaucrat voting composition looks absolutely nothing like the newly minted Congress We the People just ensconced. There are five voting FCC Commissioners (one of whom also serves as Chairman). Three are of the President\u2019s Party \u2013 two of the opposing Party. So right now the FCC is 3-2 Democrat.\n\nI wonder how this Internet power grab vote is going to go?\n\nAll elections matter, but some matter more than others. A national election of historic proportions is about to be trumped by an obscure vote by three Democrat regulators. For whom none of us ever voted \u2013 and of whom most of us have never heard.\n\nYet another part of the President\u2019s ongoing effort to fundamentally transform our once-representative republic.\n\n[This first appeared on Red State", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/01/three-unelected-democrat-bureaucrats-are-about-to-overrule-and-override-novembers-election/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bureau.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "Three Unelected Democrat Bureaucrats Are About to Overrule and Override November\u2019s Election"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf6c3\"", "article_summary": "Lots and lots and LOTS of regulations.\nLots and lots and LOTS of money.\nFCC Somehow \u2018Lost\u2019 Hundreds of Thousands of Net Neutrality CommentsThat\u2019s ok \u2013 Amazon loses hundreds of thousands of orders per month, right?\nThose Opposed to Internet Regulation Won FCC Comment Period by LandslideDuring which the government\u2019s alleged Web experts yet again couldn\u2019t manage their website.\nSurely pro-Net Neutrality Democrats in Congress will protect their purview as legislators, right?"}
