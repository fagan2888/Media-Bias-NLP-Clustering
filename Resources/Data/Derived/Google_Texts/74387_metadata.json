Ed Hernandez authored a series of bills making it possible for California optometrists, pharmacists and nurse-practitioners to expand the range of medical services they provide. It would have allowed them to administer vaccines, among other things.\n\n\u201cWe have a huge capacity issue in the state of California,\u201d the Los Angeles-area Democrat said. \u201cAnd this is even pre-Affordable Care Act \u2014 only one-third of the counties meet the national average of primary-care physician-to-patient ratio.\u201d He argued that giving more authority to optometrists and other professions would help more people get the treatment they need.\n\nHernandez would know \u2014 he\u2019s a practicing optometrist.\n\nHe said there\u2019s nothing wrong with putting forward a bill that would expand the scope of his business. And according to California\u2019s conflict-of-interest laws, he\u2019s absolutely right. The way the regulations are written, California lawmakers are free to vote on, or even write, measures that affect the fields in which they work.\n\nHernandez pointed out that he\u2019s taken votes that hurt his practice, like a 2011 measure cutting Medi-Cal payments to providers. \u201cMy wife, when I told her about it, she said, \u2018Well, why\u2019d you do that? You just cut our pay by 10 percent.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, we had to. We had to balance the budget.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNo One\u2019s Declaring Conflicts\n\nHernandez and his optometry practice are just one example of a broad trend within California\u2019s Legislature. The Assembly and Senate are filled with practicing lawyers, real estate agents and business executives of various sorts. Four in 10 legislators bring in some sort of outside income, according to disclosure forms.\n\n\u2018Public officials are making decisions affecting millions, and sometimes billions, of dollars. We want to make sure they don\u2019t have a personal stake different from the stake of the public in making these decisions.\u2019\n\nAnd California\u2019s law says they have a conflict of interest only if they vote on a measure that directly affects their own company or firm. There\u2019s no problem if the bill helps, say, every other optometrist, too. That being the case, it\u2019s been years since a legislator followed the ethics law\u2019s protocols and formally declared a conflict. The Assembly clerk and Senate secretary\u2019s offices can\u2019t remember the last time it happened.\n\nIn the weeks since three Democrats were suspended from the Senate for legal problems, ethics have been front and center in Sacramento. Scores of new bills are being proposed, and legislative staffers have even been going through extra ethics training. But reining in outside income doesn\u2019t appear to be on the reform agenda.\n\nThat\u2019s mostly because California\u2019s conflict-of-interest guidelines are on par with other states. Other full-time legislatures allow outside income, too. And California lawmakers need to disclose all their outside income each year, in more detail than many states require.\n\nBob Stern co-authored California\u2019s Political Reform Act and worked as the top lawyer at the Fair Political Practices Commission. He said there\u2019s a reason why the state requires officials to provide that information. \u201cPublic officials are making decisions affecting millions \u2014 and sometimes billions \u2014 of dollars. And we want to make sure that they don\u2019t have a personal stake different from the stake of the public in making these decisions.\u201d\n\nStern said he\u2019s satisfied with California\u2019s current laws, but he\u2019d like to see the state go a step further. He said the Legislature should follow the lead of Congress and the Los Angeles City Council, and ban members from holding any outside jobs. \u201cBasically raise the pay to a pay that is commensurate to what they\u2019re doing in office. And say, \u2018That\u2019s it,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cYou have to be working full time for the public, and you cannot have any outside earned income.\u201d\n\nThese second jobs have led to questions before.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown was criticized for earning millions of dollars in private law practice and sometimes appointing clients to state boards.\n\nThe top Democrat in the Senate today has worked for law firms, too. But President pro Tem Darrell Steinberg said he has bent over backwards to avoid conflicts, to the detriment of his practice. \u201cIt was very, very difficult because of the time demands on the job that I have. And also, you know, I\u2019m very sensitive to conflicts. And the notion of marketing and that sort of thing, when you\u2019re an elected official, is just very difficult to do.\u201d\n\nThe issue of potential conflicts goes beyond legislators.\n\nGov. Arnold Schwarzenegger came under fire for accepting a magazine consulting gig in 2005. That led to a bill to end these side jobs for statewide officeholders, but the legislation never went anywhere. In fact, Treasurer Bill Lockyer has done outside legal work for years.\n\nReform Groups Have Other Priorities\n\nSo how much of a problem is this? Most elected officials aren\u2019t actually clocking in at second jobs \u2014 they\u2019re earning income from businesses in which they have longtime ownership stakes. And lawmakers argue their outside jobs give them valuable perspective.\n\nThere isn\u2019t exactly a groundswell to change the current set-up. Although Bob Stern wants to eliminate outside jobs, he pointed out there are larger problems to fix first.\n\n\u201cThere are only a handful, or small percentage, of legislators who earn outside income that could be conflicts,\u201d said Stern. \u201cAlmost every legislator earns campaign money from someone who wants something from government. And that, in my mind, is the bigger conflict.\u201d\n\nSo even if recent scandals do lead to ethics reforms in state government, don\u2019t expect this issue to be on the agenda.", "article_metadata": {"description": "State conflict-of-interest law allows legislators to vote on measures affecting the fields they work in.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Four in 10 California Lawmakers Get Outside Income\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/2014\\/04\\/11\\/4-in-10-california-lawmakers-take-in-outside-income\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-04-14 05:50:45\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-04-14 15:04:06\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":132346,\"author_id\":\"256\",\"author_name\":\"Scott Detrow\",\"author_display_name\":\"Scott Detrow\",\"tags\":[\"Arnold Schwarzenegger\",\"Bill Lockyer\",\"California Legislature\",\"Darrell Steinberg\",\"Ed Hernandez\"],\"categories\":[\"Politics and Government\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/10\\/2014\\/04\\/RS1369_IMG_1902-lpr.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "KQED News", "description": "State conflict-of-interest law allows legislators to vote on measures affecting the fields they work in.", "title": "Four in 10 California Lawmakers Get Outside Income", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2014/04/11/4-in-10-california-lawmakers-take-in-outside-income/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2014/04/RS1369_IMG_1902-lpr-640x480.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqednews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "arnold schwarzenegger,bill lockyer,california legislature,darrell steinberg,ed hernandez,government,willie brown", "google-site-verification": "Oam-TnlJjUP-cg8UEyR3-KcLp8_-WTy6_dBaSws1ADA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfbb5\"", "article_summary": "And California lawmakers need to disclose all their outside income each year, in more detail than many states require.\n\u201cThere are only a handful, or small percentage, of legislators who earn outside income that could be conflicts,\u201d said Stern.\nFour in 10 legislators bring in some sort of outside income, according to disclosure forms.\nBut reining in outside income doesn\u2019t appear to be on the reform agenda.\nAlthough Bob Stern wants to eliminate outside jobs, he pointed out there are larger problems to fix first."}
