If the writer and editor have trouble keeping track of the sentence, what hope does a reader have? Pare them down or break them up.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nMr. Inslee [the governor of Washington] argues that in the state of Microsoft and Boeing and where science and technology drive much of the economy, denying the science of climate change is a losing political stance.\n\nThe two phrases modifying \u201cstate\u201d \u2014 \u201cof Microsoft and Boeing\u201d and \u201cwhere science and technology \u2026\u201d \u2014 are not parallel, and so should not be connected by \u201cand.\u201d Replacing \u201cand\u201d with a comma would work.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThe fight over fracking in a swing state that prizes its natural beauty and relies on its energy resources for jobs and tax revenues has become a monthslong headache for Democratic leaders, opening fissures within the party and between pro-energy moderates and environmental groups that want to impose tough limits on the oil and gas rigs sprouting up alongside subdivisions.\n\nUnder the agreement announced Monday, Representative Jared Polis, a millionaire Democrat who has been a leading backer of a campaign to limit drilling, said he would pull his support for two measures that would have prohibited drilling within 2,000 feet of homes and given communities the power to pass tough new rules on energy development in their backyards \u2014 a power now claimed by the state.\n\nTwo successive sentences of over 60 words each, stuffed with multiple clauses and a parade of prepositional phrases. It\u2019s as though we\u2019re daring readers to try to get through them.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nExpress Scripts, a company that manages drug benefits for insurers, prepared a worst-case situation: It said that states alone could be on the hook for up to $55 billion if every Medicaid patient or state prisoner with the disease was treated.\n\nUse the subjunctive for a hypothetical or contrary-to-fact clause like this: \u201cwere treated.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nHere, little unites the lives of the actress Hana (Hannah D. Scott) and the athlete Milos (Saul Reichlin) except their Jewry and the horrors they suffered and witnessed.\n\n\u201cJewry\u201d means the Jewish people collectively. We wanted \u201cJewishness.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n[Video summary] Women keep their clothes loose, lightweight and stick to light colors to stay cool throughout the sweaty New York City summer.\n\nThe three elements are not parallel. Make it \u201ckeep their clothes loose and lightweight, and stick to \u2026\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThe hedge fund firm of billionaire Paul E. Singer has about 300 employees, yet it has managed to force Argentina, a nation of 41 million people, into a position where it now has to contemplate a humbling surrender.\n\n\u201cBillionaire\u201d is a description; don\u2019t use it with the name like this as if it were a title.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nMore than a decade and a half ago, almost no one thought that a feather boa-wearing former professional wrestler could become the governor of Minnesota.\n\nWe needed another hyphen to hold this modifier together: \u201cfeather-boa-wearing.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nRegulators and consumer advocates say the true figure is probably much higher since many victims do not report being ripped off because of the difficulty in prosecuting such cases and the embarrassment of being duped.\n\nNo reason for the slang.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nOver the last few years, pension smoothing has been one of Congress\u2019 favorite fiscal tricks, with members proposing it as a way to pay for all sorts of things: Cutting tax rates. Repealing the tax on medical devices in the Affordable Care Act. Shoring up benefits for coal miners.\n\nMake it \u201cCongress\u2019s favorite fiscal tricks.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThe disagreements surfaced after Wendy R. Sherman, the under secretary of state for policy and the lead American negotiator with Iran, made the case that the four-month-long extension in negotiations agreed to by the administration, along with modest additional sanctions relief, were warranted \u201cbecause we have seen significant progress in the negotiating room.\u201d\n\nThe singular \u201cextension\u201d should have a singular verb, \u201cwas warranted\u201d \u2014 the \u201calong with\u201d phrase is grammatically treated as parenthetical. It\u2019s no wonder the grammar went awry in such a stuffed and convoluted sentence. (Also, the \u201clong\u201d in \u201cfour-month-long extension\u201d is superfluous.)\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nLeaders of the Republican-controlled North Carolina legislature on Tuesday announced details of a tentative budget agreement, including a 7 percent pay raise for teachers in public schools, that could end a monthlong stalemate that has exposed a breach between Republican conservatives and moderates in the state.\n\nMake it \u201ca 7 percent raise.\u201d A raise is understood to be in pay.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nBy then, Jones had gone back to Kentucky, and in November 1953, he won an election to county sheriff.\n\nMake it \u201che won election as county sheriff\u201d or \u201che was elected county sheriff.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nThe beer was for the send-off of a reporter who was leaving the paper after 13 years, adding to dozens of staff members who had left in the previous year, reducing the newsroom to nearly half the size it was five years ago.\n\nThe phrasing is ambiguous. Was it reduced by almost 50 percent, meaning it is now a little more than half of its previous size? Or was it reduced by more than 50 percent, so that it is now \u201cnearly half the size\u201d it once was? Rephrase.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nRowland\u2019s referentiality can feel heavy-handed.\n\nThe word \u201creferentiality\u201d is also likely to feel heavy-handed to many readers.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nStudies have repeatedly shown that participants who are in high positions of power (or who are temporarily induced to feel powerful) are less able to adopt the visual, cognitive or emotional perspective of other people, compared to participants who are powerless (or are made to feel so).\n\nMake it \u201ccompared with.\u201d The groups are being contrasted, rather than likened. The Times\u2019s stylebook says this:\n\ncompare. Use compare to when the intent is to liken things: The book compared the quarterback\u2019s role to the job of a company\u2019s vice president for operations. When the intent is to compare and contrast, or just to contrast, use compare with: They compared Terry\u2019s forecasting with Dana\u2019s, and found Dana more accurate.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n[Headline] Cures for Canines\n\nUsually it\u2019s best to call a dog a dog. As the stylebook says, \u201ccanine\u201d as a noun is trite.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nShe has also helped children prepare their family home for sale, including hiring painters, carpet cleaners and art appraisers or arranging for the Salvation Army or Housing Works to pick up furniture and clothes once a parent has passed away.\n\nNo need for the euphemism. \u201cDied\u201d is perfectly acceptable.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, he enlisted in the Army and completed officers\u2019 training at Ft. Benning, Ga.\n\nThe stylebook says this:\n\nfort. Spell out in news copy and capitalize as part of a name: Fort Hamilton. The abbreviation (Ft.) may be used with the name in a headline, a chart, a list or a map.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nFortuitously for Mr. Ayer, \u201cFury\u201d was born before another of his films, \u201cSabotage,\u201d ran into a wall of resistance from audience and critics alike.\n\nIn precise usage, \u201cfortuitously\u201d means \u201cby chance\u201d; it does not mean \u201cfortunately.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nIt looks like the Mask of Ka-Nefer-Nefer is staying at the St. Louis Art Museum.\n\nMake it \u201cas if.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nGoing forward, if the city does not appeal, its officials will have to decide just what those measures should be.\n\nThis faddish phrase causes groans among readers, and is often entirely superfluous.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140812080012, "twitter": {"url": "http://afterdeadline.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/12/in-a-word-3/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "description": "An extra-large grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled \u2014 as always \u2014 with help from colleagues and readers.", "card": "summary", "title": "In a Word"}, "WT.z_gtn": "Blog", "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000003051507, "DISPLAYDATE": "August 12, 2014", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/afterdeadline/In a Word ( 20140812 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Philip B.
