The teenager was on his way home from a movie when he wrecked.

A Cleveland teen was killed on an icy road early Saturday in Tulsa County. It happened on westbound Highway 412 just east of 177th West Avenue.

Troopers say Brock Norton, 16, called his family to say he was on his way home from Tulsa after seeing a movie. When he did not arrive, his family called authorities.

An Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper found the teen at about 12:45 a.m. His pickup left the highway near Shell Creek, hit a guard rail and went airborne. It rolled once and came to rest down an embankment.

Troopers say the road was wet and icy, and speed was a contributing factor. He was ejected from the truck and was found a several feet away.

"The minor was not wearing a seat belt and was ejected quite a distance from his vehicle," said Trooper Matthew Middleton.

"A seat belt would have been a major contributor to helping him survive this collision."

Middleton said the wreck took place about an hour and a half before troopers discovered the truck.



Norton was taken to a Tulsa hospital where he died of his injuries.
