The ongoing issues within the system demonstrate the need for a deeper re-evaluation of the VA's approach to care delivery, argues an opinion piece by VA Under Secretary of Health David Shulkin, M.D.\n\nThe continual problems with care delivery within the VA demonstrate fundamental weaknesses in how the department is set up compared to other healthcare systems, Shulkin writes for The New England Journal of Medicine. For example, the VA is almost unique in enrolling patients independent of whether they have geographical access to their facilities. This, he writes, is at odds with the system's mission of establishing lifelong relationships with its patients.\n\nShulkin and colleagues in the Commission on Care incorporated these insights and others in developing care delivery recommendations, which it will deliver to President Barack Obama later this year. Their recommendations call for developing a three-part provider network to address many of the VA's ongoing issues. The network's central hub would consist of VA facilities as well as similar government-run facilities and teaching hospitals that have existing relationships with the VA.\n\nThe second network would encompass private providers and delivery systems that meet VA standards, with an exacting, competitive selection process. The third would aim to ensure private-sector care access to veterans with geographical barriers to the other two networks.\n\nThe recommendations also encompass the need to apply best practices to VA care delivery as well as incorporating techniques such as \"lean\" management, which has helped safety-net providers significantly improve outcomes and reduce costs.\n\n\"By rethinking our systems, working with our current partners, and exploring new public-private partnerships, the VA is transitioning from a loose federation of regional systems to a highly integrated enterprise,\" Shulkin writes.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the opinion piece\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nVA scandal: Heads finally roll as Phoenix VA Health System fires three\n\nVA OIG still hasn't released months-old reports into wait-time scandal\n\nVA scandal: Internal investigations neglected whistleblower concerns\n\nVA troubles mount: Audit reveals department failed to spend $1.9B on healthcare\n\nVA scandal: Continued care access problems at Oklahoma facility reflect national concerns\n\nVA scandal: Department unveils plan to consolidate private doc networks\n\nVA paid $142M in bonuses during the year of scandal\n\nVA scandal: Claims that higher pay would improve care may not hold water", "article_metadata": {"description": "Problems within the Department of Veterans Affairs keep coming even amid efforts to reform the system, with allegations this week that Texas VA facilities engaged in similar record falsification to that which kicked off the scandal nearly two years ago.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Problems within the Department of Veterans Affairs keep coming even amid efforts to reform the system, with allegations this week that Texas VA facilities engaged in similar record falsification to that which kicked off the scandal nearly two years ago.", "title": "Scandal pushes officials to redesign the VA healthcare delivery system", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/scandal-pushes-officials-redesign-va-healthcare-delivery-system/2016-03-17", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,healthcare access,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,VA scandal,Veterans Affairs", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management"}, "article_summary": "The network's central hub would consist of VA facilities as well as similar government-run facilities and teaching hospitals that have existing relationships with the VA.\nThe second network would encompass private providers and delivery systems that meet VA standards, with an exacting, competitive selection process.\nShulkin and colleagues in the Commission on Care incorporated these insights and others in developing care delivery recommendations, which it will deliver to President Barack Obama later this year.\nThe continual problems with care delivery within the VA demonstrate fundamental weaknesses in how the department is set up compared to other healthcare systems, Shulkin writes for The New England Journal of Medicine.\nThe ongoing issues within the system demonstrate the need for a deeper re-evaluation of the VA's approach to care delivery, argues an opinion piece by VA Under Secretary of Health David Shulkin, M.D."}
