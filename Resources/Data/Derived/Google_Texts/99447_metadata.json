Different varieties and brands of food capture our attention, each with their own cocktail of ingredients and defining labels.\n\nMany of the labels we see on food today include organic, gluten-free, all natural, and free range. But plenty of people create associations for these words without truly knowing what they stand for. In addition, there\u2019s a different certification and regulation process for each of these labels, with some more strictly regulated than others. Below are explanations behind 8 common food labels that can improve your food shopping experience, and help you decipher which labels are important, and which are too loosely defined to mean much.\n\nOrganic\n\nThis is perhaps the most common food label we see nowadays, automatically sparking the notion that a food labelled with it must mean it\u2019s healthier (albeit slightly more expensive). But what does \u201corganic\u201d really stand for?\n\nOrganic food labels are more tightly regulated by the USDA than most other labels: they must consist of at least 95 percent \u201corganically produced ingredients.\u201d The other 5 percent must be on the National List created by the USDA. Organically produced ingredients may not involve the following things: antibiotics, growth hormones, pesticides, petroleum or sewage-sludge based fertilizers, bioengineering, or ionizing radiation. In order to have a product labeled organic, producers must submit an application for certification, providing the USDA with history of ingredients for the past three years. The USDA will also inspect production sites along with annual and unannounced inspections post-certification. Whether organic foods are more healthy than regular foods is to be debated.\n\nNatural\n\n\u201cNatural\u201d is a loose term for products that are not allowed to contain artificial ingredients or preservatives, according to the USDA definition. The ingredients inside \u201cnatural\u201d foods are \u201cminimally processed,\u201d meaning they were not altered on a fundamental level. \u201cProcessed is code for \u2018junk\u2019 foods \u2014 foods of minimal nutritional value,\u201d Marion Nestle, nutrition and public policy expert, told SFGate. \u201cThese crowd the center aisles of supermarkets, add loads of unneeded calories, rely on added nutrients for health benefits, last forever on the shelves and generate enormous profits for their makers.\u201d Minimally processed usually involves washing, aging, drying, freezing, canning, pasteurizing, or cooking the food; but actual processing changes foods \u2014 by adding fat and sugar calories, salt, colors, flavors, and various other substances to make the food taste better while reducing nutritional value.\n\nFoods with the \u201cnatural\u201d label, however, are not very closely regulated \u2014 so go for organic instead, since most organic foods will be minimally processed.\n\nLocal\n\nThough this can be a loose term, \u201clocal\u201d or locally grown usually pertains to the location from which the food product was made and produced; the USDA defines it as \u201crelated to the distance between food producers and consumers,\u201d and \u201cdefined in terms of social and supply chain characteristics.\u201d Local is not regulated or officially defined \u2014 some locavores (people who strictly eat food from their local or regional food supply) define local as having a distance of 100 miles from farm to table, while Whole Foods defines it as 200 miles. Locally grown food is frequently organic.\n\nSustainable\n\nSustainable typically refers to economic qualities rather than nutritional qualities of food, and it\u2019s quite a loose term that can be interpreted in different ways, depending on who you ask. \u201cSustainable agriculture\u201d was defined by Congress in the 1990 \u201cFarm Bill,\u201d in which it was associated with being safe and enhancing for the environment, and efficient in terms of resources and integrating natural biological cycles. \u201cIn our experience the most sustainable food producers are family farmers and the family-owned businesses that have a personal connection to the land they work and the food they create,\u201d Dr. John Salerno, a food writer, writes on the Huffington Post. \u201cThe best family farmers and ranchers see themselves as stewards of the land. They want that land to be healthy and productive when they pass it on to a new generation.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201cBig, corporate agribusinesses run factory-style farms with a hard eye toward reducing the costs of production.\u201d\n\nFree Range\n\nFood products labelled \u201cfree range\u201d or \u201ccage free\u201d pertains to those created from animals that are not allowed to be contained in any way, and must be allowed to wander freely over open areas of land. However, because this particular label isn\u2019t closely regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and no applications or certification are required, producers still use the label freely even if the animals are tightly confined \u2014 as long as they don\u2019t use cages. Another term, \u201cgrass fed,\u201d is not quite the same as free range but typically refers to animals that are frequently allowed to roam and graze in unconfined areas; however, by definition, grass fed refers to animals allowed to graze rather than be \u201cgrain fed,\u201d meaning it was raised in a feedlot and consists of lower nutritional value.\n\nGluten-Free\n\nThe FDA issued a \u201cgluten-free\u201d food label in 2013 that would assist the 3 million people in America who suffer from celiac disease and are unable to consume gluten. Foods containing gluten will trigger antibodies in people with the disease that will attack the small intestine. Though \u201cgluten-free\u201d foods have become somewhat trendy, people who are capable of eating gluten will not nutritionally benefit from gluten-free foods.\n\nGMO-Free\n\nCurrently, the FDA does not require food producers to label products containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) \u2014 and the debate over that decision continues. Many claim that GMOs are harmful and ought to be removed from food, or at least labelled, while giant food corporations like Coca-Cola and Kraft are pouring millions into lobbyists to defeat bills aimed at labelled GMOs in products.\n\nGMOs are the consequence of a production process that places genes from one species into the genes of another to create a more desirable product. Since most food won\u2019t label whether it contains GMOs or not, look for foods that contain this seal. In addition, most organic foods aren\u2019t allowed to contain GMOs.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "organic foods, food labelling", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Before you shop for healthy food, be sure you understand what all those product labels stand for, from organic to sustainable to free range.", "title": "7 Common Food Labels Demystified", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/truth-behind-these-7-common-food-labels-and-why-you-should-know-difference-289294", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/21/nutritional-value.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Before you shop for healthy food, be sure you understand what all those product labels stand for, from organic to sustainable to free range.", "title": "7 Common Food Labels Demystified", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/truth-behind-these-7-common-food-labels-and-why-you-should-know-difference-289294", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/21/nutritional-value.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/21/nutritional-value.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-06-21T17:07:33-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-21T17:16:12-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Before you shop for healthy food, be sure you understand what all those product labels stand for, from organic to sustainable to free range."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca363\"", "article_summary": "Below are explanations behind 8 common food labels that can improve your food shopping experience, and help you decipher which labels are important, and which are too loosely defined to mean much.\n\u201cProcessed is code for \u2018junk\u2019 foods \u2014 foods of minimal nutritional value,\u201d Marion Nestle, nutrition and public policy expert, told SFGate.\nOrganicThis is perhaps the most common food label we see nowadays, automatically sparking the notion that a food labelled with it must mean it\u2019s healthier (albeit slightly more expensive).\nGMO-FreeCurrently, the FDA does not require food producers to label products containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) \u2014 and the debate over that decision continues.\nWhether organic foods are more healthy than regular foods is to be debated."}
