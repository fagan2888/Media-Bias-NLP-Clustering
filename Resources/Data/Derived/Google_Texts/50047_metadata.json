Here\u2019s your answer, \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown: Your Guide to Living Through the Disaster of Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are even more far removed from reality today, as markets responded to consumer demand and have already lowered the amount of trans-fat in food,\u201d he said in his statement. \u201cThe FDA\u2019s scary assumptions are based on wobbly models piled on top of wishful thinking and doused with junk science.\u201d\n\nThe FDA originally brought forth its trans-fat phaseout idea in late 2013 but is expected to finalize its regulatory curbs as soon as Monday. The agency is expected to boot trans-fats from its \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d category, which will require any company that wants to use them to first petition the for FDA approval, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAmong the foods containing trans-fats: Commercially baked goods, microwave pizza and fried foods.\n\nStier said the little trans-fats that are used nowadays, like in microwave popcorn, ice cream sprinkles and some restaurant biscuits, \u201care there because they serve a specific function.\u201d\n\nHe went on: \u201cFor instance, trans-fats are stable for a longer period of time, so a ban on even the most narrow uses of trans-fats will undoubtedly lead to more expensive food and more food waste.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "The Food and Drug Administration is poised to announce new bans on artificial trans-fats, and regulatory watchdogs are warning: The nanny state is alive and thriving. \u201cHold onto your salt-shaker,\u201d said Jeff Stier, director of Risk Analysis with the National Center for Public Policy Research, in a written statement. \u201cThere\u2019s more to come from this [\u2026]", "title": "Nanny FDA poised to ban trans-fats", "url": "http://www.wnd.com/2015/06/nanny-fda-poised-to-ban-trans-fats/", "image": "http://www.wnd.com/files/2015/06/Food.png", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 152299868169938}, "google-site-verification": "5iw1bKISvQcI1qRwIskRfer6GKV4jUf6LImfS9bhaeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Food and Drug Administration is poised to announce new bans on artificial trans-fats, and regulatory watchdogs are warning: The nanny state is alive and thriving.\n\u201cHold onto your salt-shaker,\u201d said Jeff Stier, director of Risk Analysis with the National Center for Public Policy Research, in a written statement.\nAmong the foods containing trans-fats: Commercially baked goods, microwave pizza and fried foods.\nThe agency is expected to boot trans-fats from its \u201cgenerally recognized as safe\u201d category, which will require any company that wants to use them to first petition the for FDA approval, the Associated Press reported.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more to come from this administration."}
