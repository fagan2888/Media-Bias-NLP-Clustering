Scott Walker, in his soaring and often unpredictable campaign that has largely targeted frontrunners but spared essentially nobody.\n\n\u201cHis state has not performed well,\u201d Trump, the billionaire businessman who now leads in most polls, told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cWe need someone who\u2019s going to make it perform well, this country perform well. \u2026 I\u2019m the one to do it.\u201d\n\nLike many political candidates, Trump is spending the early part of the election cycle trying to downgrade the early favorites -- in this case Republican Jeb Bush, a former Florida governor, and Democrat Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state.\n\nStill, Walker, another early favorite who remains a top-tier contender, was more than willing to block and tackle, telling ABC later in the morning that Trump sounds like a Democrat when attack his record as a two-term governor.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s using the talking points of the Democrats,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t work in the past. They\u2019re not going to work now.\u201d\n\nTrump essentially said he was unconcerned about the campaign for Walker, who trails Trump and Bush in an averaging of polls by the nonpartisan website RealClearPolitics.com.\n\n2016 Election Headquarters The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage \u2192\n\nHe argued that Wisconsin has a $2.2 billion deficit, instead of an anticipated $1 billion surplus and that Walker has been forced to borrow money instead of raising taxes to keep state projects going.\n\nTrump argued that people\u2019s realization about Wisconsin\u2019s situation is reflected in Walker\u2019s declining polls numbers.\n\nWalker, who began a second term is January, disagreed by saying the state\u2019s roads and schools have improved under his leadership.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged the voter frustration into which Trump and other first-time candidates have tapped, albeit misdirected at him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s why you see not only (Trump\u2019s) numbers up, you see some of the other candidates who have not run for office before,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThey\u2019re angry at Washington. Heck, I\u2019m angry at Washington. I\u2019m angry at my own party\u2019s leadership, who told us there were going to repeal ObamaCare and we still don\u2019t see a bill on the desk of the president.\u201d\n\nTrump has also attacked Clinton, suggesting that her email controversy has put her campaign in jeopardy; Bush for comments about federal spending on women's heath care and even fellow GOP candidate and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Trump suggested Perry stared wearing eye glasses to look smarter. Perry's polls numbers are at about 1.5 percent, among the lowest of the top 17 GOP candidates.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/ELECTIONS/Republicans", "dcterms.modified": "2015-08-23 03:25:26 EDT", "dcterms.abstract": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump on Sunday turned his attack on rival Wisconsin Gov.
