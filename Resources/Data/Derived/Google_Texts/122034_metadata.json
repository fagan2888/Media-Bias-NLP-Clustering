Many voters are directing that anger at \u201cthe establishment\u201d \u2014 an overused term that\u2019s come to mean whatever the user chooses. I\u2019ve tried, unsuccessfully, to find out what people using it mean.\n\nIt seems to refer to whoever is in office, in power, or controlling the party, the policy or the money. There\u2019s no attempt to differentiate among current officeholders based on their records or actions. Those unhappy with \u201cthe establishment\u201d tend to lump them all together.\n\nNo, it\u2019s not rational or well thought out \u2014 it\u2019s a primal reaction to frustration and a feeling of helplessness. At least that\u2019s what the political pundits say when pointing to the surprising and meteoric rise of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders \u2014 two outsiders who want to fundamentally change politics in their parties. Ironically, neither really is of the party whose presidential nomination he is seeking.\n\nTrump, a pragmatic businessman, has historically given campaign contributions to candidates of both parties and embraces issues that don\u2019t fit neatly in Republican ideology. Supporters find it refreshing; opponents brand him a fake Republican.\n\nBut he\u2019s tapped into their anger; he embraces their enemies as his and he channels their rage into a call to arms. Trump has become their hero, their pillar of hope and their fighter-in-chief. They\u2019re convinced they\u2014and the country\u2014can\u2019t win without him\u2014contrary to general election polls.\n\nDisgruntled Republicans\u2014upset for different and sometimes conflicting reasons\u2014are somehow uniting in his camp. He\u2019s managed to attract an eclectic mix of supporters with diverse views and ideologies\u2014independents, liberals, moderates, conservatives, tea partiers and some evangelicals.\n\nIt\u2019s odd since other candidates are scrutinized more on their policy positions, voting record and ideological consistency while Trump is given a pass on his vacillating positions.\n\nOf the 17 Republican candidates that entered the primary \u2014 touted as the best field ever \u2014 only three remain.\n\nTrump, the frontrunner, is the outsider who\u2019s been on the periphery of the political arena but never in it. A successful New York businessman and reality TV star, Trump is well known around the country. His self-proclaimed lack of political correctness immediately resonated with Republican voters who were weary and divided and searching for something to rally around.\n\nIn a strong, but distant second, is Ted Cruz, the ultra-conservative U.S. senator from Texas, who demagogues, divides, throws fellow Republicans under the bus, dishes out red meat better than a butcher and forces a government shutdown just to show how much he hates Obamacare.\n\nCruz, not likely to win a popularity contest among his congressional colleagues, is nonetheless getting the backing\u2014at least temporarily\u2014of the dreaded establishment in their frantic effort to stop Trump. How incredibly bizarre that he would seek and they would give that support.\n\nAt one point they struggled to determine who they disliked the least\u2014Trump or Cruz. Looks like they settled on Cruz. They may come to regret that decision.\n\nWhile they fear they can\u2019t control either man, Cruz\u2014not known to be a team player\u2014is shrewd, calculating and has shown a willingness to blow things up rather than compromise. Trump, on the other hand, is the consummate dealmaker\u2014ready to negotiate. Unbound by rigid ideology, he might be able to cross party lines and party factions for meaningful reforms. But his thin skin and incendiary rhetoric might prove to be obstacles too big for him to win or effectively govern.\n\nOdd man out is Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who served in the U.S. Congress and chaired the House Budget Committee. He was the last budget chief to balance a federal budget. He did so in bipartisan fashion with President Bill Clinton. Kasich, popular in the purple state of Ohio\u2014a must-win in the general election\u2014is the only candidate who wins consistently in general election matchups with the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton.\n\nHe stays above the fray in the debates and on the campaign trail and focuses on unity and working together. While not terribly exciting or flashy, he has a solid record. He\u2019s the favorite of newspaper editorial boards, where he is racking up glowing endorsements.\n\nYet Republican primary voters aren\u2019t interested.\n\nWhat are they thinking? They\u2019re not following the conventional logic\u2014nominate the one most likely to win in November.\n\nHow this will end is anybody\u2019s guess.\n\nPaula Dockery is a syndicated columnist who served in the Florida Legislature for 16 years as a Republican from Lakeland.
