Three members from the Better Business Bureau\u2019s Alaska, Oregon and western Washington region spoke on how to identify these scams and what to do about them.\n\n\u201cIdentity theft is a widespread problem, and the thieves look for names, addresses and phone numbers, birth dates, mother\u2019s maiden name, passwords and PINs, credit card and bank account numbers, and the holy grail, which is Social Security numbers,\u201d said Michelle Tabler, Alaska Regional Manager of BBB.\n\nWith so many ways to track and steal an identity, your identity has become easier to steal, especially with the ever-growing presence of social media. Surprisingly, the most used social media site to get information is Ancestry.com.\n\n\u201cThink about it,\u201d said Tabler. \u201cYou have your name on there, your mother\u2019s maiden name, your date of birth, where you were born, what your kids names are, and that\u2019s also used for the \u2018grandparent scam.\u2019\u201d\n\nOnce an identity thief has your information, they can do almost anything \u2014 open checking and savings accounts, gain access to actual accounts, establish a new line of credit, change your address and receive your mail, and they can obtain medical treatment.\n\nMedical identity theft was the leading cause of fraud in the U.S. last year.\n\nIn Alaska, the most common form of identity theft and fraud, about 44 percent of all fraud, is done through government documents, or Permanent Fund Dividend checks.\n\nThough people of all ages are susceptible to identity theft, even children as young as 16 years old \u2014 16,000 child identity thefts were reported last year \u2014 have had their credit stolen.\n\nThe most-targeted age group is those over 50 years old. More than one-third of all victims of fraud are in the age group, which makes Florida the No. 1 state of most reported fraud cases. Alaska sat at No. 45 in 2012.\n\n\u201cThey prey on the elderly because they\u2019re much easier to confuse and take advantage of,\u201d said Tabler. \u201cThey\u2019re less likely to report fraud because they\u2019re embarrassed or don\u2019t know where to go for help. And if they do report fraud, they\u2019re less likely to remember details.\u201d\n\nBecause of this, banks have increased their anti-fraud efforts. One of the classic scams is the \u201cgrandparent scam.\u201d That\u2019s when a grandparent receives a phone call in the middle of the night and their grandchild is in jail in Mexico and needs money wired to him right away.\n\nThe most common scams come in via email. A Nigerian prince contacts you for money, for example, or someone sends you an email because you \u201cwon\u201d the lottery. Some scams are less obvious, such as a seemingly innocent email that gives the option to \u201cunsubscribe.\u201d\n\nUnsubscribing actually does the opposite, confirming to the person on the other end that yours is an active address. The best thing to do, with any unfamiliar address, is to ignore it. These rules also apply to smartphone users: Phones are not immune to scams and data breaches.\n\nSome of the other common scams include phishing emails that ask customers to verify information; Affordable Care Act scams targeted at the elderly to update information regarding Medicare; arrest warrant scams, calling people and asking them to pay their fine over the phone so they won\u2019t be arrested (Hint: The police do not call if there\u2019s a warrant); Microsoft tech support, requesting customers provide login and password info and with the help of their credit card information, the problem can be fixed over the phone.\n\nWith the ability to gather important and private information from people over the Internet, it\u2019s important to stay informed and recognize if something doesn\u2019t seem right. Some of the best things to do are to keep track of credit card and telephone charges, check your credit score every couple of months \u2014 annualcreditreport.com allows three free scores per year \u2014 and shred important documents.\n\nThough Internet scams get attention, the most common identity theft is still by physical means, explained Tabler. For those who use mail boxes and raise the red flag for the mailman, it\u2019s also sending a metaphorical red flag to a thief.\n\nAs a resource to help identify credible companies, the BBB outlines businesses that are accredited and customer rated as being satisfactory.\n\nFor more information about scams, visit www.bbb.org/alaskaoregonwesternwashington/.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Juneau, newspaper, news, legislature, capital, Mendenhall, Douglas, southeast, Douglas Island, Gastineau Channel, Mendenhall Glacier, Auke Bay, Salmon Creek, Lemon Creek, Switzer Creek, Mendenhall Valley, Fritz Cove, Lynn Canal, Tee Harbor, Local, ALLIE NIELSON, Michelle Tabler, Kake, Empire, juneauempire, juneauempire.com, Outdoors, Weather, All access, e-edition, iPad, Sports, Real Estate, Jobs, Cars, Homes, Art, Arts & Culture, Neighbors", "og": {"site_name": "Juneau Empire - Alaska's Capital City Online Newspaper", "description": "Identity theft, fraud and scams were the topic of discussion at the Juneau Chamber of Commerce luncheon on Thursday.", "title": "Chamber discusses new scams and identity theft", "url": "http://juneauempire.com/local/2014-06-06/chamber-discusses-new-scams-and-identity-theft", "image": "http://juneauempire.com/sites/default/files/13426758.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Find the latest news, crime, weather, business and community information from juneauempire.com and the Juneau Empire."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbdcd\"", "article_summary": "Identity theft, fraud and scams were the topic of discussion at the Juneau Chamber of Commerce luncheon on Thursday.\nAnd if they do report fraud, they\u2019re less likely to remember details.\u201dBecause of this, banks have increased their anti-fraud efforts.\nThough Internet scams get attention, the most common identity theft is still by physical means, explained Tabler.\nMedical identity theft was the leading cause of fraud in the U.S. last year.\nThe most common scams come in via email."}
