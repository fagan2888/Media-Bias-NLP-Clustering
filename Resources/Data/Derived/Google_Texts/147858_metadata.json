So who\u2019s to blame \u2014 Washington or ourselves?\n\nAbout 10 million Americans, including 1 million in Texas, get health insurance through the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act. Those customers, along with the expansion of Medicaid in most states, added $86 billion in annual revenue for insurers nationwide.\n\nUnfortunately for them, most of the business has been a money-loser. And Texas\u2019 largest insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, has been hit hard \u2014 over twice as hard, in fact.\n\nThe Texas unit lost almost $400 million on exchange business in 2014, the ACA\u2019s first full year. That comes to a loss of about $360 per member, based on rate filings with regulators. That compares with an average loss of $163 per member for insurers nationwide, according to an estimate by McKinsey & Co.\n\nListen to Mitch Schnurman\u2019s interview with Texas Standard on why health care companies are losing money in Texas.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of insurers lost money on the exchange in 2014 and their financial struggles are continuing. A Goldman Sachs analyst, who evaluated the Blues in 30 states, projects an aggregate loss for the not-for-profit plans in 2015. It would be their first loss since the 1980s, and exchange claims are the key driver, wrote Matthew Borsch.\n\nResults were so bad that Blue Cross Texas dropped its PPO for the individual market. Then it raised rates almost 19 percent for its exchange HMOs in 2016, and adjusted the prescription formulary and co-pays.\n\nScott & White Health Plan, which entered the Dallas market last year, underestimated claims, too. It raised 2016 premiums by 32 to 34 percent.\n\nFor years, Texas\u2019 uninsured rate has led the nation. As more residents get coverage for the first time, they\u2019re incurring big bills, said Dr. Dan McCoy, chief medical officer for Blue Cross Texas.\n\nHe cited high obesity rates, which contribute to diabetes and other chronic conditions. Prescription spending has grown sharply. In addition, Texas has had a wave of consolidation among hospitals and doctors, giving providers more clout in payment negotiations. Texas also had a big increase in free standing emergency rooms and urgent care centers, which are more expensive than care from primary doctors.\n\n\u201cEvery one of these issues adds to the total costs,\u201d McCoy said.\n\nBlue Cross Texas also was more ambitious than most insurers, offering exchange coverage in every Texas county. And its PPO \u2013 serving about 367,000 statewide \u2014 had many more health providers, including teaching hospitals such as UT Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nThat access led to a rush in organ transplants and other high-dollar procedures, such as knee replacements, cancer treatment and dialysis. Next year, Blue Cross will offer only HMOs on the exchange, and most have no out-of-network benefits.\n\nThat\u2019s the trend around the country, as insurers narrow their exchange networks in an effort to rein in costs.\n\nTexas has been singled out in the past for high health spending. In 2009, Atul Gawande reported that McAllen was one of the nation\u2019s most expensive health care markets, with Medicare spending per capita running twice the U.S. average.\n\nWhy? \u201cJust look around,\u201d one person said. \u201cPeople are not healthy here.\u201d\n\nMcAllen had sharply higher rates of poverty, drinking and obesity, Gawande wrote in The New Yorker. But other public health statistics didn\u2019t support the explanation. Rates of cardiovascular disease were lower than average, as were rates of asthma, H.I.V., infant mortality, cancer and injury.\n\nGawande quoted one unnamed surgeon: \u201cThere is overutilization here, pure and simple,\u201d he said. Patients in McAllen got more diagnostic tests, hospital treatment, surgery and home care.\n\nHealth economist John Goodman had a different take. He said providers shifted costs to government payers because so many residents were uninsured. While Texas ranked near the top for per-capita spending on Medicare, it ranked near the bottom on private health spending, he co-wrote in a Health Affairs blog in 2013.\n\nOne reason for big losses on the exchange, he said on Monday, is that more people are gaming the system. The health law has many exceptions for penalties and enrollment, allowing folks to sign up only if they get sick.\n\n\u201cIn Massachusetts, they used to call \u2018em jumpers and dumpers,\u201d Goodman said, referring to the state health plan that was the model for the ACA.\n\nIndeed, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina cited the exit of healthy members in its rate review. \u201cWe are seeing customers who use fewer and less expensive services cancel their plans and stop paying premiums,\u201d the company wrote.\n\nThat\u2019s not the main problem, though. The insurer expected a jump in claims from pent-up demand as people got insurance, but \u201cthat demand has not leveled off as expected,\u201d it wrote.\n\nSpending on diabetes care, for instance, increased by a third in the first half of 2015. Initially, the North Carolina unit requested a premium increase of almost 18 percent. It was granted an increase of 32.5 percent.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL2JpemJlYXRibG9nLmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tLzIwMTUvMTIvYWNhLWdyb3dpbmctcGFpbnMtbG9zc2VzLWZvci1ibHVlLWNyb3NzLWJsdWUtc2hpZWxkLW9mLXRleGFzLWFyZS1vdmVyLXR3aWNlLXRoZS11LXMtYXZlcmFnZS5odG1sLw==", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Mitchell Schnurman", "og": {"site_name": "Biz Beat Blog", "description": "Even Obamacare losses are bigger in Texas.
