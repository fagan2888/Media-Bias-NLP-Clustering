The Plantation couple has been married 30 years, and have five kids. They\u2019ve built a foundation of strength, and they need it more than ever now.\n\nTwo years ago, about to turn 50, a bad back injury for Mike Driscoll spiraled into something much worse.\n\n\u201cI was in a tremendous amount of pain and part of during that time while I was in pain, I unfortunately let my heart rate go up to very high levels,\u201d explained Driscoll.\n\nCLICK HERE To Watch Rick Folbaum\u2019s Report\n\nMike Driscoll had a series of mini strokes which lead to fluid on the brain.\n\nSoon, in between jobs and with a pre-existing condition, the only health insurance he qualified for was through the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. And the only way he could afford it was with the federal subsidies Obamacare offers to those in financial need. For the Driscoll\u2019s that is $841 dollars a month.\n\n\u201cWithout the subsidy we would not have been able to afford it,\u201d insisted Carole Driscoll. \u201cI would lose my husband without the subsidy without the insurance, without the pre-existing condition. He wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\n\nBut the Driscolls are among the one million Floridians who will lose those subsidies, if the U.S. Supreme Court sides with Obamacare\u2019s critics. A case on the court\u2019s docket would deprive subsidies to people who live in states, like Florida, that don\u2019t have state run exchanges. Florida doesn\u2019t have one because Gov. Rick Scott and the republican lead state legislature don\u2019t like the law and have refused to set one up.\n\nRepublican State Sen. Rene Garcia says he\u2019s for a state run exchange, to keep those federal subsidies coming.\n\n\u201cThis will fall on the shoulders of taxpayers of the state of Florida if those subsidies disappear,\u201d Garcia said.\n\nFor the Driscolls, Obamacare is the difference between health insurance or no health insurance. And mike, who at 52 thought he was years from retirement, needs expensive brain surgery \u2013 soon.\n\n\u201cI want nothing more than to work full-time,\u201d Mike Driscoll said as he began to tear up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Carole Driscoll reassured her husband. \u201cGo back to where we were.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he told CBS4\u2019s Rick Folbaum.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Folbaum assured him.\n\nMike Driscoll, through tears, insisted that all he wanted was \u201cto work full-time, and have, you know benefits, and just live, live my life as a normal person.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd not have to deal with all this other nonsense?\u201d asked Folbaum.\n\n\u201cNot have to bother with it,\u201d agreed Driscoll.\n\n\u201cThat would be nice,\u201d said Folbaum.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do everything in my power to make that happen,\u201d Mike Driscoll declared.\n\nIf the Supreme Court rules the subsidies must end, lawmakers in Tallahassee and elsewhere are going to start hearing more stories like the Driscoll\u2019s.\n\nThe court is set to hear the Obamacare case early next month and should rule on it by the end of June.\n\nSo state lawmakers still have time to act, if they choose.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After its very rocky roll out, Obamacare is taking off.
