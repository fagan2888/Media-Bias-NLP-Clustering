They didn\u2019t have to\u2014the bulk of their patient populations didn\u2019t have much in the way of choice.\n\nBut as more and more patients have become insured, these providers are having to market their services to remain competitive for the first time. While some are having difficulty finding their footing, others anticipated this eventuality years before Obamacare became law and are meeting the challenge head-on.\n\n\u201cThere are new pressures to retain our traditional patient population while we seek to engage the newly insured and patients who have traditionally had choice,\u201d says Jerri Applegate Randrup, director of corporate communications and marketing for Alameda Health System in Oakland, CA.\n\n\u201cService area competitors now target isolated patient profiles that fit their service model within the ACA expansion, known as \u2018the exchange\u2019 in California. We also have the challenge of proving our service model to our historical base while introducing ourselves to a large part of the community that had no previous connection with us.\u201d\n\nAHS and Kern Medical, a safety-net hospital in Bakersfield, CA, overcame these barriers with the help of AMF Media Group, a San Ramon, CA-agency that has been working with safety-net providers to create their first real marketing strategies.\n\n\u201cThe world has completely changed in this segment\u2014public hospitals no longer have protected patient populations,\u201d says Vintage Foster, president of AMF. \u201cBecause of their history as a safety net provider, they were never associated with quality of care. This is ironic because they have great care providers, are teaching institutions, and often lead their respective markets in critical service areas.\u201d\n\nAlameda Health System\n\nTwo years before Obamacare was signed into law, Alameda health System began working with AMF to conduct research so that it would be ready for the future environment and the challenges that would come with it.\n\n\u201cThe situation required a new message and timing forced rapid implementation to get our messaging in place,\u201d Randrup says. \u201cWe confirmed our strengths and weaknesses through the research, which drove our objectives, including a platform to build upon these insights and position ourselves as a premier healthcare service provider.\u201d\n\nWhile AHS had run some traditional advertising in the past, the efforts were limited. The new environment required better thinking around the health system\u2019s channels, improved targeting for reach, and greater frequency.\n\nWith AMF\u2019s help, they ran a fully integrated campaign, utilizing TV, out-of-home, transit, radio, digital, social media, and an enhanced web presence.\n\nThe effort, which launched in the fall of 2013, made great inroads with improving the health system\u2019s reputation. In one year, AHS saw brand awareness increase by 40% and brand affiliation as a place of last resort dropped by 14%. Web traffic increased by 148% and its community health program grew from 7.14% to 8.3%. Furthermore, positive media coverage increased by 65%.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New pressures to retain traditional patient populations while capturing the newly insured are prompting some safety net hospitals to launch marketing campaigns for the very first time.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "keywords": "marketing, business, finance, management", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Why and How Safety Net Hospitals are Marketing ThemselvesNew pressures to retain traditional patient populations while capturing the newly insured are prompting some safety net hospitals to launch marketing campaigns for the very first time.\nBefore the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, safety-net hospitals didn\u2019t spend much time or money on marketing and advertising.\nThey didn\u2019t have to\u2014the bulk of their patient populations didn\u2019t have much in the way of choice.\n\u201cThe world has completely changed in this segment\u2014public hospitals no longer have protected patient populations,\u201d says Vintage Foster, president of AMF.\n\u201cBecause of their history as a safety net provider, they were never associated with quality of care."}
