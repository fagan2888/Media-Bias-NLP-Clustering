Moment the glass shattered at the Wichita Thunder vs. Quad City Mallards game

Wichita Media released that at the start of the third during the Thunder hockey game between the Mallards, a collision between Todd Fiddler and Theo Peckham in the left corner near the zamboni entrance caused the glass to shatter that delayed the game for several minutes.

Peckham had to be taken into the dressing room for medical attention while the arena staff took care of the fans that were sitting near the boards.

Nobody was sent to the hospital. EMS personnel responded quickly to the situation treating minor cuts. Some stitches needed for Peckham and one of the injured fans.

The play resumed after everyone was treated and the glass was cleaned up and replaced.

Quad City won by the final score of 3-1 over Wichita Thunder.
