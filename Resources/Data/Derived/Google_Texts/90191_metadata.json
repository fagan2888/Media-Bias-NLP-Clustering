Doyle wrote in his conclusion that the word is not sexual or excretory, therefore it does not fall under the definition of what the commission considers profane.\n\nIn his claim, Banzhaf also argues the word 'Redskin' is hate speech, but Doyle wrote the commission has no rules banning hate speech.\n\nBanzhaf told reporter Brooks Boliek at Politico he will continue his effort to see that the R-word is banned from the airwaves.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got quite a number of options we\u2019re still looking at,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to sit down with some of my colleagues and see where we go from here.
