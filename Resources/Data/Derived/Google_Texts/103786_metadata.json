White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest played up McDonald\u2019s management history when asked about the appointment during Monday\u2019s press briefing.\n\nRelated: McDonald\u2019s VA \u2018To-Do List\u2019 Includes 6 Urgent Fixes\n\n\u201cMr. McDonald was principally chosen because he has the kind of record as a solid manager that will be required of the next Secretary of the Veterans Affairs Department to put in place the reforms that are needed,\u201d Earnest said, in part. \u201cThose management chops are going to be critical to his success, and they\u2019re going to be critical to ensuring that our country lives up to the commitment that we\u2019ve made to our men and women in uniform.\u201d\n\nEarnest also praised what he called McDonald\u2019s history of fostering mentorship and leadership among middle-managers. \u201cHaving the kind of management style that inspires other people in an organization to assume leadership skills is something that, based on the problems have been unearthed at the VA, will be really critical to their success over there as well,\u201d he said.\n\nA strong business background doesn\u2019t always translate to success in cutting through the red tape and politics that so often come with being part of the federal bureaucracy, though. \u201cIt\u2019s a mixed record,\u201d said Steve Kelman, professor of public management at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. \u201cThe biggest challenge that corporate executives face when they go into government is understanding the political environment. The more operational their organization is, the more the kinds of skills they have in the corporate world are applicable to government.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama hasn\u2019t always turned to the business world for top-level appointees, but he did tap former Microsoft executive Kurt DelBene to take over management of HealthCare.gov after another official known for his management background, Jeffrey Zients, left that post to head the National Economic Council. Former Obama Commerce Secretary John Bryson had been CEO of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison.\n\nRelated: VA Bill Means a New $50 Billion Entitlement\n\nThe list of those who moved from corner offices at Fortune 500 companies to the halls of power in D.C. was a long one in the administration of President George W. Bush. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, of course, had been CEO of Halliburton. Paul O\u2019Neill was the CEO of Pittsburgh-based industrial giant Alcoa and RAND Corporation chairman before becoming the Secretary of the Treasury during Bush\u2019s first term. O\u2019Neill was replaced by John Snow, the former CEO of CSX Corporation. Succeeding Snow was Hank Paulson, the former Goldman Sachs CEO.\n\nKelman explained that former business executives taking on a government role can struggle with a sudden loss of ability to make the organization operate just as they wish. \u201cIt\u2019s often said that the board of directors of a cabinet secretary is 535 people,\u201d Kelman said. \u201cThe members of Congress are a very large board of directors. And they are more hands-on than most boards of directors.\u201d\n\nWorking in McDonald\u2019s favor is that the VA is not typically the center of political controversy since there is general unity on both sides of the congressional divide about the desire to provide competent services to veterans.\n\nRelated: 7 of the Most Outrageous Abuses at VA Medical Centers\n\nKelman said he perceived corporate chieftains transitioning to government jobs to generally be people of integrity, and the problems they have encountered at times often stemmed from lack of political tact. It\u2019s clear, though, that anyone making the switch from retired CEO to Cabinet Secretary isn\u2019t doing it for the money.\n\n\u201cCompared to his salary at Procter & Gamble, (McDonald will be) practically working for free,\u201d Kelman said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With Monday\u2019s appointment of Bob McDonald to head the Department of Veterans Affairs, President Obama\u2019s is going against the grain of previous VA secretary appointments, which have largely been filled by retired military generals, medical professionals, and politicians \u2013 not retired corporate executives.", "title": "Former Procter & Gamble CEO Faces Career Challenge of a Lifetime at VA", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/01/Former-PG-CEO-Faces-Career-Challenge-Lifetime-VA", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07012014_Barack_Obama_Bob_Mcdonald.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/01/Former-PG-CEO-Faces-Career-Challenge-Lifetime-VA", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/07012014_Barack_Obama_Bob_Mcdonald.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "With Monday\u2019s appointment of Bob McDonald to head the Department of Veterans Affairs, President Obama\u2019s is going against the grain of previous VA secretary appointments, which have largely been filled by retired military generals, medical professionals, and politicians \u2013 not retired corporate executives.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0713\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s clear, though, that anyone making the switch from retired CEO to Cabinet Secretary isn\u2019t doing it for the money.\nRelated: McDonald\u2019s VA \u2018To-Do List\u2019 Includes 6 Urgent Fixes\u201cMr.\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest played up McDonald\u2019s management history when asked about the appointment during Monday\u2019s press briefing.\nFormer Obama Commerce Secretary John Bryson had been CEO of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison.\n\u201cThe biggest challenge that corporate executives face when they go into government is understanding the political environment."}
