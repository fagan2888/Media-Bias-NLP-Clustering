Emergency workers on Sunday located the body of a man who apparently died several months ago above the north shore of the Gross Reservoir, according to the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office.

Hikers stumbled on the body on Saturday, but due to the difficulty of reaching the rough area where it was found, rescue workers waited until daylight Sunday to locate and investigate the scene, a sheriff’s release said.

“The initial findings on scene indicate the death was not suspicious,” the release said.

The Boulder County Coroner’s Office will make an official identification.

Boulder Emergency Squad, Longmont Emergency Unit, Rocky Mountain Rescue, Boulder County Coroner’s Office and the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office were all involved in the recovery.
