The metric they use is called the \u201cefficiency gap,\u201d which determines the number of \u201cwasted\u201d votes in each district \u2014 votes the party that won the district didn\u2019t need to win it \u2014 and then translating those votes into seats for the minority party.\n\nThey write:\n\nThe efficiency gap has several properties that make it ideal for measuring the extent of gerrymandering. First, it directly captures the packing and cracking that are at the heart of every biased plan. Surplus votes for winning candidates are the definition of packing, and lost votes for defeated candidates the essence of cracking. All a gerrymander is, in fact, is a plan that results in one party wasting many more votes than its opponent. The efficiency gap tells us exactly how big the difference between the parties\u2019 wasted votes is.\n\nThe efficiency gap aims to distribute seats based on a \u201cpartisan symmetry\u201d model, which aims to give each party the number of seats that corresponds to the overall percentage votes they receive within the state. This model varies greatly from the current system, in which seats are distributed based on simple majorities within individual districts.\n\nBut should we abandon or override the district model in favor of essentially statewide elections, just because districts look ridiculous or are at the mercy of the state\u2019s majority party? Not necessarily: Districts can be a good thing. They can group people from similar demographic areas who may have similar interests and give them direct, individualized representation from a person within their community.

But even in the context of this reality, the extent to which race limits black mens\u2019 employment prospects is still shocking.\n\nA new report from the liberal nonprofit Young Invincibles lays out some stark contrasts: A black man with a bachelor\u2019s degree, for instance, has the same chances of finding a job as a white man who dropped out of college. The gap between the likelihood of a black man and a white man\u2019s having a job is widest for those with the least education, and only essentially closes with a professional degree:\n\nEducation is a powerful factor in shrinking job-attainment and wage disparities. But affirmative-action and tuition-subsidy policies that offer easier access to higher education can sometimes work against the people it\u2019s intended to benefit.\n\nConsider the case of highly selective universities who admit some students with lower standardized testing scores relative to the whole student body. These policies can have a negative effect on future achievement, because these students are academically unprepared to compete with their peers. This can later contribute to employment gaps by pushing minority students into less rigorous and potentially less professionally useful college majors. Policies that place students in environments where they are likely to succeed academically may be one way to better address this disparity.\n\nCalifornia might vote to give its health-insurance commissioner power to reject premium hikes. This is not the way to fix rate shock.\n\nIn November, California will vote on Proposition 45, a proposal that would give the state the power to veto premium changes by health-insurance company. Shockingly, Dave Jones, the insurance commissioner, supports the measure: \u201cThis is the missing piece of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout health insurance rate regulation, we will continue to see excessive rates.\u201d\n\nBut over 200 groups, including hospitals, small businesses, and labor unions oppose Proposition 45, noting that the measure would increase barriers to care by creating delays and raising costs.\n\nBut this approach to curbing costs has understandable popular appeal: Californians suffered huge premium increases when the ACA was implemented, and Consumer Watchdog released a report saying that 1 million Californian insurance policy holders paid $250 million dollars for unreasonable premium hikes in 2012.
