(April 2, 2014) -- Just hours after the troubled Maryland Health Connection website,\n\n\n\nVisitors to the state website, which was designed to help uninsured Marylanders obtain health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, used a feedback form to immediately complain that they were unable to create accounts to search for health plans. They angrily reported frozen web pages, broken links, poor site design and other complaints.\n\n\n\n\"This was suppose to start on 10/1/2013, its 10/1/2013 and nothing is working,\" wrote one user at 3:42 a.m. on Oct. 1.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's 9:00PM on December 4th and the create account is freezing up,\u201d another user wrote two months later. \u201cYou should save face and put up a \"Site Closed\" when it is not functioning ... allowing the image of it still working stay is only frustrating those of us trying to sign up and destroying any ounce of dignity you have left.

Martin O'Malley and racist comments about President Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nTaken in total, the comments offer an inside look at specific problems experienced by real users of a site that has been plagued by problems since launch.\n\n\n\nSeveral of the problems users expressed in the beginning, such as the inability to create an account or change their password, have been resolved since December. Still, the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange board voted April 1 to scrap the broken website and rebuild it with technology from Connecticut\u2019s successful online insurance marketplace.\n\n\n\nIn February, state officials fired the lead information technology contractor, Noridian Healthcare Solutions, and replaced it with Optum/QSSI, a Columbia-based contractor. They had less than a month to fix issues with the site before the initial enrollment period ended March 31.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced March 9 that an inspector general would investigate how funds were spent to develop the Maryland Health Connection website and why problems occurred.\n\n\n\nTo help consumers navigate the website, the Maryland Health Connection tripled the number of call center workers in December. And on March 18, the MHBE board set up a new hotline to help Marylanders who had started applications but struggled to complete them before March 31.\n\n\n\nAttorney General Doug Gansler has criticized his rival for the governorship, Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown, for failing to resolve website glitches and boost enrollment numbers in his role as the co-chair of the state\u2019s Health Care Reform Coordinating Council.\n\n\n\nAfter the MHBE board voted to replace the troubled website, Brown and Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley released a joint statement, which recognized the shortcomings of the online marketplace but also asserted that the website will be ready for the next open enrollment period in November.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe hard work of getting so many Marylanders enrolled was made even tougher because Maryland\u2019s health exchange website did not meet expectations\u2014a source of great frustration, especially for those who were trying to obtain healthcare for the very first time,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOur Administration has not succeeded at every first try, but we have never given up.
