Those numbers were not broken down by enrollment in employer plans, Medicare or plans offered on the federal Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance marketplace.\n\n\u201cOur enrollment in the Exchange is meeting our expectations, and we will continue to offer a wide range of products and options to Ohioans, including both on and off the Exchange,\u201d Ashley said.\n\nCareSource, a downtown Dayton-based Medicaid managed care provider, is Ohio\u2019s second largest health insurer.
