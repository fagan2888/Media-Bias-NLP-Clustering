The Dom\u00adino\u2019s Pizza ex\u00adec\u00adut\u00adive and chair of the Amer\u00adic\u00adan Pizza Com\u00admunity\u2014D.C. has a trade group for everything\u2014has spent the past few years scrap\u00adping over Obama\u00adcare\u2019s man\u00addate for menu la\u00adbeling at fast-food chain res\u00adtaur\u00adants.\n\nYou might sus\u00adpect that\u2019s be\u00adcause Dom\u00adino\u2019s doesn\u2019t want its cus\u00adtom\u00aders to see how un\u00adhealthy the piz\u00adzas they\u2019re eat\u00ading are. She says you\u2019re wrong\u2014it\u2019s be\u00adcause nobody goes to the phys\u00adic\u00adal store to or\u00adder piz\u00adzas. So why make those busi\u00adnesses pay for something people won\u2019t see?\n\nThe pizza in\u00addustry lost the ini\u00adtial battle when the Food and Drug Ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion re\u00adleased fi\u00adnal reg\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtions based on the Af\u00adford\u00adable Care Act\u2019s menu-la\u00adbeling pro\u00advi\u00adsion at the end of last year. Pizza chains were re\u00adquired to post cal\u00ador\u00adie in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion on their in-store menu boards or face civil or crim\u00adin\u00adal pen\u00adal\u00adties. They, along with the rest of the fast-food sec\u00adtor, must com\u00adply by Dec. 1 of this year\u2014un\u00adless that dead\u00adline is delayed, as some be\u00adlieve it could be.\n\nThis is Big Pizza\u2019s beef: People or\u00adder pizza by phone or on\u00adline. (Liddle pressed this re\u00adport\u00ader on how he pro\u00adcures his pies. Usu\u00adally through a mo\u00adbile app, for the re\u00adcord.) The in\u00addustry es\u00adtim\u00adates that only 10 per\u00adcent\u2014and Liddle said it could be even as low as 2 per\u00adcent\u2014of their cus\u00adtom\u00aders are ac\u00adtu\u00adally go\u00ading to see the cal\u00ador\u00adie in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion that they put up in stores. Be\u00adcause of that, they didn\u2019t ini\u00adtially ex\u00adpect the FDA to man\u00addate cal\u00ador\u00adie counts on pizza places\u2019 phys\u00adic\u00adal menus. But that\u2019s what the fi\u00adnal reg\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtion re\u00adquires.\n\n\u201cVery few people walk in\u00adto a pizzer\u00adia, look up on a menu board and say, \u2018Hmm, what will I have?\u2019\u201d Liddle said in an in\u00adter\u00adview. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to not do la\u00adbeling. We do it already. We don\u2019t want to get out of it. We want to do it. We want to do it in a way that makes sense for our con\u00adsumers, that they can un\u00adder\u00adstand, and we want to do it in a way that won\u2019t bur\u00adden our small-busi\u00adness fran\u00adchisees.\u201d\n\nUn\u00adder the FDA rule, Liddle said, the small-busi\u00adness own\u00ader of a Dom\u00adino\u2019s fran\u00adchise is go\u00ading to have to spend a couple thou\u00adsand dol\u00adlars post\u00ading the in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion and it might not even help those se\u00adlect few cus\u00adtom\u00aders, any\u00adway. Dom\u00adino\u2019s has 34 mil\u00adlion dif\u00adfer\u00adent pizza com\u00adbin\u00ada\u00adtions; Liddle be\u00adlieves Pizza Hut has tens of mil\u00adlions more. The in\u00addustry there\u00adfore ar\u00adgues that nobody is go\u00ading to get any\u00adthing out of the huge cal\u00ador\u00adie ranges that its mem\u00adbers are go\u00ading to have to post on the menus at their stores to cov\u00ader all the pos\u00adsib\u00adil\u00adit\u00adies and com\u00adply with the rules.\n\nSo the Amer\u00adic\u00adan Pizza Com\u00admunity thinks it has a solu\u00adtion. It sup\u00adports a bill in\u00adtro\u00adduced last month by Rep. Cathy Mc\u00adMor\u00adris Rodgers, the No. 4 Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan in the House, and Demo\u00adcract\u00adic Rep. Lor\u00adetta Sanc\u00adhez that would re\u00advise the ACA\u2019s menu rules. Res\u00adtaur\u00adants where a ma\u00adjor\u00adity of or\u00adders are made off-premises (read: pizza places) could post their cal\u00ador\u00adie in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion on\u00adline to com\u00adply with the law. That way, the in\u00addustry ar\u00adgues, cus\u00adtom\u00aders could get the in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion where they\u2019re or\u00adder\u00ading. Dom\u00adino\u2019s put out a video last week of cus\u00adtom\u00aders com\u00adplain\u00ading about the reg\u00adu\u00adla\u00adtions to try to build some mo\u00admentum for the le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion.\n\nThe bill has 23 oth\u00ader co-spon\u00adsors, but no com\u00admit\u00adtee hear\u00ading has been sched\u00aduled yet, so its le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adive fu\u00adture is un\u00adcer\u00adtain. Mc\u00adMor\u00adris Rodgers and Sanc\u00adhez\u2019s of\u00adfices did not re\u00adspond to re\u00adquests for com\u00adment. Pizza typ\u00adic\u00adally isn\u2019t a ma\u00adjor play\u00ader on Cap\u00adit\u00adol Hill, but Liddle said they were plan\u00adning a fly-in of pizza ex\u00adec\u00adut\u00adives to break bread with law\u00admakers about the is\u00adsue.\n\nMenu la\u00adbeling is \u201cprob\u00adably our largest le\u00adgis\u00adlat\u00adive is\u00adsue,\u201d Liddle said. \u201cI think what we\u2019re ask\u00ading for is not really con\u00adtro\u00adver\u00adsial \u201c\u00a6 I be\u00adlieve we can get it done.\u201d\n\nThey are, however, go\u00ading to be bat\u00adtling what Liddle said she \u201clov\u00adingly call(s) the food po\u00adlice,\u201d the groups and in\u00addi\u00advidu\u00adals who strongly sup\u00adport Obama\u00adcare\u2019s menu rules.\n\nSara Bleich, an as\u00adso\u00adci\u00adate pro\u00adfess\u00ador at Johns Hop\u00adkins Uni\u00adversity who has done re\u00adsearch on menu la\u00adbeling, said that the FDA rules, which were broad\u00ader than many had an\u00adti\u00adcip\u00adated, had been \u201cex\u00adcit\u00ading from a pub\u00adlic health per\u00adspect\u00adive.\u201d They brought amuse\u00adment parks and pre\u00adpared food at gro\u00adcery stores un\u00adder their pur\u00adview, along with the pizza and bur\u00adger joints.\n\nFor now, the gen\u00ader\u00adal con\u00adsensus of the avail\u00adable stud\u00adies, con\u00adduc\u00adted in cit\u00adies such as New York and Seattle that had menu la\u00adbeling be\u00adfore Obama\u00adcare, is that the policy has lim\u00adited or no ef\u00adfect on in\u00addi\u00advidu\u00adal people\u2019s be\u00adha\u00advi\u00ador\u2014though there is some counterevid\u00adence. But their real im\u00adpact, ac\u00adcord\u00ading to Bleich\u2019s re\u00adsearch, seems to be that when res\u00adtaur\u00adants are forced to be trans\u00adpar\u00adent about their food, they start mak\u00ading it health\u00adi\u00ader. She has doc\u00adu\u00admented a 10 to 12 per\u00adcent de\u00adcline in cal\u00ador\u00adies at some es\u00adtab\u00adlish\u00adments since menu-la\u00adbeling took ef\u00adfect in U.S. cit\u00adies.\n\n\u201cThe reas\u00adon that is so im\u00adport\u00adant is that in\u00addi\u00advidu\u00adal be\u00adha\u00advi\u00ador is very res\u00adist\u00adant to change,\u201d Bleich said. But if res\u00adtaur\u00adants change in\u00adstead, \u201cthat is a huge win for pub\u00adlic health.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why the \u201cfood po\u00adlice\u201d would op\u00adpose the car\u00adve\u00adout that Big Pizza wants. For one, not all Amer\u00adic\u00adans have In\u00adter\u00adnet ac\u00adcess and some there\u00adfore wouldn\u2019t be\u00adne\u00adfit from the in\u00addustry\u2019s pro\u00adpos\u00adal. Second, and per\u00adhaps more im\u00adport\u00adant: If the re\u00adsearch holds, the new\u00adfound trans\u00adpar\u00adency will lead to health\u00adi\u00ader pizza re\u00adgard\u00adless of what cus\u00adtom\u00aders do. That is con\u00adsist\u00adent with what Obama\u00adcare was try\u00ading to ac\u00adcom\u00adplish.\n\n\u201cThe counter is ba\u00adsic\u00adally trans\u00adpar\u00adency. Con\u00adsumers should have uni\u00adform trans\u00adpar\u00adency,\u201d she said. \u201cPut\u00adting it on a menu board along\u00adside prices is el\u00adev\u00adat\u00ading in a way that the In\u00adter\u00adnet is not.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Journal", "description": "The industry is looking for a change to the FDA regulations mandated by the law.", "title": "Big Pizza Cooks Up Plan to Carve Up Obamacare\u2019s Menu-Labeling Rules", "url": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/26538/big-pizza-cooks-up-plan-carve-up-obamacares-menu-labeling-rules", "image": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2015/05/27/146648660.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "mxRH-jX1pR5MjoxIjXJOxnDElPR-loQvW49hc6LMh6w", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2015/05/27/146648660.jpg"}, "description": "The industry is looking for a change to the FDA regulations mandated by the law.", "site": "@nationaljournal", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Big Pizza Cooks Up Plan to Carve Up Obamacare\u2019s Menu-Labeling Rules"}, "description": "The industry is looking for a change to the FDA regulations mandated by the law.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe06bb\"", "article_summary": "The Dom\u00adino\u2019s Pizza ex\u00adec\u00adut\u00adive and chair of the Amer\u00adic\u00adan Pizza Com\u00admunity\u2014D.C.\nhas a trade group for everything\u2014has spent the past few years scrap\u00adping over Obama\u00adcare\u2019s man\u00addate for menu la\u00adbeling at fast-food chain res\u00adtaur\u00adants.\nPizza chains were re\u00adquired to post cal\u00ador\u00adie in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion on their in-store menu boards or face civil or crim\u00adin\u00adal pen\u00adal\u00adties.\nDom\u00adino\u2019s has 34 mil\u00adlion dif\u00adfer\u00adent pizza com\u00adbin\u00ada\u00adtions; Liddle be\u00adlieves Pizza Hut has tens of mil\u00adlions more.\nRes\u00adtaur\u00adants where a ma\u00adjor\u00adity of or\u00adders are made off-premises (read: pizza places) could post their cal\u00ador\u00adie in\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion on\u00adline to com\u00adply with the law."}
