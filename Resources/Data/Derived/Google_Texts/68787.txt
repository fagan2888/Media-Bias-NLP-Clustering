Spirit Lake, IA

A Lake Park, Iowa man has been arrested for his third DWI, among other charges, after leading law enforcement on a car chase early Saturday morning.

Arnolds Park Police attempted to pull over 26-year-old Troy Hunt around 1:45 a.m. Saturday for driving with no headlights. Hunt stopped at first, but then sped away, driving through yards and causing property damage.

Hunt then continued north on Highway 71 where spike strips were put out by law enforcement. With four flat tires, Hunt continued driving until he was finally stopped at the Walmart junction in Spirit Lake and arrested.

Hunt faces a myriad of charges along with his DWI, including eluding, no seatbelt, careless driving, failing to obey a stop sign, speeding, failing to comply with a police officer, and failing to yield upon entering a highway.
