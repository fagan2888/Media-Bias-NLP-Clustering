The rule, sometimes referred to as the conflicts of interest rule, mandates financial professionals who service individual retirement accounts, including IRAs and 401(k) plans, to serve the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the savers and disclose conflicts of interest.\n\nOn Thursday, the House passed H.J. Res. 88 along party lines with a vote of 234-183, with 16 lawmakers not voting.\n\nU.S. Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions, and who introduced the resolution April 19 in an effort to block the DOL\u2019s rule, said he was proud of his fellow lawmakers for moving the bill.\n\n\u201cSince the Department first proposed expanding the definition of fiduciary back in 2010, I have raised concerns about their approach,\u201d Roe said Thursday. \u201cWhile we can all agree that financial advisors should serve their clients\u2019 best interests, the Department has created an unnecessarily complicated rule that has almost as many pages as a dictionary.\u201d\n\nRoe said lawmakers tried their best to reason with the DOL through letters, hearings and meetings.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, reasoning with the Department has not worked, which is why I introduced this resolution to block this rule using Congressional Review Act,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis resolution will allow Americans to receive the kind of retirement advice they need, and I thank Rep. Wagner and Dr. Boustany for their support of this important effort.\u201d\n\nReps. Ann Wagner, R-Mo., and Charles Boustany, R-La., who serves as chairman of the Subcommittee on Tax Policy, are co-sponsors.\n\nThey contend, along with a majority of Senate Republicans, the DOL\u2019s rule restricts access to investment advice and will make it more difficult for low- and middle-income families to save for retirement.\n\nThey also argue the rule creates new obstacles for small business owners who want to offer employees options to save for retirement.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s economy, too many families are struggling to save for retirement. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial Americans have access to the retirement advice they need to make the best decisions for the future,\u201d Roe said previously. \u201cUnfortunately, the administration\u2019s misguided rule does just the opposite.\u201d\n\nIn a letter to members of Congress last week, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and other groups defending free markets and constitutional liberties urged lawmakers to back Roe\u2019s bill.\n\n\u201cUnder the fiduciary rule, the DOL claims authority never granted by Congress to greatly restrict investment choices for 401(k)s, individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and other saving vehicles,\u201d they wrote Thursday.\n\n\u201cIn the earlier, proposed regulation, referred to by many as \u2018Obamacare for your IRA,\u2019 the DOL did not even bother to hide its contempt for the intelligence of American savers. It said most Americans can\u2019t \u2018prudently manage retirement assets on their own.\u2019 Based on this paternalism, the administration now mandates that investment professionals -- even if they are serving self-directed investors -- must adhere to the government\u2019s one-size-fits-all definition of \u2018best interest\u2019 for the investment products they offer.\n\n\u201cThe final rule leaves no room for individual savers to decide what their own \u2018best interests\u2019 are.\u201d\n\nThe groups noted that center-left economists have concluded the rule would cause many Americans to lose their current brokers and could end up costing savers $80 billion over the next decade.\n\n\u201cWe believe the federal government should vigorously prosecute actual fraud by financial professionals, but otherwise leave savers free to seek guidance and make investment choices they deem in their own best interests, taking account of their own individual circumstances and preferences,\u201d they wrote.\n\nRoe\u2019s bill closely mirrors a resolution of disapproval introduced by Senate Republicans.\n\nOn April 18, Sens. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga.; Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn.; and Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., put forth their own resolution under the Congressional Review Act to stop the DOL from implementing the final rule.\n\nThey, too, argue it will have \u201cdevastating effects\u201d on retirement planning by families and small businesses.\n\n\u201cLike so many of this administration\u2019s decisions, their new fiduciary rule harms the very individuals it seeks to protect and prevents those hardworking Americans who are trying to plan for retirement from having the opportunity to access retirement advice,\u201d said Isakson, the lead sponsor.\n\nAlexander agreed, arguing that retirement planning will be available only to the rich under the rule because many financial advisors won\u2019t risk the new legal liability except for clients with big accounts.\n\n\u201cCongress needs to overturn this rule before it cripples low- and middle-income Tennesseans\u2019 access to affordable retirement advice -- and forces them to work longer and retire with less,\u201d he said.\n\nEnzi said he also is concerned the new rule will cut off access to advice.\n\n\u201cThis rule is a solution in search of a problem,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now a kid with a paper route, a family with some savings or a small business looking to help their employees can get retirement planning advice from an advisor without much hassle.\n\n\u201cWe already have financial literacy problems and this rule could stifle access to the good information already available, hurting the exact people that the rule is supposedly designed to serve.\u201d\n\nIf approved, a resolution of disapproval would allow Congress to stop the DOL from implementing the rule.\n\nThe final rule will begin to take effect in part by April 2017, with full implementation set for January 2018.\n\nA resolution of disapproval only needs a simple majority to pass and cannot be filibustered or amended, if acted upon during a 60-day window. It also must be signed by the president. Congress can overturn a veto with a two-thirds vote in both the Senate and the House.\n\nThe DOL\u2019s fiduciary rule has been years in the making and was the subject of a DOL press call in April. During the call, Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez called it a win for the middle class.\n\n\u201cAt its core, this rule ensures retirement savers get investment advice in their best interest,\u201d Perez said. \u201cIf that sounds like it is obviously the right thing to do, that\u2019s because it is.\u201d\n\nThe American Association for Justice, formerly the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, praised the rule in a statement by CEO Linda Lipsen.\n\n\u201cToo many working families have lost their hard-earned retirement savings after relying on a financial advisor who deliberately sold them poor investments more geared toward the advisor\u2019s bottom line than the investor\u2019s financial success,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Labor rightly moved to require that financial advisors give clients advice that is in their best interest, not anyone else\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe basic structure of the fiduciary rule is that financial advisors and institutions are not permitted to receive payments creating conflicts of interest with their retail retirement investors without meeting a prohibited transaction exemption.\n\nIn other words, without the exemption, firms cannot continue to set their own compensation structures.\n\nThis prohibited transaction exemption is referred to as the Best Interest Contract Exemption, or BICE. An advisor or firm who wishes to receive compensation that would otherwise be prohibited must meet the proposed BICE.\n\nAlso under the new rule, an investment contract cannot have a no-class action provision.\n\nFrom Legal Newsline: Reach Jessica Karmasek by email at jessica@legalnewsline.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The rule, sometimes referred to as the conflicts of interest rule, mandates financial professionals who service individual retirement accounts, including IRAs and 401(k) plans, to serve the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the savers and disclose conflicts of interest.", "author": "Jessica Karmasek", "og": {"url": "http://legalnewsline.com/stories/510722352-u-s-house-passes-resolution-to-block-dol-s-fiduciary-rule", "image": "https://jnswire.s3.amazonaws.com/jns-media/27/b1/191881/large_philroe.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The rule, sometimes referred to as the conflicts of interest rule, mandates financial professionals who service individual retirement accounts, including IRAs and 401(k) plans, to serve the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the savers and disclose conflicts of interest.", "title": "U.S. House passes resolution to block DOL\u2019s fiduciary rule"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://jnswire.s3.amazonaws.com/jns-media/27/b1/191881/large_philroe.jpg", "title": "U.S. House passes resolution to block DOL\u2019s fiduciary rule", "description": "The rule, sometimes referred to as the conflicts of interest rule, mandates financial professionals who service individual retirement accounts, including IRAs and 401(k) plans, to serve the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the savers and disclose conflicts of interest.", "card": "summary", "site": "@LegalNewsline"}, "articleid": 510722352, "article": {"published": "2016-05-02", "modified": "2016-05-02", "author": "http://legalnewsline.com/author/jessica-karmasek"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAt its core, this rule ensures retirement savers get investment advice in their best interest,\u201d Perez said.\nWASHINGTON (Legal Newsline) - Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution of disapproval blocking the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s controversial fiduciary rule.\nThis prohibited transaction exemption is referred to as the Best Interest Contract Exemption, or BICE.\n\u201cUnfortunately, reasoning with the Department has not worked, which is why I introduced this resolution to block this rule using Congressional Review Act,\u201d he said.\nThe DOL\u2019s fiduciary rule has been years in the making and was the subject of a DOL press call in April."}
