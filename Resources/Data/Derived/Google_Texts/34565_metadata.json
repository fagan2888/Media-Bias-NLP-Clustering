Ted Cruz of Texas gently differentiated himself from Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump on Thursday, saying that at some point voters will distinguish between \u201ccampaign conservatives\u201d and \u201ca consistent conservative.\u201d\n\nCandidates warn about future of first-in-nation primary Three Republican presidential candidates told Granite State voters on Thursday that 2016 could mark the last meaningful New Hampshire first-in-the-nation primary, and if it is, they said, it would be a tragedy for the entire nation. More\n\nBut Cruz said that while other Republican candidates \u201chave gone out of their way to smack him with a stick,\u201d he is pleased that Trump is running because Trump is bringing a lot of excitement to the race.\n\nAnd, he said, as voters tune in to debates primarily to watch Trump, they also hear Cruz\u2019s message, causing them, he said, to begin to unite behind his campaign.\n\n\u201cIf conservatives continue to unite behind our campaign, we are going to win the primary, and that\u2019s also how we win the general election,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said voters are looking for someone who has \u201cwalked the walk\u201d and not just \u201ctalked the talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the only candidate running who has been a consistent conservative,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been a fiscal conservative, a social conservative, a national security conservative, and we\u2019re seeing this in the debates. That\u2019s starting to flesh out.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn many ways this Republican primary has boiled down to one simple question: Who will stand up to Washington? And just about every candidate there is saying, \u2018I\u2019ll stand up to Washington,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nBut he said voters are now researching, \u201cWho actually has stood up to Washington? And in that regard, my record is markedly different from every other candidate on that stage. In terms of standing up not just to Democrats, but to leaders of our own party.\u201d\n\nHe said he has led the fight against the Affordable Care Act and funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nAnd in the Planned Parenthood fight, other Republican candidates \u201cwere nowhere to be found. It was like they were in witness protection.\u201d\n\nHe also said he was the only participant in the Tuesday night debate in Milwaukee who never supported amnesty for undocumented immigrants.\n\nCruz was joined by his wife, Heidi, at the New Hampshire State House as he signed the necessary document to make his primary candidacy official.\n\nAfterward, he joined several dozen supporters outside in the rain for a rally, where he was formally endorsed by members of the conservative 603 Alliance.\n\nThe group held an Iowa-style caucus in September. Cruz won the caucus and all members of the alliance agreed to support him for president.\n\nCruz energized the crowd by calling for a flat tax and by railing against \u201cthe Washington cartel\u201d -- politicians of both parties who, he said, act in concert to promote their own interests at the expense of average Americans.\n\nA flat tax, he said, would make the Internal Revenue Service unnecessary, and the agency could be abolished and said the \u201ccartel\u201d uses the IRS as an \u201cenforcer.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is where the cronyism is handed out,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s where the subsidies are given. It\u2019s where citizens are persecuted for exercising their constitutional rights.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Thu, 12 Nov 2015 20:41:51 EST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "John DiStaso", "og": {"site_name": "WMUR", "description": "U.S. Sen.
