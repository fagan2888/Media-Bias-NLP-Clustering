Lehman Brothers had gone under, and General Motors was on the verge of bankruptcy reorganization. The U.S. was in a deep recession, and stocks had plunged 57 percent from their high in October 2007.\n\nFast forward six years, and investors are enjoying one of the longest bull markets since the 1940s. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index has more than tripled since bottoming out at 676.53 on March 9, 2009.\n\nSo has this bull run its course? Most market strategists haven\u2019t seen the signs that typically accompany a market peak. Investors have yet to become rash or overconfident.\n\n\u201cBull markets end not because they grow old. They end because some excesses build,\u201d said Stephen Freedman, head of cross-asset strategy at UBS Wealth Management.\n\nHere are some questions and answers about the run-up in stocks.\n\nWhy do stocks keep rising?\n\nIt\u2019s a powerful combination of higher corporate profits and a growing economy.\n\nThe main driver is company earnings. Companies slashed costs in response to the recession that began in December 2007. That helped boost profit margins when demand began to recover. As a result, earnings per share have risen consistently since the end of the recession in 2009.\n\nHiring is picking up and costs are down. Most economists forecast growth of more than 3 percent this year.\n\nAs investors become more confident about growth, they\u2019re willing to pay more for stocks. The average price-to-earnings ratio for an S&P 500 company stands at 17.2. Six years ago, it was 11.\n\nWhat role has the Federal Reserve played?\n\nThe Federal Reserve has held its main lending rate close to zero since 2008. It has bought trillions of dollars in bonds to help hold down long-term interest rates. By cutting rates, policymakers have encouraged businesses and consumers to borrow and spend.\n\nThe historically low interest rates in the bond market have also made stocks look more attractive in comparison.\n\n\u201cEssentially, by investing in the S&P, you\u2019re getting the same yield as you would on a Treasury,\u201d said Marc Pinto, a portfolio manager at Janus. \u201cBut you have \u2026 the upside of stocks moving higher as companies grow their earnings.\u201d\n\nHow long can this bull market continue?\n\nAll bull markets must end. But few analysts are calling the end of this one just yet.\n\nThe U.S. economy is continuing to strengthen and inflation remains tame. And while the Fed has ended its bond-buying program, other global central banks, such as the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, are still providing stimulus to their economies.\n\nAlso, many of the excesses that accompany bull-market peaks haven\u2019t surfaced, says UBS Wealth Management\u2019s Freedman. Think of the housing boom that preceded the bust that began in 2007, or the dot-com mania of 1999 and early 2000.\n\nWhat kills bull markets?\n\nTypically, it\u2019s a recession. Four of the five bull markets since 1970 ended as investors got spooked by a recession, or the anticipation of one.\n\nBank of America analysts say that the most likely threat to the bull market would be rising inflation. That could cause a sell-off in bonds, sending shock waves throughout financial markets.\n\nAnother threat is a slump in earnings. That could happen if the surging dollar, already at a 12-year high against the euro, grows even stronger, making U.S. goods more expensive to customers overseas and translating into fewer dollars to corporate bottom lines.\n\nSteve Rothwell,\n\nThe Associated Press", "article_metadata": {"description": "Investors are enjoying one of the longest bull markets since the 1940s.
