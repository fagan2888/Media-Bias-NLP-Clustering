So once you\u2019ve got some grains of salt ready to toss into the mix, please indulge me for a moment as I make one of my own.\n\nHere it goes: Twenty years from now, assuming climate change has not yet ended the world as we know it, most American liberals won\u2019t think of this fall as the time when Republicans finally retook control of the U.S. Senate. And they won\u2019t think of it as the brief pause that separated the era of Barack Obama from that of Hillary Clinton. Instead, when the liberals of our near future look back on the current moment, they\u2019ll remember it as the hour when the Democratic Party began to move decisively to the left, thanks in no small part to the continued ascendance of Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nPessimist that I am, I\u2019ll readily grant that this is very optimistic. In fits and starts, the party\u2019s been moving leftward for a number of years now, and I\u2019ve little doubt that the midterm blowout will be cited by some as proof that Democrats must become even more centrist. Yet unlike the talk surrounding a historically ignored election, which will dissipate quickly (especially if I\u2019m right about the return of government-by-crisis), the opportunity raised by the Democratic Party\u2019s recent decision to make Warren part of its Senate leadership has the potential to be far more enduring. But only if liberal activists know what to do with it.\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s not entirely clear what the folks nominally in charge of this infamously disorganized party are trying to do by elevating Warren. Because the former Harvard Law professor has been prominent in liberal circles since the launch of her brainchild, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, it can be easy to forget that she\u2019s only been in Congress for a couple of years. And coming as it does after a truly disastrous midterm showing, this seeming vote of confidence from Democratic bigwigs has the risk of being a \u201cglass cliff\u201d situation. My former colleague Brian Beutler, for example, has guessed that Senate Dem leadership may have opted to bring Warren into the fold because they\u2019ll need a popular spokeswoman to deliver the next two years\u2019 worth of bad news to the \u201cprofessional left.\u201d\n\nStill, even if Warren\u2019s promotion isn\u2019t motivated entirely or primarily by idealism and generosity, it could nevertheless be a major turning point for activists looking to push the Democratic Party in a more left-wing direction. After many years of kvetching about their paltry influence \u2014 and following decade after decade of enviously watching the conservative movement refashion the GOP in its own image \u2014 lefty ideologues and organizers now have the chance to turn Warren into a kind of trojan horse for a resurgent politics of economic populism (or, as it used to be called, liberalism). And if they adapt and adhere to the script used many years ago by visionary right-wingers, who famously responded to an electoral drubbing in 1964 by staying the course and propelling a true believer to the White House less than 20 years later, it just might work.\n\nIt\u2019s not a perfect analogy, I admit. There are fundamental, irresolvable differences between liberals and conservatives, and they extend well beyond ideology and into the realms of psychology and sociology. (Liberals are less hierarchically minded, more demographically diverse.) Further, in spite of all the mythology about conservative movement turning the GOP into the \u201cparty of ideas,\u201d the fact is that the men (and women, but mostly men) who transformed the party of Lincoln into the chief vehicle of the Reagan Revolution spent much more time talking about and organizing around what they were against \u2014 taxes, the welfare state, the civil rights movement, feminism, LGBT equality, the separation of church and state, etc. \u2014 than what they were for. And while there are certainly some recent Supreme Court decisions they\u2019d like to see reversed, a politics centered around a return to the glorious past is, for liberals, not really an option.\n\nBut notwithstanding all of that, I still think the conservative example offers activist liberals unhappy with the Obama record \u2013which is most of them \u2014 some valuable lessons.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If they're smart, liberals could use Warren's new power to make the changes to the party that are so badly needed", "title": "It\u2019s Elizabeth Warren\u2019s party now!
