And since ESPN inked a $5.64 billion, 12-year deal to broadcast the new College Football Playoff, as its known, the network wants to make sure fans know its coming and how it works.\n\nSo naturally, they got Rudy.\n\nOr rather, they got Sean Astin, the actor who played Daniel Ruettiger, a walk-on football player at Notre Dame in the 1993 film \u201cRudy,\u201d which is beloved by many a weepy/sentimental male college football fan.\n\nIn a humorous clip on YouTube, Mr. Astin reprises his role, giving a \u201cinspiring\u201d locker room speech during which he explains the new playoff system, which will attempt to honor traditional college bowls but also satisfying fan wishes for a championship settled on the field rather than in polls\u2013an ongoing complaint about the sport.\n\nThe fact that ESPN is rolling out its promotional effort so early (the playoffs won\u2019t start until January) speaks to the stakes involved, and potential fan confusion (something Rudy pokes fun of in the clip).\n\nWhether the campaign succeeds won\u2019t be clear for a while. But one thing is for sure: Mr. Astin, now in his early 40s, still looks fairly youthful in the Notre Dame uniform.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "For the first time ever, college football, which typically ends its seasons with a series of traditional-yet-fractured bowl games,", "title": "ESPN Turns to Notre Dame Legend \u201cRudy\u201d to Explain College Football Playoff", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/07/14/espn-turns-to-notre-dame-legend-rudy-to-explain-college-football-playoff/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DR445_0714RU_G_20140714125047.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "ESPN Turns to Notre Dame Legend \u201cRudy\u201d to Explain College Football Playoff", "description": "For the first time ever, college football, which typically ends its seasons with a series of traditional-yet-fractured bowl games,", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Mike Shields", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "CMO Today Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "CMO Today", "article.summary": "For the first time ever, college football, which typically ends its seasons with a series of traditional-yet-fractured bowl games,", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-07-14T17:08:19-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/07/14/espn-turns-to-notre-dame-legend-rudy-to-explain-college-football-playoff/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-269B-1117", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "CSuite", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "For the first time ever, college football, which typically ends its seasons with a series of traditional-yet-fractured bowl games,", "title": "ESPN Turns to Notre Dame Legend \u201cRudy\u201d to Explain College Football Playoff", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/07/14/espn-turns-to-notre-dame-legend-rudy-to-explain-college-football-playoff/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DR445_0714RU_G_20140714125047.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "CMO Today", "article.id": "BL-269B-1117", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-14T17:08:34-04:00"}, "article_summary": "For the first time ever, college football, which typically ends its seasons with a series of traditional-yet-fractured bowl games, will have a playoff system.\nBut one thing is for sure: Mr. Astin, now in his early 40s, still looks fairly youthful in the Notre Dame uniform.\nAnd since ESPN inked a $5.64 billion, 12-year deal to broadcast the new College Football Playoff, as its known, the network wants to make sure fans know its coming and how it works.\nOr rather, they got Sean Astin, the actor who played Daniel Ruettiger, a walk-on football player at Notre Dame in the 1993 film \u201cRudy,\u201d which is beloved by many a weepy/sentimental male college football fan.\nSo naturally, they got Rudy."}
