Porcupine, SD

Work is underway to build a solar panel structure to create a sustainable community for people of the Pine Ridge Indian reservation.

Construction is taking place at the Thunder Valley Community Development Center near Porcupine by engineers of the South Dakota Air National Guard's 114th Fighter Wing, of Sioux Falls, and the Denmark Army as a part of the Golden Coyote training exercise.

"We average 10 to 12 people a day working on the project," Maj. Todd Mergen, engineer projects officer for the 114th CES, said. "We have some equipment operators doing site work, and our engineers are building a 1,760 square-foot, covered outdoor classroom and solar panel support structure."

The structure will be connected between two buildings. It will provide power and also serve as a canopy for an outdoor classroom.
