Both of the plans came with similar price tags, about $5.4 million in development costs. One of the plans, \u201cOption B,\u201d would include redevelopment of the entire existing building, to include space for municipal services, areas to be rented by other agencies, and apartment space. But even accounting for the sale of the current town hall building and the town\u2019s current town office expenses, Stevens said the option would still add about $247,000 to the town\u2019s annual budget. \u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental issue,\u201d Stevens said.Under the second plan, Option D, the old section of the building would be demolished, and the 1955 building would be redeveloped for town offices, public space, and a smaller amount of rental space for agencies. But Stevens said that option would cost even more than Option B, at about $292,000 per year. \u201cIt\u2019s because there isn\u2019t as much rental space,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish I could say I have a silver bullet here, but this is the information you wanted.\u201dStevens said the numbers weren\u2019t exact, but gave an idea of \u201corder of magnitude.\u201d But the bottom line, he said, is that \u201cif this were to happen, if the town were to take this over, we\u2019re looking at a quarter million for the town to carry the cost and debt.\u201dStevens\u2019 and Glassberg\u2019s presentation was met with silence from board members, which selectboard chair Tom Fitzgerald attributed to \u201csticker shock.\u201d Responding to a question from the public, Fitzgerald noted that a penny on the tax rate raises about $69,000 in Wilmington. \u201cSo this would add 3 to 4 cents,\u201d he said.Stevens told board members his firm was ready to work on more precise plans and costs, once the board chooses an option they want to pursue.In other matters, representatives from Deerfield Valley Rescue met with the board to discuss several issues ranging from funding to Act 250. Deerfield Valley Rescue administrator Heidi Taylor said the ambulance service is struggling with an increase in Medicaid patients. The problem, she said, is that Medicaid only pays 43% of the cost of a transport. The number of Medicaid patients in DVR\u2019s coverage area has doubled under the Medicaid expansion that was part of the Affordable Care Act, Taylor said. Although legislation has been proposed to increase the Medicaid reimbursement, Taylor said legislators have proposed a tax on rescue services. \u201cThe legislation would bring our reimbursement up to the 80% reimbursement physicians get, but they\u2019ve said \u2018If we do that, we\u2019re going to charge you a provider tax of 3.5% of everything you bring in.\u2019 That\u2019s going to cost us even more money, so we\u2019re trying to fight that.\u201dDeerfield Valley Rescue founding member Merrill Mundell asked board members to include the rescue service in Act 250 municipal impact discussions. \u201cWe feel we should be included in your discussions, and we should sign off on it. If you won\u2019t represent Deerfield Valley Rescue, we can get party status. But that shouldn\u2019t be necessary and we should be working together.\u201dBoard member John Gannon said the board was in the process of improving their Act 250 response to municipal impact questions, and asked if Deerfield Valley Rescue would like to be included in the same manner as the Wilmington fire and police departments. \u201cWe\u2019re planning to plagiarize from Dover\u2019s process,\u201d Gannon said. \u201cIf you\u2019re invited to that table for discussion, and we work with you to make sure your needs are met, would that make you comfortable?\u201dMundell and other rescue members appeared to agree that the plan would satisfy their concerns.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://dvalnews.com/images/article.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Community center could add quarter million to Wilmington\u2019s annual costs - WILMINGTON- The prospects of a town-owned community center at the former high school building appeared a bit more bleak after Wednesday evening\u2019s selectboard meeting.
