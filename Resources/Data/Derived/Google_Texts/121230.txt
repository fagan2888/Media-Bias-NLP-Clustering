Russert to join 'Meet the Press'

Luke Russert is officially joining NBC's "Meet the Press" as a regular contributor on Sundays and throughout the week online, the show's host Chuck Todd and Executive Producer John Reiss announced in a memo to staff on Friday.

"Luke has an impressive love for politics and has proven himself on the Capitol Hill beat. He’ll continue in his current role reporting for the network and MSNBC, but he’ll also branch out to take on new projects specifically for us," Todd and Reiss said. "He’ll be a valuable part of our mission to highlight what’s working outside Washington. He’s already moving forward on a series of digital reports profiling innovative leaders in public life, the private sector, philanthropy, and anywhere else around the country where folks are ignoring partisanship and tackling problems in interesting ways."

A report last week that Russert was being paid $500,000 for his new role was quickly swatted down by NBC spokespeople. Russert, son of the late "Meet the Press" host Tim Russert, joins MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, Washington Post's Nia-Malika Henderson and BuzzFeed's John Stanton as recently minted contributors to the Sunday show.
