Wild foxes in empty lots on Pascagoula Beach draw attention

Wild foxes are living on lots along the Pascagoula beach that became vacant after Hurricane Katrina.

The Sun Herald reports that at least two families of foxes about a half-mile apart are thriving with dens along the beachfront.

Neighbors who watch them believe the animals have an extensive underground home, with more than one exit, according to the newspaper.

The two families of wild foxes appear to be coexisting well with the adults killing squirrels and rats and bringing them home to a den of babies.

The foxes have become a popular attraction in the area, but people who live nearby don't want the animals to become tame and are asking people not to feed or interact with the foxes.
