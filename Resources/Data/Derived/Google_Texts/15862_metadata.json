Yet our Senate Majority Leader, who has reached millionaire status and is government employed (as in \u201celected\u201d) and hasn\u2019t produced any jobs on his own merits and not through political clout, but harasses two people who do actually produce many thousands of jobs that contribute to more thousand of jobs for our country.\n\nAlso according to Wikipedia, Koch owns many other varied industries as well as other ventures and investments. The firm employs 50,000 people in the United States and another 20,000 in 59 other countries.\n\nHowever, such was not the case and the U. S. Senator from Nevada, Harry Reid, was all alone in his condemnation of the Koch Brothers, the multi-billionaire duo who privately own Koch Industries, Inc., which, as Wikipedia states, is an American multinational corporation based in Wichita, Kansas, United States, with subsidiaries involved in manufacturing, trading and investments.\n\nWill wonders never cease? The biggest liar in America was strangely silent about the fact that his second-in-command of recently producing falsehoods actually one-upped him with the latest \u2018Big Whopper\u2019 not produced at the local Burger King factory. And you would have thought that when the subject was so relative to his personal name he would have at least announced his vocal approval.\n\nReid harasses the Koch Brothers simply because they \u201chave huge amounts of money,\u201d are contributors to the Republican Party who also recognize production and promotion in a political party that is positive for its citizens. Contrary to that scenario is multi-millionaire George Soros, who contributes \u201chuge amounts of money\u201d to the socialistic liberal politicians of the non-job producing Democrat Party as a downside.\n\nJust because the Koch Brothers appropriately run ads opposing ObamaCare, and it is their and everybody\u2019s right to point out the tragedies of that monstrosity of a law, Reid has no right to pillage the Koch\u2019s. He admits, \u201cI can\u2019t say that every one of the Koch brother\u2019s ads are a lie.\u201d but then does not elaborate and tell the country what the lies, that he tells us are lies, have in them to make them lies.\n\nIf the ads consist of real lies, why doesn\u2019t Reid just point them out to Americans and not just blast two good jobs producing citizens of America. I will admit the Liar Harry is probably exceptionally well qualified to recognize a lie due to his preference and frequent usage of prevarication, but IDENTIFY them, Harry, and get your feet out of the swamp.\n\nThe February 27, 2014 printed version owner of Liar Harry\u2019s Senate floor outburst against two very good and honorable Americans, is a news organ that should also recognize lies due to its praises in their masthead which reads, \u201cREAL LIBERAL POLITICS\u201d with questionable pride which authored the also questionable headline of the article about Reid slamming the Koch Brothers for lying about ObamaCare. One has to wonder how many lies that den of socialistic-communistic drivel produced in concocting its contents for Liar Harry\u2019s Senate speech.\n\nThe author of the printed online version, Justin Baragona, is also in character, praising Reid saying he, \u201cdid not pull any punches while on the floor.\u201d Though I can\u2019t figure that statement out when no where in Reid\u2019s speech did he throw any punches where he could repeat the lies Reid accuses the Koch Brothers of saying in the ads. If as Baragona states that \u2018Reid did not pull any punches\u2019 I wonder where they went.\n\nMaybe Reid and Baragona are planning another article next week or one day soon, headlining all of Reid\u2019s punches that they forgot to mention in the February 27, 2014 article. And incidentally, I also would like to see some explanation of all the calumny, as defined as \u201cA false statement maliciously made to injure another\u2019s reputation\u201d, which is contained in Reid\u2019s floor statement to wit:\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that every one of the Koch brother\u2019s ads are a lie..but a vast, vast majority of them are. What is going on with these two brothers who made billions of dollars last year in an attempt to buy our democracy is dishonest, deceptive, false and unfair. Just because you have huge amounts of money, you should not be able to run these false, misleading ads by the hundreds of millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nEven a United States Senator, and Majority Leader of the socialist liberal Democrat Party, should clarify a publicly printed charge of \u201can attempt to buy our democracy is dishonest, deceptive, false and unfair.\u201d And Reid says that the Koch Brothers lie! By comparison, he makes them look like angels.\n\nHarry Reid is quick to slam anyone who disagrees with any of his words or actions. I call him the Number 2 Liar behind the present and worst Liar possibly ever known to American politics, our current illegal president Barack Hussein Obama. Reid has been on the public dole and \u201csleaze\u201d list for most of his political life which has been over 50 years, and like Obama, he began his political career with very meager personal finances due to his schooling and never having been gainfully employed prior to his entry into politics.\n\nToday, as you read this some fifty-plus years later, earning nothing but government salaries or the more likely plums from investments born from ventures gained from political \u201cpay-offs\u201d \u201ctips\u201d and friendly advice, along with favored person investments and favorable legislations passed. In the military we called that kind of income \u201ckumsha\u201d. I don\u2019t know the derivatives of that word but the Merriam-Webster dictionary entry for cumshaw shows it to be, presents, gratuities; also: bribes, payoffs.\n\nOf course, our Harry was never in the military, though his age would have allowed Vietnam; but you can\u2019t make any \u201cbig\u201d money there. So it isn\u2019t expected that he would have culled his \u201cextra\u201d income from not overly large political salaries anything more than \u201cgood fortune from good friends.\u201d Believe me fellow loyal Americans, this man is a good example of why we NEED TERM LIMITS for government service. And those limits should be short enough not to be able to acquire or even get near the \u201cgravy train\u201d of government tax dollars. They\u2019re robbing us taxpayers blind. It MUST STOP!\n\nToo many politicians, notably Clinton and Obama have taken office without any substantial means only to become millionaires within a very few short years. Good people are waiting and willing to serve a short term for a reasonable, expenses-covered compensation. Get them while they\u2019re young and eager to serve their country. If our forces are reduced to pre-world war II, they won\u2019t have that avenue in which to serve.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "description": "The Second Biggest Liar in America Accuses Koch Brothers of Lying About ObamaCare, Harry Reid's assault on the Koch Brothers", "og": {"description": "The Second Biggest Liar in America Accuses Koch Brothers of Lying About ObamaCare, Harry Reid's assault on the Koch Brothers", "title": "The Second Biggest Liar in America Accuses Koch Brothers of Lying About ObamaCare"}, "robots": "index, follow", "revisit-after": "7 days", "keywords": "The Second Biggest Liar in America Accuses Koch Brothers of Lying About ObamaCare, Harry Reid's assault on the Koch Brothers", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Koch Brothers, to me, sound like very good neighbors and job producers, the types that are good for our country and not looking to get handouts and giveaways of taxpayers assets and tax dollars.\nJust because the Koch Brothers appropriately run ads opposing ObamaCare, and it is their and everybody\u2019s right to point out the tragedies of that monstrosity of a law, Reid has no right to pillage the Koch\u2019s.\nAlso according to Wikipedia, Koch owns many other varied industries as well as other ventures and investments.\nReid harasses the Koch Brothers simply because they \u201chave huge amounts of money,\u201d are contributors to the Republican Party who also recognize production and promotion in a political party that is positive for its citizens.\nI call him the Number 2 Liar behind the present and worst Liar possibly ever known to American politics, our current illegal president Barack Hussein Obama."}
