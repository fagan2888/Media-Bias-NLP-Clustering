The president and his Democratic allies in Congress are making a concerted election-year push to draw attention to women\u2019s wages. (Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nDemocrats, facing a tough midterm election with crucial races in red states, have been focused on highlighting issues like the gender pay gap and the minimum wage, framing the economy as yet another front in their \u201cwar on women\u201d strategy.\n\nWell, it seems to be paying off. At least for now.\n\nA new Washington Post-ABC News polls shows that women are increasingly engaged in the midterm elections, and energized by \u201cwomen\u2019s issues,\u201d although the economy, health care and how Washington works rank as the highest priorities.\n\nDemocrats have typically had an edge with women, and so far they have been able to maintain it, even as they have lost some ground.\n\nLet\u2019s start with President Obama.\n\nOverall, the poll shows that women have a more positive view of Obama than men--50 percent of women approve of the job that he is doing, while 42 percent of men approve. Since January, the president\u2019s approval rating among women has seen a slight uptick, while men\u2019s opinion of Obama has been on a slight decline.\n\nWomen also trust Obama more than they trust Republicans in Congress to deal with the country\u2019s challenges\u201345 percent pick Obama, with 36 percent choosing Republicans in Congress. For men, it\u2019s a tie, 40 percent to 40 percenct. Overall, though, Obama has lost ground among women, with Republicans gaining some ground. In December of 2012, women trusted Obama much more\u201357 percent picked him over Congress. The decline to 43 percent in December of 2013, came as the White House grappled with the disastrous health care Web site rollout.\n\nAnd, on the generic ballot, women give the edge to Democrats over Republicans, whereas men back Republicans, 49 to 40.\n\nThese numbers suggest that as a messenger, Obama is still a good one, although he lost some points around health care. None of this means that Democratic candidates will want Obama out on the stump with them, but Obama\u2019s strategy of highlighting women\u2019s issues from the White House, and on the road, does seem to continue to resonate with women voters, who backed him by double digits over Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nThe most interesting trend from this poll that backs this up is that over the last year, women have become much more likely to say they will vote.\n\nIn August of 2012, on the eve of a presidential election, 69 percent of women said that they were absolutely certain to vote. Now, that figure stands at 77 percent.\n\nSo what has energized women?\n\nThe issue that has so far shaped much of the debate on the ground has been the Affordable Care Act, although that strategy also seems to be shifting from an all-out assault on the law by GOP candidates, to something more nuanced.\n\nAnd where do women come down on health care? Before the numbers, some context.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats have both tried to frame the good and bad of health care around women. In anecdotes from the stump and in campaign commercials, women have been front and center, testifying as to how the ACA either helped them or hurt them.\n\nBut, according to our poll, neither side has gained the edge with women on Obamacare, although since March there has been a 5 point positive swing for the law among women.\n\nLike most midterms, November will be about getting out the base and our poll shows that the base sees \u201cissues that are especially important to women,\u201d as a midterm priority. Almost 70 percent of Democrats see these issues as important to their vote for candidates for Congress, with just 43 percent of Republicans saying the same thing. Overall, 53 percent of voters see this as important. Women voters, not surprisingly have some of the strongest views, and will have these issues in mind as they think about who to back for Congress.\n\nThis poll comes as a group of House Democratic women led by Rep. Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) wrap up a \u201cWhen Women Succeed, America Succeeds,\u201d bus tour that rolled through several states including New York, Illinois and Ohio and the White House preps for a June 23 working families summit at the White House.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Democrats have spent the last months framing the economy as a women's issue, highlighting the pay gap and minimum wage, an effort that seems to be working with women voters ahead of the midterms.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Democrats have spent the last months framing the economy as a women's issue, highlighting the pay gap and minimum wage, an effort that seems to be working with women voters ahead of the midterms.", "title": "Democrats\u2019 \u2018war on women\u2019 strategy still works.
