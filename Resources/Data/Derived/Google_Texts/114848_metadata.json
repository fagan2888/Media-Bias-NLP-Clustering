Diane Black is one of a handful of Republicans backed by an American Action Network campaign designed to bolster centrist members of the GOP majority. The center-right fights back American Action Network launches campaign backing House leaders against the right.\n\nThe center-right is putting more money into the game \u2014 and taking fresh aim at the conservatives bent on dragging the House to the right.\n\nThe deep-pocketed American Action Network, which has raised over $104 million since 2011, will put $1.8 million toward ads in 76 districts touting members who stood up to right-wing pressure and supported the House leadership on the budget and bipartisan Medicare legislation.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe digital and television ads follow the group\u2019s leap into last month\u2019s contentious Department of Homeland Security funding debate, in which it spent $400,000 against fellow Republicans who refused to fund the agency in protest of President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration actions. It followed with another $350,000 for TV ads in four districts to thank GOP lawmakers who backed the long-term funding deal in early March.\n\nAAN\u2019s latest blitz, coming in an otherwise fallow period with no candidates on the ballot, is potentially game-changing because so few resources are used to support the political center. For years, policy debates have been defined by the richest and loudest voices in the room: hard-liners who blast the \u201csquishy\u201d middle whenever lawmakers are teed up to take a controversial vote.\n\n\u201cWe believe in a center-right majority that is effective,\u201d said Mike Shields, president of AAN. \u201cWe\u2019ve elected a House and Senate, and we have an agenda in front of us in Congress \u2026 and our interest is to have that agenda be enacted and be effective.\u201d\n\nThe budget and Medicare-focused TV ads will support Tennessee Reps. Diane Black and Marsha Blackburn, Michigan Reps. Bill Huizenga and Fred Upton, Indiana Rep. Todd Young, Kentucky Rep. Brett Guthrie, and Washington Reps. Dan Newhouse and Cathy McMorris Rodgers.\n\n\u201cThey say it can\u2019t be done, that Washington is broken, and nobody is listening. They say we\u2019ll never balance America\u2019s budget, that we can\u2019t repeal Obamacare and nobody can reform Medicare to protect seniors and doctors or take on the big issues. But they aren\u2019t talking about Congresswoman Renee Ellmers,\u201d a narrator says in an ad set to run in Ellmers\u2019 North Carolina district.\n\nAAN has longstanding ties with Republican House leadership. It was co-founded in 2010 by former Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman and Rob Collins, a former chief of staff to then-House Minority Whip Eric Cantor. Shields, for his part, was the chief of staff at the Republican National Committee and a political director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. He also worked for Washington Rep. Dave Reichert \u2014 an ally of Speaker John Boehner \u2014 for four years.\n\nColeman said the group isn\u2019t following the playbook of Heritage Action or Club For Growth, with scorecards and threats of reprisals against Republicans who oppose their agendas. He said keeping DHS funded was a priority in line with core Republican principles, so the only debate was over tactics.\n\n\u201cIt was a good conservative vote,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all understood that Obama\u2019s executive order was way off base, but we\u2019ve had a history of government shutdowns that hurt [Republicans].\u201d\n\nBefore the group opted to run the DHS-focused ads against Reps. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.), Jim Bridenstine (R-Okla.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the group polled Republican primary voters and found overwhelming support to keep the agency funded. That poll found that 63 percent of respondents said they would prefer to fight Obama\u2019s immigration executive actions in the courts than by \u201ccutting off funding for the Department of Homeland Security.\u201d\n\nNow, Shields said, the ads in support of members who voted to fund DHS or for the House budget will help center-right lawmakers offset the inevitable backlash from conservatives.\n\nAAN spent close to $9 million during the 2014 midterm elections \u2014 mostly against Democrats, including Reps. Joe Garcia, Ron Barber and Pete Gallego, who all lost their seats last year. The Congressional Leadership fund \u2014 a super PAC closely related to AAN \u2014 spent another $9.76 million.\n\nAs a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, AAN does not need to disclose its donors, but OpenSecrets.org has reported, based on IRS documents, that past donors include the American Petroleum Institute, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the Republican Jewish Coalition.\n\nBrian Walsh, the group\u2019s past president, said the decision to target conservative Republicans at odds with GOP leaders represented an \u201cevolution\u201d of the group\u2019s desire to be the \u201creasonable voice\u201d in Republican policy debates. The DHS ads prompted surprise and anger from conservatives at being targeted by fellow GOP-ers.\n\nBoehner\u2019s office criticized the ads and denied any role with AAN.\n\nBut Walsh, now at RedPrint Strategies, said that despite the criticism, the effort was clearly effective in turning the conversation from ideology to tactics over how best to stop Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration.\n\nA Republican consultant said AAN could have done more to target conservative lawmakers but clearly wanted to keep focus on the DHS funding issue and not launch a negative ad war.\n\n\u201cThe network knows how to run a negative ad, and that was not a negative ad. It was more to send a message that these are the type of ads that are going to run if [members] continue\u201d to thwart party leaders, the consultant said. \u201cWhat I found fascinating about this entire endeavor is the realization that it changed the conversation.\u201d\n\nBut still, the ads won AAN no friends among conservatives. South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney \u2014 whom AAN targeted with digital ads \u2014 said they made it harder to work within the GOP caucus.\n\n\u201cIt does make you scratch your head when you go to a [Republican Conference] and there\u2019s a sheet of paper there about how we\u2019re all supposed to be team players,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cAnd while you\u2019re sitting there getting the message from your colleagues about being a team player, you get a text from your office saying the American Action Network \u2026 is running ads against you in the district.\u201d\n\nDan Holler, spokesperson for Heritage, said AAN is positioning itself as \u201ca big-business group, not a center-right group.\n\n\u201cWe work every day with folks all across the country to advance conservative policies in Congress. AAN throws around wads of cash to attack those trying to advance conservative policies,\u201d Holler said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "American Action Network launches campaign backing House leaders against the right.", "title": "The center-right fights back", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/american-action-network-congress-republicans-116668.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/04/05/150405_diane_black_ap_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Republicans,Renee Ellmers,American Action Network", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "American Action Network launches campaign backing House leaders against the right.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5478\"", "article_summary": "The center-right fights back American Action Network launches campaign backing House leaders against the right.\nTennessee Rep.
