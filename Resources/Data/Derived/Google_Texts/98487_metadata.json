Falling into a cadence he reserves for points about which he is especially passionate, Francis insisted that priests should embrace divorced couples, saying \u201c[they] are not excommunicated, and they absolutely must not be treated that way!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey always belong to the church,\u201d Francis said, reportedly sparking a round of applause. \u201cThe church is called to be always the open house of the Father. \u2026 No closed doors! No closed doors!\u201d\n\nVarious mainstream and Catholic publications were quick to cover the remark, wondering aloud what it could mean for the Church\u2019s longstanding debate over divorce. Granted, the pope didn\u2019t technically say anything contrary to existing Catholic teaching, which cites Christ\u2019s negative description of divorce in the Bible to prohibit granting communion to churchgoers who remarry. He noted that entering into this kind of union \u201ccontradicts the Christian sacrament,\u201d and admitted that there is \u201cno easy solution\u201d to the issue within the Church\u2019s current theological framework.\n\nThey always belong to the church.\n\nNevertheless, the pontiff\u2019s dogged belief that such couples remain active participants of the Church \u2014 that they not be kept \u201cat arm\u2019s length\u201d \u2014 appears to be part of a larger project of his papacy. It\u2019s certainly not the first time he has signaled a more open-minded approach to these kinds of couples: In June, Francis told a crowd in St. Peter\u2019s Square that there are times when it is \u201cmorally necessary\u201d for a married pair to separate when children are at risk. He made similar comments last December, lamenting that divorced Catholics are often \u201cexcommunicated de facto,\u201d urging the church to \u201copen the doors a little bit more,\u201d and asking \u201cWhy can\u2019t they be godparents?\u201d And when Pope Francis presided over the weddings of 20 couples at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica last September, the group included Catholics who had been married before (although their previous unions had presumably been annulled).\n\nSo why is Francis so eager to discuss this contentious issue, and why is he talking about it now? The answer seems to be a mixture of practicality, theology, and politics. Although instances of priests openly rejecting divorced couples because of their marital status are relatively rare, it does happen, and simply preaching the policy can lead to people feeling unwelcome in \u2014 and possibly even leaving \u2014 Catholic parishes. And as John L. Allen Jr. points out over at Crux, the number of people potentially impacted by the current divorce policy is vast: There are roughly 4.5 million divorced or remarried Catholics in the United States alone. Meanwhile, Pope Francis has been heralded for attempting to craft a more welcoming, less exclusionary Catholic Church, making his unease with this policy seem natural.\n\nThe timing of Francis\u2019 comments, however, is likely a preemptive move in preparation for the upcoming synod (gathering) of high-profile bishops in October, a followup meeting to the 2014 Extraordinary Synod on the Family. Last year\u2019s convening, which included heated discussions about divorced Catholics as well as other theological concerns such as same-sex marriage, was criticized for offering mixed messages on several issues \u2014 including divorced Catholics \u2014 by publishing confusing statements and pitting conservative and liberal wings of the church against one another.\n\nBut this year Catholic leaders are trying to preempt such controversies by meeting ahead of time. According to the National Catholic Reporter, factions who both favor and oppose opening up communion to divorced couples have begun organizing their supporters to deliver a coordinated message at the synod. This is particularly true of bishops from Germany, where most of the country\u2019s Catholic bishops reportedly support granting communion to divorced Catholics \u2014 in part to curb the growing number of parishioners defecting from the church in the region.\n\nTrue, the synods only serve as an advisory to Francis, and cannot in and of themselves change Catholic teaching. But the outcome of these debates could inspire Francis to take formal action on the issue of divorced Catholics. While he has yet to endorse a formal change in policy, the pontiff is clearly already making use of his pulpit to advocate for a more welcoming approach.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\u201cThe church is called to be always the open house of the Father. \u2026 No closed doors!
