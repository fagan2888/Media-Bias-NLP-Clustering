And the number of patients coming from West County is up by roughly one-third, she said. The numbers for Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Richmond were harder to come by. In a statement, Odette Bolano, senior vice president and area manager for Kaiser Richmond, said the emergency room is \u201cfrequently at or above capacity.\u201d\n\nAt a board meeting of the West Contra Costa Healthcare District, board chairman Eric Zell said Kaiser Richmond reported to the district that their average daily patients had increased from 110 patients to 208 since Doctors closed its doors, but representatives from Kaiser declined to verify those figures. An increase of 98 patients per day is roughly 18 percent higher than what was predicted by Contra Costa Emergency Medical Services, which published a report in June 2014 warning what would happen if Doctors stopped taking ambulance traffic. The authors of the report estimated that Kaiser Richmond would see an increase of 83 walk-in patients per day.\n\n\u201cWe do know we have an ongoing issue of too many walk-in patients using Kaiser\u2019s (emergency department),\u201d Contra Costa Health Services Director Dr. William Walker said at the July 29 WCCHD board meeting. \u201cWhen Kaiser Richmond\u2019s emergency department is full, we do attempt to move patients around and they have also been getting better at handling the load.\u201d\n\nThe county established an advice nurse line for residents who don\u2019t have insurance to call before walking into an emergency room, Walker said. It\u2019s one of the strategies the health services department hopes will help divert people away from using the emergency room, he said. The county also helped establish an urgent care clinic across the street from Doctors in San Pablo, run by LifeLong Medical Care.\n\nWhen patients come to the emergency room at Kaiser Richmond but don\u2019t need emergency care, Bolano said staff encourages those patients to visit either a primary care provider or an urgent care center, including LifeLong\u2019s clinic in San Pablo. The pressure on emergency departments means residents have to travel further to get care. According to statistics provided by Contra Costa Health Services, travel times for residents in West County have increased an average of 4 minutes since last year and an average of 5 minutes and 38 seconds since 2013. Residents in San Pablo have been hit the hardest.\n\nTransport times increased an average of 6 minutes and 26 seconds since last year and 9 minutes and 17 seconds since 2013, according to transport time data. The longer transport times is not only hard on patients, it\u2019s hard on the entire emergency medical system, American Medical Response spokesman Jason Sorrick said.\n\nThe number of patients being transported to a hospital outside of Contra Costa County has increased from 8 percent last year to between 28 percent and 31 percent today, according to data provided by Contra Costa Health Services.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a longer time that (patients) are suffering from whatever pain or illness they have,\u201d Sorrick said. \u201cYou\u2019re pulling ambulances out of the system and in order for us to maintain our response time, we have to accommodate for those losses in units.\u201d That means more ambulances on the street, which Sorrick said amounts to roughly 500 hours of additional staff time each week.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, if a hospital is impacted, if it physically doesn\u2019t have the capacity, that means you\u2019re waiting with your crew and some crews are waiting hours with a patient because the hospital doesn\u2019t have the ability to take those patients,\u201d he said.\n\nCompounding the problem is the same issue that forced the closure of Doctors in the first place: reductions in reimbursement rates for Medi-Cal and other patients since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, Kemp said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to note that all hospitals in the area are seeing an increase in emergency room visits and inpatient care -- Kaiser, John Muir, Eden, Delta -- with the exception of Highland in Oakland,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cWith more members of the community receiving care under the Affordable Care Act, the results are visible within the hospitals.\u201d\n\nSorrick echoed Kemp\u2019s concern.\n\n\u201cIt all boils down to lack of reimbursement, which really impacts the sustainability of the system,\u201d he said. \u201cThe county has done everything it can to address that situation, but the reality is they\u2019re not the ones who chose the levels of reimbursement for treating those patients.\u201d\n\nAlta Bates has partnered with the LifeLong urgent care clinic in San Pablo to take some of the burden off of its emergency room and Kemp said the hospital is also working with LifeLong to open an urgent care clinic in Berkeley, which is expected to happen in less than two months. Patricia Frost, director of emergency medical services for Contra Costa Health Services, said the department worked with surrounding counties for a year before Doctors stopped taking ambulance patients and those partnerships continue today.\n\n\u201cThis has been an example of a community coming together to deal with a crisis in access to care,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe all know that everything we\u2019re doing cannot replace a full-service hospital. We\u2019re trying to do the best we can with regard to access to urgent care and trying to use the (emergency medical services) system appropriately.\u201d\n\nBy Bay City News\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "El Cerrito, CA Patch", "description": "It has been three months since Doctors Medical Center closed.", "title": "Longer Ambulance Transport, ER Waiting Times After Doctors Medical Center Closure", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.patch.com/users/1372433/2015/08/T800x600/20150855c515302d7a2.png", "url": "http://patch.com/california/elcerrito/longer-ambulance-transport-er-waiting-times-after-doctors-medical-center-closure", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": 116541048368485, "section": "Health & Fitness", "published_time": "2015-08-07T16:30:10-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-07T16:30:10-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521361477908471}, "description": "El Cerrito, CA - It has been three months since Doctors Medical Center closed.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "The longer transport times is not only hard on patients, it\u2019s hard on the entire emergency medical system, American Medical Response spokesman Jason Sorrick said.\nThe county also helped establish an urgent care clinic across the street from Doctors in San Pablo, run by LifeLong Medical Care.\n\u201cWhen Doctors finally closed down, the patients we see in the ER actually doubled or tripled,\u201d she said.\nPatricia Frost, director of emergency medical services for Contra Costa Health Services, said the department worked with surrounding counties for a year before Doctors stopped taking ambulance patients and those partnerships continue today.\nIt\u2019s one of the strategies the health services department hopes will help divert people away from using the emergency room, he said."}
