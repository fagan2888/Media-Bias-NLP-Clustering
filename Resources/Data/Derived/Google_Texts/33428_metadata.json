Is this bill state encroachment on personal freedoms, or is this a matter of public safety?\n\nNurse practitioner Susan Brown prepares a flu vaccination for a customer.

(Photo: AP)\n\nForced vaccination is one of those hot button issues that often derails even the most polite of conversations, and can turn friends or even family into raging enemies.\n\nEven people who in many other cases believe in freedom of choice, when it comes to vaccination, some raise contentions, suggesting that refusing to vaccinate one\u2019s children infringes on the rights of those who might be infected by viruses that they might catch.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nAre they right? Or does everyone retain the right to determine what they put in their body, or what they do not put into their bodies, even if that might mean they are more susceptible to diseases?\n\nWhatever you believe the answer to that question is, California has made it clear what the State government believes. Legislation that would require vaccinations for nearly all California schoolchildren was revived Wednesday. In its second attempt, it was revived, passing a Senate committee that most thought would reject the measure.\n\nSenate Bill 277 passed the Senate Education Committee on a 7-2 vote and now heads to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nAs the bill currently stands, there are no exemptions for personal beliefs or religious requirements that would preclude some or all vaccinations. Such requirements are not limited to religions that oppose vaccination itself, but could restrict the use of vaccines grown on fetal or swine cultures. If people with such religious objections are forced or compelled to get vaccinations, is their free exercise of religion being infringed upon?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work we still have to do,\u201d Sen. Ben Allen, D-Santa Monica, commented, following the hearing.\n\nSen. Loni Hancock, a Berkeley Democrat whose district houses many non-vaccinating families, voted in favor of the bill, saying \u201cI supported SB 277 because I strongly believe in the validity and importance of vaccinations. My concern has always been to ensure that all children have access to educational opportunities. I believe that the current bill, as amended, does a good job of balancing the state\u2019s constitutional requirement to provide access to public education with the public health benefits of vaccinations.\u201d\n\nBut Sen. Connie Leyva, D-Chino, said that the bill could make it impossible for poorer families who opt out of vaccinations. \u201cI just still have a concern that this will not go far enough to help a two-income family who cannot home-school their child or a single working parent,\u201d she said.\n\nOpponents of SB 277, such as the California Coalition for Health Choice denounced the advancement of the bill as \u201coutright rigging the results of a vote.\u201d\n\nCritics like Joni Martin, who has vaccinated her two children, believes \u201cthis is a terrible bill. It\u2019s a ridiculous bill that needs to not pass. I\u2019m going to come any time I need to come to listen to what they say, and I\u2019m going to continue to work on getting the message out about all the reasons the bill is not justified.\u201d\n\nThis article was published by Counter Current News Copyright \u00a9 2015.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California Bill To Force Vaccination Of School Children Just Passed Senate Committee.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Jackson Marciana | Counter Current News", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "California Bill To Force Vaccination Of School Children Just Passed Senate Committee.", "title": "California Bill To Force Vaccination Of School Children Just Passed Senate Committee", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/california-bill-to-force-vaccination-of-school-children-just-passed-senate-committee/204848/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/flu-shot.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-24T16:46:39-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "California Bill To Force Vaccination Of School Children Just Passed Senate Committee.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/flu-shot.jpg", "title": "California Bill To Force Vaccination Of School Children Just Passed Senate Committee", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "viruses", "published_time": "2015-04-25T05:00:18-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-24T16:46:39-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd03\"", "article_summary": "Senate Bill 277 passed the Senate Education Committee on a 7-2 vote and now heads to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\nCalifornia Bill To Force Vaccination Of School Children Just Passed Senate CommitteeWhat do you think?\nIn its second attempt, it was revived, passing a Senate committee that most thought would reject the measure.\nWhatever you believe the answer to that question is, California has made it clear what the State government believes.\nIs this bill state encroachment on personal freedoms, or is this a matter of public safety?"}
