Howell Marketing Strategies LLC will close its Downtown office and rely on part-time contractors.

Howell Marketing principal Amy Howell released a statement late Wednesday disclosing the S. Main office site would be sold and noted she could “serve my clients from my car and my computer.”

Howell’s statement called the new approach a “remote work model” and described tough business conditions for traditional small firms.

“Obamacare, the taxes and overhead associated with small businesses makes it impossible for small businesses to be profitable,” the statement says.

Howell, who founded the business in her home in 1996, partnered two years later with Sandra McQuain and drew notable public relations accounts including the Memphis Grizzlies and the old Pinnacle Airlines.

In 2009, Howell moved the firm Downtown from East Memphis after the partnership dissolved. The firm most recently employed three to four workers.

Her statement Wednesday assailed a “political culture” that has heaped costs on small firms.

“Insurance premiums have gone up more than 40% and taxes are continuing to increase as well as workers comp, payroll and all of the taxes and fees associated with running a small business,” the statement says. “Last year the Federal government decided to audit our firm, finding no fault but costing Howell thousands in fees. It’s become obvious that the small business owner cannot thrive in this political culture and I have decided to sell my real estate, eliminate property taxes and go to a consulting model to eliminate payroll taxes and insurance.’’
