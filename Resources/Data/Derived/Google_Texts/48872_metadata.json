Despite having \u201cmountains of evidence\u201d and \u201cpeer-reviewed papers you could stack to the moon\u201d as stated on the blog of The Richard Dawkins Foundation, Bill Nye has no chance of coming out of the debate the winner. Ken Ham will, as the saying goes, take Bill Nye to church.\n\nThe debate has been met with some criticism. The Richard Dawkins Foundation, especially, believes that the event is pointless, and putting creationism on the same podium as evolution helps add credibility to its position. Nevertheless, the much talked about debate will go on.\n\nHeading into the event, both debaters made some good points of where they stand. On one corner is Ken Ham, the president of Answers in Genesis and the Creation Museum. The creationist mentioned that he is shocked whenever seeing youth leave church after being taught evolution.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill Nye \u201cthe Science Guy\u201d said in an interview with The Associated Press that Americans will not continue to innovate if students are raised to ignore all the knowledge about the universe and nature \u201cfor some ancient text.\u201d Unfortunately, Bill Nye has no chance to win the debate, primarily due to his background and the setting of the Feb. 4th event.\n\nThe debate will be held at the Creation Museum, which Ken Ham is president and CEO of. Thus, expect the audience to be in overwhelming favor of Ham, applauding loudly at every attempt of an argument he makes. Such as the case for many creationists, Ham will shout nonsense and ignore anything Bill Nye says and use complicated language to make him seem intelligent. Ken Ham will shove the bible down people\u2019s throats, take them to church, spread creationism, and give inspiring speeches to get them to rise on their feet. Considering this will be at Ham\u2019s home court, makes this point even more likely.\n\nBill Nye\u2019s background does not help with his chances. The \u201cScience Guy\u201d has only a bachelor\u2019s degree in engineering. Yes, he is smart, but as The Richard Dawkins Foundation points out, \u201che does not practice any forms of research science.\u201d RDF adds that all though Nye has contributed greatly to the field of education, he does not have the credentials to be the voice for evolution.\n\nThe big difference maker in the debate is how much Nye understands the other side of creationism, something that is as key in a debate as knowing one\u2019s own material. The home crowd will eat up Ken Ham\u2019s nonsense, and Bill Nye will have to be ready to come up with a counter argument that will appeal to the other side. Presenting facts point by point will not be enough.\n\nChances are, more evolution supporters will show up than expected at the debate on Ken Ham\u2019s home turf, considering that the number of Americans who support evolution almost doubles the percentage of creationists; 60 percent as opposed to 33 percent. However, the side that will be most open to both Ken Ham\u2019s and Bill Nye\u2019s arguments are those who believe in evolution, but yet, also believe that God played some kind of role in it, which makes up roughly a quarter of Americans.\n\nCurrently, things are looking bleak for Bill Nye, and it seems Ken Ham will take him to church with the home crowd behind him. Either way, the two personalities should be applauded for bringing creationism and evolution to the table in what will hopefully be an entertaining debate.\n\nEditorial By Kollin Lore\n\nSources\n\nRichard Dawkins Foundation\n\nPEW\n\nThe Christian Post\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "The February 4th debate between Ken Ham and Bill Nye, creationism vs. evolution, nears.
