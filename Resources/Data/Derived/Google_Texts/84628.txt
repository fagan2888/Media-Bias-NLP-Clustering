SEPTA's board of directors on Thursday approved the recently negotiated contract with 5,000 bus drivers, subway and trolley operators, cashiers, and mechanics.

The agreement with members of Transport Workers Union Local 234 avoided a possible transit strike.

The pact, ratified this month by TWU members, provides a 5 percent raise over the two-year term of the contract.

But it postpones difficult decisions on two major issues that will resurface soon: pensions and health-care contributions.

The TWU had argued that its members were getting shortchanged on their retirement benefits compared with SEPTA managers. That debate will continue.
