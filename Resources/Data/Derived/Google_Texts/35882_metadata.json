But the district\u2019s plan won\u2019t include information about the pipeline\u2019s cost or how the water district will repay Utah for the project.\n\nThe project, which is expected to begin construction in 2020, would allow Utah to grab more of a share of the Colorado River, which several states rely on for water.\n\nDistrict manager Ron Thompson said officials believe the pipeline will cost about a billion dollars and the water districts will have 50 years to repay the state.\n\nBut Thompson said it will be several years before details are finalized about where or how the pipeline will be built, so officials aren\u2019t yet trying to get a final cost estimate.\n\n\u201cUntil we know which options they\u2019re going to allow us to use, it\u2019s a little hard to put a price on this project,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added he\u2019s confident the district will be able to repay Utah by raising water rates and fees.\n\nZach Frankel, executive director of environmental group Utah Rivers Council, said he believes state water officials and the Washington County Conservancy District are purposely withholding details about the cost because the agencies know it won\u2019t be repaid with interest.\n\nFrankel told The Salt Lake Tribune (http://bit.ly/1Yv384c) that the repayment plan should be released now as part of public debate on the project.\n\n\u201cIt is time for them to put up or shut up,\u201d he said. \u201cShow us the debt payment schedule, or shelve the proposal to spend the taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d\n\nSome University of Utah economists say they believe the high cost of the project may lead the water district to hike water rates so high that residents eventually use less water and eliminate the need for the pipeline entirely.\n\nA university study on the project found that the water district would have to raise fees by at least 123 percent and water rates by 576 percent to pay for the pipeline.\n\nEconomics professor Gail Blattenberger, who is a former member of the Rivers Council, said it\u2019s possible that Washington County residents are using more water now because it is relatively cheap.\n\nThompson said the rate hikes estimated by the university economists were manipulated to follow their environmental agenda.\n\nHe said the water district he manages is working on a repayment plan but it\u2019s not finished or ready to be released.\n\nStory Continues \u2192", "article_metadata": {"description": "As officials in southern Utah prepare to release new details on plans to build a billion-dollar pipeline from Lake Powell to the growing city of St. George, environmentalists are raising questions about who will pay for the project and when.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/29/new-lake-powell-pipeline-report-wont-detail-repaym/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "As officials in southern Utah prepare to release new details on plans to build a billion-dollar pipeline from Lake Powell to the growing city of St. George, environmentalists are raising questions about who will pay for the project and when.", "title": "New Lake Powell pipeline report won\u2019t detail repayment plan"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "As officials in southern Utah prepare to release new details on plans to build a billion-dollar pipeline from Lake Powell to the growing city of St. George, environmentalists are raising questions abo", "card": "summary", "title": "New Lake Powell pipeline report won\u2019t detail repayment plan"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "He said the water district he manages is working on a repayment plan but it\u2019s not finished or ready to be released.\nBut the district\u2019s plan won\u2019t include information about the pipeline\u2019s cost or how the water district will repay Utah for the project.\nThe Washington County Water Conservancy District is releasing a report Tuesday listing about a dozen proposals for the 140-mile pipeline.\nFrankel told The Salt Lake Tribune (http://bit.ly/1Yv384c) that the repayment plan should be released now as part of public debate on the project.\nHe added he\u2019s confident the district will be able to repay Utah by raising water rates and fees."}
