The case involves the misappropriation of a $500,000 settlement and $25,000 advance from Nationwide. The money was intended for Callow\u2019s client, a car-accident victim who was left permanently disabled, unable to work and without a pension.\n\nPrior to being charged, Callow flew to Taiwan. SIU detectives worked with federal agencies to locate Callow in Taiwan; local law enforcement notified Callow that he had to leave the country. Callow returned to SeaTac International Airport the evening of March 4, where he was arrested and booked in King County Jail on a $500,000 bond.\n\n\u201cThis lawyer preyed on a vulnerable consumer who relied on an insurance settlement for medical treatments and to replace income,\u201d Kreidler said. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for Mr. Callow to face the criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nAccording to the charges, Nationwide in 2010 paid the victim a $25,000 advance and a $500,000 settlement; Callow\u2019s client received just $165,000 of that amount. Callow kept the $25,000 settlement and altered documents to show his client that Nationwide paid a $250,000 settlement, of which the client agreed to pay 33 percent in attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nRahrovi, a Nationwide employee, took $135,000 of the settlement for his role in the scam, according to court documents. Callow kept the remaining $200,000 through a series of transactions in various accounts and names, according to the charges. Callow has since been disbarred.\n\nCallow will be arraigned at a future date in King County Superior Court, at which time he will enter a plea.\n\nNationwide fired Rahrovi on Nov. 20, 2012. Rahrovi pled not guilty to the charges in January 2014 and is awaiting trial.\n\nCallow\u2019s client was unaware of the actual amount of the settlement until Kreidler\u2019s office informed the individual. Nationwide is working with the victim on paying the full settlement.\n\nIf you think you were a victim of Edward Joseph Callow, call the Commissioner\u2019s Special Investigations Unit at (360) 586-2570.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler\u2019s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) helped apprehend a Seattle attorney who fled the United States when he was charged in December 2013 with five felonies related to the theft of an insurance settlement.", "og": {"site_name": "Enumclaw Courier-Herald", "description": "Insurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler\u2019s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) helped apprehend a Seattle attorney who fled the United States when he was charged in December 2013 with five felonies related to the theft of an insurance settlement.", "title": "Lawyer who fled returns from Taiwan to face charges | Washington State Insurance Commissioner - Enumclaw Courier-Herald", "url": "http://www.courierherald.com/news/248665691.html", "image": "http://image.issuu.com/160524000436-31e10c45fb58432b9e47d4841bd5123c/jpg/page_1_thumb_large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"ipad": "Enumclaw Courier-Herald", "iphone": "Enumclaw Courier-Herald", "googleplay": "Enumclaw Courier-Herald"}, "id": {"ipad": 382819429, "iphone": 382819429, "googleplay": "com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_531db99cb00833bcd414459069dc7387"}}, "site": "@enumclaw_ch", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 213251298702198}, "msvalidate.01": "87E5B723352F7F19F9D4F82B38A4E2DB", "verify-v1": "xp46D8SohxCVm32IcD0J/9dlxOyum45B4gGBJuzIPBI=", "viewport": "width=1228"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9b99\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis lawyer preyed on a vulnerable consumer who relied on an insurance settlement for medical treatments and to replace income,\u201d Kreidler said.\nPrior to being charged, Callow flew to Taiwan.\nInsurance Commissioner Mike Kreidler\u2019s Special Investigations Unit (SIU) helped apprehend a Seattle attorney who fled the United States when he was charged in December 2013 with five felonies related to the theft of an insurance settlement.\nIf you think you were a victim of Edward Joseph Callow, call the Commissioner\u2019s Special Investigations Unit at (360) 586-2570.\nRahrovi, a Nationwide employee, took $135,000 of the settlement for his role in the scam, according to court documents."}
