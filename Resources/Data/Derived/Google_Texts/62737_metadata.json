Your husband\u2019s plan is clearly \u201caffordable\u201d because $130 a month works out to about 4 percent of your annual income. But adding you to the plan brings your total cost up to 12.5 percent of your income, which is ridiculous.\n\nBut since your plan is technically \u201caffordable\u201d (even though it\u2019s really not), you can\u2019t get a tax subsidy to drive down the cost of buying insurance on your state\u2019s Health Insurance Marketplace.\n\nThis makes no sense in the real world, and a lot of legal and policy experts believe that the IRS and Treasury didn\u2019t have to interpret the law this way. They could have gone with common sense and said that in a situation like yours, where adding a dependent to the employee plan drives the cost above that 9.5 percent threshold, you could turn it down and get a subsidy to buy your own coverage.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t, because federal policymakers decided that giving people like you a break would cost too much money and drive up the overall cost of the health law. \u201cIt is a huge coverage gap and the IRS interpretation of the law should be open to revisions,\u201d says DeAnn Friedholm, director of health reform for Consumers Union, our advocacy division.\n\nSen. Al Franken of Minnesota has introduced legislation that would fix the glitch, but given the partisan deadlock in Washington these days, it has basically no chance of being enacted.\n\nMeanwhile, back to you. Your choices are pretty grim, I\u2019m sorry to say. You shared your age and ZIP code with me so I was able to price out your options on your state\u2019s Health Insurance Marketplace. Sadly, the cheapest Bronze plan available without a subsidy is $299, which is even more than the $285 extra it would cost to sign up for your husband\u2019s workplace plan. By contrast, if you were able to claim a tax credit just for yourself, you\u2019d be able to get a much better Silver plan for just $131 a month.\n\nI have no idea where your husband works, but his employer would actually be doing you a favor by dropping coverage for spouses completely. That would mean you would not have an \u201coffer\u201d of employer coverage at all, and would then be able to buy that $131 Marketplace plan.\n\nYou don\u2019t have kids, but if you did, they would almost certainly be eligible for the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Children whose household income qualifies for CHIP can enroll regardless of whether a parent has access to \u201caffordable\u201d workplace coverage for them.\n\n-- Nancy Metcalf\n\n", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, ACA, family glitch, Internal Revenue Service, Treasury Department, Consumers Union, employer health plan, employer health insurance, affordable health insurance, CHIP, Al Franken, Health, Child & Teen, Ask Our Health Insurance Expert, Health Reform, Health Insurance, Ask Nancy", "Title": "When It's Too Expensive to Add Your Family to Your Health Plan - Consumer Reports", "og": {"url": "http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/12/when-it-s-too-expensive-to-add-your-family-to-your-health-plan/index.htm", "image": "http://www.consumerreports.org/content/dam/cro/news_articles/babies_kids/Mom_and_baby.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "When It's Too Expensive to Add Your Family to Your Health Plan - Consumer Reports"}, "robots": "INDEX,FOLLOW", "publishDate": "2014-12-03T22:30Z", "primarytag": "Health", "last-modified": "2014-12-03T22:51Z", "fb": {"app_id": 551478298314138}, "searchTitle": "Consumer Reports: When It's Too Expensive to Add Your Family to Your Health Plan - Consumer Reports", "keywords": "Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, ACA, family glitch, Internal Revenue Service, Treasury Department, Consumers Union, employer health plan, employer health insurance, affordable health insurance, CHIP, Al Franken, Health, Child & Teen, Ask Our Health Insurance Expert, Health Reform, Health Insurance, Ask Nancy", "contenttag": "Ask Our Health Insurance Expert", "description": "What happens when it's too expensive to add your family to your health plan?
