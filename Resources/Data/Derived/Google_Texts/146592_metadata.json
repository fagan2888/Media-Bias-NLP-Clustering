That includes 408,147 people in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe total, which was announced this week, is higher than the Obama administration's goal of 10 million for 2016. It will likely rise higher since enrollment at www.healthcare.gov continues until the end of January.\n\nThe federal government said that, of the people enrolled for 2016, about 26 percent are between the ages of 18 and 34. That's a closely watched number since younger, healthier people are needed to offset the costs of older, sicker customers.\n\nThe federal government said the 11.3 million total enrollment figure was comprised of about 3 million new customers with the rest being returning customers.\n\nThe government said that 83 percent of the people who enrolled qualified for federal help toward their monthly premiums, with the average subsidy amounting to $294 per month.\n\nThe final enrollment number reached at the end of January will likely dwindle. That's because people won't be considered officially enrolled unless they are paying their premiums.\n\nFor example, as of the end of last year's open enrollment, 11.7 million people had signed up. As of the end of last March, the figure had fallen to about 10.2 million, and had fallen to 9.9 million as of the end of June, according to CNBC. The Obama administration's goal for 2105 was 9.1 million \"effectuated\" enrollees -- people who enrolled and continued making monthly premiums.\n\nAs of last summer, about 516,000 Pennsylvania residents were enrolled in coverage purchased through the exchange.\n\nCorrection: This post was revised to include Pennsylvania enrollment. An earlier version said the figure wasn't available.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Federal government of the United States, Obama administration, Pennsylvania, health-care, pennsylvania, politics", "title": "Obamacare enrollment tops 2016 goal", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare enrollment tops 2016 goal\", \"link\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/01/pennsylvania_affordable_care_a.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/18311726-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"17764771\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-01-08T14:27:22Z\", \"author\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"tags\": [\"@topstories\",\"health-care\",\"pennsylvania\",\"politics\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/18311726-standard.jpg", "creator": "@DavidRWenner", "site": "@pennlive", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The number will likely rise since enrollment continues until Jan. 31."}, "article_date_updated": "Friday, January 08, 2016, 10:59 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.pennlive.com/midstate_impact/photo/obama-obamacare-affordable-care-act-d0d5828951408f0d.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"dwenner\", \"author_nickname\": \"David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com\", \"author_id\": \"569\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Real-Time News from PennLive\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.pennlive.com/news/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "PennLive.com", "description": "The number will likely rise since enrollment continues until Jan. 31.", "title": "Obamacare enrollment tops 2016 goal", "url": "http://www.pennlive.com/news/2016/01/pennsylvania_affordable_care_a.html", "image": "http://image.pennlive.com/home/penn-media/width620/img/midstate_impact/photo/18311726-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "PennLive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Friday, January 08, 2016,  9:27 AM", "article_author": "David Wenner | dwenner@pennlive.com", "Description": "The number will likely rise since enrollment continues until Jan. 31."}, "article_summary": "The federal government said the 11.3 million total enrollment figure was comprised of about 3 million new customers with the rest being returning customers.\nCorrection: This post was revised to include Pennsylvania enrollment.\nThe total, which was announced this week, is higher than the Obama administration's goal of 10 million for 2016.\nFor example, as of the end of last year's open enrollment, 11.7 million people had signed up.\nThe Obama administration's goal for 2105 was 9.1 million \"effectuated\" enrollees -- people who enrolled and continued making monthly premiums."}
