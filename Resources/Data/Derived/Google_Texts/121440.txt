TPG Capital believes there are many opportunities that can be grabbed with the nation's current health-care cost containment. This was according to a report published by The Wall Street Journal.

Jeff Rhodes, a principal at TPG, said: "If this is a baseball game, we are in the third innings of cost containment. We need to build the relevant tools and awareness of them, and drive these more disruptive models in the market place."

The Affordable Care Act was signed in 2010. The law aims to reduce costs and improve the quality of care. With the rising cost of in health care, private equity firms have been scrambling to acquire assets last year that can improve the system and reduce costs, the report explained.

In July, TPG announced its purchase of Ohio's benefit management firm Envision Pharmaceutical Holdings Inc. The deal was completed just this month. TPG had been looking for this kind of opportunity for years, the report said.

TPG plans to strengthen and expand Envision's operations, especially to corporate clients. According Rhodes, the megafirm hopes to double or triple Envision's USD3.5 billion annual revenue, The Wall Street Journal reported.
