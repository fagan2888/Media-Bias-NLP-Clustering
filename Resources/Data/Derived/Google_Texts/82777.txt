We have yet another study showing skyrocketing health insurance premiums due to Obamacare, this tiime courtesy of the site HealthPocket.com:

Without Subsidies Women & Men, Old & Young Average Higher Monthly Premiums with Obamacare …Average premium costs for 23-year-old women and men increased 44.9% and 78.2% respectively after the ACA’s implementation. For 63-year-olds the increase was 37.5% for women and only 22.7% for men. Young men had the highest premium increase (78.2%) among the groups examined while senior men had the smallest increase (22.7%)…

Nothing new, of course. But what I did find interesting was that older women have seen bigger premium hikes compared to older men. According to the study in 2013 women age 63 on average paid $539 per month for an individual policy, while men paid $603. In 2014, both paid an average of $741.

I wonder if all those politicians boasting that Obamacare ended the practice of insurance companies considering being a woman a “pre-existing condition” will remember to qualify their statement to explain that Obamacare only lowered premiums for younger women of childbearing age, while the law raised premiums for older women? Somehow I doubt it.
