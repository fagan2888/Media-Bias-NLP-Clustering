(Photo: Nathan Hunsinger, The Dallas Morning News/AP)\n\nAfter nearly 50 years living as a man, Leslie McMurray was reborn \u2014 but then lost nearly everything: her home, her marriage of 33 years and her job as a radio program director in Dallas.\n\nMcMurray also began her long and complicated battle with health insurance. She and many other transgender people face difficulties with health insurance providers who will not cover certain medical procedures or medications.\n\nAn estimated 700,000 transgender people live in the U.S. As public awareness of this population grows, spurred by such high-profile stories as that of Bruce Jenner\u2019s transition to Caitlyn, it\u2019s become clear that health insurance coverage for transgender-related procedures and wellness is a complicated maze of terminology and technicalities, experts say.\n\nSome insurance providers cover surgical procedures like gender reassignment surgery but do not cover procedures like feminization of the face for trans women (those who were born male but identify as female) or mastectomies for trans men (those born female who identify as male). Other providers do not cover surgeries related to gender reassignment but will cover certain hormonal treatments and mental health therapy.\n\n\u201cWhen health care really stresses biology, it leaves a large portion of us out,\u201d said Nell Gaither, president of the Trans Pride Initiative, a local advocacy group. \u201cOur lives depend on medical intervention. One way or another, we\u2019ll figure out how to get the treatment we need. (But) when insurance doesn\u2019t work, a lot of people turn to the Internet to get what they need, and that\u2019s extremely dangerous.\u201d\n\nHealth law helps\n\nInsurance company representatives say their plans abide by industry standards, including meeting Affordable Care Act regulations, which include a clause that insurance providers cannot discriminate on the basis of gender identity or stereotypes.\n\nAnd some insurance providers, including Aetna and Cigna, have broadened their policies to include more access for transgender-related coverage.\n\nBut many transgender patients who don\u2019t have an ACA plan say they have had components of their coverage denied or have been denied insurance altogether because the provider considers gender dysphoria a pre-existing condition, which they do not cover.\n\nJody Herman, scholar of public policy at the Williams Institute at UCLA, said insurance policies vary by state. For example, California law requires that insurers cover gender reassignment and hormone therapy, but Texas law doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u2018Life or death\u2019\n\nAfter McMurray lost a six-figure salary, her financial situation shifted dramatically, making it difficult for her to afford insurance. The complicated life she suddenly found herself living brought her to the brink of suicide.\n\nA 2014 study found that 46 percent of trans men and 42 percent of trans women attempt suicide in their lifetimes, according to the National Transgender Discrimination Survey, a report published by the Williams Institute and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was life or death,\u201d McMurray said. She couldn\u2019t go on living in a body she felt she didn\u2019t belong in, and she didn\u2019t see any other way out.\n\nACA plans include deductibles of up to thousands of dollars and high monthly payments \u2014 and gender reassignment surgery might not even be covered. So McMurray saw no sense in trying to get insurance.\n\nIn 2014, nearly 35 percent of transgender people living below the poverty level were uninsured, according to the Center for American Progress.\n\nGender-based illness\n\nOne day in January, Katie Sprinkle, a local attorney and a trans woman, got a call from one of her clients, a trans man.\n\nHe was legally recognized as male, which required a gender marker change, a legal process similar to having a name changed. He had recently undergone a procedure to remove his breasts, but now he was terrified because he had just been diagnosed with a form of breast cancer that only women can get.\n\nSprinkle considered going to a judge to reverse her client\u2019s gender marker back to female so that insurance would cover the cost of his treatment. In the end, her client chose not to.\n\nShe warns her clients who are trans men that if they develop any transition-related illnesses, they could have a problem with insurance companies. She tells them to talk to every woman in their family to find out what kind of diseases they might have inherited.\n\nA large percentage of transgender people report being mistreated by a medical care provider.\n\nThe National Transgender Discrimination Survey found that 60 percent of the transgender population who have attempted suicide have had a doctor or other provider refuse to treat them.\n\nCONFUSION AMONG DOCTORS\n\n\u2022Part of Leslie McMurray\u2019s mission is to educate those in the medical profession about transgender issues. So on a recent day, she took questions from a class of 30 to 40 medical students at UT Southwestern.\n\n\u2022The doctor moderating her visit to the classroom asked her to clarify the difference between gender dysphoria \u2014 identifying with a gender contrary to the one assigned at birth \u2014 and homosexuality.\n\n\u2022\u201cThe best way I can put it is gender identity is who I go to bed as,\u201d she said. \u201cSexuality is who I go to bed with.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dailyre.co/1M7JOTU", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "After nearly 50 years living as a man, Leslie McMurray was reborn \u2014 but then lost nearly everything: her home, her marriage of 33 years and her job as a radio program director in Dallas.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Record", "description": "After nearly 50 years living as a man, Leslie McMurray was reborn \u2014 but then lost nearly everything: her home, her marriage of 33 years and her job as a radio program director in Dallas.", "title": "Transgender health care a maze of difficulty", "url": "http://www.dailyrecord.com/story/life/2015/07/06/transgender-health-care-maze-difficulty/29769921/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/dailyrecord.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After nearly 50 years living as a man, Leslie McMurray was reborn \u2014 but then lost nearly everything: her home, her marriage of 33 years and her job as a radio program director in Dallas.", "title": "Transgender health care a maze of difficulty", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/93e54a58f38853c16d132211b8dc15b9a50999bd/c=718-0-4162-3444&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/06/Morristown/B9317982724Z.1_20150706115956_000_GL5B8GLR6.2-0.jpg", "creator": "@dailyrecord", "site": "@dailyrecord", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=860677320", "fb": {"app_id": 148966475155999}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "transgender health care, Bruce Jenner, Affordable Care Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc10a\"", "article_summary": "She and many other transgender people face difficulties with health insurance providers who will not cover certain medical procedures or medications.\nOther providers do not cover surgeries related to gender reassignment but will cover certain hormonal treatments and mental health therapy.\nFor example, California law requires that insurers cover gender reassignment and hormone therapy, but Texas law doesn\u2019t.\nMcMurray also began her long and complicated battle with health insurance.\nAnd some insurance providers, including Aetna and Cigna, have broadened their policies to include more access for transgender-related coverage."}
