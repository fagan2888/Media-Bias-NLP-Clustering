This year, Halloween falls in the middle of the week (next Thursday). So, many people are celebrating this weekend by attending costume parties or taking the kids Trick-or-Treating. The crew at The B.S. of A. anticipated this early need for Halloween humor.

Tonight’s all-new episode definitely has a Halloween theme to it. Here’s a sample platter of the comedy coming from Brian Sack and company, tonight at 10:30pm ET.

“The Halloween Funnies” – Beware, frightening punchlines and scary puns await you!

Never missing a chance to meld topical news stories with comedy, the B.S. of A. brings you an NSA / Halloween sketch called, “When A Stranger Calls, A Stranger Calls.”

Finally, no B.S. of A. episode would be complete without another well-deserved jab at the ongoing embarrassment of the Obamacare enrollment web site.

The B.S. of A. airs Saturday nights at 10:30pm ET, following The Wonderful World of Stu at 10pm ET.
