If the Supreme Court had just “one more liberal justice,” Sen. Ted Cruz says the second amendment could be no more.

According to the Des Moines Register, Cruz’s comments came during a campaign stop in Iowa on Friday. The Republican presidential candidate remarked:

“One more liberal justice and our right to keep and bear arms is taken away from us by an activist court.”

Cruz didn’t end his lambasting of the Court there. He continued, invoking veterans and the United Nations:

“One more liberal justice and they begin sandblasting and bulldozing veterans memorials throughout this country. One more liberal justice and we lose our sovereignty to the United Nations and the World Court.”

During his campaign for the 2016 Republican nomination, Cruz has been highly critical of the Supreme Court. After the controversial Court rulings last summer that ruled in favor of same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act, Cruz called for the Court’s justices to be subject to retention elections.

Retention elections, Cruz said, would add accountability to the Court, which has wide, sweeping power and limited constitutional checks.

Cruz positions himself to be a “firebrand conservative,” and it may be helping him in the polls. Following September’s Republican debate, Cruz has seen a surge in support.

A poll out Friday by the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg Politics placed Cruz in 3rd in Iowa among Republican-likely voters, behind first-place Ben Carson and second-place Donald Trump. That showing isn’t far off from his national average, according to RealClearPolitics, who places Cruz fourth.
