This doesn\u2019t come easily, because having lived abroad and seen some pretty nasty places in my time, I know there are a lot of great things about this country, and a lot of great people who live here, but lately, I\u2019ve reached the conclusion that the US is a sick and twisted country, in which the bad far outweighs the good.\n\nI can remember first feeling revolted about my country several times. The first was when I realized, at the tender age of 17, what an atrocity the US was committing against the people of Vietnam in my name \u2014 the rape and murderous destruction of peasant villages and the napalming of children in the South, and the carpet bombing of North Vietnam (including dikes, schools and hospitals). Later, I was shocked and revolted when I belatedly learned how my country had rounded up native born and naturalized Japanese-Americans and Japanese legal residents into concentration camps during WWII, and how the national government had been complicit in the taking of those vilely incarcerated people\u2019s farms, homes and businesses by conniving white fascists in California.\n\nBut those crimes, horrific as they were, pale in the face of what I see this country doing now.\n\nLet me count some of the ways that this country makes me sick:\n\n1. It\u2019s not just the latest release of a heavily redacted report on the Bush/Cheney administration\u2019s deliberate program of torture, launched in 2001 in the wake of 9-11, and carried on for years against not just alleged terrorists, but even against people known or suspected to be completely innocent of anything. It\u2019s that nothing has been done, or likely will be done, to punish those who authorized and advocated for these war crimes and crimes against humanity. And it\u2019s not just that, but that so many of my fellow Americans are okay with that. Even in the media, including on NPR, I hear reporters saying that one of the \u201cquestions\u201d about the government\u2019s torture program is whether it \u201cworked\u201d or not in obtaining information about acts of terrorism. Because it doesn\u2019t matter whether torture \u201cworked\u201d or not. The US and the rest of the nations of the world signed a treaty after World War II saying that torture is a criminal act (the penalty includes death under international law!). And so is covering up or failing to punish the crime of torture.\n\n2. The police in the United States have become so militarized in both a physical sense and in terms of their training and self-image, that they are now more of an army of occupation than \u201cpeace officers\u201d (there\u2019s an anachronistic term you don\u2019t even hear used anymore). Over and over we see police aggressively using force, including deadly force, in situations that call for calm and understanding. The most sickening thing to me, was watching a squad car in Cleveland race directly onto a park lawn right up to an enclosed gazebo where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was sitting, alone, playing with a toy gun. In less than two seconds, one of the cops exits the car and shoots the boy fatally in the stomach. There was absolutely no call for this execution. No one was around being threatened by the kid. The cops should have pulled up safely at a distance, assessed the situation, and then called on Rice to exit the gazebo and drop the gun, even if they feared it was real. Or they should have ordered him to stay put and drop the gun, and then, if he didn\u2019t comply, waited for back up, including a trained negotiator. Instead, they just raced in like it was a hostage rescue attempt, and blew a little kid away. Then they did nothing to help him after shooting him. Ugh! And yet, there is not a wave of universal outrage over this monstrous police murder.\n\nNor is there universal outrage at the cops involved in the execution slaying of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO or in the completely pointless choking death of Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York, both of whose uniformed killers were exonerated by grossly manipulated and misled grand juries. Instead, we hear whites interviewed on TV shows saying that the cops did the right thing.\n\n3. But that\u2019s just part of it. I\u2019m disgusted by having as our president a man who lacks the intestinal fortitude to call out these above crimes and to insist that he will prosecute those who ordered the military and the CIA to use torture on captives in the so-called War on Terror. President Obama should be demanding that his so-called Justice Department aggressively prosecute those cops who are killing unarmed civilians if local prosecutors won\u2019t do it, and he should be ordering the prosecution of everyone who ordered, authorized, enabled or covered up torture by US government agents. (No wonder President Obama has been diagnosed with acid reflux: at least the man\u2019s alimentary canal appears to have a conscience!)\n\n4. I\u2019m disgusted that according to the Prison Policy Initiative, the US has at any given moment some 2.4 million people locked up (only two-thirds of whom have even been convicted of a crime, with most of the rest awaiting trial because they can\u2019t post the excessive bail set by our corrupt court system). And no wonder: Just between the late \u201880s and 2008, the number of federal laws for which someone can end up being jailed has soared from 3000 to 4450, and it keeps rising as charlatans in Congress keep passing laws to create ever more \u201ccrimes\u201d to punish. And that doesn\u2019t count state and local governments, which explains why the US, with 5% of the world\u2019s population, accounts for 25% of the world\u2019s prison inmates. Myself, I was threatened with jail not long ago by a thug cop in a neighboring town for hitch-hiking \u2014 an activity that actually is legal in my state, and that, if done improperly, is at most a citation offense like a parking violation calling for a ticket, not an arrest. No matter \u2014 if I hadn\u2019t put down my thumb, this bully in a uniform with sidearm would have cuffed me, and trumped up something: resisting arrest, disturbing the peace or some such tripe. We live in a punishment-obsessed society, overseen by cops who seem to derive pleasure in lording it over the public.\n\n5. I\u2019m sickened to see community after community pass laws making it illegal to feed the homeless. This in a country where in the wake of the Great Recession, we still have a real unemployment and underemployment rate of between 18% and 20% depending on how you\u2019re counting.\n\n6. I\u2019m ashamed and angry that Wall Street is essentially one gigantic crime scene \u2014 the place where trillions of dollars of wealth over the last decade has been siphoned out of the pockets of ordinary Americans into the hands of the wealthiest 1% or 5%, making this now the most unequal society among the 34 developed nations of the world. Not one leading banker from the nation\u2019s top so-called too-big-to-fail banks has even been charged with a crime, much less convicted and jailed for the biggest swindle the world has ever seen. On those rare occasions when the Justice Department has gone after some of these bankster crimes, it has reached \u201csettlements\u201d in the form of meaningless fines, and hasn\u2019t even, as part of the deal, required any of these crooked executives to leave their lucrative positions of power, or even to admit wrongdoing. In fact, these crooks in pinstripes instead of jail stripes are regularly invited guests at the White House and Congress, called upon to give their \u201cwisdom\u201d on points of government policy, for which they then reward their hosts generously with perks and \u201ccampaign contributions\u201d that are little more than bribes.\n\n7. I\u2019m outraged and ashamed that my country spends well over $1 trillion a year on its military, and has military personnel based in over 800 locations around the globe. This at a time when 50 million Americans are reportedly \u201cfood insecure\u201d \u2014 another way of saying that 50 million people, many of them children, go hungry at some point in the year \u2014 and when support programs like Food Stamps and Unemployment Compensation are being cut to save money. Worse yet, there is no national scandal over this. In fact, many Americans, perhaps a majority, think that all that spending on the military is a good thing, because it supposedly \u201ckeeps us safe\u201d and maybe \u201ccreates jobs.\u201d The sad truth is that today, the US, my country, is the world\u2019s largest terrorist state \u2014 based objectively on its recent unrivaled history of illegally invading other lands, conducting drone killings across borders, kidnapping, torturing and disappearing people, and funding and assisting in the overthrow of foreign, often democratically elected, governments.\n\n8. I\u2019m sick at heart because half a century after the Freedom Riders and courageous local people won an end to Jim Crow laws in the South that had for generations kept black people from voting, at least half the country, and not just in the south but everywhere, are now trying to make it hard or impossible for blacks, hispanics and other people of color to vote. And our corrupted court system is backing them in many cases, right up to the US Supreme Court, which is now dominated by fascists, proto-fascists, and religio-fascists.\n\n9. I\u2019m embarrassed that my fellow Americans, by and large, care more about whether they can get the latest iPhone, or whether they have a god-given right to own an unlicensed automatic weapon, than about whether we still have a right to privacy, a right not to be spied on by the government, or whether corporations should be allowed, as now under Citizens United, to buy government officials directly, like sides of beef.\n\n10. I\u2019m disgusted that my countrymen and women no longer believe it is important for society to provide everyone with the basic services that allow all people a fair shot at climbing out of poverty. There is no longer a sense that everyone should be able to attend a decently funded public school, or have access to a tax-funded state college for free or for a small tuition \u2014 the kind that could be covered with a 10-hour work-study job. There is no longer any sense that all Americans should be entitled to quality health care. Even what support there is for the so-called Affordable Care Act, far from being about making quality care available for all, is mostly from individuals who selfishly want to be able to afford insurance for themselves. It\u2019s not about making it available to all. It\u2019s like, if the ACA enables you to afford insurance, you\u2019re for it, but it you have employer-provided insurance, you\u2019re against it. This is basically true in every area. Americans today have lost any communal sense of shared responsibility and shared struggle. People used to talk (incorrectly, I think) about the \u201860s generation being the \u201cme\u201d generation. Actually, it\u2019s pretty much the entire US that has become a \u201cme\u201d country.\n\n11. Finally, I can\u2019t forget the issue of climate change. The US has unquestionably been the primary contributor to climate change over the last century, as the most industrialized nation in the world. Even today, as it\u2019s carbon emissions are surpassed by China, the undeniable fact is that on a per capita basis, we Americans dump far more carbon into the atmosphere per person than anyone in China, by a factor of five or more. Yet our country has been a primary obstacle to any real efforts to slow or reverse climate change. The US, during this administration and the last, has actively subverted efforts to reach international agreements to limit greenhouse gases, even using the National Security Agency\u2019s spying abilities to monitor other countries\u2019 negotiation positons and to blackmail leaders. It is simply sickening too, how the selfishness of Americans even extends to caring not a whit about the horrors that will be faced by not just our grandchildren, but even our children (the World Bank, no environmental radical hotbed, warns that today\u2019s teens will face a world that is a staggering 6-8 degrees Fahrenheit hotter by the time they are 80!). This is selfishness \u2014 or \u2014 madness on a scale that is to me incomprehensible.\n\nI could go on, but I think eleven reasons to be ashamed of one\u2019s country ought to be more than enough.\n\nIt is for me.\n\nDave Lindorff is a founding member of ThisCantBeHappening!, an online newspaper collective, and is a contributor to Hopeless: Barack Obama and the Politics of Illusion (AK Press).", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "www.counterpunch.org", "description": "I\u2019ve Had It!", "title": "Eleven Reason\u2019s I\u2019m Ashamed to Be an American", "url": "http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/12/10/eleven-reasons-im-ashamed-to-be-an-american/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/dropzone/2015/06/OGFB4.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-10T12:25:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-12T05:33:39+00:00"}, "description": "I\u2019ve Had It!", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "robots": "noodp, noydir"}, "article_summary": "I could go on, but I think eleven reasons to be ashamed of one\u2019s country ought to be more than enough.\nI\u2019m outraged and ashamed that my country spends well over $1 trillion a year on its military, and has military personnel based in over 800 locations around the globe.\nIt\u2019s that nothing has been done, or likely will be done, to punish those who authorized and advocated for these war crimes and crimes against humanity.\nI\u2019m sickened to see community after community pass laws making it illegal to feed the homeless.\nBut those crimes, horrific as they were, pale in the face of what I see this country doing now."}
