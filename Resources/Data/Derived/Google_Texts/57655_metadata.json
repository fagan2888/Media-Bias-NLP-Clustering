For all the talk about Kelly\u2019s brilliance, he has yet to win a playoff game. He pushed his chips to the middle of the table with quarterback Sam Bradford. The grand experiment begins Monday night with Philadelphia an underdog at Atlanta.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: The Eagles create opinions. Columnists can\u2019t agree if they are the league\u2019s future or just an exciting toy soon to fall out of favor. Former players rip Kelly, including DeSean Jackson and LeSean McCoy, whose criticism features racial overtones. Kelly must win. Bradford holds the key. He ran a spread offense at Oklahoma. He went 10-for-10 with three touchdowns against the Packers in the preseason, turning attention to his QBR instead of his MRIs.\n\nBackground: Bradford hasn\u2019t played a full season since 2012. His knees require bubblewrap. If he runs much, he will spend most of his time sitting in the trainer\u2019s room.\n\nRenck\u2019s take: Bradford represents an upgrade over Nick Foles, who couldn\u2019t sustain his breakthrough performance. And he\u2019s better than many NFL quarterbacks. At least he thinks so. Bradford\u2019s return underscores two points: the Eagles, with DeMarco Murray and Bradford, boast offensive intrigue, and there are so few competent quarterbacks that Bradford is willing to pause contract talks and play out the season given the weak free agent market.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "NFL,Philadelphia Eagles,Sam Bradford,spotlight", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Philadelphia Eagles coach Chip Kelly pushed his chips to the middle of the table with quarterback Sam Bradford.", "title": "Sam Bradford: Spotlight on the Eagles quarterback", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/09/11/sam-bradford-spotlight-on-the-eagles-quarterback/35426/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/09/sam-bradford-495x362.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Philadelphia Eagles coach Chip Kelly pushed his chips to the middle of the table with quarterback Sam Bradford.", "title": "Sam Bradford: Spotlight on the Eagles quarterback", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2015/09/11/sam-bradford-spotlight-on-the-eagles-quarterback/35426/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2015/09/sam-bradford-495x362.jpg", "creator": "@troyrenck", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Philadelphia Eagles coach Chip Kelly pushed his chips to the middle of the table with quarterback Sam Bradford."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4e03\"", "article_summary": "Spotlight on \u2026 Sam Bradford, QB, Philadelphia EaglesWhen: Eagles coach Chip Kelly brings a mad scientist feel to a sport that begrudgingly evolves.\nHe pushed his chips to the middle of the table with quarterback Sam Bradford.\nWhat\u2019s up: The Eagles create opinions.\nKelly must win.\nColumnists can\u2019t agree if they are the league\u2019s future or just an exciting toy soon to fall out of favor."}
