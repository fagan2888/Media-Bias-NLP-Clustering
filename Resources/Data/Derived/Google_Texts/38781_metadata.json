Once drafted, the ordinance will return to the council for a public hearing and vote.\n\nUnder current Maine law, a person found guilty of selling tobacco products to anyone younger than 18 may be fined $50 to $1,500 plus court fees.

Those business owners have been skeptical of the city\u2019s plan, noting that an 18-year-old is old enough to sign up for the military, vote or buy a gun.\n\nCouncilors did not address that issue Monday, but three anti-tobacco advocates encouraged the council to raise the age. They said that people who start smoking in their teenage years have a harder time quitting later in life.\n\nAccording to the U.S. surgeon general, nearly 90 percent of adult smokers started before they turned 18.\n\n\u201cThe city of Portland leads when it comes to public health,\u201d said Richard Veilleux, program manager at MaineHealth and the incoming chairman of the American Heart Association of Maine\u2019s board of directors. \u201cWe do think this would make a big difference.\u201d\n\nDr. Chuck Radis, who is running for the Maine Senate as a Democrat, also supported the proposal. \u201cPersonally, I would support this at the state level,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder Maine law, a person found guilty of selling tobacco products to anyone younger than 18 may be fined $50 to $1,500 plus court fees. Anyone younger than 18 who possesses or uses tobacco may be fined $100 to $300 for the first offense and $200 to $500 for subsequent offenses.\n\nIn other business Monday, the council unanimously adopted a resolution directing the city manager not to spend city funds for nonessential employee travel to North Carolina, Mississippi and other states that have removed civil rights protections for lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people.\n\nMatt Moonen, executive director of EqualityMaine, the state\u2019s leading advocate for the LGBT community, said the resolution was important, not only because other states were adopting so-called religious liberty laws, allowing people to discriminate based on religious belief, but also because similar efforts are underway in Maine.\n\n\u2018The reality is Maine is not immune to this backlash,\u201d Moonen said.\n\nThe move is largely symbolic, since the city typically does not approve nonessential travel. However, councilors said it was important to weigh in on the issue, since Portland was the first community in Maine to adopt an anti-discrimination ordinance, back in 1992.\n\nCity Councilor Nicholas Mavodones said the city should also closely examine whether it should use city funds for essential travel to those states and encouraged citizens to do the same. \u201cI would encourage them not to spend dollars in states that discriminate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe council also postponed a vote on whether to spend $25,000 on a street lamp sculpture at Woodfords Corner until July 6. City Manager Jon Jennings said the extra time will allow staff to meet with neighborhood groups and get feedback.\n\nThe sculpture would be part of a larger, $2.6 million effort to improve the five-way intersection on Forest Avenue, which sees more than 22,000 vehicles a day. The project includes a public plaza in front of the Odd Fellows Hall, where an 80-foot clock tower presides over the intersection. Work is expected to begin in the spring of 2017, with construction lasting most of the year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A City Council subcommittee will work on an ordinance to increase the minimum age from 18 to 21.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "A City Council subcommittee will work on an ordinance to increase the minimum age from 18 to 21.", "title": "Portland advances plan to raise age for buying tobacco - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/467696_US-Tobacco-Companies-Talks..jpg", "height": 597}, "updated_time": "2016-04-26T10:29:15-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2016/04/25/portland-council-advances-plan-to-raise-age-for-buying-tobacco/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A City Council subcommittee will work on an ordinance to increase the minimum age from 18 to 21.", "title": "Portland advances plan to raise age for buying tobacco - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/467696_US-Tobacco-Companies-Talks..jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Local & State", "tag": "tobacco sales", "published_time": "2016-04-25T19:51:54-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T10:29:15-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192Portland would become the first community in Maine to raise the legal age for buying tobacco, and join 135 other communities nationwide.\nA proposal to increase the minimum age to buy tobacco products in Portland took a step forward Monday.\nIn 1998, Portland became the first Maine community to ban smoking in restaurants, and in 2013 it extended that ban to public parks.\nCouncilors did not address that issue Monday, but three anti-tobacco advocates encouraged the council to raise the age.\nThe City Council voted unanimously to direct its Health and Human Services Committee to work on an ordinance that would increase the minimum age from 18 to 21."}
