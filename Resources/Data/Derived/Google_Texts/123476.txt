This Wednesday, the Congressional Budget Office released its last Monthly Budget Review for fiscal year 2014. Its finding? The federal budget deficit continues to tumble, falling to $486 billion in fiscal 2014 after reaching a high of $1.4 trillion during the financial crisis in fiscal 2009.

So why weren’t Alan Simpson, Erskine Bowles, and Peter Peterson running victory laps down the National Mall? That’s essentially the question economist Paul Krugman sets out to answer in his New York Times column today.

Deficit scolds like Simpson are reluctantly admitting that the hysterical predictions of imminent economic crisis they made a few years ago haven’t come true, but the deficit-obsessed continue to insist that we’re headed for a reckoning sooner or later. As Krugman points out, however, the long-run fiscal picture is nowhere near as dire as the deficit scolds have long envisioned. Health care costs, long seized upon by deficit hawks, are coming under control, for instance — thanks in large part to the Affordable Care Act.

And yet, Krugman observes, “fiscal hysteria” persists. That’s because for deficit scolds, a declining deficit is bad for business. In order to push their ultimate agenda of fiscal austerity and social insurance cuts, he argues, deficit hawks need the specter of fiscal catastrophe looming over the nation. Given the ideological proclivities of the deficit alarmist industry’s leading backers, it’s hard not to find Krugman’s take on what really motivates their manufactured panic persuasive.
