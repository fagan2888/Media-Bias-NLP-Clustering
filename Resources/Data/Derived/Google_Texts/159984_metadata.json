It was intended to reduce \u201credundant, inconsistent, or overlapping\u201d regulations.\n\nThe order was hailed as \u201cunprecedented\u201d by the president and former Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) administrator Cass Sunstein. However, Sam Batkins, director of regulatory policy at American Action Forum, found that the action was hardly unique and has had the opposite effect of its intended purpose.\u201cHas Washington actually cut red tape? On net, final rules from Order 13563 have added more than $10.2 billion in costs, mostly from new regulations labeled as \u2018retrospective,\u2019\u201d Batkins said. \u201cFinal rules have cut 7.9 million hours of paperwork, but Dodd-Frank and the Affordable Care Act have easily outpaced those deregulatory gains.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cderegulatory measures\u201d resulting from the executive order actually add over $10 billion in costs to the economy. For example, a final rule imposing energy standards for transformers carries a $5.22 billion cost to comply and 58,320 hours of paperwork.\n\nTaken with the proposed regulations under the executive order, the total burden to the economy would reach $13.7 billion.\n\nPresident Obama promised that the order would reduce paperwork in a January 2011 Wall Street Journal editorial.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.created": "01-22-14", "dc.format": "text/html", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dcterms.modified": "01-22-14", "og": {"url": "http://nation.foxnews.com/2014/01/22/obama-executive-order-has-added-102-billion-costs-economy", "type": "article", "image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/jan22_WH.jpg", "site_name": "FoxNation.com", "title": "Obama Executive Order Has Added $10.2 Billion in Costs to Economy"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/jan22_WH.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:cGFnZTE=", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Obama Executive Order Has Added $10.2 Billion in Costs to Economy\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2014\\/01\\/22\\/obama-executive-order-has-added-102-billion-costs-economy\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/jan22_WH.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox News\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-22T11:29:33-05:00\",\"identifier\":\"60773\"}", "prism.section": "nation", "dc.date": "2016-05-25", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Obama Executive Order Has Added $10.2 Billion in Costs to Economy\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2014\\/01\\/22\\/obama-executive-order-has-added-102-billion-costs-economy\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/jan22_WH.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox Nation\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-22T11:29:33-05:00\",\"post_id\":\"60773\"}", "fb": {"admins": 100000924384522, "app_id": 155242997843474}, "dc.language": "en-US", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "dc.title": "Obama Executive Order Has Added $10.2 Billion in Costs to Economy"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe60fe\"", "article_summary": "Tuesday was the third anniversary of Executive Order 13563, prompting the American Action Forum to examine the effects of the order.\nBY: Elizabeth Harrington, Washington Free BeaconAn executive order issued by President Barack Obama that was designed to \u201ccut red tape\u201d has added $10.2 billion in regulatory costs to the economy, according to a new report.\nTaken with the proposed regulations under the executive order, the total burden to the economy would reach $13.7 billion.\nOn net, final rules from Order 13563 have added more than $10.2 billion in costs, mostly from new regulations labeled as \u2018retrospective,\u2019\u201d Batkins said.\n\u201cFinal rules have cut 7.9 million hours of paperwork, but Dodd-Frank and the Affordable Care Act have easily outpaced those deregulatory gains.\u201dThe \u201cderegulatory measures\u201d resulting from the executive order actually add over $10 billion in costs to the economy."}
