But there\u2019s good news. According to FanSided.com, Bradford was cleared by the team\u2019s medical staff to run on the treadmill on Wednesday, and ESPN reported that Les Snead, the Rams\u2019 general manager, remains committed to Bradford as the starting QB for the 2014 season.\n\nRELATED Rams QB Sam Bradford out for the Season, Team Needs Backup\n\nA loss that Cherokee Nation fans could not recover from so quickly was the passing of Bud Adams. Adams, a Cherokee descent, was the founder of the Houston Oilers and owner of the Tennessee Titans who died in his Houston home at age 90.\n\nOn a happier note, Kansas City Chiefs backup QB Tyler Bray, citizen of the Potawatomi Nation, threw his first touchdown pass in the NFL while helping the Chiefs beat Green Bay 30-8. Who cares if it was a preseason game?\n\nAnd speaking of Green Bay, don\u2019t forget about the Native (and non-Native) Packers fans who braved freezing temperatures to make sure that the Washington Redskins did not get a warm welcome to Lambeau Field during the Packers home opener in September. Members of Wisconsin\u2019s local chapter of Idle No More, various tribes, as well as local and national leaders led those demonstrations outside the stadium; perhaps achieving their own, personal dig at Dan Snyder\u2019s decision to \u201cNever -- put that in CAPS\u201d change the team\u2019s name.\n\nProtests against the nickname for the D.C. franchise started early and grew louder every week; many Natives protested at every away game for the \u2018Redskins.\u2019 This all became the fodder for a growing name-change debate; taking the Change the Mascot campaign from a grassroots organization to a national movement.\n\nBut, through the good and bad, the beginning and middle of the 2013 NFL season, the ending of the season was the most exciting and rewarding time for Indian Country.\n\nThe two most popular NFL franchises in Indian Country -- the Seattle Seahawks and the Denver Broncos--will battle in the 48th Super Bowl -- and Native fans are supporting them all the way.\n\n\u201cThe most Native support used to be for the Dallas Cowboys,\u201d said Ken Frost, Southern Ute, to ICTMN. \u201cBut it\u2019s no longer America\u2019s team.\u201d\n\nFrost said he\u2019s been a hardcore Denver Bronco fan since he was a child. He\u2019d holler and scream at the TV with his grandma. He said Natives in the West claim the Broncos because the team is in the \u201cheart of Indian country\u201d and close to several reservations.\n\nIt\u2019s probably not a shock to hear that Frost picks Denver to prevail in the Super Bowl. \u201cPeyton\u2019s going to pick apart the Seattle defense,\u201d he said over the phone. \u201cDenver\u2019s gonna win it. I think it\u2019s gonna be around 37-23.\u201d\n\nSeahawk fans disagree.\n\n\u201cAlaskans support the Seahawks as if they are our team,\u201d said Myrna Gardner, Tlingit Indian tribe, who flew into Seattle from Alaska to watch the NFC Championship game last week. \u201cMy love began when I was born. My whole family watched the Seahawks. I recall Steve Largent's poster on the walls in the hallway at my parent's house.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing at the game, experiencing the power of the '12th Man' was a Bucket-list event,\u201d said Gardner. \u201cRepresenting Heinyaa Kwaan, \u2018the water people from across the bay,\u2019 was an honor,\u201d she said.\n\nChuck James, Treasurer of Tulalip Tribes, has been a Seahawks season-ticket holder for more than 30 years. He and his wife, Illene, attended last Sunday\u2019s playoff game as well, and expect Seattle to take home the Lombardi trophy next week.\n\n\u201cThe Seahawks have always been a big part of our lives here on the reservation and they\u2019ve inspired our young people to want to compete and win,\u201d James told ICTMN.\n\nRELATED Excited for Super Bowl XLVIII! 10 Pics of Native Fans Rooting for Denver or Seattle\n\n\u201cIf you go to the Tulalip Tribes administration building before a game, you\u2019ll see the excitement, with everyone wearing Seahawks gear and showing pride. We even have tribal members who design Seahawks gear that is sold in our casino resort gift shop,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWin or lose, the Seahawks are our team and we\u2019ll be there to support them,\u201d James said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Super Bowl XLVIII Is all About Indian Country", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/27/indian-country-chooses-sides-super-bowl-xlviii-153272", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/manning_vs_sherman.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Indian Country Chooses Sides for Super Bowl XLVIII"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-01-27T08:30-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/01/27/indian-country-chooses-sides-super-bowl-xlviii-153272", "dc": {"title": "Indian Country Chooses Sides for Super Bowl XLVIII"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "Indian Country Chooses Sides for Super Bowl XLVIII"}, "article_summary": "The two most popular NFL franchises in Indian Country -- the Seattle Seahawks and the Denver Broncos--will battle in the 48th Super Bowl -- and Native fans are supporting them all the way.\nThe beginning, middle and end of the 2013 season had plenty of ups, downs and surprises for Native American NFL fans.\nBut, through the good and bad, the beginning and middle of the 2013 NFL season, the ending of the season was the most exciting and rewarding time for Indian Country.\nRELATED Rams QB Sam Bradford out for the Season, Team Needs BackupA loss that Cherokee Nation fans could not recover from so quickly was the passing of Bud Adams.\nHe said Natives in the West claim the Broncos because the team is in the \u201cheart of Indian country\u201d and close to several reservations."}
