Actor Stephen Collins, known for his fatherly role on the long-running TV show "7th Heaven" has reportedly admitted for the first time to sexually abusing three girls dating as far back as 40 years ago.

People magazine reported Wednesday that Collins, 67, in an essay to be published in an upcoming issue, acknowledges "inappropriate sexual contact" between 1973 and 1994 but said he has not "had an impulse to act out in any such way" since then.

Allegations of sexual abuse first surfaced months ago when TMZ released an audio recording of what appeared to be him admitting to the acts during a marriage therapy session in 2012.

Collins writes in the essay that the recording was made without his knowledge.

In addition to the People essay, Collins sits down with Katie Couric for an interview expected to air Friday night on ABC's 20/20.

Collins portrayed Rev. Eric Camden, a pastor and father to seven children, on "7th Heaven." The show ran from 1996 until 2007.
