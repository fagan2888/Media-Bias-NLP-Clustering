Conversation was promised. A deal was not.\n\nSitting a few rows behind Ware on that flight was Pro Bowl cornerback Aqib Talib, who had agreed to contract terms with the Broncos the night before. The two knew nothing of the other\u2019s plans before their fortuitous meeting 30,000 feet in the air. But it didn\u2019t take long for the dots to be connected.\n\n\u201cWhen I looked back there in that back seat and I see Talib, I\u2019m like, you know what? They\u2019re trying to get the job done,\u201d Ware said.\n\nFive weeks after the Broncos gave up 43 points in a lopsided Super Bowl loss to the Seahawks, Elway opened up the Broncos\u2019 checkbook for a defensive shopping overhaul. In the span of 48 hours, he doled out $110 million to sign Talib, Ware and safety T.J. Ward.\n\nThe moves spurred an identity shift in Denver. The record- setting offense was going to take a back seat to Elway\u2019s carefully crafted defense. The hope, Ware said, was to resemble the Orange Crush, but the plan called for a Vince Lombardi Trophy.\n\nWATCH: Super Bowl 50 pregame show: Broncos vs. Panthers\n\nNow, the Broncos are one win from their third NFL championship, in large part because of their No. 1-ranked defense.\n\n\u201cDefense wins championships,\u201d Ware said, repeating a mantra often heard before the big game.\n\nA victory in Super Bowl 50 against Carolina could do more than add a shiny trophy to the Broncos\u2019 collection, however. It could validate this defense\u2019s spot among the finest in NFL history.\n\n\u201cPlay with fanatical effort\u201d\n\nAll the expensive defensive additions two years ago did not lead to immediate postseason success. The Broncos bowed out meekly in a home loss to Indianapolis in the divisional round a year ago, and soon after the coaching staff was gone.\n\nElway then signed perhaps his most valuable offseason addition since Peyton Manning. Wade Phillips, a 68-year-old Plan B for a team that scoffs at such a thing, agreed to come on board when the Broncos failed to get their first choice, Vance Joseph.\n\nPhillips immediately went about implementing his 3-4 defense, exploiting the power and speed of his edge rushers, and encouraging his linemen to attack the passer.\n\nThe mission was, and remains, simple: \u201cTo play with a fanatical effort and relentless pursuit to the ball,\u201d as Denver all-pro outside linebacker Von Miller describes it.\n\nIn one season Phillips has made a defense that ranked third in yards allowed (305.2 per game), tied for 16th in scoring (22.1 points per game) and tied for ninth in sacks (41) into one that led the league in yards allowed (283.1), passing yards (199.6) and sacks (52), and ranked near the top in multiple other key statistical categories.\n\nPhillips took a group that lacked the tenacity and passion Elway demanded into one that sacked Vikings quarterback Teddy Bridgewater seven times, held reigning MVP Aaron Rodgers of Green Bay to only 50 net yards passing, sent Colts star Andrew Luck to a hospital with a lacerated kidney and beat Patriots star Tom Brady twice, hitting him 20 times during the AFC championship game.\n\nAnd he took a defense that many players said felt stifling with its assignments under coordinator Jack Del Rio into one that has left opponents confused and, at many times looking helpless.\n\n\u201cGood thing they\u2019re confused,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019m pretty confusing usually. We play a matchup zone and people think it\u2019s man-to-man. Then we play man-to-man and we play some basic zone. We say, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re playing this zone, but when a guy comes over there, you match with him. You pass it off, just like in basketball. When another guy comes there, you go there.\u2019 We play a lot of match zone, but people think we\u2019re playing man-to-man. Hopefully that confuses them. It probably confused you already.\u201d\n\nConfusion is part of the grand plan, one that extends to the front seven. Phillips, having spent three seasons as Buddy Ryan\u2019s defensive coordinator in Philadelphia (1986-88), has installed parts of Ryan\u2019s famed \u201c46\u201d defense that the 1985 Chicago Bears rode to a Super Bowl title.\n\n\u201cI was able to incorporate the things that I thought were really good into a 3-4 because it\u2019s a 4-3 defense, the Bear defense,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cWe still utilize a lot of that now. Buddy was a true genius as far as defensive football was concerned.\u201d\n\nThe 1985 Bears went 15-1 and allowed an average of 4.4 yards per play and 12.4 points per game in the regular season. But it was in the postseason, with an average 3.3 points allowed per game and a 46-10 victory over the Patriots in Super Bowl XX, that gained them the distinction as arguably the NFL\u2019s finest defense ever.\n\nDenver\u2019s regular-season, per-play statistics are on par with those teams widely considered among the best in the past 30 years, including the 2000 Ravens, 2002 Buccaneers, 2008 Steelers and 2013 Seahawks. Denver allowed 4.4 yards per play, a league low, and 18.5 points per game, the fourth-fewest in the NFL. And its 12-4 record mirrored those of the 2000 Ravens, \u201902 Bucs and \u201908 Steelers.\n\nBut while those teams were lauded for their regular-season work, they sealed their legacy with Super Bowl victories. The Orange Crush of 1977, the team whose play set the bar for Ware and the defense at the start of the season, led the Broncos to their first Super Bowl in franchise history. But they lost to the Cowboys and their \u201cDoomsday II\u201d defense 27-10.\n\nTables turned in two years\n\nTom Jackson, a former Orange Crush linebacker who played in two Super Bowls with the Broncos, came prepared, as he typically does.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got all these stats stuck in my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cThe top eight highest-scoring teams in the history of football didn\u2019t win the Super Bowl. And that\u2019s insane, and that\u2019s crazy when you think about that, because what that means is we are all caught up in the visual of watching what offenses do.\n\n\u201cWe love it. We love to see teams score. The rules have been tilted toward scoring, and yet, if you have a really, really outstanding defense, it will bode you well when you get to the ultimate games.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why, perhaps, only five defensive players have been named Super Bowl MVP in the past three decades. The Bears had one, defensive end Richard Dent. The 2000 Ravens had linebacker Ray Lewis. The 2002 Bucs had safety Dexter Jackson, and the 2013 Seahawks had linebacker Malcolm Smith.\n\nGoing back further, the 1977 Cowboys, who defeated the Orange Crush in Super Bowl XII, saw two defensive linemen honored: Harvey Martin and Randy White.\n\nJackson doesn\u2019t care for the Orange Crush comparison. He never has, but it\u2019s out of admiration of the current Broncos.\n\n\u201cI respect this group so much because it\u2019s harder,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt got harder when they changed the rules. It got harder as they adjusted the game so that it would be easier to score, easier to throw, easier to get open. It\u2019s harder to get guys down on the ground; you have to think about every hit that you make. It\u2019s way more difficult to play defense now than it was for us when we played. What they\u2019re accomplishing is very, very special.\u201d\n\nSpecial, possibly legendary, but also necessary \u2014 a reminder Elway received two years ago when the 2013 Broncos made it to the Super Bowl with a record-setting offense, but quickly was shown the door by the league\u2019s No. 1 defense.\n\nThe 2015 Broncos have made it to Super Bowl 50 with the No. 1 defense and soon will face the top-scoring offense.\n\nThe tables have been turned, as planned. But Elway\u2019s vision called for more.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we haven\u2019t gotten the recognition we deserve,\u201d Talib said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t won the (championship) yet. There have been a lot of good defenses that didn\u2019t win a \u2018ship that you just forget about. But like the ones \u2014 Legion of Boom, \u201985 Bears, the Steel Curtain, 2002 Bucs, the Ravens \u2014 the guys who win the championships, you remember them. We don\u2019t even expect the recognition until we win the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Defense wins championships and that bodes well for Broncos", "title": "Defense wins championships and that bodes well for Broncos", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/06/defense-wins-championships-and-that-bodes-well-for-broncos/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160205__20160207_CC1_-SB16_cover-SP00FBNBRONX-1870p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160205__20160207_CC1_-SB16_cover-SP00FBNBRONX-1870p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-06T23:20:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T06:19:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Super Bowl 2016"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s way more difficult to play defense now than it was for us when we played.\nWATCH: Super Bowl 50 pregame show: Broncos vs. PanthersNow, the Broncos are one win from their third NFL championship, in large part because of their No.\nA victory in Super Bowl 50 against Carolina could do more than add a shiny trophy to the Broncos\u2019 collection, however.\nBut while those teams were lauded for their regular-season work, they sealed their legacy with Super Bowl victories.\n\u201cDefense wins championships,\u201d Ware said, repeating a mantra often heard before the big game."}
