As a result, the law built in risk-mitigating programs for insurers that sell health plans in the Obamacare exchanges.\n\nHHS officials have said the programs encourage competition, but Obamacare opponents argue the programs amount to taxpayer-funded bailouts for insurers who participate in the exchanges.\n\nThe risk-management programs include:\n\nA temporary \u201creinsurance\u201d provision that subsidizes individual market plans with a greater share of higher-cost enrollees.\n\nA temporary \u201crisk corridor\u201d program that establishes a government-approved range for insurer losses and profits.\n\nA permanent \u201crisk adjustment\u201d program that transfers money among insurers to account for the possibility some carriers will insure a higher or lower share of sicker, costlier customers.\n\n\u201cThe risk corridors program interact with all programs [in Obamacare] and protect insurers as they transition to this new market,\u201d Dr. Mandy Cohen, an acting deputy and director at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, testified at the hearing that often veered into other Obamacare hang-ups.\n\nCohen said the risk corridors program would run as budget neutral, but Chandler said taxpayers could be on the hook for paying out billions of dollars to insurers. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely to be a break-even proposition,\u201d Chandler said.\n\nDemocratic committee members said the risk corridor programs aren\u2019t a new idea and were set up in a similar fashion for the Medicare Part D drug coverage that was signed by President George W. Bush. Cori Uccello, testifying for the American Academy of Actuaries, affirmed that Medicare Part D\u2019s risk corridors program were more generous than the ones in Obamacare.\n\nBut Edmund Haislmaier, a senior research fellow in health policy with The Heritage Foundation, said the differences in the two government health programs do not make the comparison applicable for the current debate.\n\n\u201cMedicare Part D was an entirely new product and entirely new market\u201d that offered stand-along drug coverage to seniors, Haislmaier said. Although Obamacare imposes new rules and restrictions, insurers were not asked to create a new market for health plans that have long existed, he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Cohen said proposed rates for the Obamacare exchanges in 2015 are expected to increase \u201cin the single digits.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think if you look at the rate increases before [Obamacare] and what they were historically, we\u2019re very glad,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama administration officials say Obamacare's risk management programs are revenue-neutral, but experts at a House hearing said they could cost billions.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Obama administration officials say Obamacare's risk management programs are revenue-neutral, but experts at a House hearing said they could cost billions.", "title": "Obamacare\u2019s Risk-Management Programs Could Cost Billions, Experts Tell House", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014_06_17_Obamacare_bailout_Bowling.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-06-19T12:12:16+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1vUZr9C"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Obama administration officials say Obamacare's risk management programs are revenue-neutral, but experts at a House hearing said they could cost billions.", "creator": "@margyusc", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2014_06_17_Obamacare_bailout_Bowling.jpg"}, "title": "Obamacare\u2019s Risk-Management Programs Could Cost Billions, Experts Tell House", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2014-06-18T20:27:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-19T12:12:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Obama, House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Congress, risk management, healthcare, health insurance"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc980a\"", "article_summary": "The risk-management programs include:A temporary \u201creinsurance\u201d provision that subsidizes individual market plans with a greater share of higher-cost enrollees.\nAs a result, the law built in risk-mitigating programs for insurers that sell health plans in the Obamacare exchanges.\n\u201cAll of you ought to be very concerned about the way the risk corridors program is being implemented\u201d said Seth Chandler, a law professor at the University of Houston, told lawmakers.\nCohen said the risk corridors program would run as budget neutral, but Chandler said taxpayers could be on the hook for paying out billions of dollars to insurers.\nA temporary \u201crisk corridor\u201d program that establishes a government-approved range for insurer losses and profits."}
