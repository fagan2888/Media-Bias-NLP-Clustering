He is also the author of Rational Conclusions, a highly researched book evidencing factual support for the Bible across a broad array of academic disciplines.\n\nMr. Agresti's writings have been cited by numerous major media outlets, academic institutions, think tanks and government entities, such as CBS, PBS, Fox News, Investor's Business Daily, Pepperdine University, Vanderbilt University, the University of Wisconsin Madison, Rush Limbaugh, National Review, the Huffington Post, Roll Call, the Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, the Heritage Foundation, Tea Party Patriots, PolitiFact, the Media Research Center, the Wisconsin Legislature, the Oklahoma Department of Labor, and the education ministry of Northern Ireland.\n\nJames D. Agresti is the president of Just Facts , a think tank dedicated to researching and publishing verifiable facts about the leading public policy issues of our time.\n\nNewly published data from the U.S. Treasury shows that the federal government has amassed $76.4 trillion in debts, liabilities, and unfunded Social Security and Medicare obligations.\n\nThis amounts to $614,000 for every household in the U.S., a burden that equals 90 percent of the nation\u2019s private wealth, including the combined value of every American\u2019s assets in real estate, corporate stocks, small businesses, bonds, savings accounts, cash, and personal goods like automobiles and furniture.\n\nFederal law requires the U.S. Treasury and White House to produce an annual report on the \u201coverall financial position\u201d of the federal government. The law also requires the Government Accountability Office to audit the data, which is then published in the Financial Report of the United States Government.\n\nUnlike the federal budget, which primarily uses \u201ccash accounting,\u201d this report uses \u201caccrual accounting.\u201d The Government Accountability Office explains that this accounting method \u201cis intended to provide a complete picture of the federal government\u2019s financial operations and financial position.\u201d\n\nCash accounting is the simple process of counting money as it flows in or out. In contrast, accrual accounting measures financial commitments when they are made. For example, as federal workers earn pension benefits, accrual accounting measures these obligations in the year that they are earned. Cash accounting does not measure such liabilities until they are paid, which may not be until years or decades later.\n\nThe federal government requires large corporations to use accrual accounting for their pension plans, because this is the \u201cmost relevant and reliable\u201d way to measure their financial health. The same applies to other retirement benefits like healthcare. The official statement of this rule explains that \u201ca failure to accrue\u201d implies \u201cthat no obligation exists prior to the payment of benefits.\u201d Since an obligation does exist, failing to account for it \u201cimpairs the usefulness and integrity\u201d of financial statements.\n\nNonetheless, the federal budget, which is the \u201cgovernment\u2019s primary financial planning and control tool,\u201d is not bound by the accounting rules that the government imposes on the private sector. In the words of the U.S. Treasury, the federal budget is prepared \u201cprimarily on a \u2018cash basis\u2019.\u201d\n\nThis has major implications for future taxpayers, partly because pension and other retirement benefits are a large part of compensation packages for federal employees. When these benefits are included, civilian, non-postal federal employees receive an average of 16 percent more in compensation than private-sector workers with comparable education and work experience. Postal workers receive an even greater premium.\n\nThe recently released Treasury report shows that the federal government currently owes $6.7 trillion in pensions and other benefits to federal employees and veterans. Paying the present value of these benefits would require an average of $54,000 from every household in the U.S. Yet these liabilities are not reflected in the current federal budget or publicly held national debt.\n\nA similar situation exists with Social Security and Medicare, because the government primarily funds the current expenses of these programs with taxes from workers who don\u2019t receive benefits until they become senior citizens. Hence, Social Security and Medicare are sometimes called \u201cpay-as-you-go\u201d programs.\n\nOnce again, this is different from the private sector, where \u201cfederal law requires that private pension plans operate as funded plans, not as pay-as-you-go plans.\u201d As explained by the American Academy of Actuaries, the law requires private pension plans to pay for \u201cbenefits as they are earned\u201d to ensure \u201cintergenerational equity.\u201d In other words, the law prevents older workers from placing the costs of their retirements on younger workers, at least in the private sector.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare differ from pensions, because taxpayers don\u2019t have a contractual right to receive these benefits. In the original Social Security Act of 1935, Congress \u201creserved\u201d the \u201cright to alter, amend, or repeal any provision of this Act.\u201d Consequently, the Supreme Court ruled in 1960 that Congress can change Social Security benefits at will. Nevertheless, paying these benefits is an implied commitment of the federal government, and the law requires that these programs be included in the Financial Report of the U.S. Government.\n\nFederal actuaries measure the obligations of Social Security and Medicare in several different ways, but only one of them approximates the concept of accrual accounting. This is called the \u201cclosed-group\u201d obligation, which is the money needed to cover the shortfalls for all current taxpayers and beneficiaries in these programs. In the words of Harvard Law School professor and federal budget specialist Howell E. Jackson, the closed-group measure \u201creflects the financial burden or liability being passed on to future generations.\u201d These burdens amount to $26.7 trillion for Social Security and $28.5 trillion for Medicare.\n\nThe Treasury report includes other obligations of the federal government, like environmental liabilities and accounts payable. The report also accounts for federal assets, such as cash, real estate, and corporate stocks. This excludes federal stewardship land and heritage assets, such as national parks and the original copy of the Declaration of Independence. While these items have tangible value, the report explains that the government \u201cdoes not expect to use these assets to meet its obligations.\u201d\n\nTallying the Treasury\u2019s data on assets and subtracting its obligations shows that the federal government has a fiscal shortfall of $76.4 trillion in debts, liabilities, and unfunded Social Security/Medicare obligations. Divided evenly across all U.S. households, this amounts to an average of $614,000 per household.\n\nThe actual shortfall may be worse, because the Treasury data is based on certain assumptions made by the federal government that are highly uncertain and optimistic. For example:\n\nA paper in the journal Demography found that the Social Security Administration is using an antiquated method to project life expectancies, and as a result, the program \u201cmay be in a considerably more precarious position than officially thought.\u201d\n\nWhen the federal government makes student loans, it projects that it will eventually reap a 9 percent average profit from interest on the loans. However, the Congressional Budget Office has determined that if the federal government accounted for the market risk of these loans, it would show an average loss of 12 percent on every dollar it lends.\n\nThe Board of Medicare Trustees has stated that the program\u2019s long-term costs may be \u201csubstantially higher\u201d than projected under current law. This is because the Affordable Care Act (i.e., Obamacare) will cut Medicare prices for \u201cmany\u201d healthcare services to \u201cless than half of their level\u201d under prior law. The Trustees explain that this may cause \u201cwithdrawal of providers from the Medicare market\u201d and \u201csevere problems with beneficiary access to care.\u201d This would pressure lawmakers to raise prices and thus increase the costs of Medicare.\n\nThe current national debt is $19.1 trillion. This amounts to 105 percent of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product, which is higher than any point in U.S. history except for two years near the end of World War II. The national debt, however, is mainly measured on a cash basis, and as such, it does not include most of the obligations detailed above.\n\nThese obligations are looming, and their consequences can be seen in the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s projections of publicly held debt (a partial measure of national debt). Under current federal policies and their economic effects, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the next generation of Americans will inherit a debt like never before seen in the history of the U.S.:\n\nThe vast bulk of current and impending federal debt is due to increased spending on social programs like Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, and food stamps. Such programs have grown from 20 percent of federal spending in 1960 to 61 percent of federal spending in 2014. Under current laws and policies, the Congressional Budget Office projects that most future growth in spending will be due to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, Obamacare, and interest on the national debt.\n\nAn ideologically diverse array of economists and other scholars have found that present and future levels of government debt threaten far-reaching negative consequences, such as lower wages, weak economic growth, increased inflation, higher taxes, reduced government benefits, or combinations of such results. As summarized by the Government Accountability Office, \u201cthe costs of federal borrowing will be borne by tomorrow\u2019s workers and taxpayers,\u201d and this \u201cmay reduce or slow the growth of the living standards of future generations.\u201d\n\nJames D.
