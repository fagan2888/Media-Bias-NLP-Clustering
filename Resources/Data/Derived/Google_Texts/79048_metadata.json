However, with the increasing likelihood that Julius Thomas won\u2019t be re-signed and Jacob Tamme\u2019s future uncertain, the Broncos cast a wide net in search for tight ends at the NFL scouting combine.\n\nThey met with Minnesota\u2019s Maxx Williams, considered the top player at his position in multiple mock drafts. He could still be available when the Broncos make the 28th overall pick.\n\nWilliams profiles well for Gary Kubiak\u2019s offense. He learned to run block at Minnesota, but was athletic enough to be flexed out in the passing game. At 247 pounds, he clocked a 4.77 40-yard dash, showed strong hands and ran efficient routes. Williams, 20, left school after his redshirt sophomore season.\n\n\u201cThe toughest question to answer (when meeting teams) is why did you leave? Personally I can answer it because I want to be the best, and to be the best you have to play against the best,\u201d Williams said. \u201cCompetition is what makes you better.\u201d\n\nWilliams will attempt to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps. The New York Giants selected Brian Williams with the 18th overall pick in 1989.\n\nThe Broncos also met with Oklahoma\u2019s Blake Bell, a later-round projection. He ran a 4.8 40, showing commitment by practicing his dash on the carpeted floor in the convention center adjacent to Lucas Oil Stadium.\n\nTackling a need. The Broncos need a right tackle. If they don\u2019t sign a free agent \u2014 the Texans\u2019 Derek Newton is worth keeping an eye on \u2014 they will draft one. They might anyway. The Broncos talked with Louisiana\u2019s La\u2019el Collins, a likely first-rounder, Colorado State\u2019s Ty Sambrailo and Utah\u2019s Jeremiah Poutasi.\n\n\u201cI think the system they are going to run is great,\u201d said Collins, who also talked with the Broncos at the Senior Bowl. \u201cI feel like I can fit in any system. That\u2019s just the type of player I am.\u201d\n\nThompson\u2019s knee fix. Undrafted rookie Juwan Thompson turned an eye-opening training camp into a roster spot. He averaged 5.0 yards a carry on 54 attempts during the season, but a knee and hip injury left him inactive for the final regular season game and the playoffs. Thompson\u2019s knee required an offseason arthroscopic procedure.\n\nGeneral manager John Elway said last week that Thompson, a sturdy 225 pounds, could compete for a fullback spot in Kubiak\u2019s offense.\n\nFootnotes. Colorado State quarterback Garrett Grayson did not participate in quarterback drills Saturday because of a hamstring injury, but believes he will be healthy for his pro day next month. \u2026 Georgia receiver Chris Conley delivered the performance of the week, tying the combine record in vertical jump (45 inches) and broad jump (11-7) and ran a 4.35 40.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Briefs: Denver Broncos meet with Minnesota tight end Maxx Williams", "title": "Briefs: Denver Broncos meet with Minnesota tight end Maxx Williams", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/02/21/briefs-denver-broncos-meet-with-minnesota-tight-end-maxx-williams/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150221__Maxx-Williamsp1.jpg", "height": 411}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150221__Maxx-Williamsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-21T20:28:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T23:38:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfae0\"", "article_summary": "The Broncos talked with Louisiana\u2019s La\u2019el Collins, a likely first-rounder, Colorado State\u2019s Ty Sambrailo and Utah\u2019s Jeremiah Poutasi.\nPersonally I can answer it because I want to be the best, and to be the best you have to play against the best,\u201d Williams said.\nThey met with Minnesota\u2019s Maxx Williams, considered the top player at his position in multiple mock drafts.\nGeneral manager John Elway said last week that Thompson, a sturdy 225 pounds, could compete for a fullback spot in Kubiak\u2019s offense.\nHe learned to run block at Minnesota, but was athletic enough to be flexed out in the passing game."}
