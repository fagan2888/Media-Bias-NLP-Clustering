Ted Cruz on Wednesday, calling him \u201cLucifer in the flesh\u201d and a \u201cmiserable son of a bitch,\u201d Cruz has fired back by revealing a secret about Boehner\u2019s conduct during the only major Republican effort to challenge Obama, the 2013 government shutdown.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cDuring the government shutdown, I reached out to John Boehner and I offered for Mike Lee [and] me to go over and work with the speaker. Can we resolve this and actually get something meaningful to stop the disaster that is Obamacare? John Boehner\u2019s response was, \u2018I have no interest in talking to you,'\u201d Cruz said.\n\nThe government shutdown, which occurred from Oct. 1 to Oct. 16, 2013, was initiated by Cruz as part of a real effort to defund Obamacare and protest increases in the debt ceiling, which has continued to rise during the entirety of Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nIn order to end the shutdown, Obama simply had to sign off on the federal budget in the absence of appropriations for the Affordable Care Act, which he refused to do.\n\nThe effort ultimately failed, however, as Republican leaders eventually broke ranks and caved out of fear that a hostile media would blame them for the shutdown and would subsequently cost them the 2014 congressional elections.\n\nCruz had pressured Republican leadership to stand by their principles, and because of this his reputation in Washington tanked.\n\nLater in his response, Cruz linked Trump to Boehner, saying if Republicans want real change, they shouldn\u2019t vote for someone who is friends with the former speaker.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cI will say this, if you\u2019re wondering who actually has stood up to Washington, I think John Boehner has made it crystal clear. John Boehner in his remarks described Donald Trump as his \u2018texting and golfing buddy.'\u201d In the same interview where Boehner called Cruz an \u201cSOB,\u201d he also described Trump as a \u201ctexting buddy\u201d and golf partner.\n\n\u201cSo if you want someone that\u2019s a texting and golfing buddy, if you\u2019re happy with John Boehner, speaker of the House, and you want a president like John Boehner, Donald Trump is your man,\u201d Cruz added.\n\nh/t: Mediaite", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"I have no interest in talking to you ...\"", "author": "Gerry Urbanek", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "\"I have no interest in talking to you ...\"", "title": "Watch: Cruz Just Responded To Boehner's Attack By Revealing A Big Secret He Hadn't Made Public Before", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Untitled-design-22-4.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-29T09:34:02-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/cruz-responds-to-boehners-attacks-by-revealing-incident-in-obamacare-battle/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I have no interest in talking to you ...\"", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Untitled-design-22-4.jpg", "title": "Cruz Responds To Boehner's Attacks By Revealing Incident In Obamacare Battle", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2016-04-28T17:41:49-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Featured Stories", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2016-04-28T17:41:49-07:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T09:34:02-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ted cruz, boehner, inner trump, lucifer, sob, obamacare, john boehner, politics, nation, religion"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3022\"", "article_summary": "'\u201d In the same interview where Boehner called Cruz an \u201cSOB,\u201d he also described Trump as a \u201ctexting buddy\u201d and golf partner.\nAdvertisement - story continues belowFormer Speaker of the House John Boehner drew a great deal of contempt from the Republican base during his time in office.\nJohn Boehner in his remarks described Donald Trump as his \u2018texting and golfing buddy.\nCruz had pressured Republican leadership to stand by their principles, and because of this his reputation in Washington tanked.\n\u201cSo if you want someone that\u2019s a texting and golfing buddy, if you\u2019re happy with John Boehner, speaker of the House, and you want a president like John Boehner, Donald Trump is your man,\u201d Cruz added."}
