Bernie Sanders won in Vermont, which aside from being the state has has represented in the Senate by undertaking the arduous task of sponsoring two bills to rename two post offices in ten years, while showing up to work less than most senators, it's also one of the few places where voters are insane enough to want someone more left-wing than Obama.

Half of Vermont Democrats said they want the next president’s policies to be more liberal than Barack Obama’s — far more than in any other state voting Tuesday.

Which is Hillary's strategy of abandoning her own "historic" pitch or her moderate pitch to just run as Obama II is working. Especially with black voters. But with Dems in general.

Majorities of Democratic voters in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia said they want a continuation of Obama’s policies, along with more than 4 in 10 voters in Arkansas, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Texas. In each of those states, about a third of Democratic voters or less want a switch to more liberal policies.

So the change agenda is dead. Everyone has had more than enough change and few Dems really want a radical in office. Even Obama was smart enough not to run as a radical. Black voters, who make up a large share of Southern Democrats, want more Obama. And Hillary has promised to give it to them. The white Northeastern radical voters Bernie Sanders is popular with lack much standing here.
