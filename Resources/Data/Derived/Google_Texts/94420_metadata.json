REUTERS/Larry Downing\n\n4239327\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner plans to sue the president for executive overreach. Barack Obama says, \u201cI\u2019ll keep taking actions on my own.\u201d\n\nIf Congress wants him to stay within his constitutional boundaries, our philosopher-king reasons, they should enact his preferred policies themselves. Obama told ABC, \u201cI am not going to apologize for trying to do something, while they\u2019re doing nothing.\u201d\n\nOr as he put it in his weekly radio address Saturday, \u201c[I]f it makes Republicans in Congress mad that I\u2019m trying to help people out, they can join me, and we\u2019ll do it together.\u201d\n\nAnd that, ladies and gentlemen, is the kind of deep thought that qualifies one to teach constitutional law at the University of Chicago. Government overreach is just another word for the things we do together.\n\nUnfortunately, the urge to do something so often trumps the niceties of constitutional law and limits on federal power. Republicans aren\u2019t sticklers for these details when their party is in the White House either.\n\nBut it might help to point out that the people the president wants to help out often look very different from the struggling middle-class families he so often invokes. Occupy Wall Street might not realize it, but big government is the 1 percent.\n\nThe president says he is tough on Wall Street. But he supported the $700 billion bank bailout and remains wedded to the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d status quo that leads to such expenditures.\n\nObama and his supporters boast of bailing out General Motors. \u201cOsama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive,\u201d Vice President Joe Biden crowed at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.\n\nBiden\u2019s speech was delivered before General Motors began recalling 20 million vehicles a year and jihadists started recalling much of Libya and Iraq.\n\nObamacare is supposed to be tough on health insurance companies. But the federal health care law mandates and subsidizes the purchase of their product. The administration is ready to bail them out at taxpayer expense. There\u2019s a reason pharmaceutical companies spent so liberally trying to help pass Obamacare.\n\nThe Obama administration is currently stumping for Export-Import Bank reauthorization. The biggest beneficiaries of Ex-Im are Boeing, General Electric, Caterpillar and Bechtel.\n\nI thought, according to the president, \u201cour economy doesn\u2019t grow from the top-down, it grows from the middle-out?\u201d Or that, \u201cRather than stack the decks in favor of those who\u2019ve already succeeded, let\u2019s realize that we are stronger as a nation when we offer a fair shot to every American.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why seemingly boring and obscure issues like the Export-Import Bank matter and arcane ideas like free-market or libertarian populism can help.\n\nLike many Democrats, Obama presents his agenda as fighting big business and the super-rich to protect the economic interests of ordinary people. He wants to fight a \u201csystem rigged for those at the top, and rigged against the middle class\u201d while Republicans just want to dole out tax breaks for millionaires.\n\nWhat if the public saw how even liberal policies can actually contribute to the system being rigged for those at the top? And not just the incidental compromises the president must make to govern, but policies that define his administration, like Obamacare and cap and trade?\n\nYou can certainly find businesses and rich people who have opposed these policies, just as you can find middle-class people who now have health insurance through Obamacare. But big government can also make the rich richer, a part of the story that is less frequently told. Big government and big business sometimes have a relationship that is more incestuous than adversarial.\n\nThis extends even beyond subsidies that obviously constitute corporate welfare. There is a reason some businesses support a higher minimum wage \u2014 including some pretty big businesses \u2014 while their cash-strapped competitors don\u2019t.\n\nSuch a revelation \u2014 combined with tax relief that more clearly benefits working families \u2014 might not revolutionize American politics. But it could certainly flip the usual script. Making government bigger is not necessarily about helping the little guy.\n\nIf Obama is a foe of big business, then Pope Francis is a Zen Buddhist.\n\nW.
