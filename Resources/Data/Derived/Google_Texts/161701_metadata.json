These amendments would reduce annual state revenue by nearly $2 billion if implemented in 2015, meaning state funding cuts to important public investments that drive the state forward \u2013 our public schools, affordable higher education, safe and healthy communities, and modern infrastructure.\n\nColorado, which enacted TABOR in 1992, serves as a cautionary tale regarding the perils of taking such a path. The state suspended the law for five years in 2005 in response to a sharp decline in public services. As a result of TABOR, Colorado went from the middle of the pack to the bottom among states in regards to state support for public education and initiatives that serve children. Regarding Colorado, an updated 2015 report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities highlights:\n\nColorado fell from 35th to 49th in the nation in K-12 spending as a percentage of personal income.\n\nCollege and university funding as a share of personal income declined from 35th in the nation to 48th.\n\nColorado fell to near the bottom of national rankings in providing children with full, on-time vaccinations.\n\nThe share of low-income children in the state who lacked health insurance doubled, making Colorado the worst in the nation by this measure\n\nNorth Carolina has ALREADY experienced erosion in state support for public schools, higher education and early childhood programs in recent years and currently ranks near the bottom among states in many areas. The implementation of these constitutional amendments would all but guarantee a last place finish in every race, every year.\n\nNorth Carolina already ranks 43rd in average pay for our teachers.\n\nNorth Carolina had the largest decline among states in average teacher salaries from 2003-04 to 2013-14.\n\nNorth Carolina ranks 41st in change in state spending per student at 4-yr public universities since 2008\n\nTABOR would make sure that we are unable to boost investments in early childhood initiatives, public schools, and public colleges and universities at a time when doing so is important to North Carolina becoming a more competitive and attractive state.\n\nContrary to the saying that if you\u2019re at the bottom the only way to go is up, if TABOR comes to North Carolina, the only fate for the Tar Heel State is a permanent place at the bottom in regards to our commitment to public education.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "North Carolina had the largest decline among states in average teacher salaries from 2003-04 to 2013-14.\nNorth Carolina already ranks 43rd in average pay for our teachers.\nThe implementation of these constitutional amendments would all but guarantee a last place finish in every race, every year.\nColorado, which enacted TABOR in 1992, serves as a cautionary tale regarding the perils of taking such a path.\nContrary to the saying that if you\u2019re at the bottom the only way to go is up, if TABOR comes to North Carolina, the only fate for the Tar Heel State is a permanent place at the bottom in regards to our commitment to public education."}
