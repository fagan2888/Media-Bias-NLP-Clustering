PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — A federal judge in western Pennsylvania says Catholic groups don’t immediately have to comply with mandates in the federal health care overhaul law.

The Diocese is challenging its participation in the health care program because it would be required to provide its employees with contraceptives.

There were strong words earlier this month from Pittsburgh Catholic Diocese leader Bishop David Zubik as he testified in federal court on the issue.

KDKA Radio’s Joe DeStio has reaction to the temporary injunction:

Bishop Zubik told the court: “The issue with the services in the mandate is that they either go against preservation of human life or involve the actual taking of human life.”

Churches are exempt from the mandate, but charitable organizations, including Pittsburgh Catholic Charities, were not.

Bishop Zubik told the court this is a problem because, “the practice of charity has to reflect the teaching of the church.”

Both Bishop Zubik and Cardinal Timothy Dolan called the services at issue “evil” and say by giving employees access to those services, the Diocese would be “facilitating scandal.”

The judge in the case writes that this is a preliminary injunction.

Some experts believe the U.S. Supreme Court will make the final decision.
