A Mays Landing man who authorities said employed five juveniles in a Stafford drug ring was sentenced to 30 years in prison last week.

Ocean County Superior Court Judge Rochelle Gizinski sentenced Enzo Pena, 29, of Mays Landing to 30 years in New Jersey State Prison, according to the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office. He will be ineligible for parole for 10 years of that sentence as a result of his plea agreement.

On March 21, 2013, Stafford police stopped Pena in the Wal-Mart parking lot near Route 72. During a search of his car and home, authorities discovered more than a pound of marijuana, a handgun with a defaced serial number that was loaded with hollow point ammunition, a second loaded handgun with a defaced serial number, and several thousand dollars in cash, according Al Della Fave, spokesman for the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office.

Authorities said Pena employed five juveniles in his drug distribution scheme.

Prior to his plea deal, he faced a 23-count indictment charging him with, among other crimes, being the leader of narcotics trafficking network, a first-degree crime; five counts of employing a juvenile in a drug distribution network, a second-degree crime; and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.
