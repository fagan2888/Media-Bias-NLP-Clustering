With the use of only two hands, this green move has inversely led diners to skip the salad and go for the entr\u00e9e and dessert, leading to more \u2014 not less \u2014 food waste. According to a recent study, diners who eat with a tray are found to eat more greens, consume less calories, and waste less food.\n\nMicroenvironments are known to influence what and how much people eat and how much they enjoy it. Brian Wansink, John S. Dyson professor of marketing at Cornell University, behavioral economist, food psychologist, and author of the book Slim by Design: Mindless Eating Solutions for Everyday Life, believes cues in the environment shape individuals to eat too much and too much of the wrong food. However, powerful, small changes may help people mindlessly eat less than mindlessly overeat. Wansink\u2019s approach to changing eating behaviors is not done through traditional education but rather by changing the individual\u2019s food environments that lead to unhealthy eating habits.\n\nThe five places that exist in an individual\u2019s food environment where they purchase and consume all of their food are: home, work, school, grocery stores and restaurants. Small but gradual personal changes made by diners and these food establishments could help lead to a healthier lifestyle. Scientific eating approaches like changing plate size and eating with a tray in the workplace or school cafeterias can lead to a reduction in waistline and food waste.\n\nPublished in the journal Public Health Nutrition, Wansink and a team of researchers at Cornell University, investigated how the effect of not having a tray in a university cafeteria impacted students\u2019 food choice. Four hundred and seventeen university students were recruited to consume dinner between a tray and trayless service in two-week intervals for the study. The dinner menus remained the same throughout the alternated tray and trayless dining options.\n\nOn the first night, dinner service was conducted with trays as usual, while on the second night, there were no trays present. Upon completion of their meal, the participants\u2019 trays were collected so the researchers could precisely measure the food remaining. Diners were asked how many trips they had taken to the buffet in one sitting at the university cafeteria. The researchers primarily focused on the percentage of people taking each of the salad, entr\u00e9e, and dessert, along with the grams of food each diner wasted on each of the two days.\n\nThe findings revealed the diners with a tray tended to take a salad, main course, and a dessert because the tray enabled them to carry more. In contrast, the participants without a tray were forced to leave something behind because they were limited to the use of just their two hands. The students with a tray ate 92 percent more of their salad compared with their trayless counterparts who only ate 53 percent more of their greens, according to the news release. The researchers found the amount of dessert remaining was insignificant because those who went trayless were more likely to opt for an entr\u00e9e and dessert, while those with a tray had a salad, an entr\u00e9e, and dessert. Overall, the diners who went trayless were more likely to take less healthy options and waste more food than when they used a tray.\n\nIn terms of food waste, the diners were less likely to eat all of their entr\u00e9e, salad, or dessert on the trayless day. The trayless diners were found to compensate for having fewer items by taking greater portions of these items \u2014 often unhealthy entr\u00e9es and desserts \u2014 which led to greater food waste. Eliminating trays affects food choices and not for the better, wrote the researchers.\n\n\u201cA better means to reduce food waste would be to change the shape of the trays, make them smaller and introducing compartments where food types should go,\u201d the researchers said in the news release. \u201cReducing waste and costs for an eatery should go hand-in-hand with making diners 'slim by design.'\u201d\n\nRather, Wansink and David Just, researcher of the study, suggest cafeterias to experiment with smaller trays or lining trays with \u201cwaste not\u201d labels in their efforts to reduce food waste. The use of smaller plates is a healthy eating strategy conceived by Wansink who says people will feel satisfied because the plate visually looks full. \u201cPeople serve about 22 percent less on this on than they do on your typical 12-inch plate,\u201d he told CBS Pittsburgh.\n\nFood industry and governments can collectively aim to change the food environments in which Americans purchase and consume their foods to encourage healthy eating habits. Simple solutions such as using smaller trays rather than going trayless could keep diners slim and reduce the amount of food waste in the environment.\n\nTo get more of Wansink\u2019s mindless eating tips, click here.\n\nSource: Just DR and Wansink B.
