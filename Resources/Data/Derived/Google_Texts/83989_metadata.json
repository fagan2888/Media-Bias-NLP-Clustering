These essential services play a critical role in student well-being and, therefore, success. Yet funding these services \u2014 and creating access to them for all students \u2014 has been a growing fiscal challenge, and a personal concern of mine.\u201d\n\nThe announcement sent students into protest, including rallies on campus and Twitter hashtag activism under the banner #FightTheFee. Under the Affordable Care Act, better known as ObamaCare, the students on the Ithaca, N.Y., campus not only are required to have insurance, but will pay an extra fee to skip the school\u2019s plan if already covered. The university is passing the costs down to the consumer \u2014 the student \u2014 and they aren\u2019t happy.\n\nStudents who do not opt in to the $2,352 per year plan must pay the $350 fee, which \u201cmost likely\u201d won\u2019t be covered by financial aid, according to campus newspaper The Cornell Review. Ironically, but likely not a coincidence, the university plan is run through Aetna, whose CEO, Mark Bertolini, is a Cornell alumni (MBA grad). In addition the fee, students will have to pay a $10 co-pay when visiting the school\u2019s health center.\n\nCornell Vice President for Student and Academic Services Susan Murphy said in her own statement on Wednesday that \u201cthe fee is necessary to create a sustainable model for health services while also increasing accessibility and protecting student privacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is our responsibility to work together, to make sure everyone in our community who needs help gets it. That is a burden, and a benefit, we all share,\u201d She said.\n\nBut as the Twitter account for the protest pointed out, administrators aren\u2019t exactly willing to share in the burden completely. They do have limits, apparently.\n\nCornell has BILLIONS of dollars in its endowment. It is NOT poor in any measure. #FightTheFee \u2014 Cornell #FightTheFee (@FightTheFee) February 12, 2015\n\nUniversity officials have thus far refused to comment on the possibility of tapping the endowment.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Cornell University, ObamaCare, Health, Cornell health plan, Cornell students", "generator": "PPD News Network", "og": {"site_name": "People's Pundit Daily", "description": "Cornell University students are say they should not have to pay a penalty for not buying the school's health insurance if they already have covered.", "title": "#FightTheFee: Cornell University Students Protest \u2018Health Fee\u2019 Imposed After ObamaCare", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 630, "identifier": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cornell-president.jpg", "height": 354}, "updated_time": "2015-09-02T18:14:52-04:00", "url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/politics/2015/02/14/fightthefee-cornell-university-students-protest-health-fee-imposed-after-obamacare/", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cornell University students are say they should not have to pay a penalty for not buying the school's health insurance if they already have covered.", "title": "#FightTheFee: Cornell University Students Protest 'Health Fee' Imposed After ObamaCare | People's Pundit Daily", "image": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/cornell-president.jpg", "creator": "@PPDNews", "site": "@PPDNews", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/politics/2015/02/14/fightthefee-cornell-university-students-protest-health-fee-imposed-after-obamacare/", "should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/22480", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "package": "com.zeen101.peoplespunditdaily.app.android"}, "ios": {"url": "com.peoplespunditdaily.app://://post/22480", "app_name": "People\\'s Pundit Daily", "app_store_id": 1019177493}}, "robots": "noodp", "BridPlugin": "oauth_token:ef63637f2cb1a477b40092f3568d5f17a64208c9|user_id:1413|width:660|height:371|autoplay:0|site:1938|player:2077|question:1|upload:1|intro_enabled:1|ovr_yt:1|ovr_def:1|aspect:1|visual:0", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "obamacare", "published_time": "2015-02-14T12:05:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-02T18:14:52-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PeoplesPunditDaily"}, "description": "Cornell University students are say they should not have to pay a penalty for not buying the school's health insurance if they already have covered."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd00c8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEffective next academic year, 2015-16, we will be introducing a student health fee for those not enrolled in the Cornell Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP),\u201d read the memo.\nIn addition the fee, students will have to pay a $10 co-pay when visiting the school\u2019s health center.\n#FightTheFee \u2014 Cornell #FightTheFee (@FightTheFee) February 12, 2015University officials have thus far refused to comment on the possibility of tapping the endowment.\nThe $350 \u201chealth fee\u201d for opting out of the school\u2019s insurance plan was announced in a memo school President David Skorton posted on Cornell\u2019s website last week, according to higher education blog The College Fix.\nCornell University students are say they should not have to pay a penalty for not buying the school\u2019s health insurance if they already have covered, and are protesting the new policy at the Ivy League school."}
