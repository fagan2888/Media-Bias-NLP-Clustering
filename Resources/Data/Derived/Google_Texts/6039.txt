The watchdog group Kancare DD Watch held a forum Saturday afternoon to let politicians running in the 2014 Gubernatorial race know about the problems people using Kancare are experiencing.

According to forum organizers, all three candidates for governor were invited; Democratic contender Paul Davis was in attendance and gave a short speech, Libertarian candidate Keen Umburh sent a personal video message and Governor Sam Brownback did not respond to the invitation.

The event took place inside Gracepoint Church near Central and Tyler, lasting a little over an hour.

Several people who have dealt with Kancare and the issues they are having with it spoke at the forum. One woman said that her daughter's wheelchair received approval for the labor of mounting new tires, but was denied the new tires to put on it. Another person said his son was put on a wait list for almost seven years and is still waiting on services.

Sandy Wright's daughter was approved to have a surgery in December of 2013 and the surgery was successful, but was never allowed a followup visit with the doctor. Wright's daughter can use walker and cane after the surgery, but according to Wright, her daughter is now having issues again. "I'm not going away, she is my child," Wright said, "I will keep pushing and working on this."

Paul Davis said that the issue is with Kancare and placing disabled people in that system. He said that if he was elected, he would work to fix the problem.
