We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in the country. How great is that? They are employing themselves and potentially employing others. The bad news is we have 470,000 going out of business every year. And why? They cite Obamacare.\u201d\n\nFiorina appears to be citing Small Business Administration statistics on the number of small business \u201cdeaths\u201d in 2011. This was at least four years before Obamacare\u2019s mandate on employers took effect.\n\nObamacare does not apply to small businesses with fewer than 50 full-time employees. Employers with more than 100 workers had to provide affordable insurance to most of them starting this year. Companies with 50 to 100 staffers have until next year to comply.\n\nThe SBA defines small businesses as those with fewer than 500 workers. Certainly, some small businesses subject to health reform are straining to adhere to the rules. The National Federation of Independent Businesses is a strong critic of Obamacare, saying the mandate is hurting their members and not lowering their cost of providing health insurance.\n\nBut there\u2019s no indication that Obamacare is costing jobs. Few employers subject to the mandate report changing their staffing or hiring because of Obamacare, according to the 2015 Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research & Education Trust survey.\n\nVERDICT: False\n\nTed Cruz\n\nReality Check: Ted Cruz on women\u2019s wages\n\nAttacking President Barack Obama\u2019s economic record, Cruz cited statistics showing conditions worsening for women under Obama\u2019s tenure, claiming Democrats running for president are avoiding the topic.\n\n\u201cUnder Barack Obama, 3.7 million women have entered poverty. \u2026 Under Barack Obama and the big government economy, the median wage for women has dropped $733,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nA review of data from the Census department \u2014 which the Republican National Committee cites when circulating the exact same statistics \u2014 indicates that Cruz is utilizing figures from 2011 and 2012.\n\nCruz is right that between 2008 and 2012, 3.7 million women fell below the poverty line. He\u2019s also correct that in 2011, the median income for women is $732 less than it was in 2008.\n\nEven using updated figures, Cruz\u2019s assertion that women\u2019s income has fallen holds up. The median income for women in 2014 was still lower than it was in 2008.\n\nChanges in Census methodology between 2008 and 2014 make it difficult to precisely pinpoint how much lower median incomes are, though the trend is clearly downward \u2014 roughly 3% lower than six years before.\n\nUnderlying Cruz\u2019s claim is that Obama\u2019s economic policies led to the drop in incomes, an assertion that\u2019s difficult to back up given the financial crisis predated Obama\u2019s inauguration.\n\nBut he\u2019s accurate that based on the numbers, women\u2019s median incomes are worse off than they were in 2008.\n\nVERDICT: True\n\nBen Carson\n\nReality Check: Ben Carson on his flat tax rate\n\nCarson insisted he didn\u2019t say his tax rate would be 10%, saying he merely used tithing as an \u201canalogy.\u201d He said his rate would be \u201cmuch closer to 15%.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Carson told Marketplace that he uses a 10% flat tax because it\u2019s \u201ceasy to work with the numbers\u201d and reiterated that it would be closer to 15.\n\nBut Carson has, at least once, put a more exact figure on his flat tax idea and it was close to 10%. Speaking in Aiken, South Carolina, in September, Carson said his personal income tax rate would \u201cprobably\u201d be 11.5% along with a 4% value-added tax on nonessential goods.\n\n\u201cJust to clarify, I actually think it would be probably be a bit more than 10%. It\u2019s probably going to be about 11.5 %. And it\u2019s probably going to require a 4% \u2014 what would you call it? A value-added tax on non-essentials. That would keep us revenue neutral. We only need to be revenue neutral in the beginning because there\u2019s a lot of waste that could be cut out of our system.\u201d\n\nVERDICT: False\n\nChris Christie\n\nChris Christie on Hillary Clinton wanting to raise Social Security taxes\n\nChristie said Clinton wants to raise Social Security taxes.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the difference between me and Hillary Clinton,\u201d Christie said. \u201cWhat Hillary Clinton is going to say and has said before is she wants to raise Social Security taxes.\u201d\n\nClinton has said that the U.S. needs to look at raising the Social Security tax cap on people who make more than $250,000 per year \u2014 but she has not formally proposed doing so.\n\nOn August 11, Clinton was asked at a Claremont, New Hampshire, town hall meeting about the Social Security tax cap \u2014 the fact that Americans do not pay Social Security taxes on anything they earn above a certain amount. That limit is $118,500 this year.\n\n\u201cI can understand why you\u2019d think that was unfair,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe do have to look at the cap, and we have to figure out whether we raise it or whether we raise it a little and then jump over and raise it more higher up.\u201d\n\nAlthough Clinton has left the clear impression she is supportive of raising the tax, she has not formerly proposed raising it, as Christie suggests.\n\nVERDICT: True, but misleading\n\nDonald Trump\n\nReality Check: Donald Trump questions John Kasich\u2019s economic record\n\nThe Ohio governor touted his economic record, primarily that he created 347,000 jobs as governor and moved the budget from a deficit to a surplus. But Trump quickly hit back on Kasich\u2019s claims: \u201cHe hit oil, he got lucky with fracking. That is why Ohio is doing really well.\u201d\n\nFracking first took off in Ohio four years ago. Since then, it has attracted more than $22 billion in investments to the state, and the industry estimated that it would create 200,000 jobs. However, independent analysts concluded that job growth has not been nearly as robust as first predicted.\n\nIHS Global Insight, an economic analysis company, attributed the improving economy in Ohio to the fact that the manufacturing industry was expanding and that the population was growing slowly. They determined that the auto and plastics industries were the main drivers of growth \u2014 not fracking.\n\nVERDICT: False\n\nReality Check: Donald Trump denies saying Marco Rubio was Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s \u2018personal senator\u2019\n\nIn a question about the nation\u2019s immigration laws, and specifically H-1B visa policy, Trump was pressed about whether he ever referred to Rubio as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s \u201cpersonal senator\u201d because of their stance over those visas. \u201cI never said that, I never said that,\u201d Trump told CNBC moderator Becky Quick. \u201cSomebody\u2019s really doing some bad fact-checking.\u201d Trump was pressed on it again moments later and repeated his assertion.\n\nIt turns out that is exactly what it says on his campaign website in a section about immigration reform proposals:\n\n\u201cRaising the prevailing wage paid to H-1Bs will force companies to give these coveted entry-level jobs to the existing domestic pool of unemployed native and immigrant workers in the U.S., instead of flying in cheaper workers from overseas. This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program. Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal Senator, Marco Rubio, has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities.\u201d\n\nVERDICT: False\n\nReality Check: Donald Trump on filing for bankruptcy\n\nTrump said, \u201cI never filed for bankruptcy, but many, many people did. What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful. Hundreds of companies I have opened, I have used it three times, maybe four times, came out great.\u201d\n\nThe CNN Reality Check team looked at this during the September GOP debate. Here\u2019s what he said then:\n\n\u201cI never went bankrupt by the way, as you know. Everybody knows. Out of hundreds of companies, hundreds of deals, I\u2019ve used the law four times. Made a tremendous thing. I\u2019m in business. I did a very good job. But I will say this: People are very, very impressed with what I\u2019ve done, the business people.\u201d\n\nTrump has never filed for personal bankruptcy. But he has filed four business bankruptcies, which Bankruptcy.com says makes Trump the top filer in recent decades. All of them were centered on casinos he used to own in Atlantic City. They were all Chapter 11 restructurings, which lets a company stay in business while shedding debt it owes to banks, employees and suppliers.\n\nVERDICT: True, but misleading\n\nMarco Rubio\n\nReality Check: Marco Rubio on missed votes\n\nMarco Rubio, defending himself against accusations he\u2019s been overly absent from the Senate as he runs for president, cited previous lawmakers running for president who also missed votes while out on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cThis is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement,\u201d he said.\n\nHe cited three former Democratic senators who ran for their party\u2019s nomination \u2014 Bob Graham of Florida and John Kerry of Massachusetts in 2004, and Barack Obama of Illinois on 2008 \u2014 that he said also missed large percentages of votes as they campaigned.\n\nChecks of his figures indicate Rubio is correct.\n\nRubio has missed 34% of his votes in the Senate so far this year, according to GovTrack.\n\nGraham missed 32% of votes in 2003, the year he declared his candidacy. That rate spiked to more than 70% in the late summer, as the race heated up.\n\nKerry\u2019s absentee rate was even higher \u2014 64% in 2003, and close to 90% in 2004, spiking after he had secured the Democratic nomination.\n\nThen-Sen. Obama missed 26% of his votes in 2007 and 64% in 2008, and skipped almost all of the votes in the months directly leading up to the election.\n\nBut unlike those men, Rubio has said he\u2019s finished with his Senate career, whether he wins the presidency or not. That fact has led to calls for his resignation now, including Wednesday night from Jeb Bush, a Florida resident.\n\nUltimately, however, Rubio\u2019s defense that uses historic data is true.\n\nVERDICT: True\n\nLindsey Graham\n\nReality Check: Lindsey Graham on Social Security and poverty\n\n\u201cSocial Security is not just a concept to me,\u201d Graham said at the undercard debate. \u201cI know why it exists. Fifty percent of today\u2019s seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check. I promise you, if you make me your president, I will save Social Security because I know why it exists.\u201d\n\nWithout Social Security benefits, 50% of seniors would have been in poverty in 2014, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nVERDICT: True\n\nBobby Jindal\n\nReality Check: Bobby Jindal on cutting the Louisiana state budget\n\n\u201cWhat we did is cut (Louisiana) state spending. We cut our budget 26% \u2026 We have 30,000 fewer state employees than the day I took office,\u201d Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said at the undercard debate.\n\nJindal says he cut the budget by 26%, but the New Orleans Times-Picayune wrote in 2011 that much of the decline was due to the petering out of federal recovery funds in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the end of President Barack Obama\u2019s federal stimulus funding.\n\nIt\u2019s true he cut the number of state employees by 30,000. The state government payroll now stands at just under 85,000, down from just over 114,000, according to federal data.\n\nBut what Jindal didn\u2019t say is that his state has suffered from financial shortfalls for years, in part because of the economic downturn and in part because of the governor\u2019s refusal to raise taxes. Falling oil prices have also wreaked havoc. He and state legislators had to wrestle with a massive budget gap of $1.6 billion earlier this year.\n\nVERDICT: True, but misleading\n\nGeorge Pataki\n\nReality Check: George Pataki says Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server was hacked and state secrets were stolen\n\n\u201cWe have no doubt that (Hillary Clinton\u2019s server) was hacked and that state secrets are throughout to the Iranians, the Russians, the Chinese and others,\u201d former New York Gov. George Pataki said.\n\nClinton has said it was a \u201cmistake\u201d to use a private email server in her home during her tenure as secretary of state and has apologized for the confusion it has caused. She and her aides have also asserted that there was no classified information stored or sent on the server.\n\nSince the discovery of the arrangement, the Justice Department is now looking into how the information on Clinton\u2019s server was handled, and Clinton\u2019s aides have turned the server over to the FBI as part of that probe.\n\nThe intelligence community and State Department inspectors general also revealed in July that some of Clinton\u2019s emails contained classified information that was not identified correctly, but State Department officials maintain the information was not classified at the time it was sent.\n\nBut as to whether the server itself was breached by a foreign government and its contents accessed, there were reports in August that Russian hackers tried to break into her server five times. However, reporting by CNN to date has shown that five emails sent to her under the subject line of \u201cUniform Traffic Ticket\u201d were part of a widespread phishing effort dating back to 2011 that was prevalent and that New York State Police had flagged for people to be aware of. While the presence of the emails shows there was a risk of vulnerability to Clinton, there is no evidence she ever fell for the hoax. There is also no evidence the scam was specifically directed at Clinton.\n\nAnd there has been no indication to date of any Iranian, Chinese or other entities penetration of the server.\n\nVERDICT: False\n\nReality Check: George Pataki on Obama\u2019s military budget veto\n\n\u201cBarack Obama is the first president in American history to hold our military hostage,\u201d former New York Gov. George Pataki said at the undercard debate, going on to suggest that Obama\u2019s recent veto of the National Defense Authorization Act was the first time a U.S. president had held up military funding.\n\nPataki was referring to last week when Obama rejected the bill over a disagreement with Congress \u2014 issuing a veto in public for the first time in his presidency \u2014 because of the way it circumvented mandatory spending cuts and impeded his efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay naval prison.\n\nBut at least four of Obama\u2019s predecessors vetoed annual Defense Authorization Acts:\n\n\u2014 President Jimmy Carter objected to the bill in 1979 because it funded a $1 billion nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.\n\n\u2014 President Ronald Reagan sent the 1988 NDAA back to Congress since it shrank U.S. missile defense programs.\n\n\u2014 Missile defense programs were again the problem in 1996, when President Bill Clinton turned down the NDAA since he believed a new defense system violated international law.\n\n\u2014 And in 2007, President George W. Bush vetoed an NDAA since it could have frozen Iraqi assets that were held in U.S. banks \u2013 holding up military funding as two U.S.-led wars were raging in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nUltimately, Obama\u2019s veto of the NDAA will likely have little effect on the Pentagon\u2019s operations. If the budget agreement currently making its way through Congress passes, as is expected, caps on military spending will increase by $25 billion for the next two years.\n\nPataki\u2019s suggestion that Obama is the first commander-in-chief to hold up defense funding over disagreements in Congress doesn\u2019t match up with history.\n\nVERDICT: False", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON (Oct. 28, 2015) -- The Republican candidates for president gathered in Boulder, Colorado, for their third debate Wednesday, and CNN's Reality Check team is spending the night putting their statements and assertions to the test.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "CBS 4 - Indianapolis News, Weather, Traffic and Sports | WTTV", "description": "WASHINGTON (Oct. 28, 2015) \u2014 The Republican candidates for president gathered in Boulder, Colorado, for their third debate Wednesday, and CNN\u2019s Reality Check team is spending the night \u2026", "title": "Republican debate: Fact checking the candidates", "url": "http://cbs4indy.com/2015/10/28/republican-debate-fact-checking-the-candidates/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://tribwttv.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/s055491901-300.jpg?w=1200", "height": 800}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://tribwttv.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/s055491901-300.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@cbs4indy", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@cbs4indy"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Get your Indianpolis news, weather, sports, contests, broadcast schedule, community events, and station profile from Indy's CBS affiliate CBS4Indy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=", "fb": {"pages": 315510655359}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://cbs4indy.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/7952da63e73906af73d23febaa4f6da0?s=16", "application-name": "CBS 4 - Indianapolis News, Weather, Traffic and Sports | WTTV", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBS4Indy", "published_time": "2015-10-29T03:30:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-29T03:30:12+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CBS4Indy"}, "keywords": "national & world, news, politics,", "google-site-verification": "97DFOe8LA-RusExwUtjGnPNTbFPxcebeoCtXwJNFDNg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d41\"", "article_summary": "Fifty percent of today\u2019s seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check.\nVERDICT: TrueLindsey GrahamReality Check: Lindsey Graham on Social Security and poverty\u201cSocial Security is not just a concept to me,\u201d Graham said at the undercard debate.\nOn August 11, Clinton was asked at a Claremont, New Hampshire, town hall meeting about the Social Security tax cap \u2014 the fact that Americans do not pay Social Security taxes on anything they earn above a certain amount.\nI promise you, if you make me your president, I will save Social Security because I know why it exists.\u201dWithout Social Security benefits, 50% of seniors would have been in poverty in 2014, according to the Census Bureau.\nThey cite Obamacare.\u201dFiorina appears to be citing Small Business Administration statistics on the number of small business \u201cdeaths\u201d in 2011."}
