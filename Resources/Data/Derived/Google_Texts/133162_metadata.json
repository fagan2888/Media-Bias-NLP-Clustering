Obamacare will be repealed. Marriage equality will be rolled back. Get excited to visit the wall on the Mexico border \u2014 and get ready to pay for it if President Trump can\u2019t magically get Mexico to cough up the cash for it.\u201d\n\nAnd where did Olson score such a scoop? From a Clinton campaign email.\n\nNow I don't know how many campaign emails you get, but I got tens of thousands of them before I finally killed off my old email address -- my favorite old email address having been harvested by some craptaculent PR firm and sold off to hundreds of other craptaculent PR firms and campaign lists. (I'm still a little bitter about that, if you couldn't tell.)\n\nAnyway, your typical fundraising email goes like this:\n\nDear Friend of Jeb, If Marco Rubio wins the Republican nomination for president, he will unleash his MUTANT STAR GOAT which will consume the Earth with fire. Rubio also has threatened to cut funding to Head Start programs in communities JUST LIKE YOURS. I know that you don't want to see the Earth consumed by fire, and that you understand the importance of small class sizes for pre-K education. So won't you make a small contribution today, right now, of just $3? Together, with your $3 Jeb can save the Earth from Marco Rubio's mutant star goat, and protect vital Head Start education for children JUST LIKE YOURS. Jeb can't stop the mutant star goat without YOUR help! So please click this link now and donate $3. Danny Diaz Campaign Manager Jeb Bush for President\n\nNow, Danny doesn't believe in the mutant star goat, probably because he's a Bible-thumping science denier. But Danny does know that he can scare enough people with tales of Rubio's mutant star goat to bring in a few grand worth of $3 donations. Besides, sending out millions of emails costs essentially nothing, other than the fee paid to whatever craptaculent PR firm stole my favorite email address.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "How to Read the News Like a Pro", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "VodkaPundit", "description": "A brief lesson on how to detect clickbait, starring Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Robby Mook, and a cast of thousands of silly people.", "title": "How to Read the News Like a Pro", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/vodkapundit/2016/01/29/how-to-read-the-news-like-a-pro/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/vodkapundit/user-content/21/files/2016/01/ROBBY-MOOK.sized-770x415xt.jpg", "updated_time": 1464304431, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A brief lesson on how to detect clickbait, starring Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Robby Mook, and a cast of thousands of silly people.", "title": "How to Read the News Like a Pro", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/vodkapundit/2016/01/29/how-to-read-the-news-like-a-pro/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/vodkapundit/user-content/21/files/2016/01/ROBBY-MOOK.sized-770x415xt.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "How to Read the News Like a Pro", "pinterestDescription": "How to Read the News Like a Pro", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "keywords": "Clinton, Trump, Mook, clickbait", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But Danny does know that he can scare enough people with tales of Rubio's mutant star goat to bring in a few grand worth of $3 donations.\nDanny Diaz Campaign Manager Jeb Bush for PresidentNow, Danny doesn't believe in the mutant star goat, probably because he's a Bible-thumping science denier.\nJeb can't stop the mutant star goat without YOUR help!\nFrom a Clinton campaign email.\nTogether, with your $3 Jeb can save the Earth from Marco Rubio's mutant star goat, and protect vital Head Start education for children JUST LIKE YOURS."}
