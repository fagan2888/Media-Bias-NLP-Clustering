At issue was how the Fed will wind down a series of programs that, while controversial, are widely believed to have prevented the U.S. economy from tumbling into a second Great Depression following the financial crisis and the Great Recession.\n\nMeanwhile, at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the House of Representatives approved a bill that, its sponsor hopes, is the first step toward doing away with the Federal Reserve and handing Congress the power to control the U.S. money supply.\n\nRelated: Fed Doves Took a Middle Road on Inflation\n\nYes, Congress. The Congress that has barely been able to pass anything for the past several years. In charge of the nation\u2019s money supply. Sure. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nThe measure, sponsored by Rep. Paul Broun (R-GA), doesn\u2019t seem that radical. It simply calls for an \u201caudit\u201d of the Federal Reserve and the 12 Federal Reserve Banks around the country.\n\nBut Broun belongs to a school of thought that views the central bank as an entity with vast, unconstitutional powers that has been usurping the prerogatives of the Congress for a century.\n\nYesterday, Broun told U.S. News and World Report that he has high hopes for the future once the audit is complete. \u201cHopefully once the American people see what the Fed has been doing over the last 100 years then they will support getting rid of the Fed and going to sound money policy.\u201d\n\nRelated: Can New Economic Thinking Solve the Next Financial Crisis\n\n\u201cSound money policy,\u201d to a casual listener, might seem to suggest a merely \u201cprudent,\u201d or \u201csensible\u201d approach to managing the nation\u2019s money supply. In fact, what Broun and ardent opponents of the Fed advocate is the \u201csound money policy\u201d put forward by Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises, which essentially calls for a return to the gold standard.\n\nThe bill passed 333-92, with majorities of both parties in support. The opposition was made up of 91 Democrats and a single Republican.\n\nThe measure is, most likely, going nowhere. While Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) has introduced a similar measure in the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has shown no interest in bringing it up for a vote.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With the eyes of the financial world focused squarely on the Federal Reserve Wednesday afternoon, the House of Representatives passed a bill that its sponsor hopes will lead to the abolition of the central bank.", "title": "With All Eyes on the Fed\u2026House Moves to Abolish It", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/17/All-Eyes-Fed-House-Moves-Abolish-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03202014_Yellen.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/09/17/All-Eyes-Fed-House-Moves-Abolish-It", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03202014_Yellen.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With the eyes of the financial world focused squarely on the Federal Reserve Wednesday afternoon, the House of Representatives passed a bill that its sponsor hopes will lead to the abolition of the central bank.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd277e\"", "article_summary": "It simply calls for an \u201caudit\u201d of the Federal Reserve and the 12 Federal Reserve Banks around the country.\nYesterday, Broun told U.S. News and World Report that he has high hopes for the future once the audit is complete.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, members of the financial press from around the world focused their attention on the Federal Reserve in advance of the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s statement on monetary policy.\nThe Congress that has barely been able to pass anything for the past several years.\nRelated: Fed Doves Took a Middle Road on InflationYes, Congress."}
