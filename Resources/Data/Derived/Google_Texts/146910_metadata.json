Bernie Sanders recently indicated he believes that sexual assault is a criminal matter best left to the police rather than university administrators. This distinguishes him from his rival, Hillary Clinton, who has vowed to combat student-on-student sexual assault in ways that would inevitably be less friendly toward accused students\u2019 rights.\n\nThere\u2019s another leading 2016 candidate whose stance on campus rape is worse than Sanders\u2019\u2014and he is a Republican: Sen. Marco Rubio.\n\nIndeed, Rubio is a co-sponsor of the Campus Accountability and Safety Act, which would codify into federal law several of Title IX\u2019s most oppressive dictates. As The Washington Post\u2019s George Will put it:\n\nBy co-sponsoring S. 590, Rubio is helping the administration sacrifice a core constitutional value, due process, in order to advance progressives\u2019 cultural aggression. The next Republican president should be someone committed to promptly stopping this disgrace, not someone who would sign S. 590\u2019s affirmation of it.\n\nThe Washington Examiner\u2019s Ashe Schow attempted to get to the bottom of Rubio\u2019s support for CASA and discovered that the simplest answer was the right one: he just doesn\u2019t care very much about due process on campus. Schow writes:\n\nRubio is the only GOP candidate that has seemingly taken a stance on this issue \u2013 and it is a bad one. He has co-sponsored a bill that codifies into law the overreach of the Education Department and ensures that accused students will not have a fair hearing. After the Campus Accountability and Safety Act was introduced in 2014, I sent questions to the sponsors of the bill asking about due process protections for accused students. Rubio's office was one of the few that responded. His spokesman told me: \"This bill does not address this issue\" when asked about due process. \u2026 In a statement from Rubio's press secretary Brooke Sammon, I was told that the Florida senator signed on to the bill in order to make it better. \u2026 There's some words of encouragement there from a potential President Rubio, but the claim that CASA is \"a starting point\" still leaves me with a pit in my stomach. It is not \"a starting point,\" because it will never be fixed if passed. Politicians will pat themselves on the back for having done something, and won't fix the numerous dangerous problems created by the bill.\n\nSchow is right. Signing CASA into law would likely go a long way toward thwarting any possible reform of the Title IX in the future. It\u2019s a shame that on an issue so important to civil libertarians, both Rubio and Clinton\u2014the two most plausible presidential nominees (Donald Trump and Ted Cruz notwithstanding)\u2014largely agree that the federal government has a role to play in requiring college administrators to deny due process rights to students accused of sexual assault.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "GOP candidate has a bad record on due process for accused students.", "title": "Bernie Sanders Is Better on Campus Rape Issues Than Marco Rubio", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2016/01/14/bernie-sanders-is-better-on-campus-rape", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14527997292197.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GOP candidate has a bad record on due process for accused students.", "title": "Bernie Sanders Is Better on Campus Rape Issues Than Marco Rubio", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14527997292197.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "College", "published_time": "2016-01-14T19:35:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "There\u2019s another leading 2016 candidate whose stance on campus rape is worse than Sanders\u2019\u2014and he is a Republican: Sen.
