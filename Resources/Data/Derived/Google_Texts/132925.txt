Residents in a handful of Jersey Shore towns went to the polls Tuesday to cast their votes on school renovation and expansion referendums. Below are the tallies, as provided by the Monmouth County and Ocean County clerks’ offices.

BAY HEAD

The borough’s school district was seeking approval on a $4.3 million project designed to build an addition on the Bay Head Elementary School as well as renovate and improve portions of the building. The district planned to bond $3.3 million of the total project costs. The remainder was funded through a $470,430 donation from the Bay Head School Foundation, $247,930 in superstorm Sandy insurance funds, and $272,950 from the school’s capital reserve.

The referendum was approved by a vote of 328 to 48.

FREEHOLD BOROUGH

Voters defeated a $32,902,400 project to make additions and improvements to the Park Avenue Elementary/Middle School and the Freehold Learning Center.

School officials said the projects — $15 million for the Park Avenue Elementary School/Middle School and $3.7 million for the Freehold Learning Center — are needed to alleviate overcrowding.

The district currently rents four classrooms in West Freehold Elementary and two classrooms in Marshall Errikson, both in Freehold Township, to alleviate some of the overcrowding. Another 346 students are educated in administrative and library space, according to school officials. More than 1,600 are enrolled in the district, which has a capacity for only 1,148 students.

Without approval, district officials said, they may be forced to use split scheduling for students.

The referendum was defeated by a vote of 374 to 272, according to Monmouth County Clerk’s Office.

LAKEWOOD

Township voters approved a nearly $34.7 million bond for installing heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems and roofs at several public schools.

The bond's annual cost would be $55.49 for a property assessed at $300,000, according to district documents.

The state has agreed to kick in $11.7 million toward the cost of the bond should it be approved, Schools Superintendent Laura Winters said.

The referendum was approved by a vote of 2,436 to 1,381.

MANCHESTER

Township voters accepted a $15.5 million spending plan aimed at repairing and replacing aging infrastructure and upgrading the district’s security. The money will replace decades-old roofs, pay for new lighting and security vestibules. The money also will fund a new heating and air conditioning system, which officials said is so old that replacement parts are no longer available.

The faulty air conditioning system may have played an important roll in a mold outbreak at Manchester Township Middle School in 2012. The school was closed for two months while it was being cleaned, and cost $1.1 million to remediate. Only $150,000 of the remediation cost was borne by taxpayers; insurance covered the rest, according to school officials.

Manchester’s last school referendum passed in 2009.

The $15.5 million spending plan was approved by a vote of 2,090 to 1,290, according to the Ocean County Clerk’s Office.
