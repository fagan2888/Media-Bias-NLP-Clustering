Who said baboons aren’t related to man?

During a live report from the Lodi Grape Festival in California, a baboon named “Mickey” (because baboons hang out at grape fests) felt up Fox 40 field reporter Sabrina Rodriguez, and he flashed a “smile” all the way through it.



Rodriguez laughed it off as Mickey tried to “cop a feel” and continued her report. Her in-studio colleagues were clearly amused by the way Mickey the Molesting Mammal smiled widely at the camera throughout.
