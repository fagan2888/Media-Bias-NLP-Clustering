And the reason we started it was when we got off active-duty, we messed up my husband\u2019s claims with the VA so badly that we missed all the deadlines and the claims died,\u201d Simcox said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get all the benefits he deserved. We thought \u201cJeez!\u201d if two JAG officers can\u2019t figure this out, how is the average service member who gets off active-duty going to figure this out. So we decided to become experts.\u201d\n\nAnd they also became innovators setting up a partnership at William & Mary between the veterans\u2019 clinic and the psychology department. Psychology students did mental health assessments of veterans who had been denied a disability claim. The results were include in their appeal to the VA.\n\n\u201cAny veteran who has gone through the process of veterans benefits will tell you that medical evidence is really important to what they do and if you can\u2019t prove to the VA through medical evidence that your disability somehow has to do with your service, then you\u2019re not going to get that benefit,\u201d Simcox said.\n\nAt Stetson she\u2019s forged an even broader partnership teaming up with the University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine.\n\n\u201cTo create a partnership with the medical school for this purpose is a huge boon to the veterans and the VA because not only are we able to help veterans with mental health condition like post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury, but now we can collaborate with medicine on the issues that most veterans have: hearing loss, back problems, knee problems,\u201d Simcox said.\n\nBy the time a veteran walks into the Stetson Veterans Law Institute \u2013 they\u2019ve usually knocked on every door there is to knock on. As soon as they enter the converted one-story home across from the Gulfport campus, they will meet Shirley Wells, a paralegal, and Army veteran who handles intake.\n\n\u201cWe have some cases where soldiers have been looked over for 20-30 years,\u201d Wells said.\n\nEighty-percent of their cases are appeals of denied disability claims, but occasionally they help on unique first-time claims.\n\nStetson law students are a key to the success of the Veterans Advocacy Clinic. They do much of research and reading of files as thick as 1,000 pages. Daniel Flanagan, a second year student, works 18 hours a week at the clinic.\n\n\u201cThis is practical. You don\u2019t get to chew through a case file in any of your other classes. When you get Torts you go through a whole bunch of Supreme Court cases, but you don\u2019t actually sit down with a case file that is a 1,000 pages thick,\u201d Flanagan said.\n\nWhat are practical lessons for the law students can become life-changing cases for the veterans.\n\n\u201cThe people we\u2019re getting are kind of at the end of their rope. They don\u2019t have anywhere else to go,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cFor me, it makes it stressful because \u2018Oh my goodness!\u2019 I\u2019m your last hope. Hope I don\u2019t mess this one up.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not going to happen because their work is supervised by Simcox and other law professors at Stetson.\n\nSimcox is working toward the day when the VA and the Veterans Advocacy Clinic has a strong relationship so they can work together fixing veterans\u2019 benefit claims and getting the assessments right the first time.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "There\u2019s no shortage of stories about veterans who have had their disability benefit claims denied by the Veterans Administration, or their appeals", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/winning-appeals-veterans-denied-benefits", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201503/391268862.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "There\u2019s no shortage of stories about veterans who have had their disability benefit claims denied by the Veterans Administration, or their appeals", "title": "Winning Appeals for Veterans Denied Benefits"}, "story_id": 391230475, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Bobbie O'Brien", "org_id": 671, "dc": {"title": "Winning Appeals for Veterans Denied Benefits"}, "nid": 9828, "datePublished": "2015-03-07", "keywords": "VA Health System, Veterans Benefits Administration, Stetson University", "wordCount": 1056, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde599\"", "article_summary": "There\u2019s no shortage of stories about veterans who have had their disability benefit claims denied by the Veterans Administration, or their appeals paperwork lost.\nThe new director at the Stetson University College of Law Veterans Advocacy Clinic has forged some creative partnerships resulting in an 81 percent success rate appealing denied VA benefits claims.\nBy the time a veteran walks into the Stetson Veterans Law Institute \u2013 they\u2019ve usually knocked on every door there is to knock on.\nWhat are practical lessons for the law students can become life-changing cases for the veterans.\nThe VA claims process can be complex, time consuming and downright frustrating."}
