September 14, 2014. (Photo: By Jenna Esarey, special to The Courier-Journal )Buy Photo\n\nUsing giant stencils and a whole lot of yellow, white and black paint, a quartet of artists created whimsical Creative Crosswalks designs at four intersections in downtown Jeffersonville on Sunday.\n\nUnder the direction of the Jeffersonville Public Art Commission, the new crosswalks were painted along Spring Street at the intersections at Maple, Chestnut and Market Streets, and Riverside Drive.\n\nNew Albany artist Philip Collins recruited some friends to help him translate his vision into a Candy Crosswalk at Maple Street, near the iconic Schimpff\u2019s Confectionery. \u201cI designed it with Schimpff\u2019s in mind,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the waterfront, where Spring Street ends at Riverside Drive, artist Miranda Becht, a Jeffersonville resident, created her Tuneful Fish crosswalk, featuring fish jumping from waves playing musical instruments.\n\n\u201cI was thinking about the waves of the river,\u201d she said. \u201cI was kind of remembering walking around down here with the music playing one night. I wanted to create happy little fish jumping out of the water.\u201d\n\n\u201cPublic art is important for everyone intellectually and socially,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving pretty things to look at will boost the morale of your city and give you something to be proud of.\u201d\n\nOther crossings include a Chicken Crossing the Road and an M.C. Escher-esque Pedestrian Crossing incorporating \u201chidden\u201d walkers in the image.\n\nThe Jeffersonville Arts Alliance, the Jeffersonville Public Art Commission and a Louisville group, The MAMMOTH, created City Canvas as an umbrella organization to manage public art projects in the city.\n\nA call to artists was sent out for designs for the Creative Crosswalks to replace old crosswalks in the Historic Downtown District. Designs had to be compliant with traffic and safety regulations and could use only yellow, white and black.\n\n40 designs were submitted. The 36 others are being held for possible installation at other locations in the city.\n\nPublic art is one of the tools the city is using to boost economic development. \u201cAnything we can do to make our downtown more interesting is going to bring in visitors and business,\u201d said the city\u2019s director of planning and zoning, Shane Corbin. \u201cEvery detail we can add gets people talking about what\u2019s going on down here.\u201d\n\nOther public art projects in Jeffersonville include a massive art piece by New Albany artist R. Michael Wimmer to be installed atop a berm on Tenth Street near the Quadrangle and the installation of artist-designed bike racks downtown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting,\u201d said Dawn Spyker, a member of the art commission and a founding member of the Jeffersonville Arts Alliance. \u201cWe can say, look at our town. Look what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re innovative. We\u2019re inclusive. This just adds to the progress we were already making.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1tTcir5", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Using giant stencils and a whole lot of yellow, white and black paint, a quartet of artists created whimsical Creative Crosswalks designs at four intersections in downtown Jeffersonville on Sunday.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Using giant stencils and a whole lot of yellow, white and black paint, a quartet of artists created whimsical Creative Crosswalks designs at four intersections in downtown Jeffersonville on Sunday.", "title": "Jeffersonville gets colorful crosswalk designs", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2014/09/14/jeffersonville-gets-colorful-crosswalk-designs/15643879/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Using giant stencils and a whole lot of yellow, white and black paint, a quartet of artists created whimsical Creative Crosswalks designs at four intersections in downtown Jeffersonville on Sunday.", "title": "Jeffersonville gets colorful crosswalk designs", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/717327c669493885c53bd006239d810c9ef4f9fa/c=648-0-3240-2592&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/09/14/3of8.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5262a3fca508bc49e1b0aefb92dc445db245ac41/c=972-0-2916-2592/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/09/14/3of8.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/44718bc186ef2bf2a2929512c8afc7138da5ab6b/c=648-0-3240-2592/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/09/14/3of8.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2cccc4549406d22ebdb5e57555edbf9d3eb72268/c=216-0-3672-2592/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/09/14/3of8.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e5e870a9c0be7654263322588184ff7a5ed38936/c=0-202-3888-2389&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/09/14/3of8.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-09-14T19:42:38-04:00", "shorthed": "Jeffersonville gets crosswalk designs", "articleid": 15643879, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a6866234a81c7e41f9230adf9968a10eaba1accf/c=0-202-3888-2389/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/09/14/3of8.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/04bd5dcda406da1f9b1fd3b25a8ab8835a554fe7/c=1215-0-2673-2592/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/09/14/3of8.jpg"}, "gci-asset-type": "story", "author": "Jenna Esarey", "pageclass": "article", "title": "Jeffersonville gets colorful crosswalk designs"}, "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a4d\"", "article_summary": "The Jeffersonville Arts Alliance, the Jeffersonville Public Art Commission and a Louisville group, The MAMMOTH, created City Canvas as an umbrella organization to manage public art projects in the city.\nBuy Photo Stephen Rosenberg, left, and artist Philip Collins remove a stencil from a design on Spring Street at the intersection with Maple Street.\nNew Albany artist Philip Collins recruited some friends to help him translate his vision into a Candy Crosswalk at Maple Street, near the iconic Schimpff\u2019s Confectionery.\nPublic art is one of the tools the city is using to boost economic development.\nAt the waterfront, where Spring Street ends at Riverside Drive, artist Miranda Becht, a Jeffersonville resident, created her Tuneful Fish crosswalk, featuring fish jumping from waves playing musical instruments."}
