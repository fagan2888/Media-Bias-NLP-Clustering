Even with no real competition on the horizon, the senior senator from Texas had been hiring staff, building his network and choking his state\u2019s Internet bandwidth with ads that hinted darkly at Texas\u2019s political future without him. Cornyn, an 11-year veteran of the Senate, may have been named the body\u2019s second most conservative member by National Journal, but after criticizing Tea Party hero Sen. Ted Cruz during the prelude to the government shutdown this fall, he had good reason to fear a threat from his party\u2019s far-right fringe. As chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Cornyn had told sitting senators to be prepared for primary challenges\u2014and he took his own advice.\n\nThere were rumblings of a challenge from several corners. Tea Party leaders had tried to draft Rep. Louie Gohmert, and evangelical historian David Barton had flirted with running. When conservative activists in Texas spoke privately, other names cropped up\u2014like Ted Cruz\u2019s father, Rafael, and Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. So when a challenger came\u2014even if he came, like an undergraduate with a term paper, less than half an hour before the filing deadline\u2014Cornyn\u2019s team was prepared.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut still, Steve Stockman?\n\nYes, that Stockman, the Republican congressman most famous outside Texas for his bombastic use of social media (his Twitter account is legendary, thanks to declarations like \u201cObamacare is less popular than Chlamydia\u201d ) and outrageous proclamations (like his now-infamous \u201cIf babies had guns they wouldn\u2019t be aborted\u201d bumper sticker). For the most part, other Republicans here in Texas seem merely to tolerate him\u2014or, at best, appreciate his ability to fire up the grassroots while maintaining their distance. (One long-time Republican strategist told me the Texas congressional delegation had adopted what he termed the \u201crabid dog approach\u201d to handling Stockman.) Edward Chen, former vice chairman of the Harris County Republican Party, once summed up Stockman\u2019s place in the GOP for Texas Monthly thus: \u201cHe\u2019s a Republican. As a Republican, he\u2019s on our ballot. And that\u2019s about the situation.\u201d\n\nJust to be clear: Nobody in Texas thinks Stockman has a snowball\u2019s chance of winning against Cornyn, and they\u2019re probably right. \u201cThis is going to be an irritant,\u201d says Matt Mackowiak, an Austin-based Republican strategist. \u201cBut it\u2019s only an irritant.\u201d Some argue that a failed primary challenge from Stockman will help burnish Cornyn\u2019s credentials and distance him from his party\u2019s far right. That may be true\u2014and it may be true, as well, that Stockman\u2019s campaign will help break the populist fever afflicting the state\u2019s GOP.\n\nJason Stanford, a Texas Democratic political consultant, sees the race as a useful way to unravel one of the central mysteries about Stockman\u2014one that\u2019s been asked many times throughout his career: Is he serious? \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to admit to the outside world, but there are a lot of people in Texas who think like Steve Stockman. He has a significant constituency,\u201d Stanford says. \u201cThere\u2019s a tendency among insiders here to give Tea Party people credit for not really believing what they say. Stockman\u2019s candidacy will test the proposition.\u201d (Disclosure: Cornyn was a recent sponsor of the political newsletter, Must Read Texas, that Stanford runs with Republican counterpart Mackowiak.)\n\n\"Nobody in Texas thinks Stockman has a snowball\u2019s chance of winning against Cornyn,\" writes Hooks. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo\n\nFor now, it remains entirely unclear what Stockman is looking to achieve\u2014if he really thinks he can win; if he\u2019s segueing to a lucrative post-politics career as the conservative movement\u2019s troll-in-chief; or if, as some speculate, he\u2019s running merely to raise money and retire his substantial campaign debt. Requests to speak with Stockman through his legislative office, campaign and spokesman went unanswered.\n\nWhatever Stockman\u2019s up to, a look back at his political career makes one thing clear: You don\u2019t want to run in a Republican primary against Steve Stockman, even if the outcome is predetermined. Running against Steve Stockman is not fun. Steve Stockman doesn\u2019t just burn bridges\u2014he\u2019ll burn your house down.\n\nAlso, sometimes Steve Stockman wins.\n\n***\n\nIf it weren\u2019t for his career in politics, Stockman\u2019s personal story might be a template for a certain kind of self-made man\u2014the troubled-but-redeemed self-starter Texans love to love. Born to evangelical Christians in Michigan, he floundered young, dropping out of college and falling prey to what he called the \u201cpartying syndrome.\u201d He was arrested a few times, and once faced a felony controlled substances charge when cops found 30 milligrams of valium in his underwear during a strip search. In 1979, at the age of 23, he took a bus to Texas, where he lived for about six months in Fort Worth\u2019s Water Gardens, a downtown public park\u2014a fact he often recounts when telling the story of his life.\n\nThen he got clean, got serious, went back to college. He re-found Jesus. In 1989, he launched his first congressional campaign. Working as a computer salesman in Friendswood, Texas, he responded to an ad placed in a newspaper by Pol-Serv, the political wing of the Suarez Corporation, an Ohio-based direct mail firm angered by veteran Democratic Rep. Jack Brooks\u2019s proposed tax policies on mail-order catalogues. Suarez offered to \u201chelp finance and provide expert campaign help to public-minded candidates who will run against Jack Brooks in the next election.\u201d Stockman became the Suarez Corp. candidate, and Pol-Serv helped bankroll his campaign\u2014providing \"general consulting, brochure production and advertising\" services to Stockman. Pol-Serv treated the services as a loan\u2014but the loan was eventually written off.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "For now, it remains entirely unclear what the Texas Republican is looking to achieve.", "title": "Steve Stockman Can\u2019t Lose", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/12/steve-stockman-john-cornyn-texas-senate-republican-primary-101412.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/12/21/2013-12-11-js-steve-stockman-0012.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,Steve Stockman,Letter From ...,Texas,John Cornyn,Letter From Austin", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "For now, it remains entirely unclear what the Texas Republican is looking to achieve.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Story Continued BelowBut still, Steve Stockman?\n\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to admit to the outside world, but there are a lot of people in Texas who think like Steve Stockman.\nSteve Stockman doesn\u2019t just burn bridges\u2014he\u2019ll burn your house down.\nAlso, sometimes Steve Stockman wins.\nRunning against Steve Stockman is not fun."}
