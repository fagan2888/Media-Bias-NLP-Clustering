Cheaper prices for some policies are indeed showing up here and there.\n\nBut those subsidized prices are largely courtesy of America\u2019s dwindling middle-class, the taxpayers who are footing much of this federal giveaway, along with the 30 percent of Medicare recipients who\u2019ll be hit with as much as a 52 percent premium increase next year.\n\nRead also: Obamacare problems will only increase in 2016\n\nNot only will many working Americans find that their premiums are increasing significantly, they\u2019ll also discover that funny little Obamacare feature that Democrats and the media absolutely don\u2019t want to talk about: skyrocketing deductibles. It\u2019s that little catch that will get you if you or your family happen to run into a medical condition that requires something more than routine care.\n\nUntil you meet your annual individual and/or family deductible, you\u2019ll be eviscerating your savings accounts (for those who have them) to pick up the difference, and that can be a painful proposition indeed.\n\nAs a result, many Obamacare enrollees are being forced, in effect, to ration their own healthcare to avoid getting gouged by those unpublicized and very high deductibles. According to Laura Ungar and Jayne O\u2019Donnell in a special USA Today report issued earlier this year,\n\nA recent Commonwealth Fund survey found that four in 10 working-age adults skipped some kind of care because of the cost, and other surveys have found much the same. The portion of workers with annual deductibles \u2014 what consumers must pay before insurance kicks in \u2014 rose from 55% eight years ago to 80% today, according to research by the Kaiser Family Foundation. And a Mercer study showed that 2014 saw the largest one-year increase in enrollment in \u2018high-deductible plans\u2019 \u2014 from 18% to 23% of all covered employees.\n\nIronically, it is mostly the unsubsidized middle-class policy holders who are choosing these much higher deductible \u201cbronze\u201d policies to mitigate the effects of their higher premiums.\n\nBut this is like playing health insurance roulette. If you can get through 2016 without a major illness you win. If you or a member of your family runs into something more serious, you lose because you\u2019ll have to pony up much if not all of that big deductible, negating if not totally eliminating the advantage of that allegedly \u201clower\u201d premium.\n\nUngar and O\u2019Donnell humanize the stark choices middle-class Obamacare recipients have before them when confronting something a bit more complicated than a sore throat:\n\nLaRita Jacobs of Seminole, Fla., who gets insurance through her husband\u2019s job and has an annual family income of $70,000, says $7,500 a year in out-of-pocket costs kept her from dealing with an arthritis-related neck problem until it got so bad she couldn\u2019t lift a fork. She\u2019s now putting off shoulder surgery.\n\n\u201cHow did we get to this crazy life?\u201d asks Jacobs, 54. \u201cWe\u2019re struggling to pay our bills like we were struggling when we first got started.\u201d\n\nWelcome to Obamanation, 2015 Hope & Change Edition.\n\nAnother feature\u2014not a bug\u2014in Obamacare 2016 is the small matter of those Obamacare fines. Imposed on those who choose not to enroll in a qualified health insurance program for 12 months via either the federal exchange or one of the few state-run exchanges that remain, last year\u2019s fine was negligible. But now those fines are beginning to increase. This year\u2019s fines were either $325 or 2 percent of annual income, whichever is higher.\n\nBut in 2016, according to HealthCare.gov, it\u2019s going to get a lot worse: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have health insurance in 2016, you\u2019ll pay the higher of these two amounts:\n\n\u201c5% of your yearly household income (Only the amount of income above the tax filing threshold, about $10,150 for an individual in 2014, is used to calculate the penalty.) The maximum penalty is the national average premium for a Bronze plan.\n\n\u201c$695 per person ($347.50 per child under 18) The maximum penalty per family using this method is $2,085.\u201d\n\nThis is the administration\u2019s gift to the legions of young voters who supported him in 2008 and again in 2012. The key to keeping Obamacare somewhere within range of solvency is to coerce younger workers\u2014those with generally far fewer health problems than older workers\u2014to enroll in Obamacare plans, essentially subsidizing older policyholders.\n\nBut, as many of us will recall from our own younger days, young people are inclined to think they\u2019re going to live forever, and health-issue free as well. That attitude, coupled with the subpar, post-Great Recession wages being earned by younger workers has led them to prefer the fine to the Obamacare premiums, at least up to this point. It remains to be seen if younger workers will be able to withstand 2016\u2019s much-harsher penalties. It also remains to be seen whether they will be able to connect cause with effect when they confront the ballot box in 2016.\n\nWhatever the case, thanks to the fecklessness of the Supremes, most wage earners not already on Medicare are going to have to confront Obamacare plans and premiums once again, starting next week.\n\nRead also: After SCOTUS decision, watch Obamacare costs\n\nFor the third consecutive year, dates for signing up for 2016 healthcare coverage at HealthCare.gov have changed. The enrollment window this time is between Nov. 1, 2015, and Jan. 1, 2016. (State exchanges may have different enrollment windows.)\n\nAlso note, you\u2019ll need to have enrolled in a plan by Dec. 15 in order for coverage to begin on Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nIn a future article, we\u2019ll address the aforementioned healthcare premium horror show that will confront 30 percent or more of Medicare enrollees in 2016.
