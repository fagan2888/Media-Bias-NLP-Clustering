And answers Ellen\u2019s questions about the disappearing middle class and what can be done to solve the problem. Also, in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness month Ellen put the notoriously private Senator in the Hot Seat to answer some personal questions. With every question, $1000 was donated to Breast Cancer Research. In total the Senator raised $10,000, courtesy of Ulta Beauty, by answering questions like, \"Which Republican candidate would he want to be stuck on a deserted island with?\u201d and \"Has he ever been in handcuffs?\u201d\n\nOn taking the politics out of politics\n\nEllen: A lot of people like you. A lot. A lot of people are talking about you and like you a whole lot. I\u2019ll tell you. I think what you said, about Hillary and the emails, you said \u201cThis may not be political.\u201d And I think that\u2019s the exact thing that people are sick of is people being political. I think people just need to hear you say what you feel. The Senator: I think that\u2019s absolutely right. I think, Ellen, you hit the nail on the head and I will tell you I have been in many, many campaigns in my political life and I am very proud to say I have never run a negative political ad in my entire life and I\u2019ve been attacked a whole lot.\n\nOn the disappearing middle class", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Senator explains why he defended Hillary Clinton on the topic of her emails during the debate.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "fc2caefd8163039c48c3b35b178e0993"}, "og": {"site_name": "WTVR.com", "description": "The Senator explains why he defended Hillary Clinton on the topic of her emails during the debate.", "title": "Bernie Sanders dances onto Ellen\u2019s stage for first interview since Democratic Presidential Debate", "url": "http://wtvr.com/2015/10/15/bernies-sanders-dances-on-ellen/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/v29a7888r.jpg?w=1200", "height": 835}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 572089813, "iphone": 572089813}}, "image": {"src": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/v29a7888r.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@cbs6", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@cbs6"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=572089813", "fb": {"pages": 6860957425}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wtvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1e5f8555355860d96f4528b85609455b?s=16", "application-name": "WTVR.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr", "published_time": "2015-10-15T17:09:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-15T17:09:41+00:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr"}, "keywords": "arts and entertainment, arts and entertainment, politics elections and voting", "google-site-verification": "xp-vKfdwBt7bllcG4eSrgb2mL-O45aD7dIeyF4EmMF8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd91d3\"", "article_summary": "Senator Bernie Sanders makes an appearance on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\" as the Senator dances his way on stage for his first talk show appearance since the Democratic Presidential Debate.\nThe Senator: I think that\u2019s absolutely right.\nAnd answers Ellen\u2019s questions about the disappearing middle class and what can be done to solve the problem.\nThe Senator explains why he defended Hillary Clinton on the topic of her emails during the debate.\nI think what you said, about Hillary and the emails, you said \u201cThis may not be political.\u201d And I think that\u2019s the exact thing that people are sick of is people being political."}
