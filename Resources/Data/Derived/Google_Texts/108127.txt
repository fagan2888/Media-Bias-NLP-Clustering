Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks to guests gathered for a campaign event at Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds Saturday in Davenport, Iowa.

Among the topics that cut across Democratic and Republican lines: the GOP presidential nomination’s current front-runner, Donald Trump.

For rival candidates in the 2016 presidential race, Mr. Trump is still a subject in himself–and one on which they are surprisingly uniform, for now. Here are three quotes.

“He’s just a gifted politician that is appealing to people’s anger and frustration that is quite legitimate… I think that people are going to see that Donald Trump is not a serious candidate, that his message of division is not what we need. We’ve had a president that has not been a commander in chief; he’s been a divider in chief,” said fellow GOP candidate and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday morning.

“He will say whatever he wants to say,” said Democratic candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on the same program. “I think that, you know, there’s a certain attractiveness to people that here’s a guy who says exactly what he believes, untrue as it may be, inflammatory as it certainly is.”

“At this point in time, more than any other time, we need to have– we need to have America united. And we need to have an American president who is going to unite us and not divide us,” said GOP candidate and Ohio Gov. John Kasich on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “I believe that Donald Trump will not be the nominee. I think things will settle down.”
