Might the Democrats help?\n\nLast week\u2019s Democratic presidential debate offered a sliver of hope.\n\n\u201cYes, of course, raise the minimum wage,\u201d Hillary Clinton said matter-of-factly, citing a centerpiece of her campaign.\n\nTop challenger Bernie Sanders again called for doubling the federal rate. And Martin O\u2019Malley touted his record of raising the minimum in Maryland.\n\nFor Democrats, at least, the issue seemed settled and the only question was how much. Should they push for $10, $12 or $15 an hour?\n\nAny increase would have major consequences in Texas, because we have so many low-wage workers and a high poverty rate. If the pay floor rose to $12 an hour by 2020, almost 3.5 million Texans would get a bump, according to the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.\n\nThat\u2019s over 29 percent of Texas workers, and two-thirds would be full-timers over the age of 25.\n\n\u201cThis would go a long way toward reversing the wage stagnation we\u2019ve seen in recent years,\u201d said Paul Sonn, general counsel of the National Employment Law Project in New York, which advocates for low-wage workers.\n\nThat may be wishful thinking in today\u2019s political climate. With strong Republican opposition in Congress, any increase in the minimum rate faces long odds, even if a Democrat wins the White House in 2016.\n\nThere is another path, through Austin, and a majority of states have gone that route. About two dozen cities also have raised their minimums to over $10.\n\nBut most Texas lawmakers oppose the idea. In May, the House rejected a proposal to let Texas voters decide on raising the state minimum. The vote was 92-50 against, and it required a two-thirds majority to pass.\n\nThat sentiment goes all the way to the top. When Gov. Greg Abbott was campaigning last year, he called a higher minimum wage a job killer.\n\nMost people have another take. In a Pew survey last year, 73 percent supported raising the minimum from $7.25 to $10.10. And in four \u201cred\u201d states \u2014 Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota \u2014 voters approved raising the minimum, often by a large margin.\n\nGalvanizing public support and keeping the issue in the spotlight are necessary to make changes here, Sonn said.\n\n\u201cUntil that happens, it\u2019s hard to see a road forward in Texas,\u201d he said.\n\nTexas had 361,000 workers who earned $7.25 an hour or less last year. That\u2019s about 1 in 8 such workers in the nation, in large part because other states have adopted higher levels. Texas also leads the country in the share of residents without health insurance.\n\nThe common link in both is politics and ideology. Just as Texas leaders rejected an increase in the minimum wage, they turned down an expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, even with the feds offering to pick up most of the costs.\n\nMost other states have moved in the other direction on both Medicaid and the minimum wage. Cities, counties and school districts are also pushing on pay.\n\nSince 2014, 14 states and Washington have raised their pay floors, sometimes through ballot initiatives. At least 20 cities have adopted much higher hourly rates, rising to $15 by the end of the decade for Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. Higher pay has passed in smaller cities, too, including Birmingham, Ala., Las Cruces, N.M., Louisville, Ky., and Kansas City, Mo.\n\nEven in Texas, a handful of local governments have adopted higher minimum pay for employees and contractors. But Texas cities aren\u2019t permitted to go further and set a higher minimum wage for all employers; the Legislature prohibited that practice over a decade ago.\n\nLeaders in Dallas and Dallas County have talked about the need for higher pay. They\u2019ve pointed out that their lowest rate is over $10 an hour, but they\u2019ve stopped short of adopting higher minimums for contractors.\n\nOne reason is higher costs for taxpayers. Dallas estimated that it could spend almost $13 million more over the next five years to adopt that plan.\n\nSuch trade-offs are often glossed over, said Bill Hammond, CEO of the Texas Association of Business. It\u2019s easy for people to support higher wages, in part because that helps push up their pay scales. But ask if they\u2019re willing to pay extra for a hamburger and the response will be different, he said.\n\n\u201cAt $15 an hour, you\u2019ll hurt the people you\u2019re trying to help,\u201d Hammond said, adding that he already sees automation replacing some fast-food workers in Austin. \u201cWe believe the marketplace should decide this.\u201d\n\nMost research shows a small impact on jobs from moderate increases in the minimum wage. A proposal to gradually raise the minimum to $10.10 would reduce employment nationwide by about 500,000, according to a study by the Congressional Budget Office last year.\n\nBut about 16.5 million workers would get a raise and 900,000 would be lifted above the poverty line, the report said.\n\nThe current minimum wage has affected fewer employees as the economy has improved. In Texas, the number of minimum-wage workers declined by almost 200,000 from 2010 to 2014, while the number of hourly workers rose.\n\nTo Hammond, that\u2019s a sign that wages are rising for all but the most low-skilled jobs. To others, it indicates that it\u2019s time to update the minimum wage for the first time since 2009.\n\n\u201cIf you leave it in place a long time, it becomes less and less relevant,\u201d said Harry Holzer, a public policy professor at Georgetown and fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThe market will gradually pull people up, but a higher minimum wage would do it more quickly.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @mitchschnurman", "article_metadata": {"description": "With more minimum-wage workers than any other state, Texas needs for the feds to raise the pay floor.", "og": {"description": "With more minimum-wage workers than any other state, Texas needs for the feds to raise the pay floor.", "title": "Who will push for higher pay in Texas?", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20151016-who-will-push-for-higher-pay-in-texas.ece", "image": {"width": 1141, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20151016-ny_minimum_wage_46285781.ece/BINARY/original/NY_MINIMUM_WAGE_46285781", "height": 1280}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-10-18T01:09:23Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-10-16T17:26:37Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Who will push for higher pay in Texas?\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20151016-who-will-push-for-higher-pay-in-texas.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20151016-ny_minimum_wage_46285781.ece/BINARY/original/NY_MINIMUM_WAGE_46285781\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2488178\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-10-16T17:26:37Z\", \"section\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"author\": \"Mitchell Schnurman\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/mitchell-schnurman/20151016-ny_minimum_wage_46285781.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/NY_MINIMUM_WAGE_46285781", "publishtime": "2015-10-16T17:26:37Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5ae4\"", "article_summary": "Even in Texas, a handful of local governments have adopted higher minimum pay for employees and contractors.\n\u201cThe market will gradually pull people up, but a higher minimum wage would do it more quickly.\u201dTwitter: @mitchschnurman\nHigher pay has passed in smaller cities, too, including Birmingham, Ala., Las Cruces, N.M., Louisville, Ky., and Kansas City, Mo.\nLeaders in Dallas and Dallas County have talked about the need for higher pay.\nGreg Abbott was campaigning last year, he called a higher minimum wage a job killer."}
