The Community Health Center in Cowley County is one of five Kansas community health centers to receive funding, according to a Tuesday press release from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.

The Cowley County federally qualified health center is one of 164 approved by the federal government in 33 states and two U.S. territories to increase health care access for nearly 650,000 individuals.

The Cowley County center will receive $704,167 for startup funding. Other centers receiving awards are in Pittsburg, Wichita, Olathe and Hoxie.

Kansas centers were awarded a total of $3,183,334 in Affordable Care Act funding, the announcement states.

Across the nation, about $101 million was awarded to the 164 new health center.

This is the third time the volunteer community group trying to get a clinic for low income and underinsured patients started has applied for the grant. Allen Polen, chairman of the group’s board of directors, said the rejections can be seen as part of the process because each time the group had to reapply, they made the application better.

Polen said he anticipates the clinic’s being available by the end of the year.

The first step in the process of making the clinic a reality is hiring an executive director, he said.
