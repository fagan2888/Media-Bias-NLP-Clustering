It's not even close.\" On Monday, Obama met with Attorney General Loretta Lynch in the Oval Office regarding his legal authority to act without Congress and spoke with reporters about his gun control plan, which includes closing the \"gun show loophole\" of background checks. On Thursday, Obama and CNN will hold a live town hall on gun control. The president's decision to act unilaterally on gun control has already sparked debate among pundits.\n\nThe Washington Post's Philip Bump, citing several polls, observes that the American public shows greater favorability for Obama's gun control proposals than for his methods of trying to implement those proposals. He says that survey data indicates that \"Americans support the major components of Obama's proposals.\" However, he also notes, \"The country is much more split on whether or not Obama should use executive actions to accomplish his goals.\" Thus, Bump surmises, \"The proposals he's outlining are generally popular, even if he isn't. There's a likely reason that these actions are coming now, as opposed to two years ago: President Obama no longer needs to worry much about electoral politics.\"\n\n\n\n[SEE: Gun Control and Gun Rights Cartoons]\n\nJim Geraghty of National Review says that Obama is choosing to push gun control, rather than address other pressing issues, because \"because it's the easiest option.\" He writes, \"Just as the drunk looks for his lost keys under the streetlight because that's where the light is, Obama focuses his energies where it is easiest.\" Geraghty highlights a number of problems Obama could prioritize. He concludes, \"[F]ighting ISIS, stabilizing the Middle East, building a prosperous economy, undoing the damage of Obamacare \u2013 all of that stuff's hard. Obama would much prefer taking a victory lap over his decision to 'tweak a few minor rules around the edges' \u2013 our Charles C.W. Cooke's assessment \u2013 than to actually address any of these serious, worsening problems.\"\n\nTaylor Millard at Hot Air asserts that Obama is \"trying to play on the emotional strings of everyday Americans\" while downplaying the facts about the impact of gun control regulations. Millard argues that the San Bernardino, Aurora and Sandy Hook shootings did not result from inadequate gun laws. He writes, \"So the Left's idea of, 'oh we have to do something,' is washed out by the facts. But this isn't going to stop them from trying to get something done, because facts don't mean anything when it comes to agendas.\" Regarding the town hall scheduled for Thursday, Millard says, \"The question the President should be asked, but probably won't, is this: 'Mr. President, why do you want to pass a law or do action you think will prevent mass shootings, when almost all of the firearms used in mass shootings are legally purchased?' That question will then force Obama to explain why he wants a useless law or action to pass.\"\n\n\n\n[GALLERY: Barack Obama Cartoons]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Op-Ed [Opinion]", "title": "President Obama Says He Will Take Executive Action on Gun Control", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "What everyone's saying about President Obama's executive action on gun safety regulations.", "title": "Views You Can Use: Taking Control of Gun Control", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2016-01-05/president-obama-says-he-will-take-executive-action-on-gun-control", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/1b/ffaacac5de11463727c22e1e9785d8/media:eddaae5dbae94bd19a7c6316d1cefe38ObamaGuns.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "What everyone's saying about President Obama's executive action on gun safety regulations.", "card": "summary", "title": "President Obama Says He Will Take Executive Action on Gun Control"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Jan. 5, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Hayley Hoefer,Obama, Barack,gun control and gun rights,Congress,picks,Op-Ed [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "What everyone's saying about President Obama's executive action on gun safety regulations."}, "article_summary": "[SEE: Gun Control and Gun Rights Cartoons]Jim Geraghty of National Review says that Obama is choosing to push gun control, rather than address other pressing issues, because \"because it's the easiest option.\"\nThe president's decision to act unilaterally on gun control has already sparked debate among pundits.\nPresident Barack Obama gave a live address from the White House East Room Tuesday to announce his plans to take executive action to reduce gun violence.\nOn Thursday, Obama and CNN will hold a live town hall on gun control.\nPresident, why do you want to pass a law or do action you think will prevent mass shootings, when almost all of the firearms used in mass shootings are legally purchased?'"}
