The Erie Sea Cadet Battalion wants to give young people in the area a unique opportunity to test their mental and physical limits.



The Erie batallion of the US Navy Sea Cadet Corps is a leadership program for boys and girls ages 11 through 18.



Officials tell us the program is not a navy recruitment tool, but instead a program to help young people become better citizens.



Students go through combat training, scuba training, classroom instruction, and much more.



If you'd like to learn more about the Erie Sea Cadet Batallion, the open house is on Saturday, April 12th from 10am to noon, and then on Sunday April 13th, from 1pm to 3 pm.



Both open houses are at the Naval Operation Support Center on Old French Road.
