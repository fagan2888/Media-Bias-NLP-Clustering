The Bob Dole VA Medical Center says the electronic wait list was cut down from 1047 veterans a year ago to 157 today.

In a nationwide effort among all VA hospitals, the Department of Veterans Affairs says they are working hard to better serve the needs of veterans.

In Wichita, VA hospital staff say they perform better than most of the nation in both primary care and behavioral health care in terms of getting patients served. The hospital did say that for specialty care, they fall behind.

"Meeting the health care needs of our veterans remains a top priority for our medical center and its entire staff," said Francisco Vazquez, Medical Center Director for the Bob Dole VA Medical Center.

U.S. Representative Tim Huelskamp says there are still problems in the VA that need fixed.

"We have 320,000 employees and many of them do a great job, but we find out the higher level managers...are often not doing their job," Rep. Huelskamp said.

He says that the VA is not always accurate with the information they release.
