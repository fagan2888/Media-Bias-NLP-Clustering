That means no more new mosques or kebab shops.\n\nThe anti-immigration party is striving to be France\u2019s big winner in European Parliament elections next weekend and its leader has been ramping up the rhetoric, describing her appeal as patriotic rather than extremist.\n\n\u201cWe want to be the masters in our countries,\u201d Marine Le Pen said. \u201cThe Austrians want to be the masters of Austria, the French want to be masters in France, the Belgians masters in Belgium, and this is perfectly legitimate.\u201d\n\nThe National Front, which also wants to unravel the European Union and withdraw France from the euro currency, hopes to win up to 20 of France\u2019s 74 European Parliament seats in the Sunday, May 25 vote. It currently holds just two seats, but polls show it running neck-and-neck with the conservative UMP party and well ahead of the governing Socialists.\n\nThe party\u2019s agenda is already being imposed in some French towns following the election this spring of 11 National Front mayors, including Julien Sanchez, who has taken charge in the debt-ridden southern town of Beaucaire. Once a prosperous trade route on the Rhone River, today Beaucaire\u2019s ancient stone center is in disrepair and its unemployment runs at 20 percent, double the national rate.\n\n\u201cWe must give this town a traditional look. \u2026 Tourists want to see a Provencal town,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to see a town full of shops with others\u2019 customs. We will block this kind of commerce.\u201d He said police would patrol the kebab shops already present to ensure they aren\u2019t a cover for what he called \u201cdishonest\u201d activity, such as drug sales.\n\nSince donning the tricolor mayoral sash last month, the 31-year-old Sanchez has budgeted for three more police officers and spent 2,000 euros ($2,750) to save the town\u2019s stray cats from euthanasia.\n\nAnd Sanchez is keeping the EU flag flying atop the town hall so as not to \u201ccreate arguments\u201d \u2014 even as he helps his party\u2019s candidate, Louis Aliot, seek election to the European Parliament.\n\nBut his approach has a harder edge that mirrors the National Front\u2019s call to protect the French identity. In his city, which has a large Muslim community, that means barring more shops selling kebabs, a Middle Eastern-style sandwich, from opening in a central square dominated by derelict storefronts.\n\nElsewhere, the National Front mayors of Henin-Beaumont in the north and Frejus on the Riviera have lowered the EU flags at their city halls.\n\nIn Mantes-la-Ville west of Paris, Mayor Cyril Nauth is trying to block the construction of a new mosque for local Muslims, who represent around a third of the town\u2019s 20,000 residents.", "article_metadata": {"description": "France\u2019s far right on the rise ahead of EU vote", "title": "France\u2019s far right on the rise ahead of EU vote", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "France\u2019s far right on the rise ahead of EU vote", "title": "France\u2019s far right on the rise ahead of EU vote", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/05/18/frances_far_right_on_the_rise_ahead_of_eu_vote/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/france-far-right-culture-clash.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "France\u2019s far right on the rise ahead of EU vote", "title": "France\u2019s far right on the rise ahead of EU vote", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/france-far-right-culture-clash.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Elaine Ganley", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: From the Wires, NewsPARIS (AP) \u2014 For the National Front party, French towns should look French.\nElsewhere, the National Front mayors of Henin-Beaumont in the north and Frejus on the Riviera have lowered the EU flags at their city halls.\nIt currently holds just two seats, but polls show it running neck-and-neck with the conservative UMP party and well ahead of the governing Socialists.\nBut his approach has a harder edge that mirrors the National Front\u2019s call to protect the French identity.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to see a town full of shops with others\u2019 customs."}
