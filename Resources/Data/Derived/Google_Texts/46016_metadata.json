(Reuters)\n\nFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush speaks on immigration and a \"change of presidents\" at the Iowa Agriculture Summit. (Reuters)\n\nJeb Bush was confronted this weekend at a sports bar by young activists who interrogated him in Spanish about immigration reform \u2014 an exchange they caught on camera. He also shared a meal with Chinese exchange students.\n\nBut he was mostly in hot pursuit of people such as Joni Scotter, a key GOP activist who helped Mitt Romney four years ago.\n\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Bush said, pointing at Scotter after walking into the back room at the Pizza Ranch restaurant.\n\n\u201cI loved every bit of the speech, and his point of view is just like the same way I think,\u201d Scotter said after Bush gave a talk.\n\nDoes that mean she\u2019s supporting Bush?\n\n2016 Republican hopeful Jeb Bush criticized the Affordable Care Act and provided his vision for health care at an event in Iowa. (Reuters)\n\n\u201cYes, of course she is,\u201d Bush interjected after hearing the question.\n\nScotter turned around and smiled. \u201cLet me give you a hug, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want a hug? I can do that for you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m from Miami; we do a lot of huggin\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not an official candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, but Bush spent this weekend acting like one at events across Iowa, which holds its first-in-the-nation caucus early next year. His Iowa campaign-in-waiting is beginning to resemble the operation built by Romney in 2012 that resulted in a second-place caucus finish on his way to the GOP nomination.\n\nThe goal for the weekend, aides said, was to get the former Florida governor in front of diverse groups of people representing a cross-section of Iowans across the state. That meant stopping at a Republican fundraiser in Urbandale, an agriculture event near Des Moines, a sports bar in Waukee and the Pizza Ranch in Cedar Rapids.\n\nBush also scheduled private meetings with Republican leaders and operatives who previously helped his father, his brother and Romney.\n\nAt Bush\u2019s side throughout was David Kochel, a veteran Iowa-based Republican operative who probably will become his national campaign manager. Bush has also hired Annie Kelly, who helped Republicans win a competitive House race here in 2012 and will serve as the Bush campaign\u2019s state director.\n\nIt was Bush\u2019s first trip to Iowa since October 2012. At the Pizza Ranch on Saturday, he walked into a tiny back room packed with at least 80 people. He stood in front of wooden slabs inscribed with the words of the Pledge of Allegiance and another that read \u201cHappy Trails to You.\u201d A cross was perched on a shelf over his head.\n\n\u201cI learned a lot about politics as a youngster campaigning for my dad,\u201d he told the room. \u201cI learned how to make mistakes \u2014 I learned how to be humiliated in public and all the things that people aspiring to public life learn to do. It was a joy, and people in Iowa treated all of the Bush family so well. It\u2019s good to be back.\u201d\n\nBush arrived in Iowa on Friday evening to appear at a fundraiser for Rep. David Young (R-Iowa), a Des Moines-area congressman. Bush used the appearance to sharply criticize President Obama\u2019s foreign policy leadership.\n\nObama, he said, is \u201cthe first president since World War II who does not believe that American power is a force for good\u201d in the world. The president\u2019s approach has brought \u201cuncertainty, instability and greater risk\u201d to the nation, Bush said.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Bush appeared at the Ag Summit \u2014 a first-of-its-kind forum hosted by Bruce Rastetter, a successful agribusiness executive and wealthy GOP donor. Taking questions on a wide range of issues, Bush called the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare, a \u201cmonstrosity\u201d and the Environmental Protection Agency \u201ca pig in slop.\u201d He gave mostly wonky answers, but an exchange on country-of-origin food labeling revealed more about his life in Florida. He said that he likes the informational labels and that he planned to shop at a Publix supermarket in Coral Gables, Fla., on Sunday for \u201cIowa beef.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably make a really good guacamole, and I want to know where that avocado is from,\u201d he added. \u201cI want to know where the onions are from and the cilantro.\u201d\n\nBush pronounced the food products as \u201cgua-ka-MOH-lay\u201d and \u201csee-LAHN-troh\u201d \u2014 signs of a well-trained Spanish speaker.\n\nBush had to use his Spanish skills later when immigration activists confronted him in Waukee, crashing what was supposed to be an invitation-only event for potential campaign staffers and volunteers. Black window shades were used to keep away gawkers and improve lighting for videographers, presumably for future television advertisements.\n\nVolunteers, apparently fearful of alienating potential caucus\u00adgoers, let the immigration activists in. Seen on video shot by a cellphone camera, a woman asked Bush in Spanish whether he would repeal Obama\u2019s recent executive actions, including the temporary legal status granted to hundreds of thousands of children of illegal immigrants.\n\nBush responded in Spanish that \u201cwe need to give priority to make them citizens. But by law, not by decree \u2014 that\u2019s like a Latin American dictator.\u201d\n\nWhen reporters questioned him later in Cedar Rapids about the exchange, Bush would say only that \u201cwe need to change the law. That\u2019s exactly what I said this afternoon. We need to do this by law, not by executive order.\u201d\n\nAt the sports bar in Waukee, Bush had lunch with Chinese exchange students brought to Iowa as part of a long-running program in the Des Moines area. He also greeted customers at one table and told them about his \u201cpaleo\u201d diet. Motioning to barbecue at one table, he explained that \u201cI can eat the meat, just not the sauce. Enjoy it.\u201d\n\nJeff and Michelle Overton of Waukee showed up to see Bush after hearing on the radio about his visit.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the front-runner,\u201d Michelle Overton said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want another Bush in office, but I\u2019d be interested in what he has to say.\u201d\n\nJeff Overton said that Bush appears to \u201ccarry his own agenda from his brother and his dad. He\u2019s rumored to have a more liberal approach to things. I haven\u2019t heard that come out of him.\u201d\n\nJeff Janssen, 27, a Drake University law school student and lobbyist, said he was invited to a meeting with Bush after helping in the election of Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) last year.\n\n\u201cIt was great to speak with him,\u201d Janssen said. \u201cI think if he can separate himself from his brother and get the word out about his conservative principles, it\u2019ll help him.\u201d\n\nSome customers didn\u2019t seem prepared to deal with the resumption of national politicking in their state and were more interested in the college basketball game between Iowa and Northwestern. (The Hawkeyes won by 17 points.)\n\n\u201cWho are these people in my bar today?\u201d a customer asked the bartender before Bush showed up.\n\n\u201cJeb Bush is here,\u201d she told the man. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the old guys back there.\u201d\n\nDan Balz in Urbandale, Iowa, contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The presumed candidate made stops across the Hawkeye State in pursuit of veteran GOP volunteers.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ed-OKeefe/147995121918931", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The presumed candidate made stops across the Hawkeye State in pursuit of veteran GOP volunteers.", "title": "He\u2019s not officially a candidate, but Jeb Bush looks like one in Iowa", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hes-not-officially-a-candidate-but-jeb-bush-looks-like-one-in-iowa/2015/03/08/e2693800-c5a7-11e4-b2a1-bed1aaea2816_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/09/National-Politics/Images/465491482.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@edatpost"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/hes-not-officially-a-candidate-but-jeb-bush-looks-like-one-in-iowa/2015/03/08/e2693800-c5a7-11e4-b2a1-bed1aaea2816_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ed-OKeefe/147995121918931"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "e2693800-c5a7-11e4-b2a1-bed1aaea2816"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfa4\"", "article_summary": "Former Florida governor Jeb Bush speaks on immigration and a \"change of presidents\" at the Iowa Agriculture Summit.\n(Reuters)Former Florida governor Jeb Bush speaks on immigration and a \"change of presidents\" at the Iowa Agriculture Summit.\n2016 Republican hopeful Jeb Bush criticized the Affordable Care Act and provided his vision for health care at an event in Iowa.\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Bush said, pointing at Scotter after walking into the back room at the Pizza Ranch restaurant.\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the old guys back there.\u201dDan Balz in Urbandale, Iowa, contributed to this report."}
