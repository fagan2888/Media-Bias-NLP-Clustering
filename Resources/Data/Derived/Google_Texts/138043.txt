The federal government will fund the Insure Oklahoma program through the end of next year, the Oklahoma Health Care Authority announced Friday.

"This funding extension is great news for the thousands of working Oklahomans and small businesses that rely on Insure Oklahoma for affordable health insurance options," Gov. Mary Fallin said.

"Our goal moving forward continues to be securing a permanent extension for this successful, Oklahoma-based program."

Insure Oklahoma was created to help small businesses offer health insurance to their employees.

The state uses money from the state tobacco tax, along with Medicaid money, which is a mix of federal and state funds. The employer and employee also pay a portion of the premiums.

For the 2016 fiscal year, the federal match for Insure Oklahoma is estimated to reach more than $64 million.

The program, which has been in operation since November 2005, currently serves 17,923 Oklahomans with more than 3,700 businesses participating.

Insure Oklahoma is for people who do not have access to group coverage and who earn less than the federal poverty level, as well as those who are temporarily unemployed and seeking work.

Fallin and other Republicans who oppose the Affordable Care Act have pointed to Insure Oklahoma as an alternative to expanding Medicaid as envisioned under the act.

An estimated 127,000 uninsured Oklahomans would gain medical coverage if Medicaid was expanded.
