And the bigger the pool of insured patients, the more leverage a hospital system has to negotiate better rates with insurers.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a challenge to the health insurance companies, who are used to negotiating with provider systems at the local level \u2014 and I think this gives provider systems additional market clout in those negotiations,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nSome of the other findings:\n\nFlorida hospitals have, in general, increased profits. \u201cFor example, based on financial and utilization data from the state\u2019s annual survey of hospitals, hospitals in South Florida reported net income of $827.2 million, or 6.8% of $12.247 billion in net patient revenues.\u201d The net income was $590.3 million the year before.\n\nFlorida hospitals have adopted a strategy of adding inpatient facilities, but at the same time \u201cthe number of inpatient days has decreased or been flat since 2007.\u201d\n\nThree insurance companies have more than half the state market share and \u201cthe proposed acquisition of Humana by Aetna would give the company about 31.5% of the health insurance market.\u201d\n\nThese changes, says Baumgarten, mean even safety net hospitals feel the pressure to find more insured patients \u2014 which literally means moving into richer ZIP codes.\n\n\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but thinking it distracts them from their mission in terms of serving the underserved, serving the low-income community,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nEven with increased insurance coverage and changing business strategies, Baumgarten thinks the high rate of Floridians without health insurance is the No. 1 problem for the state\u2019s health care marketplace.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/negotiating-power-shifts-florida-hospitals-consolidate", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/shared/npr/styles/medium/nprshared/201511/456447786.png", "type": "article", "description": "Listen \n        Listening...", "title": "Negotiating Power Shifts As Florida Hospitals Consolidate"}, "story_id": 456447764, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Sammy Mack", "org_id": 482, "dc": {"title": "Negotiating Power Shifts As Florida Hospitals Consolidate"}, "nid": 12719, "datePublished": "2015-11-18", "keywords": "hospital, hospitals, Insurance, health insurance, Allan Baumgarten, Florida Health Market Review 2015, Affordable Care Act, ACA, Understanding Obamacare", "wordCount": 558, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Listen: The Negotiating Power Shifts As Florida Hospitals ConsolidateA new analysis of Florida\u2019s health care markets finds that as the state\u2019s hospitals consolidate and expand, new business models are shifting the negotiating power.\n1 problem for the state\u2019s health care marketplace.\n\u201cYou have at least three major hospital systems in the state moving in the direction of becoming statewide hospital systems,\u201d says Allan Baumgarten, the health care finance analyst behind the latest Florida Health Market Review.\nEven with increased insurance coverage and changing business strategies, Baumgarten thinks the high rate of Floridians without health insurance is the No.\n\u201cFor example, based on financial and utilization data from the state\u2019s annual survey of hospitals, hospitals in South Florida reported net income of $827.2 million, or 6.8% of $12.247 billion in net patient revenues.\u201d The net income was $590.3 million the year before."}
