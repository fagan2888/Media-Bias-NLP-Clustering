Don’t expect filmmaker Oliver Stone to create a biopic about the nation’s 44th president the way he did about it’s 43rd. The man behind “W.” told AXS-TV’s Dan Rather that he doesn’t think a movie about President Barack Obama would be “interesting enough to film.”

“I don’t think he’s that interesting enough. I think that’s more of a Spielberg movie,” Stone said when asked if he would consider filming a movie about Obama.

Stone then continued by explaining his diss of the “Indiana Jones” and “E.T.” director, saying “I fault Spielberg for his view of exceptionalism. You know, he grew up in that America, he has to sell that idea. Americans like that idea.”

The Academy Award-winning director’s political leanings have been hard to pin down of late. Stone spoke last weekend at the International Students for Liberty Conference, an annual gathering of college libertarian clubs from around the world and was a staunch supporter of former Texas Congressman Ron Paul’s presidential campaigns. He was also pals with the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez, however, and is known for his hatred of the modern Republican Party.

Stone has also publicly criticized Obama, calling him a snake and criticizing him for following in the footsteps of his predecessors.

“Obama is a snake,” he told the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of Japan in a speech last August. “He’s a snake. And we have to turn on him.”
