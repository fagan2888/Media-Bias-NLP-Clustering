For the previous year, actual revenues were 2.82 percent more than budgeted and expenditures were $1.4 million less, resulting in a $3.6 million \u201cnet positive variance,\u201d according to the audit report.Salaries and wages were down by $673,9996 because of an early retirement program the board offered, Hogan noted. But benefits were up $1.3 million due to increases in the required contributions by the district to fund the employees\u2019 retirement plan. The general fund balance stood at $19.2 million as of June 30, up $657,874 from the previous year, the report stated.Resident Judy Sherry asked when the board would discuss how the employee healthcare plans will be affected by the Affordable Care Act. She also questioned why budget surpluses continue each year.\u201cWe\u2019re finding at the end of each year that we\u2019re having a surplus,\u201d said Sherry. \u201cIt\u2019s significant. We\u2019ve become a culture for board members that it\u2019s acceptable that we have a surplus.\u201d She asked what if the district had a deficit.\u201cWhat is the acceptable number we can overshoot or undershoot our budget?\u201d Sherry asked. \u201cLet\u2019s say we had $4 million we hadn\u2019t budgeted for. I assume that\u2019s baked into the budget. Is it acceptable or should we be scaling back? I\u2019d really like the board to think about that.\u201dResident Daniel Webster was unhappy that the draft audit had not been posted to the district\u2019s website prior to the meeting so that he could study it and come in with cogent questions.\u201cIt was not posted in advance,\u201d said Webster. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for the members of the public to provide a 55 page document when people come into the meeting for them to review it. It\u2019s really not fair.\u201dBoard Member Patricia Booker, who is no longer on the finance committee also complained about the lack of prior release of the audit report. And, noting that there were not enough printed copies for the handful of people who came to the meeting, said that she was \u201cequally frustrated as members of the public.\u201d Continued...\n\nWebster suggested that the board come up with a long-term financial plan for the district.Webster said he did notice that a $4.671 million surplus that Hogan had mentioned at an October meeting did not appear in the audit.\u201cI come up with 5.7 million in this report,\u201d said Webster.Hogan said that number had not changed, but the way of accounting for it differed because of regulations.Board Member Susan Michaelson, who is on the finance committee said that she \u201cechoes the question Dan Webster asked. Can you give us a quick and dirty reconciliation how we got from $4.671 in October? How does that relate to one of the numbers on this page?\u201dHogan said, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to identify. This is not the vehicle to do it right here.\u201dBoard President Eric Zajac, who chairs the committee said, \u201cYou indicated the numbers haven\u2019t changed. The question is do we want to include that as an appendix?\u201dHogan said he\u2019d prefer to keep it separate. He noted that their previous discussion had been regarding assigning money for different purposes from the $19.2 fund balance. For example, $1.5 million was assigned to capital projects;$4.2 to capital improvements; $6.6 million to the unassigned fund balance, he said.Hogan also said that the board taken advantage of changing market conditions to refund bond issues from 2005 and 2006, saving $2.5 million in debt service. Tax revenues have also increased from $66 million to $68 million and delinquent real estate taxes were down.Sherry said that an expected appraisal of capital items owned by the district had not come in in time for the audit report.
