Four New York City streets are being targeted for a $250 million safety redesign under a plan by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration to lower pedestrian deaths.

The overhaul would include significant sections of Queens Boulevard, 4th Avenue in Brooklyn, Grand Concourse in the Bronx, and Atlantic Avenue in the East New York area of Brooklyn, city officials said.

The city plans to “comprehensively reimagine and redesign these corridors into safer, greener and more attractive roadways for residents and businesses,” Department of Transportation Commissioner Polly Trottenberg said Thursday in a budget hearing before the City Council.

All four of the streets are major thoroughfares, and are considered to be some of the most hazardous for pedestrians in the five boroughs. Twelve pedestrians were killed and 43 seriously injured on Queens Boulevard between 2009 and 2013, for example, while 12 pedestrians were killed and 58 seriously injured on Grand Concourse, according to city officials.

Ms. Trottenberg said the city plans to spend $100 million alone on redesigning Queens Boulevard.

The city plans to add expanded pedestrian space, medians, trees, and dedicated bike paths under the program, called the “Vision Zero Great Streets” initiative, along the thoroughfares by 2017.
