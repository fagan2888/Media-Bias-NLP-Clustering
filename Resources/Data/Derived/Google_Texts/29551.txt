President Obama’s latest rewriting of the Affordable Care Act may prove to be the last straw. From all quarters, scorn is being heaped on him for his banana republic behavior. Visiting Monticello, Obama told French President Francois Hollande that “[a]s President, I can do anything I want.” Obama calls it a joke; as Glenn Reynolds likes to point out, Obama “joked” about using the IRS to audit his political enemies as far back as 2009. It seems pretty clear that “I can do anything I want” accurately reflects Obama’s views on executive power.

This image of Obama as a tinpot dictator is making the rounds on Twitter; I saw it in a tweet by thriller author Brad Thor:

Meanwhile, Michelle Obama’s office tweeted this bizarrely tone-deaf photo of the Obamas’ dogs decked out in jewelry for dinner:

What were they thinking? I have no idea, but it seems safe to say that the Obamas have lost touch with at least some portion of reality; that is, how Americans view them and the administration’s economic policies. I tweeted the question, “Are they eating cake?” to the @FLOTUS account where the photo was published, but didn’t get a response.

Technically, President Obama’s misuse of executive agencies to harass his political opponents and his usurpation of Congress’s powers by purporting to rewrite statutes by executive decree–the Obamacare changes are not the only instances–are grounds for impeachment. These are, in fact, precisely the sorts of abuses for which the impeachment remedy was intended, and for which no other remedy is adequate. For political reasons, impeachment is not an option, and I don’t mean to suggest that Republicans should start talking about it. But it is at least worth noting that from a legal standpoint, Obama’s banana republic conduct represents an impeachable offense, or series of offenses.
