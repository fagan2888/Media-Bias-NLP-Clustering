shortage\n\nDENVER \u2014 It\u2019s hard to pinpoint the exact moment the Democrats\u2019 battle-tested \u201cWar on Women\u201d strategy morphed from political genius into farce, but a last-minute TV ad released Wednesday by NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado that suggests Cory Gardner\u2019s election would lead to a condom shortage is yet another example of how the Democratic messaging has seemingly jumped the shark.\n\nThat said, the edgy spot attempts to do something new, framing the potential impact of a Gardner win on women\u2019s contraception choices in a way that might resonate with younger men.\n\n\u201cGuys, guys, guys, guys\u2013\u201d a female narrator says as the ad begins over video of a man\u2019s hand slapping at a condom wrapper on a nightstand. \u201cIf Cory Gardner gets his way, you better stock up on condoms.\u201d\n\nAfter giant text reading \u201cBan Birth Control\u201d fills the screen, the ad cuts to a young couple in bed with the male frustrated that he\u2019s run out of condoms.\n\n\u201cCory Gardner tries to deceive Colorado voters on his opposition to birth control and his belief that politicians have a right to interfere in our personal, private medical decisions,\u201d said Karen Middleton, Executive Director of NARAL Pro-Choice Colorado. \u201cThese ads highlight how Cory Gardner is on the wrong side of Colorado values and voters, especially young voters.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have spent much of this year\u2019s campaign against Republican Congressman Cory Gardner attacking his past support for a statewide personhood initiative (since disavowed) and his ongoing co-sponsorship of a federal personhood bill that could outlaw some forms of birth control.\n\nGardner, meanwhile, has blasted Udall for running a \u201csingle-issue campaign\u201d, buoyed by an endorsement from The Denver Post that slammed Udall on that very issue.\n\nHe has also put forth a proposal to make birth control pills available over the counter, arguing that it would make them more affordable for women even though the Affordable Care Act now ensures that all insurance plans cover contraception \u2014 the pill and other forms \u2014 with no co-pay.\n\nUltimately, with only $450,000 behind the campaign, the TV spot won\u2019t have a huge impact in the closing days of the race aside from the publicity the over-the-top spots are generating.", "article_metadata": {"description": "DENVER -- It's hard to pinpoint the exact moment the Democrats' battle-tested \"War on Women\" strategy morphed from political genius into farce, but
