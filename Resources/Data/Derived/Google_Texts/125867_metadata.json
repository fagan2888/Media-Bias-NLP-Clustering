Changing health plans. Physician retirements. Hospital network and insurance consolidations. All are making it necessary for many Americans to find a new primary-care physician or specialist.With open enrollment for health insurance plans just weeks away, millions of Americans will find themselves looking for a new doctor this fall, experts say.Stephanie Haridopolos, M.D., a board-certified family practitioner in Melbourne, Fla., notes that it\u2019s not a decision to be taken lightly. In fact, it may be single most important step you can make to boost your health. A physician who knows you and your medical history well can best guide you good health decisions.\u201cA good patient-doctor relationship can help improve the quality of care by \u2026 giving the physician a better understanding of the \u2018big picture\u2019 and how to help [you] improve: mind, body, and spirit,\u201d Dr. Haridopolos tells Newsmax Health.\u201cIt is increasingly difficult for patients to find doctors \u2026 and it is likely to get worse, not better, as millions more gain health insurance under the [Patient Protection and] Affordable Care Act,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe medical field has long been fretting about an upcoming doctor shortage.\u201dSo if you have to make a switch, what\u2019s the best way to find a good doctor? Four key strategies can help you find a great doctor, according to Dr. Haridopolos and other experts.The best way to find a good doctor is ask family and friends whom they use and trust. \u201cPeople who find their physicians through someone they trust \u2014 a friend, a family member, or another doctor \u2014 [have] the most favorable experiences,\u201d Dr. Haridopolos advises.Medical research bears her out. Nearly three-fourths of patients use the opinions of friends and family members when choosing a doctor, according to the recent Altarum Institute Survey of Consumer Health Care Opinions, an annual survey on consumer beliefs and health care practices.Once you have several recommended practitioners, check their names against the list providers in your insurance network.Online doctor-rating sites \u2014 like vitals.com or zocdoc.com \u2014 can also be a resource, but be aware that these are not always reliable. Still, they may be worth a look to see what other patients have said about any prospective doctors you are considering.Check with your health insurer for doctors and hospitals that are part of your network. \u201cIf you have health insurance, you may need to choose a doctor in their plan,\u201d Dr. Haridopolos notes. \u201cSee if your insurance company has a Website you can use to search for a local doctor who accepts your plan and is affiliated with a hospital that your insurance covers.\u201dSeeing a doctor outside of your insurance network can cost three times as much or more as the standard $30 copay with an in-network doctor.Once you\u2019ve settled on a doctor, be sure to check out his or her background, training, and licensing. Visit to your state health department\u2019s Website, which provides patient and consumer resources to help.\u201cLook for a doctor who is board-certified and affiliated with a reputable hospital,\u201d Dr. Haridopolos advises.If your research checks out, all the doctor\u2019s manager or the front desk, and ask about office policies and the physician\u2019s general philosophy. Does the doctor require office visits for every consultation, or are phone and e-mail communications sometimes OK? Does he or she prefer patient involvement, or not?Also, make sure you ask about:When you\u2019ve identified a doctor you think you\u2019ll like, schedule a pre-exam interview to learn more about his or her style of medicine, approach, bedside, manner, and how well you get along. Treat the meeting like a job interview.\u201cYou can find out some key details about a prospective doctor just by calling him/her,\u201d Dr. Haridopolos notes. \u201cWhen you are choosing a doctor, look for someone who treats you with respect; listens to your opinions and concerns; encourages you to ask questions; [and] explains things in ways you can understand.\u201dShe also recommends asking a series of key questions during a first meeting with a doctor:\u2022 How long will it take to get an appointment?\u2022 How long do appointments usually last?\u2022 Is the doctor part of a group practice (and who are the other doctors)?\u2022 Who will see you if the doctor isn\u2019t available?\u2022 Which hospital does the doctor use?\u2022 Can you get lab work and X-rays done in the office?\u2022 What is the office\u2019s cancellation policy?\u2022 If you have a medical condition, does the doctor have experience treating it?\u2022 If you are more comfortable speaking to a doctor in a language besides English, is there a doctor or nurse who speaks that language?\u2022 Does the doctor offer evening or weekend appointments?\u2022 How long will you have to wait for an appointment?\u2022 Does the doctor keep paper or electronic medical records?\u2022 Does the doctor take questions by e-mail?", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "picking, a, doctor", "pubdate": "2015-09-10T09:23:45", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "Widespread doctor shortages and changes in healthcare are forcing many Americans to switch doctors.
