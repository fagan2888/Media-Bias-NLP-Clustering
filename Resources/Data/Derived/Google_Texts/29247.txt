OTTAWA –- Canada imposed another round of sanctions against 11 Russian individuals and a Crimea-based oil company Saturday.

These latest sanctions come amid reports Russian president Vladimir Putin put military forces in central Russia on combat alert.

Putin continued to amass military forces around the Ukrainian border last week despite a call for a ceasefire from new Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko, who Canada supports.

“Russia’s illegal occupation of the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine and provocative military activity remains a serious concern to the international community,” Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a statement Saturday. “The measures we are announcing today against individuals and an entity that have facilitated the violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial sovereignty will continue to increase economic pressure on those responsible for the crisis in Ukraine.”

Poroshenko last week ordered his troops to stop military operations as part of a so-far unsuccessful peace plan. The current death toll from clashes between police and protestors of around 300 continues to rise.
