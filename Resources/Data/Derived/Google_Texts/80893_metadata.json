The following is a compilation of selected highlights regarding supply chain management intelligence and insights to focus on from the Health Industry Distributors Association\u2019s launch of a Thought Leaders initiative via a series of healthcare provider interviews on behalf of McKinsey & Company (McKinsey).\n\nHealthcare providers mention a tri-fold concern regarding reimbursement challenges: drops in government reimbursement stemming from greater effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), challenges regarding commercial insurer adjustments, and increases in patient payments. Healthcare providers similarly point to the potential of upcoming physician shortages and an increasing aging Baby Boomer patient population as leading healthcare delivery change factors.\n\nConsider amending the process of contracting\n\nThe healthcare industry must collaborate and unite its standardized contracting process, states an interviewed healthcare distributer within the McKinsey data. In terms of best addressing end-to-end supply chain costs, essential points to consider as per McKinsey are as follows:\n\nPartner with customers to jointly assess waste in the supply chain from manufacturer all the way to patient (e.g., logistics, inventory management, data management, formulary development, customer demand management).\n\nThis will require more data sharing and \u201chand-in-hand\u201d partnership.\n\nEnable and promote shared savings goals that generate savings from both physical and data standards\n\nOne interviewed supply chain executive noted that although it is strongly preferred for a distributor to circulate preference items, doing so implies such are merely perceived as \u201clarge, monstrous organizations.\u201d The question, therefore, remains, \u201c[How] could they possibly do a preference item?\u201d In light of such a question, McKinsey, poses two additional conclusions:\n\nExpand the scope of products moving through distribution to improve provider logistics and lower \u201ccost to serve.\u201d\n\nInclude opportunities with physician preference products. This may require diverging from the standard \u201ccost-plus\u201d economic model for distributors.\n\nFocus energies on streamlining, connecting products and outcomes\n\nSupply chain management efforts on behalf of hospitals are focusing on notions of price transparency and disciplined accountability, as RevCycleIntelligence.com reported. Supply chain market growth is expected to jump from 2014\u2019s projection $13.8 million to nearly $14 million by 2019 because of healthcare costs\u2019 continuous escalation.\n\nOne interviewee, a device manufacturer, within the McKinsey data confirmed tools need a hearty \u201cknockout effect\u201d that are associated with bigger beasts, such as outcomes and total costs. Without the implementation of such a concept, the product could essentially merely be given away and lack the needed impact to promote any kind of actionable change, he/she says.\n\nMcKinsey confirms the following 4 takeaways regarding the concept of linking products with outcomes:\n\nHelp providers with analytics on key metrics for which they are now accountable: patient satisfaction scores, readmissions, infections, etc.\n\nRetrain and/or restructure the sales force to ensure that representatives are competent to discuss clinical outcomes, productivity, finance, and other critical business challenges with providers.\n\nIncrease collaboration between manufacturers and distributors to share customer insights, develop proof points, and educate representatives to discuss product outcomes.\n\nEnsure that compensation and incentives support these priorities.\n\nConsidering what is next around the supply chain bend\n\nIn closing, one point to consider in relation to the aforementioned information is that healthcare executives\u2019 cost management concerns may indeed be on the decline, as RevCycleIntelligence.com reported.\n\nMany of the interviewees confirmed success is possible, even as uncertainly within the healthcare space remains strong. Confirmed the CEO of a nursing home, \u201cThe times we are in are unpredictable, but these are the times when transformative change can actually happen.\u201d Nonetheless, hospital executives, as RevCycleIntelligence.com confirmed, are falling short in terms of asset management and the like.\n\nProvider organizations state they anticipate reimbursement cuts will drive reductions in operating margins up by one-third through the end of 2015. Supply chain remains both an immediate and long-term concern requiring further addressing. As RevCycleIntelligence.com reported, a greater sense of transparency within the healthcare supply chain space may save billions of dollars in waste.\n\nAs one Supply Chain Vice President confirmed, the art of supply chain is far from merely delivering boxes. \u201cThere\u2019s a real opportunity for distributers to expand their model by providing logistics support and consulting around distribution/services,\u201d he/she states.\n\nAdditionally confirmed another healthcare executive, \u201cYou need to figure out the value of your strategy and how you can contribute. The bottom line is that our organizations need to figure out how to deliver care more cost effectively.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "The evolution and progression of supply chain and reimbursement tactics and procedures within the healthcare industry serves as a keen present focal point.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/3-strategies-to-improve-healthcare-supply-chain-management", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_2_2321062993.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "3 Strategies to Improve Healthcare Supply Chain Management"}, "twitter": {"description": "The evolution and progression of supply chain and reimbursement tactics and procedures within the healthcare industry serves as a keen present focal point.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_2_2321062993.jpg"}, "title": "3 Strategies to Improve Healthcare Supply Chain Management", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe34ed\"", "article_summary": "As one Supply Chain Vice President confirmed, the art of supply chain is far from merely delivering boxes.\nIn terms of best addressing end-to-end supply chain costs, essential points to consider as per McKinsey are as follows:Partner with customers to jointly assess waste in the supply chain from manufacturer all the way to patient (e.g., logistics, inventory management, data management, formulary development, customer demand management).\nAs RevCycleIntelligence.com reported, a greater sense of transparency within the healthcare supply chain space may save billions of dollars in waste.\nSupply chain market growth is expected to jump from 2014\u2019s projection $13.8 million to nearly $14 million by 2019 because of healthcare costs\u2019 continuous escalation.\nConsider amending the process of contractingThe healthcare industry must collaborate and unite its standardized contracting process, states an interviewed healthcare distributer within the McKinsey data."}
