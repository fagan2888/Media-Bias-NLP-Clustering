LOS ANGELES (AP) — Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuaron was looking for an anti-“Gravity” follow up to his blockbuster space film, and he found it with a rare excursion into television.

Cuaron and sci-fi auteur J.J. Abrams (“Lost,” the “Star Trek” movies) are executive producers of “Believe,” a drama about a child whose supernatural powers put her and the world at risk.

The premise came to him while he waited during “the endless process of special effects” on “Gravity,” Cuaron said at a media event.

“Well, first of all, I wanted to do something in which people were not floating,” Cuaron said, drawing laughs.

“I wanted to do something more grounded, and we wanted to do it with real people, real locations,” he continued. “And I wanted to do something really exciting, but, at the same time, something that would be highly emotional.”

He recounted sharing the idea with Abrams and his reaction: “Wow.”

The pair met more than two decades ago and, Abrams said, “I’ve wanted to work with him desperately ever since. I was a huge fan of every movie that he made, and each one made me more and more desperate to try and figure this out.”

When Cuaron contacted him with the idea for “Believe,” Abrams said, it created the opportunity for him and his company, Bad Robert Productions.

Johnny Sequoyah stars as Bo, a 10-year-old who appears to have won the special-gifts lottery at birth: She can levitate, has the power of telekinesis, can control nature and see the future.
