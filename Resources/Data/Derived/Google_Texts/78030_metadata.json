Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). He\u2019s arguably the most vulnerable 2016 incumbent \u2013 polls in Wisconsin show Johnson trailing former Sen. Russ Feingold (D) in next year\u2019s rematch \u2013 and as regular readers know , the Republican hasn\u2019t done much to help his case lately.\n\nAfter all, this is the same GOP senator who recently got caught up in an odd fight over the \u201cLego Movie\u201d; his ridiculous anti-Obamacare lawsuit was laughed out of court ; and his defense for signing onto a letter intended to sabotage American foreign policy wasn\u2019t especially coherent\n\nJohnson also referred during a recent radio interview to \u201c idiot inner-city kids ,\u201d though he later said he was being sarcastic.\n\nBut if the Wisconsin Republican is scaling back his rhetoric to reflect his odds, he has a funny way of showing it. The Huffington Post reported the other day:\n\nGuns don\u2019t kill people \u2013 media coverage of mass shootings kills people. That\u2019s according to Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who on Friday cited a common argument against journalists printing the names and other identifying details of shooters. \u201cWhy do we have what we consider copycats of tragedies? Well, a lot of it is because this is plastered all over the news and these mentally ill, these sick people see it,\u201d Johnson said in an interview on WRDN, a Wisconsin radio station. \u201cThey want to go out in a blaze of glory. They want to achieve fame.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Johnson wasn\u2019t calling for restrictions on a free press. On the contrary, the senator made the opposite case \u2013 Johnson said policymakers could not \u201callow\u201d news organizations to cover mass-shootings, but that would be, as he described it, \u201can incredible infringement on free-speech rights.\u201d\n\nBut therein lies the rub. As Johnson sees it, news coverage of mass-shootings leads to more mass-shootings, but since we don\u2019t want to infringe upon a free press, there\u2019s effectively nothing policymakers can do to reduce gun deaths.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s really a lot of the reason we haven\u2019t acted, just done something \u2013 is because when you really come up and ask those hard questions, you go, \u2018Yeah, well, it might make us feel good to pass this solution, but it\u2019s not going to solve the problem,\u2019\u201d Johnson argued. \u201cAnd it does infringe upon our constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nThere are two main problems with the argument. The first is that there\u2019s very little evidence, if any, to suggest the perpetrators of mass-shootings are driven by media. In the wake of a tragedy, blaming news organizations may make some feel better, but that doesn\u2019t make it true.\n\nThe second concern is that Johnson, the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, seems to have effectively ruled out working on gun policy as a possible solution. It\u2019s true that Congress can\u2019t stop news organizations from reporting the news, but Congress can take steps to limit Americans\u2019 access to deadly weapons.\n\nJohnson apparently sees such steps as unconstitutional, but Justice Antonin Scalia \u2013 not exactly a moderate on the Supreme Court \u2013 seems to disagree. Remember, Scalia has endorsed \u201clongstanding prohibitions\u201d on firearm ownership from felons and the mentally ill, restrictions on guns in government buildings, limits on the commercial sale of guns, and bans on \u201cdangerous and unusual weapons,\u201d including \u201cM-16 rifles and the like.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "If the debate devolves to \"restrict news organizations or do nothing,\" policymakers won't be able to address the problem of mass-shootings.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/after-mass-shootings-ron-johnson-points-the-finger-media", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "If the debate devolves to \"restrict news organizations or do nothing,\" policymakers won't be able to address the problem of mass-shootings.", "title": "After mass-shootings, Ron Johnson points the finger at media", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/after-mass-shootings-ron-johnson-points-the-finger-media", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/articles/159978698.jpg?itok=oCRtTS3E", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "title": "After mass-shootings, Ron Johnson points the finger at media", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/after-mass-shootings-ron-johnson-points-the-finger-media", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/159978698.jpg?itok=jQjsU3XZ", "height": 553}, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "If the debate devolves to \"restrict news organizations or do nothing,\" policymakers won't be able to address the problem of mass-shootings."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-10-12T11:22:50-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "If the debate devolves to \"restrict news organizations or do nothing,\" policymakers won't be able to address the problem of mass-shootings.", "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "After mass-shootings, Ron Johnson points the finger at media", "tags": "gun-policy,guns,ron-johnson,society,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "10/12/2015 11:22:50 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/after-mass-shootings-ron-johnson-points-the-finger-media"}, "news_keywords": "Guns, Society, Gun Policy, Ron Johnson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d68\"", "article_summary": "They want to achieve fame.\u201dIt\u2019s important to note that Johnson wasn\u2019t calling for restrictions on a free press.\nIf anyone in Congress has a strong incentive to be cautious, it\u2019s Sen.
