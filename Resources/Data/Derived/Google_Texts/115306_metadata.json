As a \u201cPioneer\u201d ACO\u2014one of 32 participating in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) Pioneer ACO model\u2014Montefiore Medical Center in New York appears to be a trailblazer. This year Montefiore achieved the highest financial performance among the 32 pioneer ACOs, according to initial data reported by CMMI; the savings represent a 7 percent reduction in the cost of care when compared against the benchmark CMMI established for more than 23,000 patients attributed to physicians in the Montefiore ACO. The chief medical officer at Montefiore\u2019s Care Management Organization and medical director of its ACO, psychiatrist Henry Chung, M.D., told Psychiatric News that his institution was chosen as a pioneer because its long history of collaborative care management and managing financial risk made it a ready start-up. He explained that a unique facet of the pioneer model is that physician reimbursement is based on fee for service, and patients retain their free choice of physicians (unlike Medicare Advantage, in which patients are assigned a primary care physician and are confined to a network). Henry Chung, M.D., Montefiore Medical Center That means that a principal task for Montefiore is physician engagement. \u201cIf you think about it, since these patients don\u2019t have an assigned provider, we needed to figure out, based on their history, who were the likeliest doctors they would be seeing and try to foster and improve the relationship in the context of an accountable care program,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the physician, that means really engaging the patient, communicating with patients, and letting them know that they are part of an ACO. \u201cAnd it also means letting the providers know that we have an infrastructure at Montefiore to support their patients\u2019 complex needs. We know that many of our Medicare patients are also on Medicaid, and we know that that is a proxy for being poorer and more disabled. So we have really worked hard to let doctors know that when they see such patients, we can support them with care-management programs. And we can use claims data to stratify patients and reach out to the highest utilizers and most complex cases.\u201d Last month Chung received the 2012 Lewis and Jack Rudin New York Prize for Medicine and Health from the New York Academy of Medicine (NYAM) and the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA) Foundation. The award was established in 2003 by the NYAM and GNYHA, together with the Rudin Family Foundation, to honor medical professionals from New York City institutions working toward integrated care to address prevention, community health, and health policy issues.\n\nPsychiatry Adds Value Section: Choose Top of page Abstract Psychiatry Adds Value << Reach Out to Medical Coll... Chung said Montefiore has found what many physician practices and health systems entering the integrated care arena have found: that the highest utilizers are often patients with comorbid general medical and psychiatric conditions. \u201cWe have found that a third of our patients have had some form of diagnosed behavioral disorder in the past three years,\u201d he said. \u201cThat one-third has 50 percent to 60 percent higher costs in utilization than patients who don\u2019t have those disorders.\u201d He said Montefiore has been especially aggressive in having primary care physicians use the PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 to screen for depression. \u201cEven before I came to Montefiore three years ago, the institution\u2019s Care Management Organization and the Department of Psychiatry embarked on an educational campaign, with help from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, directed toward our primary care physicians around depression screening using the PHQ-9,\u201d Chung said. \u201cSo when I came here three years ago, depression screening was already embedded in a large number of our primary care practices.\u201d Chung explained that in the ACO model as envisioned in the Affordable Care Act, any cost savings achieved are prorated according to how well the organization performs on 33 quality measures (one of which includes screening for depression and documentation of follow-up). \u201cTraditionally, so much of health care has been driven by the convenience of the health care system, rather than what\u2019s good for the patient,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to get that patient out of the hospital as quickly as possible, you aren\u2019t going to spend a lot of time investing in aftercare.\u201d But under \u201cbundled payment\u201d arrangements in the ACO model, specialists take on a fixed payment for a procedure and all follow-up care for up to 90 days after the procedure. That incentivizes collaboration across disciplines toward achieving optimal patient outcomes. And it is an arrangement in which psychiatry can add enormous value. \u201cAt Montefiore, our Cardiology Department on its own has invested in a half-time psychiatrist to manage psychiatric conditions associated with cardiovascular disease,\u201d he said. It is also a system that encourages novel ways of thinking about how to improve care. Chung said Montefiore has embarked on a pilot program to have a geriatric psychiatrist embedded in the evaluation of patients admitted to the medical inpatient unit. \u201cTypically, consultation-liaison [C-L] psychiatrists are called in too late,\u201d he said. \u201cHistorically, the C-L psychiatrist is often called the day before discharge. Especially as lengths of stay have gotten shorter, that is too short a period to help the patient or make a dent in decreasing the possibility of re-admission. \u201cGeriatric psychiatrists are comfortable in medical settings, and they get a lot of exposure to community-based settings,\u201d he said. \u201cSo they are thinking from day one about diagnosis, treatment, and aftercare, about where this patient can get home care and community-based mental health and social services after discharge.\u201d\n\nReach Out to Medical Colleagues Section: Choose Top of page Abstract Psychiatry Adds Value Reach Out to Medical Coll... << So how can APA members working in other kinds of settings and other parts of the country use the lessons of Montefiore\u2019s success in their own \u201cmedical neighborhoods\u201d? \u201cOur friends in primary care and specialty medicine are actually very aware of the need for behavioral health and are actively seeking partnerships,\u201d Chung said. \u201cI would like to see APA members cultivate those relationships. And they should not stop there but should ask their primary care and specialty colleagues how they can be helpful in improving outcomes for their patients. At the structural level, I would be out trying to find the ACOs in my area and how I can be at the table with them. Many of these changes are being driven by primary care, so that\u2019s where our members need to go. We can\u2019t be in our office just waiting for referrals.\u201d \u25a0\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"dc.Description": "The payment system for accountable care organizations creates incentives for collaboration and novel ways of improving care.", "pbContext": ";journal:journal:pn;issue:issue:10.1176/pn.2014.49.issue-1;page:string:Article/Chapter View;article:article:10.1176/appi.pn.2014.1a16;website:website:psychnews-site;wgroup:string:Default Website Group;pageGroup:string:Publication Pages;subPage:string:Full Text", "dc.Format": "text/HTML", "dc.Identifier": "10.1176/appi.pn.2014.1a16", "dc.Type": "news", "dc.Publisher": "American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc.", "citation_journal_title": "Psychiatrics News", "dc.Date": "2014-01-02", "dc.Creator": "Mark Moran", "dc.Source": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.pn.2014.1a16", "dc.Coverage": "world", "keywords": "Accountable Care Organization, Montefiore Medical Center, Henry Chung, M.D., Pioneer ACO, Cost savings, Quality measures", "dc.Subject": "Accountable Care Organization; Montefiore Medical Center; Henry Chung, M.D.; Pioneer ACO; Cost savings; Quality measures", "dc.Language": "en", "dc.Title": "Psychiatrist Leads Effort to Integrate Care at Pioneer ACO"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd317f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cTraditionally, so much of health care has been driven by the convenience of the health care system, rather than what\u2019s good for the patient,\u201d he said.\nMany of these changes are being driven by primary care, so that\u2019s where our members need to go.\nHenry Chung, M.D., Montefiore Medical Center That means that a principal task for Montefiore is physician engagement.\nAnd they should not stop there but should ask their primary care and specialty colleagues how they can be helpful in improving outcomes for their patients.\nAs a \u201cPioneer\u201d ACO\u2014one of 32 participating in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) Pioneer ACO model\u2014Montefiore Medical Center in New York appears to be a trailblazer."}
