PAHO/WHO, CC BY-ND 2.0\n\nWhether skin-to-skin contact has lifelong benefits for infants is still unknown, but new research suggests the technique known as \u201ckangaroo care\u201d \u2014 incubating a premature baby through maternal body heat \u2014 fosters physical and mental health benefits through a child\u2019s 10th birthday.\n\nResearchers from Bar-Ilan University have found that mothers who care for their premature babies through kangaroo care (KC) confer a raft of psychological and cognitive benefits, such as more organized sleep and better stress responses, which extend into the fragile stage of adolescence. Such a finding may have implications for how physicians advise the mothers of premature babies in caring for their newborns.\n\n\"In this decade-long study, we show for the first time that providing maternal-newborn skin-to-skin contact to premature infants in the neonatal period improves children's functioning ten years later in systems shown to be sensitive to early maternal deprivation in animal research,\" researcher Dr. Ruth Feldman said in a statement.\n\nFeldman and her colleagues recruited 73 mothers to practice the skin-to-skin rearing method, which was originally developed in 1978 Colombia as an alternative to the shortage of working incubators. These mothers held their children close once daily for 14 straight days. Meanwhile, the team monitored 73 infants who received standard incubator care, tracking both groups\u2019 progress at seven intervals in the first 10 years of the children\u2019s lives.\n\nWithin the first six months, differences had already begun to emerge. Mothers in the KC group showed greater outward displays of maternal behavior with their children who themselves demonstrated stronger cognitive skills than those of the incubator group. These also included exercises requiring control and executive abilities, which the researchers observed all the way through the first 10 years.\n\nAt 10 years old, the KC-raised children were leaps ahead of the children raised in incubators. They had better sleep patterns and neuroendocrine responses to stress, more mature functioning of the autonomic nervous system, and better cognitive control, suggesting to researchers a direct link between maternal contact and the raft of psychosocial benefits bestowed upon their children. \u201cThis study reminds us once again of the profound long-term consequences of maternal contact,\" commented Dr. John Krystal, editor of Biological Psychiatry, where the study was published. \"The enhanced level of stimulation provided by this contact seems to positively influence the development of the brain and to deepen the relationship between mother and child.\"\n\nAs more than one in eight children born in the United States each year are premature, finding ways to reduce children\u2019s risk of death and disorder remains urgent. A birth is considered premature if it takes place before the 37th week of gestation. Overweight women, women who have delivered preterm before, and women who abuse alcohol and drugs while pregnant face a greater risk for premature delivery.\n\nIf such a delivery arises, Feldman says, mothers should consider KC as a viable method of care, as it has an \u201ceasy-to-apply intervention with minimal cost\u201d and a \u201cmulti-dimensional long-term impact on child development,\u201d which, Feldman argues, \u201ccalls to integrate this intervention in the care-practices of premature infants across the world.\"\n\nSource: Feldman R, Rosenthal Z, Eidelman A.
