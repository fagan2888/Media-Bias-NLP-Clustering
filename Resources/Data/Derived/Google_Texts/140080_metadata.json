Still, the record is also one of the most interesting artifacts of the Athens, Georgia, group\u2019s career. First of all, it was unexpected: After previous attempts to make a rock-oriented album yielded two decidedly quieter affairs\u20131991\u2019s \u201cOut Of Time\u201d and 1992\u2019s \u201cAutomatic for the People\u201d\u2013the band finally succeeded in crafting a loud, brash record suitable for live concerts. Second (and perhaps most important), the album was a thematic curveball akin to U2\u2019s 1991 opus \u201cAchtung Baby,\u201d in that R.E.M. toyed with their own mythology and decidedly tried not to sound like themselves.\n\nAs guitarist Peter Buck put it in David Buckley\u2019s \u201cR.E.M.: Fiction, An Alternative Biography\u201d: \u201cThe whole record was a kind of reaction to having people following us around to a big degree, making the news in all these weird ways. \u2026 I would say that this was the only time where [vocalist Michael Stipe\u2019s] done characters that are creepy, and I don\u2019t know if people got that. He was getting out his things by acting out these parts that are not him. He took the mantle of front person to a degree he hadn\u2019t done in the past. It is a record that is our least direct and our tour was the least direct. \u2026 I think it was all character-driven in a way\u2013let\u2019s be someone else for a while.\u201d\n\nThis personality shapeshifting didn\u2019t hurt \u201cMonster\u201d commercially: The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard charts, sold 4 million copies and spawned several hits. Time has also been kind to the record, which sounds far weirder\u2013and far more subversive\u2013than it did at the time. And like many R.E.M. albums, its themes\u2013ruminations on obsession, identity and fame\u2013seem eerily prescient and timeless.\n\nWhile there\u2019s no real bad song on \u201cMonster,\u201d we decided to revisit the album and rank its songs. In ascending order:\n\n12. \u201cBang and Blame\u201d\n\nThe band\u2019s last Top 40 hit has, over time, also come to feel like one of its most dated singles\u2013and one of its least-essential songs. The protagonist is smugly satisfied that a deceitful person is getting their comeuppance and is refusing to be a victim anymore\u2013\u201cStop laying blame/You know that\u2019s not my thing\u201d\u2013although an exact motive for this vindictiveness is never clear. The song\u2019s charred riffs and explosive chorus are engaging, but not as innovative as other moments on \u201cMonster.\u201d\n\n11. \u201cTongue\u201d\n\nMusically, the weakest link on \u201cMonster\u201d is the delicate, piano- and organ-driven \u201cTongue,\u201d an homage to genteel baroque pop that would eventually be overshadowed by plenty of moments on 1998\u2019s \u201cUp\u201d and 2001\u2019s \u201cReveal.\u201d Still, the lyrics are far worthier: Written from the perspective of a woman who rues her inability to resist a paramour who is simply using her for sex, \u201cTongue\u201d adroitly captures the feeling of self-loathing intrinsic to such a situation.\n\n10. \u201cYou\u201d\n\nThe \u201cMonster\u201d album-closer is mesmerizing, with an underbelly of sludgy, droning buzz overlaid with coiled rhythm guitars and wild-eyed declarations of all-consuming desire and obsession (\u201cI can wing around your Saturn smile, shout at the moon,\u201d \u201cAnd I want you like a Pisces rising\u201d). Yet it\u2019s also the most unsettling song on a record full of both blatant and subtle unease; the relationship described in the song isn\u2019t necessarily consensual\u2013and it\u2019s not necessarily going to have a happy ending. Either way, it\u2019s an appropriate capper for an album that never goes for easy answers.\n\n9. \u201cCircus Envy\u201d\n\nOne of those subtly genius songs, \u201cCircus Envy\u201d is written from the perspective of a circus animal seething with anger over mistreatment; the character threatens mayhem should escape ever occur. But like George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984,\u201d the song also functions as an allegory for anyone oppressed by government tactics, the patriarchy or any other suppressive forces. The underlying bomb-fuse sound effects, metallic-coated vocal processing and martial-sounding drums further contribute to the song\u2019s uneasy, apocalyptic feel.\n\n8. \u201cI Took Your Name\u201d\n\n\u201cI Took Your Name\u201d is a sonic and lyrical cousin to \u201cCrush with Eyeliner\u201d; the tune deals with chameleonic personalities and the subsequent havoc wreaked by those who shape-shift with nefarious intentions. Choppy guitar riffs, menacing vocals and spates of falsetto harmonies only encourage this tension.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The subversive and shape-shifting 1994 album topped the charts but was never necessarily beloved.
