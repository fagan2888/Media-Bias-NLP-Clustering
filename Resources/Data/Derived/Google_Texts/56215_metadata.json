That bit circled in red reads, \u201cHow to date Japanese women who haven\u2019t been exposed to radiation.\u201d\n\nAn inflammatory headline, to say the least, and one that Korean readers were quick to point out as inappropriate given the sensitive nature of Japan\u2019s continuing recovery after the 2011 tsunami and Fukushima disaster.\n\nJapan\u2018s media caught wind of the controversy this week, and the rest is viral history.\n\nThe original article on Japan Today has been removed, but we\u2019ve captured the cached versionfor you.\n\nMaxim Korea\u2019s editor-in-chief said the article, in the February issue of the magazine, was about how to get a Japanese girlfriend, regardless of her exposure to radiation, and he apologized (sort of) for preying on readers with an egregiously provocative headline.\n\nHere\u2019s what he said:\n\n\u201cI would like to apologize for causing discomfort and inflicting harm on a large number of Japanese people as a result of the text on the February issue. I am reflecting on this incident in my heart and would like to apologize to anyone who was deeply offended.\u201d\n\nBut he didn\u2019t stop there. No, he didn\u2019t stop there.\n\n\u201cThe recent brash remarks coming from Japan concerning Dokdo/Takeshima and the island dispute (the International Court of Justice case), Prime Minister Abe\u2019s visit to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, and the issue of comfort women, have unintentionally caused us to make a mistake.\u201d \u201cI will apologize for a second time to the many Japanese who harbor amicable feelings towards South Korea and continue to wait for the correct resolution to Dokdo/Takeshima and other historical problems. I wish to thank the readers who reprimanded us out of love.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maxim Korea is under fire for a story titled \"How to date Japanese women who haven't been exposed to radiation\"", "title": "Worst headline of 2014?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Maxim Korea is under fire for a story titled \"How to date Japanese women who haven't been exposed to radiation\"", "title": "Worst headline of 2014?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/02/15/worst_headline_of_2014_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/123675_story__maxim-e1392422473463.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Maxim Korea is under fire for a story titled \"How to date Japanese women who haven't been exposed to radiation\"", "title": "Worst headline of 2014?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/123675_story__maxim-e1392422473463.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Emily Lodish", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Fukushima, GlobalPost, Japan, Maxim, Maxim Korea", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcde91\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Fukushima, GlobalPost, Japan, Maxim, Maxim Korea, Life NewsThis article originally appeared on GlobalPostWhat\u2019s wrong with this Maxim Korea cover?\nWhat is unusually wrong with this Maxim Korea cover?\nThe original article on Japan Today has been removed, but we\u2019ve captured the cached versionfor you.\nMaxim Korea\u2019s editor-in-chief said the article, in the February issue of the magazine, was about how to get a Japanese girlfriend, regardless of her exposure to radiation, and he apologized (sort of) for preying on readers with an egregiously provocative headline.\nThat bit circled in red reads, \u201cHow to date Japanese women who haven\u2019t been exposed to radiation.\u201dAn inflammatory headline, to say the least, and one that Korean readers were quick to point out as inappropriate given the sensitive nature of Japan\u2019s continuing recovery after the 2011 tsunami and Fukushima disaster."}
