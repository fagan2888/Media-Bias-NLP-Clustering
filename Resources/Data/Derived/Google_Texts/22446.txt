Officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) write about the complicated financial puzzle facing people with access both to Medicare and to public exchange qualified health plan (QHP) coverage in a new set of answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) .

CMS officials warn, however, that if John Smith were getting Medicare Part A for free, trading Medicare in for QHP coverage could lead to big, unexpected costs: People who are getting free Medicare Part A coverage, then trade in Medicare Part A coverage for individual QHP coverage, will have to drop any Social Security or railroad retirement benefits they're getting. They also will be responsible for "paying back all retirement benefits and costs incurred by the Medicare program," officials warn.

If consumers who have used QHP coverage in place of Medicare early in retirement later want Medicare coverage, they could face another trap: Having to pay Medicare late enrollment penalties. They will have guaranteed access to Medicare Part A and Part B coverage during the regular general enrollment period, but the enrollment delay could increase Medicare Part A premiums by 10 percent.
