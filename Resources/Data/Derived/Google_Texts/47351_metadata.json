There\u2019s even a cooler, a juice bar and a human-powered smoothie machine.\n\nAccess to fresh fruits and vegetables isn\u2019t just about lifestyle. It can have a big impact on health.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a strong correlation between diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and childhood obesity for communities that live in food deserts,\u201d said Roniece Weaver, a nutritionist and founding partner of Hebni Nutrition Consultants and developer of the mobile farmer's market called The Fresh Stop Bus. \u201cThese are all nutrition-related issues that are fixable.\u201d\n\nWeaver hopes the Fresh stop bus will help, by bringing fresh fruit and vegetables to some of the 90,000 Orange County residents who live in so-called food deserts.\n\nHere\u2019s how the USDA defines a food desert: A low-income community where one-third of residents live more than a mile from a grocery store.\n\nFresh Stop has routes through more than a dozen low-income Orlando neighborhoods such as Bithlo, Pine Hills and Parramore. Parramore resident Lashawnda Brown says she\u2019d use the bus. Weaver says she dreams of expanding the program statewide one day.\n\n\u201cI would. Anything to save a trip, either for walking too far, yes I would. I think that would be awesome, wonderful,\u201d Brown said.\n\nBrown feeds her three children and a total of 10 family members every day. Brown makes a weekly shopping trip on a city bus. But getting to the supermarket wasn\u2019t always this easy. The east-west bus line that runs to the grocery store only opened last April.\n\n\u201cWe would try to find transportation or pay someone to take us, but since they opened up that line, it\u2019s been wonderful,\u201d Brown said.\n\nAt the Fresh Stop kick off, local chef Sevarrest Allen demonstrates how to make a sesame Asian salad from scratch.\n\n\u201cWe have fresh edamame, fresh carrots, fresh red cabbage, some whole wheat pasta, and sesame dressing made with soy sauce, ginger, orange juice, sesame oil,\u201d Allen said.\n\nEating healthy doesn\u2019t have to be expensive, maybe $15 to $18, he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll probably feed 10 to 12. And you should have leftovers,\u201d he said.\n\nPamela Ellis attended the kickoff and said she lost 15 pounds after attending cooking classes like this one. She wanted to change her lifestyle after caring for her diabetic grandmother.\n\n\u201cI used to have to give her insulin shots,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cAnd I wanted to be healthy.\u201d\n\nThe bus is getting praise from Central Florida officials. But some say it\u2019s only a stop-gap.\n\n\u201cWe need to entice the big guys to come in and build smaller stores, perhaps,\u201d said Orange County Commissioner Pete Clark. \u201cAnd have fresh produce, and have fresh juice.\u201d\n\nBut getting big box stores to build in an impoverished neighborhood could be a tougher proposal than tricking out a city bus.\n\n-- Health News Florida reporter Abe Aboraya is part of WMFE in Orlando.
