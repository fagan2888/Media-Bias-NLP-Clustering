I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t say the same for you.\u201d\n\nJon Karl, ABC News\u2019 chief White House correspondent. (Fred Watkins/ABC)\n\nThe usually unflappable Carney has bristled early and often of late at Karl\u2019s frequently exasperated questions on various issues \u2014 the Affordable Care Act\u2019s inception, the government shutdown, federal-worker furloughs. On one occasion, Karl got under Carney\u2019s skin by interrupting him as he answered another reporter\u2019s question. \u201cHey, Jon, I\u2019m having a conversation here,\u201d Carney shot back. Noting that the discussion involved House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), Carney directed a barb at Karl: \u201cI\u2019m sure that you\u2019ll represent what the speaker is saying in a minute.\u201d\n\nWhen Karl pressed Carney on the suspension of military death benefits during the shutdown, Carney snapped before catching himself: \u201cIf you want to editorialize. . .\u201d\n\nCarney occasionally tangles with other reporters \u2014 among them, notably, Fox News\u2019 Ed Henry \u2014 but his exchanges with Karl have been especially testy, raising eyebrows among the White House media cadre and threatening to become a sideshow of the televised daily briefings.\n\nIs this just dramatic preening, staged for the C-SPAN viewing public? Or is there any larger import to these mini-clashes? Does rattling the White House\u2019s official spokesman shed any additional light on the workings of presidential power?\n\nSome of Karl\u2019s fellow press-room denizens view the give-and-take skeptically. Asks one: \u201cHow much of [this] is aimed at breaking news by getting Carney to crack under pressure, and how much of it is pure theater aimed at ratings, impressing bosses or otherwise gaining attention?\u201d\n\nIn an exchange of e-mails on the topic, Carney brushes off questions about his relationship with, and reaction to, Karl this way: \u201cAnswering tough questions is part of the job.\u201d He declined to respond to follow-up questions.\n\nKarl is more expansive. In an interview last week, he said there is a method to his approach. \u201cI believe we have to be willing to ask tough questions but also not always be willing to accept a non-answer,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the answer is not responsive, I think we have a duty to continue to push. I don\u2019t see it as going in there to be confrontational [but] as being pretty insistent about getting straight answers.\u201d\n\nAs for Carney\u2019s pushback, Karl said: \u201cI take none of it personally. We are in a pressure-filled environment where the stakes are high. Jay is a pro.\u201d\n\nAs professional combatants go, Carney, 48, and Karl, 45, are a well-matched pair. Karl is a respected, veteran Washington journalist (he spent eight years at CNN before joining ABC in 2003), as was Carney when he left his post as Time\u2019s Washington bureau chief to become Vice President Biden\u2019s communications director in late 2008. The two men are physically so similar \u2014 mild-looking, sandy-haired, bespectacled \u2014 that they could be related.\n\nIn fact, outside the office, Karl says he and Carney are good friends; their relationship dates to the Bill Clinton era. Carney\u2019s wife, Claire Shipman, is Karl\u2019s colleague at ABC News; she covered the White House before her husband joined it. Among other things, the two men share an interest in Russian history and politics.\n\n\u201cI have enormous respect for Jay,\u201d Karl said. \u201cI think, in some ways, he\u2019s one of the smartest people to hold that job. And I believe if he was sitting where I\u2019m sitting, he\u2019d be asking some of the same questions. I think he understands we have a job to do.\u201d\n\nOf course, being the toughest guy in the room can have its own payoff. ABC\u2019s Sam Donaldson became a household name for his televised run-ins with White House officials, including his trademark act of shouting provocative (though rarely answered) questions at President Ronald Reagan. David Gregory, who barely contained his skepticism and impatience with a series of President George W. Bush-era press secretaries while NBC\u2019s White House reporter, is now host of \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d And Karl\u2019s immediate predecessor at ABC, Jake Tapper, went from the White House beat to his own daily show on CNN, \u201cThe Lead.\u201d (Tapper calls Karl \u201ctenacious and tough, qualities not always in abundance in D.C.\u201d)\n\nOne of his network\u2019s most visible faces, Karl says he harbors no immediate ambition at ABC beyond the White House beat. He doesn\u2019t want for airtime, popping up often on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d the evening newscast and \u201cNightline.\u201d He\u2019s also George Stephanopoulos\u2019s substitute host on\u201cThis Week\u201d on Sundays, a role that helped vault Tapper onto his CNN show.\n\nLast May, Karl briefly found that he was the story after he reported that the White House had written 12 versions of its talking points about the terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, last year. The story was a solid scoop, except for one element: Karl initially reported that he had \u201creviewed\u201d internal e-mails sent by deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes that suggested the revisions were being made at the behest of the State Department.\n\nWhat Karl had obtained was a summary of the e-mail, apparently provided by Republican congressional sources seeking to discredit the administration. In a small irony, Tapper \u2014 Karl\u2019s former colleague \u2014 broke the news about the e-mail\u2019s contents, which made no mention of the State Department, contrary to Karl\u2019s bombshell.\n\nIt was a rare stumble for Karl, and he\u2019s chastened by it. \u201cI\u2019ll leave it at what I ended up saying at the time,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, one of those e-mails was not correct. As a reporter, you regret getting anything wrong.\u201d\n\nThe larger question about Karl, Carney and the daily White House briefings is whether the sessions produce much beyond the occasional telegenic confrontation. Ron Fournier, who was the veteran White House correspondent for the Associated Press, says the daily briefings are somewhat valuable as a conduit for actual news but that they have become \u201ca crutch\u201d for reporters \u2014 a substitute for more energetic and probing reporting.\n\nFournier, now a columnist for the National Journal, traces the decline of the briefings to 1995, when Mike McCurry, press secretary for President Bill Clinton, permitted C-SPAN to televise them live. \u201cIt made it more of a show and less of a place to get and give information,\u201d Fournier said. \u201cWe all know it\u2019s being televised, and we all end up puffing out our chests and acting a bit. It\u2019s human nature.\u201d\n\nAccording to statistics kept by Martha Joynt Kumar, a Towson University professor who studies the media and the White House, about two-thirds of every briefing is devoted to taking questions from reporters from the broadcast and cable news networks, the Associated Press and Reuters news services. The dominance of TV reporters during the briefings is no accident, she said: \u201cThe White House is most interested in TV and in getting their message out on television.\u201d\n\nThat might explain some part of the Jon-and-Jay follies, but Karl says that the public benefits from the daily ritual, too. \u201cReporters can complain that the briefings aren\u2019t very useful, but we would be the first to scream bloody murder if they went away,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a very useful hour of the day. I think it\u2019s important to understand what [the White House] is thinking, what their rationale is [and] what their response is to those who are criticizing them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The press secretary and the reporter battle it out in the briefing room, but does anyone come out on top?", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/paul.farhi", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The press secretary and the reporter battle it out in the briefing room, but does anyone come out on top?", "title": "White House\u2019s Jay Carney and ABC News\u2019 Jon Karl butt heads in press room", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/white-houses-jay-carney-and-abc-news-jon-karl-butt-heads-in-press-room/2013/12/22/16ab4f1c-69b1-11e3-8b5b-a77187b716a3_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/12/20/Style/Images/131030_DSC_8696_ful.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@farhip"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/white-houses-jay-carney-and-abc-news-jon-karl-butt-heads-in-press-room/2013/12/22/16ab4f1c-69b1-11e3-8b5b-a77187b716a3_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "jonathan karl, jay carney, abc news, meet the press, david gregory, sam donaldson, claire shipman, george stephanopolous, stylefront", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/paul.farhi"}, "news_keywords": "jonathan karl, jay carney, abc news, meet the press, david gregory, sam donaldson, claire shipman, george stephanopolous, stylefront", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "16ab4f1c-69b1-11e3-8b5b-a77187b716a3"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde733\"", "article_summary": "I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t say the same for you.\u201dJon Karl, ABC News\u2019 chief White House correspondent.\nIt doesn\u2019t take long, or take very much, for the Jon and Jay show to get rolling at the daily briefing \u2014 the ritual meet-the-media sessions in the White House press room.\nCarney\u2019s wife, Claire Shipman, is Karl\u2019s colleague at ABC News; she covered the White House before her husband joined it.\n\u201cYour mocking is entertaining,\u201d Karl replied, \u201cbut the president said you can apply within 25 minutes [and] that\u2019s not true.\u201dAs Karl continued to press, Carney slapped him down.\nAs a reporter, you regret getting anything wrong.\u201dThe larger question about Karl, Carney and the daily White House briefings is whether the sessions produce much beyond the occasional telegenic confrontation."}
