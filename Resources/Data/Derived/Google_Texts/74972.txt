With perhaps the most unpronounceable name ever, Republican head cheese Reince Priebus has vowed to the world that he's ready, willing and able to figuratively tattoo ObamaCare front and center on the grille assembly of every single Democrat running for office in 2014, as reported by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on Nov. 10, 2013.

Priebus, the current Chairman of the Republican National Committee, appeared on CNN's “State of the Union” and proclaimed that Barack Obama's signature legislation would become "toxic" to the nation's health care system both short and long term.

On the heels of the disastrous introduction of HealthCare.gov that's been described as just slightly worse than the sinking of the Titanic as well as the fiery ball humanity better known as The Hindenburg combined, the GOP's boss man finally talked the tough talk that many of the Republican faithful have been waiting years to hear:

We will tattoo it to their forehead in 2014. We will run on it, and they will lose because of it.

But at least The Hindenburg Made it Across the Atlantic Safely...

In the meantime, Priebus' Democratic counterpart, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL) downplayed the epic failure the roll out of ObamaCare was by trivializing those who have lost their current coverage.

As Rebecca Ballhaus of the WSJ penned of her Wasserman Schultz's defense of ObamaCare on CNN:

She added that less than 5% of Americans in the individual market will be required to change their plans under the law and said that their new plans will provide better coverage.

What the Florida Democrat failed to mention was that the 5 percent cited is 15 million American citizens.
