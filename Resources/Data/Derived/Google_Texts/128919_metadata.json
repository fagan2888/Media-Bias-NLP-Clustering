According to Deravi, Alabama\u2019s fund could generate $1.1 billion in economic impact and create 6,500 full-time jobs over the next 10 years by creating a permanent funding stream for the AHTF, which was established in 2012 but remains unfunded.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a sizable economic impact,\u201d says Deravi, an economics professor and special assistant to the chancellor at Auburn University Montgomery. He uses the word \u201cleverage\u201d repeatedly in describing the way a fully funded AHFT can work, bringing together resources from government, business and the nonprofit sector to expand economic opportunity across Alabama \u2014 especially for those with the greatest need.\n\n\u201cThe lack of affordable housing has been one of the most persistent economic and social problems Alabama has had throughout its history,\u201d Deravi says. \u201cIf you approach it as a partnership between the private sector and public and nonprofit entities \u2014 where you have that level of cooperation, you can leverage something that is sustainable. Add to that the social benefits of having affordable housing for as many people as possible, and the economic impact can be huge.\u201d\n\nThese and other findings are part of a report Deravi produced for the Low Income Housing Coalition of Alabama, which has been the lead advocate for the AHTF. The report was released officially at a Monday, Feb. 23, news conference in Montgomery. Scheduled to appear at the news conference alongside LIHCA officials and Deravi was state Rep. Patricia Todd, of Birmingham.\n\nTodd is sponsoring a bill that, if enacted during the legislative session that begins on March 3, will raise the Mortgage Record Tax \u2014 the one-time fee the state charges to cover the cost of documenting each mortgage loan transaction that takes place in Alabama. She says the abundance of similar funding models that are working across the country makes her optimistic about the bill\u2019s chances. Proceeds from the increase will be used to create a permanent funding stream for the Alabama Housing Trust Fund, with the funds to be administered by the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs.\n\n\u201cThe way things work in the legislature, if you want something funded you have to go and find the funding source yourself,\u201d Todd says of the efforts to get the Alabama trust up and running. \u201cNow, we\u2019re offering a funding source. We\u2019ve looked at other states that have robust housing trusts that are working at every level, and we want Alabama to have that same outcome. It\u2019s an opportunity, and we want to make it as broad as possible.\u201d\n\nUpon its enactment, the measure would increase the tax to 30 cents per $100,000 of indebtedness incurred by the property owner on completion of a given transaction. For example, the recording fee on a mortgage of $140,000 \u2014 roughly the median home value in Jefferson County \u2014 would be $210, up from the current $105.\n\nThe increased revenue would total an additional $45.7 million in annual revenue (based on revenue collected from the existing mortgage record tax during fiscal 2014), doubling the state\u2019s total revenue from the tax to about $91.4 million. Of that total, approximately $22.8 million would be designated for the AHTF, with the rest to be divided between Alabama\u2019s 67 county governments and the state\u2019s General Fund budget, according to a formula that is still being finalized for inclusion in the bill Todd will introduce. It is also expected that a small portion of the total revenue \u2014 perhaps 5 percent \u2014 would be set aside for county probate courts, where completed transactions are recorded.\n\nAs of now \u2014 a week before the legislative session opens \u2014 Todd says the funding bill is \u201cgetting good support\u201d on both sides of the aisle in the Republican-dominated legislature. With LIHCA and other housing advocates across the state, she has worked on building support from a diverse group of interests that includes business groups, bankers and real estate developers, in addition to elected officials, community groups, nonprofit service providers and low-income individuals.\n\n\u201cPutting the Housing Trust Fund to work will help reduce poverty in Alabama,\u201d Todd says. \u201cIt will open up new opportunities for homeowners and renters. And beyond all of that, just that small increase in the mortgage record fee gives us millions more in the General Fund. I don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re a Republican or a Democrat, that makes it hard to argue against.\u201d\n\nLIHCA project manager Ashley Kerr acknowledges that the proposed \u201ctax\u201d increase doubles the current rate of $0.15 per $100,000 of indebtedness. But Kerr also is quick to point out that the current rate has not changed since 1935.\n\n\u201cIn terms of putting a substantial dent in a crisis we\u2019ve been facing in Alabama for many years, this will make that possible,\u201d Kerr says. \u201cIt helps kids, veterans and hard-working people stuck in low-wage jobs. It will be a tremendous help in disaster recovery. It\u2019s about time for Alabama to invest in itself and its people, and this is a good way to do it. It makes sense to have the revenue for affordable housing coming from property transactions.\u201d\n\nCreated by act of the Alabama Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Robert Bentley in 2012, the Alabama Housing Trust Fund is intended to provide a flexible funding source for a wide range of activities aimed at increasing the state\u2019s available stock of affordable housing. Establishing the AHTF made Alabama one of 47 states and the District of Columbia that have at least one housing trust fund. But the 2012 measure did not specify a funding source for the AHTF, making Alabama one of only six states \u2014 along with Arkansas, California, Idaho, Montana and Rhode Island \u2014 that have created trusts, but secured no funding source for them.\n\nWeld first reported on efforts to fund the AHTF last June, as part of the ongoing series of reports, \u201cPoverty in Birmingham.\u201d That article, citing figures provided by LIHCA, reported that Alabama has a current shortage of 90,000 affordable homes for low-income people. It also summarized the range of housing activities \u2014 including construction of new homes and rehabilitation of existing ones, as well as building independent adaptive homes for people with disabilities and permanent supportive homes for people with severe challenges \u2014 for which the AHTF will use its resources to help private lenders and contractors defray some of the financial risks involved with investing in affordable housing.\n\n\u201cConstruction is an economic multiplier,\u201d says Deravi. \u201cBy investing in construction projects that meet demonstrable community needs, the housing trust generates economic impact that is felt locally,\u201d in terms of both housing opportunities and job creation. In addition to the $1 billion-plus economic impact and 6,500 new jobs forecast in his study, Deravi estimates that more than 7,100 homes \u2014 including new and rehabilitated single-family and multifamily homes \u2014 will be built or rehabilitated over the same 10 years.\n\nJim Fenstermaker is a senior consultant with the Kimberly Richardson firm \u2014 the company assists organizations with the writing and management of grants \u2014 and a longtime advocate for a housing trust fund in Alabama. Fenstermaker has spent more than 30 years in economic and community development and urban planning, the vast majority of it in the public sector, including a lengthy tenure as community development director for the city of Birmingham. In a state where affordable housing has never been a priority, he says, the AHTF will aid the development of a more strategic approach that is an integral part of addressing poverty and other longstanding economic issues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to do the right thing and create jobs,\u201d Jim Fenstermaker says. \u201cThere are real, substantive spinoff benefits that will occur over time. It\u2019s not as if this puts us near the cutting edge of anything. Alabama is one of 47 states that have housing trust funds. But we can sure take advantage of the opportunity that it gives us to start doing things in the present that will have an impact for generations into the future.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Weld for Birmingham", "description": "New bill could secure revenue stream for housing trust fund, generate $1.1 billion economic impact.", "title": "Funding affordable housing", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3850, "identifier": "http://weldbham.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Clay4.jpg", "height": 3219}, "url": "http://weldbham.com/blog/2015/02/23/funding-affordable-housing-birmingham-alabama/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 199569796846147}, "template": "WeldBham 1.0", "article": {"section": "News & Views", "tag": "patricia todd", "published_time": "2015-02-24T05:28:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-24T05:28:10+00:00", "author": "http://weldbham.com/blog/author/mark-kelly/"}, "google-site-verification": "878969361de6ef4b", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Robert Bentley in 2012, the Alabama Housing Trust Fund is intended to provide a flexible funding source for a wide range of activities aimed at increasing the state\u2019s available stock of affordable housing.\n\u201cIt is morally correct, as well as economically efficient.\u201dThe \u201cit\u201d to which Deravi refers is the Alabama Housing Trust Fund.\n\u201cBy investing in construction projects that meet demonstrable community needs, the housing trust generates economic impact that is felt locally,\u201d in terms of both housing opportunities and job creation.\nNew bill could secure revenue stream for housing trust fund, generate $1.1 billion economic impact.\n\u201cPutting the Housing Trust Fund to work will help reduce poverty in Alabama,\u201d Todd says."}
