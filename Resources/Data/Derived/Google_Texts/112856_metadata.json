Scott Walker (R) spent \u201cnearly two years\u201d studying the Affordable Care Act, according to a live interview he gave to the Wall Street Journal in 2013, and what he discovered was that the central claim in a lawsuit seeking to convince the Supreme Court to gut Obamacare is wrong. Though Walker\u2019s statement was not made in reference to this lawsuit, his understanding of the law has special significance in light of a particular constitutional doctrine at issue in this case, and his reading of the Affordable Care Act directly contradicts that of the lawyers seeking to undermine the law.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act gives states a choice: they can either set up an exchange where consumers can buy subsidized insurance plans or they can elect to have the federal government set up this exchange for them. Consumers with income below a certain level qualify for tax credits to help them afford this insurance. A case called King v. Burwell, however, asks the justices to cut off these tax credits in states with federally-run exchanges \u2014 an effort that could potentially collapse the individual insurance markets in those states if it succeeds. The plaintiffs\u2019 premise in King is that Obamacare was never intended to offer credits to people in states with federally-run exchanges. Indeed, by reading one passage of the Affordable Care Act out of context, they claim that the law unambiguously states that only state-run exchanges are allowed to provide tax credits.\n\nBut that\u2019s not the conclusion Walker reached after spending a couple of years considering the question. Rather, in his interview with the Wall Street Journal, Walker explains that there is no practical difference whatsoever between state-run and federally-run exchanges:\n\nWALKER: When I looked \u2014 and I spent nearly two years looking at this . . . I visited [Washington DC], as a new governor in December in 2010. As part of that visit I met with Secretary Sebelius, the head of the federal department of HHS, and have spent the last two years with my team, my administration, my cabinet, working with the federal government trying to fully understand and comprehend what it meant to my state and other states. And it was clear! It\u2019s a SINO, \u201cstate in name only.\u201d This really isn\u2019t an exchange that the states run or even run in a partnership. The federal government determines what\u2019s going to be covered. How it\u2019s going to be covered. And the only distinction is whether or not a state can say that they\u2019re running it, put up a sign that says they are running it. But, in the end, there\u2019s no real substantive difference between a federal exchange, or a state exchange, or the in between, the hybrid, the partnership. And so I said, if I can\u2019t run it, if I don\u2019t have control over it, why would I take the responsibility of explaining to people something that I don\u2019t have any control over.\n\nWatch it:\n\nTo be sure, Walker emphasizes the fact that he elected not to have Wisconsin run its own health exchange because he felt that he would have insufficient control over how the exchange was operated. He goes on to assert his philosophic view that \u201cany time you have a chance [sic] between the state running something or the federal government running something, we\u2019re always much better off having the states run it.\u201d In the process, however, he refutes the central thrust of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument in King. Tax credits should not be denied to people in states like Wisconsin with federally-run exchanges because, in Walker\u2019s words, \u201cthere\u2019s no real substantive difference between a federal exchange[] or a state exchange.\u201d\n\nNor is this a conclusion that Walker reached without carefully reviewing the question. To the contrary, Walker lays out the breadth of his nearly two-year inquiry into the differences between federally-run and state-run exchanges. He met with the most senior Obama Administration official entrusted with health policy, and he had an entire team of advisers working to determine whether there were practical differences between the two types of exchanges. The answer, in his own words, is \u201cclear.\u201d There is no substantive difference between the two under Obamacare.\n\nWalker\u2019s discovery matters for two reasons. Under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, judges give an extraordinary degree of deference to a federal agency\u2019s reading of a statute. Unless the agency\u2019s reading of the law conflicts with \u201cthe unambiguously expressed intent of Congress,\u201d courts will defer to the agency\u2019s legal interpretation so long as it is \u201cbased on a permissible construction of the statute.\u201d In order to conclude that the King plaintiffs\u2019 reading of Obamacare is correct, one has to believe that a governor who is openly hostile towards the Affordable Care Act spent nearly two years studying the law along with a team of legal and policy advisers, and yet he somehow missed the fact that the law gave him the power to cut off one of the most important provisions of the law in his state. That hardly indicates that the plaintiffs\u2019 reading comports with \u201cthe unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Walker\u2019s statement raises serious constitutional doubts about the plaintiffs\u2019 reading of the law. The lawyers seeking to gut Obamacare argue that the tax credits are part of \u201ca variety of \u2018carrots\u2019 and \u2018sticks\u2019 to induce states to establish Exchanges voluntarily.\u201d Yet, when the federal government conditions the payment of federal money on states taking a particular action, such conditions are unconstitutional \u201cif a State is unaware of the conditions or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it.\u201d As the Supreme Court explained in 2006, the question of whether a state is able to ascertain whether federal money comes with strings attached must be evaluated \u201cfrom the perspective of a state official who is engaged in the process of deciding whether the State should accept . . . the obligations that go with those funds.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, here we have Scott Walker explaining that, after spending two years studying the Affordable Care Act, he was completely unaware that one of the alleged \u201ccarrots\u201d and \u201csticks\u201d described by the King plaintiffs exists.\n\nWalker\u2019s Wall Street Journal interview, in other words, devastates the legal case against Obamacare. It reveals that a man who was tremendously motivated to find flaws in the law\u2019s framework wasn\u2019t even able to spot the alleged flaw identified by the King plaintiffs, and it raises grave constitutional doubts about these plaintiffs\u2019 legal theory.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Wisconsin Gov.
