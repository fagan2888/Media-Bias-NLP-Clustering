The recently opened New Leaf Plaza is now home to RadioShack, Planet Fitness and new comer A-OK Supercenter.\n\nThe owner of A-OK, Bruce Harris, says that he bought the land the plaza sits on so he could redevelop the area. \"This area used to be the mecca of Wichita and the biggest shopping center in Wichita, for the last 20 years it has been almost dormant and nothing going on,\" Harris said, \"the east side has build up, lot of the west side, and now its time for the middle of Wichita to come back to life.\"\n\nHarris donated $5,000 to Kansas Children's Service League as part of his grand opening.\n\nFor people that live nearby, the shopping center fills a void that had them traveling across town for groceries. \"We live just up the street, so it is nice to have everything right her,\" said Kirsten Heck as she was going to the grand opening of A-OK just to check out the new business.\n\nMany years ago, Twin Lakes shopping center was place to be in Wichita, but development to the east and west of central Wichita over the years has taken its toll. With the new developments and redevelopments, the hope from Harris and nearby shoppers is that the area will continue to grow and bring in new business to Wichita.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "After years of falling into decay, the shopping center near 21st and Amidon is being redeveloped.", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "After years of falling into decay, the shopping center near 21st and Amidon is being redeveloped.", "title": "Business booming in revitalized shopping center", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Business-booming-in-revitalized-shopping-center-282035581.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/FAE/861/FAE861ECDD4B4750A3D1D19E1269139E", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/74C/558/74C558E1AE62428387EBACD382976273.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "After years of falling into decay, the shopping center near 21st and Amidon is being redeveloped.", "title": "Business booming in revitalized shopping center", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Business-booming-in-revitalized-shopping-center-282035581.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/NewLeafPlaza.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Business booming in revitalized shopping center", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Business booming in revitalized shopping"}, "article_summary": "For people that live nearby, the shopping center fills a void that had them traveling across town for groceries.\nThere is plenty of new business to be had at the many shopping centers near 21st and Amidon.\nMany years ago, Twin Lakes shopping center was place to be in Wichita, but development to the east and west of central Wichita over the years has taken its toll.\nWith the new developments and redevelopments, the hope from Harris and nearby shoppers is that the area will continue to grow and bring in new business to Wichita.\nThe owner of A-OK, Bruce Harris, says that he bought the land the plaza sits on so he could redevelop the area."}
