Pushed by semi-official Obamacare spinner Jonathan Gruber, this line most recently suffused a piece by John Harwood on the New York Times front page. The idea is basically that Obamacare is secretly (\u201cshhh!\u201d says Tim Noah) redistributive. Obama can\u2019t use the term lest he scare the right, says Harwood. And if youre going to be redistributive, well, there have to be losers :\n\n\u201c\u2019Americans want a fair and fixed insurance market,\u2019 said Jonathan Gruber, a health economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who advised Mr. Obama\u2019s team as it designed the law. \u2018You cannot have that without some redistribution away from a small number of people.'\u201d [E.A.]\n\nTranslation: So suck it up and stop bitching, Dems! You\u2019re for redistribution, right? Don\u2019t give in to Republicans who always attack it. Harwood: \u201c[T]he redistribution of wealth has always been a central feature of the law and lies at the heart of the insurance market disruptions driving political attacks this fall. \u2026\u201d Gruber claims opposition to this redistribution is just \u201ca convenient tool for Republican opponents who would fight the law anyway.\u201d\n\nA few points:\n\n1. People didn\u2019t know Obamacare was redistributive? Really? It raises half a trillion dollars in taxes, mostly from a progressive tax system, and spends it to provide one of society\u2019s most expensive services to people who don\u2019t have it largely because they can\u2019t pay for it\u2013and it\u2019s not redistributive? Voters aren\u2019t that stupid. Whether Obama said his plan was progressive or not, they knew it was.\n\n2. There\u2019s redistribution and there\u2019s redistribution.\n\na) You can redistribute from the richer to the poorer\u2013call that \u201credistribution of wealth\u201d\u2013or you can redistribute from younger and healthier (even if poor) to older and sicker (even if rich). Obamacare does both. Harwood conflates these two types of redistribution, as former Obama economist Austan Goolsbee noted immediately on Twitter. But it\u2019s the latter type of redistribution\u2013not, as Harwood claims, the \u201credistribution of wealth\u201d\u2013 that \u201clies at the heart of the insurance market disruptions\u201d (the cancellations and the sticker shock, plus the coming doc shock) that are \u201cdriving political attacks this fall.\u201d\n\nb) You can redistribute by raising money through taxes and using that money to pay benefits to poorer people or to everyone\u2013the traditional liberal Medicare/Social Security model\u2013or you can redistribute by charging some richer people more for a service than they\u2019d otherwise pay while subsidizing that service for other poorer people, which is the model of the Obamacare exchanges. These two approaches may look similar in the distribution tables but they\u2019re very different. The former disperses the burden widely through the tax system, and also subsumes it under a general obligation to pay taxes, so no aflluent taxpayer can be sure that any particular dollar is going to any particular program. The latter focuses the harm on a particular subset of individuals\u2013not all affluent people, it turns out, or all people over 400% of poverty, or even all people over 400% of poverty who pay for health insurance, but all people over 400% of poverty unlucky enough to be in the famous 3% who are trapped in the individual insurance market (typically because they don\u2019t have an employer).\n\nAgain, it\u2019s almost entirely the latter, gratuitously narrow type of redistribution that\u2019s provoking anger about Obamacare. Where\u2019s the rage over the redistribution inherent in the old Social Security and Medicare programs, or the newer Earned Income Tax Credit? There isn\u2019t any. (In fact many of the same Tea Partiers who oppose Obamacare vigorously defend Medicare. \u201cHands off,\u201d etc\u201d.)\n\n3. It\u2019s BS for Gruber to suggest that the current \u201csmall number\u201d of losers is inevitable in any attempt to \u201cfix\u201d the insurance market. Obama could have constructed a reform along Medicare lines, with a large number of Americans who lost a little by virtue of paying higher taxes. Transiton to that system would have been relatively easy, as Comrade Bob Kuttner points out. For example, what if Obama had lowered the Medicare eligibility age by, say, 10 years every 5 years? Simple. Gradual. No fuss, no muss. The main people being visibly affected would be each succeeding wave of winners. Instead Obama (and Gruber) created his \u201csmall\u201d number of big losers\u2013a seemingly arbitrary group (since they are only those affluent people who happen to be in the individual market). And, again, it\u2019s anger at that arbitrariness and unfairness Obamacare objectors are mainly expressing, not a general aversion to helping the poor.\n\nEven within Obamacare\u2019s exchange-based structure, Democrats didn\u2019t have to create these losers. Why couldn\u2019t they have subsidized everyone who bought in the individual market, so today\u2019s \u201closers\u201d would not lose at all (they\u2019d be about as well off as before), while today\u2019s \u201cwinners\u201d would be even bigger winners? Then we wouldn\u2019t be trying to figure out if there were more winners than losers on the exchanges. They\u2019d be all winners! Sure it would cost more tax money, probably a lot more\u2013but the problem Gruber identifies as unavoidable (the \u201csmall number\u201d of losers) would be avoided.\n\nIt would be more accurate to say Democrats chose to make a \u201csmall number\u201d of conspicuous losers because they didn\u2019t want to raise more taxes and spend more subsidies in a way that would show up on budget tables. The Dems may have had a political reason for making that choice\u2013avoiding GOP objections\u2013 but it was a choice, not an inevitability. And increasingly it looks like a questionable choice. If you wanted to hold down the budget number, why not make it possible to subsidize more \u201cwinners\u201d by keeping the package of \u201cessential benefits\u201d from bloating to include drug and mental health services and pediatric dental care?\n\nGruber and Harwood defend Obamacare by appealing to an old Democratic cause (redistribution) and an old conservative axiom (there\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch). Both are widely shared by journalists.
