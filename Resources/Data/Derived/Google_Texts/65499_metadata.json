Critics say those efforts have routinely included illicit uses of federal funds.\n\nThe latest alleged violations occurred at the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS). The agency\u2019s Social Innovation Fund, created by the 2009 Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, has granted millions to nonprofits around the country.\n\nAmong grant recipients is the Missouri Foundation for Health (MFH), a large nonprofit \u201cdedicated to improving the health of the uninsured and underserved\u201d in the Show-Me State.\n\nMFH received nearly $3 million from 2010 to 2012 for its Social Innovation Missouri program, which was created to administer CNCS funds, and helped built coalitions to enact additional restrictions on tobacco use in the state.\n\nIt has been a powerful force in that effort, its allies say.\n\n\u201cThe Missouri Foundation for Health was seen as a leader in the tobacco prevention and cessation initiative, education, and working with smoke free coalitions,\u201d wrote the Healthcare Foundation of Greater Kansas City in 2012.\n\nThe foundation\u2019s and its allies\u2019 work produced tangible results. Missouri still does not have a state-wide indoor smoking ban, but a number of municipalities have instituted such bans since MFH received its federal grant.\n\nWhile MFH was also aiming for statewide policy changes, legislative victories in general are major benchmarks of the success of its Social Innovation Missouri (SIM) program.\n\n\u201cMeasurable outcomes of SIM include \u2026 increased healthy policy changes in targeted communities,\u201d according to MFH\u2019s page on the Social Innovation Fund website.\n\n\u201cThe intent [of Social Innovation Missouri] is to increase access and support, and encourage tobacco-free policy implementation and tobacco control by engaging the community and fostering policy change in the target population,\u201d the group wrote.\n\nMFH is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, meaning it can engage in lobbying activities. However, federal law prohibits lobbying organizations from receiving federal funds.\n\nMFH has not reported any lobbying expenditures in the past 10 years, but observers say other laws preclude the type of policy advocacy in which MFH and its subgrantees are engaged.\n\nMFH and all other Social Innovation Fund grantees were required to certify in writing \u201cthat no funds received from CNCS have been or will be paid, by or on behalf of the applicant, to any person or agent acting for the applicant, related to activity designed to influence the enactment of legislation, appropriations, administrative action, proposed or pending before the Congress or any State government, State legislature or local legislature or legislative body.\u201d\n\nThat language mirrors regulations at CNCS and guidance issued by the White House Office of Management and Budget on the use of federal grants for lobbying or advocacy work.\n\nOMB prohibits the use of such funds for \u201cany attempt to influence the introduction of Federal or State legislation; or the enactment or modification of any pending Federal or State legislation through communication with any member or employee of the Congress or State legislature.\u201d\n\nCNCS general counsel Frank Trinity reminded agency employees in 2007 that they and CNCS grantees \u201cmay not attempt to influence legislation\u2026if they are doing so while charging time to a Corporation-supported program\u2026or otherwise performing activities supported by the Corporation.\u201d\n\nDespite these prohibitions, MFH frequently promoted policy advocacy as integral to its Social Innovation Missouri program.\n\nA major goal of the program, according to an MFH solicitation for subgrantees, was \u201cmodifying policy language and assisting in navigating bureaucratic hurdles to policy change.\u201d\n\nSubgrantee applicants, the solicitation said, should propose strategies for \u201cadvocating for healthy policies so people are encouraged to make healthy choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cLasting policy changes also have a significant impact on tobacco use and obesity prevention, and are critical components of program,\u201d MFH wrote.\n\nThe solicitation was careful to note prohibitions on policy advocacy.\n\n\u201cThese funds cannot be used for lobbying activities,\u201d the solicitation noted. Other language in the solicitation suggested there may be some wiggle room on that prohibition: \u201cRules governing lobbying and advocacy are complex and subject to interpretation.\u201d\n\nThe Missouri Foundation for Health did not respond to requests for comment on allegations that it violated those restrictions.\n\nA key guide of MFH\u2019s activities was created by the group Americans for Nonsmokers\u2019 Rights, which MFH lists as a \u201ccollaborating partner.\u201d\n\nANR\u2019s 501(c)(4) activist arm calls itself \u201cthe leading national lobbying organization dedicated to nonsmokers\u2019 rights\u201d and says it \u201cpursues an action-oriented program of policy and legislation.\u201d\n\nMFH worked with its 501(c)(3) division, the Americans for Nonsmokers\u2019 Rights Foundation, contributing $270,000 to the group from 2010 through 2012, according to annual 990 filings.\n\nAs part of its support for Social Innovation Missouri, ANR and MFH collaborating partner Trailnet created a \u201ccoalition core competencies checklist\u201d laying out all the elements of a successful anti-tobacco coalition.\n\nThe checklist features an entire section devoted to \u201cpolicy advocacy.\u201d Subsections include \u201ccampaign planning and strategy,\u201d \u201cunderstanding of protocol and timing for approaching elected officials,\u201d \u201ccreating a policy implementation plan and supporting the policy implementation process,\u201d and \u201cpreparing decision-makers for opposition talking points and strategies\u2014neutralizing the opposition\u2019s impact.\u201d\n\nThe checklist also featured a single item on restrictions on federally funded policy advocacy: \u201cUnderstanding definition of \u2018lobbying\u2019 and how it relates to your campaign activities.\u201d\n\nMFH explicitly directed its subgrantees to push for the enactment of state and local laws restricting the sale or public use of tobacco products.\n\n\u201cSIM grantees and partners are expected to participate in local and statewide policy advocacy activities that affect their programming goals,\u201d MFH wrote in its solicitation.\n\nThose activities include \u201cpromoting program efforts to local media and policymakers.\u201d\n\nThe solicitation mentioned \u201ccommunity smoke-free policies\u201d and tax increases on tobacco sales as worthwhile legislative objectives for subgrantees.\n\nDan Epstein, executive director of the government watchdog group Cause of Action, said his group investigated similar allegations of federally funded lobbying efforts financed by Obamacare and the 2009 stimulus bill.\n\nCOA dug into Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) grants through its stimulus-funded Communities Putting Prevention to Work program.\n\nOstensibly a \u201cpreventative health\u201d project, CPPW \u201claundered money through so-called stealth lobbying coalitions, formed to skirt prohibitions on lobbying by non-profits, in order to promote local laws banning otherwise legal consumer products such as sodas, e-cigarettes, and fast food,\u201d COA wrote in a report on the program.\n\n\u201cWe already uncovered multiple organizations around the country that illegally lobbied with federal taxpayer dollars under the Communities Putting Prevention to Work program,\u201d Epstein wrote in an email.\n\n\u201cWe also know that entities in Missouri that received CPPW money have been offered federal funds by MFH efforts, so it is no surprise that the unchecked grant money going to MFH could now be used to violate the law again,\u201d he said.\n\nCDC, the report said, \u201cpermitted and even encouraged CPPW grantees to violate federal law and use CPPW funds to lobby state and local governments.\u201d\n\nRevelations about federal funding for anti-tobacco lobbying caught the attention of members of Congress and the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 inspector general.\n\nCDC literature on the CPPW program \u201cappear[s] to authorize, or even encourage, grantees to use grant funds for impermissible lobbying,\u201d wrote inspector general Daniel Levinson.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) wrote to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to express her concern that \u201cgrantees of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), under the direction of official CDC guidance, appear to have used federal funds in attempts to change state and local policies and laws.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn response to CDC guidance, several grantees as recently as 2010 have engaged in strategies that, absent an expressed authorization by Congress, appear to violate federal law regarding influencing state and local governments to adopt laws and policies,\u201d Collins wrote.\n\nIt is not clear whether CNCS was aware of or concerned about MFH grant language that seemed to encourage subgrantees to engage in policy advocacy. The agency did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMissouri political observers say MFH\u2019s work is just the most recent use of federal funds for anti-tobacco lobbying in the state.\n\n\u201cIn Missouri, many political subdivisions use tax money directly and indirectly to influence the outcome of legislation,\u201d said Carl Bearden, executive director of United for Missouri, a free market group in the state.\n\n\u201cA large majority of the time they are taking positions contrary to the best interest of taxpayers but not the entity itself.\u201d\n\nBearden said he was not familiar with MFH\u2019s work, but \u201cthe use of Social Innovation Fund dollars to support state and local laws against tobacco would certainly be an egregious use of those funds. A use that should be stopped immediately and those responsible be held accountable for it.\u201d\n\nSt. Joseph, Mo., is the latest battleground in the state\u2019s tobacco policy debates, and opponents of a proposed indoor smoking ban say they have seen impact of federally funded lobbying efforts in that city.\n\n\u201cOf special concern is the upcoming smoking ban election in St. Joseph,\u201d said Bill Hannegan, director of Keep St. Louis Free, a group that opposes smoking bans, of a proposed ballot initiative to ban smoking in indoor public establishments.\n\n\u201cThe illegal use of federal funds there could sway an otherwise close election,\u201d Hannegan said of the April 8 referendum.\n\nOne of the groups fighting for that referendum, Clean Air St. Joe, received funds from Social Innovation Missouri, a CASJ spokeswoman told the St. Joseph News-Press.\n\nCASJ is currently asking supporters to contact members of the St. Joseph city council \u201cto remind them only a comprehensive smoke-free ordinance that includes all bars, restaurants and indoor workplaces will protect the health of all workers.\u201d\n\nCASJ works closely with the Heartland Foundation, which is also a SIM subgrantee.\n\nPrevious attempts to expose and correct the use of federal funds for policy advocacy have been unsuccessful, said St. Joseph Telegraph editor Mike Bozarth, a former member of the city council.\n\n\u201cMoney and time provide obstacles,\u201d he said of efforts to stem the tide of federal lobbying money.\n\n\u201cI told local anti-ban folks they needed money and lawyers to sue over it,\u201d Bozarth said of previous efforts to institute smoking bans with federal assistance. \u201cI don\u2019t see how these violations are allowed to stand. But again, it takes money for lawyers to challenge them.\u201d\n\nEpstein said he does not expect the Obama administration to address these apparent violations without prodding.\n\n\u201cAs the IRS targeting scandal reveals, this administration is clearly more concerned about private money going to nonprofit organizations, which have not violated any laws, than organizations who push administration policies while violating federal law with taxpayer dollars,\u201d Epstein wrote.\n\n\u201cThe hypocrisy is blatant and taxpayers should demand accountability for these types of violations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Grant money supports efforts to enact anti-smoking laws in possible violation of federal law", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Funding provided by federal grants appear to have supported efforts to lobby state and local governments for greater restrictions on tobacco sales and usage in violation of restrictions on the use of", "title": "Federal Support for Anti-Tobacco Advocacy Raises Legal Questions", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/federal-support-for-anti-tobacco-advocacy-raises-legal-questions/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Sebelius-no-smoking-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Funding provided by federal grants appear to have supported efforts to lobby state and local governm", "creator": "@lachlan", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Sebelius-no-smoking-150x150.jpg", "title": "Federal Support for Anti-Tobacco Advocacy Raises Legal Questions", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd59c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe illegal use of federal funds there could sway an otherwise close election,\u201d Hannegan said of the April 8 referendum.\n\u201cMoney and time provide obstacles,\u201d he said of efforts to stem the tide of federal lobbying money.\nHowever, federal law prohibits lobbying organizations from receiving federal funds.\nCritics say those efforts have routinely included illicit uses of federal funds.\nMissouri political observers say MFH\u2019s work is just the most recent use of federal funds for anti-tobacco lobbying in the state."}
