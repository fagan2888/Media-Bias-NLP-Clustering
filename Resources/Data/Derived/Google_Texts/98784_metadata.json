Rand Paul (R-Ky.) handily nabbed the top spot in the presidential preference category.\n\nOn Saturday, the last day of the Conservative Political Action Conference, the results of more than 2,500 votes left Paul with a commanding 31 percent, followed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) with 11 percent and Ben Carson with 9 percent. Gov. Chris Christie (R-N.J.) came in at 8 percent and Gov. Scott Walker (R-Wisc.) and former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) tied with 7 percent.\n\nAnd with 42 percent of voters in the poll being students \u2014 and 46 of the voters being between the ages of 18-25 \u2014 the poll results aren\u2019t exactly unexpected.\n\nBut the libertarian theme was distinctly noticeable throughout the answers to CPAC\u2019s poll. A whopping 78 percent agreed with the statement \u201cMy most important goal is to promote individual freedom by reducing the size and scope of government and its intrusion into the lives of its citizens.\u201d And 78 percent opposed the \u201cNSA\u2019s use of data collection.\u201d\n\nPlus, 41 percent said marijuana should be legalized and another 21 percent said it should be legal for medicinal purposes.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the young people [who voted for legalization],\u201d pollster Tony Fabrizio jokingly noted during the announcement.\n\nA mere 12 percent of voters said, \u201cMy most important goal is to promote traditional values by protecting traditional marriage and protecting the life of the unborn.\u201d\n\nOnly 7 percent said, \u201cMy most important goal is to secure and guarantee American safety at home and abroad regardless of the cost or the size of government.\u201d\n\nPaul graciously acknowledged his win, thanking CPAC attendees.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to all the attendees who stood with me,\u201d the Kentucky Senator said after the results were announced in a statement released via RandPAC. \u201cThe fight for liberty continues, and we must continue to stand up and say: We\u2019re free and no one, no matter how well-intentioned, will take our freedoms from us. Together we will stand up for the Constitution. Together we will fight for what is right. Thank you and onwards to victory.\u201d\n\nPaul also tweeted out his thanks after the results of the poll were announced.\n\nTogether we'll stand up for the Constitution & fight for what's right.
