It\u2019s not just Cinco de Mayo. It\u2019s the moment of truth for Speaker Prieto, who has scheduled his Atlantic City bill for a vote today. But it\u2019s a less momentous day for Atlantic City, which remains in a bad situation regardless of whether Prieto\u2019s bill passes or fails.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: \"I look forward to Thursday\u2019s voting session.\u201d \u2014 Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto http://politi.co/1rwbIo8\n\nPOLLS OF THE DAY: Just 15 percent of New Jersey Republicans think Gov.

The Assembly meets Thursday with the aim of voting on Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto\u2019s Atlantic City rescue bill (A3614), a counter to state takeover legislation backed by Senate President Stephen Sweeney and Gov. Chris Christie. Christie has publicly challenged whether Prieto has the 41 votes to pass his bill, and even some allies concede the outcome looks less assured than when Prieto scheduled the session late last week. \u2018I have publicly said I support the speaker\u2019s position,\u2019 said Democratic Assemblyman John Wisniewski. \u2018That being said, it\u2019s unclear to me at this point whether there are enough votes to sustain the speaker\u2019s position, and if there are not, we then need to look at what a reasonable compromise between the two positions are.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/1NkeJls\n\nRATING AGENCY LIMBO: HOW LOW CAN AC GO? \u2014 \u201cS&P: Atlantic City default \u2018appears to be a virtual certainty,\u2019\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Ryan Hutchins: \u201cA Wall Street credit ratings agency has again downgraded Atlantic City, saying default or restructuring \u201cappears to be a virtual certainty\u201d for the seaside resort \u201ceven under the most optimistic circumstances.\u201d S&P Global Ratings has moved the municipal bond rating from \u201cCCC-\u201c to \u201cCC,\u201d and it gives it a negative outlook.

Only a few portraits of how rising seas will endanger American cities have entered the public consciousness. The most vivid example has been Miami. But Atlantic City\u2014with its severe financial problems and low-lying shoreline\u2014may prove to be another highly vulnerable place.\u201d http://bit.ly/1SYIXcR (headline via The Press of Atlantic City\u2019s Christian Hetrick: http://bit.ly/1SYIZRT)\n\nTHE SHERIDANS \u2014 \u201cDetective in Cooper Hospital CEO slaying case: Investigator threw evidence in garbage,\u201d by NJ 101.5\u2019s Sergio Bichao: \u201cA veteran detective involved in investigating the deaths of a prominent hospital executive and his wife now says the Somerset County Prosecutor\u2019s Office botched the probe by mishandling and destroying evidence. The explosive allegations threaten to cast new doubt on the office\u2019s conclusion that the 2014 case was a murder-suicide \u2026. For the first time, however, skeptics of the investigation are bolstered by someone from the Prosecutor\u2019s Office. \u2018It was common knowledge among detectives assigned to the Forensic Unit that the Sheridan evidence was improperly collected, improperly preserved and subsequently destroyed,\u2019 according to the text of a whistleblower lawsuit filed last month by Somerset County Prosecutor\u2019s Office Detective Jeffrey Scozzafava.\u201d http://bit.ly/1rwaNUK\n\nRIGHT IN TIME FOR THE BRIDGEGATE TRIAL \u2014 \u201cDonald Trump is the presumptive GOP nominee. Here are 5 people who could be his VP,\u201d by The Washington Post\u2019s Chris Cillizza: \u201c1. Chris Christie: \u2018I think Chris Christie is fantastic,\u2019 Trump said Tuesday night as the New Jersey governor (and his wife) stood just behind him onstage. No one has risked more with his support for Trump than Christie, who has been roundly mocked and dismissed by the GOP establishment for the decision. Personality-wise, Christie and Trump seem to be an obvious match. And Trump has said before that he would want a politician as his running mate. From a geographic/ideological standpoint, Christie doesn't add a ton to the Trump ticket. But who knows if Trump even cares?\u201d http://wapo.st/1SYJI5G\n\nTHIS ONE\u2019S FOR THE CAMPAIGN MEMORABILIA FREEGANS \u2014 Steve Lonegan, Ted Cruz\u2019s New Jersey campaign chairman, just threw out a ton of Cruz campaign buttons and stickers.

Via @Brian4NY http://bit.ly/1SYLfbM\n\nR.I.P. \u2014 \u201cPassaic County prosecutor\u2019s detective killed himself in home, authorities say,\u201d by The Record\u2019s Stephanie Dazio: \u201cBefore a Passaic County prosecutor\u2019s detective shot and killed himself in his home on Tuesday, many police officers and a SWAT team had amassed outside his home to try to talk him out of it, jolting neighbors and leaving them wondering what prompted the large response. Detective Sergio Mella, who had served in the prosecutor\u2019s office since 2007, was found dead inside the Grandview Avenue house after 6 p.m, Prosecutor Camelia Valdes said in a statement on Wednesday morning. He had shot himself with his service weapon, the statement said..\u201d http://bit.ly/1SYJCLa\n\nLIARS LIARS BUTTS ON FIRE \u2014 \u201cAre N.J. smokers lying when they apply for Obamacare?\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Kathleen O\u2019Brien: \u201cWhile 16 percent of New Jersey residents said in a federal health survey that they smoke, only 6 percent of the Obamacare applicants from here indicated they smoke. That mirrors the nationwide figure, according to Kaiser, which found that 17 percent of Americans smoke while only 7 percent of Obamacare applicants admitted to smoking. \u2018Given how low these numbers are, it's hard to believe there is not some misrepresentation or lying going on,\u2019 said Cameron Kaplan, assistant professor of health economics at the University of Tennessee, in the Kaiser analysis.\u201d http://bit.ly/1Nk2RQh\n\nTHANK YOU JERSEY CITY \u2014 \u201cN.J. home construction jumps to 10-year high,\u201d by The Record\u2019s Kathleen Lynn: \u201cHome construction in New Jersey is running 20 percent ahead of last year's pace, powered by the multifamily sector's recovery from the worst housing downturn in decades. New Jersey builders got permits for 6,448 housing units in the first quarter of this year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That was the strongest performance since the first quarter of 2006, when the housing market was booming. Last year, home builders started more than 31,000 units in the state, the highest number since 2006. \u2018The multifamily activity is predominantly Manhattan-centric,\u2019 said Patrick O'Keefe, an economist with CohnReznick, an accounting firm with offices in Roseland. Home construction in South Jersey, he added, \u2018is not robust at all.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/1Nk2MML\n\nTHE MARKET \u2014 \"Speculators, cash sales crowd out home buyers in some NJ towns,\u201d by NJ Spotlight\u2019s Joe Tyrrell: \u201cJust off Route 9 in Forked River, blocks of newly rehabilitated and elevated homes are interrupted by the occasional lot overgrown by weeds on which might sit a damaged or vacant home or a foundation naked since superstorm Sandy. Similar circumstances are visible on Passaic St. in Trenton, scarcely four blocks from the State Capitol, although the initial cause is different. There, the mix of homes includes some newly renovated, well-maintained, deteriorating or boarded-up, and a vacant lot. The city has been busy working on foreclosures. To real-estate analysts and academics, the circumstances reflect New Jersey's slow recovery from the big storm and the Great Recession. That has created problems for long-term residents, but buying opportunities for property investors, the experts said. The combination feeds into changing real-estate dynamics in much of the state, they said. One thing both towns have in common is the number of speculators purchasing properties in all-cash sales. This is worrisome given that speculators often use the properties to build rental housing or simply sit on.\u201d http://bit.ly/1rwaVUl\n\nLOCAL TIES \u2014 \u201cFulop-linked super PAC raised $360k in 2016, has some Jersey City ties,\u201d by The Hudson County VIew\u2019s John Heinis: \u201cIn the super PAC\u2019s first Federal Election Commission filing for 2016, made on April 15th \u2013 which covers the dates January 1, 2016 through March 31, 2016 \u2013 the entity reports raising a total of $359,600. A handful of Coalition for Progress donors this time around have ties to local government agencies in Jersey City. Fairview Insurance Agency Associates, Inc., of Verona, gave a donation of $10,000 to the cause on March 18th, 2016. Back in 2013, Fairview insurance came under fire when agency Director Ryan Graham got involved with the board via email as a vote for a Princeton insurance firm was imminent, via The Jersey Journal.\u201d http://bit.ly/1QSmppE\n\nISN\u2019T THAT PRIETO\u2019S TTF PLAN? \u2014 \u201cExtreme pogo competition comes to Jersey City Saturday,\u201d by The Jersey Journal\u2019s Alisha Morales-Lizardo: \u201cDon't look down Saturday at Riverview Park in Jersey City. You'll be sure to miss something. The park will be full of pogo riders looking to get maximum air in a relatively new sport that is catching fire with the \"X Games\" generation -- Xpogo. The Pogopalooza 2016 Tour event will feature athletes \u2018pogoing\u2019 nearly 7 feet in the air, contorting their bodies in all ways while holding on to their pogo sticks.\u201d http://bit.ly/1Nk2IMZ\n\nREMEMBER LANCE BEFORE HE WENT TO WASHINGTON? \u2014 \u201cLance endorses Trump for President,\u201d by PolitickerNJ\u2019s Max Pizarro: \u201c\u2018I have always supported the Republican nominee for President of the United States dating back to my first vote for Richard M. Nixon in 1972,\u2019 Lance said in a statement. \u2018While no one would confuse my personality with his, Donald Trump will have my enthusiastic support for President against Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/1QSmCsZ\n\nWE GOT RID OF COMMON CORE BY CHANGING THE NAME \u2014 \u201cState revises Common Core, renames N.J. academic standards,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Linh Tat: \u201cNearly a year after Gov. Chris Christie ordered a review of the Common Core standards \u2026, the state Board of Education on Wednesday approved amendments to them and also put a new label on all of New Jersey\u2019s education standards. The renaming of the New Jersey Core Curriculum Content Standards \u2014 under which the Common Core standards for English and math fell \u2014 as the \u2018New Jersey Student Learning Standards\u2019 has largely been viewed as a political move. Christie called for a review of the standards last May, during which time he said Common Core was \u2018simply not working.\u2019 The comment marked a departure from his previous support of those standards, and its timing \u2014 just weeks before the Republican governor officially announced he was running for president \u2014 left many speculating he wanted to distance the state from Common Core \u2026 [which] critics often equate \u2026 with federal overreach.\u201d http://politi.co/1SZuRI6\n\nSCHOOL BATHROOMS \u2014 \u201cNo Statewide Policy on Transgender School Bathroom Use,\u201d by NJTV\u2019s Erin Delmore: \u201cThe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 which covers the area south of New Jersey \u2014 ruled a students\u2019 gender identity is covered by the Constitution\u2019s Equal Protection Clause and by Title IX. The U.S. Department of Education made that clear two years ago. But what exactly school districts need to do to be in compliance with the law? That\u2019s up to the state. And New Jersey has no statewide guidance. Around half of the districts have adopted some version of a policy, or are in the process. The rest are working with a piecemeal \u2014 and often inconsistent \u2014 interpretation of the law.\u201d http://bit.ly/1rwb8qk\n\nOF COURSE HE\u2019S FROM NEW JERSEY \u2014 \u201cToo slow! Howell native trolls Cruz at Indiana campaign stop,\u201d by The Asbury Park Press\u2019 Mike Davis: \u201cWearing a red, white and blue flannel, one man stood out among the mob of supporters looking for an autograph or a selfie: With an iPhone in his left hand, 21-year-old Kevin Nichols reached in with his right for a handshake. \u2018Senator Cruz, can I at least shake your hand,\u2019 Nichols screamed over the crowd. Cruz gave him a sideways glance and immediately stuck his hand out. Before he could reach Nichols, the Howell native pulled his hand back and ran it through his hair. \u2018Too slow, Joe!,\u2019 he yelled \u2026 Video of Nichols's encounter \u2013 some would just call it a stunt \u2013 went viral on both his own Facebook page, political blogs and was aired on \u2018The Daily Show with Trevor Noah.\u2019\u201d http://on.app.com/1QSmcCR\n\nTHEY SHOULD\u2019VE GONE TO TRUMP UNIVERSITY \u2014 \u201cStudents facing deportation decry feds' fake college sting,\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Tim Darragh: \u201cIn April, prosecutors took the cover off their ruse of more than two years, announcing that 21 individuals had been charged with conspiracy to commit visa fraud, conspiracy to harbor aliens for profit and other charges. Meanwhile, immigration officials moved to revoke the visas of 1,076 individuals who had paid thousands of dollars each to recruiters or directly to the university to enroll. But not all of those who signed up for the school, mostly Indian and Chinese aliens, say they were here to \u2018study\"\u2019under false pretenses. Indeed, some say it was the federal government, and not brokers or recruiters, who victimized them. \u2018We were misunderstood, misled and hurt in the UNNJ process and subsequent federal sting operation,\u2019 some students wrote in an online post.\u201d http://bit.ly/1Nk2RzQ\n\nOPEN FOR BUSINESS \u2014 \u201cN.J. environmental agency has cut back on policing polluters, group says,\u201d by The Record\u2019s James O\u2019Neill: \u201cthe state\u2019s environmental protection agency has vastly cut back its policing of industrial and other polluters in recent years, raising the likelihood that companies will be less compliant with environmental laws, according to a report issued Wednesday by an environmental group. The number of site inspections made by the state Department of Environmental Protection fell from more than 60,000 in the 2011 fiscal year to fewer than 12,000 in 2014, a drop of 80 percent, according to the New Jersey Sierra Club, which used data posted on the DEP website and records it received through an open records request. The environmental group\u2019s report also indicates that the number of enforcement actions by the DEP dropped by 56 percent between 2011 and 2014, to 8,107.\u201d http://bit.ly/26V46Mq\n\nTHANKS OBAMA \u2014 \u201c\u2018A furor on campus\u2019 ahead of Obama\u2019s visit to Rutgers,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Conor Skelding: \u201cRutgers University president Robert Barchi said Wednesday there has been a \u201cfuror on campus\u201d as the university prepares for President Obama, who will deliver the commencement address May 15. \u2018We literally found out about this two weeks ago, and my first invitation was in October of 2013. So, it does create a significant furor on campus about what you have to do,\u2019 Barchi said during an Assembly budget hearing in Trenton. \u2018There are a lot of things that have to get done.\u2019 Rutgers announced the president's visit on April 14, a week after its board approved Bill Moyers, the award-winning broadcast journalist, as speaker. \u2018It\u2019s going to generate a major expense for the university...,\u2019 Barchi said. \u2018...I doubt that they\u2019re going to reimburse Rutgers very much for the expenses.\u2019 http://politi.co/1OeFHpj\n\n\u2014\u201cRutgers rescinds tickets for premium seating for Obama commencement speech\u201d http://bit.ly/1Nk2EN4\n\n*IF JC IS STILL ABOVE WATER \u2014 \u201cWhole Foods opening Jersey City location in 2020,\u201d by The Jersey Journal\u2019s Terrence T.

Plans are for a 45,000-square-foot Whole Foods market on the site of Metropolis Towers, at Columbus Drive and Marin Boulevard.

A bystander's recording of part of the encounter showed an officer kneeling over White, who lay in the street. Authorities said White reached for an officer's holstered weapon, and in the video, another officer released a dog onto White. White's family saw his body five days later, on Easter. Officers told Pamela White he had had a heart attack. A death certificate from the medical examiner suggested he had been on PCP. Pamela White expected more findings to come out. Then a month passed. Then several more. Now, more than a year has gone by with almost no answers from authorities.\u2019 http://bit.ly/1rwawBl\n\nTHE BLOOM IS OFF THE FIELD \u2014 \u201cOfficials: Bloomfield 'racial profiling' report is 'flawed'\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Laura Herzog: \u201cA controversial report that officials said has become a \u2018blemish\u2019 on the town of Bloomfield was discussed and largely criticized by the mayor, police director, residents, and other officials on Tuesday evening. The recently released study \u2014 which was supposed to be representative of a larger national issue, was conducted by student researchers from the Seton Hall University School of Law Center for Policy and Research \u2014 called attention to an allegedly \u2018persistent and disproportionate representation of African Americans and Latinos in the courtroom\u2019 as compared to Bloomfield's demographics. No officials at Tuesday's meeting outright denied the possibility of racial profiling in Bloomfield, but they emphasized that the study had many \u2018flaws.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/1Nk2BRl\n\nA BIG EFFEN DEAL \u2014 \u201cLocal store drops 50 Cent over autism mockery,\u201d by The Asbury Park Press\u2019 Devin Loring: \u201cRapper 50 Cent was supposed to make an appearance at a local liquor store here \u2014 until the owners canceled the event after the rapper posted a video in which he mocked an autistic airport employee.
