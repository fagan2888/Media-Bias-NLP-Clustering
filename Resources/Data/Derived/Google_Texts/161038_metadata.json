Photo by Brooks Canaday.\n\nThe U.S. health\u00adcare system today is increas\u00adingly embracing tech\u00adnolo\u00adgies and inno\u00adva\u00adtions that value speed, effi\u00adciency, and cost reduc\u00adtion. North\u00adeastern Uni\u00adver\u00adsity soci\u00adol\u00ado\u00adgist Tim\u00adothy Hoff says it\u2019s being assumed that this trend is leading to a more patient-\u200b\u200bcentric system.\n\nBut it\u2019s not: according to Hoff, we\u2019re cre\u00adating a health\u00adcare system that is much more trans\u00adac\u00adtional and imper\u00adsonal, rather than one focused on max\u00adi\u00admizing rela\u00adtion\u00adship quality and values such as trust.\n\n\u201cYou could argue the system feels more dis\u00adcon\u00adnected and per\u00adson\u00adally alien\u00adating than ever before,\u201d says Hoff, an asso\u00adciate pro\u00adfessor of man\u00adage\u00adment and orga\u00adni\u00adza\u00adtional devel\u00adop\u00adment, health\u00adcare sys\u00adtems, and health policy, with joint appoint\u00adments in the D\u2019Amore-McKim School of Busi\u00adness and the School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs.\n\nHoff\u2019s research focuses pri\u00admarily on the human con\u00adnec\u00adtion in healthcare\u2014that is, the rela\u00adtion\u00adships and social bonds patients and health\u00adcare pro\u00adfes\u00adsionals build together. He is part of the North\u00adeastern Uni\u00adver\u00adsity Center for Health Policy and Health\u00adcare Research, which fos\u00adters inter\u00addis\u00adci\u00adpli\u00adnary research and edu\u00adca\u00adtion per\u00adtaining to health policy and health\u00adcare delivery.\n\nFrom vir\u00adtual care tech\u00adnolo\u00adgies to mobile health apps, health\u00adcare today looks much dif\u00adferent than it did 10 or even five years ago. And Hoff says these inno\u00adva\u00adtions aren\u2019t the problem\u2014it\u2019s that our health\u00adcare sys\u00adtems, both in the U.S. and else\u00adwhere around the globe, are relying too heavily on them, and not as much on building a strong provider-\u200b\u200bpatient rela\u00adtion\u00adship. He says this flies in the face of what he\u2019s learned from talking to patients and health\u00adcare pro\u00adfes\u00adsionals, both of whom value that rela\u00adtion\u00adship and become dis\u00adsat\u00adis\u00adfied when it falls short.\n\n\u201cTech\u00adnology such as elec\u00adtronic health records and mobile health apps can fur\u00adther the depths of an already solid provider-\u200b\u200bpatient bond, but it can\u2019t replace it,\u201d he says. \u201cOn its own, it deem\u00adpha\u00adsizes the value of human con\u00adtact and relationship-\u200b\u200bbuilding, both of which pro\u00adduce lots of ben\u00ade\u00adfi\u00adcial things for patient care.\u201d\n\nHoff recently pub\u00adlished a research article in Mil\u00adbank Quar\u00adterly, the world\u2019s leading health policy journal, for which he inter\u00adviewed health\u00adcare pro\u00adfes\u00adsionals deliv\u00adering patient-\u200b\u200bcentered med\u00adical home care to older adults and ana\u00adlyzed how these expe\u00adri\u00adences shaped the staff\u2019s thinking, learning, and future actions in imple\u00admenting such care. He found that there isn\u2019t a one-\u200b\u200bsize-\u200b\u200bfits-\u200b\u200ball approach to making med\u00adical home imple\u00admen\u00adta\u00adtion work and sug\u00adgested that assess\u00adments of and rewards for this type of care should include more recog\u00adni\u00adtion of the value of its social and rela\u00adtional com\u00adpo\u00adnents. The med\u00adical home model, he said, is a key inno\u00adva\u00adtion of U.S. health reform.\n\nThis work leads into Hoff\u2019s forth\u00adcoming study focused on exam\u00adining the changing nature of the patient-\u200b\u200bphysician rela\u00adtion\u00adship through a social psy\u00adcho\u00adlog\u00adical lens. For 18 months, he expects to inter\u00adview cur\u00adrent and retired doc\u00adtors, nurses, phar\u00adma\u00adcists, and edu\u00adca\u00adtors about their patient-\u200b\u200bcare expe\u00adri\u00adences, with ques\u00adtions focusing pri\u00admarily on aspects of the patient-\u200b\u200bprovider relationship.\n\nHe likens the study to an arche\u00ado\u00adlog\u00adical dig, hoping to cap\u00adture a base\u00adline of data about what the provider-\u200b\u200bpatient rela\u00adtion\u00adship used to be like, what it looks like now, and how it is evolving. The find\u00adings, he says, could inform both health\u00adcare policy and management.\n\nThis all comes as the U.S. rolls out the Obama administration\u2019s Afford\u00adable Care Act. Hoff says Amer\u00adi\u00adcans\u2019 greater access to health\u00adcare is a major step for\u00adward for the country, but he wor\u00adries that despite this law\u2019s best inten\u00adtions, it will pro\u00advide greater access to a system that in his view increas\u00adingly sees patients as wid\u00adgets and is under-\u200b\u200bresourced to pro\u00advide good long-\u200b\u200bterm, rela\u00adtional care.\n\nHow can the health\u00adcare system get back on the right track? In Hoff\u2019s opinion, \u201cIt\u2019s about first com\u00admit\u00adting to a set of goals focused on what we want the patient-\u200b\u200bprovider rela\u00adtion\u00adship to be. Once we do that, the tech\u00adnolo\u00adgies and inno\u00adva\u00adtions get built to serve those goals. But we haven\u2019t clar\u00adi\u00adfied these goals yet. For example, the phrase \u2018patient-\u200b\u200bcentric care\u2019 gets thrown around a lot, because it\u2019s assumed we all know what it means. But no one knows what it means. It\u2019s become a mar\u00adketing pitch insurers, hos\u00adpi\u00adtals, and prac\u00adtices use to get business.\u201d\n\nOth\u00ader\u00adwise, he warns, impor\u00adtant parts of the system such as pri\u00admary care will con\u00adtinue evolving into a highly unre\u00adwarding expe\u00adri\u00adence for everyone involved. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a health\u00adcare system in which elec\u00adtronic health records will be able to show that you\u2019ve had the same doctor for 15 years,\u201d he says, \u201cbut you\u2019ll prob\u00adably never see that doctor and when you do, he or she will have no idea who you are.\u201d\n\nHoff\u2019s work focuses largely on pri\u00admary care, though he sees sim\u00adilar trends occur\u00adring in the arena of spe\u00adcialty care. How\u00adever, he points to two areas where we can learn some\u00adthing valu\u00adable: end-\u200b\u200bof-\u200b\u200blife care, in which patients and care\u00adtakers often develop deeper rela\u00adtion\u00adships and trust within short periods of time, and pedi\u00adatric care, which he says can set a foun\u00adda\u00adtion to build con\u00adti\u00adnuity of care for a person\u2019s entire life.\n\nHoff also notes that patients are often iden\u00adti\u00adfied as \u201ccon\u00adsumers\u201d in dis\u00adcus\u00adsions of health\u00adcare eco\u00adnomics, pointing for example to New York Times colum\u00adnist Paul Krugman\u2019s 2011 op-\u200b\u200bed taking issue with this label. For his part, Hoff is focused less on the term itself and more on what it implies\u2014that industry has a larger say than health\u00adcare pro\u00adfes\u00adsionals in how to improve health\u00adcare in America.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t dis\u00adagree at all with calling patients \u2018con\u00adsumers,\u2019 as long as we under\u00adstand that they\u2019re not the same as people shop\u00adping for smart\u00adphones,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 428816560463583}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow"}, "article_summary": "He is part of the North\u00adeastern Uni\u00adver\u00adsity Center for Health Policy and Health\u00adcare Research, which fos\u00adters inter\u00addis\u00adci\u00adpli\u00adnary research and edu\u00adca\u00adtion per\u00adtaining to health policy and health\u00adcare delivery.\nThe U.S. health\u00adcare system today is increas\u00adingly embracing tech\u00adnolo\u00adgies and inno\u00adva\u00adtions that value speed, effi\u00adciency, and cost reduc\u00adtion.\nHow can the health\u00adcare system get back on the right track?\nThe find\u00adings, he says, could inform both health\u00adcare policy and management.\nFrom vir\u00adtual care tech\u00adnolo\u00adgies to mobile health apps, health\u00adcare today looks much dif\u00adferent than it did 10 or even five years ago."}
