Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, recently offered up a passionate rebuke of politicians who defend Planned Parenthood, explaining why he believes Christian voters must not support these individuals.\n\nIn fact, Rodriguez, author of the new book \u201dBe Light,\u201d called it \u201cmorally reprehensible\u201d for Bible-believers to stand behind candidates who openly defend the controversial women\u2019s health care organization.\n\n\u201cI want to speak to every single African American, Latino, and Ango Christ follower who believes in biblical orthodoxy \u2014 how can we justify supporting anything \u2014 be it Republican or Democrat \u2014 that in any way, form or shape defends Planned Parenthood?\u201d Rodriguez told The Church Boys podcast. \u201cHow can we justify supporting any political candidate that defends Planned Parenthood?\u201d\n\nAnd he wasn\u2019t done there. The preacher went on to call such a prospect \u201cmorally reprehensible,\u201d saying that it is a \u201ccontradiction to our commitment to Christ and scripture.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny Christian who would support a candidate who defends Planned Parenthood really needs to seek scripture,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou need to repent, because there\u2019s culpability in what takes place in this nation as it pertains to the abortion industry if you dare support a candidate who supports Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nListen to these comments below:\n\nRodriguez, who is known for routinely and passionately addressing social and political issues like immigration and the death penalty, explained that the pro-life position is incredibly important in his life and ministry.\n\n\u201cI am so pro-life that it permeates everything I do,\u201d he said.\n\nWith that in mind, Rodriguez also spoke out against the stances of candidates like Democratic presidential contender Bernie Sanders, who recently said that he supports no restrictions on abortion.\n\n\u201cI get scared when people say there should be no limits \u2014 you\u2019re kidding me,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cYou\u2019re about to kill a human being who\u2019s about to come out of the womb. I can\u2019t justify it. It makes absolutely no sense.\u201d\n\nIn an earlier portion of the interview, which was previously published to TheBlaze, Rodriguez candidly attributed Donald Trump\u2019s rise to become the presumptive GOP presidential nominee as a mass reaction to the cultural dynamic that has been at play over the past eight years \u2014 one that has been characterized by what he described as a \u201chesitant angst building up.\u201d\n\nListen to Rodriguez at the 57:00-minute mark below:\n\n\u201cThe consequence of the earthquake is Donald Trump,\u201d he said, noting that societal reverberations have resulted from frustration over big government, impediments to religious liberty and political correctness \u201con steroids.\u201d \u201dIt\u2019s an interesting thing, because it\u2019s Christian populism.\u201d\n\nRodriguez continued, further describing the cultural changes that have unfolded, \u201cIn a matter of 7 and a half years, America has been redefined culturally, morally \u2014 in so many ways even economically [with] this thing called Obamacare.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow the author of this story on Twitter and Facebook and check out his new book \u201cThe Armageddon Code: One Journalist\u2019s Quest for End-Times Answers\u201d:\n\nFollow @BillyHallowell", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The Rev.
