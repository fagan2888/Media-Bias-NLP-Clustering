They laid the plans in December: Withhold funding for the Department of Homeland Security and then, using the DHS budget as leverage, force President Barack Obama to reverse his immigration executive orders.\n\nWhat Republicans didn\u2019t plan on was having a battle among themselves instead of with the White House.\n\nThe House of Representatives passed a bill that would keep Homeland Security funded beyond the Feb. 27 deadline while also undoing all the president's immigration rulings, including giving legal status to so-called Dreamers. But, after three tries, Senate Democrats have held on to a filibuster and blocked the bill.\n\nNow the GOP can\u2019t seem to find or agree on an endgame. Conservatives remain determined to undo the immigration orders, period. But cutting off funding for the department tasked with protecting the U.S. from terrorism would be politically dicey at any time and particularly hard to defend at a moment when Islamic State group militants are willing to burn anti-ISIS coalition captives alive.\n\nIn truth, the debate over DHS funding is more about optics than anything operational. The department won\u2019t actually close its doors and go home to wait for Congress to pass a funding bill -- or for terrorists to strike. Most of its functions are considered essential: Employees will still have to report to work. But they will have to wait until Congress restores their funding to get their paychecks. It would take a long-term stalemate to start causing real problems in areas such as hiring and purchasing equipment.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nBoth chambers of Congress headed home Thursday without a resolution. And with a brief recess scheduled for the week of Presidents Day, Congress has only eight working days left before DHS funding runs out.\n\nAsked Thursday whether he knows what Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell might do, House Speaker John Boehner was straightforward. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, drawing laughter from the press. \u201cListen, he\u2019s got a tough job over there. I\u2019ve got a tough job over here. God bless him and good luck,\u201d Boehner said, drawing more laughter from the reporters. \u201cWhat else can you say?\u201d\n\nAnd as much as Republicans will insist the next few weeks that the \u201ctough job\u201d is standing up to Democrats, it\u2019s really about attempting to settle the intra-GOP dispute. A number of Republicans -- including Sens. John McCain, Dean Heller and Susan Collins -- appear willing to back away, to fund Homeland Security without tying it to immigration-reform rollbacks. But the party\u2019s right wing refuses to give in.\n\nIt\u2019s a near-repeat of the lead-up to the federal government shutdown in October 2013. House conservatives pushed for a fight with Obama by attaching a defunding of the Affordable Care Act to a spending bill, considered \u201cmust pass.\u201d But the groups pushing for the fight were never able to explain how they would win. And after the bill got bogged down in the Senate, they had no idea what to do next. A 17-day shutdown of the entire government ensued.\n\nThis time, Republicans control the Senate. But without 60 votes, it makes little difference.\n\nThe GOP is trying to make this mess look like the Democrats\u2019 fault, saying the Democrats oppose the bill because they don\u2019t want to fund DHS -- neglecting to mention the immigration factor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a bill that fully funds the Department of Homeland Security. In fact, it\u2019s an increase over last year\u2019s funding. It funds every portion of it,\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said when asked what Republicans do next. \u201cI think the American people are going to demand that the Democrats actually take up the bill.\u201d\n\nBut blaming the Democrats is going to be a hard sell. For all the speeches Republicans gave in 2013 calling it a Democratic shutdown, the public didn\u2019t buy it. Polls found voters overwhelmingly blamed the GOP.\n\nAnother factor at play is that since Republicans took control of the House, they have never managed to pass a spending bill that became law without the help of Democratic votes. If Boehner ultimately gives up the immigration attack and tries to pass a bill that simply funds DHS, he would likely need almost every Democrat to vote for it. That would allow Democrats to claim to be the ones who broke the stalemate.\n\nThe whole episode is undermining the GOP leadership\u2019s goal of showing voters that the party can govern. Boehner and McConnell are left to juggle competing interests. Neither wants to see DHS shut down. And neither wants to see a revolt by their conservative members.\n\nAfter a back and forth exchange on the Senate floor Thursday morning with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, McConnell sounded near exhaustion. \u201cThere is a bipartisan desire to fund the Department of Homeland Security, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll figure this out sometime in the next few weeks,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nBut his -- and Boehner\u2019s -- bafflement hardly created an image of leadership. Boehner\u2019s weary shrug and lack of answers were ripe for a Democrat vine.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "house republican infighting, house gop party fighting, house republicans meltdown, house gop implode, house gop can't pass bills, republicans won't fund government, republicans can't fund government, republican congress fighting, border bill can't pass", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "\"I've got a tough job,\" a weary John Boehner says.
