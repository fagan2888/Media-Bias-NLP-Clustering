Practitioners inject the substance multiple times during each treatment session, at sites where tendons and ligaments attach to bones \u2014 areas considered to have poor blood supplies.\n\nIt used to be thought that chronic tendon injuries were caused by inflammation, an out-of-control response by the body attempting to heal itself. These injuries were commonly referred to as tendinitis, the suffix \u201citis\u201d meaning \u201cinflammation.\u201d\n\nProlotherapy touts inflammation as the cure, not the problem.\n\nCurrent understanding is that tendinitis is caused by repetitive motion. Biopsies of chronically sore tendons show a breakdown of the tissues and an absence of the repairing cells typically associated with inflammation. Today many doctors use the terms \u201ctendinosis\u201d \u2014 a nonspecific condition involving the tendon \u2014 or \u201ctendinopathy\u201d \u2014 a disease or disorder involving the tendon \u2014 to describe this process instead of \u201ctendinitis.\u201d\n\nAli Safayan uses prolotherapy at his primary-care practice in Washington.\n\n\u201cWe are using dextrose as a decoy,\u201d Safayan says. \u201cIn an effort to get the dextrose out of the area, the body floods the area with serum, which has a number of healing factors and materials that are necessary for tissue repair. Essentially, we trick the body into using healing factors already present in serum in higher concentrations.\u201d\n\nEvidence suggests prolotherapy may be effective for some parts of the body and not effective for others. Limited but encouraging evidence exists in support of prolotherapy for treating chronic tendon and ligament injuries caused by overuse.\n\nA small study published in the Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine demonstrated decreased pain and increased strength in patients who received prolotherapy for lateral epicondylosis, commonly known as tennis elbow. Other small studies have also shown promising results for treating chronic injuries in the Achilles tendon, the foot and the hip, as well as arthritis in the knee and finger.\n\nEvidence for treating low back pain with prolotherapy is inconclusive. In 2010, a Cochrane review article, considered the gold standard of medical evidence, looked at the combined results of five studies and did not find sufficient evidence that prolotherapy alone is an effective treatment for chronic low back pain.\n\nAn overall theme in prolotherapy research is the lack of good evidence demonstrating its efficacy as only a few high-quality studies have been conducted. More research needs to be done before its effectiveness can be proved or disproved.\n\nSome physicians are skeptical, including Steven Novella, an assistant professor of neurology at the Yale School of Medicine and the founder of the website Science-Based Medicine.\n\n\u201cIt seems that the practice and promotion of prolotherapy greatly exceeds what is justified by this preliminary research,\u201d he says. \u201cI would recommend caution to anyone considering this therapy, and certainly I would not believe the hype.\u201d\n\nProlotherapy is a low-risk procedure that can be performed only by a physician. You may experience soreness and bruising in the injected area, but it generally resolves within 24 to 48 hours. Infection and bleeding are possible complications, but very rare. All patients have some mild discomfort during the procedure.\n\n\u2013 Corey Carson, senior resident at the Georgetown University/Providence Hospital Family Medicine Residency, for The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2013/04/hftip23-e1422364037575.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfff9\"", "article_summary": "Limited but encouraging evidence exists in support of prolotherapy for treating chronic tendon and ligament injuries caused by overuse.\nQ: Is prolotherapy effective for joint or back pain?\nA: Prolotherapy is the injection of a nonactive substance \u2014 most often dextrose, a form of sugar \u2014 into an injured tissue to stimulate inflammation and trigger the body\u2019s natural healing response.\nIt used to be thought that chronic tendon injuries were caused by inflammation, an out-of-control response by the body attempting to heal itself.\nEssentially, we trick the body into using healing factors already present in serum in higher concentrations.\u201dEvidence suggests prolotherapy may be effective for some parts of the body and not effective for others."}
