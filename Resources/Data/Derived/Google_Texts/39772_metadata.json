The book, out Sept. 9, picks up the show\u2019s history where it left off, follow-up with the inner workings of the show during the 2000s.\n\nThe excerpt reveals that cast members felt tense, but reenergized by the politics of the 2008 election cycle, and suggests that while the nation\u2019s political landscape changed \u201cSNL,\u201d the reverse might also be true. Read some of the highlights below, but head over to THR to read the whole thing.\n\n2007 was the era of peak Hillary Clinton \u201centitlement,\u201d according to executive producer Lorne Michaels, but her absence made room for Barack Obama:\n\nLorne Michaels, executive producer: We were contacted by, I think, Howard Wolfson from Hillary [Clinton\u2019s] campaign, and they wanted to do the first show of the season. [Barack] Obama was heating up, but they called first, so I said OK. You have to play by those rules. And then, the week of, they bailed. I went, \u201cReally? You called us, and we gave it to you.\u201d I think every now and then I get carried away and think we actually do have influence. And then, after that, we put Obama on the date when Hillary was supposed to be on. The sense of entitlement which was following her everywhere at that point peaked for me at the bailing.\n\nIt was also a revolutionary time for Amy Poehler:\n\nAmy Poehler, castmember: Playing Hillary and Sarah Palin was an indication of women taking center stage in politics in a way that I hadn\u2019t been able to experience in my time there. My first show was two weeks after 9/11 happened, and for the first three or four years of my time there, we could barely do anything political. Everyone and everything was so tender, and we had lost Will Ferrell as our [George W.] Bush. Everything was so bad; the news was so bad. There was a lot of pop-culture stuff, and getting to finally do really deep political parody at the end of my career there felt really satisfying.\n\n\u201cSNL\u2019s\u201d political comedy during that period likely influenced how America saw its notable politicians:\n\nHoratio Sanz, castmember: I always kind of felt bad when Will Ferrell did his Bush impression because he was such a good old boy that you really didn\u2019t think, \u201cOh, this evil little rich prick whose dad and his friends got him in office.\u201d You thought, \u201cOh, he\u2019s just a good old guy I\u2019d like to drink beer with.\u201d As funny as Will\u2019s impression was, the audience as a whole, the whole country, would probably see that as, \u201cOh, I like Bush. Because he\u2019s Will.\u201d You know, if Will hadn\u2019t done that impression, or at least made him likable, it may have tipped it the other way. I honestly think so. We made up for it. I think Tina\u2019s impression basically killed Sarah Palin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Plus: Hillary Clinton canceled an appearance she asked for, and how the \"Karl Rove of SNL\" is holding the show back VIDEO", "title": "Updated \u201cSNL\u201d oral history reveals President Obama rejected a sketch about racial profiling", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Plus: Hillary Clinton canceled an appearance she asked for, and how the \"Karl Rove of SNL\" is holding the show back VIDEO", "title": "Updated \u201cSNL\u201d oral history reveals President Obama rejected a sketch about racial profiling", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/20/updated_snl_oral_history_reveals_president_obama_rejected_a_sketch_about_racial_profiling/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/SNL_Obama-1280x730.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Plus: Hillary Clinton canceled an appearance she asked for, and how the \"Karl Rove of SNL\" is holding the show back VIDEO", "title": "Updated \u201cSNL\u201d oral history reveals President Obama rejected a sketch about racial profiling", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/SNL_Obama-1280x730.png", "creator": "@prachigu", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Prachi Gupta", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2008 election, Amy Poehler, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Lorne Michaels, oral histories, Racial profiling, Sarah Palin, SNL, Tina Fey, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc624\"", "article_summary": "I think Tina\u2019s impression basically killed Sarah Palin.\n[Barack] Obama was heating up, but they called first, so I said OK.
