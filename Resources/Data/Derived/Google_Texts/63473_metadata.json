But that isn't the end of the GOP's long battle to replace Obamacare with a healthcare reform bill that won't drive up insurance premiums and bankrupt our country.\n\nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan promised to take the fight to the next step. While neither chamber had the votes to override Obama's veto, he said the House would hold a vote to override anyway, \"taking this process all the way to the end under the Constitution.\"\n\n\"If there is one story that is being told here today,\" he said following the House passage of the repeal bill, \"it is this:\n\n\"The idea that Obamacare is the law of the land for a long time is a myth. We will see this law either collapse under its own weight, or we will see this law, in the next session of Congress\u2026 be repealed and signed and replaced, by a Republican president.\"\n\nFor Ryan and his new team of Republican leaders, this is the beginning of an election year process to show that the GOP has put their divisions behind them and is making the legislative process work.\n\nAnd that the only impediment to good government is a Democratic president who has vetoed the bill to complete construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and blocked pro- job tax cuts.\n\nAmong the GOP bills waiting in the wings is a sweeping overhaul of the tax code to cleanse it of costly loopholes and corporate welfare, plowing the savings into cutting the tax rates for businesses and individuals to boost economic growth, job creation and business investment.\n\nOther areas awaiting legislative action include welfare and entitlement reforms, and an alternative to Obamacare.\n\nWhat Ryan wants to do this year is return to \"regular order,\" passing all 12 appropriations bill one by one that allow floor votes on amendments sought by members of the House GOP conference.\n\n\"That's the whole purpose of having a bottom-up organic process in Congress, not a top-down leadership,\" Ryan said at a news conference last week.\n\n\"I'm decentralizing power of this place. And when you decentralize power, you have a group decide these things,\" he said.\n\nRyan and the rest of the GOP leadership do not expect Obama and the Democrats to embrace their proposals to cut taxes to spur economic growth. They rarely focus on the economy or jobs -- except in an occasional speech where Obama cherry picks good data, but ignores other gloomy statistics such as declining economic growth.\n\nBy and large the White House and the Democrats are ignoring the economy, and with good reason. Much of it is bleak.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that payroll employment rose by 292,000 in December.\n\nBut dig down into the fine print of its report, and the employment figures aren't so good.\n\n\"The number of unemployed persons, at 7.9 million, was essentially uncharged in December,\" the BLS said.\n\nBlack unemployment stood at 8.3 percent. For working age teenagers, it was over 16 percent. For Hispanics it was unchanged at 6.3 percent.\n\n\"The number of long-term unemployed (those jobless for 27 weeks or more) was essentially unchanged at 2.1 million,\" BLS said.\n\n\"And the number of persons employed part time for economic reasons (sometimes referred to as involuntary part-time workers) was little changed at 6.0 million.\"\n\nThese long-time victims of the Obama economy want full-time employment, but were working part-time \"because their hours had been cut back or they were unable to find a full-time job.\" the government said.\n\nThen there were another 2 million unfortunate people who were \"marginally attached to the labor force\" but were not counted as unemployed, even though they had looked for a job in recent months. The reason: they hadn't searched for a job in the last several weeks.\n\nAmong them, there were 663,000 discouraged workers who have stopped looking for a job because they believed there were none available for them.\n\nThe real shocker in the Obama economy lately has been the decline in manufacturing activity and inventories as businesses push to reduce their stockpile of unsold goods.\n\nEconomists said that this, among other weaknesses in the economy, signaled much weaker fourth quarter growth.\n\nThe economy's gross domestic product, the broadest measurement of the nation's economy, grew at an anemic 2 percent in the third quarter. And its getting weaker.\n\nThe Commerce Department said Friday that wholesale inventories, in both durable and nondurable goods, fell to 0.3 percent.\n\nIts report \"added to weak data on construction spending, export growth and manufacturing that have suggested GDP growth braked sharply in the final three months of 2015,\" Reuters reported.\n\nEstimates of fourth quarter GDP growth have ranged from 1.1 percent to as low as 0.4 percent.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed's GDP Now model is projecting GDP grew by an anemic 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter. In other words, the economy is barely breathing.\n\nEconomists at Barclays last week were also projecting GDP will come in at 0.7 percent, dealing a devastating blow to the administration's rosier outlook.\n\nOther forecasters are saying the economy isn't going to improve anytime soon, facing an even rockier year ahead, and giving the GOP another opportunity to strengthen their control of Congress and win back the White House.\n\nStay tuned.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans kept their 2014 promise to the voters who put them in control of Congress, passing legislation to repeal Obamacare.
