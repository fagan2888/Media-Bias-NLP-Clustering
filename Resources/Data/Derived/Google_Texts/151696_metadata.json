A team of British researchers have determined that the collision between an icy comet and a rocky planet can produce amino acids \u2013\u2013 the sophisticated carbon-based compounds that underpin life as we know it. The findings add to the the growing body of evidence indicating that Earth\u2019s biological diversity was kickstarted by a cataclysmic event.\n\nPublished in the journal Nature Geoscience, the research effort aligns with the common scientific notion that organic life began between 4.5 and 3.8 billion years ago, when Earth was still relatively young. During this era, the solar system was marked by an extremely violent and unstable cosmic climate, and its planets were constantly bombarded with debris, comets, and meteorites. This period, researchers say, may have been crucial to the initial formation of prebiotic compounds and, subsequently, rudimentary forms of life.\n\nCo-author Zita Martin of the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London said that her team's findings suggest that life may not be exclusive to Earth, as its catalytic processes can occur virtually anywhere in the universe.\n\n\"Our work shows that the basic building blocks of life can be assembled anywhere in the Solar System and perhaps beyond,\u201d Martins said in a press release. \u201cHowever, the catch is that these building blocks need the right conditions in order for life to flourish. Excitingly, our study widens the scope for where these important ingredients may be formed in the Solar System and adds another piece to the puzzle of how life on our planet took root.\"\n\nTo test their hypothesis, the scientists recreated the proposed comet impact by firing high-velocity projectiles into ice mixtures at 7.15 kilometers per second. The collision generated amino acids such as glycine and D- and L-alanine.\n\n\"This process demonstrates a very simple mechanism whereby we can go from a mix of simple molecules, such as water and carbon-dioxide ice, to a more complicated molecule, such as an amino acid,\u201d said co-author Mark Price of the University of Kent. \u201cThis is the first step towards life. The next step is to work out how to go from an amino acid to even more complex molecules such as proteins.\"\n\nThe findings suggest that while liquid water may be a prerequisite of sustained life, its frozen configuration could play an important part in life\u2019s initial formation. According to the researchers, this discovery underscores the importance of exploring Enceladus, Europa, and other icy moons believed to harbor life.\n\nSource: Martin, Z., Price, M., Goldman, M., Sephton, M., Burchell, M.
