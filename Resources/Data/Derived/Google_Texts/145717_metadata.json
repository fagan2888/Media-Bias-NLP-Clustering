Volunteers will pass out entry numbers at 3 a.m. on the first of the clinic. Entry is first come, first served. Hundreds of people started lining up early.\n\nThe goal for many is to get free medical treatment through RAM. Most can\u2019t afford health insurance even with President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care act.\n\n\u201cPlaces like this people need. People just can\u2019t go with these health problems and not be able to get them addressed,\u201d Karen Braswell of Morristown said.\n\nBraswell is uninsured and needs dental work done. She says Gov. Haslam\u2019s failed Insure Tennessee plan would have helped her out of the coverage gap. That\u2019s where RAM steps in to provide free medical, dental, and vision care.\n\n\u201cHealth care is a right wherever it is in the world, healthcare is a right. It\u2019s like the services of the police and the fire department,\u201d Stan Brock of Remote Area Medical said.\n\nBrock founded the organization and has been putting together the free clinics for years. He said a couple from Knox County, Kentucky were the first to arrive. They need dental and vision care.\n\n\u201cIf I was to have to pay $1500 to have some dental work and you don\u2019t got it, it means a whole lot,\u201d Howard Butler of Knox County, Kentucky, said.\n\nThe Butlers have never been to a RAM clinic before. They say without it, they would have to delay treatment they desperately need.\n\nThe gates at Chilhowee Park will open at midnight and tickets will be handed at 3 a.m. You\u2019ll need that to enter the clinic. Organizers expect to treat around one thousand people by the end of the weekend.\n\nPeople are encouraged to dress accordingly for the weather, bring regular medications and expect a long wait. Doors open on February 6 at 6 a.m. The event ends on February 7 at 2 p.m.\n\nMore online: Remote Area Medical", "article_metadata": {"description": "Remote Area Medical is hosting another free medical clinic in Knoxville for those in need.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id= 511297956", "og": {"site_name": "WATE 6 On Your Side", "description": "Remote Area Medical is hosting another free medical clinic in Knoxville for those in need.", "title": "Remote Area Medical holding Knoxville clinic", "url": "http://wate.com/2016/02/02/remote-area-medical-holding-knoxville-clinic/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://mgtvwate.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/ramd.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Remote Area Medical is hosting another free medical clinic in Knoxville for those in need.", "title": "Remote Area Medical holding Knoxville clinic", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwate.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/ramd.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@6News", "site": "6news", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Knoxville, TN News & Weather", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mediageneral.wate", "fb": {"pages": 112945508738113}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wate.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1d4ffc72e0fc147870ebace80df0a02a?s=16", "application-name": "WATE 6 On Your Side", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WATE6OnYourSide", "published_time": "2016-02-02T23:00:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-07T04:20:00+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "CV5oKVNQCepzG3ubMGxG21BH-llTVkuHAscpIom1HPI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde3e8\"", "article_summary": "KNOXVILLE (WATE) \u2013 Remote Area Medical is hosting another free medical clinic in Knoxville for those in need.\nIt\u2019s like the services of the police and the fire department,\u201d Stan Brock of Remote Area Medical said.\nThe event ends on February 7 at 2 p.m.More online: Remote Area Medical\nThat\u2019s where RAM steps in to provide free medical, dental, and vision care.\nThe Butlers have never been to a RAM clinic before."}
