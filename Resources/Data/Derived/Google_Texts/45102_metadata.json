If you hate President Barack Obama and yearn for some idealized vision of America, she\u2019ll blame all the world\u2019s ills on him and then reassure you that the straight-talking Mama Grizzly wrapped in an American flag is going to make everything OK.\n\nIf you\u2019re paranoid about the government, she\u2019ll be paranoid with you. If you think someone\u2019s coming for your guns, she\u2019ll confirm that unfounded fear.\n\nShe\u2019s the affirmation of your deepest concerns, a defender of American values and the comforting reminder that the problems you face aren\u2019t your fault, and that you\u2019re not alone.\n\nShe is, in other words, a charlatan of the highest order.\n\nAgna Hurst was at a Trump/Palin rally Wednesday in Oklahoma and told Bloomberg: \u201cWith Sarah Palin, I just can feel it, she speaks from her heart.\u201d\n\nRespectfully, no she doesn\u2019t, Ms. Hurst. She speaks from YOUR heart.\n\nShe wants to be what you want her to be, so you\u2019ll support her, and buy her books, and donate money to her super PAC, and ignore the fact that her family is hypocrisy come to life.\n\nSarah Palin Brandi Simons, AP Former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin speaks to a crowd as she introduces Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at a rally in Tulsa, Okla., on Jan 20, 2016.

(Brandi Simons, AP) (Brandi Simons, AP)\n\nShe is not sincere. She is not smart. And she is not a good person.\n\nHow else can you reconcile her decision at Wednesday\u2019s rally to take her son\u2019s recent arrest on domestic violence charges and blame it, effectively, on Obama. She cited her son\u2019s post-traumatic stress disorder from military service \u2014 no small matter, of course \u2014 and then implied that Obama\u2019s handling of America\u2019s veterans and the way they are cared for led her son to, according to a police report, punch his girlfriend in the face, kick her in the knee and threaten suicide with an AR-15 rifle.\n\nShe made no comment about the woman, who police say hid under a bed in the Palin home crying. She made no reference to the many soldiers who suffer PTSD and don\u2019t commit violent assaults. She made no reference to the fact that, despite this country\u2019s pitiful treatment of veterans and their mental health, she is a millionaire entertainer who could undoubtedly afford to get her son the best treatment available.\n\nPaul Rieckhoff, the head of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, told NBC News: \u201cIt's not President Obama's fault that Sarah Palin's son has PTSD. PTSD is a very serious problem, a complicated mental health injury and I would be extremely reluctant to blame any one person in particular.\u201d\n\nAnyone with half a brain and a modicum of decency would be reluctant to blame one person for such a problem. But Palin has no such decency. She took Trump\u2019s stage and used it to shift responsibility for her son\u2019s actions onto someone else, and to play into the everything-is-Obama\u2019s-fault narrative she knows her admirers want to hear.\n\nSo goes the party of personal responsibility.\n\nTrump is no better. His thousands-strong audiences are coming to his rallies and hearing their own fears and biases and suspicions projected back at them.\n\nThey\u2019ve spent years listening to politicians promise them legislative acts that were never remotely possible \u2014 repeal Obamacare, defund Planned Parenthood, ban gay marriage \u2014 and now they\u2019re rightfully angry. When you\u2019re angry, nothing feels better than having someone validate that anger and throw it right back at you five times louder and angrier.\n\nBut getting duped by one set of people only to be duped by another isn\u2019t progress. Palin and Trump do nothing but spout platitudes and make vague promises based on zero actual policy proposals.\n\nThey\u2019re a match made in reality television heaven, fabulists who feather their own nests by telling you the world\u2019s crumbling and they're the only ones who can patch it up.\n\nIt\u2019s like the old musical, \u201cThe Music Man.\u201d Con man Harold Hill rolls into River City, Iowa, and convinces the locals that they have trouble, selling them a solution that will never come.\n\nHill sings to the people: \u201cWell, either you're closing your eyes to a situation you do not wish to acknowledge, or you are not aware of the caliber of disaster indicated.\u201d\n\nThat pretty well sums you up if you\u2019re buying what Palin and Trump are selling.\n\nAll politicians are con artists, to one degree or another. But these two are the worst kind.\n\nThey shout the things people want to hear shouted and they accept responsibility for nothing, giving others permission to do the same.\n\nThey\u2019re blank screens. Empty souls. And terribly, terribly bad for the country they claim to love.\n\nrhuppke@tribpub.com", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Sarah Palin: Charlatan of the highest order", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune", "author": "Chicago Tribune", "og": {"site_name": "chicagotribune.com", "description": "Sarah Palin, like Donald Trump , the presidential candidate she endorsed this week, is a blank screen.", "title": "Sarah Palin: Charlatan of the highest order", "url": "http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-sarah-palin-ptsd-huppke-20160121-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56a11774/turbine/ct-sarah-palin-ptsd-huppke-20160121", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp08.18", "twitter": {"site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "sarah palin ptsd, palin trump, sarah palin obama ptsd, palin son arrest, donald trump, trump campaign", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid/85648480", "fb": {"page_id": 5953023255, "app_id": 306836229411287}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2016-01-21", "Description": "Sarah Palin's claim that her son's domestic violence arrest was Obama's fault is despicable", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "sarah palin ptsd, palin trump, sarah palin obama ptsd, palin son arrest, donald trump, trump campaign"}, "article_summary": "Sarah Palin Brandi Simons, AP Former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin speaks to a crowd as she introduces Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at a rally in Tulsa, Okla., on Jan 20, 2016.\nSarah Palin, like Donald Trump, the presidential candidate she endorsed this week, is a blank screen.\nFormer Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin speaks to a crowd as she introduces Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at a rally in Tulsa, Okla., on Jan 20, 2016.\nAgna Hurst was at a Trump/Palin rally Wednesday in Oklahoma and told Bloomberg: \u201cWith Sarah Palin, I just can feel it, she speaks from her heart.\u201dRespectfully, no she doesn\u2019t, Ms. Hurst.\nHow else can you reconcile her decision at Wednesday\u2019s rally to take her son\u2019s recent arrest on domestic violence charges and blame it, effectively, on Obama."}
