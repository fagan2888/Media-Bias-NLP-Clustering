Snow wants to see the country move to a single-payer system, essentially by expanding Medicare, the health system now available to the nation's senior citizens. She calls health care a human right.

Snow has set forth a plan to increase the minimum wage each January until it reaches $15.25 in 2021 and, after that, adjust it based on purchasing power. She said $12 per hour isn't enough for families to live on.

Snow said abortion should remain legal and that she would oppose efforts to restrict it.
