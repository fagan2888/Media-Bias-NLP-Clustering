Both increases, adjusted to eliminate the effects of product mix changes, were the sharpest in years. Relative to premiums, administrative expenses were 8.7%. They were 8.9% in 2012.\n\nInformation Systems, broker Commissions and Customer Services costs were central to the increases. The sharp rates of increase in these plus in Actuarial and Advertising expenses suggest the costs to adapt to the Affordable Care Act and the costs to communicate these changes with their customers.\n\nAdditional information was published yesterday in Plan Management Navigator, and is posted at http://www.sherlockco.com/docs/navigator/Blue July Navigator 2014.pdf.
