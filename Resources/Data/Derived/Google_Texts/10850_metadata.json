That emergency restriction was imposed in March.\n\nBut board members said he shouldn\u2019t be seeing any patients, male or female.\n\n\u201cThis is a bad actor, a real bad actor,\u201d said board chairman Dr. Zachariah P. Zachariah.\n\nThe board, which revoked the licenses of several doctors at its meeting in Orlando on Friday, could not take that step with Esmailzadeh because his attorney had reached a settlement with Department of Health prosecutors to resolve the cases.\n\nThe settlement included a reprimand, $20,000 fine, and some courses. The gender restriction on his license would remain until the physician could demonstrate that he could see women patients safely.\n\nThe strongest action the board could take in such a situation was to reject the settlement, which it did unanimously. Then members made a \u201ccounter-offer\u201d to settle the case with revocation, which Esmailzadeh\u2019s attorney said will be rejected. That would set the stage for a formal hearing with witnesses and evidence; the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation would then come back to the board for final action. All this takes months, often years.\n\nThe accusations against Esmailzadeh, who is certified in pain management by the American Board of Pain Medicine, involved four women, including three who came forward after the first one filed a complaint. Three of the women were his patients while he worked at The BACK Center in Melbourne in 2011. The fourth saw him in January 2013 at Advantacare in Daytona Beach, records show. They said that Esmailzadeh touched them sexually while he was examining or treating them; two of them were receiving injections in their back at the time.\n\nThe attorney for one of the patients who complained, Robert J. Ratiner of Miami, attended the Board of Medicine meeting to ask for strong action. Ratiner said Esmailzadeh continued to molest women even after he knew he was under investigation\n\n\u201cThat shows depravity,\u201d Ratiner said. \u201cBrazen depravity.\u201d\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
