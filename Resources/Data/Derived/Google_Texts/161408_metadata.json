He's likely to spend much of his 60 or so minutes, pressing his case about the success of his presidential tenure and the historical nature of his policy legacy.\n\nAs such, he's sure to repurpose his \"tick-list\" of foreign policy successes (Iran nuclear deal, Cuban reengagement, the Paris climate deal and the trans-Pacific trade agreement) that he raised in his December press conference. He's likely to tout some of the economic numbers (job growth and unemployment), which were finally strong enough to give the Federal Reserve the security it required to raise short term interest rates last month.\n\nHe's further likely to note the ways in which he has advanced progressive policy priorities on immigration reform and gun control by liberally using his \"pen\" to take executive action. He may also raise the big constitutional wins on marriage equality and the Affordable Care Act that he and his administration enjoyed last year in the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n[GALLERY: Barack Obama Cartoons]\n\nThese achievements are real. Obama has moved the ball forward on a number of fronts. Political scientists and historians who construct presidential legacies will surely make note of these and other achievements (e.g., women being allowed to serve in combat positions and members of the LGBT community being able to serve openly in the military).\n\nThe problem is that the list Obama judges himself on isn't the one the public cares about.\n\nAs Gallup has shown, many Americans are dissatisfied with the current direction of the country and fewer trust the federal government to protect them from terrorist attacks. Much of this is likely the result of Obama's foreign policy decisions on Libya, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, which have often seemed short-sighted and ill-timed. As Fred Kaplan recently noted in Slate, \"The problem with the president's list of foreign policy triumphs is that they're provisional, while the failures are all too tangible and threatening.\"\n\n\n\n[VIEW: 2015: The Year in Cartoons]", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Politics [News]", "title": "Obama's Legacy Will Be Contested for Decades", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The president will sell a rosy picture of his administration, but the public isn't buying it yet.", "title": "Obama's Contested Legacy", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/lara-brown/articles/2016-01-08/obamas-legacy-will-be-contested-for-decades", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/22/51/9a2993c74cf9bde503a9467bc139/151231-obama-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "The president will sell a rosy picture of his administration, but the public isn't buying it yet.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama's Legacy Will Be Contested for Decades"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Jan. 8, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Lara Brown,Obama administration,Obama, Barack,history,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion],Politics [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The president will sell a rosy picture of his administration, but the public isn't buying it yet."}, "article_summary": "Much of this is likely the result of Obama's foreign policy decisions on Libya, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, which have often seemed short-sighted and ill-timed.\nHe's likely to spend much of his 60 or so minutes, pressing his case about the success of his presidential tenure and the historical nature of his policy legacy.\nAs Fred Kaplan recently noted in Slate, \"The problem with the president's list of foreign policy triumphs is that they're provisional, while the failures are all too tangible and threatening.\"\nAs such, he's sure to repurpose his \"tick-list\" of foreign policy successes (Iran nuclear deal, Cuban reengagement, the Paris climate deal and the trans-Pacific trade agreement) that he raised in his December press conference.\nThe problem is that the list Obama judges himself on isn't the one the public cares about."}
