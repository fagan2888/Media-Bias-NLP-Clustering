She didn\u2019t worry much about her sore neck until a scan detected a broken bone.\n\nThe operation she needed, a spinal fusion, is done tens of thousands of times a year without incident. Stiles, 71, had a choice of three specially trained surgeons at Citrus Memorial in Inverness, which was rated among the top 100 nationally for spinal procedures.\n\nShe had no way of knowing how much was riding on her decision. The doctor she chose, Constantine Toumbis, had one of the highest rates of complications in the country for spinal fusions. The other two doctors had rates among the lowest for postoperative problems like infections and internal bleeding.\n\nIt\u2019s conventional wisdom that there are \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d hospitals \u2014 and that selecting a good one can protect patients from the kinds of medical errors that injure or kill hundreds of thousands of Americans each year.\n\nBut a ProPublica analysis of Medicare data found that, when it comes to elective operations, it is much more important to pick the right surgeon.\n\nToday, we are making public the complication rates of nearly 17,000 surgeons nationwide. Patients will be able to weigh surgeons\u2019 past performance as they make what can be a life-and-death decision. Doctors themselves can see where they stand relative to their peers.\n\nThe numbers show that the stark differences that Stiles confronted at Citrus Memorial are commonplace across America. Yet many hospitals don\u2019t track the complication rates of individual surgeons and use that data to force improvements. And neither does the government.\n\nA small share of doctors, 11 percent, accounted for about 25 percent of the complications. Hundreds of surgeons across the country had rates double and triple the national average. Every day, surgeons with the highest complication rates in our analysis are performing operations in hospitals nationwide.\n\nSubpar performers work even at academic medical centers considered among the nation\u2019s best.\n\nA surgeon with one of the nation\u2019s highest complication rates for prostate removals in our analysis operates at Baltimore\u2019s Johns Hopkins Hospital, a national powerhouse known for its research on patient safety. He alone had more complications than all 10 of his colleagues combined \u2014 though they performed nine times as many of the same procedures.\n\nBy contrast, some of the nation\u2019s best results for knee replacements were turned in by a surgeon at a small-town clinic in Alabama who insists on personally handling even the most menial aspects of each patient\u2019s surgery and follow-up care.\n\nProPublica compared the performance of surgeons by examining five years of Medicare records for eight common elective procedures, including knee and hip replacements, spinal fusions and prostate removals.\n\nTo be fair to surgeons, ProPublica\u2019s analysis accounted for factors such as patients\u2019 health and age. We focused only on elective cases because they typically involve healthier patients with the best odds of a smooth recovery.\n\nAs would be expected, overall complication rates were relatively low, ranging from 2 percent to 4 percent, depending on the type of surgery. But experts who reviewed ProPublica\u2019s results say they strongly suggest that the typical surgeon\u2019s rate can and should be significantly lower.\n\nThe evidence: Some 756 surgeons who each did at least 50 operations did not record a single complication in the five years covered by the analysis. Another 1,423 had only one.\n\nThe issue of patient safety has been at the forefront of American health care since 1999, when the Institute of Medicine released \u201cTo Err Is Human,\u201d a landmark report on the startling frequency of medical errors.\n\nBut since then, medical errors haven\u2019t abated \u2014 recent studies estimate that at least 200,000 patients a year die in hospitals from preventable errors and complications related to their care, which would make patient harm the nation\u2019s third-leading cause of death.\n\nSome say one answer is allowing patients to see surgeons\u2019 track records.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s long overdue,\u201d said Dr. Charles Mick, former president of the North American Spine Society, who reviewed ProPublica\u2019s findings. \u201cHopefully, it will be a step toward a culture where transparency and open discussion of mistakes, complications and errors will be the norm and not something that\u2019s hidden.\u201d\n\nMany systems are supposed to protect patients from high-risk doctors. But ProPublica\u2019s reporting shows that they often fail to identify problem performers.\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services collects reams of data from hospitals and publishes hospital-wide quality measures. It recently started reporting some data on physician groups that voluntarily provide the information. The agency has plans to eventually publish quality data for individual doctors but it hasn\u2019t done so.\n\nCMS officials say focusing on doctors alone isn\u2019t the answer because hospitals rely on teams of health professionals. Reducing patient harm \u201crequires a focus on the full care team,\u201d said the agency\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr. Patrick Conway. \u201cWe believe this approach will help create a system that delivers better-quality care, spends our health care dollars in a smarter way and makes people healthier.\u201d\n\nThe data for Toumbis, Stiles\u2019 surgeon, shows that his Medicare patients suffered complications again and again between 2009 and 2013. Some 44 were readmitted to Citrus and another local hospital in the days and weeks after he operated on them, an average of nearly one per month.\n\nStiles was released the day after Toumbis operated on her neck. Minutes after arriving home, however, she collapsed. She died before the ambulance completed the short trip back to Citrus Memorial.\n\nToumbis had written in her medical records that the operation went well \u2014 no complications and no bleeding. But an autopsy by the local medical examiner found bone fragments, as well as almost two cups of pooled blood from an \u201cextensive hemorrhage\u201d in Stiles\u2019 neck.\n\nThe examiner concluded that Stiles\u2019 cause of death was a \u201ccomplication of surgical procedure.\u201d\n\nToumbis declined several requests for comment and did not respond to a detailed list of questions. Katie Myers, a spokeswoman for Citrus Memorial, said the hospital would have no comment on Toumbis.\n\n\u201cOur hearts go out to family members when a loved one passes away after surgery,\u201d Myers said, \u201cbut sadly it sometimes does occur.\u201d\n\nFocus on Systematic Causes\n\nThe contemporary patient-safety movement has focused almost exclusively on systemic causes and solutions for medical errors, taking care not to point fingers at individuals.\n\n\u201cThis is not a \u2018bad apple\u2019 problem,\u201d the Institute of Medicine\u2019s \u201cTo Err is Human\u201d report brief said. \u201cMore commonly errors are caused by faulty systems, processes, and conditions that lead people to make mistakes or fail to prevent them.\u201d\n\nThis approach has given birth to an array of initiatives to reduce patient harm, virtually all of them aimed at hospitals or teams working inside them. They include using safety checklists for basic procedures, handwashing campaigns and urging medical team members to speak up when they see problems.\n\nFew would dispute the value of these steps. But Medicare and accreditation organizations haven\u2019t required hospitals to comprehensively track patient death rates and complication rates by doctor. Beyond meeting some minimum standards, hospitals are free to decide how much of this information to collect.\n\nAs a result, most hospitals\u2019 monitoring of surgeons is \u201crudimentary,\u201d said Dr. Ana Pujols McKee, chief medical officer of The Joint Commission, the nation\u2019s largest hospital accrediting organization.\n\nSome experts say it\u2019s time to put more emphasis on the role of individual practitioners.\n\n\u201cThe idea that it\u2019s all systems and there are no individual performance differences is absurd,\u201d said Dr. Robert Wachter, chief of medical service at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center and a nationally known expert on patient safety. \u201cA good system has a mechanism to identify poor performers and either make them better or get rid of them.\u201d\n\nProPublica analyzed 2.3 million hip and knee replacements, spinal fusions, gallbladder removals, prostate resections and prostate removals done between 2009 and 2013 on patients in Medicare, the most comprehensive source of national hospital data publicly available. Medicare pays for two out of every five U.S. hospital stays, and researchers routinely use the program\u2019s data to study the health care system.\n\nBecause there are many ways to define a surgical complication, we consulted with two dozen physicians to identify those that are directly related to each of the operations. These include infections, blood clots, misaligned orthopedic devices and uncontrolled bleeding. We then counted only cases in which the patient died in the hospital or had a complication requiring readmission within 30 days.\n\nThe American College of Surgeons has said surgeons are responsible for all aspects of their patients\u2019 care, from preoperative examinations to complications that can arise after the operation. Dozens of surgeons and patient safety experts interviewed by ProPublica agreed that surgeons can reasonably be held responsible for complications even if they are not directly at fault.\n\nProPublica\u2019s analysis has some limitations. Patients covered by private insurance were not included, which in some instances omits a substantial portion of a surgeon\u2019s practice. And our definition of complications does not cover other types of patient harm, such as diagnostic errors or readmissions more than 30 days after an operation.\n\nStill, the five years of data document a costly human toll. About 63,000 Medicare patients suffered serious harm, and 3,405 died after going in for procedures widely seen as straightforward and low risk. Taxpayers paid hospitals $645 million for the readmissions alone.\n\nGeorge Lynch nearly died from complications after a 2013 knee replacement. Lynch opted for a surgeon at New York Methodist Hospital near his home in Brooklyn. He couldn\u2019t have known what ProPublica\u2019s analysis shows: The surgeon, Dr. Henry Tischler, had one of the highest complication rates on knee replacements in New York State.\n\nLynch contracted multiple postsurgical infections and went into septic shock. He says his family, told he might not survive, came to the hospital to say their final goodbyes.\n\nTischler did not respond to a request for comment. New York Methodist said in an email that Tischler \u201csees some of the most challenging cases in the region, and goes to great lengths to ensure that each patient receives the best possible care.\u201d\n\nLynch eventually recovered, but he now needs another knee replacement. This time, he\u2019s peppering his doctors with questions and said performance data will help guide his choice of a surgeon and a hospital.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather be a difficult live patient,\u201d he said, \u201cthan a compliant dead patient.\u201d\n\nHigh-Regarded Hospitals Not Immune\n\nFew hospitals in America are more highly regarded than Johns Hopkins, which U.S. News & World Report ranked No. 1 in the nation 21 times in a row between 1991 and 2011.\n\nHopkins is also home to the Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality, led by Dr. Peter Pronovost, among the best-known and most influential voices in the patient-safety movement.\n\nSo it was surprising to discover that, according to ProPublica\u2019s analysis, a surgeon with an unusually high complication rate for prostate removals practices at Johns Hopkins.\n\nDr. Misop Han, an associate professor of urology and oncology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, did prostate removals on 86 Medicare patients in ProPublica\u2019s analysis between 2009 and 2013. A dozen of them had complications, our analysis showed. Adjusting for his patient mix and other factors, Han\u2019s complication rate was 7.6 percent.\n\nThat was more than double the national average for prostate removals in Medicare and three times higher than the average for other surgeons at Hopkins, who had excellent results overall. Three of Han\u2019s colleagues had complication rates low enough to rank in the best 5 percent nationwide, ProPublica found.\n\nHan declined to respond to questions about his results. He is generally held in high esteem at Hopkins. Dr. Alan Partin, the chairman of the urology department, said in an email that Han is \u201cone of the best surgeons I know.\u201d\n\nIn interviews and emailed statements, officials at Johns Hopkins insisted that by their measures Han\u2019s outcomes were \u201cacceptable\u201d and \u201cdo not differ significantly from his peers\u201d at the hospital. \u201cHis numbers are all within the expected limits,\u201d said Dr. Redonda Miller, the hospital\u2019s vice president of medical affairs.\n\nThe hospital said it tracks surgeons\u2019 performance using a variety of methods, including readmissions to Hopkins for any reason, even those unrelated to surgical procedures.\n\nHospital officials said a review of Han\u2019s prostate removal procedures between 2009 and 2013 showed his readmission rate for all patients \u2014 Medicare and non-Medicare \u2014 was 4.7 percent. According to Hopkins, Han\u2019s readmissions peaked in 2010, when he had 10 in 93 cases, a rate of 10.8 percent. Hospital officials did not specify his readmission rates for the years that followed, but indicated they had dropped.\n\nBy these measures, however, Han\u2019s performance still appears below average. Nationally, typical readmission rates for the type of surgery Han most often performed on Medicare patients are about 3.6 percent, according to two recent studies.\n\nHopkins said ProPublica\u2019s assessment of Han was skewed by its reliance on Medicare data, which omits hundreds of Han\u2019s procedures that were paid for by private insurance. The hospital\u2019s data shows that his readmission rate for Medicare patients was 8 percent, twice that of his non-Medicare patients. The Medicare cases, the hospital said in an email, are \u201chardly a statistically robust sample.\u201d\n\nBut compared to other surgeons in Medicare, Han performed enough operations resulting in complications to conclude with 95 percent certainty that he was an outlier, ProPublica found.\n\nHopkins officials acknowledged their overall readmission rate for Han reflected readmissions only to Johns Hopkins. But there were additional instances in which Han\u2019s patients were readmitted to other hospitals \u2014 cases that Hopkins would not have counted. ProPublica can\u2019t say how many because Medicare patient-privacy rules bar reporting any count of patients between zero and 11.\n\nIn interviews last year, Pronovost praised ProPublica\u2019s approach for calculating surgeons\u2019 complication rates, saying it \u201cadvanced the field.\u201d\n\nMore recently, though, he blasted our findings. \u201cIt would be highly irresponsible to present this to the public in its current form, or to make an example of any surgeon based on faulty data analysis,\u201d he wrote in an email last week.\n\nHe criticized our use of hospital readmissions to identify instances when patients had suffered complications after surgery. \u201cA readmission is not necessarily indicative of a complication, let alone a serious one,\u201d he said.\n\nThe panel of doctors that helped design ProPublica\u2019s methodology agreed on this point \u2014 which is why we only counted readmissions that these experts said were likely related to surgical complications.\n\nPronovost also said our analysis failed to recognize that some doctors are just more likely to readmit patients as a precautionary measure, even when there isn\u2019t a serious complication.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t seem to explain the Medicare readmissions data for Han, the majority of whose patients typically stayed at least four days and had specific diagnoses of postsurgical complications. Medicare pays for patients to return briefly to the hospital under so-called observation status, but our analysis didn\u2019t count these in tabulating complication rates.\n\nHarvard School of Public Health professor Dr. Thomas Lee, who specializes in how to measure patient outcomes, was one of more than a dozen experts who evaluated ProPublica\u2019s work. The differences between surgeons revealed by the analysis are sound \u2014 and important, he said.\n\n\u201cI think the methodology was rigorous and conservative,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI would be surprised if any experienced clinician challenged the basic finding, which is that there is real variation among surgeons.\u201d\n\nThe proliferation of health care rankings by government agencies and a growing list of private organizations have fed the notion that patients can reliably decide where to get their care by choosing the institution or specialty first.\n\nYet Hopkins was one of many top-ranked hospitals where ProPublica found surgeons with problematic track records.\n\nThe orthopedic department of St. Joseph Hospital in Orange County, Calif., has been rated one of the top 50 in the country by U.S. News & World Report. Yet one of the surgeons, Dr. Gregory Carlson, had one of the highest complication rates for spinal fusions in the country, ProPublica found.\n\nHe said his results could reflect errors in the data submitted to Medicare. There is a \u201cmultitude of inaccurate and confusing information that is provided to state and federal organizations,\u201d he said in an email.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s chief executive, Steve Moreau, said St. Joseph rigorously tracks and compares the work of individual surgeons, and that it has led to lower complication rates in spinal procedures.\n\nRank and title do not guarantee results, ProPublica\u2019s analysis shows.\n\nAt Chicago\u2019s Weiss Memorial Hospital, the facility\u2019s chairman of surgery, who is also the medical director of its center for orthopedics, had among the nation\u2019s highest complication rates for knee replacement operations. Two dozen of the 219 Medicare patients he operated on between 2009 and 2013 subsequently exhibited complications.\n\nIn a statement, the hospital acknowledged it was aware of the complication rate compiled by the chairman, Dr. Henry Finn, \u201cwhich reflects the complex cases Dr. Finn performs.\u201d Finn added that he\u2019s quick to readmit patients so that minor complications do not become more serious.\n\nHe said he was not surprised by the data.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m treating aggressively, and that\u2019s what I\u2019d want done for myself,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sad for me to hear this information. But I certainly hope it\u2019s put in perspective.\u201d\n\nDifferent Strategies Address Safety\n\nHelen Keller Memorial is a community hospital that serves The Shoals, a northwest Alabama region best known for swamp rock and rhythm and blues \u2014 not the quality of its health care.\n\nOn an early morning in May, Dr. Aaron Joiner and Dr. John Young stood in one of Helen Keller\u2019s operating rooms, flanking the left leg of a woman whose worn knee joint they were replacing.\n\nOver the next 46 minutes, they worked quickly, barely speaking. Young cut off part of the femur, and Joiner cauterized a vein to minimize bleeding. Their efficient teamwork helped to minimize the time the incision was open and vulnerable to infection. Joiner closed the wound as Young left the room to dictate notes for the medical record.\n\nJoiner has compiled some of the lowest complication rates in ProPublica\u2019s analysis \u2014 he performed 282 knee and hip replacements on Medicare patients with zero complications over five years. His excellence is testament to a larger truth: Many surgical injuries are avoidable.\n\nEven as the medical community has worked to reduce patient harm, it has remained common for surgeons and hospital officials to see a certain number of complications as inevitable. Just random bad luck, like a lightning strike.\n\n\u201cWe tend to shrug our shoulders and say this is just a natural part of doing health care,\u201d said Dr. Ashish Jha, a patient safety researcher and professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who provided advice for ProPublica\u2019s analysis. If a certain procedure has a 5 percent infection rate, doctors and hospitals consider it acceptable as long as they\u2019re at that or below, Jha said.\n\nYet if complications are like lightning bolts, they tend to keep hitting the same surgeons, while missing others.\n\nHundreds of doctors compiled records that were spotless. Dr. James Porter of Seattle performed 173 prostate removals without a single complication. Dr. David Black, at Freeman Hospital West in Joplin, Missouri, replaced 171 hips with no complications. In Leawood, Kansas, Dr. Thomas Rasmussen did 348 knee replacements with no complications.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a no-risk surgery,\u201d said Dr. Karen Joynt, a cardiologist and another patient safety researcher from the Harvard School of Public Health, \u201cbut some surgeons are able to make elective surgeries in selected patients pretty close.\u201d\n\nSome in the medical community worry that pushing doctors to lower their complication rates will prompt them to cherry pick healthy patients and turn away cases that could hurt their numbers.\n\nJoiner and his partners at the North Alabama Bone & Joint Clinic operate far from America\u2019s health care hubs, without many of the niceties that abound at name-brand academic medical centers.\n\nThe Shoals region, along the Tennessee River near the border of Mississippi, is not wealthy. Public health statistics show it has a higher than normal percentage of unhealthy people. About a third of the population in the surrounding counties is obese, and about a third smokes.\n\n\u201cWe take all comers,\u201d Joiner said.\n\nThe clinic\u2019s surgeons attribute their results, in part, to conducting more than half their procedures in pairs. They sacrifice volume and get paid little or nothing extra to have two surgeons work on a single patient. Each surgeon provides the other with backup \u2014 what amounts to real-time peer review.\n\n\u201cI may look at something a little backwards or get turned around,\u201d Joiner said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice for one of your partners to say, \u2018What the hell you doing? You\u2019re not out huntin\u2019 this morning. You\u2019re doing a knee replacement!\u2019\u201d\n\nJoiner said the clinic\u2019s outcomes also reflect a culture in which the work doesn\u2019t end in the operating room.\n\nIn many other practices, it\u2019s typical for surgeons to have physician assistants or nurse practitioners follow up with patients after surgery. Joiner and his colleagues do almost all the follow-up care themselves, personally checking with patients to make sure they know what to do and how to recognize signs of postoperative problems.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t cut corners,\u201d Joiner said. \u201cWe do it the right way every time.\u201d\n\nHistorically, this approach hasn\u2019t always been rewarded by the medical payment system. In fact, when patients ended up back at the hospital because of surgical injuries or infections, it was effectively a bonus, generating more billings on top of those for the original procedure.\n\nIn recent years, Medicare and some private insurers have introduced initiatives that try to upend these incentives. For example, Medicare can dock payments to hospitals if patients who have elective hip and knee replacements are readmitted at especially high rates, or if medical facilities rank among the bottom 25 percent for certain hospital-acquired infections and injuries.\n\nSupporters say these changes, while incremental, have spurred hospitals to focus on reducing certain poor outcomes as never before. It\u2019s not yet clear, though, if they will prod doctors to alter their practices, too.\n\nDr. Paul Dworak said he\u2019s too fed up to stick around and find out.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2013, ProPublica\u2019s analysis shows, the Edina, Minn., surgeon performed 277 knee replacements on Medicare patients with no complications. He also did 165 hip replacements with one of the lowest complication rates in the nation.\n\nDworak credited his results partly to spending more time on each patient during surgery, prepping them, making sure their implants were placed properly and closing their incisions himself rather than delegating this to an assistant. After operating, Dworak said he kept patients on medication to prevent blood clots longer than other specialists, even though this meant keeping close tabs on their lab results.\n\nBut this cost Dworak. He didn\u2019t get paid for the extra time he invested, and he couldn\u2019t schedule as many operations.\n\nDworak said such frustrations, coupled with reduced Medicare payments and the stress of meeting his patient safety standards, have prompted him to wind down his surgery practice.\n\n\u201cMy results were very good, and other orthopedists in the Twin Cities had horseshit results and made more money,\u201d he said. \u201cThe general public never knew what the results were.\u201d\n\nFlorida Case Follows Similar Pattern\n\nThree years before LaVerne Stiles chose Dr. Constantine Toumbis to do her ill-fated spinal fusion surgery, a remarkably similar series of events played out at Citrus Memorial Hospital.\n\nGeorge Bogner, a 43-year-old truck driver, came to Toumbis after worsening neck pain made it impossible to work.\n\nHours after Toumbis performed Bogner\u2019s spinal fusion in June 2009, Bogner began to thrash in his hospital bed, gasping for air. Inside his neck, more than a quart of blood had pooled, squeezing off his windpipe. He was pronounced dead that night.\n\nA private autopsy arranged by Bogner\u2019s family concluded he had died of surgical complications, but Bogner\u2019s death certificate \u2014 signed by Toumbis himself \u2014 listed the cause as \u201cnatural\u201d and mentioned nothing about internal bleeding.\n\nIt was the kind of case that should have triggered action from multiple systems designed to monitor doctors\u2019 practices, both inside the hospital and beyond its doors.\n\nThat\u2019s not what happened.\n\nLike all hospitals, Citrus Memorial has a peer review panel made up of doctors tasked with examining cases where the care came under question or drew complaints or lawsuits.\n\nBogner\u2019s case was referred to the committee, a standard practice when a patient died, according to a former hospital employee. The committee never investigated, even though Bogner\u2019s estranged wife later sued Citrus Memorial and was paid a settlement. Toumbis was not named in the lawsuit.\n\nThe gaps in Citrus Memorial\u2019s safety net are common at hospitals across the country, experts say. Facilities routinely fail to identify the kind of outliers spotlighted by ProPublica\u2019s analysis or to intervene when such doctors are flagged.\n\nPeer review panels, long the chief mechanism for physician accountability in hospitals, are a prime example. Such committees have an array of tools to help doctors improve, from sending them for more training to compelling that they be coached by colleagues.\n\nIn egregious cases, peer review committees can recommend that hospitals suspend or withdraw a doctor\u2019s privileges. Yet there\u2019s evidence that hospitals are doing so less and less.\n\nHospitals are required to report such sanctions to the National Practitioner Data Bank, a federal clearinghouse of doctor discipline used by health care employers. Reports dropped by more than 20 percent between 2004 and 2013. A quarter of American hospitals \u2014 890 facilities \u2014 have not reported a single disciplinary action in the past 25 years.\n\n\u201cPhysicians haven\u2019t gotten that much better!\u201d Robert Oshel, who spent 15 years handling research and disputes at the data bank until he retired in 2008, wrote in an email. Oshel volunteers as a data analyst for Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group. \u201cPeer review is not effectively protecting patients from incompetent and miscreant physicians.\u201d\n\nToumbis, 49, had privileges at another Florida hospital, Seven Rivers Regional Medical Center, as well as at Citrus Memorial.\n\nToumbis performed 316 spinal procedures on Medicare patients at Seven Rivers between 2009 and 2013 and another 247 at Citrus, records show. ProPublica found 23 cases in which Toumbis patients suffered postoperative infections or injuries after operations at Seven Rivers and 21 who were readmitted after procedures at Citrus. That doesn\u2019t include Bogner, not a Medicare patient, or Stiles, who died before she could be readmitted.\n\nAsked about Toumbis, officials at Seven Rivers said the hospital had a \u201csteadfast commitment to quality care and improvement\u201d and that many of the readmissions flagged by ProPublica involved patients who had prior back surgeries or complex medical histories. Officials said the hospital regularly reviews readmissions, but they declined to further discuss Toumbis\u2019 cases.\n\nColleagues at Citrus were aware that Toumbis had issues. ProPublica interviewed more than a dozen doctors, nurses, physical therapists and other hospital employees familiar with Toumbis\u2019 work. All said it was known that his patients experienced a high rate of complications.\n\nThere was also a troubling incident in his past. When Toumbis was in medical school, he stabbed a classmate in the neck after an altercation at a bar. He was convicted of assault, a felony, but was still able to get a medical license.\n\nThree people who sat on Citrus Memorial\u2019s peer review committee for years said they couldn\u2019t recall a single instance in which it did anything tougher than send doctors letters of inquiry.\n\nThe panel is called the Performance Improvement Committee \u2014 PIC for short. The dark joke among some hospital insiders was that \u201cPIC\u201d actually stood for \u201cProtect, Ignore and Cover Up.\u201d\n\nRyan Beaty, Citrus Memorial\u2019s chief executive for 10 years until he retired in 2014, said the leaders of the medical staff seemed uncomfortable with policing fellow doctors. \u201cThey\u2019re reviewing themselves,\u201d Beaty said. With such leadership, \u201cthe process is not going to be as effective as it should be.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if the PIC looked closely at any of the cases identified by ProPublica in which patients that Toumbis operated on at Citrus Memorial suffered complications.\n\nIn about 2010, a hospital official (not a doctor) presented the PIC with information showing that a number of Toumbis\u2019 patients had suffered tears to the dura, the membrane that envelops the spinal cord, during fusion surgeries. Such tears can be serious and should not be common complications.\n\nThe committee declined to analyze the cases further, deeming them unfortunate but acceptable side effects of the surgery, a former hospital official said.\n\nThe PIC also didn\u2019t substantively investigate Stiles\u2019 death from postsurgical bleeding in 2012, two former hospital officials said.\n\nPeer review is often undermined by the personal and financial ties that bind doctors together, according to experts and a 2008 study.\n\nToumbis was among the most powerful physicians at Citrus Memorial. He served last year as the chief of staff and, in November, was named to the hospital\u2019s board of trustees. He also rings the cash register: Between 2009 and 2013, Medicare paid the hospital $9 million for cases in which he is listed as the operating physician.\n\nEven when hospitals identify problems with doctors\u2019 competency or practices, they can face formidable hurdles in imposing discipline. Doctors have extensive due process rights that can mire even clear-cut cases in layers of mandatory notifications, hearings and appeals.\n\nIn early 2013, it looked as if Toumbis\u2019 pattern of problems might finally draw serious scrutiny. Prompted by reports that his patients were suffering high complication rates, Citrus administrators initiated a review of cases handled by Toumbis and two colleagues who also did spinal fusions.\n\nAccording to a former hospital official, they found that Toumbis had a higher complication rate than his peers but concluded that his results were acceptable when compared with what little national data was available. No action was taken. The hospital declined to respond to questions about the review or its outcome.\n\nToday, Toumbis remains a busy member of Citrus Memorial\u2019s staff \u2014 in fact, he\u2019s now the hospital\u2019s only spinal surgeon.\n\nn a January report called \u201cShining a Light,\u201d the National Patient Safety Foundation defined four levels of transparency in health care: between clinicians and patients; between clinicians within an organization; between multiple health care organizations; and between providers and the public.\n\nThe report endorsed all four, calling transparency the most effective, inexpensive and underutilized tool for improving the quality of care.\n\nIn the few instances where such an approach has been tried, there\u2019s powerful evidence that it works.\n\nAfter New York started publishing individual surgeons\u2019 mortality rates for heart bypass procedures, the state\u2019s overall mortality rates for bypass surgery dropped dramatically, studies showed. Some surgeons with poor results stopped operating or left New York. Hospitals upgraded their protocols to ensure best practices.\n\nYet overall, the U.S. health care system still provides little transparency about the varying performance of doctors.\n\nIn part, this is because doctors have resisted it. In 1979, the American Medical Association sued to bar the disclosure of how much individual physicians were paid by Medicare. The group won a court ruling that stood until 2013 and made it virtually impossible to publish doctor-specific data.\n\nEven now, the government mostly leaves it to others to provide the public with quality-of-care data about doctors. CMS\u2019 Physician Compare website, which is supposed to help patients choose providers, gives information on doctors\u2019 specialties, location and gender \u2014 but nothing on how their patients fare.\n\nA few hospitals have introduced programs that suggest the transforming effect greater transparency could have were it embraced more broadly.\n\nOn a wintry day in January, officials at Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, outside Detroit, convened a predawn meeting of the surgeons, residents, nurses and physician assistants who make up the orthopedics staff.\n\nBeaumont comprehensively tracks complication rates and other quality measures by doctor. Surgeons in the orthopedic department had grown accustomed to receiving their own results and anonymized data for their colleagues.\n\nBut at this gathering, department leaders unveiled each surgeon\u2019s performance metrics for the previous year on a giant screen at the front of the room. Dr. Lige Kaplan, one of the surgeons, compared it to being at school and having your report card shared with all your classmates.\n\nThere was undeniable power in putting the information out there, where everyone could see it.\n\n\u201cWhen you get that grade, if you don\u2019t like that grade or think you can do better,\u201d Kaplan said, \u201cyou either study harder or go to the teacher and ask, \u2018What can I do better?\u2019\u201d\n\nSeveral factors led Beaumont, which has more than 1,000 beds and is well known for orthopedics, to start tracking and sharing doctor-specific data.\n\nThe hospital had hired Dr. Samuel Flanders to be the health system\u2019s chief quality and safety officer. Flanders considered tracking doctors\u2019 results one component of a systemic, data-driven quality improvement program.\n\nHospital leaders saw Medicare had begun introducing payment incentives and penalties to reduce patient harm and knew this would continue. Also, the hospital became part of a Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan initiative that pays facilities to compile and share surgical quality data.\n\nMainly, though, the orthopedics department\u2019s results were not as good as the hospital wanted them to be. ProPublica\u2019s analysis shows that some surgeons at Beaumont had high complication rates for the procedures we examined in Medicare. Beaumont declined to supply its internal quality data, but said its numbers paralleled ProPublica\u2019s.\n\nOnce Beaumont\u2019s orthopedics department started tracking data by doctor, certain statistics jumped out immediately.\n\nFor example, too many patients were receiving blood transfusions. This can put patients at higher risk for complications.\n\nTracking data also showed that some of Beaumont\u2019s orthopedic surgeons had unusually high infection rates. Guidelines say patients getting knee replacements should receive antibiotics an hour or two before surgery to fend off such complications. Beaumont found that surgeons were ordering antibiotics haphazardly, some so late that patients still hadn\u2019t received the drugs when they were about to be wheeled into the operating room.\n\nThe hospital changed its practices to fix these issues and more, using the data as a road map.\n\nCollectively, the changes brought about a dramatic improvement in surgeons\u2019 results, hospital officials said. Indeed, ProPublica\u2019s data shows that between 2010 and 2013, the hospital cut its complication rate on knee replacements in half.\n\nThe meeting in January tapped into doctors\u2019 competitive side.\n\n\u201cIt gives the individuals a little extra incentive to look better,\u201d said Dr. James Verner, one of the surgeons there that day. \u201cWe\u2019re all competitive in our own way.\u201d\n\nKaplan, one of the better-performing surgeons at Beaumont in ProPublica\u2019s analysis, said two colleagues approached him afterward to ask how they could improve their transfusion rates.\n\nBeaumont\u2019s orthopedics department has continued to meet quarterly, putting each surgeon\u2019s stats up on the big screen. At the April meeting, the group was eager to see whether there had been improvements, said Dr. Jeffrey Fischgrund, the department\u2019s chairman and a spine surgeon.\n\n\u201cAt the January meeting, it was, \u2018Why are we doing this?\u2019 \u201d Fischgrund said. \u201cAt the April meeting, it was, \u2018Did we make a difference? Is this worth it?\u2019 \u201d\n\nSure enough, the group found out there had been a drastic reduction in transfusion rates compared with the previous three months. \u201cYou can influence physician behavior through the open discussion of data,\u201d Fischgrund said.\n\nDespite these gains, some of Beaumont\u2019s surgeons said they remain opposed to making individual performance data public.\n\nVerner said patients might blame surgeons for complications that weren\u2019t their fault and surgeons might avoid higher-risk cases that could damage their complication rates.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather work to improve someone than publicly shame them,\u201d Fischgrund said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you want to get rid of the outliers, you want to shift the whole curve.\u201d\n\nSome patient safety advocates say it\u2019s not enough for hospitals to share doctors\u2019 track records internally yet withhold this information from patients.\n\n\u201cIf you leave it up to altruism of hospitals, you end up with what we have now \u2014 just a few that use meaningful data to improve quality,\u201d said Dr. Marty Makary, a surgeon and professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \u201cBroader transparency, if done fairly and accurately, can drive this improvement with greater force.\u201d\n\nMarshall Allen is a ProPublica reporter covering health care and patient safety issues.
