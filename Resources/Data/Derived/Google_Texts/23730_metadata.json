It isn\u2019t. The 1-3-1 home record is, though. And this was a reeling opponent that previously this season had succeeded at only one thing \u2014 getting its coach, Todd Richards, fired.\n\nYes, already.\n\nThe Blue Jackets on Saturday finally cracked the win column in their second game under fiery new coach John Tortorella, and for Colorado, the embarrassing defeat also was a lost opportunity to collect two points before playing 15 of its next 20 on the road.\n\nPlus, the Avalanche is solidly lodged in seventh and last place in the Central Division, and at this point, it\u2019s little consolation that the division is likely to get five teams into the Western Conference playoff field.\n\nDid this anger or embarrass Roy?\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d Roy said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good hockey team. They\u2019re the ones who were embarrassed to be 0-8. But at the same time for us, it\u2019s a matter of us playing our game. It had nothing to do with our preparation tonight. We prepared ourselves to play against a very good team.\u201d\n\nThe Avalanche took a 3-2 lead on consecutive second-period goals from Jarome Iginla and Nathan MacKinnon and seemed to have awakened in time to avoid ignominy in front of a big Saturday night crowd.\n\nBut the Blue Jackets\u2019 Ryan Murray and Brandon Dubinsky beat Semyon Varlamov for goals 2:47 apart early in the third to put Columbus up 4-3.\n\nThen, even with a brief power play and a 6-on-4 advantage with goalie Semyon Varlamov on the bench in the final seconds, the Avalanche couldn\u2019t get the tying goal.\n\nWith that, Colorado finished the mini-homestand with a 0-1-1 record against two of the league\u2019s worst.\n\nThe loss came on the heels of a 1-0 overtime defeat at the hands of the Carolina Hurricanes on Wednesday. At least in that one, Varlamov was back at the top of his game, and that wasn\u2019t the case against the Blue Jackets. The Russian veteran was busy again, facing 36 shots, but didn\u2019t make enough big saves to bail out his teammates.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much to say,\u201d Iginla said. \u201cWe have to find a way to close that out. We let a very good opportunity slip away again. We\u2019ve let it slip away a couple of times already this year \u2026 We respect them, we know they\u2019re a hardworking team, but we don\u2019t want to be a team\u2019s first win of the season after a tough time, for sure.\n\n\u201cBut to be honest, it was more about us. We\u2019re trying to get ourselves up and going and trying to get back to .500, get over .500, so it\u2019s not so much about not being their first win, it was about us trying to put something together and get some consistency and get back on the winning side.\u201d\n\nAvalanche fourth-line winger Jack Skille opened the scoring only 2:21 into the game, but Boone Jenner\u2019s consecutive goals for the Blue Jackets put Columbus up 2-1 after the first period.\n\nAt 1:43 of the second, Iginla beat Columbus goalie Sergei Bobrovsky off a rush from the right-wing circle for his third goal of the season, tying it up.\n\nThen with the Avalanche on a 4-on-3 power play \u2014 it was a 5-on-3 for only three seconds before Gabe Landeskog went off for interference \u2014 Iginla\u2019s pass across the slot set up Nathan MacKinnon for the shot from the lower edge of the left circle that gave Colorado a 3-2 lead at 17:12.\n\nIt was downhill from there for the Avalanche, which now heads on the road for games at Florida on Tuesday, Tampa Bay on Thursday and Carolina on Friday.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Avalanche loses to previously winless Columbus Blue Jackets at home", "title": "Colorado Avalanche loses to previously winless Columbus Blue Jackets at home", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/24/colorado-avalanche-loses-to-previously-winless-columbus-blue-jackets-at-home/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151024__Avs-vs-Blue-Jacketsp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151024__Avs-vs-Blue-Jacketsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-24T21:58:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T11:59:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeab3\"", "article_summary": "Yet a little over two weeks into the season, Colorado hit rock bottom Saturday night, falling 4-3 to the woebegone and previously winless Columbus Blue Jackets at the Pepsi Center.\nBut the Blue Jackets\u2019 Ryan Murray and Brandon Dubinsky beat Semyon Varlamov for goals 2:47 apart early in the third to put Columbus up 4-3.\nAt least in that one, Varlamov was back at the top of his game, and that wasn\u2019t the case against the Blue Jackets.\nAfter starting slowly last season and never recovering, the Avalanche, from coach Patrick Roy through his roster, emphasized avoiding that in 2015-16.\nAnd this was a reeling opponent that previously this season had succeeded at only one thing \u2014 getting its coach, Todd Richards, fired."}
