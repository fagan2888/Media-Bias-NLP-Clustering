The ostensible topic is science reporting. But \u201cscience reporting\u201d turns out to be just a cover for a public relations campaign on behalf of Coca-Cola.\n\nI know this because Knight Science Journalism Tracker Paul Raeburn rose wrathfully to beg writers not to attend and to urge the Foundation to cancel the webinar. As Raeburn pointed out, not only is the session sponsored by Coca-Cola, both the speakers\u2013the only speakers\u2013have been supported by Coke and have used their professional positions as academics to work against public health efforts such as taxing sugar-sweetened beverages and posting calorie counts on menus. \u201cBut why on earth is a journalism organization allowing Coke to use its cred to legitimize this webinar? This is a scandal.\u201d\n\nAlso wrathful is Gary Schwitzer at the HealthNewsReview, where he critiques science and medical journalism. He quotes Raeburn at length, pointing out also that for four years HealthNewsReview has been on the National Press Foundation\u2019s case for these fairly naked PR moves on behalf of its sponsors. He\u2019s written several times about the fact that the Foundation has taken money from Pfizer for seminars on topics such as cancer, where the pharma has a big financial stake.\n\nSugar, sugar. I just can\u2019t believe it\u2019s true.\n\nSugar\u2013denigrations of it, that is\u2013is a topic on other recent blogs too. Nearly every week, actually. It\u2019s always a favorite with Marion Nestle at Food Politics. This time she\u2019s writing on the World Health Organization\u2019s call for comments on its proposed guidelines for intake of added sugars. WHO advocates that added sugars account for less than 10% (50 grams) of daily calories; 5% (25 grams) would be even better.\n\nNestle\u2019s post is particularly sweet and juicy because it fills us in on the politics and lobbying behind why this same guideline never made it into the dietary recommendations WHO issued a decade ago. The reason is not very complicated. A can of Coke or Pepsi contains about 40 grams of sugar.\n\nNoting that the comment deadline is March 31, Nestle says, \u201cWHO must either think that the research basis of the 10% sugar guideline is much stronger now . . . or that the political landscape has shifted so far in the direction of reducing sugar intake that governments will ignore industry groups this time. I\u2019m not so sure. I think WHO needs all the help it can get with this one. Submit comments here. Now!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Nestle may not be giving changes in the anti-sugar political landscape enough credit. Scott Clement, at the Washington Post blog The Fix, reports that the new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found that twice as many poll respondents think sugar is the biggest health risk than those that fear marijuana most. OTOH, neither group was a big percentage of the sample. Only 8% were most worried about pot, while just 15% listed sugar as the biggest health risk. Half the respondents were most worried about tobacco and a quarter about alcohol.\n\nAt the PLOS blog Public Health Perspectives, Lindsay Kobayashi doesn\u2019t mince words either: \u201cRefined sugar is one of the worst things found in the Western diet.\u201d She urges favorable comment to WHO by the end of this month too. Kobayashi also takes the oddly optimistic view that the WHO guidelines might be \u201ca stepping stone for health policy and the food industry to move forward together in reducing refined sugars in processed foods.\u201d\n\nSure they will. Gail Collins tells us that part of the federal school lunch law taking effect this year will ban candy and soft drinks from school premises, including vending machines. So you can see why the sugar people are in a panic, and why Coke has seized an opportunity to lobby journalists.\n\nGene therapy for HIV and selling Obamacare\n\nThere\u2019s a possibility for gene therapy for HIV infection involving one of the new gene-editing techniques, zinc-finger nucleases. I wrote about it at the Genetic Literacy Project earlier this week.\n\nThe post also mentions a couple of developments announced at the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections. For example, there\u2019s been another apparent cure of a newborn involving heavy doses of antiretroviral drugs. CROI is a pretty jam-packed conference, but you can catch up quickly on HIV developments if you consult Paul Sax\u2019s Really Rapid Review at his NEJM blog HIV and ID Observations.\n\nSax concludes with that clip of President Obama gamely pitching Affordable Care Act insurance to Zach Galifianakis on the latter\u2019s mostly lame online mock interview show Between Two Ferns. In case you missed it, my review is that it\u2019s mildly amusing in a couple of spots, especially the finale, but not worth 15 minutes of your time. Or Obama\u2019s, either.\n\nNice to know, though, that those highly desirable Millennials have a different view of Galifianakis. The interview was, for a time, the biggest source of referrals to healthcare.gov. No word yet on whether the youths stayed to actually buy policies, thus contributing to the actuarial demands of cheaper health insurance. Mother Jones has what it calls \u201cThis Week\u2019s Must-Read\u201d piece describing how the interview came to be.\n\nIntegrity at the Office of Research Integrity\n\nA few days ago, Adam Marcus reported at Retraction Watch that the head of the Office of Research Integrity had resigned his post last month for reasons that were undisclosed and mysterious. The ORI monitors alleged misconduct by scientists funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Public Health Service. It reports annually, ususually listing about a dozen findings of misconduct. These include cases of fabrication, falsification, and/or plagiarism.\n\nNow we know why David Wright quit, in his own words, because Science\u2018s Jocelyn Kaiser has obtained a copy of his letter of resignation. It appears at ScienceInsider.\n\nIt\u2019s a doozy. Most of his job, Wright said, was \u201cspent navigating the remarkably dysfunctional HHS bureaucracy to secure resources and, yes, get permission for ORI to serve the research community. I knew coming into this job about the bureaucratic limitations of the federal government, but I had no idea how stifling it would be. What I was able to do in a day or two as an academic administrator takes weeks or months in the federal government.\u201d\n\nHis beef is with the Office of Assistant Secretary for Health Howard Koh at the Department of Health and Human Services, ORI\u2019s supervising agency. Kaiser explains, \u201cHe writes that ORI\u2019s budget was micromanaged by more senior officials, and that Koh\u2019s office had a \u2018seriously flawed\u2019 culture, calling it \u2018secretive, autocratic and unaccountable.\u2019 For example, he told Wanda Jones, Koh\u2019s deputy, that he urgently needed to appoint a director for ORI\u2019s division of education. Jones told him the position was somewhere on a secret priority list of appointments. The position has not been filled 16 months later, David Wright notes.\u201d\n\nIvan Oransky has followed up at Retraction Watch by linking to Kaiser\u2019s post. Several intriguing comments. Wright says he\u2019s been told that his job is to make his superiors look good and to be a team player. He also questions whether a very political agency like OASH is the proper home for a regulatory agency like ORI. And there\u2019s lots more, including his plan to publish his daily log.\n\nThe journalist in me is salivating. The citizen in me is in despair over how much ammunition these stories are about to hand over to the enemies of government. No longer will they need to invent victims of Obamacare and the school lunch program. The truth is likely to be awful enough.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They'd like to teach the world to drink Coke The National Press Foundation recently sent out an invitation to a webinar for journalists next week,", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.plos.org/onscienceblogs/2014/03/14/coke-v-who-on-sugar-obesity-gene-therapy-v-hiv-obama-obamacare-v-galifianakis-david-wright-v-office-of-research-integrity/", "type": "article", "site_name": "On Science Blogs", "description": "They'd like to teach the world to drink Coke The National Press Foundation recently sent out an invitation to a webinar for journalists next week, something it does occasionally.
