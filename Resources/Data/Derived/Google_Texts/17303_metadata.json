It\u2019s part of the \u201cNational LGBT Outreach and Enrollment Week\u201d effort from the Obama administration and its allies that was scheduled to launch this week. Several agencies such as Out2Enroll and the Center for American Progress are collaborating on the effort, the Post said.\n\nNationally, LGBT advocates will be touting a new Health and Human Services policy that took effect Jan. 1, which states that legally married same-sex couples have access to the same plans a straight couple would in every state, even if the state doesn\u2019t recognize the couple\u2019s marriage, the Post reports. Out2Enroll has also launched a new Web tool during the law\u2019s second enrollment period where individuals can put in their zip code and identify trained LGBT-friendly assisters in their region.\n\nRecent research from CAP shows the uninsured rate among low- and middle-income LGBT people who are potentially eligible for federal subsidies declined by almost a quarter between 2013 and 2014, from 34 percent to 26 percent uninsured, the Post article notes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Illinois ad targeting same-sex couples advising them to get enrolled in health care under the Affordable Care Act aired in the state during the . . .", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights", "description": "An Illinois ad targeting same-sex couples advising them to get enrolled in health care under the Affordable Care Act aired in the state during the . . .", "title": "Illinois ad targets gay couples | health news", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 460, "identifier": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2015/01/Jake_and_Allen_460x470_via_YouTube.jpg", "height": 470}, "updated_time": "2015-01-14T17:53:37-04:00", "url": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/01/15/illinois-ad-targets-gay-couples/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An Illinois ad targeting same-sex couples advising them to get enrolled in health care under the Affordable Care Act aired in the state during the . . .", "creator": "@WashBlade", "image": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2015/01/Jake_and_Allen_460x470_via_YouTube.jpg", "title": "Illinois ad targets gay couples | health news", "site": "@WashBlade", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 13357499221}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WashingtonBlade", "section": "Health", "tag": "same-sex marriage", "published_time": "2015-01-15T12:00:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-14T17:53:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ACA, Affordable Care Act, CAP, gay marriage, Get Covered Illinois, Golden Globe Awards, Illinois, LGBT, marriage equality, National LGBT Outreach and Enrollment Week"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8d55\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 An Illinois ad targeting same-sex couples advising them to get enrolled in health care under the Affordable Care Act aired in the state during the Golden Globe Awards Sunday night, the Washington Post reports.\n\u201cHaving affordable care was sincerely a life-saving moment,\u201d Jake said in the ad.\nThe ad ran during prime time in Chicago last week and is also slated to run in other markets throughout the state, the Post article said.\nSeveral agencies such as Out2Enroll and the Center for American Progress are collaborating on the effort, the Post said.\nIt\u2019s part of the \u201cNational LGBT Outreach and Enrollment Week\u201d effort from the Obama administration and its allies that was scheduled to launch this week."}
