Now he was searching for his wallet. We were preparing to leave the house and drive to the Adler Geriatric Center in New Haven for another periodic check-up as we monitored the progression of David\u2019s memory loss. We didn\u2019t call it by its probable name: Alzheimer\u2019s. There are many ways to deal with denial, tact perhaps the gentlest.\n\nI\u2019d noticed that David had left a book bag by the door \u2014 that it bulged, looked weighty. He\u2019d seen me noticing, and his body language translated Don\u2019t ask. But while he was looking for the mislaid wallet, I unzipped the bag. There inside were all the books he had edited or written and a heavy brass and wooden plaque that named him for excellence in teaching at the University of Connecticut in 1983.\n\nHe was taking this, as evidence, to the doctor. These were his accomplishments; this was his brain in a book bag, and the only way to measure his intelligence. No more silly questions, thank you. No more drawing clocks, no counting backwards from a hundred by seven. As he\u2019d snapped once, \u201cGive me a real question.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s one. \u201cNot only do those I love change and die, but so do I. Who is that I?\u201d\n\nIn his years of clarity David had been a man who took \u201cknow thyself\u201d seriously. A man who respected the teachings of the Buddha but only sporadically practiced meditation. Face to face with the sorrow and fear Alzheimer\u2019s engenders, what caregiver, holding the book bag, would take away any strategy of brave continuance? Never mind that he took the bag to the doctor\u2019s but never opened it \u2014 I don\u2019t know why.\n\nLiving with Alzheimer\u2019s is, for the one who has it and for the caregiver, a process of \u201c living without the why.\u201d I\u2019m grateful therefore that I encountered and practiced meditation \u2014 more precisely zazen \u2014 long before David\u2019s illness. In the little anecdote of the book-bag, one can detect what Buddhism calls the three prime marks of existence: suffering, impermanence, and no permanent (or separate) self. Basically zazen asks us to put down the heavy book bag in favor of being present here and now. \u201cMoment by moment, breath by breath,\u201d as my Zen teacher Peter Matthiessen said, at times gently, then again with an inflection that combined admonition, affection and respect.\n\nOnce in the zendo, during kin-hin, a period of walking meditation that follows the longer period of zazen, an older woman a little ahead of me in the line lost her balance and tumbled, grabbing her ankle and crying out. Without thinking about it, I ignored Zen etiquette and ritual and broke my place in line, kneeling beside her and putting my hand on the painful leg. That\u2019s when I understood what Roshi had meant by no separation, by one body. The right hand suffers a scratch, the left hand moves to hold the injured other hand. It doesn\u2019t think; it isn\u2019t separate.\n\nBecoming a caregiver is living the fact that the other is no other than myself. It is taking the Bodhisattva vow to alleviate suffering. If this is so, then Alzheimer\u2019s is a zany, crazy-cloud Roshi. Don\u2019t-know mind is putting it mildly. But if you can practice some of the skills and renunciations learned in sitting meditation, things go better moment by moment, breath by breath.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He was losing his memory.
