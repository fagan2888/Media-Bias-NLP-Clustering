It just seems like it should be time for that.\u201d\n\nThe countdown to the Iowa Caucus has candidates scrambling around the state in an effort to secure their place on caucus night. For many of those that will be attending and casting their vote for their candidate, the choice isn\u2019t always easy.\n\nMany Iowan\u2019s are now very use to poking and prodding, questioning and researching the candidates that visit their coffee shops. A whole generation of Iowans have now grown up, groomed to engage, and eventually thin out, the field of candidates.\n\nThis caucus cycle in Iowa has been much different than most every other cycle, and McGuire agrees saying, \u201cit\u2019s not a typical caucus night.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think people really feel like we need to have the right person in the White House, and I think Iowans especially are taking that very seriously, and listening to everybody,\u201d is what is helping to make this caucus cycle different than most,\u201d added McGuire.\n\nFor many in Iowa, that decision to support happens on caucus night when they sit down with their neighbors and talk about the candidates. \u201cThey all know it\u2019s very important who we pick to lead our nation for the next four years,\u201d added McGuire.\n\n\u201cWe do this really well,\u201d McGuire said of Iowans ability to weed out candidates. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re first in the nation. Because we do it so well. We ask tough questions, we ask follow up questions. We look them in the eye. It\u2019s not a soundbite, it\u2019s not something on TV. This is real and I think it\u2019s very important. We\u2019ve been doing it for years, we take it seriously and we do it really, really well.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 147728192650}}, "article_summary": "We\u2019ve been doing it for years, we take it seriously and we do it really, really well.\u201dCommentscomments\nIowa Democratic Party Chair Dr. Andy McGuire was in town on Thursday to help the local party become better prepared to help Iowa Caucus goers on February 1st.\nIowa Democratic Chair Helps Prepare Local Caucus Officials For Big NightOskaloosa, Iowa \u2013 On the marquee in Oskaloosa, a sign informs visitors that former Secretary of State and 2016 Democrat presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton will be arriving in Oskaloosa on Monday afternoon.\nIt just seems like it should be time for that.\u201dThe countdown to the Iowa Caucus has candidates scrambling around the state in an effort to secure their place on caucus night.\nMcGuire added that helping people better understand and become more aware of the caucus is a part of her visits."}
