How does it feel? Pretty darn pricey.

Bob Dylan’s original hand-written draft lyrics for Like a Rolling Stone sold for $2.045 million at a Sotheby’s auction in New York Tuesday, setting the record for a pop music manuscript.

Almost 50 years ago, on June 16, 1965, Dylan recorded the song at the age of 24. It became a worldwide hit and an iconic work in the annals of rock music.

“The Holy Grail of rock lyrics has taken its rightful place as the most expensive popular music manuscript sold at auction,” said Richard Austin, head of books and manuscripts at Sotheby’s New York, in a press release. “Like a Rolling Stone irreversibly changed both the career of Bob Dylan and postwar music history.”

The final price was above the initial estimate range of $1 million to $2 million. The name of the buyer, a private collector, wasn’t released.

The auction was part of a sale called “A Rock & Roll History: Presley to Punk,” which brought more than $4 million total. The second best-selling item was another manuscript from Bob Dylan for the lyrics of A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall, which sold for $485,000.
