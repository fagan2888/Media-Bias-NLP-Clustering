Robert Shore thought he could. He was wrong.\n\nRobert Shore walked in his front door, dropped his stuff and sorted through the mail. In among the circulars was a letter from his insurance carrier, Assurant Health. The letters are almost always notices that the New York-based company had received a claim from one of Shore\u2019s Fort Lauderdale-area providers.\n\n\u201cI got this Assurant letter, expecting to see another like that,\u201d said Shore, 50. \u201cInstead, it had these big, bold letters\u2014\u2018This is about coverage.\u2019 \u2018This is about Truvada.\u2019 I started reading it. I was kind of floored.\u201d\n\nFloored because, after just four full months of coverage\u2014and four months of the company covering Truvada, a drug he takes to keep himself free of HIV\u2014Assurant had decided that it would no longer cover Truvada as a preventative treatment.\n\n\u201cOur records indicate that you have received Truvada in the past year with no other antiretroviral agents which would suggest use for pre-exposure prophylaxis,\u201d the letter read. \u201cProphylactic treatment is not a covered benefit as listed in the Exclusion Section of your member contract.\u201d\n\nIf Shore were to become infected with HIV, Assurant would cover it, no problem (Truvada is also used to treat people who have HIV, in combination with other drugs). But as for prevention? He was out of luck.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just him. Men in Florida and Georgia have reported receiving the letter. Truvada costs about $13,000 a year without insurance.\n\nAnd there\u2019s nothing someone like Shore could do about it until the end of the year, when open enrollment begins again for individual plans on HealthCare.gov.\n\nAbrupt Reversal\n\nThankfully, however, when contacted by The Daily Beast about this change in behavior if not change in policy, Assurant took 27 hours to issue this statement: \u201cWe are reversing our decision and will be reaching out to policyholders who received the letter.\u201d\n\nThe letters announcing its reversal began to be received on Thursday.\n\nNo word on how many people received the original letter telling them Truvada was no longer covered. No comment on whether people using medications to prevent other diseases, like heart disease or diabetes, had received similar letters. Assurant declined to comment further. And no word on whether other insurers will change course. Shore\u2019s insurance broker, Cliff Eserman, is worried that policies he\u2019s written for other clients taking Truvada for prevention may be in jeopardy.\n\nEserman received an email from one large insurer, saying that Truvada is not on the company\u2019s preventive drugs list\u2014a list required by the Affordable Care Act\u2014and so, even though it\u2019s on the drug formulary, would not be covered. But when contacted by The Daily Beast, the company, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Florida, said they do cover prophylactic use of Truvada and \u201cwe have no plans to change our coverage policy for this.\u201d\n\nWhat is clear is that all of these exclusions are legal, said Patrick Burns, owner of Burns Employee Benefits, a health insurance benefits company based in Oakland, California.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s legal. Sure, it\u2019s legal,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pharmaceutical policies of insurance companies are pretty complicated and oftentimes will cover one thing and not something else.\u201d\n\nThe problem, he said, is that \u201cprevention\u201d is nebulous. And when you have two prevention options\u2014say, one that\u2019s high-cost, like a $13,000-a-year pharmaceutical, and one that\u2019s not, like a $10 box of condoms\u2014an insurer is likely to carefully consider its coverage. Burns, who has no connection to Assurant, said it\u2019s likely that this decision has been in the works for months. There are protocols. There are committees. The process moves slowly. But, he added, \u201cIt certainly looks bad at this point.\u201d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

While many people thought these kinds of denials might go the way of rescission of coverage or denials for pre-existing conditions when the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, Assurant\u2019s attempt to cut off Truvada proves that\u2019s not the case. Many treatments, sometimes expensive, fall into a gray area of wellness and prevention, but just short of actual medical care. And despite all of the law\u2019s reforms, that ambiguity allows insurers to pick and choose what to cover and what to deny.\n\nPrevention Paradox\n\nOne of the big innovations of the ACA\u2014or Obamacare, if you prefer\u2014is that for the first time, it requires insurance companies to cover certain preventative services such as immunizations, HIV and STD tests, and blood pressure and diabetes screenings, free of charge. Those services are spelled out under Section 2713 of the law and include immunizations and specific services for women and children spelled out by the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration. It also requires insurers to provide free access to evidence-based screenings and services that the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, a government-supported, independent organization, has given an A or B rating.\n\nIt\u2019s thanks to this provision that you and your children can get immunized for free and that things like aspirin for heart disease ought to be free of charge under the law.\n\nTruvada, which was just approved for preventative use by the FDA in 2012, is not on that list. The USPSTF is a slow-moving organization; HIV tests were only added to the list in April 2013.\n\nThe ACA requires health insurers to provide so-called essential health benefits, such as ER coverage, inpatient stays, and prenatal care, as well, said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University Law School who specializes in health care, but it doesn\u2019t require insurers to cover other preventive treatments. These essential health benefits, and the preventive services they mandate, are laid out in so-called benchmark plans\u2014that is, model health insurance plans dictated by each state that tell insurers the minimum coverage they\u2019re allowed to offer in their plans. This means that insurers are no longer allowed to sell, say, health plans without ER coverage on Healthcare.gov. But it also means that unless a state explicitly includes preventive use of Truvada in their benchmark plans, insurers don\u2019t have to cover it, he said.\n\n\n\nThe issue is that Assurant\u2019s drug formulary does cover Truvada\u2014Shore and his insurance broker Eserman checked before he signed up for the plan at the end for 2014. Eserman said he even called the company directly to check if the drug would be covered for prevention, and got an affirmative answer. It never occurred to either of them that the insurer would cover the drug\u2014but only for HIV treatment, not for prevention.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this for 19 years and I\u2019ve never seen this before,\u201d said Eserman, who said he reached out to other insurance companies to see if they plan to follow suit\u2014a prospect that alarms him. \u201cIt\u2019s really baffling. There were no notations that if patients used Truvada this way that it would not be covered. It just says in the formulary that it\u2019s covered.\u201d\n\nThe Not-So-Fine Print\n\nAssurant issued the letters on May 1. By Monday, May 4, Eserman got his first email from a client (not Shore), informing him of the letter. The same day, Jim Pickett at the AIDS Foundation of Chicago got an email from someone in Atlanta, wondering if there was anything he could do about Assurant discontinuing coverage of the drug. Then, Joey Wynn, community relations director at Empower U, a community service organization and health clinic for gay men in Miami-Dade County, Florida, saw a Facebook post from one of the guys Empower U serves that he\u2019d received the letter. He\u2019d soon find out that two more men helped by Empower U got the same letter.\n\nBy Wednesday, a Facebook group dedicated to Truvada as PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) was abuzz and strategizing, and Lambda Legal, the gay rights and HIV-advocacy organization, had begun soliciting people who\u2019d received the letter to contact them. Scott Schoettes, an attorney at Lambda Legal, said in an email that the organization \u201chas been on the lookout for insurance coverage denials of Truvada as [prevention].\u201d The organization is \u201cexploring potential legal action.\u201d\n\nIn the letters received by Shore and others, Assurant promised to cover the drug for the next two months, but then they would cease coverage, citing the exclusion section of the policy.\n\nBut if you take a closer look at the exclusions section of Shore\u2019s policy, you\u2019ll see a lot of things that aren\u2019t covered\u2014nine pages worth, in fact.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t cover treatments for injuries that might be paid for by workers compensation\u2014even if you don\u2019t file a workers compensation claim. It doesn\u2019t cover treatment for injuries from car accidents if the patient is entitled to payments under other forms of insurance. It doesn\u2019t cover injury or illnesses that are the result of war or extra-military service. So if you work for a company like the former Blackwater, you better hope that company has a good plan. It doesn\u2019t cover \u201ctreatment of dental injury from an accidental blow to the face causing trauma to teeth, the gums or supporting structures of the teeth\u201d\u2014if you are watching a baseball game and a hit smacks you in your face, Assurant isn\u2019t liable. It doesn\u2019t cover anything that would enhance sexual experience\u2014presumably, your Viagra is out of pocket, pal. It will cover anabolic steroids if deemed medically necessary but it won\u2019t cover \u201ccharges to address quality of life or lifestyle concerns.\u201d No explanation of exactly what that means.\n\nAnd, finally, Assurant health doesn\u2019t cover \u201cprophylactic treatment.\u201d\n\nA Lifestyle Thing\n\nAssurant\u2019s move and reversal look bad, Burns of the health insurance benefits company said, because once you offer coverage, it\u2019s hard to take it back. \u201cThe question,\u201d he said, \u201cis if they feel like they can ask their members to make the switch to something else.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Burns said he sees an analogy between preventive Truvada use and weight-loss drugs\u2014another thing Assurant doesn\u2019t cover. They, too, are often approved by the FDA, and they are often marketed as a preventive measure against diseases associated with obesity, like diabetes. But Burns said insurers have been slow to cover them. It\u2019s that \u201clifestyle\u201d thing again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like saying, \u2018This is a choice that you\u2019re making, almost, and we are not going to pay for that choice,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nThe code here, of course, is that lifestyle equals bad behavior. And with HIV, moralizing and stigmatizing behavior can have drastic consequences. That\u2019s why Lambda Legal got involved. The fear is that people like Shore are being unfairly excluded from coverage and access because of HIV status.\n\nThe difference is that unlike weight-loss drugs, or other preventative services some insurers offer, like a discount on a gym membership, refusing to cover Truvada could put the insurer and the insured in precarious positions. For the insurer, preventive Truvada may be expensive, but treating someone who acquires HIV is much more costly.\n\nFor the insured, it puts the drug, which studies have found to be more than 90 percent effective when taken daily, out of reach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a more impactful thing,\u201d Burns said.\n\nGet a Life\n\nBesides, the \u201clifestyle\u201d argument has its limitations, said Burns, adding, \u201cIf you\u2019re married to someone with HIV, that\u2019s not a lifestyle\u2014that\u2019s a\u2026\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a life. And access to Truvada, even outside a marriage\u2014when someone is dating in a community with high levels of undiagnosed HIV\u2014can be the difference between life and death.\n\n\u201cWe sit in the epicenter of the epidemic,\u201d said Sprouse, the 52-year-old director of an Atlanta-area HIV prevention center. \u201cThe disease is out of control in metro Atlanta.\u201d\n\nShore compares the experience of dating in an area where a lot of guys don\u2019t know they have HIV to traveling to Kenya, with it\u2019s high rate of malaria.\n\n\u201cI took anti-malarial meds because I was in a high-risk environment,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I\u2019m in a high-risk environment here for HIV.\u201d\n\nNow that he\u2019s received, well, assurance that Assurant isn\u2019t going to pull the plug on his access to Truvada this year, he\u2019s relieved. But he\u2019s not at ease. Assurant announced last month that it will be shutting down its health insurance business by the end of this year (insiders say that the Truvada decision is unrelated to the closing of the business). And he\u2019ll be in the market for health insurance again.\n\nAnd Shore, who changed health plans at the end of last year to afford Truvada, isn\u2019t sure he can trust insurers anymore.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "HeatherBoerner"}, "keywords": "pharmaceutical, Obamacare, Tech &amp; Health, HIV", "publicationDate": 201505180915, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/tech-and-health", "description": "Can you trust your insurance company\u2019s drug formulary?
