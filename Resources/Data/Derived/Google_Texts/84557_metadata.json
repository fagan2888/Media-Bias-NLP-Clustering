Pete Sessions is one of the most conservative members of the House. Now he\u2019s being challenged by Tea Party activist Katrina Pierson in a race that may show just how far right the Lone Star state will go.\n\nIn 1994, campaigning for Congress against a Democratic incumbent, Pete Sessions drove across rural Texas with a trailer full of horse manure. A sign was attached stating, \u201cThe Clinton health care plan stinks worse than this trailer.\u201d Sessions narrowly lost that election by 4,000 votes. Two years later, with the seat open, the Texas Republican ran again and won.\n\nSince then, Sessions has established himself as a fixture in the Republican leadership. He ran the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) in 2010 when the GOP took back the House, and he has since become chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee. But now, after 20 years, nine terms in Congress, and another Democratic proposal to overhaul healthcare after his \u201cmanure tour,\u201d Sessions is under attack for being insufficiently conservative and facing a Tea Party primary.\n\nWith his white hair, navy blue suit, and soft Texas accent, the dapper Sessions looked and sounded like someone sent from central casting to play a generic Republican congressman when The Daily Beast talked to him outside the House Chamber last Wednesday. Bragging about his conservative bona fides, Sessions said that he was the most \u201cconsistently conservative\u201d member of the House and that when it came to deficit reduction, he was \u201cat the top of the heap.\u201d\n\nBut to his Republican primary opponent, Katrina Pierson, 37, an African American Tea Party activist, Sessions is \u201ca big part of the problem\u201d in Washington, D.C., who is always \u201cwaving the white flag.\u201d\n\nPierson, who spoke to The Daily Beast on the phone last Friday, was passionate and articulate in describing her agenda. She seemed resolutely on message, quoting Ronald Reagan with such frequency that it almost bordered on being a verbal tic.\n\nShe railed against the omnibus budget deal that just passed Congress. She said that by voting for it, Sessions voted with Nancy Pelosi to increase spending and against his fellow North Texas Republicans. The Tea Party activist also rattled off a list of government agencies that she described as a threat to liberty, including the NSA, DOJ, IRS, and EPA. When asked about Obama\u2019s speech on the National Security Agency earlier in the day, Pierson said she hadn\u2019t heard it, but she was still \u201cpretty sure he didn\u2019t go far enough.\u201d\n\nAndrew Burton/Getty Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) leaves Speaker Boehner's office after a meeting amongst Republican House leadership at the Capitol Building on October 15, 2013 in Washington, DC.\n\nThe Tea Party candidate said that she had decided to run because Sessions supported the farm bill and because he \u201cused his power to block [efforts] to defund Obamacare.\u201d (Sessions has repeatedly voted against Obamacare and was one of 144 Republicans to oppose the compromise to end the government shutdown in October.) Pierson also criticized Sessions, claiming that his campaign contributions come from PACs and lobbyists, not individual donors and constituents. However, Pierson hedged on the issue of taking PAC or lobbyist money herself, saying \u201cit depends on the PAC.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to Pierson\u2019s ideological purity, Sessions was far more pragmatic. In his opinion, the differences between him and his Tea Party opponent were mostly \u201cstylistic.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cwhether you vote no on everything or whether you recognize you\u2019re in the majority and if you vote no, you don\u2019t change Barack Obama [and] you don\u2019t change things. You have to be for something.\u201d Whereas Pierson attacked House Republicans for \u201ccapitulating\u201d since retaking the majority in 2010, Sessions seemed reasonably proud of Speaker John Boehner\u2019s accomplishments. \u201cOur agenda is what got us sequestration,\u201d he said. \u201cOur agenda is what got us and will get us billions of dollars cut in welfare and food stamps and other things, [and] our agenda is the one [that] moves our country forward.\u201d The Texas congressman conceded that \u201cnothing is perfect.\u201d\n\nIn contrast to Pierson\u2019s attacks on \u201cRepublicans who failed to keep their promises\u201d and \u201cwave the white flag,\u201d Sessions seemed to have friendly words even for Democrats. During the interview, the Texas congressman greeted Gregory Meeks, a liberal African-American congressman from Queens, who was walking by. Sessions joked, \u201cI was endorsed by a Democrat from New York yesterday.\u201d Meeks responded jocularly, \u201cWhatever you need, I\u2019ll endorse you or run against you, whatever helps.\u201d\n\nKatrinaForCongress Katrina Pierson.\n\nMeeks probably won\u2019t need to do much to ensure a Sessions victory. His district, Texas\u2019s 32nd, isn\u2019t favorable turf for a Tea Party uprising. It includes most of well-to-do North Dallas, including George W. Bush\u2019s mansion in the affluent enclave of Preston Hollow. Further, the incumbent has far outraised his opponent. Sessions had $1.3 million cash on hand, as of the most recent Federal Election Commission (FEC) reporting deadline, while Pierson had raised only had $33,000 (although she told the Dallas Morning News that she expects to raise $70,000 by the time of her next report. While Pierson does have some outside supporters, including the conservative group Freedom Works, commentator Michelle Malkin, and Rafael Cruz, the father of Sen. Ted Cruz, that likely won\u2019t be enough to overcome Sessions.\n\nThe margin, though, should serve as a test of the continued strength of Tea Party fervor in Texas. Pierson was an early supporter of Ted Cruz, who recently praised her as \u201cutterly fearless\u201d. While Cruz isn\u2019t joining his father in backing Pierson, his professed neutrality in the race does not exactly measure up to the scrupulous standards of the Swiss. With a vaunted Tea Party challenge to Sen. John Cornyn fizzling into farce, the Sessions-Pierson race will be the Lone Star state\u2019s most competitive struggle between the GOP establishment and the Tea Party.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "bencjacobs"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli, Tea Party, Ted Cruz, Texas", "publicationDate": 201401211045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Rep.
