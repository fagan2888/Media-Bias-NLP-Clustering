But Title VI can be a potent factor in building new homes in Indian country.\n\nTitle VI loans have ranged from the modest (the smallest has been $151,300 to an Alaska Native tribe) to the gigantic, $50 million to the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma. Most of them are on the smaller side, but some have been able to put a dent in tribes\u2019 housing problems.\n\nA case in point is the Yakama Nation in Washington, which received two Title VI loans totaling $15.8 million, financing the biggest part of 68 new three- and four-bedroom homes on their reservation.\n\nTitle VI works by a tribe pledging some of its federal housing money (called the Indian Housing Block Grant or IHBG) as collateral for a loan by a private lender. It is a way to use federal assistance to attract outside finance.\n\nRodger Boyd, deputy assistant secretary of HUD\u2019s Office of Native American Programs, explained the concept in testimony last year before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\u201cHUD has encouraged tribes to use leveraging as one possible tool to build capacity and maximize the impact of their IHBG funds through the Title VI program,\u201d he said.\n\nBoyd, Navajo, told the Senators \u201cUnder Title VI, HUD can guarantee 95 percent of outstanding principal and interest on a loan made by a private lender to an IHBG recipient for affordable housing activities. Borrowers pledge a portion of their current and future IHBG funds as security for the repayment of the federally guaranteed financial obligation.\u201d\n\nYakama used one of its Title VI loans, for $4.4 million, to address a very common problem in Indian housing development, lack of infrastructure. That loan went towards construction of infrastructure (which can include water, roads and sewer systems) for the Adams View development in Wapato, Washington. The second Title VI loan, for $11.4 million, went to construct the 68 houses. Both Title VI loans were made by Bank of America. Additional financing was provided through the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit program.\n\nMercy Housing Northwest, an affordable housing developer, teamed with Yakama Nation Housing Authority (headed at the time by James Berg, Oglala Lakota) on the project. Key Bank bought $12.2 million of LIHTC credits through syndicator Raymond James Tax Credit Funds.\n\nAccording to Teresa Garcia, senior writer for San Francisco-based Novogradac & Company LLP, writing in one of its publications in 2013, the 45-acre Adams View development piggybacked on an earlier 30-unit development there.\n\n\u201cA team from Seattle-based ARC Architects designed Adams View with six different floor plans for one- or two-story units. The units include three or four bedrooms, two baths, two car garages and large patios,\u201d Garcia wrote.\n\nAdams View \u201csites homes around a large 11.3 acre center green. The green has two basketball courts, bleachers, picnic tables, a one-mile walking path that winds through the park and the surrounding neighborhood. There\u2019s a conventional playground for toddlers and older children and a second \u2018natural\u2019 play area with logs from Yakama Forest Products, a tribal enterprise,\u201d Garcia wrote.\n\nShe noted the project was 100 percent occupied at the time of her article in 2013 and much of it had been constructed by tribal workers. The units went to \u201chouseholds that earn between 30 percent and 60 percent of the area median income. The 68 homes are required to be rented for 15 years, and then there are options for the tribe to continue renting out the units or to sell the homes.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Section 184 Indian mortgage program has far outstripped HUD\u2019s second Indian loan program, Title VI.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/08/26/big-dollars-housing-hud-title-vi-program-161504", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/u.s._department_of_housing_and_urban_development_.png", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Big Dollars for Housing From HUD Title VI Program"}, "abstract": "The Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Section 184 Indian mortgage program has far outstripped HUD\u2019s second Indian loan program, Title VI.", "keywords": "Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, Indian Mortgage Program, Indian Housing Block Grant, IHBG, Rodger Boyd, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, SCIA, Yakama Nation, Bank of America, Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program, Mercy Housing Northwest, Yakama Nation Housing Authority, James Berg, Key Bank, Raymond James Tax Credit Funds, Mark Fogarty, Section 184 Mortgage Program", "dc": {"title": "Big Dollars for Housing From HUD Title VI Program"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/08/26/big-dollars-housing-hud-title-vi-program-161504", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-08-26T09:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Big Dollars for Housing From HUD Title VI Program"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfdb\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHUD has encouraged tribes to use leveraging as one possible tool to build capacity and maximize the impact of their IHBG funds through the Title VI program,\u201d he said.\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Section 184 Indian mortgage program has far outstripped HUD\u2019s second Indian loan program, Title VI, loaning more than $4.5 billion to date to Title VI\u2019s approximately $200 million.\nBoth Title VI loans were made by Bank of America.\nTitle VI works by a tribe pledging some of its federal housing money (called the Indian Housing Block Grant or IHBG) as collateral for a loan by a private lender.\nThe second Title VI loan, for $11.4 million, went to construct the 68 houses."}
