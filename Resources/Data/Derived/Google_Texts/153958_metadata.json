The U.S. Olympic Freestyle Team will be led by reigning Olympic champion Hannah Kearney, who has won three World Cup contests this season, followed by Montana\u2019s Heather McPhie and Connecticut\u2019s Eliza Outtrim. Vail\u2019s Heidi Kloser, the daughter of vaunted endurance champion Mike Kloser, is joining the U.S. moguls roster.\n\nKloser, who was told by coaches to prepare for Sochi late Monday, said she was trying not to focus on the Olympics in the final three Olympic-qualifying World Cup contests earlier this month.\n\n\u201cI was really just focused on my skiing. I wasn\u2019t focused on making the team. I just wanted to ski like I know how to ski and the results would follow,\u201d said the 21-year-old. The results did arrive. Kloser\u2019s second-place finish at the World Cup on Tuesday at Lake Placid supercharged her chances for Sochi.\n\nShe\u2019s going to keep the same strategy heading onto the biggest stage of her career.\n\n\u201cI want to treat it like any other event. I know it\u2019s going to be different. It will definitely be a different story. But the program will be the same. Two jumps and moguls. I can do that,\u201d she said.\n\nOlympic veteran Patrick Deneen will join Montana\u2019s Bradley Wilson as the two men\u2019s moguls skiers competing for the U.S. in Sochi.
