No reason. They didn\u2019t plug in their car \u2014 they just unplugged me,\u201d Papadogonas says. \u201cNo note!\u201d\n\nAs of September, there were roughly 11,500 plug-in electric vehicles in the Bay Area. They come with standard owner manuals, but no Emily Post books on \u201cEV Charging Etiquette.\u201d Meanwhile, electric vehicle charging stations are multiplying at a fast rate across San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.\n\nSo, call these next-level first-world problems, but complaints like Papadogonas\u2019s aren\u2019t isolated. Though almost cultish in their support of the electric car community, EV owners are bristling at being unplugged or having to unplug other idle, fully charged cars. Even worse is finding their spots snatched up by non-EV drivers.\n\nCompounding the problem, industry insiders say, is a lack of standardization when it comes to the indicator lights that let people know the car doesn\u2019t need any more juice.\n\n\n\nSome feel there\u2019s an implicit hierarchy involving non-EVs, hybrid EVs and \u201cpure\u201d EVs. Non-EV drivers shouldn\u2019t ever park in charging spots, they say, whereas hybrid drivers could always \u201ctop off\u201d at a regular ol\u2019 gas station.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t park your MS in an EVSE parking spot unless you need to charge,\u201d a online commenter pleaded in a Tesla-related forum last month, referring to Tesla\u2019s Model S. \u201cOn several occasions I\u2019ve seen an MS taking up an EVSE parking spot without charging. I even informed a MS owner that it was discourteous\u2026his response was, \u2018but these are the best parking spots.\u2019\u201d\n\nForrest North, a former Tesla engineer and the chief operating officer of EV-software company Recargo, says he often hears stories like these \u2013 or experiences such incidents himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to this exact station and seen a brand-new Leaf, and on another day a brand-new Volt, parked in this spot and not plugged in,\u201d he says, gesturing to an electric charging station in a parking garage on California Avenue in Palo Alto.\n\n\u201cThat would be like parking in front of a gas station that\u2019s completely full and you just park there and go inside to get some jerky or a sandwich, while there\u2019s a line of people waiting to use it.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear how many EV charging stations are up and operational on the Peninsula alone, Papadogonas of ChargePoint says there are more than 2,000 stations across the Bay Area, and that the year-over-year growth rate is around 70 percent.\n\nSome are public stations, such as the one on California Avenue. Others are technically private, like the ones sponsored by local tech companies to attract and retain employees. And there are countless other charging options at private residences \u2014 as some people open up their home station to the general EV public by listing their address on sites like Recargo\u2018s Plugshare.com.\n\nMany of these stations are free to use. But even if you\u2019re getting charged to charge, the cost is usually nominal compared with filling up a gas tank: A recent report from the Santa Clara County Department of Planning and Development estimates that charging a purely electric vehicle enough for a 100-mile trip would cost $3.74, compared with $13.36 for the same trip made by a gas-fueled compact sedan.\n\nSo it\u2019s often not the cost, but the time it takes to charge, that lends itself to potentially impolite behavior. Charging stations consist of Level 1 chargers (110- to 120-volt outlets comparable to basic home outlets), slightly more powerful Level 2 chargers or Level 3 fast chargers.\n\nDepending on the vehicle\u2019s range and the type of charger the owner plugs into, charging up an EV can take as little as 15 minutes or as long as several hours, which means it can be hard to know when it\u2019s okay to unplug someone else and when it\u2019s not.\n\nIssues like these have spurred EV bloggers to post etiquette tips online. Brad Berman, a writer and researcher at Recargo-owned Plugincars.com, offered some tips this past summer in a comprehensive post, including: \u201cCharge only when necessary,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t unplug plug-in hybrids,\u201d and \u201cNo nasty notes.\u201d\n\nBut Marc Geller, a writer and advocate alongside Berman at Plugincars.com who focuses mostly on policy around EVs, dismisses the notion that some display poor etiquette at charging stations. He says he\u2019s never encountered any overtly bad behavior.\n\nStill, Geller carries with him a green laminated sign that displays his full phone number underneath text that reads: \u201cOkay to Unplug.\u201d He leaves this sign on the dashboard in his car when it is, in fact, okay to unplug.\n\nOthers have no qualms in being the \u201cunplugger\u201d themselves. Robert Olson, an Oakland resident who drives a relatively rare Honda Fit EV, says before he unplugs a stranger\u2019s car he usually looks to see if there are hybrids he could unplug first, or the cars are fully charged.\n\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t mind if you unplug a full vehicle, because they understand that charging stations are limited,\u201d Olson says.\n\nPlus, EV owners have one option that gas guzzlers don\u2019t: They can charge up at home, which the majority of them do.\n\nRecargo, along with PlugInsights, just released survey results that show the overwhelming majority of EV charging (more than 80 percent) takes place at home, with only 10 percent of EV drivers using public charging on a monthly basis. Tesla Model S drivers are especially likely to charge at home, the data show.\n\nIn Palo Alto, an ordinance was passed in September requiring every new single-family home to come pre-built for electric vehicle chargers.\n\nBut the PlugInsights report also notes that as availability of Level 3 fast chargers in public places expands, the amount of public charging is expected grow, too.\n\nAssuming public charging does grow, EV drivers and non-EV drivers alike might want to keep in mind a common adage: Mind your manners.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Brad Berman,car,ChargePoint,charging,Dimitrios Papadogonas,electric car,electric vehicle,EV,Forrest North,Lauren Goode,Leaf,Marc Geller,Nissan,parking,Prius,public,Recargo,stations,Tesla,transportation,Volt,volts,Culture & Features,Environment,Science & Tech,Frontpage Featured,Multimedia,Travel", "description": "With at least 11,500 plug-in electric vehicles in the Bay Area, EV owners are bristling at being unplugged or having to unplug other idle, fully charged cars\u2026.", "generator": "WordPress 3.5", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc955a\"", "article_summary": "In Palo Alto, an ordinance was passed in September requiring every new single-family home to come pre-built for electric vehicle chargers.\nAssuming public charging does grow, EV drivers and non-EV drivers alike might want to keep in mind a common adage: Mind your manners.\nThey come with standard owner manuals, but no Emily Post books on \u201cEV Charging Etiquette.\u201d Meanwhile, electric vehicle charging stations are multiplying at a fast rate across San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.\nBut the PlugInsights report also notes that as availability of Level 3 fast chargers in public places expands, the amount of public charging is expected grow, too.\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t mind if you unplug a full vehicle, because they understand that charging stations are limited,\u201d Olson says."}
