Traffic is smooth sailing on Interstate 30 east of Dallas on Saturday â€” a welcome break for drivers who experienced hours of delays there the day before because of two major accidents.

A 14-car pileup near Dalrock Road closed all lanes in both directions over Lake Ray Hubbard for hours on early Friday. Hours later, a wreck closed lanes in both directions in Royse City.

The first accident was cleared by around 7:30 p.m. Friday, Dallas police spokesman Warren Mitchell said. Crews in Royse City worked into the night. But a Rockwall County dispatcher said at around 10 a.m. Saturday that the roads were clear. And traffic maps showed no signs of delays east of downtown Dallas.

Both wrecks remain under investigation. At least seven people were injured, but no deaths have been reported. Read more about the crashes here.
