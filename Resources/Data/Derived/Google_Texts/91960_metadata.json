From Republicans\u2019 initial resistance to repealing Obamacare in its entirety to their relentless effort to chip away at the law by targeting individual provisions, withholding funding, and undermining implementation, the party is showing no signs of abandoning its anti-Obamacare crusade any time soon.\n\nOn this anniversary, ThinkProgress takes a look back at all of the milestones in the GOP\u2019s ongoing campaign to undermine a law that has defined national politics for half a decade:\n\nMARCH 23, 2010: An immediate push to repeal.\n\nImmediately after President Obama signed the Senate health care bill into law, 13 Republican state attorneys general file a federal lawsuit against the overhaul and Sens. Jim DeMint (R-SC), Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN) and Rep. Steve King (R-IA) introduce legislation to repeal the law. King even offers a discharge petition. \u201cIf we can get to 218, we can force Nancy Pelosi to bring a repeal to the floor for a vote. If the Senate can do that\u2026we have a chance to put a repeal on President Obama\u2019s desk and make him veto that bill,\u201d King explained. \u201cRepeal and replace will be the slogan for the fall,\u201d Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) predicts. Watch a compilation:\n\nVirginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli files a separate lawsuit in Virginia challenging the constitutionality of the law.\n\nJohn Boehner (R-OH) \u2014 then the House Minority Leader \u2014 promises that Republicans will seek to defund the measure. \u201cYou just gotta take appropriated funds to actually come through the process to fund the hiring of new employees, to create these new bureaucracies. I can\u2019t imagine a Republican Congress is going to give this President the money to begin this process,\u201d he tells Fox News.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic lawmakers who voted for the bill are receiving death threats and experiencing vandalism. Vandals struck the Tuscon office of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ), the Monroe County Democratic Committee headquarters in upstate New York, Rep. Louise Slaughter\u2019s (D-NY) Niagara Falls office, the Knox County Democratic headquarters in Ohio, and the Sedgwick County Democratic Party headquarters in Wichita, KS. Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-SC), the highest-ranking black lawmaker in the House, has said \u201che received an anonymous fax showing the image of a noose\u201d and authorities in Virginia are investigating \u201ca cut propane line\u201d at the home of a brother of Rep. Tom Perriello (D-VA).\n\nSarah Palin labels a map of vulnerable lawmakers\u2019 districts with crosshairs on her Facebook page and tweeting, \u201cCommonsense Conservatives & lovers of America: \u201cDon\u2019t Retreat, Instead \u2013 RELOAD!\u201d\n\nCREDIT: SarahPact/Facebook The ACA prohibits women from using premium affordability tax credits or cost-sharing payments to pay for abortions but also reinforces states\u2019 ability to prohibit insurers from providing any form of abortion coverage within the exchange. The day before Obama sings the Affordable Care Act into law, a Missouri Senate committee votes 5-1 to advance a bill that would deny insurers the right to offer abortion coverage in any government exchange. A total of 23 states now prohibit abortion coverage in their marketplaces.\n\nSome Republicans are initially wary about repealing the law in its entirety. For instance, in January, Eric Cantor told Politico\u2019s Mike Allen that Republicans \u201cWILL NOT campaign for full health care repeal, but will demand partial repeal, including mandates for health coverage.\u201d\n\nRep. Phil Gingrey (R-GA) admits there are portions of the legislation he likes \u2013 including the provision that would allow parents to carry their offspring on their insurance until age 26. \u201cWhen we say start over, we don\u2019t mean throw everything out \u2013 throw out the baby with the bath water. We mean, take the best of this bill and combine it with our ideas like buying insurance across state lines and equalizing the tax treatment and creating high-risk pools.\u201d \u201cOf course, all of the language regarding electronic medical records I\u2019m in favor of. So I might not fully agree with completely repealing and starting over.\u201d\n\nAPRIL 2010: Republicans actually take credit for parts of Obamacare.\n\nRepublicans admit that repeal is unrealistic. \u201cThe fact is that\u2019s not going to happen, OK?\u201d Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) tells an audience at Vanderbilt University. Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) agrees: \u201cIt may not be total repeal at the end of the day. It may be a series of fixes over the course of this bill getting enacted that allow us to change and possibly bend that cost curve down.\u201d Rep. Jack Kingston (R-GA) tells a town hall meeting, \u201cThere are a lot of things in this bill I think you and I certainly like.\u201d \u201cI think as a practicality you\u2019re going to have trouble repealing the whole deal\u2026 there ought to be areas where Democrats and Republicans can come together.\u201d\n\nJohn Boehner tries to take credit for some provisions included in the bill and promised to keep them in place. His refusal to call for a full repeal betrays a growing rift between leadership and the more conservative members of the Republican party. Rep. Steve King (R-IA) \u2014has repeatedly warned Republicans that \u201cif we leave any component of it in there, it has, it\u2019s just become a malignant tumor that\u2019s attacking our liberty and our freedom and it\u2019s diminishing our aspirations and it saps our overall productivity as a nation,\u201d King says. \u201cIf we can\u2019t come to that conclusion, then I want some new people to come help me.\u201d In April, repeal legislation had no more than 62 co-sponsors in the House and 20 in the Senate.\n\nStates like Ohio and Alabama approve petitions to remove their residents from requirements to purchase health insurance and to participate in the law\u2019s health plans. The effort was being orchestrated and organized by the American Legislative Exchange Council [ALEC], a \u201cbusiness-friendly conservative group that coordinates activity among statehouses.\u201d The Council is pushing model legislation to protect \u201cthe rights of patients to pay directly for medical services\u201d and prohibit the individual mandate. Multiple states pass similar measures, though the effort never proves popular.\n\nMAY 2010: Republicans offer a 9-page alternative.\n\nRepublicans prepare to re-litigate the health care reform debate by blocking the nomination of Donald Berwick, a Harvard University professor, to head the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The Republican Policy Committee preparesa memo linking Berwick to the British health care system and presents him as someone who supports rationing and a government takeover of health care. Obama recess appoints Berwick in July of 2010.\n\nWatch Republicans go at it: Republicans object to government-printed mailers informing Medicare beneficiaries about how the new health care law will improve the program. \u201cThis goes beyond propaganda and is blatantly political. If this document is really about Medicare, then why is there information in there about 26-year-olds being able to stay on their parents\u2019 policies?\u201d Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI) asks. \u201cThe brochure fails to inform seniors that the president\u2019s new law cuts $550 billion from their Medicare,\u201d Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) adds.\n\nRepublican leadership in the House introduces a 9-page \u201cbill\u201d to repeal the health care law and replace it with the Republican alternative already defeated on the House floor in November 2009. This is the third repeal bill introduced by the GOP, but the first to replace the law with different legislation. The Congressional Budget Office found that under the GOP alternative, the number of uninsured Americans would increase to 52 million by 2019. The bill could slightly reduce premiums for Americans who purchase coverage independently.\n\nJUNE 2010: Republicans make first effort to repeal the individual mandate, while arguing parts of reform should be better funded.\n\nCongress rejects a Republican effort to strip the individual health insurance mandate from the new health care law. Twenty-one Democrats cross party lines to vote in favor of the measure, while one Republican, Rep. Joseph Cao (R-LA), votes against it. The effort is led by Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI), who attempts to attach the measure to a motion that would have sent a small business tax credit bill back to committee with instructions to insert language invalidating the measure.\n\nCamp claims that the mandate violated \u201cthe basic principle of freedom and individual choice.\u201d \u201cNo American should be forced to buy or purchase health insurance they don\u2019t want or can\u2019t afford,\u201d Camp says, arguing that the measure would \u201cuphold the freedom upon which this nation was founded\u201d and obfuscate the need for more IRS agents. Highlights from the debate:\n\nCamp claims that the mandate violated \u201cthe basic principle of freedom and individual choice.\u201d \u201cNo American should be forced to buy or purchase health insurance they don\u2019t want or can\u2019t afford,\u201d Camp says, arguing that the measure would \u201cuphold the freedom upon which this nation was founded\u201d and obfuscate the need for more IRS agents. Highlights from the debate: Florida Senate candidate Marco Rubio \u2014 who had signed a pledge to fully repeal the law \u2014 tells reports that he would maintain the law\u2019s pre-existing conditions exclusions and the provisions that allow children to stay on their parents\u2019 policies until age 26. \u201cA small group of reporters in a D.C. coffee shop, chatting with Florida Republican Senate candidate Marco Rubio. He just mentioned that there are two parts within the Obamacare legislation that he doesn\u2019t want repealed. The first is the ban on insurance companies denying coverage based on preexisting conditions and the second is that he thinks that children up to age 26 should be allowed to \u201cbuy into\u201d their parents\u2019 coverage,\u201d National Review\u2019s Jim Geraghty reported. Rubio later backs away from those comments.\n\nCREDIT: AP John Boehner and Eric Cantor sign onto two discharge petitions offered by Steve Kin and Wally Herger (R-CA). The petitions will need to attract 218 members to force the House to take up repeal legislation that would eliminate the entirety of the health law. Herger\u2019s measure would also replace the law with \u201ccommon-sense reforms.\u201d The move was a significant departure for the Republican leaders who have previously claimed that they would like to preserve the more popular elements of health care reform and repeal \u201cthe other\u201d mandates.\n\n28 Senate Republicans write to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius arguing that the law\u2019s high-risk insurance pools \u201cwill fail to provide the assistance promised by supporters of the new law.\u201d The office of Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI) put out an entire release complaining about the lack of funds.\n\nAUGUST 2010: Republicans continue to attack HHS education campaigns.\n\nGOP Senators write a letter to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius expressing their \u201cprofound concern\u201d about a television campaign featuring Andy Griffith promoting the health care law. \u201cThe Administration\u2019s clam to \u201ccorrect the record\u201d is misleading and offensive. We can debate the relative merits of the new law, but co-opting public funds during a recession, to make a political, poll tested argument about the new law, is wrong,\u201d the write.
