Suspended D.H. Conley head football coach Brian Paschal will not seek a second appeal to his suspension. Paschal made the announcement to members of the media Sunday.

Paschal appealed the July 16th ruling of his suspension. The executive committee of the North Carolina High School Athletic Association denied that appeal Friday.

Paschal is being suspended for allegedly recruiting two North Pitt football players. He continues to maintain his innocence but says he wants everyone to focus on Conley's season now.

Paschal added he hopes to return to coaching the Vikings next year. He will continue to teach at the high school.
