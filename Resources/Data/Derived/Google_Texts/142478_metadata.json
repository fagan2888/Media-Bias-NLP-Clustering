Rand Paul (R-KY) is opening fire on Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and everyone else who backed or is backing Obamatrade without reading the text of the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) that Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) would fast track.\n\nIn an interview on Saturday morning, when asked about the revelation that Rubio and others in the Republican Party voted to fast-track the TPP in the Senate\u2014and many in the House GOP leadership have been pushing it\u2014without reading the text of the TPP in the secret room inside the Capitol, Paul went ballistic.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cThe American people are frustrated by Congress\u2014Congress has about a 10 percent approval rating,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI think part of that is that they don\u2019t think we\u2019re taking the amount of time to do an adequate job to read the legislation. It\u2019s sort of twofold: They don\u2019t give us enough time, and they also make the bills too long. I have a bill called Read The Bills Act, and in it there\u2019s a requirement that you have to wait one day for every 20 pages of legislation. So 800-page legislation [like Obamatrade] would wait 40 days. You\u2019d wait 40 days so we\u2019d have adequate time to read it. Yeah, I\u2019m a believer that we should read legislation before we vote on it.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s interview with Breitbart News came inside Joey\u2019s Diner, where several presidential candidates campaign. Paul gave brief remarks to kick off an event with local conservatives, then shook hands, talked with patrons, and took pictures with them.\n\nPaul also said that \u201cabsolutely\u201d President Barack Obama should immediately release the TPP text, instead of keeping it hidden from the public.\n\n\u201cIt kind of boggles the mind,\u201d Paul said \u201cWho\u2019s in charge of the administration that decides to keep a trade treaty secret? To keep it classified makes no sense at all.\u201d\n\nPaul also laid out how this deal would cede congressional authority to the administration even more\u2014despite Obamatrade proponents\u2019 arguments to the contrary.\n\n\u201cTo me, it\u2019s kind of you put the cart before the horse to give the permission to do something you haven\u2019t seen,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThey claim you\u2019ll get to see it, again but you\u2019ll only get an up-or-down vote with no amendments. Also, they get rid of some of the rules on\u2014I guess it\u2019s not, you can\u2019t filibuster it either. It passes with a simple majority.\u201d\n\nObamatrade has been infuriating Republican primary voters nationwide, and Paul\u2019s been riding his opposition to the proposal and his big victory against the National Security Agency (NSA) spying program this past week on the campaign trail here in New Hampshire as he tours through diners and does several public events in the Granite State.\n\nEarlier this week, Breitbart News reported that Rubio is refusing to answer whether he\u2019s gone to the secret room inside the Capitol to read the text of Obamatrade. What\u2019s perhaps most shocking about Rubio\u2019s decision to vote for such sweeping trade legislation his staff, by not answering whether he read it therefore choosing to give off the public impression he didn\u2019t, suggests he knows nothing about, is that Rubio decided to make Obamatrade a foreign policy centerpiece of his presidential campaign. He touted his support for it and why he thinks such a deal would help America in a speech last month to the Council on Foreign Relations. That decision seems to be coming back to bite him more and more, just like his support for the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d amnesty bill last Congress still hurts him.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
