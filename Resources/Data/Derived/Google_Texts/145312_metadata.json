Elizabeth Warren and Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan appeared at dueling West Virginia campaign events to back their favored candidates.\n\n\"Natalie Tennant and I do not agree on every issue,\" Warren said during remarks at a hotel here in Shepherdstown, some 75 miles outside of Washington. \u201cBut on the core issue \u2026 that defines us as human beings, Natalie and I agree. Our job is to fight for the families of America.\u201d\n\nAlthough both Warren and Tennant -- West Virginia\u2019s third female secretary of state and the Democratic Senate nominee -- spoke about education, the rally\u2019s main theme, they also focused on a wider range of issues.\n\nEchoing Warren in saying that they don\u2019t agree on every issue, Tennant suggested that they could work together in the upper chamber on most economic matters.\n\n\u201cMy number one priority as a U.S. senator is to bring good-paying jobs to the Mountain State,\u201d said Tennant, adding, \u201cThat starts with energy.\u201d (She later told reporters that newly released EPA regulations, which Warren supports, are \u201cdisgusting.\u201d)\n\nAbout two hours before that joint appearance, House Budget Committee Chairman Ryan sat with Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, the GOP Senate nominee, at a Charleston roundtable on jobs.\n\nIn a statement, Ryan asserted that \u201cfew states have been hit harder by President Obama\u2019s devastating policies than West Virginia, but Shelley Moore Capito has been right there on the front lines fighting back.\u201d\n\nCapito noted, \u201cWest Virginians told us today that they want their next senator to stand up for an all-of-the-above energy agenda that embraces coal. They want someone who will fix the problems with Obamacare. And, they want someone who will stop strangling regulations from killing jobs and small businesses. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m prepared to do.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have eagerly worked to tie Tennant to Obama, who in 2012 became the first president to lose every West Virginia county and who remains a pariah in the state.\n\nAsked if she would campaign with Obama, Tennant told reporters that the president would have \u201ca lot of explaining to do\u201d if he visited the state.\n\nThe president and national Democrats have damaged the party\u2019s brand in West Virginia and given Republicans a boost in this year\u2019s election to replace retiring Jay Rockefeller. Democratic voter registration recently fell below 50 percent for the first time since 1932, a significant metric.\n\nCapito is currently favored to prevail and become the state\u2019s first female senator. Tennant trails the seven-term congresswoman by about 10 percentage points, according to the RCP polling average.\n\nThe dual Warren and Ryan appearances further nationalized the race, as each candidate attacked her opponent\u2019s backer and tied the other candidate to policies that are unpopular in West Virginia.\n\nThe Capito campaign referred to Warren as \u201canti-coal Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren\u201d and released statements from Republican senators such as John Thune and David Vitter tying Tennant to Warren\u2019s positions on coal and financial reform.\n\nSen. Jerry Moran called Tennant \u201ctoo liberal\u201d for West Virginia, adding that Warren and Obama are \u201cat odds with workers and families.\u201d\n\nThe Tennant campaign offered a similar strategy at the event attended largely by a crowd of gray-haired voters, lambasting Ryan\u2019s budget proposals and portraying Capito as a tool of Wall Street.\n\nTennant also asserted at the rally that \u201cturning Medicare into a voucher program or allowing Wall Street to gamble away our Social Security in the stock market should never be on the table,\u201d an unsubtle dig at the views of her opponent\u2019s high-profile backer.\n\nHoward Price, one of the few African-Americans at the Tennant rally and a Vietnam veteran, joked, \u201cDon\u2019t get me started on Paul Ryan\u201d when asked if he thought the congressman was out of step with working-class people.\n\nThe Tennant campaign sent out a fundraising e-mail in response to the Ryan visit. A Capito campaign staffer told RCP that \u201csmall-dollar donors came out in droves\u201d after the announcement of Warren\u2019s appearance.\n\nDespite the pushback, both campaigns gladly welcomed their endorsers and the attention they brought. (In her remarks, Tennant acknowledged inviting Warren.)\n\nBoth of the high-profile lawmakers are rumored to be considering 2016 presidential bids, though Ryan has shown more openness to the idea than Warren (who has denied interest in running).\n\nRyan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, is one of the Capito campaign\u2019s most prominent supporters. Warren has proven to be a prolific Democratic fundraiser capable of energizing the party\u2019s base.\n\nTennant\u2019s decision to campaign with Warren initially came as a surprise, as the candidate has distanced herself from national Democrats on myriad issues.\n\nBut Tennant\u2019s campaign aggressively pushed back against the claim that Warren\u2019s brand of progressivism doesn\u2019t fit well in West Virginia. Before the two women took the stage, Tennant supporters chanted, \u201cA vote for Main Street, not for Wall Street.\u201d\n\nWarren echoed the sentiment: \u201cWhat I like about Natalie is, she\u2019s ready to fight.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. -- A low-key Senate race received a jolt of adrenaline Tuesday when Massachusetts Sen.
