Connect for Health Colorado has spent over $80 million to set up and market Colorado’s health exchange website. But in October only 3,736 people actually completed the process and signed up.

"My generation does not only think about sex, birth control or getting hammered."

Enter the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative and ProgressNow Colorado, creators of the “Thanks Obamacare” ad campaign.

Does the left really think our generation is that shallow?

The left is perverted and the lens through which they view my generation is inaccurate.

My generation does not only think about sex, birth control or getting hammered.
