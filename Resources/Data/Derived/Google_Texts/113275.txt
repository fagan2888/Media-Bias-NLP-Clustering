NEW YORK (MainStreet) — The recent increases in income inequality in the United States and elsewhere can have many wide-ranging impacts--including on children’s health.

Namely, a new report published in the Lancet earlier this month, finds that health inequalities have increased in adolescents in many developed nations in tandem with rising socioeconomic disparities.

The report, based on research led by psychologist Frank Elgar of McGill University’s Institute for Health and Social Policy, found that growing disparities in the mental and physical health of 11- to 15-year-olds in both Europe and North America have coincided with the widening gap between high and low income populations.

The research--which was supported by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the Canada Research Chairs Programme--relied on data from the World Health Organization’s Health Behaviour in School-aged Children. Specifically, the researchers examined the health of nearly a half-million adolescents in 34 countries between 2002 and 2010.

Elgar and his colleagues found that even though the health of children improved overall, it has also become increasing unequal based on income. These inequalities were illustrated in factors ranging from body mass to physical activity to mental health, all of which fluctuated widely between affluent and disadvantaged youths.

“Health inequalities in youths shape future inequities in education, employment, adult health, and life expectancy, and should be a focus of health policy,” said Elgar, who is also an associate professor in the Faculty of Medicine’s Department of Psychiatry and researcher at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute.
