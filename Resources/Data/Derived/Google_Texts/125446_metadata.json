Trump bragged in an hour-long speech of how he has upended political convention this year in the name of liberating the nation from its feckless leaders.\n\nTrump and Carson hold the top two spots in polls for the Republican presidential nomination next year, and both spent their weekend courting Georgia voters with a night-and-day contrast.\n\nThe real estate mogul Trump trades in bombast. Cross him, and you feel the burn. He ridiculed his political opponents, from Jeb Bush to Marco Rubio to Hillary Clinton. He excoriated the \u201cstupid\u201d people now running the country, contrasting them with the master deal-maker he promised to be in the Oval Office.\n\nCarson\u2019s jokes were mostly at his own expense, about his poor childhood and bad grades in school. The former neurosurgeon did not mention other candidates by name. In denigrating the new health care law, Carson referred to it as \u201cthe so-called Affordable Care Act\u201d instead of its colloquial name, Obamacare.\n\n+ Branden Camp Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson speaks during a church service at Free Chapel, Sunday, Oct. 11, 2015, in Gainesville, Ga. ... read more Branden Camp \u00d7\n\nOn the campaign trail, the two have circled each other without clashing, aside from a brief dust-up.\n\nAt a news conference, Trump pointed out that Carson apologized for a statement seen as dismissive of Trump\u2019s faith, \u201cwhich is a very honorable thing to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love it when they hit me because so far, as you know, everybody I\u2019ve hit has gone down the tubes,\u201d Trump said.\n\nRelated Photos: Dr. Ben Carson speaks in Gainesville\n\nAsked by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution about his and Trump\u2019s shared success, Carson said it\u2019s a sign of a public searching for something new.\n\n\u201cIt says that the people are waking up and they\u2019re starting to realize that listening to the pundits and the experts and the news media probably is not the right thing to do because it\u2019s not leading us in the right place,\u201d Carson said at a book signing Saturday in Lawrenceville.\n\nHe said he had no idea Trump had been nearby just hours before.\n\nTheir Georgia supporters this weekend had much in common in backing two candidates who have never run for office.\n\n\u201cWe always had people who have been in government \u2014 yet it\u2019s still not working,\u201d said Terrance Hunter of Atlanta.\n\nStanding behind Hunter in line for Carson\u2019s book signing in Lawrenceville, Sandra Hopkins of Bremen, jumped in.\n\n\u201cAmen!\u201d she said, sharing a high-five with Hunter. \u201cHow many thousands of years of experience did (previous presidents) have in Congress and the Senate?\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s success in real estate and Carson\u2019s steady hand in brain surgery \u2014 and his compelling climb from poverty \u2014 were satisfactory real-world qualifications for the presidency, their supporters said. They were confident the novice politicians could surround themselves with the right experts in order to master national security and domestic policy.\n\nWhile some of Carson\u2019s fans interviewed by the AJC were fine with Trump, several turned up their noses at the billionaire\u2019s approach.\n\nCarson is \u201cbold, but he\u2019s a quiet, controlled bold,\u201d said Linda Gore of Athens. \u201cWhereas Trump is all pomp and noise and stuff.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters, meanwhile, are fond of the swagger.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got the presidential stature that we need back in the White House,\u201d said Wanda Raper of McDonough.\n\nThe Trump fans interviewed by the AJC, while disdainful of traditional politicians, mostly embraced the fellow outsider Carson.\n\nTrump \u201carticulates, like Ben Carson is starting to articulate, these things that outside of the coasts of the country, people really do think this way, and they\u2019re bashed for it all the time,\u201d said Larry Wachs of Peachtree Corners, who attended the Trump rally and used to star on the local radio show \u201cThe Regular Guys.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with saying \u2018I love America,\u2019 but we\u2019re presented as rednecks and idiots. It\u2019s shocking to the media when Ben Carson says \u2018I don\u2019t want a Muslim being president.\u2019 But it\u2019s not to most of America.\u201d\n\nThe backers of both men share the candidates\u2019 dim view of the current state of America. Trump\u2019s diagnosis is, in part, a failure of negotiating know-how against other nations.\n\n\u201cWhat China has done to the United States may be the greatest theft in the history of the world,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken our jobs. They\u2019ve taken our money. They\u2019ve taken our base. They\u2019ve really taken our spirit. We feel horrible.\u201d\n\nCarson said \u201cyou\u2019re hard-pressed to find anybody who thinks this is the right direction.\u201d But he quickly moves to optimism in the land of opportunity, which can be turned around with more faith in God \u2014 and a defeat of political correctness.\n\n\u201cAmerica is worth saving,\u201d Carson said. \u201cIf that means getting into a war with the PC police, I\u2019m ready to fight that war. And I hope you will join me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ben Carson began Sunday morning with a soft-spoken prayer in front of a packed Hall County megachurch before delivering a measured defense of God as part of the fabric of American government.", "author": "By Daniel Malloy - The Atlanta Journal-Constitution", "og": {"url": "http://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/carson-trump-contrasting-personalities-seeking-the/nnzdb/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/11/9c/34/101215-Carson-Trump3.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Ben Carson began Sunday morning with a soft-spoken prayer in front of a packed Hall County megachurch before delivering a measured defense of God as part of the fabric of American government.", "title": "Carson, Trump contrasting personalities seeking the outsider vote"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2015/10/11/9c/34/101215-Carson-Trump3.jpg", "description": "Ben Carson began Sunday morning with a soft-spoken prayer in front of a packed Hall County megachurch before delivering a measured defense of God as part of the fabric of American government.", "card": "summary", "title": "Carson, Trump contrasting personalities seeking the outsider vote"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "myajc", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/carson-trump-contrasting-personalities-seeking-the/nnzdb/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3095863/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/carson-trump-contrasting-personalities-seeking-the/nnzdb/", "keywords": "ajc-fedstategovt,politics_ajc,story-tpt-id:8340", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Trump fans interviewed by the AJC, while disdainful of traditional politicians, mostly embraced the fellow outsider Carson.\nRelated Photos: Dr. Ben Carson speaks in GainesvilleAsked by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution about his and Trump\u2019s shared success, Carson said it\u2019s a sign of a public searching for something new.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve taken our jobs.\nThey\u2019ve taken our money.\nThey\u2019ve taken our base."}
