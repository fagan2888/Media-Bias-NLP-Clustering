They also claim the plan avoids premature deaths by getting rid of the pollutants.\n\nHowever Bissett doesn\u2019t totally agree with that assumption and thinks the American coal industry should not be heavily regulated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to realize the coal-fired power plants in this county only emit 3-percent of the man-made carbon of this plant and if all of them were to close tomorrow it would only decrease 3-percent which would be quickly made up by all the other coal-fired power plants all over the world,\u201d said Bissett.\n\nThe Ratepayer Protection Act passed the House on Wednesday by 247-180. It now heads to the Senate for a vote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Environmental Protection Agency is under attack again from Congressional Republicans, this time over a plan the Obama administration enacted last year to cut down on greenhouse gases.", "language": "english", "author": "Nicholas Starling", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Ratepayer-Protection-Act-passes-House-heads-to-Senate-309672171.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/power+plant15.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency is under attack again from Congressional Republicans, this time over a plan the Obama administration enacted last year to cut down on greenhouse gases.", "title": "Ratepayer Protection Act passes House, heads to Senate"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency is under attack again from Congressional Republicans, this time over a plan the Obama administration enacted last year to cut down on greenhouse gases.", "title": "Ratepayer Protection Act passes House, heads to Senate", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Ratepayer-Protection-Act-passes-House-heads-to-Senate-309672171.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/power+plant15.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "keywords": "Ratepayer Protection Act passes House, heads to Senate", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ratepayer Protection Act passes House"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd271f\"", "article_summary": "The Ratepayer Protection Act passed the House on Wednesday by 247-180.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to realize the coal-fired power plants in this county only emit 3-percent of the man-made carbon of this plant and if all of them were to close tomorrow it would only decrease 3-percent which would be quickly made up by all the other coal-fired power plants all over the world,\u201d said Bissett.\nKentucky Congressman Ed Whitfield along with several of his colleagues say they are fed up with the EPA\u2019s regulations on energy.\nSome lawmakers say your electric bills will rise and the regulations could be illegal.\n\u201cUnder this regulation, for the first time ever the EPA is setting the standard for every state in America,\u201d said Whitfield."}
