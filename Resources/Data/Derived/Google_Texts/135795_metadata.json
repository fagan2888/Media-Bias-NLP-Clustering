(AP) - Poor, obese South Carolinians covered by Medicaid can get help slimming down through nutritional counseling sessions aimed at stemming chronic and costly health problems.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services added the weight-loss services this month for the estimated 184,000 Medicaid-covered adults with a body mass index of 30 or more, which is the definition of obese. That roughly translates to a 5-foot-8 adult weighing more than 200 pounds.\n\nThe goal is to reduce obesity rates in a state that consistently ranks among the fattest nationwide, saving both lives and money.\n\nNearly 32 percent of South Carolina adults are obese, up from 25 percent in 2004 and 12 percent in 1990. The state ranks among the worst nationwide in obesity-related diabetes and hypertension, according to the Trust for America\u2019s Health.\n\nPatients in counseling can learn how to prevent such chronic diseases with healthy habits they pass on to younger generations, hopefully improving the state\u2019s overall health, said Jamie Kandora, a registered dietitian with Tidelands Health, which operates along the Grand Strand.\n\nWith a doctor\u2019s referral, patients can receive individualized behavior and nutritional advice from doctors and licensed dietitians.\n\nMedicaid will pay for up to 12 counseling visits that can include lessons on metabolism and exercise, cooking tips, and help planning healthy meals on a limited budget.\n\nSome people don\u2019t eat healthy because they think it\u2019s too expensive, but it doesn\u2019t have to be, Kandora said.\n\n\u201cDietitians are particularly good at meeting patients where they\u2019re at, not saying, \u2018Only shop at Whole Foods and eat organic,\u2019 but here\u2019s how can we inch you closer\u201d to a healthy weight based on your situation, said Nina Crowley, a registered dietitian at the Medical University of South Carolina. \u201cIt\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all approach.\u201d\n\nThe program\u2019s development began under former Medicaid director Tony Keck, who presented the idea to legislators last year.\n\nChristian Soura, who took the agency\u2019s helm last November, said the program is somewhat experimental and may need to be adjusted later. Evaluations over the next year will determine whether more office visits, for example, are needed to improve success rates.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many people will participate, but the program\u2019s estimated cost for this fiscal year is $5.6 million.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s see how it goes,\u201d Soura said Wednesday. \u201cThere\u2019s an expectation there will be a gradual ramp up, and we\u2019ll see if this version of the model works or not.\u201d\n\nSo far, 45 independent licensed dietitians have enrolled to be Medicaid providers. Others are employed through participating hospitals. The agency\u2019s 43 dietitians can also assist with counseling services, according to the agency.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Poor, obese South Carolinians covered by Medicaid can get help slimming down through nutritional counseling sessions aimed at stemming chronic and costly health problems.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/15/medicaid-offers-nutrition-counseling-to-combat-obe/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Poor, obese South Carolinians covered by Medicaid can get help slimming down through nutritional counseling sessions aimed at stemming chronic and costly health problems.", "title": "Medicaid offers nutrition counseling to combat obesity in SC"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Poor, obese South Carolinians covered by Medicaid can get help slimming down through nutritional counseling sessions aimed at stemming chronic and costly health problems.", "card": "summary", "title": "Medicaid offers nutrition counseling to combat obesity in SC"}, "Author": "SEANNA ADCOX", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "The agency\u2019s 43 dietitians can also assist with counseling services, according to the agency.\nCOLUMBIA, S.C.
