The business lobby association is pushing state legislators to crack down on trial lawyers\u2014including one big name in the industry.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Chamber\u2019s Harold Kim says South Florida\u2014specifically Miami-Dade, is a hotbed of what he calls bogus lawsuits against businesses. Bad faith claims are a big problem, Kim said, but so is direct-advertising.\n\n\u201cWe know for a fact that the most expensive per-click word in the google-sphere is \u2018mesothelioma\u2019. It\u2019s over $100 per click. And that speaks to something that I think is far broader, far bigger than just being there, 'for the people'.\u201d\n\nThat last dig is a direct-shot at mega-trial lawyer John Morgan, and his Morgan-and-Morgan law firm. The firm uses the slogan, \u201cfor the people\u201d.\n\nBut its not just Morgan who is a target. The U.S. chamber is also critical of the Florida Supreme Court--saying justices have reversed some of the legal reforms the state legislature put in place, such as medical malpractice.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re inured because you were wronged by another person, you should absolutely seek recovery in the court system. Unfortunately, the court system and the way its operating now when its all about attorney\u2019s fees and huge jack-pot awards, that where its out-of-whack,\" Kim said.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber wants Florida lawmakers to reconsider legal reforms that limit attorney\u2019s fees and the type of lawsuits that can be brought against companies, But consumer-groups have been critical of business-backed tort reforms, saying many of those plans put purchasers on the losing end.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says Florida\u2019s lawsuit climate is among the worst in the nation\u2014for businesses.
