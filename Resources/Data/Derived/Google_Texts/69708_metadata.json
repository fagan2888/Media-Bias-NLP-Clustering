Uber is appealing; classifying drivers as independent contractors is central to its (booming) business model.\n\n\u201cThe companies are setting rules and guidelines and threatening termination when the workers don\u2019t follow those rules,\u201d Liss-Riordan told the Journal. \u201cIt\u2019s an inherent tension: They want to control their workers so they can provide a level of service that will grow their business, but they want to avoid labor costs and shift the expenses of running a business to their workers. They can\u2019t do both.\u201d\n\nThe Journal also reports that Shyp just publicly announced plans to count its couriers as employees, and that \u201cthe shift wasn\u2019t made in response to the lawsuits against on-demand app companies.\u201d\n\nSign-up for our newsletters Sign Up Daily Weekly", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanks to one Boston-based lawyer.", "og": {"url": "https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/ride-service-delivery-apps-lawsuits-employees-contractors", "image": "https://nextcity.org/images/daily/_resized/POSTMATES.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Thanks to one Boston-based lawyer.", "title": "Lawsuits Stack Up in Employee vs. Contractor Battle of Summon-by-App Economy"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nextcity.org", "description": "Thanks to one Boston-based lawyer.", "creator": "@NextCityOrg", "image": {"src": "https://nextcity.org/images/daily/_resized/POSTMATES.jpg"}, "title": "Lawsuits Stack Up in Employee vs. Contractor Battle of Summon-by-App Economy", "site": "@NextCityOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 310796842303514}, "thumbnail": "https://nextcity.org/images/daily/_resized/POSTMATES.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The lawyer behind lawsuits against Uber and Lyft over whether drivers should be considered employees or independent contractors is taking on similar companies.\n\u201cThe companies are setting rules and guidelines and threatening termination when the workers don\u2019t follow those rules,\u201d Liss-Riordan told the Journal.\nThe Boston Business Journal reports:Liss-Riordan\u2019s clients \u2026 claim that these companies exercise the same control over their workers, particularly those involved in delivery, as [Uber].\nThe California Labor Commission ruled last month that San Francisco-based Uber driver Barbara Ann Berwick is an employee of the ride-service giant.\nUber is appealing; classifying drivers as independent contractors is central to its (booming) business model."}
