It\u2019s a question that apparel retail company boards seem to be asking themselves with increased frequency these days. The answer, however, is anything but simple. Both types of ownership have their fans and detractors, as well as their benefits and disadvantages.\n\nGoing public is the tried and true way for founders and shareholders of rapidly growing privately-owned brands and retailers to cash in on their creativity, foresight and hard work. The promise of the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is what keeps many an entrepreneur working day and night to be the next Sam Walton, Steve Jobs or Jeff Bezos. Michael Kors, for example, made hundreds of millions when his company went public in 2011.\n\nMany retailers use the money raised in equity markets to finance growth by investing in technology, by acquiring other businesses, or by building new brick-and-mortar stores. Large retail companies like Walmart, TJX, Costco, Macy\u2019s and others went public decades ago, when interest rates were much higher than they are now. Selling equity was the cheaper and simpler way to raise money, and retail market growth was healthy. It\u2019s safe to say that these companies would not be where they are today without being public.\n\nStaying private also has its advantages, however, and a successful private company can earn its owners plenty. Two years ago Spanx founder Sara Blakely, who still owns 100 percent of her underwear company, became, according to Forbes, the youngest self-made female billionaire at age 41.\n\nRobin Lewis, co-author of \u201cThe New Rules of Retail\u201d and editorial director of The Robin Report, feels quite strongly that most retailers should not be public companies. \u201cIt\u2019s been my belief for a long time,\u201d said Lewis, \u201cthat highly cyclical businesses like retailing\u2013that are dependent on rapid response, seasonal changes, quickly changing product, fashion trends and random consumer behavior\u2013should not be publicly held.\u201d\n\nLewis believes that chasing short-term goals might force management of some of even the best-run public companies to make the wrong decisions. \u201cOne of the biggest threats to sustainable growth in public companies,\u201d he said, \u201cis the tendency to focus on making the \u2018numbers\u2019 every quarter, and leadership\u2019s willingness to resort to short-term tactics that are most often deleterious to sustainable long term growth and the strategies required to achieve it \u2014 which are often opposite those for short-term numbers.\u201d\n\nGiven retail\u2019s current slow-growth, ultra-competitive environment plagued by sluggish consumer spending and declining store traffic, you\u2019d think more companies would see things Lewis\u2019s way. Such does not seem to be the case, however. Only 14 companies in the apparel, footwear and textile retail space made it to this year\u2019s Forbes Private Companies list of the more than 220 U.S.-based private companies with annual sales of at least $2 billion. By contrast, there are more than twice that number of publicly-traded retail companies with at least $2 billion in sales in the U.S.\n\nMichael Dart, partner in the private equity practice of consulting firm A.T. Kearney and co-author, with Lewis, of \u201cThe New Rules of Retail,\u201d says that\u2019s because \u201cgoing public is an efficient way to raise capital needed for growth, and a lucrative way for founders to monetize their equity and to diversify financially. It also forces some discipline into the company\u2019s business practices so that it can withstand Wall Street scrutiny.\u201d However, Dart agrees with his co-author Lewis that the cyclicality and seasonality of retail make being public a difficult proposition for some retail companies finding themselves under pressure to deliver topline growth.\n\nAccording to Allan Ellinger, co-founder and senior managing partner at consulting firm MMG, \u201cBeing public is a burden. Maintaining the staff to meet all the regulations, keep up the reporting, filings, communications with analysts requires a significant investment.\u201d Ellinger feels that the reasons behind a company\u2019s decision to be financed primarily through debt or equity usually revolve around company mission, corporate culture, and the overall health of the firm and its brands.\n\nMany privately-held companies, like New Jersey-based Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us, prefer to not have to incur the cost and hassle of constantly answering to Wall Street. The seller of toys, apparel and other children\u2019s products was the highest ranked retailer on the list, with $13.5 billion in sales last year, putting it in the number 21 spot overall for privately held companies. The retailer was founded in the late 70s, and spent many years as a publicly traded company. Eventually, however, with increasing pressure from Walmart and other big box stores who battled it out for seasonal toy market share, the company realized it was futile to try to convince Wall Street that Santa Claus only comes once a year.\n\nOther companies stay private to keep business in the family. Levi Strauss & Co. is the third largest privately-owned retail apparel company in the country, with $4.61 billion in sales, and one of the oldest and most quintessentially American brands in the world. The company exists for the benefit of both its customers and the many descendents of Levi Strauss, particularly those in the the Haas family, who own stock in the company. And Belk Stores, at $4 billion in sales and the largest privately held traditional department store in the country (also family run), prefers to defend itself against the likes of Macy\u2019s outside the spotlight of Wall Street.\n\nSome companies prefer to remain private because of owner personality. Fast-fashion specialty retailer Forever 21, owned by a Los Angeles based Asian-American family, did a reported $3.7 billion in sales last year. Although the company is quiet about its strategies, vendors and financials, it did announce its intention to double its store count in the next three years. Might they decide to do an IPO? Don\u2019t bet on it, since these owners seem to prefer operating under the radar.\n\nMMG\u2019s Ellinger points out that \u201cThe personality of the founder determines corporate culture. Often, how secretive or open he or she is plays a part in whether the company prefers to be public or private.\u201d\n\nOther companies stay private so they can maintain personal beliefs and values. Arts and crafts retailer Hobby Lobby was in the news a couple of weeks ago after the United States Supreme Court ruled that the owners of closely-held, profit-making corporations cannot be forced under the Affordable Care Act to provide their employees with certain kinds of contraceptives that offend their religious beliefs. For this reason, the Christian-owned company, whose mission statement contains religious references, will no doubt remain private for quite a long time.\n\nAn increasingly common event is when a struggling or undervalued retailer (that, ironically enough, probably made its founders lots of money when it went public) becomes acquired by private equity partners who subsequently use their financial and operational expertise to turn the business around.\n\nA.T. Kearney\u2019s Dart feels that in many cases, just getting the company away from the scrutiny of Wall Street is a first step toward rehabilitation. \u201cToo often,\u201d he said, \u201ca public company finds that the value of its brand and of its stock become linked in the echo chamber of the public domain. Taking an underperforming company out of the spotlight is a great way to give it breathing room to do what it must to turn things around.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if J.C. Penney might have been more successful in its turnaround effort if it had been a private company, Dart said, \u201cUnequivocally. The scrutiny that company was under on an almost daily basis put tremendous pressure on the transformation management was trying to achieve.\u201d\n\nThe Sports Authority, which was taken private in 2006 by two private equity firms, decided to pursue that path. It decided the best way it could navigate the increasingly competitive space occupied by Dick\u2019s, Cabela\u2019s and other high profile retailers was to get out from under Wall Street\u2019s microscope and execute its strategic and tactical plan as a privately held company.\n\nLuxury retailer Neiman-Marcus Group, operator of Neiman-Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, is the largest apparel retailer on the list, and occupies the 82nd spot overall for private U.S. companies. The company is now largely owned by Ares group, a private equity firm, and a large Canadian Pension fund.\n\nFabric and craft retailer Jo-Ann Stores was acquired by private equity firm Leonard Green in 2010 for $1.6 billion.\n\nMichaels Stores, its turnaround complete, went public just after the list went to press. Burlington Coat Factory, which was public until 2006 when it was acquired by Bain Capital, apparently appeared in the Forbes list by mistake, because it went public again last October.\n\nJ.Crew Group, with $2.4 billion in revenues last year, was omitted from the Forbes list even though it was famously taken private in 2006 by Leonard Green and has been rumored to be considering another IPO.\n\nWith interest rates at near zero, company management teams and employees can do leveraged buyouts using very cheap money. With so many retailers suffering from declining mall traffic, slowing sales and the need to invest in technology, we might see more companies going private in the near future.\n\nWhich retailers might we see on next year\u2019s list of big private companies? Beleaguered yogawear purveyor Lululemon and Baby Boomer fave Chico\u2019s are among the many about whom rumors are swirling.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say, however, that there will never be a definitive answer to the public/private question. As long as there\u2019s an opportunity to make a profit, both ownership types \u2014 and the practice of converting one to another \u2013 will continue.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Public or private?
