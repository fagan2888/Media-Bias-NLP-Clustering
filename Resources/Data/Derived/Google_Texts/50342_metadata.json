That plan, begun two years ago, now has 3,000 subscribers and will expand to five more counties--making six total--when Medicare enrollment begins Oct. 15.\n\nCarePoint also applied with the state to become a Medicaid provider. Fifty-eight percent of its ER patients, and 38 percent of hospitalized patients are covered by Medicaid, charity care or are uninsured.\n\nWith that in mind, CarePoint \"has been very deliberate about creating alternate sites of care,\" Kelly said, creating neighborhood health centers for each of its hospitals and setting up charity care clinics within the hospitals.\n\nBecause CarePoint does not participate in most commercial health insurance networks, patients can receive high out-of-network bills, an area under scrutiny in the New Jersey General Assembly.\n\nCompetition fostered by the Affordable Care Act favors non-profit health organizations, former Cigna exec and industry watchdog Wendell Potter told Managed Care, as previously reported by FierceHealthPayer. To survive, for-profits will have to diversify by operating outside the United States and expanding their business lines.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nInsurers and hospitals clash over out-of-pocket expenses\n\nHospital group rebranding expands health plan offerings\n\nFor-profit insurers will diversify into data market, industry watchdog predicts\n\nUS hospitals have highest administrative spending costs in the world", "article_metadata": {"description": "CarePoint Health's new CEO Dennis Kelly plans to further expand the business beyond its Hudson County, New Jersey roots while focusing on keeping patients healthy and better coordinating care.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "CarePoint Health's new CEO Dennis Kelly plans to further expand the business beyond its Hudson County, New Jersey roots while focusing on keeping patients healthy and better coordinating care.", "title": "Expanded services central to CarePoint Health's plans", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/expanded-services-central-carepoint-healths-plans/2014-10-09", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "care coordination,Medicaid,Medicare,Operations & Business Management,preventive care", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "CarePoint Health's new CEO Dennis Kelly plans to further expand the business beyond its Hudson County, New Jersey, roots while focusing on keeping patients healthy and better coordinating care.\nLast year CarePoint invested $45 million in the system, including equipment and technology, and expanded physician practices and its surgical practice group.\nFifty-eight percent of its ER patients, and 38 percent of hospitalized patients are covered by Medicaid, charity care or are uninsured.\nBecause CarePoint does not participate in most commercial health insurance networks, patients can receive high out-of-network bills, an area under scrutiny in the New Jersey General Assembly.\nTo survive, for-profits will have to diversify by operating outside the United States and expanding their business lines."}
