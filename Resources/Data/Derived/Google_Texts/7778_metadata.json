Eligible taxpayers receive advanced payments of the premium tax credit, which are then paid directly to their insurance company to lower premiums.\n\nTIGTA\u2019s review of the IRS\u2019s response to 101,018 income and family size verification requests between October 1 and October 4, 2013, showed that the agency provided accurate responses for 100,985 (99.7 percent) of the 101,018 requests, based on information provided by the health insurance exchange, according to the report, which was released to the public on August 5.\n\nHowever, TIGTA identified 33 requests for which the IRS incorrectly notified the exchange that it could not provide requested tax information for individuals because the IRS was unable to match the name on the application to IRS data records.\n\nThese responses were incorrect because the individual\u2019s name used on the application was in fact available in IRS data records, according to the report. This resulted from a programming error in which IRS data did not always contain the most recent name information showing on the individual\u2019s tax account.\n\nTrending {{item['sft-title']}}\n\nWhile the IRS estimated that this error affects roughly 2.8 million taxpayers for which information is contained in the coverage data repository (CDR), the IRS\u2019s main data repository for Affordable Care Act initiatives, the number of income and family size verification information requests received by the agency that are affected by the inaccurate CDR information is likely significantly less, according to TIGTA.\n\n\u201cNot all individuals with tax information in the CDR are eligible to use the exchange, and not all individuals who are eligible will use the exchange to purchase insurance,\u201d the report stated. \u201cThe IRS indicated it has requested changes be made to the computer programming to correct the name control error for the next exchange enrollment period in November 2014.\u201d\n\nThe report also found that the IRS accurately calculated the maximum month advanced premium tax credit for 120,824 requests received between October 1 and October 14, 2013.\n\n\u201cIn nearly all instances, the IRS correctly provided accurate information to the health exchanges on income and family sizes,\u201d J. Russell George, Treasury inspector general for tax administration, said in a written statement. \u201cAccurate information is essential for an exchange to determine if an applicant is eligible to obtain insurance coverage through the exchange.\u201d\n\nTIGTA recommended that the IRS\u2019s chief technology officer (CTO) ensure that IRS data records used to provide responses to exchange requests accurately reflect an individual\u2019s most recent name information contained in IRS data.\n\nThe IRS agreed with TIGTA\u2019s recommendation and stated that it has already implemented programming modifications so that name information fields are now consistent with the most recent name information on the individual\u2019s tax account.\n\n\u201cI am committed to continuously improving IRS IT systems and processes, and the Affordable Care Act Program Management Office has already taken steps to correct the few discrepancies identified in your report,\u201d IRS CTO Terence Milholland wrote in a response to TIGTA\u2019s findings. \u201cI am also pleased to say that with the perseverance and commitment of our team, the corrective action specified within this audit has been corrected and completed.\u201d\n\nRelated article:\n\nIRS: Assess Changes Now That May Affect Your Premium Tax Credit", "article_metadata": {"foaf": {"name": "Jason Bramwell"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "dcterms.title": "IRS Gets Pat on the Back for Accurate ACA Eligibility Data", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "IRS"}}, "og": {"site_name": "AccountingWEB", "title": "IRS Gets Pat on the Back for Accurate ACA Eligibility Data", "url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/irs/irs-gets-pat-on-the-back-for-accurate-aca-eligibility-data", "image": "http://www.accountingweb.com/sites/default/files/styles/media_medium/public/default-16x9.jpg?itok=FWa8WdE3", "updated_time": "2014-08-06T18:16:27+00:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/irs/irs-gets-pat-on-the-back-for-accurate-aca-eligibility-data", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS Gets Pat on the Back for Accurate ACA Eligibility Data"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#dce6eb", "dcterms.identifier": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/irs/irs-gets-pat-on-the-back-for-accurate-aca-eligibility-data", "dcterms.creator": "Jason Bramwell", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-06T18:16+00:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/awus/favicon-152.png", "dcterms.type": "Text", "sift": {"targeting": "[{\"key\":\"tag\",\"value\":[\"TIGTA\",\"Government\"]},{\"key\":\"type\",\"value\":\"Article\"},{\"key\":\"subtopic\",\"value\":\"IRS\"},{\"key\":\"topic\",\"value\":[\"IRS\",\"Tax\"]},{\"key\":\"url\",\"value\":\"node_18631\"},{\"key\":\"status\",\"value\":\"live\"},{\"key\":\"homepage\",\"value\":\"0\"},{\"key\":\"user\",\"value\":\"out\"},{\"key\":\"CxSegments\",\"value\":\"\"}]"}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-06T20:16:27+01:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-06T20:20:53+01:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "cXenseParse": {"sft-section": "IRS", "sft-tag": "TIGTA", "sft-date": "Aug 6th 2014", "sft-topic": "Tax", "sft-type": "Article", "recs": {"category": "Article", "articleid": "node-18631", "publishtime": "2014-08-06T20:16:27:000Z"}, "sft-author": "Jason Bramwell", "sft-title": "IRS Gets Pat on the Back for Accurate ACA..."}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc99d6\"", "article_summary": "This resulted from a programming error in which IRS data did not always contain the most recent name information showing on the individual\u2019s tax account.\nThese responses were incorrect because the individual\u2019s name used on the application was in fact available in IRS data records, according to the report.\nHowever, TIGTA identified 33 requests for which the IRS incorrectly notified the exchange that it could not provide requested tax information for individuals because the IRS was unable to match the name on the application to IRS data records.\n\u201cI am committed to continuously improving IRS IT systems and processes, and the Affordable Care Act Program Management Office has already taken steps to correct the few discrepancies identified in your report,\u201d IRS CTO Terence Milholland wrote in a response to TIGTA\u2019s findings.\n\u201cAccurate information is essential for an exchange to determine if an applicant is eligible to obtain insurance coverage through the exchange.\u201dTIGTA recommended that the IRS\u2019s chief technology officer (CTO) ensure that IRS data records used to provide responses to exchange requests accurately reflect an individual\u2019s most recent name information contained in IRS data."}
