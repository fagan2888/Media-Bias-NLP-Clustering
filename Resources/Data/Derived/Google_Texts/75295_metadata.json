Gary Peters, who has a 100% pro-abortion voting record in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nTerri Lynn Land opposes using taxpayer dollars to pay for elective abortion, and she supports the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act \u2013 groundbreaking legislation to protect unborn children from abortion after 20 weeks, when they are capable of feeling excruciating pain during abortions.\n\nGary Peters voted against the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R.1797, Roll Call No. 251, 6/18/13). Peters also voted to allow taxpayer funding of elective abortion (H.R.7, Roll Call No. 30, 1/28/14).\n\nGary Peters\u2019s pro-abortion position is so extreme that he is a co-sponsor of H.R. 3471, which National Right to Life has referred to as the \u201cAbortion Without Limits Until Birth Act.\u201d This extreme bill, if enacted, would invalidate nearly all state and federal limitations on abortion, including laws that protect individuals and private hospitals from being compelled to provide or participate in abortions.\n\nGary Peters voted to enact Obamacare, which provides government funding for health plans that pay for abortion on demand, and will result in the rationing of lifesaving medical treatments. Terri Lynn Land is needed in the U.S. Senate to help reverse the abortion-expanding and healthcare rationing effects of that law.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Terri Lynn Land Gets Pro-Life Endorsement to Face Pro-Abortion Gary Peters in Michigan", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "The National Right to Life Committee, the oldest and largest pro-life group in the nation, today endorsed Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land in her cam", "title": "Terri Lynn Land Gets Pro-Life Endorsement to Face Pro-Abortion Gary Peters in Michigan", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2014/09/04/terri-lynn-land-gets-pro-life-endorsement-to-face-pro-abortion-gary-peters-in-michigan/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/terrilynnland.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "keywords": "terri lynn land gets pro-life endorsement to face pro-abortion gary peters in michigan", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf96\"", "article_summary": "Terri Lynn Land is needed in the U.S. Senate to help reverse the abortion-expanding and healthcare rationing effects of that law.\nGary Peters\u2019s pro-abortion position is so extreme that he is a co-sponsor of H.R.\nThe National Right to Life Committee, the oldest and largest pro-life group in the nation, today endorsed Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land in her campaign for United States Senate.\nGary Peters voted against the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R.1797, Roll Call No.\nGary Peters voted to enact Obamacare, which provides government funding for health plans that pay for abortion on demand, and will result in the rationing of lifesaving medical treatments."}
