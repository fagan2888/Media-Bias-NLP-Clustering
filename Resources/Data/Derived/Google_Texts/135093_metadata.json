Organizer and Fort Smith attorney Joey McCutchen said the local group will be modeled after one established in Boone County in 2010.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just getting started,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cIt\u2019s about how we as citizens can be informed and then take action.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s stated mission is \u201cto ensure maximum transparency and openness in governmental affairs involving taxpayer monies and encourage full reporting of governmental activities by all available news media.\u201d\n\nAt the heart of the Transparency in Government Group is the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act.\n\n\u201cIt is the people\u2019s law, and it\u2019s a great equalizer,\u201d McCutchen said. \u201cThe reason I\u2019m so passionate about this is it\u2019s just like a jury trial. The smallest among us can compete with the largest corporation when we are in that courtroom and we have 12 of our peers evaluating it.\u201d\n\nSpeakers were Bill Ray Lewis and retired Lt. Col. Jim Parsons, both described by the group as experts in freedom of information laws.\n\nA member of the Boone County Transparency in Government Group, Lewis is a retired school administrator from Harrison. He encouraged Thursday night\u2019s attendees to get involved.\n\n\u201cAll you need as a group is to learn the law and how to apply it,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we want our governmental people to do is abide by the law. We\u2019re just after the truth. Where are the tax dollars going? Who\u2019s spending those tax dollars? What\u2019s the school superintendent make every year?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our right to know that.\u201d\n\nLewis spent much of his speaking time on the Arkansas FOIA, which he described as \u201cone of the greatest laws, I think, ever written in the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe call the FOIA the Sunshine Law,\u201d Lewis said, \u201cbecause it kind of lets sunshine in. We\u2019re looking through the telescope, which is sort of the FOIA law. It\u2019s magnifying what\u2019s going on in this city council meeting, this school board meeting or this quorum court meeting.\u201d\n\nMcCutchen said Transparency in Government Group of Western Arkansas will likely meet monthly or quarterly.
