The number of children showing up to school with their required shots is dropping according to the Florida Department of Health.

New data sent to the state's 67 school districts on Friday showed that nearly 93 percent of kindergarten students and 90.6 percent of seventh-graders had their required immunizations this year. The department stated that's the lowest vaccination level in a decade.

Florida law requires school children to get immunized in order to attend school although the law allows some exemptions.

In its memo the department advised that school districts should not admit any students from other states or countries if they don't have a valid immunization record. Students who move from one county to another in Florida may be given 30 days to provide proper documentation.
