She stood straight, head held high, to make the bulge less apparent. Nothing worked.\n\nBy middle age, Gallagher, 51, the owner of a pet-sitting business in Torrance, California, was avoiding mirrors and considering liposuction, but she worried about the effects of anesthesia and the recovery time. Then she discovered another option: a series of fat-reducing injections intended to slim down a double chin.\n\nShe enrolled in a trial, and by the third treatment session, \u201cI noticed a dramatic difference,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was receding.\u201d\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved the injection, called Kybella, for the reduction of moderate to severe fat deposits under the chin. The active ingredient, deoxycholic acid, dissolves fat, permitting dermatologists and plastic surgeons to resculpt the chin area without surgery.\n\n\u201cFor highly selected patients who have under-chin fat without sagging skin, this will work,\u201d said Dr. Rod J. Rohrich, a professor of plastic surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. He was not involved in clinical trials.\n\nTiny needles containing deoxycholic acid \u2014 up to 50 per session \u2014 are inserted into the fat deposits under the jawline. Treatment entails two to six monthly sessions of roughly 20 minutes each. Patients must commit to multiple visits.\n\nIn studies conducted for FDA approval, the most commonly reported side effects were bruising, pain and swelling. Dr. Derek H. Jones, a dermatologist and a principal investigator in a trial of the drug\u2019s effectiveness, found that people with the most fat had the most swelling. It usually cleared up in 48 to 72 hours.\n\n\u201cThat makes sense, because you\u2019re destroying more fat cells,\u201d said Jones, a paid consultant who will teach injectors and who treated Gallagher. In his experience, the first treatment was the most painful.\n\nThe injections will be commercially available in late summer, after doctors are trained. The price is not yet set.\n\nNot every patient is a good candidate for this treatment, several experts said. If a patient has excess fat and loose skin, Rohrich said, \u201cyou\u2019ll have a crepey neck and need a neck lift\u201d after fat is reduced with the shot. Neck lifts can cost $5,000 or more.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/05/hfwell19.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca3ad\"", "article_summary": "She enrolled in a trial, and by the third treatment session, \u201cI noticed a dramatic difference,\u201d she said.\nThen she discovered another option: a series of fat-reducing injections intended to slim down a double chin.\nIf a patient has excess fat and loose skin, Rohrich said, \u201cyou\u2019ll have a crepey neck and need a neck lift\u201d after fat is reduced with the shot.\n\u201cI was cute as button \u2014 and there was my double chin,\u201d she said.\nThe active ingredient, deoxycholic acid, dissolves fat, permitting dermatologists and plastic surgeons to resculpt the chin area without surgery."}
