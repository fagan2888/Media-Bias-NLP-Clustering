We\u2019re looking at tuition dollars, so the budget goes under a very intense budget analysis so they are appropriated the dollars needed to support their program,\u201d she said. \u201cSo a program not meeting enrollment expectations is likely using university resources that haven\u2019t been budgeted for it.\u201d\n\nBy the same token, submitting a low-ball projection in order to make a program appear wildly popular also skews the budget, she said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be gamed,\u201d she recently told a regents committee. \u201cWe don\u2019t want institutions to start giving us really low enrollment numbers. ... I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re gaming us, but the purpose of this is to ... financially plan for programs.\u201d\n\nSome schools missed the mark more than others.\n\nBetween 2004-2014, Georgia Southern University had accurate projections for nine of 10 programs while Georgia Regents University was right only six out of 17 times. The University of Georgia met the goal 12 of its 46 estimates.\n\nJoyce told the committee this is still a new process for the schools and some of the data is missing from the earliest programs.\n\n\u201cFrom a big-picture standpoint, I think we\u2019re doing quite well,\u201d she said.\n\nEvery month, the regents have programs to approve, such as this month\u2019s requests from Kennesaw State University to establish a Ph.D. majoring in analytics and data science, and UGA\u2019s plan for a master of science with a major in soil, water and environmental sciences. Each comes with a two-page summary, list of other schools in the system offering the same degree and an enrollment projection. In this case, UGA forecast six students enrolled by its third year.\n\nIndeed, some of these programs are small and specialized. A GRU program for a Ph.D. in biostatistics was projected to have nine students by its third year when it began in 2008, but it only had seven. Now it has 10.\n\nOn the other hand, a Ph.D. in physical therapy was expected to draw 36, but wound up with 247. Now, however, it has 90. The same program at Armstrong State University was slated to have 60 students by its third year and garnered 59 by then, but it has 80 today.\n\nOften, a popular major will be split into specialties, which should make forecasting easier.\n\nBefore a university makes a request, it has to do its homework and supply ample justification to the University System staff, according to Houston Davis, the system\u2019s chief academic officer.\n\n\u201cThe little bit of information you see is only part of the mound of information we look at,\u201d he told the regents.\n\nOf course, not all of the programs are graduate level. A bachelor of arts majoring in gender and women\u2019s studies at Armstrong drew just eight of the projected 25 students by its third year and only 13 now.\n\nAt Savannah State University, the masters of business administration has come up well short of its goal, but the bachelors\u2019 degrees in behavior analysis and in homeland security both exceeded their targets.\n\nSavannah State President Cheryl Dozier said television shows helped popularize the security course. Others need to be showcased.\n\nTwo factors complicate projections \u2011 faculty and students.\n\n\u201cMajors change rapidly among the students. They come in with one major, and they change their major,\u201d she said \u201c... It\u2019s very difficult to project that.\u201d\n\nBesides the students, who are young and often don\u2019t know themselves what they will major in, there are the professors whose natural bias can also cloud estimates.\n\n\u201cYou have faculty, and everyone thinks that theirs is going to be the one that\u2019s tops,\u201d she said.\n\nThe University System intends to make regular reports on program enrollment and to use the data to fine tune future projections, and ultimately decisions. That frequently includes consolidating some, scrapping others or rejecting requests up front.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Athens News, Athens Georgia, Athens Banner Herald, Athens, Georgia, Georgia Bulldogs, Dawgs, Bulldogs, Music, UGA, newspaper, 30601, Clarke County, Madison, Oconee, Oglethorpe, Dogs, 30602, 30603, 30604, 30605, Richt, SEC football, Jackson County, R.E.M., Widespread Panic, B-52s, Local News, Walter C.
