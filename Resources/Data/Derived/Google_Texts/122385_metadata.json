A justice should remain \u201cas long as she can do the job full steam,\u201d according to Ginsburg. \u201cAt my age, you take it year by year. I\u2019m OK this year.\u201d\n\nGinsburg also cited Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, both liberal justices who retired under President George H.W. Bush. Yet, while Bush\u2019s selection of the moderately liberal Justice David Souter to replace Brennan only moved the Court marginally to the right, his decision to replace America\u2019s most significant civil rights attorney with the staunchly conservative Justice Clarence Thomas may be the most consequential Supreme Court appointment since Chief Justice Earl Warren joined the bench in 1953.\n\nMarshall was in poor health when he left the Court, but he survived until a few days after President Clinton took the oath of office. Had Clinton selected Marshall\u2019s replacement instead of Bush, the Citizens United case would have been an obvious loser that likely never would have been filed. There would likely be five votes on the Supreme Court to abolish voter ID laws. Practices like forced arbitration, which cause consumers and workers to sign away their right to sue businesses in a real court, would be far less widespread and likely would not exist at all in employment contracts. A 1992 Supreme Court decision significantly limiting the right to choose an abortion would have come down the other way \u2014 and Roe v. Wade would likely have five solid votes on the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act \u2014 all of it \u2014 would still be good law.\n\nIf a future Republican president has the opportunity to replace Justice Ginsburg, the results could be no less consequential. Here\u2019s a short list of decisions that would immediately become vulnerable if Ginsburg\u2019s vote went to a conservative justice:\n\nThis list, of course, is only a small sample of the things that could happen if Ginsburg is replaced by a conservative. A full list would be much, much longer.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Justice Ginsburg indicated Tuesday that she does not intend to retire soon.
