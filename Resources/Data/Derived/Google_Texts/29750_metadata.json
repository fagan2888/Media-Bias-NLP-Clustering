(Photo: Paul Kieu, The Advertiser)Buy Photo\n\nNEW IBERIA \u2014 At 38, Parker Templeton has already landed his dream job.\n\nIn the 18 months since he assumed the roles of president and CEO of Iberia Medical Center, the hospital has been recognized for excellence in patient care, for patient experience for women, as a top hospital in Louisiana and made the annual list of \u201c100 SafeCare Hospitals.\u201d\n\nTempleton himself has earned recognition in Becker\u2019s Hospital Review, which named him a \u201cRising Star\u201d in hospital administration, the only Louisianian on the list.\n\nNo small achievements, but no great surprises, either, from a health care administrator who has worked his way up from graduation at LSU \u2014 he studied accounting, then made a quick change in majors to cardiopulmonary science at LSU Health Science Center. After he earned a master\u2019s degree in healthcare administration from Trinity University and served as an assistant administrator at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas and St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in Decatur, Illinois, he returned to his native Louisiana, where he served as CEO at the 22-bed Franklin Foundation Hospital in St. Mary Parish.\n\nSo what\u2019s next on the list for this rapid riser in the health care field? More of the same.\n\nTempleton has earned the Rising Young Business Leader award from the Junior Achivement of Acadiana Business Hall of Fame 2015. He\u2019ll receive his award May 6 in an event at The Victorian in Broussard.\n\nBorn in Pensacola, Florida, Templeton\u2019s family moved to his mother\u2019s hometown of New Iberia at age 5, where he grew up and graduated Catholic High. New Iberia is home: \u201cPart of my passion is being from New Iberia,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have the privilege of leading an organization that provides caring and compassion to New Iberians,\u201d he said. \u201cI interned here in the summer. I spent time in the ER.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another reason why he feels he has set roots in his hometown: He and his wife, who is a hospital administrator in Lafayette, are giving the same environment and quality of life to their children that he relished while growing up.\n\nTempleton\u2019s goal of being a hospital administrator was set early in college. He set out to study accounting \u2014 his dad is an accountant \u2014 but quickly realized that accounting did not provide him with the excitement he wanted in a job. He changed majors to gain more clinical knowledge of health care \u2014 that would enable him to have more intelligent conversations with physicians and staff, he said \u2014 but the goal was always health care administration.\n\nThe excitement of the job rests in its business complexity, he said, as well as in its service to others. Health care \u201cdrivers\u201d include the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid reimbursement, challenges that must be met to keep hospital doors open and staff \u2014 he has about 500 employees at the 99-bed IMC \u2014 working.\n\nAlong the way, he said, he served under great mentors and developed a simple philosophy: Put the patient first.\n\nAlthough he said IMC will push past 100 beds \u2014 there are financial advantages to breaking 100 \u2014 he said patient care itself is shifting from keeping patients at the hospital to keeping people \u201cout of the hospital.\u201d The old model of financial success used to be a full parking lot, he said. Someday, it may be measured by how few patients need in-hospital care.\n\nMeanwhile, IMC continues to serve the community with myriad services. There are no heart surgeries or transplants, but the hospital delivered 600 babies last year and sees 36,000 patients a year in the Emergency Room. There are state-of-the-art surgical suites and top-notch labs.\n\nHe was fortunate, he said, to inherit a hospital that was already in good shape and has a board of commissioners with a \u201cproper vision\u201d for the future.\n\nSo why would he ever leave, he said, as long as he and the board believe he is doing good work?\n\nHe\u2019ll continue a focus on recruiting and retaining good employees \u2014 \u201cWe have an exceptionally strong medical staff here,\u201d he said \u2014 and keeping those good employees happy. Strategy, operations and people are what makes good leaders, and most important among these is people.\n\n\u201cIf we as leaders are caring and supportive of our workers, they will care for our patients,\u201d he said.\n\nGood performance is rewarded, he said. Thank-you notes from patients are saved and treasured, he said, because \u201cwhat gets rewarded gets repeated.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing a good job,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is where I want to be.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a privilege to work here every day.\u201d\n\nIberia Medical Center, by the numbers\n\n\u2022Beds: 99\n\n\u2022Emergency Room visits: 36,000 a year\n\n\u2022Employees: 500\n\n\u2022Medical staff: More than 100\n\nSource: Parker Templeton, president and CEO\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/money/business/2015/04/04/young-leader-privilege-every-day/25263849/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "So what\u2019s next on the list for this rapid riser in the health care field?
