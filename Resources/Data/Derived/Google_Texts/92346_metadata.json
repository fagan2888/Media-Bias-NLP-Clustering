The crowd were wonderful and lifted me for my sprint finish.\u201d\n\nIn a tight finale, Kipchoge broke clear of Kipsang in the final 800 meters before waving and pointing at the crowd in front of Buckingham Palace as he finished five seconds in front of his compatriot.\n\nKipsang still holds the course record of 2:04.29, which he set last year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind the cold weather,\u201d Kipsang said. \u201cThe crowd kept me going, it was a wonderful atmosphere.\u201d\n\nKipchoge and Kipsang were followed home in the 35th annual race by Dennis Kimetto and Stanley Biwott.\n\nBut while Kenya dominated the men\u2019s race, a four-year winning streak for the East African nation ended in the women\u2019s event. Tigist Tufa became only the second Ethiopian woman to win in London, emulating Derartu Tulu\u2019s triumph in 2001.\n\nThe 28-year-old Tufa won her first major marathon in 2 hours, 23 minutes, 22 seconds, with two-time winner Mary Keitany of Kenya 18 seconds adrift. Tufa\u2019s compatriot, Tirfi Tsegaye, was third.\n\n\u201cThe weather was very difficult for me and I found it a very slow race until the end and I was pushed,\u201d Tufa said. \u201cI was unwell at the end but I am very happy that I am OK now. I\u2019ve always dreamed about winning the London Marathon.\u201d\n\nRunning with the masses rather than the elite field was three-time winner Paula Radcliffe. The world record holder completed what could be her final marathon in an unofficial time of 2:36.55. It was within the IAAF qualifying requirements for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games, but Radcliffe has ruled out a final shot at winning an Olympic medal.\n\nRadcliffe, who set the world record of 2:15:25 in London in 2003, wanted to use Sunday\u2019s race to say farewell.\n\n\u201cI went off way too fast. From then on it got more and more emotional,\u201d the 41-year-old Radcliffe said. \u201cThere was a big sign at Embankment saying \u2018We will miss you\u2019, but it won\u2019t be as much as I will miss you.\n\n\u201cIt was so loud, my ears were ringing. It was just amazing the whole way round. All the way along, there were so many people giving me encouragement.\u201d\n\nBritain\u2019s Prince Harry presented medals to the winners of the men\u2019s and women\u2019s races, and also gave a lifetime achievement award to Radcliffe.\n\nThe wheelchair races were swept by Americans, with Tatyana McFadden winning for the third successive year in London and Joshua George capturing the men\u2019s title for the first time.\n\nDavid and Victoria Beckham cheered on their 12-year-old son Romeo, who completed the children\u2019s marathon which took place over the final five kilometers (three miles) of the full course.\n\nCelebrity runners included Formula One driver Jenson Button, who finished with a personal best of 2:52:30. Button said running a marathon was \u201ca lot more painful\u201d than motor racing.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Eliud Kipchoge wins 2015 London Marathon; Tigist Tufa wins women\u2019s race", "title": "Eliud Kipchoge wins 2015 London Marathon; Tigist Tufa wins women\u2019s race", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/04/26/eliud-kipchoge-wins-2015-london-marathon-tigist-tufa-wins-womens-race/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150426__6fe7b50badcbc412740f6a7067004f94p1.jpg", "height": 494}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150426__6fe7b50badcbc412740f6a7067004f94p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-26T11:28:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T19:27:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Running"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0b3a\"", "article_summary": "LONDON \u2014 Eliud Kipchoge won the London Marathon for the first time on Sunday, leading home a Kenyan top four ahead of defending champion Wilson Kipsang.\nThe world record holder completed what could be her final marathon in an unofficial time of 2:36.55.\nThe 28-year-old Tufa won her first major marathon in 2 hours, 23 minutes, 22 seconds, with two-time winner Mary Keitany of Kenya 18 seconds adrift.\n\u201cIt was a tough race,\u201d said the 30-year-old Kipchoge, who won the Chicago and Rotterdam marathons last year.\nRadcliffe, who set the world record of 2:15:25 in London in 2003, wanted to use Sunday\u2019s race to say farewell."}
