And, despite these benefits changes, the majority of employers (56 percent) expect 2016 healthcare costs to increase. This is according to the new Wells Fargo Insurance 2015 Employee Benefits Trends Survey.\n\nThe survey provides a glimpse into how employers of all sizes are addressing rising healthcare costs and new healthcare reform requirements.\n\nCadillac Tax, Controlling Costs, and Employee Retention\n\nAccording to the Wells Fargo Insurance survey, costs, productivity, and maintaining current benefits are top priorities for employers, with a focus on attracting and retaining employee. For small employers (fewer than 50 employees), retaining current employees was even more critical, with 94 percent saying it was a top priority.\n\n\n\nPreparing for the upcoming \u201cCadillac Tax\u201d is also a top concern for the majority of employers. The survey found:\n\n52 percent of employers are concerned about excise tax exposure (the \u201cCadillac Tax\u201d) with their current plan design.\n\n58 percent of employers expect their medical plan costs to exceed the thresholds for the excise tax in 2018.\n\nIn preparation for the Cadillac Tax (now delayed to 2020), the top three changes employers are planning include:\n\nIncreasing wellness initiatives to improve health of the population (51 percent).\n\nChanging employee Health Savings Account (HSA) contributions to post-tax (46 percent).\n\nReducing the value of the plan design (46 percent).\n\nSmall employers are also expected to make changes to employee benefit programs because of healthcare reform, although their strategies look a little different.\n\nAccording to the survey, smaller employers are controlling health benefit costs by:\n\nReducing health coverage to minimum essential levels (30 percent).\n\nMoving employees to public exchanges when available (19 percent).\n\nEliminating part-time employee or spousal coverage (14 percent each).\n\nConclusion\n\nFor the majority of employers in the United States, healthcare costs are on the rise. In anticipation of rising costs and the looming Cadillac tax, employers do not have a \u201cwait and see\u201d attitude. Instead, employers are making proactive changes with cost-control strategies and employee retention in mind. Do you agree with the findings of the survey?
