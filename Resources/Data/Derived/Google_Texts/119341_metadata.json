The Canadian Press obtained the report under the Access to Information Act.\n\n\u201cThe wages of middle income workers have stagnated,\u201d it says, referring to the period from 1993 to 2007.\n\n\u201cMiddle-income families are increasingly vulnerable to financial shocks.\u201d\n\nThe document, drawing on three years of \u201cinternal research,\u201d was prepared for the department\u2019s deputy minister, Ian Shugart, shortly before the resumption of Parliament last fall.\n\n\u201cIn Canada, political parties are making the middle class a central piece of their agendas,\u201d notes the presentation.\n\nA department spokesman, Jordan Sinclair, said in an e-mail that the research \u201cwas not linked to the parliamentary schedule or topics raised within the House of Commons.\u201d\n\nThe authors say middle-income families have seen their earnings rise by an average of only 1.7 per cent a year over the 15 years ending 2007.\n\n\u201cThe market does not reward middle-income families so well,\u201d says the report. \u201cAs a result, they get an increasingly smaller share of the earning\u2019s pie\u201d compared with higher-income families.\n\nShugart was also told middle-class workers \u201cget lesser government support for their work transitions,\u201d referring to a sharp fall-off in employment-insurance benefits compared with other economic groups.\n\nThe analysis stops short of the 2008 global recession, though other analysts have noted the economic crisis wiped out many well-paid manufacturing jobs in central Canada that have supported middle-class prosperity.\n\nThe report also refers to debt, saying \u201cmany in the middle spend more than they earn, mortgaging their future to sustain their current consumption.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver the medium term, middle-income Canadians are unlikely to move to higher income brackets, i.e., the \u2018Canadian dream\u2019 is a myth more than a reality.\u201d\n\nCurrent Conservative messaging emphasizes a million new jobs created since the recession; Canada\u2019s relative economic stability compared with other industrialized countries; and various tax cuts provided to \u201caverage\u201d families since 2006.\n\nA spokeswoman for Employment Minister Jason Kenney said the report reflects \u201cthe period of time under the previous Liberal government,\u201d from 1993 forward. (The report also covers 2006-2007, the first two years under the Harper Conservatives; the department says an updated report is \u201cnot available at this time.\u201d)\n\n\u201cOur government has reduced taxes and made life affordable for Canadian families,\u201d Alexandra Fortier said in an email Sunday, adding a \u201ctypical\u201d family of four enjoys tax cuts of $3,400 a year, thanks to Conservative policies.\n\nThat \u201ctypical\u201d family includes working parents who together earn $120,000 a year, with two children.\n\nThis month\u2019s budget acknowledged the need to create jobs and provide workplace training, but the budget documents never refer explicitly to the \u201cmiddle class.\u201d The term \u201cmiddle income\u201d occurs just three times in the main budget, and once in a news release.\n\nSince becoming Liberal leader in April last year, Justin Trudeau has frequently cited the plight of the middle class, a theme repeated at the party\u2019s weekend convention in Montreal.\n\nResearch from the Library of Parliament shows that since Jan. 1, 2013, Trudeau has used the phrase \u201cmiddle class\u201d 52 times in the House of Commons, compared with twice for Prime Minister Stephen Harper and nine times for NDP Leader Tom Mulcair. None of them used \u201cmiddle income.\u201d\n\nToronto Liberal MP Chrystia Freeland commended the public servants who produced the report, saying that for the Liberals \u201cit was like getting a good grade on your homework.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a very strong, non-partisan, data-driven report, focused on Canada, which confirms our assertion, which is at the centre of our policy, that the middle class in Canada is being squeezed and that we have to do something about it,\u201d she said in an interview from Montreal.\n\n\u201cThe public discourse has been lagging \u2013 we\u2019ve been in denial.\u201d\n\nFreeland, who won a November by-election and now is the party\u2019s trade critic, is author of the 2012 book Plutocrats, which argues that wealth distribution has favoured the ultra-rich and left everybody else behind.\n\nReport Typo/Error", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com", "application-artifactId": "gam-webapp", "application-version": "14.0.333", "description": "Internal Conservative government report provides unvarnished account of the plight of middle-income families", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=429228415", "og": {"site_name": "The Globe and Mail", "description": "Internal Conservative government report provides unvarnished account of the plight of middle-income families", "title": "Middle-class dreams a \u2018myth\u2019 in troubled economy: internal government report", "url": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/middle-class-dreams-a-myth-in-troubled-economy-internal-government-report/article17056573/", "image": {"width": 400, "secure_url": "https://sec.images.theglobeandmail.com/media/www/images/flag/gam-square.png", "type": "image/png", "identifier": "http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/53a/news/politics/article17056572.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/CPT500-Make+Believe+Family.JPG", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Internal Conservative government report provides unvarnished account of the plight of middle-income families", "creator": "@globeandmail", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tgam://article/17056573", "iphone": "tgam://article/17056573"}, "country": "CA", "name": {"ipad": "The Globe And Mail", "iphone": "The Globe And Mail"}, "id": {"ipad": 429228415, "iphone": 429228415}}, "site": "@globeandmail", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512948019}, "robots": "noarchive", "last-modified": "2014-02-23 04:15:48 EST", "fb": {"app_id": 126045934076200}, "location": "Canada", "application-contextName": "globeandmail", "keywords": "Jordan Sinclair;Ian Shugart;House of Commons;middle-income;families;report;government;middle;research;middle-income families;government report;Canadian dream;unvarnished account;Middle-class dreams;troubled economy;income workers;department spokesman;Canada;Tories;Conservatives;", "article": {"engagement": "true", "type": "news", "id": 17056573, "comments": "false", "pages": 1}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "identifier-URL": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3885\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIn Canada, political parties are making the middle class a central piece of their agendas,\u201d notes the presentation.\n\u201cThe market does not reward middle-income families so well,\u201d says the report.\n\u201cMiddle-income families are increasingly vulnerable to financial shocks.\u201dThe document, drawing on three years of \u201cinternal research,\u201d was prepared for the department\u2019s deputy minister, Ian Shugart, shortly before the resumption of Parliament last fall.\nSince becoming Liberal leader in April last year, Justin Trudeau has frequently cited the plight of the middle class, a theme repeated at the party\u2019s weekend convention in Montreal.\nThe Canadian Press obtained the report under the Access to Information Act."}
