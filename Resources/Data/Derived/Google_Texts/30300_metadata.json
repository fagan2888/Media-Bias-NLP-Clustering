Lamb was born six months after his grandfather died in 1990, having spent 26 years behind the mic.\n\n\u201cI was taking it all in and trying to embrace it,\u201d said Lamb, who lost 5-3. \u201cIt was definitely a surreal moment. I definitely felt like I was dreaming.\u201d\n\nAdrian Gonzalez spoiled Lamb\u2019s debut by hitting a three-run homer with two outs in the fifth inning that put the Dodgers ahead for good.\n\nLamb allowed five runs and eight hits in six innings. The 25-year-old left-hander from the Orange County city of Laguna Hills struck out seven and walked two.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got velocity, movement, deception, he\u2019s got a nice big overhand curveball and a real nice changeup. There\u2019s a lot to work with,\u201d Reds manager Bryan Price said. \u201cI thought he was extremely composed. It was a difficult environment in which to pitch in for a debut back at home.\u201d\n\nAlex Wood (8-7) earned his first victory in three tries with the Dodgers, allowing three runs and five hits in 6 1/3 innings. The left-hander struck out three and walked three while pitching at home for the first time since being acquired from Atlanta.\n\nKenley Jansen retired the side in the ninth for his 23rd save in 24 chances. He earned his 129th career save, tying Jeff Shaw for second all-time in franchise history.\n\nJoey Votto drove in all three of Cincinnati\u2019s runs, including a two-run homer that left the Reds trailing 5-3 in the sixth. After going 1 for 4 in the series opener Thursday, he was 2 for 4 with a run scored.\n\nVotto\u2019s RBI double in the first provided the Reds\u2019 only lead.\n\nJustin Turner\u2019s sacrifice fly tied the game 1-1 in the bottom of the first. His RBI single with two outs in the fifth put the Dodgers ahead for good, 2-1, in his second game back from a serious skin infection. Gonzalez followed with his homer.\n\nLamb wore Johnny Cueto\u2019s former No. 47 after the Reds sent Cueto to Kansas City last month for Lamb and two other left-handed prospects. Lamb took fellow rookie Michael Lorenzen\u2019s spot in the rotation after he was optioned to Triple-A Louisville on Thursday.\n\nLamb was the eighth rookie pitcher to start for the Reds this season, tying the modern club record. Rookies have started 16 straight games since July 28, the longest such streak since the first year of the rookie designation in 1958.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nDodgers: RHP Juan Nicasio went on the 15-day DL retroactive to Monday with a left abdominal strain, and RHP Carlos Frias was transferred to the 60-day DL with right lower back tightness. \u2026 RHP Chris Hatcher, who had a left oblique strain, came off the 60-day DL. \u2026 C Yasmani Grandal returned after missing a day with a sore left shoulder.\n\nMULITPLE HITS\n\nVotto had his National League-leading 40th multi-hit game while raising his batting average to .400 with nine doubles, six homers and 15 RBI in 27 games since the All-Star break.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nReds: LHP David Holmberg (1-1, 3.06 ERA) makes his fourth start of the season and his first career appearance against LA. In Monday\u2019s 2-1 loss at San Diego, he only allowed a two-run homer by Justin Upton.\n\nDodgers: LHP Brett Anderson (6-7, 3.43) leads the majors with a 66.1 ground-ball percentage, inducing 263 grounders this season.", "article_metadata": {"description": "John Lamb was waiting to make his major-league debut for the Cincinnati Reds when he spotted Vin Scully on the video board talking about him and his grandfather.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "John Lamb was waiting to make his major-league debut for the Cincinnati Reds when he spotted Vin Scully on the video board talking about him and his grandfather.", "title": "Reds lose to Dodgers 5-3 in John Lamb\u2019s big-league debut", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/aug/15/reds-lose-to-dodgers-5-3-in-john-lambs-big-league-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/15/003b5f5d88ab22247f0f6a7067004ba1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/08/15/003b5f5d88ab22247f0f6a7067004ba1.jpg", "description": "John Lamb was waiting to make his major-league debut for the Cincinnati Reds when he spotted Vin Scully on the video board talking about him and his grandfather.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Reds lose to Dodgers 5-3 in John Lamb\u2019s big-league debut"}, "Author": "BETH HARRIS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda0e\"", "article_summary": "Scully mentioned in his game preview that Lamb\u2019s grandfather John Ramsey used to be the Dodgers\u2019 public address announcer.\nJoey Votto drove in all three of Cincinnati\u2019s runs, including a two-run homer that left the Reds trailing 5-3 in the sixth.\nLamb was the eighth rookie pitcher to start for the Reds this season, tying the modern club record.\nDodgers: LHP Brett Anderson (6-7, 3.43) leads the majors with a 66.1 ground-ball percentage, inducing 263 grounders this season.\nI definitely felt like I was dreaming.\u201dAdrian Gonzalez spoiled Lamb\u2019s debut by hitting a three-run homer with two outs in the fifth inning that put the Dodgers ahead for good."}
