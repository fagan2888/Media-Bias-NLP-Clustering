Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) in the last few days concerned his role in forcing a delay on passage of the $1.1 trillion spending bill. He was slapped down on his \u201cpoint of order\u201d by a 74-22 vote, including 20 no votes from Republicans. With the government shutdown avoided for the balance of the fiscal year, the Republicans in 2015 will be able to vote to reverse, de-fund or otherwise try to hobble the president\u2019s immigration order without risking the government\u2019s closure. Hmm, sounds like the best place to be if you are a Republican.\n\nIn a scathing op-ed the conservative Washington Examiner editorial board wrote:\n\nCruz\u2019s and [Sen. Mike] Lee\u2019s parliamentary freelancing gave Reid all he needed to advance the schedule by two full days and guarantee the confirmation of these nominations. In exchange for making Reid\u2019s job easy on ramming the nominations through, all Cruz and Lee got was a symbolic floor vote against Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration. It drew the support of only 22 senators. One reason was that if it had succeeded, their motion would not have prevented Obama\u2019s executive action but, rather, would have killed the underlying omnibus bill and caused a government shutdown. . . . The weekend\u2019s events demonstrate that some Republicans are not playing on the same team. This was not a simple, common occurrence of senatorial independence, but rather open defiance of caucus strategy \u2014 a decision by junior officers that their own tactical decisions take precedence over those of generals who were chosen for the job.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) after his marathon speech against Obamacare. (J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press)\n\nWhat is more, those junior officers continually run themselves into a brick wall and give the other side political victories.\n\nCriticism of Cruz usually centers on this type of grandstanding at the expense of colleagues. But he also has a propensity to vote no on every piece of major legislation that involves any compromise for the hard right. Some refer to this as making the perfect the enemy of the good, such as when House Republicans under his spell voted against the \u201cPlan B\u201d to minimize the elimination of part of the Bush tax cuts; the end result was worse for Republicans.\n\nBut it also reflects a strange hierarchy of priorities. Consider his no vote, one of 11 senators and only six Republicans, on the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). He objected to inclusion of a provision critics called a federal land grab. Its defenders argued, \u201cThe new lands added to the federal wilderness register are part of a balanced agreement \u2013 a land swap that frees up current federal lands for resource development, providing new and needed domestic sources of oil, natural gas, coal, timber and key metals like copper.\u201d\n\nThis is the quintessential must-pass legislation that regrettably includes some non-germane items. The Hill explained:\n\nAs the House prepares to leave town Thursday night, the bill\u2019s authors made it clear it that this bill was the only chance to pass an NDAA authorization by the end of the year. \u201cWe have to pass this bill,\u201d Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) said ahead of the vote. \u201cThe House is going to go home and there are no ways to make any changes.\u201d Senators on both sides of the aisle defended the lands use portion, saying the Congressional Budget Office reported it would be deficit neutral. It designates new national parks and wilderness areas and expedites the permit process for oil and gas drilling, among other things. \u201cThat is why the package of lands bills in the National Defense Authorization Act is vitally important to America,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said. \u201cThis compromise is the chance for the Senate to get something done.\u201d Leaders of the House and Senate Armed Services committees worked for weeks to reach the deal by the end of the year \u2014 something every Congress for the last 52 years has done.\n\nAnd on this Cruz once again voted no. Is his concern for federal lands so great that it trumps national security? That is screwy, to be blunt, and suggests he subordinates the government\u2019s highest priority (national security), including some key items on the war against the Islamic State, to his fetish for fiscal purity. This is why, I suspect, he will never vote on any vehicle to lift the defense sequestration cuts. Gasp \u2014 that might require a compromise!\n\nNow perhaps he did not really want the NDAA to fail. (The benefit of being a minority of a minority is that you can make grand gestures because other responsible lawmakers do the right thing.) Perhaps he just wants to keep his gold stars, his \u201cperfect\u201d voting record with libertarian and far-right groups. That\u2019s not exactly a profile in courage, and it is no way to govern. In fact, it is the philosophy of anti-governance, because getting everything one wants and taking no lumps make legislating impossible. Consistently rejecting useful and conservative legislation because of small infirmities is not the behavior of a leader dedicated to accomplishing important things, and it suggests Cruz is grossly unsuited for the Senate, let alone higher office. Imagine if he ran a state \u2014 or the country \u2014 without super-majorities of Republicans. Things would be worse than they are now. Rigidity of mind and contempt for opponents in a president have resulted in paralysis and nastiness for six years, so why repeat the experience?\n\nAnd really, if Cruz could find some other way to get attention, get his face on TV and get money out of gullible hard-right voters, don\u2019t we think he\u2019d take it? The Senate is a personal platform for him, not a position to perform well in delivering the best possible results for Texans or Americans at large. Thank goodness voters found out early on that his fixation is with fame and not with tending to the real needs of the country.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When you never compromise, you never deliver.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "When you never compromise, you never deliver.", "title": "The art of (never) compromising", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/12/15/the-art-of-never-compromising/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/files/2013/09/cruz2.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2014/12/15/the-art-of-never-compromising/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "cruz and NDAA, cruz showboat, cruz personal ambition", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "cruz and NDAA, cruz showboat, cruz personal ambition"}, "article_summary": "Is his concern for federal lands so great that it trumps national security?\nHe was slapped down on his \u201cpoint of order\u201d by a 74-22 vote, including 20 no votes from Republicans.\nConsider his no vote, one of 11 senators and only six Republicans, on the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).\nin the last few days concerned his role in forcing a delay on passage of the $1.1 trillion spending bill.\nIt designates new national parks and wilderness areas and expedites the permit process for oil and gas drilling, among other things."}
