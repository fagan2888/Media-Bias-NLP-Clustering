The sale was dependent on rezoning the land to allow for what will be a boutique hospital \u2014 a hospital that specializes in personalized care and high-volume surgeries.\n\nFoothills Park and Recreation executive director Ron Hopp said he wasn\u2019t sure of the specifics of the hospital but had heard it would be a boutique hospital.\n\nEmerus is partnered with SCL Health System, which will build four of these smaller hospitals throughout the Denver metro area, according to a SCL news release. The boutique hospitals will offer emergency medical care, inpatient care, surgical procedures and other services. It will be staffed by board-certified physicians, experienced nurses and other specialists.\n\nHopp said the land will be sold for $1.165 million. The Jefferson County Commissioners approved the rezoning at their April 29 meeting and the developer will have to go through a site development plan process, according to Jeffco planner Analiese Hock.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to see vacant land that is being utilized to the highest and best use,\u201d District 3 Commissioner Don Rosier said.\n\nRosier noted that there wasn\u2019t any public comment against the hospital when the rezoning was approved. There will not be a public hearing along with the site development plan, but Hock said there would be public notification.\n\nThe parcel is one of six that Foothills Park and Recreation put up for sale as a result of two failed mill levies in 2006 and 2008. Hopp said this was land Foothills could spare.\n\n\u201cThese weren\u2019t parks, weren\u2019t ever going to be parks and didn\u2019t make sense to be parks,\u201d Hopp said. \u201cThere are also spaces available close by that are open space, so it\u2019s not a great loss for opportunities.\u201d\n\nHopp said this parcel and the two near South Simms Street and South Ward Street are sold or under contract. The two spots near Simms and Ward are under construction to become a housing development.\n\nTwo parcels at Wadsworth and Columbine Drive are still for sale and Foothills is in negotiations for the sixth parcel at the northeast corner of Wadsworth and Coal Mine. Hopp hopes the sales will generate approximately $4 million for the district.\n\nJoe Vaccarelli: 303-954-2396, jvaccarelli@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joe_vacc", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf63d\"", "article_summary": "A new small hospital is headed to south Jefferson County at the northwest corner of Wadsworth Boulevard and Coal Mine Avenue.\nThe sale was dependent on rezoning the land to allow for what will be a boutique hospital \u2014 a hospital that specializes in personalized care and high-volume surgeries.\nFoothills Park and Recreation executive director Ron Hopp said he wasn\u2019t sure of the specifics of the hospital but had heard it would be a boutique hospital.\nHopp said this was land Foothills could spare.\nRosier noted that there wasn\u2019t any public comment against the hospital when the rezoning was approved."}
