However, as KGTV in San Diego reported, Todd Fassler picked a rattlesnake out of the brush and thought he might memorialize the event.\n\nThe snake had other ideas and bit him.\n\nFassler was taken to hospital. His medical expenses could be described as expensive. KGTV's Dan Haggerty tweeted Fassler's bill -- for $153,161.25. Of this, more than $83,000 was for \"pharmacy.\" His case reportedly depleted the antivenom supplies at two local hospitals.\n\nWhile you might rail against the iniquities of the US medical system, I will continue to focus on the nonsense of taking selfies with animals who have a clear disinterest in having their picture taken.\n\nPlease don't do this. Yes, it's the summer and ros\u00e9 can go to your head.\n\nBut how many more examples does the world need of people believing that taking a selfie takes precedence over all other human activity and all other animal life?\n\nThere are other things you can do with your day, your hour, your minute. The 30 seconds of fame you think you'll get isn't worth, say, Todd Fassler's five-day hospital stay.\n\nYou have been warned.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Technically Incorrect: A man gets a $150,000 doctor's bill after a rattler decides a selfie just isn't his thing.", "og": {"site_name": "CNET", "description": "Technically Incorrect: A man gets a $150,000 doctor's bill after a rattler decides a selfie just isn't his thing.", "title": "Man tries selfie with rattlesnake, gets snakebit for $150,000", "url": "http://www.cnet.com/news/man-tries-selfie-with-rattlesnake-gets-snakebit-for-150000/", "image": "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/07/25/4ed24cfd-6211-4578-953d-2f2ccc25856f/thumbnail/670x503/2d38019630482ad121a67b6d20f84e32/rattlesnake-crop-getty.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Technically Incorrect: A man gets a $150,000 doctor's bill after a rattler decides a selfie just isn't his thing.", "title": "Man tries selfie with rattlesnake, gets snakebit for $150,000", "url": "http://www.cnet.com/news/man-tries-selfie-with-rattlesnake-gets-snakebit-for-150000/", "image": {"width": 670, "identifier": "https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/07/25/4ed24cfd-6211-4578-953d-2f2ccc25856f/thumbnail/670x503/2d38019630482ad121a67b6d20f84e32/rattlesnake-crop-getty.jpg", "height": 503}, "creator": "@ChrisMatyszczyk", "site": "@CNET", "card": "summary", "account_id": 30261067}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Product reviews and prices, software downloads, and tech news - CNET", "tp": {"baseUrl": "https://cnet2.cbsistatic.com/fly/bundles/cnetmpxpdk/pdk"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "http://www.cnet.com/news/man-tries-selfie-with-rattlesnake-gets-snakebit-for-150000/?search=toapp", "app_name": "CNET", "app_store_id": 383989837}}, "p": {"domain_verify": "47524839a64b83c951afca9ef6c838e0"}, "fb": {"admins": 100001036810388, "app_id": 16995676698}, "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "viewport": "width=device-width", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.cnet.com/", "fragment": "!", "google-site-verification": "wNWLoFvk5wsdZQ-u75uCNiaHNa7FLFmNtH2t7dZbXmQ", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnet"}, "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#424244", "msapplication-task": "name=Forums; action-uri=http://forums.cnet.com/; icon-uri=http://www.cnet.com/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1edb\"", "article_summary": "Recently, though, a San Diego man thought it might be an idea to take a selfie with a rattlesnake.\nEarlier this week, a Mississippi woman was attacked by a bison in Yellowstone National Park after trying to take a selfie with it.\nHowever, as KGTV in San Diego reported, Todd Fassler picked a rattlesnake out of the brush and thought he might memorialize the event.\nThe 30 seconds of fame you think you'll get isn't worth, say, Todd Fassler's five-day hospital stay.\nBut how many more examples does the world need of people believing that taking a selfie takes precedence over all other human activity and all other animal life?"}
