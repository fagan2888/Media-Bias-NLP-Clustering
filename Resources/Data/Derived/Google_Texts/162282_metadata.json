Health care providers cannot, however, update or alter records through the system.\n\nWhile significant, the announcement represents just one step in a long process that has infuriated political leaders and veterans throughout the country for years.\n\nThe two lumbering agencies have been trying since 1998 to integrate medical data so that VA health care providers can access and modify military records in the Pentagon\u2019s medical network.\n\nIn 2010, the departments created an interagency program office that spent an estimated $564 million on planning to create a joint electronic record before determining in 2013 that the VA should keep using its own system and the Pentagon should find a separate, commercial solution.\n\nRelated: Latest Outrage at the VA: Execs Profiting on Moving Expenses\n\nLast year the Pentagon selected Cerner to be its primary electronic health record provider in a deal that could be worth roughly $9 billion over its 18-year span. Meanwhile, the VA launched a modernization effort dubbed the VistA Evolution Program. Congress provided $182 million for the effort in fiscal 2015, though the upgrade\u2019s final price tag remains unknown.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s announcement is \u201ccertainly a step forward,\u201d according to Carlos Fuentes, senior legislative associate for the Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n\nWhile \u201cinteroperability is great\u201d because it helps smooth the transition for active duty service members from the Pentagon to the VA, \u201cultimately what would be best is if there was an integration of DOD and VA records,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, that remains a \u201cpipedream\u201d at the moment since the two bureaucracies decided to go their separate ways, according to Fuentes.\n\nRelated: Still Mired in Scandal, VA Awards $142 Million in Bonuses\n\nHe emphasized the importance of being able to share and update medical information both ways, which the new system cannot do. For instance, active duty members sometimes get moved to reserve status, thus making them eligible for VA health care, only to be put back on active status and moved back into the Pentagon\u2019s care.\n\nFuentes also noted that active military can receive mental health care at VA facilities that specialize in that kind of treatment.\n\nRep. Mark Takano (D-CA), a member of the House Veterans Affairs\u2019 Committee who regularly grills VA officials about the status of their IT projects, said he was \u201cpleased that VA and DOD have taken a significant step in the difficult process of connecting two complex health IT systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is natural to be skeptical given past delays and disappointments, but I\u2019m encouraged by today\u2019s news,\u201d he said in a statement to The Fiscal Times. \u201cThe electronic health systems used by our service members and veterans are critical to ensuring they receive the care they deserve. As DOD and VA continue to modernize their health IT systems, we must be vigilant that we are on course for meaningful interoperability.\u201d\n\nFuentes said another reason to remain vigilant going forward is because there\u2019s a larger conversation that needs to be had that includes the Health and Human Services Department, which in recent years has pushed providers in the Medicare system to convert to electronic medical records.\n\nAll three agencies should work together to \u201cleverage all of their systems\u201d to help integrate health data between public and private sector providers, he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Defense Department recently informed Congress it\u2019s finally reached a technical milestone that only took millions in wasted taxpayer dollars and years of constant berating from lawmakers to achieve: it can now share electronic health records with the Veterans Affairs Department.", "title": "The VA and Pentagon Take a Small \u2013 but Very Expensive \u2013 Step on Medical Records", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/21/VA-and-Pentagon-Take-Small-Very-Expensive-Step-Medical-Records", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02102014_Veterans_Affairs.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/21/VA-and-Pentagon-Take-Small-Very-Expensive-Step-Medical-Records", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02102014_Veterans_Affairs.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Defense Department recently informed Congress it\u2019s finally reached a technical milestone that only took millions in wasted taxpayer dollars and years of constant berating from lawmakers to achieve: it can now share electronic health records with the Veterans Affairs Department.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: The VA\u2019s Last, Best Chance to Salvage Its Health Care SystemThe agency\u2019s new Joint Legacy Viewer web-based software allows both military and VA health care providers to read health records from multiple sources.\nThe two lumbering agencies have been trying since 1998 to integrate medical data so that VA health care providers can access and modify military records in the Pentagon\u2019s medical network.\nHealth care providers cannot, however, update or alter records through the system.\nFuentes also noted that active military can receive mental health care at VA facilities that specialize in that kind of treatment.\nWhile \u201cinteroperability is great\u201d because it helps smooth the transition for active duty service members from the Pentagon to the VA, \u201cultimately what would be best is if there was an integration of DOD and VA records,\u201d he added."}
