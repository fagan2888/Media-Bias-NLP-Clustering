This is a growing problem, due to a very serious doctor shortage in the United States. Regrettably, for those Americans who lack sufficient access to doctors and medical care, legislation has been introduced in Congress that may make this situation worse.\n\nKnown as the \u201cThe Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act,\u201d the bill discriminates against American citizens who want to attend foreign medical schools, regardless of the quality of those institutions. Provisions in the legislation would prevent hopeful doctors in this country from securing affordable student aid to attend many foreign medical schools.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn reality, the only beneficiaries of the legislation would be one special interest group: medical schools in the United States. They are seeking to dominate the process by which Americans can become physicians, ignoring the severe physician shortage in this country.\n\nThe Congress\u2019 attempt to ensure that Americans who want to be doctors must train in the United States is shortsighted. This is because according to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) \u2013 an association representing medical schools in the United States -- the nation will face a shortage of between 46,000-90,000 physicians by 2025. According to their recent study: \u201cwithin the overall projected physician shortage, the study estimates a shortage of 12,000-31,000 primary care physicians.\u201d\n\nThe proposed law also fails to take into consideration an undeniable truth: there are not enough medical schools in the United States to train an adequate number of physicians needed to provide medical care. Many talented and hard working Americans who have the calling to go into medicine simply cannot get accepted into medical schools in their own country. To become doctors, those individuals have to go abroad.\n\nWhile there are some medical schools outside the United States that are sub-standard, there are many schools that do a very good job of educating hopeful American doctors. This legislation will make it harder for Americans to attend the top-tier foreign medical schools that do a very good job of preparing their students to practice medicine. This would mean fewer foreign trained doctors practicing medicine in the United States.\n\nIn Illinois, the home state of the bill\u2019s author, Sen. Richard Durbin Dick DurbinReid: 'Lay off' Sanders criticism Senators tout 4.5B defense spending bill that sticks to budget Lawmakers seek changes in TSA PreCheck program MORE (D), the doctor shortage is particularly severe. According to Kaiser Health News, in Illinois, between 25 and 29 percent of the population lives in an area with a primary care shortage. In Louisiana, the home state of Sen. Bill Cassidy (R), the bill\u2019s co-sponsor, more than 50 percent of people don't have enough access to primary care doctors.\n\nAccording to the AAMC, over 30 percent of practicing physicians in Illinois attended a foreign medical school and in Louisiana almost 20 percent of practicing physicians are foreign medical school graduates. In other words, without these doctors and the schools, the people of Illinois and Louisiana would suffer from an even worse doctor shortage.\n\nMost foreign medical schools do a great job of preparing their students to practice in the United States. Many of those schools are located on islands in the Caribbean \u2013 in places like Dominica and Antigua. At those schools, over 80 percent of graduates pass their Board exams and become practicing doctors in the United States. Often times, their tuitions are considerably less than many American schools. At the University of Illinois\u2014Chicago, out-of-state tuition is $72,422. That is almost double the cost of many Caribbean medical schools.\n\nThese Caribbean schools also focus on educating minorities to become doctors. This is critical, because American medical schools are failing miserably when it comes to educating minorities. In fact, according to the AAMC: \u201cAlthough blacks and African-Americans comprise 13 percent of the nation, they account for only 4 percent of the physician workforce.\u201d Not surprisingly, the greatest shortages of doctors are in this country are typically in minority communities.\n\nI urge Congress to ignore special interest lobbying and look at real legislation that will increase opportunities for physicians, especially in high need areas. The health and wellbeing of millions of Americans could very well depend on it.\n\nGoldberg is the co-founder of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, a non-partisan organization promoting innovative solutions that advance medical progress.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Congress\u2019 attempt to ensure that Americans who want to be doctors must train in the United States is shortsighted.", "description": "The Congress\u2019 attempt to ensure that Americans who want to be doctors must train in the United States is shortsighted.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Congress\u2019 attempt to ensure that Americans who want to be doctors must train in the United States is shortsighted.", "title": "Discrimination against foreign medical schools is bad for your health", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/247309-discrimination-against-foreign-medical-schools-is-bad-for-your", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/247309-discrimination-against-foreign-medical-schools-is-bad-for-your", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-09T14:30-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "author": "Robert Goldberg", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Richard Durbin,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-09T14:30:03-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/247309-discrimination-against-foreign-medical-schools-is-bad-for-your", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Congress\u2019 attempt to ensure that Americans who want to be doctors must train in the United States is shortsighted.", "card": "summary", "title": "Discrimination against foreign medical schools is bad for your health"}, "dcterms.title": "Discrimination against foreign medical schools is bad for your health"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc7b\"", "article_summary": "Known as the \u201cThe Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act,\u201d the bill discriminates against American citizens who want to attend foreign medical schools, regardless of the quality of those institutions.\nAccording to the AAMC, over 30 percent of practicing physicians in Illinois attended a foreign medical school and in Louisiana almost 20 percent of practicing physicians are foreign medical school graduates.\nMost foreign medical schools do a great job of preparing their students to practice in the United States.\nProvisions in the legislation would prevent hopeful doctors in this country from securing affordable student aid to attend many foreign medical schools.\nADVERTISEMENTIn reality, the only beneficiaries of the legislation would be one special interest group: medical schools in the United States."}
