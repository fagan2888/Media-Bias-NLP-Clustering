Tom Brady threw for four touchdowns and Malcolm Butler intercepted Russell Wilson's pass in the end zone with 20 seconds left, helping the New England Patriots hold on to beat the Seattle Seahawks 28-24 Sunday night for their fourth Super Bowl title.



The Patriots had lost three straight Super Bowls since winning three in four years a decade ago.



The 37-year-old Brady led them back, hitting Julian Edelman with 2:02 left for his 12th career Super Bowl touchdown pass, breaking Joe Montana's record.



The Seahawks pulled off a miraculous rally to beat Green Bay in the NFC Championship game and were in position for another improbable victory when Jermaine Kearse made a juggling, 33-yard catch while on his back.



With the ball on New England's 1, Seattle appeared to be headed toward a second straight Super Bowl title. Butler spoiled the Seahawks' bid, stepping in front of Ricardo Lockette for the interception.
