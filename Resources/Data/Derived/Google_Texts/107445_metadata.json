Residents don\u2019t pay sales tax and the state income tax was abolished in 1980, after the completion of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Each year, Alaskans receive a check based on earned interest from the Alaska Permanent Fund, which invests pooled oil and mineral royalties. (Last year\u2019s disbursement was a record high of $2,072 per person.)\n\nIt\u2019s a formula that has served the state well for many years, but with oil prices tanking, the state is now grappling with a multibillion-dollar deficit in its budget, prompting calls for sweeping changes in how the government is funded. Petroleum revenues plunged to a 21.3 percent share of the state general fund in the last fiscal year \u2014 down from 48.0 percent just one year prior, and 59.6 percent the year before that. The general fund itself has dwindled over the same interval, falling from $10.3 billion in 2013 to just under $4.9 billion in 2015.\n\nAlaska\u2019s plight is not unique. Western states \u2014 particularly Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming \u2014 are among those most reliant on extractive industries, and are thus the hardest hit by recent crashes in the price of oil, coal and natural gas. In Wyoming, for instance, extractive industries accounted for over a third of the state\u2019s GDP in 2013 \u2014 the highest proportion in the nation.\n\nThat dependence on boom-and-bust industries makes for a lot of economic uncertainty. A Pew analysis showed that Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming have three of the four highest levels of tax revenue volatility in the nation. Other Western states like California, Colorado (at No. 12), Arizona and New Mexico hold many of the top spots, due to a variety of factors not limited to severance taxes.\n\nBryce Gray is an editorial intern for High Country News (hcn.org).\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Gray: How much do Western states rely on oil, gas?", "title": "Gray: How much do Western states rely on oil, gas?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/15/gray-how-much-do-western-states-rely-on-oil-gas/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160415__DP_NGPS_Export20160417_Z00_OP17W_GRAYp1.jpg", "height": 461}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160415__DP_NGPS_Export20160417_Z00_OP17W_GRAYp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-15T11:50:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T01:22:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23e3\"", "article_summary": "Other Western states like California, Colorado (at No.\nEach year, Alaskans receive a check based on earned interest from the Alaska Permanent Fund, which invests pooled oil and mineral royalties.\nResidents don\u2019t pay sales tax and the state income tax was abolished in 1980, after the completion of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.\nWestern states \u2014 particularly Alaska, North Dakota and Wyoming \u2014 are among those most reliant on extractive industries, and are thus the hardest hit by recent crashes in the price of oil, coal and natural gas.\nIn Wyoming, for instance, extractive industries accounted for over a third of the state\u2019s GDP in 2013 \u2014 the highest proportion in the nation."}
