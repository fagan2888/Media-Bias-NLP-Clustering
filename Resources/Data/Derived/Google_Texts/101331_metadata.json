Two thirds of the open seats are currently held by a Republican.\n\nWhile dozens of members of the Texas Legislature are fighting for re-election across the state, a slew of open seats means there will be at least 18 freshman lawmakers come January \u2013 two in the Senate and 16 in the House.\n\nWith prominent legislators from both sides of the aisle opting not to return to their posts, some voters are having to choose between relatively unfamiliar candidates on the March 1 primary ballot.\n\nMost of the more than 70 candidates in these races have their work cut out for them. In presidential election years in particular, voters showing up to the polls are less likely to know about the races lower on the ballot, said Rice University political science professor Mark Jones.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re turning out to vote for either Ted Cruz or Donald Trump or Marco Rubio,\u201d Jones said, referring to the leading Republican candidates for president. \u201cMaybe some ads have reached them on a U.S. House race or a state Senate race, but by the time they get to the statehouse races, you have a significant proportion of voters who simply never heard of these candidates running for an open seat.\u201d\n\nTwo-thirds of the open seats are currently held by a Republican. A race without an incumbent may seem like a prime chance for the seat to flip from Republican to Democrat or vice versa, but such swing seat opportunities have become increasingly rare in Texas.\n\n\u201cThere are very few purple districts,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSo even though the Republican candidate or the Democratic candidate, depending on the district, won\u2019t get the advantage of incumbency, they still enjoy the advantage of the district being solid red or solid blue.\u201d\n\nRather than creating an opportunity for a party swap, races without incumbents open the door for smaller ideological shifts, according to Henry Flores, St. Mary\u2019s University political science professor. Often, candidates in the races are focusing on turning out certain segments of their party\u2019s base.\n\n\u201cIn Texas, if it\u2019s an open House seat in North Texas or West Texas, one of the areas that\u2019s traditionally Republican, it will mean something to the factions within that particular party,\u201d said Flores. \u201cWhat it will do is give one faction or the other within the Republican party the opportunity to win the seat.\u201d\n\nIn most of the open seats, the races are so crowded that no one is likely to draw the needed majority support to avoid a runoff. This year\u2019s primary runoff elections are scheduled for May 24.\n\nThe sparring among the candidates to land a slot in an expected runoff is particularly intense in the two open Senate seats.\n\nThe crowded race in Senate District 24 replace state Sen. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay, who decided not to seek re-election, has drawn six candidates from across a sprawling district that stretches from rom Abilene to the northwest suburbs of Austin: state Rep. Susan King, eye surgeon Dawn Buckingham, retired radiologist Brent Mayes, construction business owner Jon Cobb, Little River Health Care owner Ryan Downton and businessman Reed Williams.\n\n\u201cIn SD 24, it\u2019s a little bit more complex because it\u2019s such a spread out district and there are so many candidates that it\u2019s difficult to pin down whose in the best position,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBaring something very unexpected, we\u2019re looking at a runoff in that race.\u201d\n\nThe Senate District 1 race in Northeast Texas to replace outgoing Republican state Sen. Kevin Eltife\u2018s seat drew in state Reps. Bryan Hughes and David Simpson in addition to Army General James \u201cRed\u201d Brown and Mike Lee, a retired Navy hovercraft pilot.\n\nThe entrance of King, Hughes and Simpson into the two Senate races left three seats open in the House \u2013 Districts 5 and 7 in Northeast Texas and District 71, which includes Abilene and Sweetwater.\n\nDistricts 5 and 7 only drew Republican candidates \u2014 five in HD 5 and two in HD 7. Randy Davis, a Texas State Guard officer; businessman Jay Misenheimer; Philip Hayes, a former Senate staffer; real estate agent Holly Coggins Hayes; and Cole Hefner, an insurance salesman and former Upshur county commissioner, are competing for Hughes\u2019 seat, while Longview Mayor Jay Dean and businessman David Watts are running for Simpson\u2019s in HD 7.\n\nKing\u2019s HD 71 seat drew five Republicans and one Democrat. Attorney Chris Carnohan, former Hamilton Mayor Isaac Castro, Abilene ISD School Board trustee Stan Lambert, retired paramedic Stacey Scaief and retired firefighter Brian Scalf are all vying to win the Republican nomination and face Democrat Pierce LoPachin in November.\n\nBoth San Antonio and Houston stand to see a significant shakeup in their representation in the state Capitol due to a wave of retirements.\n\nIn San Antonio, three South Texas incumbents are not seeking re-election:\n\nThe Greater Houston area will also receive new representation in the House, as incumbents in Houston, Spring and Cypress are not running again.\n\nNewly elected Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner , a Democrat, left his seat in House District 139 to run for his current position, opening the door for four Democrats to run to replace him: Randy Bates, Jerry Ford Jr., Jarvis Johnson and Kimberly Willis.\n\nState Rep. Allen Fletcher, R-Cypress, decided not to seek re-election to House District 130, and announced his intentions to run for Harris County sheriff. Fletcher later decided not to enter the local race. Republicans Tom Oliverson, an anesthesiologist, and Kay Smith, the former president of the Texas Tea Party Republican Women, are running to replace him.\n\nIn the city of Spring, Republican state Rep. Patricia Harless announced she would not run again for her District 126 seat. Two Democrats will face off in the primary \u2013 Cris Hernandez and Joy Dawson-Thomas. One Republican, businessman Kevin Roberts, is running for the seat.\n\nThe remaining open seats are scattered across the state:\n\nEarly voting ends Friday. The primary election is on March 1.
