John Ondrasik, the singer-songwriter of the band Five for Fighting, says it\u2019s basically \u201cme and Kid Rock.\u201d\n\nOndrasik, known for hits like \u201cSuperman\u201d and \u201c100 Years\u201d and now marking the release of his sixth album, Bookmarks, got some attention last week after he tweeted about his experience getting physically removed from the Jefferson Memorial during the government shutdown.\n\nTheBlaze spoke with Ondrasik about that, the reaction from people when they find out he\u2019s conservative, and his new song that takes aim at the Sean Penns of the world.\n\nWhat\u2019s been the reaction to your experience at the Jefferson Memorial?\n\nIt\u2019s been wild, I never expected it to go viral, obviously it did. Next day, USA Today called me to write an op-ed, they told me my op-ed was the most-read piece on their site. A lot of people I think are passionate about what\u2019s going on and maybe some of those pictures kind of just brought it all out to the front for some folks. So I never expected it to get the reaction it did \u2014 I literally just went out for a jog that morning.\n\nOut of everything to do with the shutdown, closing the memorials and trying to keep veterans out seems to have resonated with people the most. Why do you think?\n\nI think there\u2019s one group you don\u2019t pick on, and that\u2019s the troops, and that\u2019s the veterans. And you don\u2019t use them as a political prop. And, you know, it seems obvious to me that there\u2019s a clear strategy by the White House to create optics that unnecessarily pain the average American, that give shutdown horror photo ops for the media. I\u2019m sure there are many \u201cpark closed\u201d signs laying around, but someone had to make up the \u201cpark closed due to SHUTDOWN\u201d in bold font with caps.\n\nWhy do you do that unless it\u2019s a political game? And I think you can probably get away with that, because the media will kind of enable you and join you, but I don\u2019t think you pick on the veterans, especially the World War II veterans \u2014 80-year-old men in wheelchairs who are going to roll right through your barricades. \u2026 Them going through and kind of breaking through the barricades was everybody\u2019s \u2014 (laughs) \u2014 or at least half the country\u2019s \u2014 response. And it\u2019s really sad, and it\u2019s really petty, and it\u2019s unnecessary, which makes me angry and I think which makes a lot of people angry.\n\nYou\u2019ve come a long way from performing at the Concert for New York City after 9/11 to campaigning with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan last year. Is this an evolution in your views, or is that you\u2019re comfortable enough in your career that you don\u2019t need to hold back anymore?\n\nWell, it\u2019s probably stupid and crazy. It\u2019s certainly career suicide to a certain degree. But you know, the reality is I think most of us tend to start our political beliefs with our parents, and my dad was a businessman and I grew up in a household where we were kind of center-right \u2013 by no means am I an ideologue \u2014 and I tend to lean more fiscally conservative. Playing the Concert for New York, obviously I got to meet many politicians, and I had friends and acquaintances on both the left and the right, and I still do.\n\nBut I do think, you know, you get to a certain point where you can bitch and moan all you want but if you\u2019re not doing anything, what are we really talking about? So I did take the step to go out with Mitt, and I thought that he would be a good president, I thought he was a good guy, kind of a centrist guy, a rational guy, a pragmatic guy, a guy who I believed could address the fiscal issues of the country. And, you know, would I do that 10 years ago when I was trying to grow my career? Probably not, but at this place in my life I think it\u2019s important to stand up for what you believe in, and if there are some arrows that come your way, so be it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly career suicide to a certain degree.\u201d \u2014 Five for Fighting on campaigning for Romney Share:\n\n(It was) also as an example to other folks. I mean, look \u2014 the reality is in the music business it\u2019s kind of me and Kid Rock. And I had the funny experience when I was out with Mitt in Ohio, I remember after an event \u2026 I was in the basement of a Red Roof Inn doing my laundry, and there was a little TV down there and I saw the president with Jay Z and Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi. And I took solace in the fact that well, in a couple hours, you know, Jay Z and Springsteen will be in the basement of a Red Roof Inn doing their laundry. I got a taste of the political experience and the campaign. And I\u2019m glad I did it. I wish he would\u2019ve won, but he didn\u2019t and, you know, scoreboard.\n\nWere you ever liberal?\n\nNo, I never was. I\u2019m not one of those people, I\u2019m not the Andrew Breitbarts of the world who started at one side and saw the light. But again, I would also have to say that I\u2019m no ideologue \u2013 I hammer the Republicans as much as I hammer the Democrats when I believe it. I think they made a calculated error with the shutdown over Obamacare, I think it\u2019s really foolish. I think they should\u2019ve just said, \u201cWe don\u2019t like it, we\u2019ll repeal it if we get control of the White House, until then everybody has to live under it, no delays, no postponements,\u201d but they didn\u2019t do that.\n\nAnd I\u2019ve been very frustrated with the outreach from the RNC, I\u2019ve said this before. I mean, I could tell you horror stories about how they try to use the few of us \u2013 and you know, there are a few of us in Hollywood, some actors, some musicians, who would support the cause \u2013 but our side, or the RNC, has no clue about the culture war. It\u2019s frankly embarrassing, and there\u2019s a reason a lot of us don\u2019t put ourselves out there because we end up getting burned.\n\nWould you say you\u2019ve become more conservative during the Obama years?\n\nI don\u2019t think so \u2026 I didn\u2019t vote for him, but when the president got elected, you know, I thought it was great to have an African American president, I was hopeful that he could bring the country together and decrease the divide. Unfortunately, it\u2019s kind of gone the other way. For me, I think my beliefs are the same \u2013 I\u2019m fairly socially moderate, I really don\u2019t care about those social issues that much. I\u2019m more about fiscal conservatism and foreign policy and I\u2019ve always been that way.\n\nI think what\u2019s frustrated me maybe more than the politics is the media \u2026 Andrew Breitbart was a good friend, and as political as he was, he was more concerned about the hypocrisy of the media, and to me I agree with that. I think politicians are going to do what\u2019s in their self-interest, but it\u2019s the media\u2019s job to hold them accountable and when you don\u2019t, you have government run amok, which we\u2019re starting to see right now. We\u2019re starting to see that there\u2019s no accountability, and to me that\u2019s the danger for our republic more than any politician or any cycle.\n\nWho do you socialize with who thinks the way you do? Is there some kind of secret conservative celebrity meeting?\n\nThere is a group out there but they all have jobs, and they don\u2019t want to risk their jobs and it\u2019s a sad thing \u2026 a lot of people are very scared \u2026 there is a group and there are some really good people out there.\n\nDo you ever have fellow entertainers say to you, \u201cI\u2019m with you, but I just can\u2019t come out\u201d of the conservative closet?\n\nI hear that more (from) film and TV than music. There are a few, I have heard that a couple of times. People say, \u201cHey, I appreciate you being out there, I wish I could, I just can\u2019t.\u201d What I hear a lot more often is when people find out my worldview is, \u201cWow, we thought you were such a nice guy.\u201d And people are shocked.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that my current single is a song called \u201cWhat If\u201d and the chorus is, \u201cwhat if you were me, what if I were you.\u201d I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a certain part of me that\u2019s like look, if you knew me and you knew my experience, maybe you\u2019d readjust your labeling and your generic thinking of the typical Republican, you know, the \u201csexist, racist, evil devil lord.\u201d\n\nI do believe at the end of the day, most Americans from both parties \u2013 not all of them, because some are just warriors that want to destroy the other side \u2013 most Americans want the same thing. They want to reward excellence, they want everybody to get a fair shot \u2026 all the same things, they want their kids to have a better chance than they did, they just have different strategies of how to get there, right?\n\nAnd for me, I was a math major \u2014 I\u2019m an analytical guy, I\u2019m a pragmatic guy. You show me data where I\u2019m wrong, I will change my mind. But for me, I just look at history and usually the conservative philosophy tends to make people\u2019s lives better. If it didn\u2019t, I\u2019d believe the other side. So again, I\u2019m more of a pragmatic guy and to this day, I\u2019m still hoping to change some minds. I think that\u2019s a big problem with this country, and I know Glenn (Beck) agrees, that\u2019s it\u2019s very hard to have the conversation. If we can\u2019t have the conversation, we can\u2019t solve problems.\n\nYour new song Rebel stands out to me a lot. It\u2019s the bonus track on \u201cBookmarks\u201d and seems to take a jab at the Sean Penns, Michael Moores and Sally Fields of the world.\n\nYes. (Laughs.) And there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s a bonus track. Yeah, it is by far the most political statement that I\u2019ve made and, you know, I\u2019ve wanted to say that for a long time. It\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ve always laughed when people call some of these celebrities \u201crebels\u201d because basically they just reflect the views of everyone in their business and all of their coworkers and everyone in the media. \u2026 It gives me more respect for people like Kid Rock. He\u2019ll go out there and say, \u201cHey, you know that\u2019s not what\u2019s called being a rebel \u2026 (it\u2019s) disagreeing with everyone who writes your check.\u201d \u2026 So yeah, I wanted to take somewhat of a satirical shot at some of these people who stand on the soapbox and are so \u201cbrave,\u201d and you mentioned a few of them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always laughed when people call some of these celebrities \u2018rebels.\u2019\u201d Share:\n\nWhat\u2019s the response to the song been?\n\nA few people like you who kind of know my views and are kind of immersed in this kind of culture war battle, they get it and they appreciate it. But for most people, they think it\u2019s about a girl, like most songs are. And that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s the nature of music and for me I tend to just \u2013 I tend to let the songs speak for themselves. And like I said, there\u2019s a reason that was song number 12 and the bonus track. It was more for me.\n\nAnd I totally understand, you have to walk the tightrope. We talked about some of these celebrities that are very political and kind of annoy us. And I understand \u2013 99.9 percent of people who buy my record, listen to my songs, they don\u2019t want to hear my political worldview. They want to escape from reality, they want to listen to some music. So I really try to walk the tightrope of not hammering it down people\u2019s throats. It\u2019s there if you want it, but most people don\u2019t, and I fully understand that.\n\nWhat\u2019s been the audience reaction to your politics \u2013 have you gained fans from being more outspoken, have you lost fans?\n\nYes. (Laughs.) There are people who have said, \u201cI will never buy another Five for Fighting record because you did Mike Huckabee\u2019s show.\u201d And that is just the reality of the game. When you make records and you\u2019ve had some success at the level I\u2019ve had, there\u2019s always going to be people that hate you, there\u2019s always going to be people that love you. \u2026 I bet you half the people on Twitter have never bought a Five for Fighting record or listened to a song. They\u2019re political sports fans, and that\u2019s cool, I like that, that\u2019s the place I go to talk about stuff that interests me.\n\n\u201cI will never buy another Five for Fighting record because you did Mike Huckabee\u2019s show.\u201d Share:\n\nOn Facebook, none of those people know my politics, and that\u2019s the way it should be. And so there\u2019s kind of two different worlds: there\u2019s a very small micro-world where a lot of people are like, \u201cOh yeah, we appreciate John because he\u2019ll say what other people won\u2019t,\u201d but it\u2019s a very small group. Most people out there just know my songs, and \u201cyou\u2019re the \u2018100 Years,\u2019 \u2018Superman\u2019 guy,\u201d and that\u2019s fine and that\u2019s the way it should be. There\u2019s different reasons to do it now than there were 10, 15 years ago.\n\nYou\u2019ve been on the scene long enough to watch pop culture change around you. Every generation has its own shocking moments \u2014 right now we\u2019re living in the era of Miley. But do you think there\u2019s anything different or too close to the edge now?\n\nWhenever you answer those questions, it\u2019s like, \u201coh you\u2019re just the old fogy, you don\u2019t get it.\u201d I think the one difference is this: when everyone was freaking out about the Beatles\u2019 haircuts, OK, it was traumatic for the culture. But it was the Beatles, OK? It was a band that was prolific \u2013 two of the greatest songwriters that ever lived, 40 years later we still listen to their music all the time.\n\nI think the difference is today, it\u2019s easy to get recognition when you take your clothes off, when you put the F-word in your songs, when you dance around and do things that seem crazy and provocative and shocking. But those artists I think for the most part (are) just lazy, and their music and what they\u2019re doing is for the most part disposable, and you\u2019re never going to hear it again after six months. \u2026 As a music fan it saddens me, because if you\u2019re going to talk about the greatest hits of this decade 10, 15 years from now, you\u2019re going to have very short playlist.\n\nIs there anything you\u2019ve been longing to take on creatively?\n\nYeah, I mean I\u2019ve been approached to do some stuff on the stage, some Broadway stuff, I\u2019ve been approached to do some TV stuff. I actually sold a TV show a few years ago that never saw the light of day. Maybe do some scoring, and maybe do some stuff completely out of the music stuff. I\u2019m not sure \u2013 I\u2019m at an interesting place right now, I\u2019ve had a wonderful career, I\u2019m very grateful. I\u2019ve made six records \u2014 \u201cBookmarks\u201d is my sixth record. I still enjoy playing and writing songs, but I\u2019m also young enough where I can still do some other things with the rest of my life.\n\nCould one of those things ever be politics?\n\nYou know, I don\u2019t know. I have been approached. \u2026 It\u2019s easy to take shots at politicians and we all do, but it\u2019s not the easiest life, and I do respect people who go into that game. Basically, you spend the majority of time raising money, shaking hands, doing events, and I don\u2019t know if I have that in me. I\u2019ve been on the road doing this for a long time, I don\u2019t know if I want to spend 200 days a year on the road, raising money, giving the same speech to get elected. I also don\u2019t think I have necessarily the patience and the stomach for what you have to do to get elected. I tend to speak my mind and there\u2019s very few people that do that (who) win.\n\nI\u2019m not saying never. \u2026 If the perfect situation arises I might. The reason I went out with Romney was I looked in the mirror and I said, \u201ceither you make a difference or you don\u2019t,\u201d so maybe that\u2019ll push me over the edge. I think that if I do it\u2019ll be after my kids are out of the house. I have a 12- and 13-year-old, and it\u2019s important for daddy to be around as much as possible. I think, when they go, if the opportunity is there and I have the energy for it, you never know.\n\nInterview has been edited and condensed.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Madeleine Morgenstern on Twitter @MadeleineBlaze\n\nOther Must-Read Stories\n\n\u2022 Five for Fighting Singer Tweets Getting Shoved Out of the Jefferson Memorial\n\n\u2022 Actor After Critical Obama Stance: \u2018I Don\u2019t Expect to Work Again\u2019 but \u2018My Country First\u2019\n\n\u2022 This Star Refuses to Call Troops Merely \u2018Soldiers\u2019 \u2014 See What He\u2019s Doing for Our Injured Heroes\n\n\u2022 Hollywood Icon Has a Message for Tinseltown Most Actors Won\u2019t Want to Hear", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "gplus-count": 9, "twitter": {"description": "If it seems like it's hard to find conservatives in Hollywood, finding conservatives in the music industry can be an even rarer feat.\u00a0John Ondrasik, the singer-songwriter of the band Five for Fighting, says it's basically \"me and Kid Rock.\"  Ondrasik, known for hits like \"Superman\" and \"100 Years\"...", "title": "Five for Fighting on Obama, Deciding to Campaign for Romney & the New Song Taking Aim at the Sean Penns of the World", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/10/13/five-for-fighting-on-obama-why-campaigning-for-romney-was-career-suicide-the-new-song-taking-aim-at-the-sean-penns-of-the-world/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/John-Ondrasik-FFF-620x362.jpeg", "creator": "@MadeleineinDC", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "five, fighting, john, ondrasik, conservative, five, fighting, mitt, romney, five, fighting, john, ondrasik, jefferson, memorial", "sailthru.tags": "original, editor-picks, entertainment, mitt-romney, author-madeleine-morgenstern, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 5543, "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "categories": "original,editor-picks,mitt-romney,entertainment", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 220, "description": "If it seems like it's hard to find conservatives in Hollywood, finding conservatives in the music industry can be an even rarer feat.\u00a0John Ondrasik, the singer-songwriter of the band Five for Fighting, says it's basically \"me and Kid Rock.\"  Ondrasik, known for hits like \"Superman\" and \"100 Years\"...", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/679760", "linkedin-count": 6, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "If it seems like it's hard to find conservatives in Hollywood, finding conservatives in the music industry can be an even rarer feat.\u00a0John Ondrasik, the singer-songwriter of the band Five for Fighting, says it's basically \"me and Kid Rock.\"  Ondrasik, known for hits like \"Superman\" and \"100 Years\"...", "title": "Five for Fighting on Obama, Deciding to Campaign for Romney & the New Song Taking Aim at the Sean Penns of the World", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/10/13/five-for-fighting-on-obama-why-campaigning-for-romney-was-career-suicide-the-new-song-taking-aim-at-the-sean-penns-of-the-world/", "image": {"width": 620, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/John-Ondrasik-FFF-620x362.jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 362}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2013-10-13T09:54:03+00:00", "twitter-count": 404}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd82c4\"", "article_summary": "And for me, I was a math major \u2014 I\u2019m an analytical guy, I\u2019m a pragmatic guy.\nI also don\u2019t think I have necessarily the patience and the stomach for what you have to do to get elected.\nYou know, I don\u2019t know.\nBasically, you spend the majority of time raising money, shaking hands, doing events, and I don\u2019t know if I have that in me.\nBut do you think there\u2019s anything different or too close to the edge now?"}
