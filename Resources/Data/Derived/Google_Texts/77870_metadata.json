Barack Obama said while campaigning in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on March 31, 2008.\n\n\u201cThe biggest problems that we\u2019re facing right now have to do with George Bush trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through Congress at all,\u201d Obama continued, \u201cand that\u2019s what I intend to reverse when I\u2019m president of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nMore than six years later, we now know that Obama never had any intention of taking the Constitution seriously. Instead, he has violated its core provisions at every turn, launching unauthorized wars, rewriting legislation without Congress\u2019 input, and even creating brand new laws out of whole cloth.\n\nWhen Obama first uttered the phrase, \u201cIf Congress won\u2019t act, I will,\u201d he functionally declared war on the U.S. Constitution. And unless Republicans start standing up to Obama\u2019s lawlessness, our republic may never be the same.\n\nEMBRACING BUSH\u2019S WAR POWERS\n\nObama made his 2008 promise to \u201creverse\u201d Bush\u2019s power grab after a supporter questioned why Obama had voted for reauthorization of the Patriot Act in 2006 after he had promised to vote against the legislation when he was a U.S. Senate candidate in 2003.\n\nIn classic Obama fashion, Obama denied all responsibility for his vote. Instead he blamed Bush for issuing executive orders that ignored the limits of existing federal law. Now, six years later, Obama is still presiding over much the same National Security Administration spying program that he once pronounced a \u201cgrave threat\u201d to civil liberties, and the Guantanamo Bay detention facility that he said threatened America\u2019s \u201cmoral stature in the world,\u201d is also still running strong.\n\n\n\nUNAUTHORIZED WAR\n\nAdditionally, not only has Obama embraced the war powers he once derided Bush for claiming, but he has expanded them substantially.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rejected by the American people in 2010, President Obama has abandoned and pretense of working with Congress, and is attempting to rule by administrative fiat..05/25/2016 15:42:24PM EST.", "author": "Conn Carroll", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Rejected by the American people in 2010, President Obama has abandoned and pretense of working with Congress, and is attempting to rule by administrative fiat.", "title": "Conn Carroll - Obama's War on the Constitution", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2014/06/03/obamas-war-on-the-constitution-n1846624", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/112/2014-04-22T210201Z_1_CBREA3L1MFY00_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA-NEWSCONFERENCENEWSCONFERENCE.JPG", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Rejected by the American people in 2010, President Obama has abandoned and pretense of working with Congress, and is attempting to rule by administrative fiat.", "title": "Conn Carroll - Obama's War on the Constitution", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/conncarroll/2014/06/03/obamas-war-on-the-constitution-n1846624", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/112/2014-04-22T210201Z_1_CBREA3L1MFY00_RTROPTP_3_USA-OBAMA-NEWSCONFERENCENEWSCONFERENCE.JPG", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Obama's War on the Constitution, Conn Carroll, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde2cc\"", "article_summary": "When Obama first uttered the phrase, \u201cIf Congress won\u2019t act, I will,\u201d he functionally declared war on the U.S. Constitution.\nUNAUTHORIZED WARAdditionally, not only has Obama embraced the war powers he once derided Bush for claiming, but he has expanded them substantially.\n\"You know I taught constitutional law for 10 years, I take the Constitution very seriously,\u201d then-Sen.
