But Democrats haven\u2019t stood still and apparently have a new edge in another area: testing the effectiveness of campaign messages with different audiences.\n\nA new article in Campaigns and Elections magazine says one of the big reasons Terry McAuliffe narrowly won the Virginia governorship in November was that he was on the cutting edge of \u201ca progressive revolution in modeling, targeting, persuasion and turnout\u201d of voters. By contrast, the article\u2019s authors conclude that \u201cit is exceedingly rare to find anyone on the right who is aware\u201d of the use of controlled experiments to fashion political messaging. Because McAuliffe beat Republican Ken Cuccinelli by only just over 2 percent of the vote, the article speculates that the GOP could have won if it had done better research on which messages and which media-delivery platforms would have worked best in discrediting McAuliffe.\n\nThe article was written by Adam Schaeffer, a co-founder of the research firm Evolving Strategies, and Nancy Smith, the Grassroots Coordinator for Middle Resolution PAC. Their controlled experiments on which messages could have helped Cuccinelli close the gap are worth examining.\n\nSurprisingly, Schaeffer and Smith conclude that pouring more resources into Cuccinelli\u2019s last-minute attack on Obamacare\u2019s emerging woes wouldn\u2019t have been more effective.\n\nGreater efforts to discredit McAuliffe\u2019s business career, which included a failing, government-subsidized \u201cgreen car\u201d company would have done better in turning voters away from the Democrat, but were unlikely to be a game-changer.\n\nThe one message that could have dramatically shifted voters would have been one attacking McAuliffe\u2019s support for unrestricted, late-term, and taxpayer-funded abortions. Schaeffer and Smith conclude that a single phone message on that topic \u201cshifted support a net 13 to 15 points away from McAuliffe and toward Cuccinelli.
