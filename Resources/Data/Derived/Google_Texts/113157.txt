BRIDGEWATER — Standing among hundreds of guests gathered for a colleague’s retirement party a few years ago, someone asked Silvio Laccetti about his plans for his pending retirement from Stevens Institute of Technology.

Would the veteran professor hold a similar bash to celebrate his 40-year teaching career?

Laccetti immediately shook his head.

"Without even stopping, I thought, ‘Why would I want to do that when I could have 100 retirement dinners?' " Laccetti said.

So, the humanities professor came up with a plan: He would celebrate the end of his career by tracking down 100 of his former students and inviting them individually to dinner.

After five years — and 88 dinners — Laccetti is nearing his goal. His tour of his past has taken him to restaurants in Texas, Tennessee, Georgia, Maryland, Oklahoma and every corner of New Jersey.

Along the way, the former professor helped answer the question that nags many aging teachers: Did I make a difference?

Laccetti said he found many of the young adults who filled his classrooms from the 1960s to the 2000s had launched successful careers, had families and had fond memories of his classes. Many could still recall lessons learned in his social sciences courses.

"The amazing thing is it’s as if you’ve seen them yesterday," Laccetti said.

Laccetti, a Bergen County native, began teaching on Stevens Institute of Technology’s Hoboken campus in the mid-1960s after he received his doctorate in history and international politics. The job was not easy, he said. He taught humanities courses, including history and urban studies, at a university best known for turning out tech-minded engineers.

"They are not there to learn about the Franco-Prussian War," Laccetti said.

Over the decades, Laccetti saved a small collection of term papers, exam booklets and other work from his students. He used those papers to compile the list of former students he wanted to invite to dinner, including one undergraduate he remembered from the first class he taught. With the help of Stevens’ alumni directory, he tracked most of them down.

"After you finally call them after 25 years, they wonder, ‘Why did you remember me?’â " Laccetti said.

Stevens graduate Michael Poland said he was startled to get a message that an old professor had tried to reach him by calling his parents’ house.

"It was kind of out there — having not spoken to him in over 10 years," said Poland, a 1999 graduate now working as an engineer at a firm in Freehold.

But Poland said his dinner with Laccetti at an Italian restaurant in Hoboken was not as awkward as he expected. Afterward, he understood why the professor wanted to reconnect with his students.

"His students were an extension of his family," said Poland, of Howell.

Linda McKenna and her twin sister, Lisa McKenna-Hutchings, joined Laccetti for a lively dinner at the Cheesecake Factory in Bridgewater last month. The twins, who graduated from Stevens in 1986, vividly recalled Laccetti’s course on the transformation of the nation from a manufacturing economy to an information economy.

"It was a really, really good class," McKenna said. "He has always remained one of my favorite professors."

McKenna credits Laccetti with inspiring her to start her own consulting company by repeatedly telling students that they would never make any real money by working for someone else.

"His words echoed through my head," said McKenna, owner of LCM Consulting in Kinnelon.

So far, Laccetti said he has dined with 107 former students during his 88 meals. In every case, his former students have picked up the tab.

In return, the professor gives his old students copies of their long-forgotten papers and exams. He also gives them a copy of his 1990 book, "New Jersey Profiles in Public Policy."

At one dinner, with a former student at a restaurant in Hoboken, Laccetti said he ran into "Moonstruck" actor Danny Aiello, a regular at the restaurant. Aiello joked with the professor about making a movie out of his retirement dinner tour, though Laccetti said Hollywood has not come calling yet.

Over the past few years, the dinners have helped fill the void left when he stopped teaching, said Laccetti, who declines to reveal his age and lives alone in Bergen County. He has also filled his days writing opinion pieces, including some for The Star-Ledger. His latest book, "An American Commentary: Social Problems That Changed America in the 21st Century," is scheduled to come out later this year.

Laccetti wrote about his retirement dinner odyssey for the latest issue of the American Association of University Professors magazine in a piece titled "Back to My Future."

The professor said he encourages anyone coming to an end of a career to embark on a similar tour to relive the past and learn some lessons for the future.

"The old can be new in many ways — no matter what your life’s work or avocation," Laccetti said.
