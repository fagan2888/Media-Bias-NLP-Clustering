Nor is it by any means the biggest nor the first such favor Obama has provided his political allies in organized labor. Unions may be a weak and dying segment of the electorate, but they nonetheless command large sums of money and wield the muscle power that keeps Democratic candidates strong.\n\nThe bailout of the United Autoworkers' benefits fund at the expense of non-union employees in the auto industry was one of Obama's first acts in office. Since then, his appointees have been working overtime to carve out new and unprecedented privileges for union bosses.\n\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.

Most recently, the decision on joint-employer status overturned 34 years of precedent, threatening to destroy the subcontracting and franchising models that have allowed many businesses (McDonalds and Uber, for example) to expand and thrive. All this in the name of empowering unions at smaller companies to dictate the terms of how much larger companies are run.\n\nObama's NLRB has also approved the formation of so-called \"micro-unions,\" which helps unions infiltrate companies where a majority of workers would oppose union representation. It has backed shorter time-frames for unionization elections \u2014 again in an effort to increase the rate of union election wins. It has expanded unions' ability to challenge basic rules governing employee conduct, such as avoiding profanity on the job and not gossiping about coworkers.\n\nIn 2010, Obama's NLRB even handed down a decision allowing union organizers to conspire with employers to make secret, sweetheart deals against workers' interests \u2014 as in, let us win this unionization election and get access to employees' dues money, and in exchange we won't demand too much on their behalf.\n\nThe Obama administration's naked pro-union activism has been so aggressive that three states have passed right-to-work laws during his presidency to provide workers and employers a partial opt-out from Obama's labor policy. That's more than at any time since the Eisenhower era.\n\nWhat all of Obama's favors for union bosses have in common is that they swim against the tide of the U.S. labor market. Unions are irrelevant to nearly all of today's private sector workers and especially to the younger ones. Only 25 percent of union membership is under age 35, compared to 38 percent of all non-union workers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "For labor unions, the Obama era has been bittersweet.
