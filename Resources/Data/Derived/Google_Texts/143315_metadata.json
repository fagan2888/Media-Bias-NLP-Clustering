The alleged abuses include kickbacks to doctors and excessive, high-cost drug testing. Mondy pointed to several stories published recently in The Palm Beach Post about questionable billing practices to back up the company's claims of fraud.\n\nAbout 30,000 Floridians in 23 counties, including Lee and Sarasota counties, purchased Cigna policies on the exchange for this year, according to Cigna and the state's Office of Insurance Regulation. It did not offer them in Collier or Charlotte.\n\nThe company's decision to temporarily suspend its marketplace participation, first reported by Health News Florida, came just weeks before the Nov. 1 start of Obamacare's enrollment period.\n\nNotices to brokers were sent via email last week, Mondy said. Customers notification letters went out over the weekend.\n\nCigna said it did not become fully aware of the scope of the alleged fraud until the government's deadline to submit plans for 2016 had passed. As a result, the company will pull out this year and retool the plans for 2017, Mondy said.\n\nIndividuals can still buy Cigna plans through brokers. But, because they will not be offered through the federal exchange, buyers of those plans would not be eligible for premium-reducing tax credits, Cigna noted.\n\n\"We understand that this action will cause significant disruption for you and your customers, and we will assist you and your customers through this transition,\" the Cigna letter to brokers states. \"We are fully committed to the Florida market and look forward to reentering the public health insurance marketplace in 2017 with a new portfolio of health plans...\"\n\nAmy Bogner, spokeswoman for the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation said other insurers have voiced similar concerns, though no others have announced a pullout from the marketplace for this reason. Bogner did not identify those other insurers, citing ongoing reviews of their claims.\n\nConnect with this reporter: @FrankGluck (Twitter)\n\nRead or Share this story: http://newspr.es/1RY9BkL", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Health insurer Cigna has announced it will withdraw Florida plans from the government's exchange to avoid what it considers fraudulent billing from substance abuse treatment centers.", "og": {"site_name": "The News-Press", "description": "Health insurer Cigna has announced it will withdraw Florida plans from the government's exchange to avoid what it considers fraudulent billing from substance abuse treatment centers.", "title": "Cigna pulling out of FL health marketplace in 2016", "url": "http://www.news-press.com/story/news/local/2015/10/22/cigna-pulling-out-fl-health-obamacare-marketplace-2016/74344980/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/news-press.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health insurer Cigna has announced it will withdraw Florida plans from the government's exchange to avoid what it considers fraudulent billing from substance abuse treatment centers.", "title": "Cigna pulling out of FL health marketplace in 2016", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/64fb98cefe187d41fcca66420dbb134916746054/c=458-0-1088-630&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/22/FortMyers/FortMyers/635810948694977598-cigna-logo-og.jpg", "creator": "@thenewspress", "site": "@thenewspress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600073397", "fb": {"app_id": 149631068421067}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, aca, obamacare, cigna, florida, exchange"}, "article_summary": "Cigna Health logo (Photo: Logo)Southwest Floridians who purchased Cigna insurance on the government's Health Insurance Marketplace will have to shop for new policies in the coming weeks if they want to remain covered.\nIndividuals can still buy Cigna plans through brokers.\n\"Cigna is temporarily discontinuing its participation on the Florida public health insurance marketplace for 2016 because we have experienced an exponential increase in fraudulent and abusive care delivery practices in 2015 in Florida,\" Spokesman Joseph Mondy said in a written statement.\nAbout 30,000 Floridians in 23 counties, including Lee and Sarasota counties, purchased Cigna policies on the exchange for this year, according to Cigna and the state's Office of Insurance Regulation.\nThe company's decision to temporarily suspend its marketplace participation, first reported by Health News Florida, came just weeks before the Nov. 1 start of Obamacare's enrollment period."}
