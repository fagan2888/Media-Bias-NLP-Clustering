The strain is high in cannabidiol or CBD, the ingredient that controls seizures, but is low in tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, the compound that creates a high. Their emotional pleas convinced the chairman of the legislative committee of the Florida House to support such a bill.\n\nNaturally, any opponent of such a move will be considered a heartless and uncaring individual. Most probably, the medical ethics of physicians opposing such a decision will be questioned, too.\n\nBut let's consider the facts: Charlotte's Web is a strain of medical marijuana developed in Colorado by the Stanley brothers and featured in the 2013 CNN documentary \"Weed,\" hosted by Sanjay Gupta. It is named after Charlotte Figi, who experienced an immediate and remarkable reduction of her epileptic seizures after her first dose of medical marijuana at 5 years of age.\n\nThe sudden publicity of this specific strain of medical marijuana is based on anecdotal evidence only but is now being used to justify the use of medical marijuana in general. Well meaning proponents of clinical research point out that such clinical research is blocked by strict Federal laws. Therefore, they call for reclassification of marijuana to facilitate the kind of rigorous evaluation that\u2019s needed to determine the appropriate, physician-supervised doses and uses of medical marijuana.\n\nBut before we join the chorus singing the praise of medical marijuana we should step back and analyze the facts. I recommend reading an article published in the Epilepsy Curr. 2013 Mar-Apr; 13(2): 81\u201382 titled \" Slim Evidence for Cannabinoids for Epilepsy\" which concluded that no reliable conclusions can be drawn at present regarding the efficacy of cannabinoids as a treatment for epilepsy. The dose of 200 to 300 mg daily of cannabidiol was safely administered to small numbers of patients, for generally short periods of time, and so the safety of long term cannabidiol treatment cannot be reliably assessed. The authors base their assessment of the efficacy of marijuana, or one of marijuana's constituents in the treatment of people with epilepsy on an exhaustive search of the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (May 15, 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL issue\n\n4 of 12, and the Cochrane Library 2012), MEDLINE (PubMed, searched on May 15, 2012), ISI Web of Knowledge.\n\nThis Cochrane review searched for direct evidence that cannabinoids can prevent human seizures in studies using the only acceptable standard, the randomized controlled trial. The researchers identified four studies, with a total of 48 patients randomized to placebo or to 200\u2013300 mg of cannabidiol per day. This particular cannabinoid has few psychotropic effects and is not a controlled substance. Overall, these studies demonstrate the short-term tolerability of this treatment, with the only noted adverse effect being drowsiness in one study.\n\nExcept for one study that reported two of four treated patients becoming seizure free for 3 months, the studies either reported no benefit, or the effect was not clearly stated. Methods of randomization or determining outcome were inadequate or not clearly detailed.\n\nMarijuana itself has major shortcomings as an epilepsy treatment. Its psychotropic action can only be regarded as an adverse effect. It is a biological product containing multiple compounds with unclear, possible, anti- or pro-convulsant effects, delivered in varying amounts from dose to dose. Long-term safety has not been adequately investigated.\n\nThe authors correctly stated that new treatments for epilepsy are sorely needed. Cannabidiol or other individual cannabinoids with minimal adverse effects could be extracted and given in precise doses in rigorously designed, blinded, randomized clinical trials to test efficacy and safety.\n\nIn my opinion this is the only reasonable route for development of new anti-epileptic drugs. Legislative efforts, as well intended they may be, cannot substitute for the gold standards of scientific evidence.\n\nUnfortunately, nobody seems to have the fortitude to stand up and to defend those principles in public. I am afraid that medical science will have to succumb to populism and the efforts to create quick fixes and miracle cures. But at what price?\n\nBernd Wollschlaeger,MD\n\nFamily Physician of the Year Award, 2012\n\nNorth Miami Beach", "article_metadata": {"category": "Opinion", "description": "To the Editor: Re: Florida lawmaker agrees to work to legalize medical marijuanaThis story in the Tampa Bay Times reported that Florida legislators agreed", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/marijuana-treatment-needs-scientific-testing", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201401/Dr._Bernd_Wollschlaeger.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "To the Editor: Re: Florida lawmaker agrees to work to legalize medical marijuanaThis story in the Tampa Bay Times reported that Florida legislators agreed", "title": "Marijuana 'Treatment' Needs Scientific Testing"}, "story_id": 264371329, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Health News Florida Staff", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Marijuana &#039;Treatment&#039; Needs Scientific Testing"}, "nid": 5245, "datePublished": "2014-01-20", "wordCount": 794, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf8bd\"", "article_summary": "The sudden publicity of this specific strain of medical marijuana is based on anecdotal evidence only but is now being used to justify the use of medical marijuana in general.\nBut before we join the chorus singing the praise of medical marijuana we should step back and analyze the facts.\nTherefore, they call for reclassification of marijuana to facilitate the kind of rigorous evaluation that\u2019s needed to determine the appropriate, physician-supervised doses and uses of medical marijuana.\nMarijuana itself has major shortcomings as an epilepsy treatment.\nBut let's consider the facts: Charlotte's Web is a strain of medical marijuana developed in Colorado by the Stanley brothers and featured in the 2013 CNN documentary \"Weed,\" hosted by Sanjay Gupta."}
