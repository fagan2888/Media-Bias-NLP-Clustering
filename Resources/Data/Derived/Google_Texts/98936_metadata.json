He adds:\n\nGenerally speaking, most normal working people are sick and tired of politicians saying one thing and doing another after they are elected, and would welcome a non-political candidate who hasn\u2019t lied to them before.\n\nPollsters detect this same discontent among voters, especially Republicans and independents as they contemplate a GOP field that has grown to 17 candidates.\n\nThey may not be sure what they want, but they want something different, Zogby Poll founder John Zogby says. At this early stage, Republicans remain split over whether to nominate a conservative\u2014and what a \u201ctrue conservative\u201d is.\n\n\u201cRepublican voters also tell us they want someone with management experience, experience in government, but close behind that is experience in business,\u201d Zogby said in an interview early this summer with The Daily Signal. He added:\n\nThey want a problem solver, a consensus builder, but ultimately it really depends on how the candidates emerge, stay on their feet and then, most importantly, capture the right moment. \u2026 Republicans as well as Democrats are pretty well jaded by everything and doubting, to some degree, whether government can even function.\n\nSimilarly, Fran Coombs, managing editor of Rasmussen Reports, says the polling firm has found for more than two years that large majorities of likely voters agree the country is going in the wrong direction. Democrats tend to be evenly divided on the question.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense in the country that things are not going well,\u201d Coombs told The Daily Signal. \u201cUnderstandably, people have different ideas on what they want done.\u201d\n\nLikely GOP voters became especially upset about Obamacare and illegal immigration, Coombs said, as did unaffiliated voters\u2014only less so.\n\n\u201cGenerally,\u201d he said, \u201ceverybody is unhappy with the economy and concerned about terrorism.\u201d\n\n>>> 21 Policy Highlights From the First 2016 Republican Debate\n\nConservatives such as Whaley\u2014who worked in sales for IBM, Procter & Gamble and Universal Pensions\u2014don\u2019t think they\u2019ve had one of their own as a GOP nominee since Ronald Reagan\u2019s re-election campaign in 1984.\n\nBefore Reagan\u2019s 1980 nomination, they argue, the party hadn\u2019t put forward a conservative since Barry Goldwater in 1964.\n\n\u201cHow many election cycles will conservatives put up with Republicans talking about conservative goals and then after being elected supporting much the same agenda as liberals?\u201d asks Whaley, a former history major who splits his time between Deerwood, Minn., and Lake Havasu City, Ariz.\n\nIn email interviews with The Daily Signal, other older Republicans who are following the 2016 race say the party should swear off \u201cestablishment\u201d candidates if they aren\u2019t committed to principles of limited government, free markets and individual freedom.\n\nFour sitting governors and five former ones joined the GOP field. So did four incumbent senators and one former senator. Plus a neurosurgeon, a former business executive and a real estate magnate.\n\nSo what is Whaley, who served four years in the Minnesota National Guard, looking for as the debates begin? He puts it this way:\n\nI believe in what made this country successful to start with: individualism, entrepreneurship, moral values and lack of government intrusion into people\u2019s lives. Liberalism is slowly destroying all of these things, and big government is becoming a way of life even in the Republican Party. So my main concern in any politician is, do they have the same belief system as I do? And do they have the best interests of the country at heart, not just making a career for themselves and being a good party member? I would have to say I don\u2019t really care about what will or won\u2019t benefit me the rest of my life, but I am very concerned about the future of my kids and grandkids, which I believe is not going to be nearly as good as it could be if the country keeps drifting left. \u2026 Conservatives need to get people thinking positively about being politically active and why not being active, interested and politically educated is why things like Obamacare [and] illegal immigration are thrown at them and why the country is $18 trillion in debt. That debt will have to be paid by young people today and their children, which will almost assuredly make their lives much less rewarding than they should be.\n\nIt\u2019ll be another six months before the first votes of the 2016 primary season are cast in Iowa and New Hampshire. Here is a glimpse, at this juncture, of what\u2019s on the minds of some other older conservative readers who exchanged emails with The Daily Signal.\n\nRick Parks, 70, Las Vegas. Parks, who retired as an Air Force major after 28 years of active duty, met his bride while stationed in Korea in 1971. He says he followed in the footsteps of his father, who served in World War II as an Army Air Corps pilot. He is Catholic.\n\nSomething he worries about: \u201cHow long now have we been satisfied with merely accepting whatever is put in front of us? That isn\u2019t the American way; excellence is the American way. \u2026 Staff at the Osan Air Base personnel office advised me [in 1971] that although I was a career military man, there was no guarantee that my wife would be granted a quota to [come] to the States with me.\n\nNow, we just open the borders and let in everyone, regardless of their health condition or financial self-sufficiency? Ridiculous! We are creating a never-ending succession of wards of the state and rewarding criminal foreign governments, which won\u2019t care for their own people and send them our direction all the time.\n\nWhat he\u2019s looking for: \u201cI\u2019m looking for a candidate who believes in and fully supports the Constitution, American exceptionalism and the American people. The candidate should be truthful, honest and humble, knowing that their position as president is to serve all Americans and to lead us, but not to be our emperor, king or dictator.\u201d\n\n***\n\nHerb Branch, 71, Easton, Md. Branch, who grew up and lived most of his adult life in Ohio, is a retired engineer and data analyst. He and his wife, who have three grown sons, also lived in Israel before and after 9/11 to do humanitarian and other charity work. Three of their grandchildren are in college.\n\n>>> Highlights of the Republicans\u2019 Happy Hour Debate\n\nBranch\u2019s parents were Jeffersonian Democrats who left the party in 1939, he says. As a 20-year-old college student in 1964, Branch campaigned for Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater. He says he supported Reagan\u2019s failed primary bid in 1976, and then his successful races in 1980 and 1984. Branch consistently has voted Republican in presidential elections.\n\nWhat he worries about: \u201cThe GOP will become a permanent minority party, never again to win national office elections. That is what this immigration issue is all about. And it will produce a permanent demographic advantage for Democrats.\u201d Branch adds:\n\nThe U.S. exists in a nearly universally hostile world of pretend friends in Europe, plus genuine enemies, plus Israel\u2014who wants to see the older, more reliable America re-emerge from all of its internal angst and self-doubt and self-hate from U.S. liberalism\u2019s giving up everything that ever mattered most in life and for liberty.\n\n***\n\nMarc Jennings, 67, Hoschton, Ga. Jennings is a retired cable television system executive who now is a consultant on cable issues for rural telephone companies. Jennings, an officer in the Marine Corps in the early 1970s, sees the marriage debate as \u201ccritically important to the future of our country and its culture.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s looking for: \u201cI think this is important for all candidates: Can we trust them to stay true to core principles [while being open to] common sense evolution of positions based on new information?\u201d Jennings adds:\n\nI think most conservatives believe we have moved so far away from our founding principles (in governing and culture) that we desperately need strong corrections. We are suspicious of government and looking for a leader of strong convictions who we can trust to follow through on promises and who is persuasive and talented enough to lead the country and massive government.\n\n***\n\nGoldie Jones, 70, Tavares, Fla., retired seven years ago from University of Illinois. Her husband, also retired, was an area manager in farm supplies and petroleum. The Joneses have six children, 11 grandchildren and one great-grandchild. They vote in Florida but also maintain a home in Illinois.\n\nWhat she\u2019s looking for: \u201cI would like a strong leader without political bull [who] will follow the Constitution. I am really sick of all the regulations [and] corruption, and the White House thinking the law doesn\u2019t pertain to them. They are not held accountable. \u2026 I\u2019m sick of the pork and the debt. Stop borrowing money from China to give to other countries.\u201d\n\nSomething she worries about: \u201cPlease, someone with some backbone be our next president. \u2026 We want a Reagan [who] will bring America back waving the mighty flag and the importance of \u2018in God we trust.\u2019 \u201d\n\n***\n\nKen Kasalis, 65, Concord, Calif., is a retired retail salesman, airline worker and teacher. The Brooklyn native recalls his pride as a seventh-grader in handing out flyers on Election Day 1960 for a fellow Irish Catholic, John F. Kennedy. Kasalis recalls:\n\nI was a Democrat until they seemed to move from anti-war to anti-traditional values, namely their embrace of abortion rights without any restrictions. I was proud of JFK. That Democrat Party does not exist for me any longer.\n\nWhat he worries about: \u201cThe threat of terrorism, a lackluster economy, inner-city decay, a public education system that underperforms, welfare becoming a way of life for many, illegal immigration running unchecked.\n\n\u201cI wish the media would be as outraged at the IRS scandal \u2026 as they are over a bakery objecting to making a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.\u201d\n\nWhat he\u2019s looking for: \u201cFor me, a president should be proud to be an American. Someone who recognizes our unique history and soul, leader of a great nation \u2026 who many people the world over look to for leadership and morality.\u201d He adds:\n\nSomeone who does not seek to make Americans jealous of each other and feel like victims. Compassionate, yes, but possessing common sense in solving problems while respecting our Constitution and laws. Someone who can admit a mistake, and not call honest dissent a personal attack.\n\nJerry Cox, 74, Clarksville, Tenn. Cox, who retired after working as a senior finance manager for two top computer and software manufacturers, says he rejects \u201cbig government involvement in all facets of our lives\u201d as promoted by liberal Democrats and establishment Republicans.\n\nSomething he worries about: \u201cCorrupted\u201d and \u201cout of control\u201d federal agencies such as the IRS and Environmental Protection Agency, illegal immigration, and \u201coverreaching\u201d federal judges.\n\nWhat he\u2019s looking for: \u201cI believe our next president, especially if conservative at all, will inherit the biggest social and economic changes of our times\u2014the last eight years. And to try and get the country on track he will have to be [a] strong leader [with] thick skin, with a belief in values and solutions [that] will work, and proven so by the candidate.\u201d\n\nCox, who also started two businesses and now devotes time to a Christian mission project, adds: \u201cHe will have to deal with runaway spending and deficits and a propped-up economy being held together with glue.\u201d\n\n***\n\nPamela West, 56, Portland, Ore. A small business owner, West describes herself as \u201ca life-long conservative Republican.\u201d She is a Mormon and the mother of five children.\n\nWhat she\u2019s looking for: \u201cAs I consider the candidates, I measure everyone against Mitt Romney. Overall, this field is better than in 2012, but none matches Romney. He\u2019s the gold standard, and remains the most qualified and prepared.\u201d\n\nHowever, West initially finds at least five of the candidates appealing.\n\n***\n\nRobin Humphrey, 74, Crystal River, Fla. Humphrey\u2019s career took him to several South American nations, including 15 years with a major oil company. A Big 10 college graduate, he served in the Navy from 1963 to 1968, including a year in Saigon. He moved with his wife to Florida upon his retirement in 1998.\n\nWhat he\u2019s looking for: \u201cA president who would essentially stick with the tenets of our Constitution and the will of the Founders, and not view government as a tool to manipulate the people, by taking from Paul to pay Peter \u2026 or the other way around. If I were God, I\u2019d mandate a balanced budget in conjunction with a flat tax.\u201d\n\n***\n\nTerry A. Gillham, 65, Austin, Texas. Gillham is a soon-to-be-retired accountant for a construction company. He and his wife, who moved to Texas from Kansas in 1993, are active in local and state politics and helped found a pro-life pregnancy center. He identifies himself as a Southern Baptist.\n\n\u201cI will vote for the Republican nominee even if I have to hold my nose while doing so,\u201d Gillham says, as he did for John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012\n\nWhat he\u2019s looking for: \u201cAmerica truly needs a solid conservative president with proven experience in government, where he/she has actually governed in a conservative style in close obedience to the Constitution.\u201d\n\nSomething he worries about: \u201cThe swarm of candidates makes it very difficult for any one person to shine significantly,\u201d and the party \u201chas proven unable\u2014unwilling?\u2014to support a real conservative,\u201d Gillham says, adding:\n\nThe nominee will need an overwhelming personal appeal to break out of the \u2018good ol\u2019 boys club\u2019 that nominated McCain and Romney and produced eight years of Obama.\n\n***\n\nRon Bowen, 77, Grand Blanc, Mich. A Navy veteran, Bowen recently retired after working for more than 46 years at a General Motors plant in Grand Blanc, a suburb of his native Flint, Mich., rising from die-maker apprentice to manager of quality systems implementation.\n\nSomething he worries about: \u201cI am just one of many others that are aware that everything Obama has done was planned. We do not buy into the conventional wisdom that his foreign policies anywhere have been a disaster due to his cluelessness.\n\nWe believe he has been wildly successful at doing what he wanted to do. America has been politically bio-engineered in small doses to progressive communism, but no one will call his policies that.\n\nWhat he\u2019s looking for: \u201cThe good news is that this journey into the dark tunnel of a country without the Constitution may be coming to an end. There is indeed light. The Republican bench is the best I have seen since Reagan.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "These older voters tell The Daily Signal what they're looking for as the Republican presidential debates begin.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "These older voters tell The Daily Signal what they're looking for as the Republican presidential debates begin.", "title": "11 Seasoned Conservatives in Search of a 2016 Nominee", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016votersFeature.png", "updated_time": "2015-08-08T14:13:55+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1Q860TY"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "These older voters tell The Daily Signal what they're looking for as the Republican presidential debates begin.", "title": "11 Seasoned Conservatives in Search of a 2016 Nominee", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016votersFeature.png"}, "creator": "@KenMac55", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-08-05T23:03:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-08T14:13:55+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "conservatives, conservative voters, conservative Republicans, presidential race, Fox debate, Cleveland debate, presidential debate, 2016 campaign, first presidential debate"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8be9\"", "article_summary": "Liberalism is slowly destroying all of these things, and big government is becoming a way of life even in the Republican Party.\nWhat he\u2019s looking for: \u201cI\u2019m looking for a candidate who believes in and fully supports the Constitution, American exceptionalism and the American people.\nWhat he\u2019s looking for: \u201cThe good news is that this journey into the dark tunnel of a country without the Constitution may be coming to an end.\nDoug Whaley, a 71-year-old retired salesman, says he is looking for a conservative candidate for president who is worthy of his trust.\nIt\u2019ll be another six months before the first votes of the 2016 primary season are cast in Iowa and New Hampshire."}
