At the open on Thursday night’s broadcast of MSNBC’s The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell, the host remarked that he was prepared to “make history” at the end of his broadcast. Earlier that evening, the host tweeted that he was prepared to issue a “fond farewell.”

UPDATE: “This is the last national prime time broadcast from NBC Burbank,” O’Donnell revealed. He noted that there has been a series of household names who have broadcast from those studios and that he was proud to have been a part of that tradition.

NBC is moving to the Universal Studios lot, now the NBCUniversal Lot, where O’Donnell will continue to broadcast.
