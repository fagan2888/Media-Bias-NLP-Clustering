This figure represents all enrollment from Oct. 1 through Feb. 1. It includes both people who have and have not paid their first month\u2019s premium. Of those people, 1,146,100 selected their health insurance plans in January, meaning there was a 53 percent increase enrollment last month alone.\n\nThis makes January the first month that the Obama administration has beaten an enrollment target. In September, way before HealthCare.gov\u2019s botched launch, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projected that 1,059,900 people would sign up for private health insurance in January.\n\nThe new enrollment figures also show a slight increase in the number of young adults signing up for coverage. Young adults between 18 and 35 made up 27 percent of the enrollees in January, compared to 24 percent of those signing up from October through December.\n\nTaken together, this means that 25 percent of those who have enrolled are the young adults that the Obama administration thinks will be healthier, and thus hold down insurance premiums in the exchanges. This is still below the 40 percent target that the Obama administration had previously set for overall exchange enrollment, although the hope, on their part, is that the 25 percent number continues to inch up in February and March.\n\nThe biggest takeaway here, probably, is that Obamacare is starting to look more and more like the law that the White House had hoped to launch \u2014 not the one where technical glitches made it nearly impossible for shoppers to get in the door.\n\nSource: washingtonpost.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Moving On Up. 3.3 Million People Signed Up For Obamacare", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Atlanta Black Star", "description": "Moving On Up. 3.3 Million People Signed Up For Obamacare", "title": "Moving On Up: 3.3 Million People Signed up For Obamacare - Atlanta Black Star", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 2801, "identifier": "http://atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/obamacare.jpg", "height": 1867}, "updated_time": "2014-02-12T19:38:31-04:00", "url": "http://atlantablackstar.com/2014/02/12/moving-3-3-million-people-signed-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Moving On Up. 3.3 Million People Signed Up For Obamacare", "creator": "@ATLBlackStar", "image": "http://atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/obamacare.jpg", "title": "Moving On Up: 3.3 Million People Signed up For Obamacare - Atlanta Black Star", "site": "@ATLBlackStar", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 423701050974928, "pages": 121768594624589}, "google-site-verification": "AI3aoX4BpxHiSZTUM0Y-VGd7D_TxvYe6B1taK2BPgVE", "msvalidate.01": "4554983016373594F75B74E82FB35D2E", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ATLBlackStar", "section": "Business", "tag": "obamacare results", "published_time": "2014-02-12T20:11:23-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-12T19:38:31-04:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb0ac\"", "article_summary": "The latest enrollment data from the Obama administration show that 3.3 million people have signed up for private health insurance through federal and state insurance exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act.\nThe new enrollment figures also show a slight increase in the number of young adults signing up for coverage.\nThis makes January the first month that the Obama administration has beaten an enrollment target.\nOf those people, 1,146,100 selected their health insurance plans in January, meaning there was a 53 percent increase enrollment last month alone.\nIn September, way before HealthCare.gov\u2019s botched launch, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projected that 1,059,900 people would sign up for private health insurance in January."}
