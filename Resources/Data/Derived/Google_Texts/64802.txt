The four skydivers from Denver Broncos Thunderstorm still hope to descend into Sports Authority Field before kickoff Sunday — if Mother Nature cooperates.

“It doesn’t look good,” said David Billings, who added that they’ll be grounded if winds surpass 15 mph.

With a forecast for Sunday of wind gusts reaching up to 50 mph, it’s unlikely Billings and his three teammates will get to jump, he said.

Nevertheless, they’ll be donning blue and orange jumpsuits and sitting near their headquarters at the Longmont airport before the Denver Broncos playoff game against the San Diego Chargers, just in case.

“We don’t plan to cancel anything until the deadline,” Billings said.

Billings, a veteran of more than 13,000 skydiving jumps, said his team has been landing into the Broncos’ stadium before games since 2009.

The had scheduled a test run Saturday but high winds made that impossible.

He has skydived in winds up to 45 mph, but for safety concerns the FAA won’t allow jumps into stadiums when the wind is above that 15 mph barrier, Billings said.

“It’s for safety on demonstration jumps,” he said. “There are a different set of rules.”
