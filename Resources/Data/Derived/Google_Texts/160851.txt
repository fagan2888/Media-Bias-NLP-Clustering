Negotiators between the U.S. and Iran have been ironing out a deal to keep Iran's nuclear program peaceful. But Congressman Gregg Harper says it's not a smart decision.

The deal calls for Iran to lower its stockpile of uranium and centrifuges. In exchange, the U.S. and European Union would lift sanctions against the country. But Congressman Harper says we should be focusing our energies on our ally in Israel instead, and he says the government should know better than to put its faith in Iran.

"Keep in mind, Iran is the largest state sponsor of terrorism around the world," he says. "And we're going to trust them to do the right thing?"

The president says there would be strict verification measures in place to make sure Iran complies with all the rules.
