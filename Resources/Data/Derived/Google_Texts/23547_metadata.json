CMS estimated that many of the providers already operate at a loss and so can continue to do so. \"That position is illogical,\" Dombi declared, arguing that \"the longer a business is in the red, the more likely it will close.\"\n\nAccording to the NAHC report, only three states will escape negative Medicare margins in the home health sector \u2013 Tennessee, Georgia, and Connecticut. Other states range from small losses, such as Rhode Island (0.2 percent) and Alabama (0.3 percent), to much more significant losses, like Alaska (48.3 percent), North Dakota (38.8 percent), and New York (36.3 percent).\n\n\"The factors that influence the cost per visit include staff productivity, staff travel time, and overhead costs,\" Dombi explained. \"In a densely populated state, staff may have only short travel distances between patients while in states like North Dakota and Alaska it may take 1-2 hours to travel between patients.\"\n\nRobert Moffit, senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation's Center for Health Policy Studies, explained that Obamacare has long been predicted to cut hospice services by $17 billion. \"This is the report delivered on July 24, 2012, by the Congressional Budget Office,\" Moffit explained. \"There's no excuse for people being surprised by any of this.\"\n\n\"A lot of these savings are going to be used to pay for the Obamacare expansions through Medicaid and the subsidy program,\" Moffit said, pointing to a \"shift of funding from Medicare to the entitlement expansions in Obamacare.\" In a report from May 2013, Moffit totaled the Medicare cuts due to ObamaCare \u2013 the number came to $716 billion.\n\n\"One thing is certain: Under the Obama agenda, seniors will pay more \u2013 much more \u2013 and they will pay this steep price in many different ways, including a loss of access to care resulting from demoralized doctors and other medical professionals cutting back on Medicare practice,\" Moffit wrote.\n\nThe Center for American Progress, a long-time supporter of the Affordable Care Act, did not return requests for comment by press time.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The sector of hospice and home care may
