Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy and the Episcopal Health Foundation (EHF) released a new report showing that as many as one out of four Texans lack confidence in defining various basic terms regarding health insurance plans.\n\nWith 25 percent of Texans unable to define terminology such as \u2018copayment,\u2019 \u2018premium,\u2019 or \u2018provider network,\u2019 the researchers from Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute and EHF found that the low-income, uninsured population of Latino descent was more likely to fall into this group, according to a press release from Rice University.\n\nThese surveys are meant to monitor the outcomes of implementing the Affordable Care Act as well as report on any health insurance coverage changes. Originally, the Health Reform Monitoring Survey reports were created by the Urban Institute, the Ford Foundation, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nPolled Texans answered questions about seven key terms related to health insurance plans in a survey to show their overall understanding of the insurance industry. The researchers uncovered some important differences among the different groups in the Texas population studied.\n\nFor example, those without coverage had little idea on what five of the seven terms about health insurance plans meant. A \u201clack of confidence\u201d in the terminology was twice as high among the uninsured respondents.\n\nOut of those who are uninsured, 70.3 percent are unaware of the term \u201cco-insurance\u201d and 62.1 percent are unsure of what the concepts \u201cprovider network\u201d and \u201ccovered services\u201d mean.\n\nPopulation groups that were more likely to lack healthcare coverage were continually found to have difficulty understanding some typical health insurance terminology. The Caucasian and African-American populations were less likely than the Hispanic groups to have trouble identifying the definition of specifications about health insurance plans.\n\nFor example, while only 15.1 percent of Caucasians were unable to identify what a \u201cpremium\u201d is, as many as 43.6 percent of Hispanics did not know what the term meant. This could very well be related to the fact that many of Latino descent are bilingual or may not speak English.\n\n\u201cAs Hispanics make up an increasingly larger share of the Texas population, it\u2019s critical that we consider their needs when developing and implementing policies about health insurance,\u201d Vivian Ho, the chair in health economics at Rice\u2019s Baker Institute and director of the institute\u2019s Center for Health and Biosciences, a professor of economics at Rice and a professor of medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, stated in the release.\n\nLow-income Texans also found it more challenging to define certain health insurance concepts. The researchers discovered in the report that more than 35 percent of polled Texans were unable to define \u201cmaximum out-of-pocket expenses\u201d while at least 45 percent had difficulty understanding term \u201ccoinsurance.\u201d\n\nAlmost one-third of those polled \u2013 30 percent \u2013 had trouble understanding the concepts \u201cprovider network\u201d and \u201ccovered services.\u201d Ever since the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act became operational through the health insurance exchange, Elena Marks, EHF\u2019s President and CEO and a Nonresident Health Policy Fellow at the Baker Institute, alongside of Vivian Ho of Rice\u2019s Baker Institute partnered to put out the Health Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS) every quarter starting in 2013.\n\n\u201cThis research shows that understanding the key parts of a health insurance plan can be tough, especially for the uninsured,\u201d Elena Marks said in a public statement. \u201cThese numbers illustrate the continuing need to offer education and outreach targeting the uninsured so they can better understand their health insurance options.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven among those with insurance, many lacked confidence in aspects of employer-provided insurance that have changed dramatically over the past several years,\u201d Marks continued. \u201cWorkers are paying larger portions of premiums, deductibles and copays. They need to fully understand how these changes can influence their out-of-pocket spending on health care.\u201d\n\nThe Baker Institute and the Episcopal Health Foundation are working together to report on any major changes ever since the Affordable Care Act expanded medical coverage among the citizens of Texas due to tax subsidies offered through the health insurance exchange along with other key provisions of Obamacare. For example, young adults under 26 years of age are allowed to remain on their parents\u2019 health insurance plans.\n\nThe surveys focus on defining healthcare access, affordability of medical spending, self-reported health outcomes, and healthcare coverage issues. This particular survey shows that 23.5 percent of those polled are unaware of what the term \u201cco-payment\u201d means while 27.2 percent lack understanding of the word \u201cpremium.\u201d\n\nObamacare brought a tidal wave of changes to the health insurance industry, which led to as many as 20 million more Americans to enter the market and purchase medical coverage. This was done through Medicaid expansion, employer-sponsored health plans, and the insurance marketplace. With the healthcare coverage increasing in Texas to include an additional 5 percent of people, it grows more important than ever before for insured individuals to understand the terminology of the health insurance field.\n\nSince 1.3 million Texans purchased coverage through the federal health insurance exchange, it is important to educate consumers on the definitions of terminology in order to ensure they are making the right financial decisions for their medical care and insurance purchasing.\n\nHealth insurance companies along with state and federal agencies will need to work further to educate consumers on important medical coverage terms and ensure these individuals are making the best decision regarding their healthcare spending.\n\nImage Credits: Rice University's Baker Institute and Episcopal Health Foundation", "article_metadata": {"description": "New research shows that consumer education in terms of health insurance plans is becoming a necessity since many are unaware of some typical insurance terms.", "author": "HealthPayerIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/news/25-of-texans-lack-knowledge-about-health-insurance-plans", "type": "article", "image": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Texas_Flag.jpg", "site_name": "HealthPayerIntelligence", "title": "25% of Texans Lack Knowledge about Health Insurance Plans"}, "twitter": {"description": "New research shows that consumer education in terms of health insurance plans is becoming a necessity since many are unaware of some typical insurance terms.", "title": "25% of Texans Lack Knowledge about Health Insurance Plans", "image": {"src": "http://healthpayerintelligence.com/images/site/articles/Texas_Flag.jpg"}, "creator": "@", "site": "@", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "msvalidate.01": "A4BC83422766F1B550D1E340B290BAC0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "New research shows that consumer education in terms of health insurance plans and healthcare access is becoming a necessity since many are unaware of some typical health insurance terms.\nThese surveys are meant to monitor the outcomes of implementing the Affordable Care Act as well as report on any health insurance coverage changes.\nFor example, young adults under 26 years of age are allowed to remain on their parents\u2019 health insurance plans.\nPolled Texans answered questions about seven key terms related to health insurance plans in a survey to show their overall understanding of the insurance industry.\nThe Caucasian and African-American populations were less likely than the Hispanic groups to have trouble identifying the definition of specifications about health insurance plans."}
