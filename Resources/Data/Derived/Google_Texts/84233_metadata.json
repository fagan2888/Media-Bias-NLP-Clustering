So, she noted, it was a significant savings for a plan that all her doctors accept and has lower co-pays.\n\n\u2014\n\nLeonard Bonarek had a similar experience:\n\n\u201cI was eligible for a subsidy that allowed me to purchase coverage for 15 cents a month,\u201d he said.\n\nVickie Goffredo of Organizing For America, the rally sponsor, says the Obama administration may not reach its goal of six million new enrollees by March 31st, but she doesn\u2019t think that matters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just really good to sign up and get health care. I mean, that\u2019s the bottom line. We just want to get people covered,\u201d she told KYW Newsradio t0day.\n\nAfter the deadline, signup will close until October, except for those with life-changing events, such as a job loss.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Philadelphia has one of the highest rates of signup, but advocates are not resting until the March 31st deadline passes.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2014/03/18/organizers-urging-philadelphians-to-beat-obamacare-signup-deadline/", "image": {"width": 625, "secure_url": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/fattah-aca-_loeb.jpg?w=625", "identifier": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/fattah-aca-_loeb.jpg?w=625", "height": 352}, "type": "article", "description": "Philadelphia has one of the highest rates of signup, but advocates are not resting until the March 31st deadline passes.", "title": "Organizers Urging Philadelphians To Beat Obamacare Signup Deadline"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/fattah-aca-_loeb.jpg?w=625", "description": "Philadelphia has one of the highest rates of signup, but advocates are not resting until the March 31st deadline passes.", "site": "CBSphilly", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Organizers Urging Philadelphians To Beat Obamacare Signup Deadline"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Philly's Top Spots", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Philly", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly"}, "keywords": "affordable care act, chaka fattah, healthcare.gov, kyw newsradio 1060, leonard bonarek, love park, obamacare, organizing for america, pat loeb, susan o'connell, vickie goffredo aca information, affordable care act, business & economy, community, consumer news, government, health, heard on, local, news, philadelphia, syndicated local", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/40f9fbf792243f0932e0cab4dbd46d10?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, chaka fattah, healthcare.gov, kyw newsradio 1060, leonard bonarek, love park, obamacare, organizing for america, pat loeb, susan o'connell, vickie goffredo"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf735\"", "article_summary": "Today, a signup rally in Love Park (JFK Plaza) featured elected officials and the newly insured, who testified to the \u201caffordable\u201d part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just really good to sign up and get health care.\nPhiladelphia has one of the highest rates of signup, but advocates are not resting until the March 31st deadline passes.\nAfter the deadline, signup will close until October, except for those with life-changing events, such as a job loss.\nBy Pat LoebPHILADELPHIA (CBS) \u2014 Federal officials have announced that more than five million people have now enrolled in a health insurance plan through the Affordable Care Act web site, healthcare.gov."}
