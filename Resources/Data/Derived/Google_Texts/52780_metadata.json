These categories account for approximately 75 percent of Medicare fee-for-service patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation, according to the statement.\n\nThe overall 30-day readmission rate among patients discharged from rehabilitative services was 11.8 percent, according to the study. Of the six categories, debility had the highest readmission rate with 18.8 percent, while lower extremity joint replacement had the lowest, with 5.8 percent.\n\nReadmission rates were similar between rural and urban facilities and between freestanding and hospital-based facilities, and ranged between 9.2 percent and 13.6 percent geographically. Michigan had the highest rates, while Idaho and Washington state had the lowest, according to the statement.\n\nDespite the amount of data, researchers said it was not enough to draw clear conclusions about the relationship between rehab facilities and readmissions. \"Further research is needed to understand the causes of readmission,\" the authors wrote.\n\nPressure is mounting for IRFs to improve readmission rates. This fiscal year, the CMS will add 30-day readmissions to the national quality indicators for such facilities, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study abstract\n\n- read the statement\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nRehab facilities facing new quality reporting requirements\n\nHospital readmission rates heading in the right direction\n\nHospital-community collaboration reduced readmissions by 4,750\n\nMedicare slaps two-thirds of US hospitals with readmission penalties", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than one in 10 Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), according to a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "More than one in 10 Medicare patients are readmitted within 30 days after discharge from inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs), according to a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.", "title": "Hospital 30-day readmission rates vary after inpatient rehabilitation", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/hospital-30-day-readmission-rates-vary-after-inpatient-rehabilitation/2014-02-12", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "30-day readmissions,inpatient rehabilitation facility,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,strokes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc302\"", "article_summary": "Pressure is mounting for IRFs to improve readmission rates.\nReadmission rates were similar between rural and urban facilities and between freestanding and hospital-based facilities, and ranged between 9.2 percent and 13.6 percent geographically.\nThese categories account for approximately 75 percent of Medicare fee-for-service patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation, according to the statement.\nThe overall 30-day readmission rate among patients discharged from rehabilitative services was 11.8 percent, according to the study.\nThe study represents the first such research on reasons for post-rehab readmissions, according to a statement from the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston."}
