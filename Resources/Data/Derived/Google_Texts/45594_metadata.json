Progressives tend to focus on process issues, and these new IRS regulations are a direct attempt by the political left to rewrite the rules of political engagement unfairly in their favor.\u201d\n\nLast week, the IRS scandal deepened when the Washington Times reported the Justice Department selected Barbara Kay Bosserman, a DOJ trial lawyer, who had contributed to Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012 as well as to the Democratic Party, to lead the criminal probe into the IRS targeting conservative groups to deny their applications for tax-exempt status.\n\nMitchell in her discussions with conservative groups has explained the activities the IRS seeks to define as \u201ccandidate-related political activities,\u201d subject to taxation and reporting to the IRS, are basic 501(c)4 activities such as grassroots lobbying, candidate forums, candidate debates, voter registration drives, voter guides and issue advocacy.\n\n\u201cThe IRS is fully aware this is a war in which conservative groups are being targeted,\u201d Mitchell explains, noting the proposed IRS new rules do not apply to labor unions or trade associations. \u201cThe Obama administration is not looking for ways to restrain labor unions from using member dues to conduct similar activities.\u201d\n\nHistorically, labor union political support has gone to Democratic Party political candidates since the end of World War II, while the upsurge in tax-exempt filings have come from conservatives and especially from the many tea-party groups formed since the economic downturn dating back to 2008.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 \u201cNon-profit groups must prepare to fight back [against] the IRS on yet a second front,\u201d warns Cleta Mitchell, a partner in the Washington-based law firm Foley & Lardner LLP, well-known for providing expert legal advise to conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status.
