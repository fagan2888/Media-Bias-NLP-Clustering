Close to 300,000 people in Orlando-Daytona Beach-Melbourne area have selected a plan or automatically enrolled in one in the health insurance Marketplace as of Jan. 9, federal officials said on Wednesday.

This puts Central Florida in second place for the number of ACA enrollees after Miami-Ft. Lauderdale market.

Some 1.6 million people in Florida have signed up for coverage through healthcare.gov or have been automatically re-enrolled in their last year's plan. The national total is 8.7 million, Health and Human Services officials said.

"Consumers have only two days left before the January 15 deadline to sign up for coverage starting February 1," HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a news release. "We are focused on educating customers about the affordable options at HealthCare.gov and providing them the help they need to make the best coverage choices."

The final deadline for open enrollment is January 31st.
