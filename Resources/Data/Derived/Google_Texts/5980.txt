The Broncos waived wide receiver Nathan Palmer from their active roster and signed tight end Dominique Jones to their practice squad, the team announced Tuesday.

Jones (6-foot-3, 270 pounds) is a third-year player who has appeared in 12 career games (three starts) with the Indianapolis Colts (2012-13) and Kansas City Chiefs (2013), totaling three receptions for 42 yards.

Signed by the Colts as a college free agent on April 30, 2012, Jones also spent a portion of his rookie season on the Miami Dolphins practice squad and most recently competed with the Buffalo Bills during the preseason in 2014.

Jones played with the Reading Express of the Indoor Football League and the Sacramento Mountain Lions of the United Football League following his collegiate career at Shepherd University.
