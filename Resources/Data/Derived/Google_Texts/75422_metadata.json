The season of goodwill, giving and family morphs rapidly into that of neurotic self-improvement and fitness plans. January is the month when we strive to confront some of our most disquieting questions: Who do I want to be? What do I wish to look like? Which of my habits do I hope to cast aside?\n\nMarketers have always sought to ensure that our full range of ethical needs can be satisfied through spending money. Both altruism and egoism are fertile territory for selling more products and services. It goes without saying that Christmas represents a commercial nirvana. But there is also a particular affinity between consumer culture and that January dream of self-transformation.\n\nEver since advertising agencies first studied how to prompt specific emotions during the 1920s, anxieties about self-improvement have been deliberately cultivated by capitalism. The \u2018new year, new me\u2019 mindset of January is a rich opportunity for those wishing to sell us stuff. Our dietary pledges and lifestyle goals leave us vulnerable to the most idealistic advertising messages regarding who we might become over the next year.\n\nYet there are certain features of today\u2019s marketplace and culture that add an extra bite to the business end of self-transformation, which have only emerged in the last few years.\n\nFirstly, things have become a lot more technological and scientific. In the past, New Years\u2019 resolutions were fundamentally ethical pledges regarding the life one would like to live. They were like marriage vows made to one-self. \u201cI promise to be a person who doesn\u2019t smoke.\u201d \u201cI commit to drinking more water.\u201d In the absence of any other party to be faithful to, such vows tend to dissolve relatively quickly.\n\nToday, however, we live in the age of smart and wearable technologies, whose purpose is to convert self-transformation from an ethical project into a scientific one. In the process, we outsource much of the mental strain of self-control to machines. Technologies such as the \u2018smart cup\u2019 Vessyl, which \u201cautomatically knows and tracks everything you drink,\u201d provide data on what we\u2019ve been putting in our bodies.\n\nThe \u2018quantified self movement,\u2019 which began as an experimental project of digitally tracking anything from one\u2019s nutrition to one\u2019s sex-life, has become big business, now that Fitbits, Jawbones and smart watches collect data on bodily behavior and movement. The chief innovations of the iPhone 6, released in September, were apps which monitor physical activity and health behaviors.\n\nIf Silicon Valley venture capitalists are even half right, the next five years will see a flood of new gadgets, wearable technologies and apps aimed at monitoring and reporting how we (principally our bodies, brains and credit cards) are behaving, from one minute to the next. In that respect, early-January neurosis \u2014 am I being the person I\u2019d like to be? \u2014 is now becoming the normal condition of the digital technology user, throughout the year. Extensive new technological infrastructures are being built simply to nurture and answer that one lonely question, only now with quantitative data. Our anxiety is their revenue opportunity.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Silicon Valley is betting big that wearable technology will keep us in a state of January neurosis all year long", "author": "William Davies", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Silicon Valley is betting big that wearable technology will keep us in a state of January neurosis all year long", "title": "New Year\u2019s resolutions are a scam: Your anxiety makes the 1 percent mega-millions", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/01/new_years_resolutions_are_a_scam_your_anxiety_makes_the_1_percent_mega_millions/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/businessman_money.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Silicon Valley is betting big that wearable technology will keep us in a state of January neurosis all year long", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/businessman_money.jpg", "title": "New Year\u2019s resolutions are a scam: Your anxiety makes the 1 percent mega-millions", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "New Year\u2019s resolutions are a scam: Your anxiety makes the 1 percent mega-millions", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1 percent, Editor's Picks, fitbits, iPhones, new years resolutions, William Davies", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf64a\"", "article_summary": "In the past, New Years\u2019 resolutions were fundamentally ethical pledges regarding the life one would like to live.\nToday, however, we live in the age of smart and wearable technologies, whose purpose is to convert self-transformation from an ethical project into a scientific one.\nExtensive new technological infrastructures are being built simply to nurture and answer that one lonely question, only now with quantitative data.\nJanuary is the month when we strive to confront some of our most disquieting questions: Who do I want to be?\nMarketers have always sought to ensure that our full range of ethical needs can be satisfied through spending money."}
