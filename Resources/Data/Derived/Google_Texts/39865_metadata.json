Kathleen Sebelius earlier this year to promote Obamacare has been charged with wire fraud in connection with an $8 million mortgage scheme.\n\nLucie Tondreau, who has been marred by scandal since she was elected mayor of North Miami last year, will be charged in the conspiracy alongside three other suspects.\n\nAccording to the indictment, between 2005 and 2008, Tondreau conspired with the president of a South Florida mortgage company to recruit straw borrowers to obtain mortgages.\n\nTondreau and the mortgage company president aired advertisements on a radio show that they hosted to help prop up the scheme, the indictment alleges. The duo \u201crecruited and paid some of the listeners who responded to those advertisements, as well as other individuals, to pose as borrowers to purchase properties\u201d.\n\nThe indictment also alleges that the co-conspirators fabricated HUD-1 Settlement forms which misrepresented that straw borrowers had made down payments and closing payments on homes.\n\nThe fraudulent loans were made for 20 properties.\n\nIn February, Tondreau, North Miami\u2019s first Haitian-American mayor, helped the Obama administration and HHS Sec. Kathleen Sebelius promote Obamacare. Both spoke at a National Youth Enrollment Day event to increase awareness of Obamacare among young people six weeks before the March 31 sign-up deadline.\n\nEven before Monday\u2019s indictment and February\u2019s appearance with Sebelius, Tondreau was the center of another fraud probe.\n\nLast year, Florida state prosecutors linked requests for 60 absentee ballots to an Internet address from Tondreau\u2019s office. Tondreau denied any wrongdoing in that case. Tondreau\u2019s campaign treasurer was discovered with the pile of absentee ballots in his vehicle. Florida law allows only individual voters or family members of voters to request absentee ballots.\n\nTondreau defeated then-mayor Kevin Burns with nearly 60 percent of the vote last June.\n\nTondreau\u2019s pending arrest marks another in a flurry of recent fraud cases against local and state Democratic politicians.\n\nPatrick Cannon, the mayor of Charlotte, N.C., was recently arrested for taking bribes from undercover FBI agents. California state Sen. Leland Yee was arrested in March for wire fraud and conspiracy to deal illegal firearms.\n\nFollow Chuck on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Chuck Ross", "description": "The mayor of North Miami was charged with wire fraud Monday for ads she ran on a radio show to sell mortgages.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "A Democratic mayor who appeared alongside U.S. Health and Human Services Sec.
