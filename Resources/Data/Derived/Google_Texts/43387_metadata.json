Simply put, they are dealing cocaine, using paid informants to lure in desperate wanna-be \u201cmiddle men\u201d from across the country with the promise of profits for their involvement in the drug trade, then arresting these people and taking all their belongings:\n\nUndercover detectives and their army of informants lure big-money drug buyers into the city from across the United States, and from as far north as Canada and as far south as Peru. They negotiate the sale of kilos of cocaine in popular family restaurants, then bust the buyers and seize their cash and cars. Police confiscate millions from these deals, money that fuels huge overtime payments for the undercover officers who conduct the drug stings and cash rewards for the confidential informants who help detectives entice faraway buyers, a six-month Sun Sentinel investigation found. Police have paid one femme fatale informant more than $800,000 over the past five years for her success in drawing drug dealers into the city, records obtained by the newspaper show.\n\nSome relevant bullet-points:\n\nThe police set up the deal locations where the busts take place, not the alleged crooks. They are the ones arranging potentially dangerous confrontations outside of places like McDonald\u2019s and T.G.I. Friday\u2019s, where people take their families:\n\nIn a 2010 deposition, one defense attorney asked a Sunrise cop: \u201cWould you take your wife shopping in that plaza if you knew a deal was going down that afternoon?\u201d The reply: \u201cProbably not.\u201d\n\nOnly seven of the 190 arrests from these operations since 2009 were of people who lived in Sunrise. All the rest were lured into the city from elsewhere by this operation.\n\nForfeiture cases are frequently decided before criminal cases are even resolved. For example, Sunrise has been awarded $23,000 in cash from one of these busts even though the criminal case hasn\u2019t even yet gone to trial.\n\nOf all the busts in this operation, only two received the mandatory-minimum 15-year sentence for actual cocaine trafficking. Despite police claims, they do not appear to be snagging big drug war players, and the juries are realizing it:\n\nSunrise police, in many of their affidavits and arrest reports, state that they are apprehending significant members of drug trafficking organizations who want large sources of cocaine to expand their illegal businesses. But those same reports quote culprits saying they were recruited to be lookouts or mules or brokers \u2014 middlemen earning only hundreds or a few thousand dollars to deliver the money or collect the cocaine. Defense attorneys say the stings have swept up people who are not in the drug trade but are down on their luck, persuaded by informants to do a deal to earn fast money in hard times. Sunrise informants \u201ctend to go after people who they know are in financial distress and they offer them a deal that they can\u2019t resist,\u201d said Broward defense attorney Kevin Kulik, who has represented defendants arrested in Sunrise stings. \u201cThey offer them the deal of a lifetime.\u201d\n\nOne of Kulik\u2019s clients busted in these reverse stings was an unemployed real estate agent who had filed for bankruptcy in 2009. Now he has even less, obviously.\n\nMost of the detectives in the narcotics unit are pulling in annual overtime payments in the five figures. One sergeant has pulled in $240,000 in overtime in three-and-a-half years. His total compensation during this time frame was $630,000.\n\nThere is so much more in the Sun Sentinel\u2019s very thorough reporting. Reporters reviewed hundreds of documents and had to sue the city to get some information. Read the whole story here and how they got it here. In April, the newspaper won a Pulitzer prize for detailing widespread and dangerous speeding by southern Florida law enforcement officials. Looks like they\u2019re angling for another one.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Small agency lures folks in from elsewhere in order to arrest them, take all their stuff", "title": "Sunrise, Fla., Cops Take Forfeiture Abuse to the Next Level by Becoming Cocaine Dealers", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2013/10/08/sunrise-fla-cops-take-forfeiture-abuse-t", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13812469627522.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Remarkable reporting from the\nSun Sentinel of Broward County in Florida details the\namazing lengths the narcotics unit of Sunrise, Fla., (population:\n88,843) pursue in order to rake in both overtime and the revenue\nfrom seizing property.
