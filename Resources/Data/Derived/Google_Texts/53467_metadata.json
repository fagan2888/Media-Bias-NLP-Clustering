Turns out, they actually apply to the Environmental Protection Agency too.\n\nThat\u2019s at least according to three Congressmembers who on Tuesday used Gruber\u2019s controversial comments to argue for a bill that would encourage more industry representation on the agency\u2019s Science Advisory Board (SAB), the body that makes sure the EPA\u2019s regulations are based on sound science. Proponents of the bill argue this would increase transparency at the EPA, because it also puts numerous public reporting requirements on the agency when choosing its scientific advisers.\n\nReps. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Andy Harris (R-MD), and Randy Weber (R-TX) said Gruber\u2019s comments represented a lack of transparency in the Obama Administration that has manifested itself within the EPA.\n\nThe Congressmembers\u2019 comments come a couple days after videos surfaced of Gruber saying that the President\u2019s health care law only succeeded because of a lack of political transparency in the Obama administration, and \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter\u201d \u2014 comments which are demonstrably false. However, conservatives have since then been running with the story, deeming it \u201cGruberGate,\u201d a representation that the Obama Administration thinks big government knows best.\n\nNow, the talking point seems to be extending to policy areas beyond health care. Case in point, the three Congressmembers who used Gruber\u2019s comments to argue in support of the EPA bill. Watch them here:\n\nThe bill\u2019s opponents say the reform would do nothing to increase transparency of the EPA, and instead \u201cstack the board\u201d with industry representatives while making it more difficult for real academics to serve. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX) also noted that the bill passed committee without a single Democratic vote, which gave Rep. Weber the first opportunity to bring Gruber into the conversation.\n\n\u201cIt almost sounds like the Affordable Care Act to me, where recently revelations are one of the proponents said Americans were too stupid to understand,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s why the Affordable Care Act had to be passed, and it couldn\u2019t have transparency because it would never pass Congress.\u201d\n\nNext up was Rep. Harris, who piggybacked off Weber\u2019s comments to defend the EPA bill. \u201cWe know fully and truly, as the gentleman from Texas said, because of the revelations of Mr. Gruber, that transparency is not a major objective of the administration, and I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s filtered down to the EPA,\u201d he said.\n\nRep. Blackburn agreed. \u201cI guess GruberGate has gone government-wide,\u201d she said \u201cAnd what we are seeing is [the EPA is] l trying to find ways to squirrel this away and hide, and not have that transparency.\u201d\n\nThe Gruber talking point is just one more on a long list of talking points House Republicans use to argue for more restrictions over how the EPA crafts its regulations, the most prominent of which is that the EPA uses \u201csecret science\u201d to craft its environmental regulations on power plants and other industrial sources. Indeed, conservatives have been waging a campaign accusing the EPA of using \u201csecret science\u201d for nearly twenty years. In reality, however, aside from patient information on test subjects, the peer-reviewed research the EPA uses to craft its regulations is readily available to anyone who wants to read it.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "\"GruberGate has gone government-wide,\" said Rep.
