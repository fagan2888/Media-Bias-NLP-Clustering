A tough phrase, granted, but one that can be imminently corrected.\n\nThink about this scenario about the church, writ large, and persecuted Christian believers in the Middle East \u2014 many concerns, much ecclesiastical consternation. Yet how often is that concern for the persecuted actually put into action? We hear, say, the plight of Pastor Saeed Abedini who has been imprisoned upwards of three years in an Iranian prison in Tehran \u2014 and has four more years to go in his unjust sentence, if he survives the regular beatings and the threats from fellow prisoners who do not share his viewpoint of Jesus being the Messiah and Savior of the world.\n\nIn an online petition at beheardproject.com, more than 1.1 million people have added their names to a list advocating for and demanding that Saeed be released. Is this a faith action \u201cwith works?\u201d\n\nThis season of thanks, giving and holidays, our \u201cFaith under Fire\u201d humbly offers suggestions to assist persecuted believers which require efforts that go beyond on line petition signing.\n\n1. You can pray. Pray daily for the Persecuted Church. Be aware of who is being persecuted and pray specifically.\n\n2. You can fast. Fasting is a lost \u201cfaith action\u201d that requires a believer to deny themselves. (Think St. Matthew 16:24 and St. Luke 9:23.) The abstention from food reminds the hungry believer of those who are being persecuted, not having enough to eat and perhaps in prison for their faith \u2014 and it allows the \u201cfaster\u201d to identify with the one being persecuted. Does your pastor/church leaders encourage biblical fasting for the persecuted? (See \u201cGod\u2019s Chosen Fast by Arthur Wallis.\u201d)\n\n3. You can give money. There are several organizations worldwide that advocate for those being killed and persecuted for their faith.\n\n4. You can go. This is the call that Jesus Christ gives to his followers in Matthew 28: \u201cGo\u2026\u201d A simple two-letter word that some claim needs to be accompanied by \u201ca calling.\u201d But Jesus adds no further comment other than to \u201cgo.\u201d\n\nThe going troubles many and it has troubled this columnist. In a personal way two years ago, I juxtaposed the \u201cgoing\u201d with the \u201cdead faith\u201d axiom and I thought, \u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d with an emphasis on the \u201cdoing.\u201d\n\nI thought of Saeed, his wife and children: \u201cIf I was Saeed, what would I want someone to do?\u201d For me, the answer was simple: I would want someone to come and rescue me \u2014 or at least make an attempt to rescue me. That introspective God-thought led me to apply for an Iranian visa, and after waiting 11 months, the visa was granted by the Iranian authorities and I booked a flight to Tehran. After eight days of meetings and connecting with several high-profile leaders both within and outside the Iranian government, my efforts to obtain the release of Saeed evaporated like dust in the wind.\n\nFailure? I wouldn\u2019t call this attempt a failure but rather an \u201ceffort to put my own personal faith into action.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s a sidebar. To one Iranian authority, I offered this: \u201cIf you will release Saeed, I will offer myself as his replacement in the prison. If you release him, I will serve out the remaining years of his sentence.\u201d This official rejected my plea and, sadly, I left Iran without a freed Saeed.\n\nThe night before I left, my wife and I were praying and upon concluding our prayers for Saeed and his family, our five kids and four grandchildren, she asked, \u201cSo what is the plan?\u201d I replied, \u201cYou\u2019ll either see me in two weeks or five years.\u201d\n\nFor this pastor, faith without works is really dead.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Faith-oriented people often hear the oft-repeated phrase: \"Faith without works is dead.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Faith-oriented people often hear the oft-repeated phrase: \u201cFaith without works is dead.\u201d", "title": "FAITH UNDER FIRE: The persecuted church and people of faith", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/27/faith-under-fire-persecuted-church-and-people-fait/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/02/d5b3abc5a2ad3f18780f6a7067009673.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/02/d5b3abc5a2ad3f18780f6a7067009673.jpg", "description": "Faith-oriented people often hear the oft-repeated phrase: \"Faith without works is dead.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "FAITH UNDER FIRE: The persecuted church and people of faith"}, "Author": "Bill Devlin", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Religion Belief, Jesus Christ, Saeed Abedini, Tehran"}, "article_summary": "faith, if that someone does not act on said belief, then that person\u2019s faith belief is said to be dead or non-existent.\nThink about this scenario about the church, writ large, and persecuted Christian believers in the Middle East \u2014 many concerns, much ecclesiastical consternation.\nThere are several organizations worldwide that advocate for those being killed and persecuted for their faith.\nIs this a faith action \u201cwith works?\u201dThis season of thanks, giving and holidays, our \u201cFaith under Fire\u201d humbly offers suggestions to assist persecuted believers which require efforts that go beyond on line petition signing.\nFaith-oriented people often hear the oft-repeated phrase: \u201cFaith without works is dead.\u201d This phrase, taken from the New Testament book of St. James, basically says, If someone believes something, i.e."}
