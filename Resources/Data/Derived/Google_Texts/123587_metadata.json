As The Atlantic\u2019s own Jeffrey Goldberg wrote recently , \u201cMy position on this is simple: If, in the post-Holocaust world, a group of people express a desire to hurt Jews, it is, for safety\u2019s sake, best to believe them.\u201d This has been the consistent theme of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin (\u201cBibi\u201d) Netanyahu\u2019s speeches as well, and its emotional and psychological logic is undeniable.\n\nRecognizing that the cairn-building is reaching its useful end, and while taking a break from my article-writing duties of the moment, let me introduce three more reader messages on Iran. All bear on an aspect of the debate I\u2019ve mentioned before but keep coming back to.\n\nRobert Hunter, a former ambassador and longtime foreign-policy eminence, has written that the Iran debate has reached the familiar \u201ccairn-building\u201d stage. That\u2019s the stage in which each side adds a new rock\u2014of argument, endorsement, rebuttal\u2014to the piled-up cairn it has created. \u201cThe merits of the arguments are politically meaningless,\u201d Hunter says. \u201cThe side with the highest pile of stones wins!\u201d But as he goes on to say, these piles themselves also become meaningless. All that matters is what actually weighs on the senators and representatives who will cast up or down votes.\n\nBut the strategic logic of the concern is more puzzling. No one doubts (although no officials can publicly say) that Israel has a large nuclear-retaliatory force, including on submarines. Thus any leader in Iran knows that an attack on Israel would with 100-percent certainty mean devastation for Iran as well (as Thomas Friedman went into on Wednesday). So to think that Iran might actually try to \u201cwipe Israel off the map\u201d requires assuming either that its leadership is literally suicidal, or that, like the Nazis in Germany, Iranian leaders are so bent on destruction that nothing other than brute force can hold them back.\n\nThe problem with the suicidal martyr-state assumption is that never in its 36-plus years in office has the Iranian leadership taken a move that rashly jeopardized its own well-being or hold on power. Iran\u2019s leadership has been theocratic but not psychopathic. A serious problem for the United States, Israel, and others: yes. A Reich-like monster-state: no. Under its Islamic leaders, Iran has been at war once\u2014a war that Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq started when it invaded Iran in 1980. So the \u201cexistential\u201d argument would be stronger were there any evidence of Iran\u2019s leaders ever taking suicidal risks.\n\nAs for the comparison with Nazi Germany, last week Peter Beinart carefully laid out the reasons that modern Iran and Hitler\u2019s Reich have exactly one point in common: their anti-Semitic rhetoric. In every other strategic, political, and military dimension they are completely different.\n\nI am sure that officials in Israel\u2019s security and military services realize this. Perhaps even Netanyahu does as well. So what lies behind the over-the-top claims?\n\nThat is what these posts address. The first is from Samuel J. Cohen, who was born in the United States and graduated from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies but has lived in Israel since 1977. For 20 years he was a trade negotiator for the Israeli government. He argues that the U.S. government under Obama and the Israeli government under Netanyahu may both be sanely pursuing their national interests, but that these interests may be diverging.\n\nCould Obama and Netanyahu Both Be Right? For Barak Obama, accepting the international agreement with Iran to limit their nuclear activities is a \u201cno brainer\u201d: \u201cas President of the United States it would be an abrogation of my constitutional obligations\u201d to defer to Israel on the Iran Deal. For Benjamin Netanyahu: \u201cthis is a very dangerous deal and it threatens all of us. My solemn responsibility as Prime Minister is to make sure Israel\u2019s concerns are heard.\u201d From my vantage post in Herzliya, I am struck by a question that most seem to be avoiding: Could Obama and Netanyahu both be right? Could it be that this deal is very good for the US (and the world)\u2014and not so good for Israel? For the United States and its international partners (China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Germany) the deal, at best removes, and at worst delays, Iran\u2019s development and acquisition of a nuclear weapon. A nuclear weapon capability for Iran not only insures Iran\u2019s regional hegemony and its ability to withstand western military threats, but, in extremis, poses a direct threat to Russian and European homelands.\n\n\u201cCould it be that this deal is very good for the US (and the world)\u2014and not so good for Israel?\u201d\n\nMoreover, the deal expresses the intention that Iran will actually set aside its plans to develop a nuclear weapon. Iran remains a non-nuclear weapon signatory of the NPT. It will be subject to the most rigorous inspection system of any NPT signatory. If Iran abides by the agreement, all is well. If it cheats, the US and its international partners have dramatically increased their ability to detect those violations, and can then either reinstate extreme sanctions or take very aggressive military action. In order to obtain Iran\u2019s nominal acceptance of the deal, the 5+1 are pledged to dismantle trade sanctions maintained against Iran. Actually, it\u2019s the international partners who will dismantle almost all trade sanctions; the U.S. will maintain significant sanctions against Iran, and will withhold diplomatic recognition, because of Iran\u2019s support of terrorism around the world. For the Europeans, for Russia and China, and for other nations that have maintained sanctions against Iran (e.g. Japan, Korea,) the end of sanctions is a very easy concession to make. Just look at the smiles of the European trade delegations that have already gone to Teheran. Truth to tell, some US exporters and banks may also find an economic benefit in the reduction of sanctions against Iran. Undoubtedly, this agreement will strengthen Iran\u2019s economy and allow their extreme Islamist regime to continue supporting terrorist activities around the world, bolster their support of Bashir al Assad in Syria and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and rebels in Yemen. It may or may not increase the repression of human rights and women\u2019s rights in Iran. We can assume that Iran will continue to be a really bad actor all over. But this agreement will drastically reduce, and may eliminate, the possibility that this bad actor will hold a nuclear weapon in its pocket. In the starkest context: if there were no Jewish State of Israel, and no Sunni Arabs in Jordan or Saudi Arabia, could anyone muster anything close to a majority in the U.S. Congress to oppose this deal? From Jerusalem, the view is different. We are looking at a deal that will strengthen the Iranian economy and reduce internal pressure on the current despotic regime. We have trouble hearing the distinctions between those Iranian leaders who actively want to destroy Israel, and the students who reportedly are bussed into demonstrations and paid to shout \u201cDeath to America.\u201d We have felt at close hand the Hezbollah missiles bought by Iran screaming into Israel in 2006. This year we can see the smoke from Assad\u2019s army that Iran supports in Syria. We had friends and relatives in the Jewish community building in Buenos Aries that Iran blew up in 1994. Iran is the bad guy in our neighborhood. For Israel, the possibility of a nuclear weapon in Teheran is, of course, a threat of a different magnitude. In extremis, a Persian bomb could destroy, totally, the Zionist State and the Jewish people. (It would also render the Palestinian issue moot.) But we have a very long way to go before we come to that. And as everyone keeps telling us, a nuclear armed Iran is a danger not to the Middle East, but to the whole world. So, that\u2019s somebody else\u2019s problem. In the meantime, we have the \u201cconventional\u201d conflict. This deal will strengthen Iran\u2019s ability, and perhaps its motivation, to make trouble continually and painfully in our neighborhood. And Israel will pay the price. And so the different conclusions in Washington and Jerusalem.\n\n\u201cIt is not easy for us to accept that Israel\u2019s interests may objectively differ from the interests of the United States and other international powers.\u201d\n\nUnpleasant as it can be, the international powers can live with an Iranian hegemony bullying the Middle East. Certain US and European strategic interests may be negatively affected, human rights and civil order may be endangered, support for terrorism can increase, and oil supplies may be pressured. But the US, the Europeans, and their allies can push back. (For Russia and China, a stronger Iran is probably a net gain.) The US has and will continue to counter all these conventional threats, and deals with a regional despot can always be made. And there is a grand payoff: if this nuclear agreement works, (and the technical experts are saying there is a good chance that it will), the worst-case scenario for the international community\u2014real radioactive fallout\u2014is prevented. If the deal fails, the US and its +5 international partners have unlimited options and improved starting positions in the future. That is Obama\u2019s compelling case. In Israel, many of us are experts at cultivating the feeling that we are alone in the world, that our view is the right one, and everyone who disagrees is wrong. Sometime we put the blame on anti-Semitism and sometimes on a lack of hasbara. It is not easy for us to accept that Israel\u2019s interests may objectively differ from the interests of the United States and other international powers. It\u2019s probably an even more difficult call for the American Jewish community.\n\n* * *", "article_metadata": {"description": "A set of theories for what\u2019s really behind opposition to the Iran deal in Israel and the United States\u2014including that the two nations\u2019 interests may be diverging when it comes to Iran.", "author": "James Fallows", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Competing theories for what\u2019s really behind opposition to the Iran deal in Israel and America", "title": "What If Barack and Bibi Are Both Right on Iran?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/08/CarterToast/facebook.jpg?1439493617", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/08/israel-opposition-iran-deal/401129/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "For Israel, the possibility of a nuclear weapon in Teheran is, of course, a threat of a different magnitude.\nBut this agreement will drastically reduce, and may eliminate, the possibility that this bad actor will hold a nuclear weapon in its pocket.\nA serious problem for the United States, Israel, and others: yes.\nIn order to obtain Iran\u2019s nominal acceptance of the deal, the 5+1 are pledged to dismantle trade sanctions maintained against Iran.\nFor the United States and its international partners (China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Germany) the deal, at best removes, and at worst delays, Iran\u2019s development and acquisition of a nuclear weapon."}
