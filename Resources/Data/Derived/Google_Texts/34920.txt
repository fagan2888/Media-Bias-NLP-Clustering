The conservative group America Rising Squared got their hands on a recent “Fight for 15” email which indicated the group was planning to send a bus of protesters to tonight’s event. They arrived in due time, according to Twitter.

Brian Rogers, executive director of AR2, has a slightly different definition of "Fight for 15" that you won't find on the campaign's website:

“Contrary to what its big labor union funders want to portray, the ‘Fight for $15’ is actually a highly-orchestrated multi-million dollar effort by the SEIU to increase its shrinking membership rolls and gain hundreds of millions in new members’ dues,” he said in a statement Saturday.

The American Action Forum released a study last year that concluded raising the minimum wage would result in the loss of 6.6 million jobs. Does that sound like a worthy goal to “fight” for?

One of the protesters’ reported targets is the media filing center. I’ll let you know if they make their way in.
