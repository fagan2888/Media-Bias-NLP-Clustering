Exemptions include not making enough money to be able to afford insurance, being a victim of domestic violence, the death of a family member and filing for bankruptcy.\n\nThe TurboTax tax filing preparation software unit of Intuit last month reportedly said that about 70 percent of uninsured customers were claiming an exemption.\n\nThe penalty for not having coverage in 2015 is the higher of $325 per adult or 2 percent of taxable household income. That's up from the penalty imposed last tax season on uninsured people, which was the higher of $95 per adult or 1 percent of household income.\n\nThe H&R Block tax preparation company earlier this month said that people who are uninsured so far this tax season are paying more than double that what they did last year to satisfy the Obamacare penalty. The average penalty so far has been $383 for uninsured H&R Block customers this season, compared to the average of $172 in penalties paid last year.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Most people will just need to check a box on their tax forms indicating if they had health coverage, but some may have to repay Obamacare subsidies.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Most people will just need to check a box on their tax forms indicating if they had health coverage.", "title": "Time to get your Obamacare tax situation in order", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/18/time-to-get-your-obamacare-tax-situation-in-order.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/03/18/103481071-GettyImages-495382784.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Most people will just need to check a box on their tax forms indicating if they had health coverage.", "title": "Time to get your Obamacare tax situation in order", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/18/time-to-get-your-obamacare-tax-situation-in-order.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2016/03/18/103481071-GettyImages-495382784.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Health Care, Health Care, Obamacare, Taxes, Health Insurance, Politics, US: News, IRS, Treasury Department, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2016-03-18T15:30:17-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Care", "modified_time": "2016-03-18T15:41:59-0400", "tag": "Treasury Department"}, "pageNodeId": 103481066, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, taxes, income taxes, HealthCare.gov, tax penalty, subsidies"}, "article_summary": "Mazur noted that up to 94 percent of people file their tax returns electronically, which makes dealing with the tax implications of the Affordable Care Act relatively easy for most.\nThe H&R Block tax preparation company earlier this month said that people who are uninsured so far this tax season are paying more than double that what they did last year to satisfy the Obamacare penalty.\nThat's up from the penalty imposed last tax season on uninsured people, which was the higher of $95 per adult or 1 percent of household income.\nThe TurboTax tax filing preparation software unit of Intuit last month reportedly said that about 70 percent of uninsured customers were claiming an exemption.\nMost Americans, an estimated 80 percent, will only be required, as they were last year, to check a box on their tax returns indicating they had health insurance coverage over the course of 2015, meaning they won't have to pay the Obamacare penalty."}
