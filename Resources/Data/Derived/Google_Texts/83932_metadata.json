We\u2019re not what you see in the media. That\u2019s what happens when you don\u2019t get the right mental health,\u201d said behavioral health patient Robert Hedden.\n\n\u201cThey helped me with housing. I\u2019ve been clean for three years now,\u201d said Darrel Brown.\n\nMore recovery success stories can happen if and when and as New Jersey\u2019s Departments of Human Services and Health continue to rid the state of regulations that act as barriers to integrated health. That\u2019s what this study concludes. Seton Hall University Law Professor John Jacobi co-authored it for the Nicholson Foundation.\n\n\u201cThe problem that arises if you provide the services in a separate setting, there are people lost to follow up. It is difficult for people with serious mental illness to maintain complicated schedules of doctors visits. It is much better from a clinical perspective to provide services for someone when they\u2019re in a setting in which they\u2019re comfortable where they\u2019re receiving their mental health care to just take them down the hall so that they can see an advanced practice nurse,\u201d Jacobi said.\n\nFive years ago, Catholic Charities offered integrated care for one day a week, and it says it saw drastic cuts in emergency room visits and hospitalizations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such an impressive outcome and it\u2019s not disruptive,\u201d said Catholic Charities of Trenton Association Executive Director of Operations Harry Postel.\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, it expanded two years ago to five days a week. Psychiatric care right next to the pharmacy.\n\n\u201cSo people don\u2019t have to leave or forget to go get their prescription,\u201d Postel said.\n\nCatholic Charities in Trenton says it knew it had to offer integrated health care services when it looked at the numbers of those who typically benefit from those kind of services have a lifespan that\u2019s 25 years shorter than the rest of the population.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been easier to help people achieve their goals,\u201d said Program Director Cheryl Davis.\n\nThis is one of four behavioral health homes in the state. Today Gov. Chris Christie said the model is so successful he\u2019s expanding it by seven new agencies in New Jersey.\n\n\u201cBecause you just get a much better consistent quality of care if you see the same physician privately all the time than you do if you\u2019re bouncing in and out of emergency rooms despite the best efforts of the doctors and nurses there. If they only see you once, it\u2019s very hard for them to understand exactly how to treat you if they don\u2019t know and understand your history,\u201d he said.\n\nThe governor says the integrated care models are the result of his administration knocking down regulatory barriers, ones the industry says have hindered better health care and lowering costs for far too long.\n\n\u201cThe focus on the state level and the federal level has to be the person. What is it that we need to do in order to help that individual succeed,\u201d said Executive Director Marlene Lao-Collins.\n\nFollow @HillNJTV", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "pubdate": 20160407, "og": {"site_name": "NJTV News", "description": "Catholic Charities of Trenton has a successful integrated health care program with behavioral and physical health care under one roof.
