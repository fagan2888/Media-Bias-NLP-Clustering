On Fox TV, it is assumed that the Nicaraguan meteorologist knows all about tacos.\n\nIt\u2019s fairly obvious by now that Fox News is a place where being offensive and ignorant is not just permitted, but encouraged. For example: How much fun is it to make fun of someone\u2019s ethnic heritage inaccurately? So much fun. In an exchange that is indistinguishable from schoolyard bullying and outright nincompoop-ism, Fox News host Brian Kilmeade on Friday said he assumed that the network\u2019s Latina meteorologist \u201cgrew up on tacos,\u201d because she is from a Spanish-speaking country, and of course, they are all the same.\n\nBeing the multi-ethnic bastion that it is, Fox & Friends featured a segment on making tacos to celebrate National Taco Day. Kilmeade turned to Fox News Weather team member Maria Molina, who was born in Nicaragua and grew up in South Florida and asked, \u201cSo what are the tips we need to know? You grew up on tacos, correct?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I did not grow up on tacos!\u201d Molina snapped. \u201cI\u2019m Nicaraguan. It\u2019s not a native food.\u201d\n\nDoes she really think that these people are educable?\n\n2. Poor Ted Cruz: first a Republican \u201clynch mob\u201d is after him, and then Democrats hurt his feelings.\n\nSome Republicans are very mad at Ted Cruz, whose antics against Obamacare spiraled into the impasse that became the government shutdown, which is beginning to play very badly for the GOP. So on Wednesday, a group of Senate Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, railed against Cruz at a private luncheon, according to theNew York Times. Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin were there as well, and some of these senators became very angry with Cruz\u2019s intransigence, and lit into him. An unnamed senator described the scene thusly to the Times: \u201cIt just started a lynch mob.\u201d\n\nLynch mob is a term that is being tossed around rather cavalierly these days, if you ask us. But then a lot of racially loaded terms are flying during the Obama administration, and anyone who thinks that is an accident is a fool. (See next item.)\n\nPoor Ted Cruz was feeling really picked on all week, and not just by his own party. Democrats, he said at week\u2019s end, are portraying him as the \u201croot of all evil in the world.\u201d How could they, when really everyone knows that Obamacare, or affordable healthcare, is the root of all evil in the world?\n\n3. Rep. William O\u2019Brien, R-N.H.: \u201cObamacare is as bad as Fugitive Slave Act.\u201d\n\nObamacare, in the conservative echo-sphere, is the worst thing ever to befall mankind, and that is why it must at any cost be prevented, no matter how futile, ridiculous or damaging these actions may be. Rep. William O\u2019Brien joined the anti-Obamacare hysteria this week with his racially tinged analogy comparing Obamacare to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which made it against the law not to return runaway slaves to their owners. Hmmm, wonder why something slavery-related popped into his head to describe the signature legislation of the first black president.\n\nHere\u2019s how he justified his offensive comparison to the Manchester Union Leader: \u201cJust as the Fugitive Slave Act was an overreach by the federal government, so too we understand that Obamacare is an assault on the rights of individuals.\u201d\n\nOh, so nothing racial about it at all.\n\n4. Rep. Todd Rokita, R-Ind.: Obamacare is the worst law known to man, pretty lady.\n\nCrazed Republicans are really enjoying the attention they are getting what with the shutdown, and how they are saving the world from the abomination of Obamacare. Rep. Todd Nokita took full advantage of his moments in the sun this week, first when he said: \u201cWe just want to help the American people to get through one of the most insidious laws created by man, that is Obamacare.\u201d\n\nPlease save us, Republican heroes.\n\nStill enjoying the spotlight, Rokita mixed it up with CNN\u2019s Carol Costello later in the week, again defending the shutdown as a small price to pay for saving America from the horror of affordable healthcare. Finally, he gave up on trying to explain this all to Costello, saying, \u201cCarol, you\u2019re beautiful, but you have to be honest as well.\u201d\n\nMmmm, sexism. That\u2019s hot.\n\n5. Not to be outdone: Bill O\u2019Reilly finally weighs in on Obamacare\n\nIt did not seem possible, but Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly took fear-mongering to a new level on Thursday when he told viewers to think of President Obama\u2019s healthcare law as a \u201cvicious motorcycle gang\u201d coming for their daughters.\n\nYeah, that\u2019s right.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like this,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cYour teenager comes to you, saying she wants to attend a dance. You have some misgivings, but you say okay because she\u2019s so passionate about the issue. Then you learn a vicious motorcycle gang may well show up at the dance, so you change your mind based upon best available evidence. And you protect your daughter from possible danger. Obamacare is like that.\u201d\n\nSee?\n\n6. Rafael Cruz (yep, Ted\u2019s Dad): Obama\u2019s on the side of the Muslims.\n\nTed Cruz is not the only member of his family with political aspirations and a talent for crazy talk. Speaking at a GOP rally in Adams County, Colo., Ted\u2019s dad, right-wing pastor Rafael Cruz said: \u201cSo Barack Obama said: \u2018If the winds shift, I will side with the Muslims.\u2019 McCain couldn\u2019t say that, because it\u2019s not politically correct. It is time to stop being politically correct!\u201d\n\nWhat he really meant is it\u2019s time to stop being correct at all, or to have your words reflect any sort of reality. That\u2019s what time it is, America.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Republican congressman actually argued that Obamacare is as bad as the Fugitive Slave Act", "title": "10 most appalling comments from the right \u2014 just this week", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A Republican congressman actually argued that Obamacare is as bad as the Fugitive Slave Act", "title": "10 most appalling comments from the right \u2014 just this week", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/10/09/10_most_appalling_comments_from_the_right_just_this_week_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/09/Bill-Oreily-921-e1415888844596.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Republican congressman actually argued that Obamacare is as bad as the Fugitive Slave Act", "title": "10 most appalling comments from the right \u2014 just this week", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2012/09/Bill-Oreily-921-e1415888844596.jpeg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Janet Allon", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, fox & friends, Fox News, Ted Cruz, William O'Brien", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f87\"", "article_summary": "Topics: AlterNet, fox & friends, Fox News, Ted Cruz, William O'Brien, Politics NewsThis article originally appeared on Alternet1.\nTed Cruz is not the only member of his family with political aspirations and a talent for crazy talk.\nPoor Ted Cruz: first a Republican \u201clynch mob\u201d is after him, and then Democrats hurt his feelings.\nPoor Ted Cruz was feeling really picked on all week, and not just by his own party.\nBeing the multi-ethnic bastion that it is, Fox & Friends featured a segment on making tacos to celebrate National Taco Day."}
