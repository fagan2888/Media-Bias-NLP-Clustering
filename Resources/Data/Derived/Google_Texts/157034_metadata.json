As we continue this series today, we hear from David Wachter, managing director at direct secondary investor W Capital Partners.\n\nWhat surprised you the most about 2015?\n\nThe expectation that high valuation private rounds are a precursor to near-term exits and IPOs. Private market valuations have been bid up to multiples significantly higher than those in the public markets due to the search for growth investment opportunities. This spread has effectively caused a narrowing of the IPO window and M&A market as companies need several years to grow into their private valuations. As a result, investors who signed up for a quick flip will need to settle in for the long haul.\n\nWhat do you think will be the biggest challenge the industry will face in 2016?\n\nManaging expectations among shareholders, management and employees in an environment where capital becomes more costly and exits become more uncertain. Many growth companies have business plans that rely on additional financings or an IPO within one to two years. Companies that need money may have to modify their business plan, raise more expensive capital, or both, and all stakeholders will have to adjust their expectations of the timing and valuation of an exit.\n\nHow do you think secondary deal volume in 2016 will compare to 2015?\n\nSecondary deal volume is highly dependent upon the perception of market conditions and volatility. If rates rise and the overall markets experience significant volatility, co-investors and other recent entrants to the private markets will need to reevaluate their objectives for their private investment portfolios. Investors that are less comfortable with a long-term hold period or supporting their investments with additional capital will drive increased interest in secondary directs.\n\n\u2013Compiled by Laura Kreutzer", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Private Equity Beat reached out to various members of the private equity community to hear their thoughts on the year that passed and the challenges that lie ahead.", "title": "In Their Own Words With W Capital Partners\u2019 David Wachter", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/12/29/in-their-own-words-with-w-capital-partners-david-wachter/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LW686_Wachte_G_20151229090655.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "In Their Own Words With W Capital Partners\u2019 David Wachter", "description": "Private Equity Beat reached out to various members of the private equity community to hear their thoughts on the year that passed and the challenges that lie ahead.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Laura Kreutzer", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Private Equity Beat Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Private Equity Beat", "article.summary": "Private Equity Beat reached out to various members of the private equity community to hear their thoughts on the year that passed and the challenges that lie ahead.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-12-29T19:23:42-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/12/29/in-their-own-words-with-w-capital-partners-david-wachter/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-PEBB-19376", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Private Equity Beat reached out to various members of the private equity community to hear their thoughts on the year that passed and the challenges that lie ahead.", "title": "In Their Own Words With W Capital Partners\u2019 David Wachter", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/12/29/in-their-own-words-with-w-capital-partners-david-wachter/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-LW686_Wachte_G_20151229090655.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Private Equity Beat", "article.id": "BL-PEBB-19376", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-12-29T19:24:25-05:00"}, "article_summary": "As we continue this series today, we hear from David Wachter, managing director at direct secondary investor W Capital Partners.\nPhoto courtesy of W Capital PartnersEach year around this time, Private Equity Beat asks members of the industry to share their reflections on the past year and their predictions for the 12 months ahead.\nPrivate market valuations have been bid up to multiples significantly higher than those in the public markets due to the search for growth investment opportunities.\nThis spread has effectively caused a narrowing of the IPO window and M&A market as companies need several years to grow into their private valuations.\nManaging expectations among shareholders, management and employees in an environment where capital becomes more costly and exits become more uncertain."}
