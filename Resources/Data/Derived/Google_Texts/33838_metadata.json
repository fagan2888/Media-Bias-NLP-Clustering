Shine on Friday profiled the Ukrainian model, who is an educator at the School of Out-of-Body Travel and who describes her work as \u201can international school in which our instructors show students how to leave their physical body and travel in their spiritual body.\u201d\n\nArtist and researcher Nickolay Lamm, who published a piece called What Would Barbie Look Like as an Average Woman, said that Lukyanova is emblematic of what can happen when young girls internalize idealized proportions, like those of Barbie dolls.\n\n\u201cYoung women who are healthy and fit, say \u2018I need to lose some weight,\u2019\u201d Lamm said. \u201cWho are they comparing themselves to? [Lukyanova] is so extreme that people think she's a crazy weirdo and don't look at the bigger, much more silent problem of young girls trying to achieve an impossible ideal.\u201d\n\nLukyanova, who claims she has had no other plastic surgery other than breast implants, was the subject of a 2013 documentary film called Space Barbie, by Vice magazine, which profiled her life. The Human Barbie denies that she removed any ribs to make her waist smaller, and says she subsists on a liquid-only, vegetarian diet.\n\nBut her Barbie archetype body is not the only thing that makes Lukyanova bizarre. In true \u201cSpace Barbie\u201d style, Lukyanova, who says her \u201cspiritual name\u201d is Amatue, told the Daily Beast in August that she started having out-of-body experiences as a child and can now regularly time travel and visit aliens from other civilizations using \"light.\"\n\n(When asked to explain the metaphysics behind using light as a mode of time transport, she was unable.)\n\nMarried for ten years, she refuses to acknowledge that her husband is \u201chuman.\u201d At one time, Lukyanova appeared to have found her soul mate, another plastic-surgery junkie named Justin Jedlica, whom she met on a photo shoot in early 2013, but soured on him when he tattled on her multiple plastic surgeries.\n\nLukyanova\u2019s ultimate goal? She told a reporter for the Independent: \u201cIn recent weeks I have not been hungry at all; I'm hoping it's the final stage before I can subsist on air and light alone.\u201d\n\nGood luck with that.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Valeria Lukyanova, the 28-year-old \u201creal-life Barbie doll,\u201d continues to transform herself into the rail thin, bleached out human replica of the classic Barbie", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Examiner.com", "description": "The man and woman who altered their bodies to become real-life Barbie and Ken did not hit it off.
