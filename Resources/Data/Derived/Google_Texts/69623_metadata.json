Drug manufacturers and some cancer doctors criticized the initiative, saying it placed too much emphasis on saving money and too little on ensuring patients\u2019 access to treatment.\n\n\u201cI deal every day with people fighting for their lives, and I am more sympathetic to them, their desire to live and to get the right treatment,\u201d said Ellen V. Sigal, the founder and chairwoman of Friends of Cancer Research, a public education and advocacy group, even as she noted her concern about rising drug costs.\n\nUnder the proposal, announced Tuesday, Medicare would try a half-dozen new ways of paying for prescription drugs in Part B of Medicare, under which $20 billion was spent last year on medications administered in doctors\u2019 offices and hospital outpatient departments.\n\nThe announcement is only a proposal for a test, but it has huge implications for the pharmaceutical industry, especially for the big, fast-growing category of specialty drugs known as biologics. The proposal could, for the first time, link Medicare payments to the effectiveness of a drug and the cost of comparable medications \u2014 factors not normally considered in the current reimbursement formula, which is based on the average sales price of drugs, with an additional 6 percent allowance for storage and handling costs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor decades, Congress has legislated Medicare payment rates in minute detail. But the Affordable Care Act authorized the secretary of health and human services to test new \u201cpayment and service delivery models\u201d and adopt them nationwide if they save money without harming the quality of care.\n\nSylvia Mathews Burwell, the health secretary, has shown she is willing to make aggressive use of this power, with the blessing of President Obama.\n\nThe Republican chairmen of three powerful congressional committees denounced the administration\u2019s plan on Wednesday, describing it, in a joint statement, as \u201canother troubling example of unelected bureaucrats making decisions behind closed doors.\u201d The proposal could limit access to care for some of the sickest Medicare beneficiaries, said the statement, issued by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Representatives Fred Upton of Michigan, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.\n\nThe Obama administration said its proposal would not interfere in any way with the \u201cmedical judgment\u201d of doctors or their \u201cability to order reasonable and necessary Part B drugs as appropriate.\u201d It did say, \u201cWe intend to achieve savings,\u201d though officials could not say how much. The administration said it expected to change the \u201cprescribing behavior\u201d of doctors by giving them financial incentives to choose less expensive drugs that are at least as effective as more costly medications.\n\nStacy J. Sanders, the federal policy director at the Medicare Rights Center, a consumer advocacy group, welcomed the proposal, saying it would reduce the incentive for doctors to prescribe drugs that are expensive and ultimately unaffordable for low- and middle-income people who have no supplemental insurance.\n\nOther advocates were cautious in their initial reactions.\n\nLeslie B. Fried, a health lawyer at the National Council on Aging, a service and advocacy group, said: \u201cIf this is a way to take account of the value of treatments and control Part B costs, that\u2019s a good thing. But we also have to be concerned about access to care for beneficiaries. It\u2019s a balance.\u201d\n\nIn a notice to be published in the Federal Register on Friday, the administration says it wants to require \u201cmandatory participation\u201d for doctors and hospitals that provide Part B drugs to Medicare beneficiaries in geographic areas selected for the test, a large part of the country. In three-fourths of the nation\u2019s 7,000 \u201cprimary care service areas,\u201d Medicare would pay for Part B drugs using reimbursement formulas different from the ones in the Medicare law.\n\nCongress has provided broad bipartisan support for Mr. Obama\u2019s plan to collect genetic data on one million volunteers so scientists can develop drugs and treatments tailored to the characteristics of individual patients. Some of the most enthusiastic supporters of this \u201cprecision medicine initiative\u201d expressed concern about the new Medicare drug payment model.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWe are moving into an era of personalized medicine,\u201d said Leslie Ritter, a vice president of the Society for Women\u2019s Health Research, a nonprofit advocacy group. \u201cThe primary focus should be on the patient, not on costs. In many cases, we don\u2019t know what works best for patients because women and members of minority groups were not adequately represented in clinical trials.\u201d\n\nTwo influential lobbies, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, strenuously opposed the administration\u2019s plan, saying it could put Medicare patients at risk. Prices for new cancer drugs often exceed $100,000 a year, and it is not unusual to see television commercials and magazine advertisements promoting such treatments.\n\nDr. Allen S. Lichter, the chief executive of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which represents cancer doctors, said the administration had identified a real problem, \u201cthe skyrocketing prices of drugs.\u201d But he added, \u201cDoctors did not create this problem, and it will not be solved by putting pressure on physicians.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160309205314,
