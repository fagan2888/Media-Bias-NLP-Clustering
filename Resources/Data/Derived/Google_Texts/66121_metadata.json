Jay Inslee today signed the 2015 supplemental operating budget to keep Washington\u2019s budget balanced through the remainder of the 2013\u201315 biennium, which ends June 30.\n\n\u201cSupplemental budgets are intended to cover extraordinary expenses or unexpected costs,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cParticularly with last year\u2019s wildfires and needed investments in mental health, these are responsible budget adjustments.\u201d\n\nIt includes $88 million to cover the costs of responding to and recovering from last year\u2019s wildfires, including the Carlton Complex fire, the largest fire in state history.\n\nThe supplemental budget also addresses a number of pressing human service needs. The budget:\n\nBoosts investments in the state\u2019s child welfare system for foster care services, including supervised parental visitations and extended foster care.\n\nReimburses 15 regional support networks for higher costs not covered under Medicaid.\n\nFunds a new 30-bed civil ward and a 15-bed forensic ward at Western State Hospital.\n\nIncreases the number of staff providing competency evaluation services.\n\nSatisfies the home care workers\u2019 judgment in the Rekhter case.\n\nThe supplemental budget increases the total biennial budget by about $218 million.\n\n\u201cI commend the Legislature for getting the supplemental budget to my desk so quickly,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cI look forward to working with lawmakers on our next big challenge \u2014 building a sustainable budget for the next biennium that makes a bold commitment to education, protects vital services and recognizes the sacrifices our teachers and state workers have made during the past six years.\u201d\n\nTo help the Legislature move forward on passing the 2015\u201317 budget, the supplemental budget bill \u2014 which becomes effective immediately \u2014 includes a provision requiring that next quarterly state revenue forecast be moved up a month. Instead of March 20, the next forecast will be unveiled tomorrow.", "article_metadata": {"description": "OLYMPIA \u2013 Gov.
