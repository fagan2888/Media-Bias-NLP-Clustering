Republicans have fought tooth-and-nail against the exchanges and other provisions of the law, describing the reforms as a massive and unnecessary government intrusion into the private sector.\n\nBut the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation said those subsidies now are expected to be lower because insurance premium costs have run below previous estimates.\n\nThey also again lowered their forecast of the number of people who were expected to enroll in the exchanges, which reduces the need for subsidies. That number is expected to fluctuate between 22 and 24 million from 2017 through 2025, compared to between 24 and 25 million in the January forecast.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest called the estimates \u201cthe latest in a long line of data points that indicate the Affordable Care Act is contributing in a very positive way to holding down the growth of healthcare costs in this country.\u201d\n\nThe lower health insurance costs also contributed to a net $431 billion reduction in the CBO\u2019s estimate of cumulative 10-year U.S. budget deficits, now forecast at $7.209 trillion.\n\nAlso contributing to the lower deficits for the fiscal 2016-2025 period were reduced estimates for interest payments on the federal debt, slightly lower costs for the Medicare health program for seniors, and slightly higher anticipated tax revenues.\n\nCBO revised its fiscal 2015 deficit forecast to $486 billion, up $18 billion from the January estimate, due to technical changes to cost estimates for federal benefits including Medicare, the Medicaid health program for the poor, and some student loan programs.\n\nThe change means that this year\u2019s deficit is now expected to be slightly higher than last year\u2019s $483 billion budget gap.\n\n(Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Paul Simao)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "U.S. Congressional forecasters on Monday once again cut their estimate of Affordable Care Act health insurance coverage costs, citing unexpectedly less spe", "application-name": "Insurance Journal", "og": {"site_name": "Insurance Journal", "description": "U.S. Congressional forecasters on Monday once again cut their estimate of Affordable Care Act health insurance coverage costs, citing unexpectedly less spe", "title": "Affordable Care Act Cost Estimate Drops Due to Lower Subsidies, Enrollment", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "url": "http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2015/03/10/359933.htm", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "U.S. Congressional forecasters on Monday once again cut their estimate of Affordable Care Act health insurance coverage costs, citing unexpectedly less spe", "creator": "@ijournal", "image": "https://www.insurancejournal.com/img/insurancejournal-square.png", "title": "Affordable Care Act Cost Estimate Drops Due to Lower Subsidies, Enrollment", "site": "@ijournal", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#B10000", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-128x128.png", "robots": "noodp", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x558.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-558x270.png", "fb": {"page_id": 75524109257, "pages": 75524109257, "app_id": 106194681485}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-144x144.png", "msapplication-starturl": "/?utm_source=windows&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=windows-pinned-sites", "date": "2015-03-10", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/insurancejournal", "section": "National News", "tag": "Research and Trends", "published_time": "2015-03-10T08:37:59-04:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/img/insurance-journal-tile-270x270.png"}, "article_summary": "U.S. Congressional forecasters on Monday once again cut their estimate of Affordable Care Act health insurance coverage costs, citing unexpectedly less spending on premium subsidies and lower enrollment rates through exchanges set up under the 2010 reform.\nAlso contributing to the lower deficits for the fiscal 2016-2025 period were reduced estimates for interest payments on the federal debt, slightly lower costs for the Medicare health program for seniors, and slightly higher anticipated tax revenues.\nBut the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation said those subsidies now are expected to be lower because insurance premium costs have run below previous estimates.\nThe change means that this year\u2019s deficit is now expected to be slightly higher than last year\u2019s $483 billion budget gap.\nThey also again lowered their forecast of the number of people who were expected to enroll in the exchanges, which reduces the need for subsidies."}
