A toddler apparently wandered away from his Surprise home Sunday morning, causing his mom some terrifying moments.

The little boy's mom called 911 at about 8 a.m. when she could not find her 3-year-old son.

Officers responded and immediately started searching the area of 175th Avenue and Waddell Road.

Police found him less than an hour later about four blocks away.

A neighbor saw the toddler and wrapped him in a blanket until police could get there.

The boy, who was not hurt, was reunited with this mother.

Sgt. Norman Owens of the Surprise Police Department said no charges are pending.
