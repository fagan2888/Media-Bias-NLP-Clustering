Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa | MGN

Japan's prime minister says he's "speechless" after an online video purported to show one of two Japanese hostages of the extremist Islamic State group had been killed and is promising to save the other.

Shinzo Abe said on NHK TV early Sunday that the video is likely authentic and offered condolences to the family and friends of Haruna Yukawa, a 42-year-old adventurer taken hostage last year.

Abe declined to comment on the message on the latest video demanding a prisoner exchange for journalist Kenji Goto.

He had said in an earlier statement that Japan will not give in to terrorism.

President Barack Obama has offered condolences to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over the killing of a Japanese national by the Islamic State group.

The White House says Obama telephoned Abe from India. Obama arrived there Sunday morning for a three-day visit.

In an earlier statement, Obama condemned the "brutal murder" of Japanese citizen Haruna Yukawa. Obama's statement didn't say how the U.S. knew Yukawa was dead. The Japanese government is reviewing an online video that purports to show his death.

Obama says in the statement that the United States will stand "shoulder to shoulder" with Japan. The White House says he also conveyed that message to Abe during their conversation.

Obama also called for the immediate release of a second Japanese hostage being held by the militants.
