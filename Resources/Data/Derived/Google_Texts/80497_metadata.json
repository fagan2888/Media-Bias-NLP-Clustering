(\u201cI don\u2019t have any desire,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to keep living in the past about what Ferguson did. It\u2019s out of my control.\u201d) He also doesn\u2019t seem to recognize or value Brown\u2019s personhood. (\u201cDo I think about who he was as a person? Not really, because it doesn\u2019t matter at this point. Do I think he had the best upbringing? No. Not at all.\u201d)\n\nBut to me, the most fascinating part of the interview was the portion where Wilson makes the false claim others often make: that the present is divorced from the past.\n\n\u201cPeople who experienced that, and were mistreated, have a legitimate claim,\u201d he told me. \u201cOther people don\u2019t.\u201d I asked him if he thought that young people in North County and elsewhere used this legacy as an excuse. \u201cI think so,\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cI am really simple in the way that I look at life,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWhat happened to my great-grandfather is not happening to me. I can\u2019t base my actions off what happened to him.\u201d Wilson said that police officers didn\u2019t have the luxury of dwelling on the past. \u201cWe can\u2019t fix in thirty minutes what happened thirty years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to fix what\u2019s happening now. That\u2019s my job as a police officer. I\u2019m not going to delve into people\u2019s life-long history and figure out why they\u2019re feeling a certain way, in a certain moment.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m not a psychologist.\u201d\n\nAh, this is exactly why structural racism is so resilient: detachment. It requires a faith in individualism separate from systems and history, a faith in a lie. Both Wilson and Brown were operating in a cultural context informed by more than their own actions \u2014 it was born long before they were, it is ingrained, it is institutional, it is not only racially aware but racially conceived.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNothing occurring in America can be divorced from America, the whole of America as it now exists and came to exist. Our present culture rests on historical context.\n\nYet this false detachment and distancing is what makes the predation of structural racism so perfect: It is an edifice without a single, maleficent architect or even a council thereof. It grows out of collective desire to perform a collective deed. It isn\u2019t so much conscious brainchild as subliminal mind meld.\n\nIt is like the hive. No single bee need be aware of the hive\u2019s entirety or its enormity. Just doing one seemingly innocuous task contributes to the whole. In fact, you needn\u2019t participate at all to reap the benefits of the system.\n\nIt is as exquisite as it is insidious. It can also be deadly.\n\nAt another point, Wilson talks about the disproportionately black towns in what is called \u201cNorth County\u201d \u2014 where he chose to work, by the way, for career advancement reasons \u2014 as a kind of culturally degenerate morass. He is quoted as saying in the article of the citizens there: \u201cThey\u2019re so wrapped up in a different culture than \u2014 what I\u2019m trying to say is, the right culture, the better one to pick from.\u201d\n\nHere is the exchange with the author that follows:\n\nThis sounded like racial code language. I pressed him: what did he mean by \u201ca different culture\u201d? Wilson struggled to respond. He said that he meant \u201cpre-gang culture, where you are just running in the streets\u2014not worried about working in the morning, just worried about your immediate gratification.\u201d He added, \u201cIt is the same younger culture that is everywhere in the inner cities.\u201d\n\nWilson speaks of these communities as riddled with pathology rather than ravaged by poverty and, again, as if history, design and systemic racial oppressions like the ones described in the second Justice Department report play no role.\n\nThe station from which we start in the world is not arbitrarily assigned by birth lottery but preordained by legacy. Our lives are built upon past lives, those of parents and ancestors. Our access and mobility are enabled or restricted by structures, both young and ancient. I maintain that there is valor in effort, that trying to overcome is indeed a form of overcoming, that holding fast to hope in a world that would strip one naked of it is itself a herculean effort and a moral victory.\n\nYet I refuse to allow my abiding self-determinism to blind me to systems designed and built on devaluation and destruction. I know as others do the frustration and fatigue of swimming against a current rather than being carried by it. There are realities that must not be ignored or minimized.\n\nWilson\u2019s interview doesn\u2019t make him appear more human. It reaffirms the degree to which the American mind can seek to divest others of humanity, and it lays bare how historical illiteracy and incuriousness creates the comfortable distance on which pernicious structural racism relies.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150806032104, "twitter": {"description": "Wilson must have made the calculation that a magazine profile would humanize and rehabilitate him in some way.
