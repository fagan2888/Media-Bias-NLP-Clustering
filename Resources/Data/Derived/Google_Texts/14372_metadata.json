But recent reviews by a federal watchdog question whether that money is actually helping the war torn region at all.\n\nThe Taskforce for Business and Stability Operations, formed in 2010, was supposed to reduce unemployment and fostering economic growth in Afghanistan. But management issues and lax oversight are hampering its effectiveness--leaving millions of tax dollars vulnerable to waste.\n\nIn a letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, John Sopko, warned the secretary that his team is reviewing \u201ctroubling allegations\u201d about \u201cimprudent spending, profligate travel by employees and contractors and possible mismanagement\u201d at the taskforce.\n\nRelated: U.S. Military Scrapping Billions Worth of Gear in Afghanistan\n\nThe auditors\u2019 letter lists several examples, including a program meant to bolster Afghanistan\u2019s gem industry. The IG found that the U.S. government is paying for Afghan jewelers to travel to Paris, Milan and India for three-month training sessions to help develop the country\u2019s gem industry. The IG, for its part, questions whether spending on those trips was justified.\n\n\u201cDespite these expenditures, it is not clear to me that the gem industry program produced any positive and lasting economic development or increased employment in Afghanistan,\u201d the auditors said in the report.\n\nThe taskforce has previously been under scrutiny by SIGAR and other auditors for management and oversight issues. Sopko has even questioned the agency\u2019s purpose in the first place.\n\n\u201cWe have gotten serious allegations about the management and mismanagement of that agency, as well as a policy question about what they were doing and whether they should have existed,\u201d the auditor told reporters earlier this month.\n\nIn the letter, SIGAR requests a number of documents needed in order to calculate exactly how much money may have been wasted on the program--including travel expense accounts, names of DoD officials that approved spending for the program, evaluations of the gem program and copies of all of the contracts awarded under the program.\n\nRelated: $100 Billion in Aid Squandered in Afghanistan\n\nWhy it Matters:\n\n\n\nThe U.S. is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a program doesn\u2019t seem to be working. What\u2019s worse, the program has existed for four years and, like other DoD programs, has no way of being measured effectively. All this at a time when the U.S. is fighting the war against ISIS and resources for domestic programs are being cut.\n\nThe results of the investigation will be included in an upcoming audit, but if it\u2019s like most other SIGAR reports, you can expect it to be as scathing.\n\nSopko and his team are known for being critical of the U.S. government\u2019s reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. Last month, the auditor called the government\u2019s economic development efforts an \u201cabysmal failure.\u201d He\u2019s also warned that the U.S. is failing to address at least seven major threats that could potentially undermine the entire $104 billion (and counting) reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan.
