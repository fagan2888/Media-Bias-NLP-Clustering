Admitting there were \u2018differences of opinion\u2019, he added: \u2018Some colleagues have said they would not be very keen on working with me, but I am sure these things were said in the heat of the moment.\u2019\n\nFormer MP Dave Nellist, who was expelled from Labour by Mr Kinnock in 1991 over his links to Militant Tendency and is now chairman of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition, said Mr Corbyn would need \u2018a new party\u2019 if he is elected.\n\nHe told the Independent on Sunday: \u2018Jeremy will be a prisoner inside the parliamentary party. More than 90 per cent of them won\u2019t be on his side.\u2019\n\nMiss Kendall insisted that \u2018things will change\u2019 before the new leader is announced on September 12. Mr Burnham questioned whether Mr Corbyn\u2019s anti-austerity agenda was \u2018affordable, deliverable, credible\u2019.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Former,Labour,leader,Neil,Kinnock,warns,malign,Trotskyites,backing,Jeremy,Corbyn,leadership,election", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3183344/Former-Labour-leader-Neil-Kinnock-warns-malign-Trotskyites-backing-Jeremy-Corbyn-leadership-election.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Lord Kinnock warned of 'entryism' - the dangers posed by some of those paying a \u00a33 registration fee to vote, while endorsing Andy Burnham for his ability to appeal to 'the breadth of the British people.'", "title": "Kinnock warns of 'malign Trotskyites' backing Jeremy Corbyn", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3183344/Former-Labour-leader-Neil-Kinnock-warns-malign-Trotskyites-backing-Jeremy-Corbyn-leadership-election.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/08/03/00/285A166F00000578-0-image-a-44_1438557877833.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3183344/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/3183344/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 3183344, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Former,Labour,leader,Neil,Kinnock,warns,malign,Trotskyites,backing,Jeremy,Corbyn,leadership,election", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2015-08-02T23:29:16.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Daniel+Martin,+Chief+Political+Correspondent+For+The+Daily+Mail", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2015-08-03T07:37:04.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock warns malign Trotskyites backing Jeremy Corbyn leadership election"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Lord Kinnock warned of 'entryism' - the dangers posed by some of those paying a \u00a33 registration fee to vote, while endorsing Andy Burnham for his ability to appeal to 'the breadth of the British people.'", "title": "Kinnock warns of 'malign Trotskyites' backing Jeremy Corbyn", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3183344/Former-Labour-leader-Neil-Kinnock-warns-malign-Trotskyites-backing-Jeremy-Corbyn-leadership-election.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/08/03/00/285A166F00000578-0-image-a-44_1438557877833.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/bc/rtmp_uds/1418450360/2015/05/29/1418450360_4264717591001_4264598567001.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Lord Kinnock warned of 'entryism' - the dangers posed by some of those paying a \u00a33 registration fee to vote, while endorsing Andy Burnham for his ability to appeal to 'the breadth of the British people.'"}, "article_summary": "Neil Kinnock yesterday warned that \u2018malign\u2019 Trotskyites are helping Jeremy Corbyn to victory in the Labour leadership contest.\nMr Burnham questioned whether Mr Corbyn\u2019s anti-austerity agenda was \u2018affordable, deliverable, credible\u2019.\nOne senior party figure said Mr Corbyn would struggle to field a complete team of shadow ministers if elected.\nThe former party leader \u2013 who fought to expel hard-Left factions in the 1980s \u2013 urged members to back Andy Burnham instead.\nLabour leadership frontrunner Jeremy Corbyn has dismissed talk of 'entryism' as 'absolute nonsense'Lord Kinnock, leader from 1983 to 1992, warned Mr Corbyn\u2019s backers that \u2018it won\u2019t be enough\u2019 for Labour to become a party of protest."}
