Pataki\u2019s campaign has called the stroke \u201clife-threatening.\u201d\n\nA representative from Pataki\u2019s campaign said in a statement, \u201cThis episode is a shock to us all, as David, only 30 years of age, is a strong young man who enjoyed excellent health. We are praying for his recovery and welcome everyone\u2019s prayers and good wishes.\u201d\n\nAccording to Capital New York, Pataki will not be officially suspending his campaign and still plans to pursue the Republican nomination for the 2016 presidential race.\n\nIn a statement, @GovernorPataki explains he suspended campaign because his son-in-law had a stroke. He\u2019s at ICU in Chicago hospital. \u2014 Jimmy Vielkind (@JimmyVielkind) June 11, 2015\n\nRepeat: @GovernorPataki has not formally suspended his campaign. He\u2019s just canceled events in New Hampshire bc his son-in-law had a stroke. \u2014 Jimmy Vielkind (@JimmyVielkind) June 11, 2015\n\nPataki\u2019s son-in-law apparently suffered the stroke while traveling on an airplane on Tuesday, aides for Pataki\u2019s campaign told Capital New York. Levy and George Pataki\u2019s daughter, Allison, live in Chicago and had been away on vacation. Allison Pataki is pregnant with her first child and is expected to give birth later this year.\n\nAs a result of Levy\u2019s stroke, the flight he was on made an emergency landing in Fargo, North Dakota, where he was treated at Sanford Medical Center, Capital New York reports. George Pataki\u2019s son-in-law was supposed to be moved to Rush University Medical Center in Chicago today. He\u2019s expected to stay in the intensive care unit in Chicago.\n\nSending good thoughts to family of @governorpataki who announced his 30 year old son-in-law suffered serious stroke. \u2014 Kelly O\u2019Donnell (@KellyO) June 11, 2015\n\nIn a statement, George Pataki\u2019s campaign made special mention of the medical personnel who assisted Levy.\n\n\u201cThe Patakis and the Levys want to thank the doctors, nurses and all the staff at the Sanford Medical Center which has been world class and the people of Fargo who have opened their hearts during this difficult time.\u201d\n\nPataki jumped into the crowded race for the GOP bid on May 28 and has since repeatedly been called a long shot for the candidacy. George Pataki is the former three-time Republican governor of New York, which has traditionally been a Democratic state. In fact, the 69-year-old Pataki was only the third Republican politician to be elected to three gubernatorial terms since 1943.\n\nIf elected, George Pataki has said he would repeal the Affordable Care Act and abolish Common Core standards in the educational system.\n\n[Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images]", "article_metadata": {"description": "George Pataki was originally expected to appear on campaign stops in New Hampshire, but he has canceled events after Pataki's son-in-law suffered a stroke", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "George Pataki was originally expected to appear on campaign stops in New Hampshire, but he has canceled events after Pataki\u2019s son-in-law suffered a stroke", "title": "George Pataki Cancels Campaign Dates: 30-Year-Old Son-In-Law In Intensive Care", "url": "http://www.inquisitr.com/2164687/george-pataki-cancels-campaign-dates-30-year-old-son-in-law-in-intensive-care/", "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/George-Pataki1.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-11T21:19:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-11T21:40:11+00:00"}, "type": "article"}, "image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/George-Pataki1.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ed1c24", "datePublished": "2015-06-11T21:19:05+00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 164157850314499, "pages": 71179904752}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/assets/0cec37/dist/images/logos/inq-win.png", "keywords": "george pataki,president 2016,presidential primary,presidential race,republican,republican candidates,republican nomination,stroke,politics", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "y_key": "f282393706a5fd85", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/George-Pataki1.jpg", "height": 409, "width": 670}, "site": "@theinquisitr", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "George Pataki was originally expected to appear on campaign stops in New Hampshire, but he has canceled events after Pataki\u2019s son-in-law suffered a stroke"}, "viewport": "width=980"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2030\"", "article_summary": "If elected, George Pataki has said he would repeal the Affordable Care Act and abolish Common Core standards in the educational system.\n\u2014 Kelly O\u2019Donnell (@KellyO) June 11, 2015In a statement, George Pataki\u2019s campaign made special mention of the medical personnel who assisted Levy.\nGeorge Pataki was originally expected to appear on campaign stops in New Hampshire, but he has canceled events after Pataki\u2019s son-in-law suffered a stroke earlier this week.\nGeorge Pataki\u2019s son-in-law was supposed to be moved to Rush University Medical Center in Chicago today.\nLevy and George Pataki\u2019s daughter, Allison, live in Chicago and had been away on vacation."}
