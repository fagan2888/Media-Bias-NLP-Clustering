California, Judge Rolf Treu said that three state laws making it difficult to fire incompetent teachers violate the state\u2019s equal protection clause, given evidence showing that most \u201cgrossly ineffective\u201d teachers are in high-poverty, low-performing schools.\n\n\u201cEvidence has been elicited in this trial of the specific effect of grossly ineffective teachers on students,\u201d Judge Treu said in his tentative ruling. \u201cThe evidence is compelling. Indeed, it shocks the conscience.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit was brought by nine California public school students and backed by wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneur David Welch, who hired top attorneys from the Los Angeles law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic day. This is a huge, huge win for the children of the state of California, educators and the educational system,\u201d attorney Marcellus McRae said at a Los Angeles news conference after the decision was announced.\n\nEducation Secretary Arne Duncan delivered another blow to teachers unions, a core Democratic Party constituency, by calling the decision \u201ca mandate to fix these problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe students who brought this lawsuit are, unfortunately, just nine out of millions of young people in America who are disadvantaged by laws, practices and systems that fail to identify and support our best teachers and match them with our neediest students,\u201d Mr. Duncan said.\n\nThe legal team for Students Matter, the group defending the nine students, was led by blue-chip lawyers Theodore Boutrous Jr. and former U.S. Solicitor General Ted Olson, who also were involved the lawsuit invalidating California\u2019s Proposition 8 and paving the way for same-sex marriage.\n\nThe California Teachers Association, along with its national affiliate, the National Education Association, criticized the decision as a product of the \u201cbillionaire boys\u2019 club.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit has nothing to do with what\u2019s best for kids, but was manufactured by a Silicon Valley millionaire and a corporate PR firm to undermine the teaching profession and push their agenda on our schools,\u201d California Teachers Association President Dean E. Vogel said in a statement.\n\nThe National Education Association Union argued that without tenure, teachers would be denied due process and school systems would have difficulty attracting \u201cthe best and brightest to the teaching profession \u2014 which already loses up to 50 percent of new teachers within the first five years.\u201d\n\nEven so, public sentiment against the tenure laws has been building.\n\nReports have proliferated in recent years about the Los Angeles Unified School District\u2019s \u201crubber rooms,\u201d where hundreds of teachers accused of wrongdoing are assigned while their cases are resolved. The process can take years.\n\n\u201cThe evidence this court heard was that it could take anywhere from two to almost ten years and cost $50,000 to $450,000 or more to bring these cases to conclusion under the Dismissal Statutes, and that given these facts, grossly ineffective teachers are being left in the classroom because school officials do not wish to go through the time and expense to investigate and prosecute these cases,\u201d said Judge Treu\u2019s ruling.\n\nCalifornia teachers typically must work for 18 months before they are considered eligible for tenure. The Los Angeles school district alone wanted to dismiss 350 grossly ineffective teachers at the time of the trial but had not begun proceedings on any of them, according to the decision.\n\nJudge Treu said \u201csubstantial evidence presented makes it clear to this court that the Challenged Statutes disproportionately affect poor and/or minority students.\u201d\n\nCalifornia has more than 6 million K-12 students and more than 300,000 teachers in public schools, according to the state Department of Education.\n\nJohn Deasy, the superintendent of the state\u2019s largest district, Los Angeles Unified, cheered the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cEvery day these laws remain in place represents another opportunity denied,\u201d said a statement by Mr. Deasy. \u201cI look forward to engaging with our elected leaders here in Los Angeles and in Sacramento about the future of education in California.\u201d\n\nThe decision also was applauded by free-market advocates and others who said that eliminating barriers to firing ineffective teachers would benefit students.\n\n\u201cThanks to a brave group of California students, the unions\u2019 choking grip on our children\u2019s future loosened today,\u201d Terry Pell, president of the Center for Individual Rights, said in a statement. \u201cFor years, teachers unions have been waging war against the very people they are supposed to represent \u2014 students and educators who do not always believe in the unions\u2019 misplaced priorities, including tenure for those who don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d\n\nMr. Pell noted that California teachers unions are fighting another lawsuit, Friedrichs v. California, filed by teachers challenging the payment of compulsory union dues.\n\nOne of the nine students, Julia Macias, also issued a statement on the ruling.\n\n\u201cBeing a kid, sometimes it\u2019s easy to feel as though your voices aren\u2019t heard,\u201d Julia said. \u201cToday I\u2019m glad I did not stay quiet; with the support of my parents I was given the ability to fight for my right for an equal education.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a stunning defeat for teachers' unions, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge found Tuesday that job-security policies such as teacher tenure are unconstitutional because they cause disproportionate harm to poor and minority students.", "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "In a stunning defeat for teachers\u2019 unions, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge found Tuesday that job-security policies such as teacher tenure are unconstitutional because they cause disproportionate harm to poor and minority students.", "title": "Calif. judge rules teacher tenure policies unconstitutional", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/10/calif-judge-teacher-tenure-policies-violation/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/10/ap651853124707.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/10/ap651853124707.jpg", "title": "Calif. judge rules teacher tenure policies unconstitutional", "description": "In a stunning defeat for teachers' unions, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge found Tuesday that job-security policies such as teacher tenure are unconstitutional because they cause disproportionate h", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Education, Labor, Rolf Treu, Los Angeles"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc3de\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEvidence has been elicited in this trial of the specific effect of grossly ineffective teachers on students,\u201d Judge Treu said in his tentative ruling.\nJohn Deasy, the superintendent of the state\u2019s largest district, Los Angeles Unified, cheered the judge\u2019s ruling.\nIn a stunning defeat for California\u2019s powerful teachers unions, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge found Tuesday that job security policies such as tenure are unconstitutional because they cause disproportionate harm to poor and minority students.\nCalifornia teachers typically must work for 18 months before they are considered eligible for tenure.\nThe Los Angeles school district alone wanted to dismiss 350 grossly ineffective teachers at the time of the trial but had not begun proceedings on any of them, according to the decision."}
