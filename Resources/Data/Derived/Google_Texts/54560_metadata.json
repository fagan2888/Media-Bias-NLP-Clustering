The candidate of the Rent Is Too Damn High Party may have lost the New York mayoral election to Bill DeBlasio. But it\u2019s true \u2014 in New York and much of the United States, the rent really is too damn high.\n\nThis graph, based on 2012 data by the consumer expenditure survey of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, breaks down consumer expenditures by pre-tax income:\n\nAs a percentage of income, many expenditures are the same across income groups \u2014 in part because social programs for the poor like Medicaid and food stamps limit out-of-pocket costs on food and health care for low-income Americans. But spending on housing as a share of income increases as income declines \u2014 only 29.9 percent for the highest 20 percent, housing costs are 37.6 percent for the second 20 percent and 39.9 percent for the lowest 20 percent.\n\nThe classic rule is that you should not spend more than 30 percent of your income on housing, whether in the form of rent or a mortgage on a house or condo. But the polarization of income in the U.S., accompanied by the creation of mostly low-paying jobs, has made that prudent standard impossible for a growing number of Americans to meet.\n\nThe problem was worsened, but not caused, by the Great Recession. Even before the economic downturn, according to Harvard\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies, the share of \u201ccost-burdened\u201d renters shelling out more than 30 percent of their pre-tax income to landlords was rising until nearly half of all renters were cost-burdened. The ratio of renters who pay more than 30 percent of their incomes in housing costs has risen from 1 in 4 in 1960 to 1 in 3 in 1980 to 1 in 2 today.\n\nNeither private supply nor public subsidies have compensated for rising renter stress. Let\u2019s start with the supply side. To spend 30 percent or less of a $15,000 income, a renter would have to spend no more than $375 a month on shelter. But in 2011, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies, the median monthly rent was more than $1,000. Fewer than 5 percent of rental units rented for less than $400 and fewer than 34 percent for less than $800.\n\nNor has social policy kept up. Low-income renters in the U.S. are helped by a patchwork of programs. These include the oldest program, public housing, and the more recent fashion of housing-choice vouchers. There are even USDA subsidies for some renters. Meanwhile, the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) subsidizes landlords to maintain and develop low-income housing.\n\nBut it is clear from the statistics that these programs are falling far short of ensuring affordable housing for Americans in the proliferating low-wage economy. In 2011, only 4.6 million renters benefited from rental assistance, while 19.3 million households were eligible.\n\nAnd then there was the bipartisan policy in the 1990s and 2000s of encouraging home ownership rather than renting \u2014 including efforts to peddle mortgages to those known as NINJAs \u2014 no incomes, no jobs and no assets. While that wasn\u2019t the sole cause of the financial crisis, its contributing role should force us to reconsider the American conviction that homeowners are more virtuous and make better citizens than renters. Other countries, including Germany, prosper with far more renters rather than homeowners \u2014 or rather \u201chomedebtors.\u201d\n\nIf housing expenditures for the bottom three quintiles were reduced to the classic standard of 30 percent \u2014 roughly what the richest two quintiles spend \u2014 then the discretionary incomes of low-income renters that could be spent on other things like food, transportation, health care and recreation could be increased \u2014 by nearly 10 percent of their incomes, in the case of the poorest Americans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The old rule was don't spend more than 30 percent of your income on housing.
