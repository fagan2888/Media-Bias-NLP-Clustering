Cause- we all know it is caused by smoking. We all think the number of smokers is way down. Would you believe the estimates are that there are close to 100 million current or former smokers in the US. We measure smoking by pack years. 1 pack of cigarettes a day for 1 year is 1 pack year, 2 packs a day fro 10 years is 20 pack years. Anyone with over 30 pack years is consider at much higher risk of developing Lung Cancer.

Symptoms- Persistent cough, fatigue, unintentional weight loss, breathing problems, hoarse voice.

The prognosis for Lung Cancer is poor because it is often not detected until it is in an advanced stage where surgery and chemotherapy do little to extend life.

The Five year survival rate has not improved much over the years. If the Lung Cancer is found in an advance stage the five year survival rate is very low between 1-5%. However if identified early and found in an early stage the five year survival jumps to 50%.

Sounds easy, just identify the lung cancer early and our survival rate is 10 times higher. Unfortunately it is not that easy, screening for lung cancer is expensive, often not covered by insurance and we have differing opinions on when to do it at all. Many Lung cancers are found incidentally when looking for some other health issue.

Screening is done with a low dose CT scan of the chest. This has the ability to identify cancers in the early stages before symptoms and before advanced spread. Annual Chest X Rays did not reduce the death rate from lung cancer. Low dose CT did by 20%. Cost for the scan- $300-500
