Gallup: Good reviews for Obamacare coverage

A majority of Americans give good reviews for insurance they recently acquired through government exchanges within the past year, a new poll shows.

With the second round of Obamacare enrollment set to begin on Saturday, 71 percent said their coverage through the exchanges was good or excellent, according to a Gallup poll released Friday. Another 19 percent said the coverage was fair, while 9 percent rated it poorly.

The pollster notes that these marks are comparable to all who have health insurance. However, those newly insured through the exchanges are more satisfied with the cost of health care — with 75 percent saying so — versus 61 percent of all insured respondents who said they were satisfied with the cost of health care.

A majority — 68 percent — who received insurance through the exchanges said they plan to renew their policy, while an additional 7 percent said they will look for a new policy, but through the exchanges.

The Gallup poll was conducted Oct. 22-Nov. 12 and surveyed 407 adults who were newly insured through a government health care exchange in 2014. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points.
