Sanders is beating Obama\u2019s Iowa benchmarks. Bernie is now doing better in Iowa against Clinton than Obama was doing in 2007, according to recent polls. Obama trailed Clinton in Iowa by nearly 30 percentage for most of 2007 and in polls that December. In contrast, the latest CBS poll puts Sanders 5 points behind Clinton in Iowa, according to Real Clear Politics tally. For December, her lead has averaged 14.9 percent.\n\nObama won Iowa because of exceptional grassroots organizing, especially among young people. Sanders has said that he hopes to repeat that pattern. In 2008, 240,000 Democrats attended the Iowa caucuses, compared to 125,000 in 2004. Obama was the choice of 57 percent of caucus goers under 29 years old and of more than one-fourth of the first-time caucus attendees that year. An early December Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll that found Sanders was 9 points behind Clinton also said he was leading among participants under 45, independents and first time caucus goers.\n\n2. Sanders is holding his New Hampshire lead. In New Hampshire, which is next to Sanders\u2019 home state of Vermont, he is leading but that contest is also tightening, according to Real Clear Politics. Sanders averaged an 8.6 percent lead in December, but this is where a different ghost of 2008 looms. That year, the Obama campaign was out-hustled on street corners by sign-carrying Clinton supporters, many bused in from New York, giving her a surprise victory.\n\nTop Sanders aides have called both New Hampshire and Iowa must-win states, because the states that follow, Nevada and South Carolina, are seen as Clinton strongholds. Both Bill and Hillary Clinton have spent enormous energy in recent years to build bridges with leaders in Latino and African-American communities. That creates a big hurdle for Sanders, whose response has been to reach out to younger activists like his recent sit-down with Atlanta-based artist and actor Killer Mike.\n\nIf Sanders wins Iowa and New Hampshire, and Clinton wins Nevada and South Carolina, the next contests are in Colorado, Minnesota, Massachusetts and Vermont, all of which occur March 1 and are seen as strong states for Sanders.\n\n3. Sanders is breaking campaign donation records. Sanders is showing that it is more than possible to run for president with the support of millions of people contributing $25 or less, in contrast to almost all other 2016 contenders in both parties who have wealthy benefactors. On Monday, his campaign spokeswoman told Democracy Now that he has 2.3 million contributions, which broke Obama\u2019s record of 2.2 million donations.\n\nSanders breached Obama\u2019s benchmark during Saturday night\u2019s debate, which was seen by an estimated 8 million people nationally. \u201cThe average donation during that period was $25 or less,\u201d the campaign told the New York Times, which speculated that he \u201ccould beat Hillary Clinton for contributions in the final fundraising quarter of the year.\u201d One other underappreciated facet of Sanders\u2019 supporters is he is raising more money than almost all of the Republicans, even some backed by billionaire-fed super PACs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bernie has bested Obama's Iowa benchmarks, and Hillary is beginning to realize she could well lose the nomination", "title": "5 ways Bernie Sanders is gaining ground as the primaries begin", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Bernie has bested Obama's Iowa benchmarks, and Hillary is beginning to realize she could well lose the nomination", "title": "5 ways Bernie Sanders is gaining ground as the primaries begin", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/26/5_ways_bernie_sanders_is_gaining_ground_as_the_primaries_begin_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/bernie-sanders-screen-shot-2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bernie has bested Obama's Iowa benchmarks, and Hillary is beginning to realize she could well lose the nomination", "title": "5 ways Bernie Sanders is gaining ground as the primaries begin", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/bernie-sanders-screen-shot-2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Steven Rosenfeld", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Iowa, New Hampshire", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf06f\"", "article_summary": "Both Bill and Hillary Clinton have spent enormous energy in recent years to build bridges with leaders in Latino and African-American communities.\nSanders is beating Obama\u2019s Iowa benchmarks.\nBernie is now doing better in Iowa against Clinton than Obama was doing in 2007, according to recent polls.\nIn contrast, the latest CBS poll puts Sanders 5 points behind Clinton in Iowa, according to Real Clear Politics tally.\nThat year, the Obama campaign was out-hustled on street corners by sign-carrying Clinton supporters, many bused in from New York, giving her a surprise victory."}
