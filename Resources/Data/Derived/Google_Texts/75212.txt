The Housing and Human Services Department’s Longmont offices, including programs related to public assistance, family and children’s services and child support services, are being moved to 1921 Corporate Center Circle, Suite 3F, in southside Longmont.

County staffers will begin seeing clients at that new location beginning next Monday, Sept. 9. This week, clients who usually visit the Housing and Human Services Department’s 529 Coffman St. location should call the department at 303-441-1000 for assistance.

The Department of Housing and Human Services’ website, www.BoulderCountyHHS.org., has links giving directions and a map to the new Longmont location, as well as information about bus service to the new Corporate Center Circle offices.

The department plans to move its offices back to larger space at the Coffman Street location in the fall of 2015, county officials said.
