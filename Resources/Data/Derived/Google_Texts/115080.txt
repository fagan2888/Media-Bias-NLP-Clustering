Four years of excavation and research in a Colorado reservoir have led to the publication of the Snowmastodon Project Science Volume in an international science journal this month.

After a bulldozer operator uncovered bones during construction at Ziegler Reservoir near Snowmass Village in 2010, scientists from the Denver Museum of Nature & Science — joined by others around the globe — examined the location, according to a news release from the museum.

Fourteen papers by 47 authors from around the world make up the Snowmastodon Project, described as “a new benchmark for understanding climate change in the American West,” said paleontologist Dr. Ian Miller, Snowmastodon Project co-leader and chairman of the museum’s Earth Sciences department.

According to the release, the Snowmastodon site was an ancient lake that filled with sediment between 140,000 and 55,000 years ago, preserving Ice Age fossil ecosystems.

During 69 days in 2010 and 2011, scientists found more than 5,000 large bones and 22,000 small bones, spanning about 50 species, including 35 American mastodons.

The papers, featured in the bimonthly Quaternary Research journal, focus on impacts of climate change, then and now, according to the release.

“The site’s ecosystems — plants, insects and animals combined — varied dramatically in response to climate change,” the release said.
