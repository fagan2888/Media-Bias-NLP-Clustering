Ted Cruz, News, Politics News\n\nTed Cruz didn\u2019t just lament \u201csome of the darkest 24 hours in our nation\u2019s history\u201d after the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings on Obamacare and marriage equality late last week \u2014 he somehow also mustered up the energy to engage in a war of words with political strategist and Fox News contributor Karl Rove.\n\nThe Tea Party Senator and Republican presidential candidate is out with a new book, titled \u201cA Time for Truth,\u201d in which he reveals a whole host of autobiographical tidbits including claims that his Cuban-born father once tried to join Fidel Castro\u2019s army, that he had a porn-watching session with Supreme Court justices and that Karl Rove once threatened and bullied him, a claim that Rove has already called a lie.\n\nThe all but obligatory political memoir by presidential aspirants (or sometimes not) tends to be a bore, full of forced humility and devoid of introspective honesty but conservative firebrand Sen. Cruz\u2019s forthcoming book promises to at least be entertaining.\n\nCruz describes a time when as a law clerk to then Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, he had the opportunity to watch porn with Rehnquist and Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor as research for a case about online porn regulation.\n\n\u201cWe were in front of a large computer screen gazing at explicit, hard-core pornography,\u201d Cruz explains. \u201cA slew of hard-core, explicit images showed up onscreen \u2026 as we watched these graphic pictures fill our screens, wide-eyed, no one said a word. Except for Justice O\u2019Connor, who lowered her head, squinted slightly, and muttered, \u2018Oh, my.'\u201d\n\nCruz also discusses his father\u2019s failed attempt to join Fidal Castro\u2019s army and tells of the time he showed up to an Ivy League admissions interview hungover, but it is his account of political strong-arming by Texas political operative Karl Rove that is most juicy.\n\nThe conservative blog Brietbart.com, published an excerpt of Cruz\u2019s book, highlighting the tale of intimidation by Rove after Cruz sought George H.W. Bush\u2019s endorsement for Texas Attorney General back in 2009:\n\n\u201cKarl had found out about my meeting with George H.W. Bush and called me on the phone. He was irate, demanding, \u2018What in the hell do you think you are doing?!\u201d [\u2026] Rove was \u201cin the process of helping raise money for the George W. Bush presidential library in Dallas,\u201d and that \u201cTexas donors were giving the Bushes tens of millions, including major donors who were supporting the Dallas state rep who wanted to run for attorney general,\u201d so those donors \u201cwere now berating Karl.\u201d [\u2026] \u201cYeah, well I didn\u2019t think you were going to get support from 41.\u201d [\u2026] \u201cHe suggested that the elder Bush was too old to have good judgment anymore.\u201d [\u2026] \u201cReturn the check,\u201d Rove replied. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t do that,\u201d Cruz responded. \u201cWe already deposited it.\u201d \u201cI pointed out that under Texas\u2019s election law, we had to list the contribution on our ethics disclosure report,\u201d Cruz wrote, noting that Rove \u201cpaused for a few seconds.\u201d \u201cAll right, fine,\u201d Rove told him. \u201cThen I want you to do nothing whatsoever to draw attention to it.\u201d And then he pulled out the hammer. He implied that if I made any news about Bush 41\u2019s support, then Bush 43 would endorse my opponent and come out publicly for him\u2014a threat that was fairly striking given that I had devoted four years of my life to working as hard as I could helping to elect Bush and serving in his administration. I always wondered whether Karl had the authority to make these threats on behalf of the former president\u2014he certainly acted like he did.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ted Cruz slams Karl Rove in his new memoir -- and the political strategist is firing back", "title": "Don\u2019t make us pick a side: Ted Cruz and Karl Rove engage in heated war of words", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ted Cruz slams Karl Rove in his new memoir -- and the political strategist is firing back", "title": "Don\u2019t make us pick a side: Ted Cruz and Karl Rove engage in heated war of words", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/29/dont_make_us_pick_a_side_ted_cruz_and_karl_rove_engage_in_heated_war_of_words/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/karl_rove3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ted Cruz slams Karl Rove in his new memoir -- and the political strategist is firing back", "title": "Don\u2019t make us pick a side: Ted Cruz and Karl Rove engage in heated war of words", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/05/karl_rove3.jpg", "creator": "@@SophiaTesfaye", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sophia Tesfaye", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, Conservatives, Karl Rove, Republicans, Sen.
