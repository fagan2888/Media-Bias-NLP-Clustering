Here\u2019s a look at some other candidate blunders.\n\nBen Carson\u2019s campaign admitted that the GOP presidential candidate fabricated a story about being admitted to West Point on a full scholarship.\n\nIn his book \u201cGifted Hands,\u201d Carson describes dining with Gen. William Westmoreland in 1969, who had just gotten back from Vietnam. Following dinner with the general, the book claims, Carson was offered a full scholarship to West Point.\n\nNice story if true. It wasn\u2019t.\n\nThis has us thinking two things: How will this affect Carson\u2019s campaign, and what are some of the other biggest gaffes by presidential candidates?\n\nLuckily for you, we compiled a list of seven of the biggest presidential candidate blunders, which includes Texas\u2019 own Rick Perry and Ted Cruz\n\nRick Perry: \u201cOops.\u201d\n\nRick Perry never looked the same to voters after the now-infamous \u201coops,\u201d moment during a Republican presidential debate in 2012. When the former Texas governor was explaining his tax plan Perry said, \u201cIt\u2019s three agencies of government that when I get there are gone. Commerce, education and the um, what\u2019s the third one there?\u201d Then for just under a minute Perry seemed to have a total brainfreeze, eventually resulting in him uttering, \u201cSorry, oops.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Kerry: Flip flopping\n\nKerry built a reputation of changing his mind on issues for political reasons before he ran against George Bush in 2004. But his statement that, \u201cI actually did vote for the $87 billion, before I voted against it,\u201d established him to many as a flip-flopper. That reputation hurt his bid for election, and the quote appeared in a number of attack ads.\n\nHoward Dean: The Scream\n\nThe former governor of Vermont was building up steam in his campaign for the Democratic nomination for president until he was derailed by a soundbite. After losing in the 2004 Iowa caucus, Dean attempted to rally his supporters by listing states he was going to win. But he got a little too excited. At the end of his list he let out a scream, which quickly became material for late night comedians and hurt his reputation as a serious candidate.\n\nAl Gore: Creating the Internet\n\nDuring an interview during a primary race in the presidential election of 2000, Al Gore gave himself a little too much credit. When asked about his domestic policy accomplishments, then-Vice President Gore said, \u201cDuring my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet.\u201d He gained a reputation for exaggeration.\n\nMitt Romney: 47 percent\n\nMitt Romney was already facing criticisms that he was \u201cout of touch,\u201d during the 2012 presidential election when a secretly recorded video of a fundraising event was leaked. During a speech Romney talked about the 47 percent of Americans who don\u2019t pay income tax, stating that they believe they were \u201centitled to health care, to food, to housing, you-name-it.\u201d He then said \u201cit\u2019s not my job to worry about those people.\u201d Many saw it validation of his reputation.\n\nTed Cruz: Signing up for \u201cObamacare\u201d\n\nA staunch opponent to President Obama\u2019s politics, Ted Cruz did not help himself when he signed his family up for the Affordable Care Act, one of Obama\u2019s highest priority policies. The decision came after the Texas Senator\u2019s wife decided to take a leave of absence from her job to help support the campaign. Cruz is still alive in the race, but this might be a tough subject for him to defend.\n\nDan Quayle: \u201cYou\u2019re no Jack Kennedy\u201d\n\nWhile Quayle was a candidate for vice president, this blunder did irreparable damage to his reputation. During the VP debate, Quayle likened himself to former president John F. Kennedy, saying that he had as much experience in the senate as JFK did when he ran for president. His opponenent, Lloyd Bentsen didn\u2019t buy it. He stated, \u201cI served with Jack Kennedy, I knew Jack Kennedy, Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you\u2019re no Jack Kennedy.\u201d The putdown was met with applause from the debate crowd.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Round Rock, TX Patch", "description": "The GOP candidate admitted he lied about receiving a full scholarship to West Point.
