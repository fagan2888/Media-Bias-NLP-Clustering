Prices are the result of a hidden collusion between insurers and providers; the consumer has little recourse in determining the accuracy or equity of charges \u2013 much less the ability to gain enough information to make an informed purchase. But one consumer group in California is trying to change that.\n\nView Today\u2019s Highest CD Rates\n\nPriceCheck, a crowdsourced database of healthcare costs, launched earlier this year through the efforts of two California public broadcasting stations and ClearHealthCosts.com.

These are not 'average' prices either. You do not use 'average price' to shop for a car or a computer \u2013 you want the real price. Instead, we asked members of our public media audience in California to share, anonymously, what they and their insurers actually paid.\"", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "article", "layout": "main", "description": "A consumer website crowdsources the costs of common medical tests and procedures.", "author": "Hal Bundrick", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "A consumer website crowdsources the costs of common medical tests and procedures.", "title": "The Priceline of Medical Procedures: Bringing Transparency to Healthcare Costs", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/the-priceline-of-medical-procedures-bringing-transparency-to-healthcare-costs", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/surgeons-mslarge.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/surgeons-mslarge.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Insurance", "date": "2014-11-24T12:30Z", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "keywords": "healthcare, health insurance, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, cost of medical procedures", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Insurance", "tag": "cost of medical procedures", "published_time": "2014-11-24T12:30Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1608888"}, "guid": 12965021, "twitter": {"description": "A consumer website crowdsources the costs of common medical tests and procedures.", "title": "The Priceline of Medical Procedures: Bringing Transparency to Healthcare Costs", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/the-priceline-of-medical-procedures-bringing-transparency-to-healthcare-costs", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/surgeons-mslarge.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/surgeons-mslarge.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "healthcare, health insurance, Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, cost of medical procedures"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde801\"", "article_summary": "View Today\u2019s Highest CD RatesPriceCheck, a crowdsourced database of healthcare costs, launched earlier this year through the efforts of two California public broadcasting stations and ClearHealthCosts.com.\nBy soliciting information from listeners, the group has gathered hundreds of real-life charges for common medical tests and procedures into a free, searchable database.\nInstead, we asked members of our public media audience in California to share, anonymously, what they and their insurers actually paid.\"\nYou do not use 'average price' to shop for a car or a computer \u2013 you want the real price.\n\"Because there was no database where consumers could easily look up costs, we created one,\" Aliferis adds."}
