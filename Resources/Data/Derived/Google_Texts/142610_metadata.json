The majority of hospitals (72 percent) used reusable sharps containers.\n\nWhen analyzed in conjunction with Medicare data on the rates of C. diff infections, hospitals that used single-use sharps containers had significantly lower rates of C. diff infections, according to a presentation by Monika Pogorzelska-Maziarz, Ph.D., assistant professor at the Jefferson School of Nursing in Philadelphia.\n\n\"These findings, while they do not confirm a direct correlation between protocols for sharps disposal and risk of healthcare-associated infection, do raise important questions about the potential role that reusable sharps containers may play in pathogen transmission,\" Pogorzelska-Maziarz said in an announcement about the study, which was funded by BD Medical, a medical technology company.\n\nWhile hospitals take steps to stop the spread of C. diff, one study found many fall short when it comes to antibiotic stewardship programs. The spread of drug-resistant superbugs, including C. diff, has also been linked to shortages of key antibiotics, according to one study, FierceHealthcare previously reported.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- see the poster presentation of the study (.pdf)\n\n- read the study announcement\n\nRelated articles:\n\nAntibiotic stewardship can curb rise of deadly superbugs\n\nAntibiotic shortages ratchet up superbugs' threat to patient safety\n\nWhite House plan calls for aggressive measures against superbugs\n\nNumber of C. diff incidents on the rise\n\nStudy reveals Clostridium difficile spreads differently than hospitals thought\n\nClostridium difficile taking spotlight as killer superbug\n\nTargeted screening can reduce spread of C. diff infection\n\nC. diff room infection plummets with dedicated disinfecting teams", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new study\u00a0found the rates of\u00a0C. difficile\u00a0infections, commonly referred to as\u00a0C. diff, were 15 percent higher in hospitals that use reusable sharps containers than in hospitals that use single-use disposable containers.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "A new study\u00a0found the rates of\u00a0C. difficile\u00a0infections, commonly referred to as\u00a0C. diff, were 15 percent higher in hospitals that use reusable sharps containers than in hospitals that use single-use disposable containers.", "title": "Reusable sharps containers may spread C. diff in hospitals", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/reusable-sharps-containers-may-spread-c-diff-hospitals/2015-06-29", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "C. diff,C. difficile,healthcare-associated infections,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,sharps disposal", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "The majority of hospitals (72 percent) used reusable sharps containers.\nThe rates of C. difficile or C. diff.\nWhile hospitals take steps to stop the spread of C. diff, one study found many fall short when it comes to antibiotic stewardship programs.\nWhen analyzed in conjunction with Medicare data on the rates of C. diff infections, hospitals that used single-use sharps containers had significantly lower rates of C. diff infections, according to a presentation by Monika Pogorzelska-Maziarz, Ph.D., assistant professor at the Jefferson School of Nursing in Philadelphia.\nThe spread of drug-resistant superbugs, including C. diff, has also been linked to shortages of key antibiotics, according to one study, FierceHealthcare previously reported."}
