It\u2019s worth noting their two different but complementary approaches to the 2014 midterms.\n\nRomney appeared on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d Wednesday and shared the respectable GOP line: When Republicans win back the Senate, they\u2019ll \u201cpass bills\u201d and \u201cend gridlock.\u201d Of course, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has repeatedly promised that his party will pass bills they know the president will veto, first and foremost a repeal of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cGridlock\u201d is guaranteed to continue with the GOP in charge; it will likely get worse if Senate Republicans tie the administration up in phony investigations aping their friends in the House.\n\nRomney is lying about his party\u2019s governing agenda \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have a governing agenda \u2013 but it\u2019s a respectable lie, so he got a pass.\n\nMeanwhile, the party\u2019s other leader, Rush Limbaugh, is having a lot of fun with the racial undercurrent of the race, in which the party without an agenda is appealing to white voters based on their hatred of our first black president. On Tuesday Limbaugh crowed to his listeners about the way President Obama is threatening \u201cfive white women\u201d in tough red-state Senate races.\n\nHere you have five white women seeking reelection, they desperately need the black turnout. We just had a story today that in New Orleans only 5% of the black vote\u2019s voted in early vote for [Louisiana Sen.] Mary Landrieu\u2026if that\u2019s all they get then it\u2019s sayonara. And yet here\u2019s the first black president, Barack Hussein Obama, and none of these white women want him anywhere near their campaign. So how do we explain this? The explanation is the guy is toxic and will cause others who might want to vote for these white women to stay home. So they don\u2019t want him anywhere near their campaign. And he said, \u201cI don\u2019t care, I don\u2019t blame \u2019em. They just gotta do what they gotta do to get elected.\u201d In the meantime, the irony is the first black president is an albatross around the necks of five white women who need the black vote because he will hurt.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While Mitt Romney claims GOP Senate will end gridlock, Limbaugh crows about \u201cwhite women\u201d being threatened by Obama", "title": "Rush Limbaugh\u2019s gross closing argument: How GOP still relies on race-baiting", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "While Mitt Romney claims GOP Senate will end gridlock, Limbaugh crows about \u201cwhite women\u201d being threatened by Obama", "title": "Rush Limbaugh\u2019s gross closing argument: How GOP still relies on race-baiting", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/29/rush_limbaughs_gross_closing_argument_how_gop_still_relies_on_race_baiting/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/rush_limbaugh7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While Mitt Romney claims GOP Senate will end gridlock, Limbaugh crows about \u201cwhite women\u201d being threatened by Obama", "title": "Rush Limbaugh\u2019s gross closing argument: How GOP still relies on race-baiting", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/rush_limbaugh7.jpg", "creator": "@joanwalsh", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Joan Walsh", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2014 elections, 2016 Elections, Mary Landrieu, Mitt Romney, Morning Joe, President Obama, Reince Priebus, Rush Limbaugh, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And yet here\u2019s the first black president, Barack Hussein Obama, and none of these white women want him anywhere near their campaign.\nOn Tuesday Limbaugh crowed to his listeners about the way President Obama is threatening \u201cfive white women\u201d in tough red-state Senate races.\nThe explanation is the guy is toxic and will cause others who might want to vote for these white women to stay home.\nHere you have five white women seeking reelection, they desperately need the black turnout.\nThey just gotta do what they gotta do to get elected.\u201d In the meantime, the irony is the first black president is an albatross around the necks of five white women who need the black vote because he will hurt."}
