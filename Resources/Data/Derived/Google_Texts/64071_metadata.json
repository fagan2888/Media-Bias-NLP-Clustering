To some, they are ruthless drug smugglers who deserve to die. To others, rehabilitated do-gooders who deserve to live. The question of which characterization is correct has threatened ties between two once-close countries, both convinced they are right.\n\nAustralia\u2019s fight to save Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran from imminent execution, and Indonesia\u2019s fight to maintain control of its own legal system, has devolved into a diplomatic battle rife with accusations of hypocrisy, power plays and moral superiority. And it serves as a stark reminder of why the death penalty is often considered the ultimate diplomatic challenge: How do you negotiate the non-negotiable?\n\n\u201cFor a diplomat, the death penalty cases are always the hardest ones because they involve a supreme act of sovereignty \u2014 the foreign state believing it has the right to take the life of someone that\u2019s committed a crime \u2014 but also a supreme loss of sovereignty that a country isn\u2019t able to protect its citizens overseas,\u201d said Andrew Carr, an international relations expert at The Australian National University. \u201cYou get the greatest clash of moral values in that some states believe this is right and proper to be applied and other states believe it\u2019s quite abhorrent.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s inevitably tension whenever one country tries to tell another how to conduct its business. That becomes even more acute in death penalty cases, which involve the most extreme human emotions and become, unwittingly or not, symbols of a nation\u2019s strength \u2014 or lack thereof.\n\nThe Australian drug smugglers\u2019 case is a prime example of that. Chan and Sukumaran were arrested in 2005 and sentenced to death for planning to smuggle 8.3 kilograms (18 pounds) of heroin to Australia from Bali. Australia, which long ago abolished the death penalty, pleaded for clemency, arguing the men have been rehabilitated. Indonesia maintains the ultimate punishment is necessary to protect its citizens from a national drug crisis.\n\nIndonesian leaders, meanwhile, bristled at Australia\u2019s attempts to intervene in what they consider a domestic justice issue. \u201cWe stress normally that people in foreign countries are subject to that country\u2019s jurisdiction and that its laws may be different from ours. But in this case, we\u2019re saying we find the death penalty so repugnant that we want you to change the application of your law \u2014 and that\u2019s not entirely consistent,\u201d said Geoffrey Miller, an Australian who spent 40 years working as a diplomat in Japan, Korea and New Zealand. \u201cThe whole issue is so emotive and it\u2019s so final \u2026 it\u2019s understandable that our government is making a major effort. But I think there\u2019s a certain awkwardness in it.\u201d\n\nThat awkwardness can lead to verbal stumbles that threaten negotiations. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott vowed not to let Chan and Sukumaran\u2019s case jeopardize the countries\u2019 close ties. And yet that\u2019s exactly what happened when Abbott suggested the men deserved leniency because Australia gave Indonesia $1 billion in aid after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.\n\nThe response from Indonesia\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir, was sharp. \u201cThreats are not part of diplomatic language,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd from what I know, no one responds well to threats.\u201d\n\nBut if threats don\u2019t work, what does?\n\n\u201cOne challenge is balancing the need to win concessions from local officials, appease foreign outrage, and build political capital to use in future diplomatic negotiations,\u201d Wesley Kendall, author of \u201cThe Death Penalty and U.S. Diplomacy,\u201d said by e-mail.\n\nThat\u2019s no small feat. Consider the 2011 execution of Mexican national Humberto Leal, which stoked tensions among Mexico, the U.S. government and the state of Texas. Under pressure from Mexico, President Barack Obama had pleaded with then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry to stop the execution of Leal, who raped and murdered a Texas teen. Officials never told Leal he could contact the Mexican consulate for help, which the International Court of Justice later ruled to be a violation of his rights. The Obama administration said Leal should be spared in light of that ruling, though Congress never ordered the states to comply with it.\n\nIn a letter supporting legislation that could have given Leal an avenue for appeal had it passed before he was executed, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Attorney General Eric Holder wrote: \u201cThe United States is best positioned to demand that foreign governments respect consular rights with respect to U.S. citizens abroad when we comply with these same obligations for foreign nationals in the United States.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indonesia executions show hurdles of death penalty diplomacy", "title": "Indonesia executions show hurdles of death penalty diplomacy", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Indonesia executions show hurdles of death penalty diplomacy", "title": "Indonesia executions show hurdles of death penalty diplomacy", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/07/indonesia_executions_show_hurdles_of_death_penalty_diplomacy/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/australia-death-penalty-diplomacy.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Indonesia executions show hurdles of death penalty diplomacy", "title": "Indonesia executions show hurdles of death penalty diplomacy", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/australia-death-penalty-diplomacy.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kristen Gelineau", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea22\"", "article_summary": "Australia, which long ago abolished the death penalty, pleaded for clemency, arguing the men have been rehabilitated.\nAnd it serves as a stark reminder of why the death penalty is often considered the ultimate diplomatic challenge: How do you negotiate the non-negotiable?\nThat becomes even more acute in death penalty cases, which involve the most extreme human emotions and become, unwittingly or not, symbols of a nation\u2019s strength \u2014 or lack thereof.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsSYDNEY (AP) \u2014 Inside a remote island prison in Indonesia, two Australians facing death by firing squad await word of their fate.\n\u201cOne challenge is balancing the need to win concessions from local officials, appease foreign outrage, and build political capital to use in future diplomatic negotiations,\u201d Wesley Kendall, author of \u201cThe Death Penalty and U.S. Diplomacy,\u201d said by e-mail."}
