Mother Catherine Spalding becomes the first woman to be honored with a statue in Louisville with its installation along Sixth Street at the foot of the Cathedral of the Assumption. 7/26/15 (Photo: Marty Pearl/Special to The C-J)Buy Photo\n\nSeveral hundred people, many of them Catholic Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, gathered Sunday outside the Cathedral of Assumption to dedicate the first statue of a historic woman on public space in Louisville.\n\nMother Catherine Spalding, bronze and standing a little over five-feet tall, with two orphan children in tow, took her spot outside the Cathedral where she taught students, cared for children whose parents had died, and worked to heal people with cholera in the early 19th century.\n\n\u201cI can imagine that Catherine is delighted to be back on the streets of Louisville where she found so much need and so many collaborators \u2026 and to be portrayed with her beloved orphans must give her great joy,\u201d said Susan Gatz, president of the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth.\n\nGatz said the unveiling was particularly special because a number of the order\u2019s sisters from India and Belize were in town for meetings and were able to attend.\n\nSpalding plays an important, yet often overlooked, role in Louisville\u2019s history.\n\nShe co-founded the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth outside Bardstown \u2014 a religious order that has taught thousands and thousands of children in many of Louisville\u2019s parochial schools going back 200 years.\n\nShe founded schools that eventually became Presentation Academy and Spalding University. She also started St. Joseph\u2019s Infirmary as well as the St. Vincent orphanage. Her order started and founded and staffed numerous other hospitals and schools throughout Kentucky and beyond.\n\nThe religious order\u2019s mission is now worldwide with missions in Central America, Asia and Africa.\n\nMary Margaret Mulvihill, a member of the church, a 1960 Presentation Academy graduate, and chairwoman of the statue steering committee, said the statue stands for more than just Spalding\u2019s contributions, which she said are many.\n\n\u201cThis statue is to honor all women who are truly the backbone of the church,\u201d Mulvihill said.\n\nThe statue, created by Louisville sculptor Raymond Graf, has been nearly 10 years in the making. It was originally proposed in 2006 by the church\u2019s former pastor, and was put on hold after the economy crashed in 2008.\n\nIt was revived a few years later and finally became a reality Sunday with the official unveiling. Archbishop Joseph Kurtz was on hand to bless the statue.\n\nGatz said the Sisters of Charity were allowed input on the statue such as suggesting minor changes to ensure Spalding\u2019s habit and bonnet were historically correct.\n\nEleanor Jordan, executive director of the Kentucky Commission on Women, praised the placement of the statue and said there need to be more statues honoring the accomplishments of women in Kentucky, which are often forgotten.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want my granddaughter and I don\u2019t want your granddaughter to have to wait until she\u2019s enrolled in a women\u2019s studies program to know that she has dozens of models to emulate,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nReporter Joseph Gerth can be reached at (502) 582-4702.
