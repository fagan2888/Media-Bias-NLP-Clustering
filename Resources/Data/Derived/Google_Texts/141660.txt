"It makes me want to cry," said Tina Spetzman, a Sarpy County dispatcher of 30 years.

Co-workers, friends and strangers united.

"I've heard a lot of buzz about it so wanted to come and show her our support," said fundraiser supporter Tami Phillips.

Pancakes and raffle tickets were sold to help Tina Spetzman pay her medical bills.

"I'm just grateful to everybody," Tina Spetzman said.

Tina Spetzman, a mother and wife, has had a chain of health concerns since September 2014.

She had a torn aorta in her heart and then suffered a stroke during open heart surgery. Following her heart surgery she had a brain aneurysm.

Her son and husband keep a close eye on her.

"This just proves how much support she has," said Dean Stetzman, Tina Stetzman's husband.

Her colleagues are answering her call for help.

"I think it's really wonderful that through this the community can be aware of dispatchers and how much they give to the community," said Jessica Manning, of the Sarpy County Sheriff's Office.

"(This is) definitely going to help me pull through, a lot of good people," Tina Spetzman said.

Sunday's event raised about $20,000.
