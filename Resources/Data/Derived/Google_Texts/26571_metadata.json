It\u2019s like you\u2019re being raped and the guy is telling you, \u2018Sorry, my penis is in you. Nothing you can do about it.'\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018No, you\u2019re raping me!'\u201d Coulter added, as her audience oohed and laughed.\n\nThe firebrand conservative didn\u2019t give her usual solo speech on the main stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference this weekend, despite being given a speaking slot in 2013. Instead, Coulter was slated to debate a liberal pundit, Mickey Kaus, in front of the CPAC audience on Saturday afternoon.\n\nBut in the morning, she spent her time with an even more friendly crowd than the CPAC audience: A group of right-wing bloggers. Coulter spoke at a packed immigration briefing organized by Phyllis Schlafly\u2019s Eagle Forum at the Hampton Inn & Suites, just across the street from CPAC.\n\nAnd in playing to her home crowd, Coulter was even more bombastic than usual, arguing that no other issue aside from immigration was even worth talking about for conservatives. She openly criticized the broken immigration system and bashed those who accept that the influx of immigrants into the U.S. is just the way things are \u2014 by comparing it to rape.\n\nCoulter argued that amnesty hurts low-wage workers, many of whom are minorities. She slammed pro-amnesty Republicans, but reserved her strongest venom for the leading immigration reformer of the GOP, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).\n\n\u201cMy whole life, I\u2019ve heard, \u2018Republicans are racist, don\u2019t like black people, don\u2019t care about black people,'\u201d she said. \u201cI never believed it until I read Marco Rubio\u2019s amnesty bill.\u201d\n\nEven Fox News, a network on which Coulter is a regular guest, couldn\u2019t escape her criticism. She accused the hosts of avoiding Republicans\u2019 weak stance on immigration and focusing instead on issues that make GOP members of Congress look good.\n\n\u201cWith the Republicans, it\u2019s like the invasion of the body snatchers,\u201d Coulter said.\n\nShe argued that if Republicans don\u2019t fight amnesty, the party has no hope of ever winning a presidential election again. And when it comes to the rumored 2016 presidential contenders, Coulter isn\u2019t giving away her endorsement easily.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re pretty bad,\u201d she admitted.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Conservative commentator Ann Coulter bashed the United States immigration system on Saturday, comparing the 'unnatural' influx of immigrants \u2014 both legal and illegal \u2014 to being raped.", "title": "Ann Coulter compares U.S. immigration system to being raped - Red...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2012/02/tdionisopoulos_avatar-400x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/03/08/ann-coulter-compares-u-s-immigration-system-to-being-raped/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "immigration-reform", "published_time": "2014-03-08T17:20:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-10T18:29:34+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9bc1\"", "article_summary": "Conservative commentator Ann Coulter bashed the United States immigration system on Saturday, comparing the \u2018unnatural\u2019 influx of immigrants \u2014 both legal and illegal \u2014 to being raped.\nAnd when it comes to the rumored 2016 presidential contenders, Coulter isn\u2019t giving away her endorsement easily.\nInstead, Coulter was slated to debate a liberal pundit, Mickey Kaus, in front of the CPAC audience on Saturday afternoon.\nShe argued that if Republicans don\u2019t fight amnesty, the party has no hope of ever winning a presidential election again.\nBut in the morning, she spent her time with an even more friendly crowd than the CPAC audience: A group of right-wing bloggers."}
