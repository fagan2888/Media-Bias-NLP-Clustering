But there is an incredible amount of waste in the system.\n\nAs a pediatric ophthalmologist, I see children every day who were prescribed glasses, paid for by Medicaid, that are barely stronger than a car\u2019s windshield.\n\nNumerous studies have shown that childhood vision screening is much cheaper and just as effective as routine annual eye exams (mandated by New Mexico Medicaid).\n\nAnd I\u2019m just one specialty \u2013 if you add up the waste across other specialties the dollar amount is staggering!\n\nBut the waste does not stop with our medical system: New Mexico taxpayers must foot the bill for our Rail Runner train that loses $18 million every year.\n\nSo why is it so important to fund Medicaid?\n\nThe majority of New Mexican children are insured by Medicaid, supporting up to 90 percent of the children and families in some areas. Many medical practices, especially those in rural areas, rely heavily on Medicaid funding to stay afloat; as expenses rise practices will close and more doctors will leave the state.\n\nSince health care is one of the largest industries in our state, this will have a big ripple effect \u2013 more unemployment, less gross-receipts tax collected and less people will want to move to our state.\n\nIn a nutshell, the short-term cuts will actually cost the state more in the long-term.\n\nAccording to KidsCount, New Mexico is the second worst state in the nation for a child to live based on economic well-being, education, health and family. Medicaid cuts will create even more misery.\n\nWe already have a severe doctor shortage in nearly every specialty \u2013 currently there are no pediatric rheumatologists in New Mexico, so families must travel to Denver or Phoenix for care.\n\nDoctor recruitment to New Mexico has always been challenging; now it will be even harder. What good is Medicaid insurance if there are no doctors to take care of our children?\n\nThe ones who will suffer the most are the ones who can\u2019t vote \u2013 our children. New Mexico children have a tough life already, and these cuts send a clear message to New Mexico families: \u201cYour children do not matter.\u201d\n\nThe only way this will change is if a large number of citizens contact the N.M. Human Services Division, state legislators and Gov. Susana Martinez to tell them to fully fund Medicaid.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Human Services Division and New Mexico legislators are cutting reimbursement to Medicaid doctors ...", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Dr. Todd Goldblum | Pediatric Ophthalmologist", "og": {"url": "http://www.abqjournal.com/778478/fee-cuts-dont-improve-medicaid-care-budget.html", "image": "http://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/plugins/journal-open-graph/img/albuquerque-journal.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "The Human Services Division and New Mexico legislators are cutting reimbursement to Medicaid doctors ...", "title": "Fee cuts don't improve Medicaid care, budget"}, "fb": {"pages": 76430478236, "app_id": 419447351433280}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0853\"", "article_summary": "But across the board fee cuts for Medicaid will cause irreparable harm and is the wrong solution to help balance our budget.\nNumerous studies have shown that childhood vision screening is much cheaper and just as effective as routine annual eye exams (mandated by New Mexico Medicaid).\nMedicaid cuts will create even more misery.\nWhat good is Medicaid insurance if there are no doctors to take care of our children?\nThe majority of New Mexican children are insured by Medicaid, supporting up to 90 percent of the children and families in some areas."}
