Trey Radel, R-Fla., who was arrested for purchasing cocaine in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 29, will officially mark his return to Capitol Hill when the new session begins next week, his spokesman told Reuters Friday.\n\nRadel has been absent from Congress for almost six weeks since his arrest, appearing before a D.C. Superior Court judge on Nov. 20 and completing a 28-day treatment program at a clinic in Naples, Fla.\n\nThe 37-year old congressman, who is serving his first term in the House after being elected as a tea party conservative in 2012, purchased 3.5 grams of cocaine in the presence of an undercover police officer in Washington\u2019s Dupont Circle neighborhood. He was arrested shortly thereafter.\n\nIn a statement, Radel welcomed the opportunity to return to his job. \u201cI look forward to getting back to work next week, representing my neighbors in Southwest Florida as they face the burdens of Obamacare, a jobless recovery, and a federal government that continues to spend more than it takes in,\u201d he said.\n\nThe House Committee on Ethics said in December that it would investigate whether Radel ran afoul of any congressional rules or laws related to his status as a member of Congress.\n\nIn an interview on Friday with Gannett News Service, Radel said he recognized the need to \u201crestore a lot of trust and make amends.\n\n\u201cOnly then can I return to what I love doing and what I was elected to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI do look forward to getting back to work with a much clearer head and positive thoughts moving forward.\u201d\n\nHe described his treatment in Naples as \u201clife-changing,\u201d and, according to Gannett, he is enrolled in an outpatient program in D.C. to monitor his sobriety.\n\nAmid calls for his resignation from Gov. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and the Florida Republican Party and despite a growing list of primary contenders making noises about taking on the embattled freshman, Radel has resisted calls to step down immediately, and he has not yet said whether he will seek re-election.\n\nFormer Rep. Connie Mack, R-Fla., who held Radel\u2019s seat before he retired at the end of the last Congress, has also signaled interest in reclaiming his old seat, and he could be a real threat to Radel if he decides to jump in.\n\nStill, Radel told Gannett that his political future is \u201cabsolutely not even a thought in my mind at all, period.\n\n\u201cRight now, the most important things for me are God and family, and with that I'm excited to get back to work to rebuild trust and continue doing the work for the people,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "With a stint in rehab behind him, Florida Republican who was arrested for purchasing cocaine plans return to Capitol Hill next week", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rep-trey-radel-to-return-to-congress-after-cocaine-arrest/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/11/26/b3d9008d-fd00-4057-ab2c-cec28867fc09/thumbnail/1200x630/557b8667ec2341b2714c4dd6376880d6/CTM_1120_CORDES_640x480.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "With a stint in rehab behind him, Florida Republican who was arrested for purchasing cocaine plans return to Capitol Hill next week", "title": "Rep.
