Steve Israel endorsed Suffolk County Legislator Steve Stern on Monday in the race for his North Shore congressional seat, ending months of anticipation about whom he would back as his successor.\n\nIn a news conference at North Hempstead Beach Park in Port Washington, the prominent Huntington Democrat said Stern has shown a \u201cstudious and workhorse approach\u201d to lawmaking in the two decades they have known each other.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the fact that we share a first name that brought me to support Steve Stern,\u201d Israel said. \u201cIt\u2019s that I do believe that he is just a great fit in terms of my own priorities, my own values and my own approach in representing the district.\u201d\n\nIsrael said he has worked more closely with the Dix Hills legislator than the four other Democrats running in the Third Congressional District and has seen his dedication to key Long Island issues, such as supporting veterans and protecting the Long Island Sound.\n\nStern\u2019s progressive credentials and his record of protecting taxpayer money equip him best for the June 28 primary and the likely general election against Republican state Sen. Jack Martins in a district that\u2019s \u201cfar from a slam dunk\u201d for Democrats, Israel said.\n\nOther Democratic candidates include Levittown attorney Jonathan Clarke, former North Hempstead Town Supervisor Jon Kaiman, town Councilwoman Anna Kaplan and former Nassau County Executive Tom Suozzi.\n\nStern\u2019s ability to build an effective campaign and raise money in the first three months of the race also impressed Israel, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running for Congress because I am exactly the kind of leader that can continue Steve Israel\u2019s legacy and continue to build a new vision on a record that I\u2019m very proud of,\u201d Stern said.\n\nSeveral of Israel\u2019s former campaign staff, including campaign manager Isaac Goldberg, joined Stern\u2019s campaign in the early stages of the race after Israel announced in January he would not seek re-election.\n\nIsrael\u2019s endorsement gives Stern a boost after raising $500,000 in the first quarter \u2014 including his and his family\u2019s money \u2014 and getting endorsements last week from Port Washington politicos Martin and Laurie Scheinman.\n\nIsrael said he told Stern he would back him two weeks ago at the Sweet Hollow Diner in Melville after declining to make an early endorsement out of fairness to the other candidates. He said Stern was on an early list of potential successors that also included North Hempstead Supervisor Judi Bosworth, who declined to run in January.\n\nIsrael said he has known Stern since he was a Huntington town councilman before being elected to Congress and watched Stern coach Little League. They since have worked together on local issues since Stern got into the Suffolk Legislature in 2006, Stern said.\n\nIsrael pledged to do \u201cwhatever Steve Stern asks me to do that is legal,\u201d and said to anticipate a TV ad featuring him and Stern.\n\nIsrael said Stern\u2019s funding, record and his personal approach to campaigning will help him overcome his lower name recognition relative to better known candidates, such as Kaiman and Suozzi.\n\n\u201cName recognition in this environment ain\u2019t what it used to be,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked for comment on Israel\u2019s endorsement, Suozzi\u2019s campaign manager Michael Florio said, \u201cVoters are looking for a leader like Tom Suozzi who has a track record of standing up to powerful interests to get things done for people.\u201d\n\nKaiman looks forward to working with Israel \u201conce we win the primary and we are all on the same side again,\u201d campaign manager Jeff Guillot said in a statement, also citing the campaign\u2019s support from former U.S. Rep. Gary Ackerman.\n\nWhile Kaplan has appeared publicly with Israel several times, campaign manager Reginald Johnson said it is \u201ccompletely understandable that he would support a fellow Huntington politician\u201d and that Kaplan will continue to focus on \u201claying out her vision on how to make the district a more affordable place to live, raise a family and retire.\u201d\n\nClarke said he found Israel\u2019s endorsement \u201cvery, very unfortunate\u201d because he\u2019s supporting a candidate who does not support meaningful campaign finance reform despite saying he\u2019s tired of the congressional fundraising cycle.\n\n\u201cI just think that it\u2019s very disingenuous and really shows the true colors of Steve Israel,\u201d Clarke said.\n\nMartins campaign strategist E. O\u2019Brien Murray said he thinks Israel\u2019s endorsement will hurt Stern by linking him with \u201cNancy Pelosi, Obamacare, higher taxes, out of control spending and partisan gridlock,\u201d adding that Martins has support from Republicans, Democrats and independents.\n\n\u201cSteve Israel will help Steve Stern the same way Steve Israel\u2019s support of other Democrats gave Republicans the largest majority since the 1920s,\u201d Murray said in an email.\n\nAlso in the Third District, the National Republican Congressional Committee named Martins one of 11 nationwide \u201ccontenders\u201d in its \u201cYoung Guns\u201d program for up-and-coming candidates.\n\nMartins has backing from the Nassau, Suffolk and Queens Republican committees but faces a possible primary challenge from Glen Cove financial investigator Philip Pidot.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "The Island Now", "description": "U.S. Rep.
