On April 11, the NRA board of directors were announced at the Nashville convention, and they included Grover Norquist, the NRA board member over whom Glenn Beck threatened to quit the NRA.

According to Mediate.com, in mid-March Beck threatened to quit the NRA if they did not end their relationship with Norquist. Beck said these things due to his concern that Norquist had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, and he claimed that the NRA reacted to his concerns by launching an investigation into Norquist.

Beck then made clear what he intended to do if Norquist were re-elected: “If this man is elected, or re-elected and confirmed on the board of the NRA, I may drop my membership in the NRA.”

We are about to find out how serious Beck’s commitment to quitting really is, because Norquist’s re-election to the board was announced on April 11.

The Hill reports that Beck already quit the GOP over “Obamacare and illegal immigration.”

Center for Security Policy president Frank Gaffney also voiced concerns about Norquist, and Norquist responded by saying the allegations against him were old charges that were simply being recycled.

He was re-elected in a board election that was nothing if not ordinary.
