But they were also hard to take seriously given her history on this issue. While condemning overincarceration, she glided over her own role in promoting it and exaggerated her efforts to correct it. She referred only obliquely to the war on drugs, which has played an important role in sending nonviolent offenders to prison. And three decades after the prison population began the dramatic climb that she now considers shameful, Clinton offered almost no specific ideas for reversing it, which makes her look like a dilettante compared to politicians in both major parties who have given the issue serious thought.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee promoted the overincarceration she now condemns.", "title": "Why Hillary Clinton Lacks Credibility on Criminal Justice Reform", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/05/01/why-hillary-clinton-lacks-credibility-on", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14304990666540.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee promoted the overincarceration she now condemns.", "title": "Why Hillary Clinton Lacks Credibility on Criminal Justice Reform", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14304990666540.jpg", "creator": "@jacobsullum", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "War on Drugs", "published_time": "2015-05-01T16:59:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/jacob-sullum"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "On Wednesday, Hillary Clinton gave a speech in which she called for \"real reforms\" to \"end the era of mass incarceration.\"\nIn my latest Forbes column, I explain why Clinton has a credibility problem on this issue:This week Hillary Clinton delivered what The New York Times called \"an impassioned plea to mend the nation's racial fissures and overhaul an 'out-of-balance' criminal justice system.\"\nShe referred only obliquely to the war on drugs, which has played an important role in sending nonviolent offenders to prison.\nFor critics who have long argued that our criminal justice system puts too many people behind bars for too long, Clinton's words of outrage were welcome.\nIn a speech at Columbia University, the Democratic Party's presumptive presidential nominee noted that \"the United States has less than 5 percent of the world's population\" but \"almost 25 percent of the world's total prison population.\""}
