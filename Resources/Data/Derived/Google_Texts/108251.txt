She helped preserve the Lakota language, protect sacred sites and species, and founded The Buffalo Field Campaign in 1997. Rosalie Little Thunder, Lakota, walked on August 9.

Vi Waln, in the blog Sicangu Scribe, called Little Thunder “one of our libraries.”

“I was very privileged to have worked with Rosalie on several projects. Her determination to help the Lakota people evolve out of the colonized mindset many have succumbed to was inspirational,” Waln wrote. “A Lakota woman of Rosalie’s caliber is hard to find in today’s modern, assimilated society.”

Waln also pointed out Little Thunder’s involvement in activism. Little Thunder spoke out against the buffalo being slaughtered at Yellowstone National Park and even organized a National Day of Prayer for them. Most recently, Little Thunder was involved with the movement against the Keystone XL pipeline.

“Her legacy is our current history. She was taken to boarding schools, she survived and became a life long peace activist and teacher. She is a descendant of great Lakota Chiefs, and in her own right, was one of our foremost Peace Chiefs of modern times. She will be missed, but the campaigns she helped form are still going,” said Corey Sundog Mascio in a Facebook message to ICTMN.
