RIPR political analyst Scott MacKay has a preview of what to expect and some New Year's resolutions to suggest to the returning lawmakers.\n\nAs predictable as a winter chill, lawmakers throng Smith Hill tomorrow for the new year. There will be the usual m\u00e9lange of grandstanding, pomposity and first-day-of- school style greetings.\n\nOn opening day, they\u2019ll do little more than say hello, reclaim their seats and adjourn. Then head to one of Providence\u2019s fine eateries or watering holes to get seriously re-acquainted for the session.\n\nIt is neither the best nor the worst of times for Rhode Island. The economy has made a comeback from the ghastly recession. Yet our state hasn\u2019t gotten all the jobs that were lost after the 2008 Wall Street crash. Our neighbors in Connecticut and Massachusetts have.\n\nThis we know: the cast of characters remains the same. Governor Gina Raimondo, House Speaker Nick Mattiello, and Senate President Teresa Paiva Weed all return. This trio is good at the political minuet of publicly showing a united front. When the cameras are rolling and the media present, they pledge to work together for the betterment of the Ocean State. But when the oak doors close at the Statehouse, they bicker like pre-schoolers in the sandbox.\n\nExhibit A is the state\u2019s infrastructure woes. The leadership was great at the news conference under the crumbling bridge; not so good at hammering out a solution. When we last saw them in June, the House refused to enact Raimondo\u2019s truck toll plan that would have raised the money to fix roads and bridges.\n\nSince the crash of the toll plan, there has been much talk about resurrecting a repair program. Yet the details are fuzzy as the morning after New Year\u2019s Eve. Now might be the time for the governor to give the House the details, including locations of tolling gantries, that Mattiello wants so his members don\u2019t have to vote on blind faith on an issue that could be used against them at the polls in November.\n\nAfter the 38 Studios fiasco, there isn\u2019t much stomach at the Statehouse for trusting the lobbyists or the governor. That will be particularly true in an election year, when every lawmaker\u2019s seat is up but the governor isn\u2019t.\n\nSpeaking of 38 Studios, it is well past time for Rhode Island to put this relic of the Don Carcieri-Gordon Fox era behind us. The House Oversight Committee should wrap up the hearings quickly, so that whatever they are trying to decipher doesn\u2019t hamper the state\u2019s strong legal case to recover money from the financial advisers who helped Carcieri and Fox foist this deal on our state\u2019s hard-pressed taxpayers. Curt Schilling, especially, should not be given a stage to generate sympathy for himself while the state\u2019s suit against him is pending. Rhode Island has already recouped about $17 million from law firms due to the lawsuit and is on track to get millions more if lawmakers don\u2019t mess it up.\n\nLawmakers should move quickly to fix the huge loophole they left in the state\u2019s Good Samaritan when they hastily adjourned last year. This provision protects citizens from prosecution when they alert emergency services if someone is in danger of a drug overdose. At a time of rampant opioid abuse, this measure is crucial.\n\nIt\u2019s also time for a serious debate about legalizing pot, a la Colorado and other states. Why not be the first New England state to do this and harvest the tax revenues that will flow to the state? It is inevitable that the Ocean State will take this route after another New England state does so, particularly if it is Massachusetts. There would no way to stop legal marijuana from spilling over from Massachusetts to Rhode Island, so why not be first with a regulation and taxing plan?\n\nThis session will hopefully address in a thoughtful way the cost of health care and the future of HealthSourceRI, the Obamacare program. And dig into education issues, with an emphasis on sorting out the financial implications of the charter school movement. Maybe it\u2019s time to limit the number of charter schools until a path can be cleared for ensuring that these experimental schools don\u2019t drain money from the rest of public education.\n\nDon\u2019t hold your breath on this one, but hopefully, lawmakers will find a way to put themselves back under the umbrella of state ethics and campaign finance laws in a manner the public finds reasonable.\n\nThis is probably too much to wish for, but it would also be wonderful if the Assembly leaders could avoid the last-minute rush to pass hundreds of measures in the wee hours when rules are out the window and lawmakers haven\u2019t a clue on what they are voting for.\n\nIn 1907, a liberal reformer from Providence\u2019s East Side began his first term in the House. A Brown University professor and lawyer, he was appalled by the Assembly\u2019s last minute shenanigans and tried in vain to stop it.\n\nThe rep was Theodore Francis Green, who would later become the state\u2019s New Deal Democratic governor and U.S. Senator. The more things change, the more they stay the same.\n\nScott MacKay\u2019s commentary can be heard every Monday at 6:40 and 8:40 on Morning Edition and at 5:44 on All Things Considered.
