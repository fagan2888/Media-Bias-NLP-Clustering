Recently, Medicare identified 2,225 hospitals that will have payments reduced for a year starting on Oct. 1, totaling approximately $227 million in penalties.\n\nAs a result of these penalties in addition to providing the proper care that patients deserve when they are discharged, hospitals have been realizing that reducing unnecessary hospital readmissions requires integrated, intelligent technology that empowers patients and families in their own medical care. However, that proper care cannot be possible if patients aren\u2019t following their post-discharge instructions.\n\nThis has become a recurrent issue in healthcare; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that 9 out of 10 adults who receive medical advice find it incomprehensible and do not know what to do to take care of themselves, creating a revolving door for healthcare institutions.\n\nTo help combat this, in October 2011, the 145-bed Cullman Regional Medical Center (CRMC) in Cullman, Ala., became a beta site for the San Jose, Calif.-based Vocera's Good to Go technology, which records discharge instructions for patients, families, and other care providers to review any time using any device.\n\nLEAVING PREPARED\n\nUsing Good to Go on an Apple iPod device, CRMC caregivers capture \u201clive\u201d audio instructions as well as educational videos, pictures, and documents that are specific to the care of each patient. After hospital discharge, patients can listen to or review their personal care instructions anytime using any phone, mobile device, or computer to clarify follow-up appointments, medication information and more. Family members and other caregivers can also access the recorded instructions using the patient\u2019s unique ID number and login information, says Cheryl Bailey, R.N., chief nursing officer of CRMC.\n\nBailey says that when the nurse goes in to provide the discharge teaching to the patient, he or she will stop by the charge nurse area and obtain an iPod device. \u201cI keep two or three of these devices in each nursing unit. Nurses will then tell their patients they will record their discharge teaching, so when patients go home they, along with their families, can log in or call and read about their diagnosis. We have an ADT feed that comes from our electronic medical record (EMR) into the solution, and when the nurse logs on with her secure password and pin, she\u2019ll choose the patients name, which is loaded in there. And this is all cloud-based technology, so nothing is residing on the iPod device. It\u2019s all HIPAA-regulated,\u201d Bailey says.\n\nCheryl Bailey, R.N.\n\nNurses choose from several templates, which each contain a specific diagnosis. For example, explains Bailey, there will be a template for congestive heart failure (CHF), which will include educational information, such as constructing a low-sodium diet or learning the importance of weighing yourself every day. And this in addition to the nurse\u2019s discharge instructions, so there is a wealth of information, Bailey says. The nurse also has the option to include an e-mail address and cell phone number of a family member, so they get the same secure access. \u201cWe utilize this system for a multi-disciplinary approach to help better inform our patients and help them understand if they possibly forget something when they get home. They can log on the internet or can phone in and listen to this information as many times as they need,\u201d Bailey says.\n\nDepending on which unit it is, Bailey says she can see anywhere between a 50 to 80 percent pickup rate of patients getting that information. That information is picked up 60 percent by phone and 40 percent by internet, while patients access it more than once 30 percent of the time. \u201cI can see which patients received the discharged recording, which nurse gave it, if patients have access to the information, and how they accessed it, as well as how often.\u201d\n\nAnd so far, the results have been there, boasts Bailey. \u201cWith 30-day readmissions, we have seen a 15 percent decrease. And we have also seen an increase in patient satisfaction. Two questions on the HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) survey focus on the discharge process. We have seen increases of 62 and 63 percent, respectively, on improvement of satisfaction. Our initial goal was to reduce 30-day readmissions, but patient satisfaction has also increased.\u201d\n\nBailey says she attributes that to the accountability factor. \u201cThe staff knows we randomly listen to these recordings, as we want to make sure they are doing a great job providing the teaching. So they do a better job teaching, knowing we are listening. We have heard patients or family members tell the nurse on the recording, \u2018You did a great job with that information. Thank you.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd just as importantly, Bailey says she sees an accountability improvement in regards to the patient. \u201cWhen the nurse says the discharge teaching is being recorded, the patient is more likely to really listen, thinking that if it\u2019s being recorded, it must be important. Rather than focus on the door to go home, the patient is now focusing on the teaching the nurse is giving.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com"}, "article_summary": "And this in addition to the nurse\u2019s discharge instructions, so there is a wealth of information, Bailey says.\nWe have heard patients or family members tell the nurse on the recording, \u2018You did a great job with that information.\nOur initial goal was to reduce 30-day readmissions, but patient satisfaction has also increased.\u201dBailey says she attributes that to the accountability factor.\nRather than focus on the door to go home, the patient is now focusing on the teaching the nurse is giving.\u201d\nAfter hospital discharge, patients can listen to or review their personal care instructions anytime using any phone, mobile device, or computer to clarify follow-up appointments, medication information and more."}
