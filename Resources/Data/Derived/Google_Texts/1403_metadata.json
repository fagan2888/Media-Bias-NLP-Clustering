Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., during the three-day conference in Detroit, Michigan. He\u2019s scheduled to speak a week from Thursday; Warren is slated for a morning address the day after. That same weekend Clinton will be doing a book signing in St. Paul, Minnesota, about a 90-minute flight from Detroit.\n\n[READ: Hillary's Favorability Drops Under 50 Percent]\n\nIt will mark the first time Biden\u2019s talking at the conference and will come at point when the Democratic Party is wrestling with how best to approach the issue of income inequality.\n\n\u201cFrom his longtime support of labor unions to speaking out on important issues like LGBT equality, Vice President Biden has in many ways given heart and soul to this administration,\" said Raven Brooks, executive director of Netroots Nation, in a statement.\n\nClinton, in the midst of a monthlong promotional tour of her book, declined an invite. In one sense, it makes sense for her to avoid the risk of a cool welcome by some of the nation\u2019s most hardened liberals. But if The New Republic\u2019s Noam Scheiber is right, she\u2019s already made great inroads with the group who torpedoed her nomination six years ago.\n\n[ALSO: Why Republicans Picked Cleveland]\n\nNow that two of the Democrat\u2019s top three potential 2016 presidential candidates will be present, Clinton\u2019s absence will only be amplified.\n\nBut she\u2019ll have a surrogate of sorts on her behalf. Ready For Hillary, a pro-Clinton group unaffiliated with the former Secretary of State, is sending its bus to the conference.\n\nWhether attendees are ready to hop on will be a fair measure of how far Clinton has come with the left.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "The Run 2016 [News]", "title": "Joe Biden Heading to Netroots Nation", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "2 of the 3 biggest stars in the Democratic Party are heading to the liberal gala.", "title": "Joe Biden Heading to Netroots Nation", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/run-2016/2014/07/09/joe-biden-heading-to-netroots-nation", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/d8/78/72e5fc974fe0ae194633cdf182cb/140709-joebiden-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Joe Biden Heading to Netroots Nation", "description": "2 of the 3 biggest stars in the Democratic Party are heading to the liberal gala.<br>", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "July 9, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "David Catanese,Pulse,Clinton, Hillary,Biden, Joe,Warren, Elizabeth,Democratic Party,LGBT rights,economy,2016 presidential election,The Run 2016 [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "2 of the 3 biggest stars in the Democratic Party are heading to the liberal gala."}, "article_summary": "The announcement Wednesday that Vice President Joe Biden is heading to Netroots Nation means that two of the three biggest stars in the Democratic Party will attend the largest gala of progressives in the nation this year.\n\u201cFrom his longtime support of labor unions to speaking out on important issues like LGBT equality, Vice President Biden has in many ways given heart and soul to this administration,\" said Raven Brooks, executive director of Netroots Nation, in a statement.\nReady For Hillary, a pro-Clinton group unaffiliated with the former Secretary of State, is sending its bus to the conference.\nBiden will join Sen.
