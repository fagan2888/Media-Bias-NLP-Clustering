They also came four weeks after Del. Terry G. Kilgore (R-Scott) filed legislation to rein in the settlement-purchasing industry, which offers cash upfront to people in exchange for money bound up in structured settlements. Lawyers often recommend the arrangements, in which cash from lawsuits is dispensed in installments over years, to protect vulnerable people from spending a large payout all at once.\n\n\u201cEvery once in a while you hit the sweet spot where your bill addresses something people are interested in,\u201d said Kilgore, who filed the legislation Nov. 30. \u201cWe need to make sure everything\u2019s on the up and up.\u201d\n\nThe Post investigation told the story of burn survivor Terrence Taylor, who as a child was diagnosed with a cognitive impairment and who has sold $11 million in future payments for a small fraction of their current-day value. A similar Post investigation, published in August, led to court reforms to protect recipients of structured settlements in Maryland.\n\n[A flawed system: Making millions off the injured]\n\nView Graphic How an injury victim's structured settlement payments can be sold to an investor\n\nThe Virginia story drew attention to Portsmouth lawyer and delegate-elect Stephen E. Heretick (D), who has worked for more than a dozen settlement-purchasing firms. He has handled thousands of purchase agreements, including 10 involving Taylor.\n\nHeretick, who was elected with strong support from Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) and liberal advocacy groups, called Taylor\u2019s case a \u201csignificant anomaly\u201d among structured-settlement sales and defended the practice, which he said can help people save their homes or afford medical care.\n\n\u201cI plan to serve honorably,\u201d he said. \u201cI am sorry that this, of course, appeared at the time that it did. Nonetheless, we\u2019ve done nothing wrong. I\u2019ve simply followed the law as it\u2019s written and tried to apply it fairly in every case.\u201d\n\nVirginia is among 49 states that require county courts to discern whether a settlement-purchase deal is in the seller\u2019s best interest. But industry experts say there are weaknesses in Virginia\u2019s law: Structured-settlement recipients who want to sell their payments are not obligated to attend hearings, and companies can file their deals anywhere in the state.\n\nKilgore\u2019s bill would require cases to be filed and heard in the jurisdiction where the seller lives and require the seller to appear in person at the hearing. The bill says a purchase application must include a summary of prior transfers as well as notice of the hearing.\n\nThe National Association of Settlement Purchasers said it is aware of flaws in laws around the country and worked with Kilgore on the Virginia bill. \u201cThese reforms and protections, just like similar reforms enacted in Illinois and Wisconsin, provide potential sellers a better opportunity to make informed decisions. Our organization believes that transparency helps deter unscrupulous actors,\u201d NASP President Patricia LaBorde said in a statement.\n\nMaryland\u2019s court system recently reformed its settlement-purchase process after a Post investigation revealed problems with it.\n\n\n\n\n\n[Dimes on the dollar: Fast cash payouts to lead-poisoned victims]\n\nJack Harris, executive director of the Virginia Trial Lawyers Association, said he agreed that reform is necessary to protect people who have structured settlements. In general, such agreements are put in place to ensure a steady flow of monetary support to people who, because of their age or cognitive abilities, are less able to make long-term financial decisions.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very clear that the law is not strong enough,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe very fact that they have a structure indicates that they need protection.\u201d\n\nDel. David B. Albo (R-Fairfax), who generally favors limiting government intervention in people\u2019s financial affairs, said that with structured-settlement purchases, more oversight may be needed. \u201cObviously the current system\u2019s not working,\u201d he said.\n\nDel. Gregory D. Habeeb (R-Salem) said that there are times when sale of a structured settlement makes sense but that the law isn\u2019t working the way it should to catch \u201cbad actors.\u201d\n\nHe also sounded off against McAuliffe and other Democrats who in the June primary supported Heretick over longtime Del. Johnny S. Joannou (D-Portsmouth). Joannou was the only Democrat to oppose McAuliffe\u2019s plan to expand Medicaid coverage in Virginia under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI think it says a lot about the Democratic Party that purports to fight for justice, to protect the disadvantaged,\u201d Habeeb said. \u201cThen they will throw their full backing against someone who has apparently used loopholes to take advantage of people.\u201d\n\nTram Nguyen, co-executive director of New Virginia Majority, a progressive activist group, said she hopes Heretick uses his new role as a legislator to strengthen consumer-protection laws.\n\nJoannou \u201ctook every opportunity to vote against our values and against working families,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re going to hold every other elected official to that same standard, whether it\u2019s Steve [Heretick] or anybody else.\u201d\n\nHeretick said he would probably abstain from voting on Kilgore\u2019s bill in the upcoming legislative session but supports bringing more transparency to the process.\n\n\u201cNobody wants a bad deal,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody wants to end up on the front page of The Washington Post.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "vapolitics", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "A Washington Post investigation adds momentum to a bill filed in the state capital last month.", "title": "In Richmond, calls to reform purchases of structured settlements", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/in-richmond-calls-to-reform-purchases-of-structured-settlements/2015/12/28/afa03726-aceb-11e5-b711-1998289ffcea_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/11/05/Local/Images/vasettle21446751573.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jennaportnoy"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "vapolitics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "afa03726-aceb-11e5-b711-1998289ffcea", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "A Washington Post investigation adds momentum to a bill filed in the state capital last month."}, "article_summary": "A similar Post investigation, published in August, led to court reforms to protect recipients of structured settlements in Maryland.\nTerry G.
