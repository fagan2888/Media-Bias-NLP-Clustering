A new survey shows a majority of people are pleased with government-sponsored health insurance.

If they like their Obamacare plan, maybe they'll stay in their Obamacare plan.

A new survey of people who have purchased Obamacare insurance or enrolled in Medicaid shows relatively high levels of satisfaction with their coverage, as proposed insurance prices for 2017 start to come out.

A total of 77 percent of people with private Obamacare plans and 88 percent of people on Medicaid said they are "very" or "somewhat satisfied" with their coverage, according to the Commonwealth Fund survey.

Those levels are 4 and 5 percentage points lower, respectively, than when people were questioned for a similar survey last year.

Among Obamacare customers, 66 percent rate the coverage as good, very good or excellent. A total of 77 percent of Medicaid enrollees gave it such high marks. Again, these results represented a slight decline from the results in last year's Commonwealth Fund survey.
