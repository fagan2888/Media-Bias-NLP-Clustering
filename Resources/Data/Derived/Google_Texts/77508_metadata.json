Millions of people are visiting their tax preparers \u2014 often so they can get the biggest refund possible. But this year, many of them are also getting advice about health insurance. That\u2019s because next year, under the Affordable Care Act, people will have to pay what could be a hefty tax penalty if they are uninsured for more than three months.\n\nSusana Veamatahau Pau is a tax preparer with Jackson Hewitt Tax Services, which has 6,400 locations nationwide. Like other tax advisers, she sees it as her responsibility to make sure her clients know what\u2019s coming.\n\n\u201cThe government is not the first person they\u2019re going to interact with when they get the penalty,\u201d she says from her office in San Mateo. \u201cIt\u2019s really us.\u201d\n\nPau sees a lot of plumbers and pest control technicians who say they plan to just pay the penalty instead of buying insurance. But she says that\u2019s because there\u2019s a misunderstanding about how much the penalty is. The fine is either $95 or roughly 1 percent of household income \u2014 whichever figure is greater. For people who make $60,000 a year, the fine could be more than $500. Pau\u2019s customers freeze with sticker shock when they hear that.\n\n\u201cThey are not pleased,\u201d she says. \u201cSome are just barely getting refunds. One got a refund that\u2019s like $300. Their penalty is going to pretty much eat that up.\u201d\n\nPenalty Doubles Next Year\n\nNext year will be even more harsh. People will find out the penalty is doubling to 2 percent of income.\n\nBrian Haile is the vice president for health policy at Jackson Hewitt. He says the higher penalty isn\u2019t even the worst of it. For people who find out during their tax appointment this year that they will have to pay a fine, there\u2019s a way out. They have until March 31 to enroll in a health plan. But next year, they could be stuck. The deadline to enroll in health insurance is February 15th.\n\n\u201cSay that they come in on February 17th,\u201d Haile says. \u201cWe tell them that you have to pay 1 percent of income over the filing threshold for last year \u2014 and you\u2019re going to have to pay double that this year for being uninsured.\u201d\n\nAnd, for that person who comes in after the deadline to sign up for a plan, there\u2019s no way out. They will be too late to enroll.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not going to sit well,\u201d Haile says. \u201cSo there\u2019s going to be a lot of public anger about this because the open enrollment periods won\u2019t perfectly align with the tax season.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why his tax advisors are trying to persuade people to sign up for health insurance now.\n\n[Related: Obamacare Explained \u2014 Just for Californians]\n\nThat nudge was helpful to Michael Patterson. His wife has been uninsured for four years. Plans were just too expensive. At their tax appointment they found out she qualified for financial assistance.\n\n\u201cWe were very excited that we might be able to get insurance for her,\u201d Patterson says.\n\nFor freelance musician Rob Shelton help came in the reverse order. He got tax advice not from a tax preparer \u2014 but from his health insurance broker. His income puts him right on the border of qualifying for Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s free health insurance coverage for people who are low income. Or, he could get a federal subsidy to help him buy a private health insurance plan on the Covered California marketplace. His broker suggested some strategic tax moves.\n\nFirst he wondered if he should skip some deductions, effectively giving him a high enough income to move from Medi-Cal to a subsidized plan through Covered California. \u201cOr should I take all my deductions and get into Medi-Cal, which is what I ended up doing,\u201d he says.\n\nH & R Block is also wading into health insurance this year. They set up a new website and a dedicated toll-free number with information on health plans. But the marketing campaign is a bit of a misfire.\n\nTax advisor Guillermo Amoretty pulled up the website at his San Francisco office, showing in a soft green font, \u2018helpth is here.\u2019 \u2018Helpth\u2019 is a combination of the words help and health, Amoretty says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a typo.\u201d\n\nAmoretty may be providing tax advice to others, but It\u2019s unclear if he will take it for himself. He\u2019s 29 and uninsured \u2014 and still deciding whether to get coverage or pay the penalty.\n\n\u201cIt will depend on how much my income will be by the end of the year,\u201d he says.\n\nHe has one more week to figure it out.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The uninsured face a tax penalty up to 1% of income, which could exceed $500 if earning $60,000/year.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"How Tax Preparers Are Encouraging Obamacare Sign Ups\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/03\\/24\\/how-tax-preparers-are-encouraging-obamacare-sign-ups\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-03-24 08:14:28\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-03-25 17:37:11\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":18286,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Tax Penalty\"],\"categories\":[\"Obamacare\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/03\\/SusanPau-copy-e1395635903471.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The uninsured face a tax penalty up to 1% of income, which could exceed $500 if earning $60,000/year.", "title": "How Tax Preparers Are Encouraging Obamacare Sign Ups", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/03/24/how-tax-preparers-are-encouraging-obamacare-sign-ups/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/03/SusanPau-copy-640x480.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "tax penalty", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf8d9\"", "article_summary": "Or, he could get a federal subsidy to help him buy a private health insurance plan on the Covered California marketplace.\nHe got tax advice not from a tax preparer \u2014 but from his health insurance broker.\nIt\u2019s one week to the final deadline to enroll in a health plan, but it\u2019s also tax season.\nBut this year, many of them are also getting advice about health insurance.\nSusana Veamatahau Pau is a tax preparer with Jackson Hewitt Tax Services, which has 6,400 locations nationwide."}
