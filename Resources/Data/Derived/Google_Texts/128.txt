NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — The ruble is having a great week.

Up 3.8% against the dollar, the Russian currency RUBUSD, -0.034615% has outperformed every core-emerging market and Group of 10 rival so far this week. And so far this year, it has gained 11.4% against the dollar — making it the strongest-performing currency of 2015, according to FactSet.

The ruble has benefited from two tailwinds: stabilizing oil prices, and expectations that the Federal Reserve is in no rush to raise interest rates, said Win Thin, global head of emerging-market currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman.

The second factor differentiates it from the currencies of Russia’s oil-producing rivals, most notably the Canadian dollar CADUSD, -0.1308% and the Norwegian krone NOKUSD, +0.0641% both industrial economies.

“[Emerging-market currencies] have got a bit of a bid on the U.S. rate outlook and oil is kind of stabilizing,” Thin said.

West Texas Intermediate crude oil, the U.S. benchmark, slumped Wednesday, giving back a chunk of its gains from earlier in the week, after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said commercial crude inventories increased by a more-than-expected 10.9 million in the week ended April 3.

But the ruble was little-changed after the data.

The ruble famously slumped to record lows in December, as collapsing oil prices and international sanctions battered Russia’s economy.
