Drivers traveling along Castle Oaks Drive will soon have a smoother commute now that Richmond American Homes has agreed to temporarily pave the road.

The agreement, which was made between the homebuilder and Castle Rock earlier this week, calls for paving between the entrance to Cobblestone Ranch/Liberty Village and Autumn Sage Street to begin next week.

Richmond Homes had committed to paving the road once the 1,000th home was built in Cobblestone Ranch, but the economic downturn slowed growth.

There is expected to be one lane in each direction, with a gravel shoulder on each side. The fully paved road, including sidewalks, will be built when the 1,000th home milestone is reached or in 2021, whichever comes first.

Information about road closures for this project is online at CRgov.com.
