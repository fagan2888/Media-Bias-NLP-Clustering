He ultimately gives up after completing roughly 35 and losing out to his 2009 SOTU response.\n\nThe Jindal video is just the latest in a string of Republican attempts at making stuffy, old politicians look like tough-guy everymen that appeal to their voting base.\n\nThe trend started in late July when Kentucky Senator, and presidential hopeful, Rand Paul launched a video series where he destroyed the U.S. tax code in various, manly ways, that included a chainsaw, a wood chipper and a fire.\n\nAt the time, it was original and made quite a bit of buzz.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham followed suit with a video of himself destroying a cell phone with a golf club and a samurai sword after Donald Trump announced Graham\u2019s cell phone number in a national television interview.\n\nThen, Sen. Ted Cruz jumped on the bandwagon out of nowhere with a bizarre video of himself doing questionable Simpson\u2019s impressions, which, as if \u201cexcellent\u201d could possibly be topped, he followed with a remake of a popular rifle-cooked bacon video.\n\nIn rifle-bacon, Cruz, who once took great, belabored, 2nd Amendment pains making a distinction between \u201cmachine guns\u201d and \u201crifles,\u201d cooks bacon on an AR-15 rifle barrel and then takes a bite whilst greasily declaring, \u201cMmmm, machine gun bacon.\u201d\n\nMachine gun: No. Cringeworthy: You be the judge.\n\nFollow Josh on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the most recent iteration of a Republican attempt to create buzz leading up to Thursday's debate, Bobby Jindal challenges \"The Issues\" to a push-up contest.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Severely lagging behind Donald Trump in national polls, some Republican presidential hopefuls have resorted to making viral video attempts to drum up support.
