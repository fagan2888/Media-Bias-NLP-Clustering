Instead, many are paying a larger share of their medical bills, often through deductibles that leave people to pay the full cost of care until they hit a certain dollar limit. And that means not just higher potential costs, but more to understand \u2013 from figuring out how much care costs to handling bills that aren\u2019t always clear.\n\nWhat can people do to better manage their high-deductible plans? Here are some tips from experts.\n\nKnow what your deductible applies to.\n\nThe basic premise of a deductible: You pay the full cost of care until you reach a certain dollar limit, at which point the plan begins chipping in.\n\nBut deductibles work differently depending on the plan. In some cases, they apply to all care (with the exception of certain preventive services; more on that below). In other cases, they only apply to certain services \u2013 often, hospitalizations or imaging are included \u2013 but don\u2019t apply to doctors\u2019 office visits. Some plans have separate deductibles for medical care and prescription drugs.\n\nDeductibles also vary in how they apply to family plans. Take, for example, a plan with a $1,000 deductible for individuals and a $2,000 deductible for families. In some family plans, any one person would only have to meet the $1,000 individual deductible before the plan begins paying toward his or her care. The family would remain responsible for the other covered family members\u2019 expenses until they incur enough costs to meet the remaining $1,000 on the deductible. In other plans, the full family deductible could be met by any individual family member or multiple people.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure how your deductible works after you read your plan documents, call your insurance company\u2019s member services number and ask.\n\nKnow what\u2019s covered at no cost, no matter what your deductible is \u2013 and know the exceptions.\n\nUnder the federal health law, insurance plans must cover certain preventive services at no charge to the member \u2013 regardless of whether they have a deductible or not. Here\u2019s a list of those services.\n\nBut there\u2019s a big caveat to know. In some cases, patients have gone for what they expect to be a no-cost preventive visit and have ended up with a bill. That\u2019s because if they address issues that go beyond the scope of a preventive visit, the doctor\u2019s office can bill them for a different type of visit that isn\u2019t fully paid for by their insurance plan.\n\nState Healthcare Advocate Victoria Veltri said unexpected bills for what began as preventive care are an increasingly common complaint topic for her office.\n\n\u201cFor people who are price-sensitive, they need to ask questions,\u201d she said. She suggested telling the doctor or office staff that you\u2019re coming in for a free preventive visit and want to be sure to know if anything happens that will lead to you getting a bill.\n\nIdeally, she added, doctors would let patients know if the visit moves beyond the covered services in a free preventive visit, even if it\u2019s in the patient\u2019s best interest to address whatever additional issues come up.\n\n\u201cI think it should work from both ends,\u201d Veltri said. \u201cProviders should provide that information, and I think the patient should ask the question.\u201d\n\nLearn to read your 'explanation of benefits.'\n\nHaving a high deductible means you\u2019re more likely to deal with medical bills directly. And that means you\u2019ll have to figure out what you really owe \u2013 which isn\u2019t always easy. While providers might charge a certain amount, the figure that usually matters to you is what amount your insurer has negotiated with the provider.\n\nExperts say you should look not just at your bill but at the \u201cexplanation of benefits\u201d form you get from your insurance company. That form will let you know how much was billed, what the insurance plan paid, and what you owe. Kathy Walsh, principal examiner in the Connecticut Insurance Department\u2019s Consumer Affairs Division, advises people to save explanation of benefits forms and compare them to any bills they receive from health care providers. If they don\u2019t match, call the provider or the insurer.\n\nFor more on how to read explanation of benefits forms, including samples from various insurers, click here.\n\nCheck your medical bills closely.\n\nArielle Levin Becker / The CT Mirror\n\n\u201cMany people will scrutinize their other bills very carefully before they will scrutinize a hospital or provider bill, or even an explanation of benefits from their insurance company,\u201d Veltri said. \u201cMy advice to people is to use the same level of scrutiny that you\u2019d apply if you thought you had a $5 overcharge on your cable bill.\u201d\n\nIn some cases, providers send bills before the claim has been settled with the insurance company \u2013 meaning the patient might get billed for what the insurer would pay, Veltri said.\n\nShe recommended checking the explanation of benefits to make sure it lists the correct provider, date of service and the services you got.\n\nAnd she advised people not to pay until they\u2019ve reviewed both the bill and corresponding explanation of benefits \u2013 and ensured that the charges are accurate.\n\nBe prepared to pay up-front.\n\nIn some cases, health care providers require patients with deductibles to pay a portion or all of what they\u2019ll owe ahead of time, particularly if they\u2019re planning costly services like surgery or a hospital admission.\n\n\u201cPeople have to think of it like it was in the old days with a copayment,\u201d Walsh said. In other words, paying up front, but in this case, it could be significantly more than a $30 or $40 copay.\n\nSave up.\n\nPeople with qualifying high-deductible plans can use health savings accounts to save money on a pre-tax basis to use for their health care expenses.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good way to try to help budget the expenses that they have to pay for toward their deductibles, as well as utilizing those tax-free dollars,\u201d Walsh said.\n\nTo avoid surprises, try to learn the cost of care ahead of time.\n\nAlvin Chang / The CT Mirror\n\nIn some cases, the cost of care for the same service can vary widely by location. To try to find out the cost ahead of time \u2013 so you can plan for the expense or shop for the best price \u2013 experts advise asking your insurance company, since they negotiate the payment rates. (Many insurers offer online cost-calculator tools too.) Before you call, be sure you know the exact procedure or service and, if possible, its billing code. You can also ask your health care provider, although they might not have the negotiated rate as easily available.\n\nA law passed last year aims to make it easier for consumers to learn what their care will cost, but many those provisions don\u2019t take effect for several months.
