When he started the FreezerBurns blog posts and video reviews in 2008, it was in an effort to separate the best from the worst frozen foods by reviewing them. A total of 1,000 frozen items had been eaten and examined in nearly 700 episodes, but his most recent review was his breaking point.\n\nNg introduces the final frozen meal to his viewers by reading and criticizing the package. He reads the meal description, which says contains dragon-shaped breaded chicken nuggets, macaroni and cheese sauce, corn, and bug-shaped fruit snacks. As he eats from each compartment he describes his disappoint in the flavorless and overcooked macaroni, the watery and nutrition-devoid corn, and the \u201cjust not good\u201d breaded nuggets. Once he places the tray down, he carefully explains why he\u2019s disappointed with the meal.\n\n\u201cIt says made with white meat chicken,\u201d Ng says in his last video reviewing the Kid Cuisine Chicken Nuggets frozen meal. \u201cThere may be a little white meat chicken because it says white meat chicken and rib meat. I\u2019m okay with it just being white meat chicken and rib meat, but the fact that this is breaded means that is basically breading with a hint, a hint of chicken on the inside.\u201d\n\nAs a father, the idea of feeding his child one of these meals angered him and he explains the $2 price tag should be irrelevant considering the lack of nutrition that children need to grow into a physically and mentally healthy adult. The brain needs special fuel, such as glucose, vitamins, minerals, and other essential chemicals to run properly, according to neuroscientist Dr. Eric Chudler of the Center for Sensorimotor Neural Engineering. Today, children\u2019s meals just like Kid Cuisine are carbohydrate- and sugar-laden abominations and poor excuses for meals to fill the USDA requirements in many public school cafeterias.\n\nThe health properties of frozen foods are different from fresh foods because of the preservatives, partially hydrogenated oils, and high sodium content that usually consists of 700 to 1,800 milligrams (mg) of salt, while recommended maximum dosage a day is 2,300mg. Yet, the frozen food and beverage industry still flourishes, with sales reaching over $52 billion, according to the Frozen Food Digest.\n\n\"What are we doing people?\u201d Ng says. \u201cThis is Kid Cuisine. We\u2019re feeding this to our kids? This is disgusting. I\u2019m looking at these ingredients; I don\u2019t recognize half of these ingredients. This is horrible. You know what? I can't do this anymore. This is horrible. We should not be feeding our kids this. We should not be eating this frozen food anymore. I'm done with this.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "frozen, food, master, gregory, ng, abruptly, quits, after, reviewing, 1000, frozen, food, items", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The FreezerBurns blog ended when the host gave up after being fed up with unhealthy children's meals.", "title": "Gross Ingredients Prompt 'Frozen Food Master' To Quit Abruptly After 6 Years [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/frozen-food-master-gregory-ng-abruptly-quits-after-reviewing-1000-frozen-food-items-we-301250", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/04/unhealthy-kids-meal-angers-freezerburns-food-host.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The FreezerBurns blog ended when the host gave up after being fed up with unhealthy children's meals.", "title": "Gross Ingredients Prompt 'Frozen Food Master' To Quit Abruptly After 6 Years [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/frozen-food-master-gregory-ng-abruptly-quits-after-reviewing-1000-frozen-food-items-we-301250", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/04/unhealthy-kids-meal-angers-freezerburns-food-host.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/04/unhealthy-kids-meal-angers-freezerburns-food-host.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-09-04T13:43:09-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-04T13:43:08-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The FreezerBurns blog ended when the host gave up after being fed up with unhealthy children's meals."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd753\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere may be a little white meat chicken because it says white meat chicken and rib meat.\nYet, the frozen food and beverage industry still flourishes, with sales reaching over $52 billion, according to the Frozen Food Digest.\n\u201cIt says made with white meat chicken,\u201d Ng says in his last video reviewing the Kid Cuisine Chicken Nuggets frozen meal.\nNg introduces the final frozen meal to his viewers by reading and criticizing the package.\nAfter six years of peeling back plastic and microwaving various meals from the frozen food aisle, Gregory Ng abruptly quit in the middle of reviewing an unhealthy kids meal."}
