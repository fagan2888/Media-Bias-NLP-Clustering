HAVANA (AP) — U.S. sailors were making history as they raced across the Florida Straits to Cuba on Saturday.

An amateur race billed as the “Havana Challenge” was taking place for the first time with U.S. government authorization thanks to the historic easing of tensions that began in December.

Five 16-foot catamarans departed early Saturday from Key West. They were expected to reach Marina Hemingway in Havana by sunset — and perhaps sooner if strong winds in the 90-mile-wide Florida Straits helped them gain speed.

They plan to race Cuban sailors on Tuesday.

Organizers have staged the race in the past without government permission, making it technically illegal. Organizer Joe Weatherby said they received a U.S. Commerce Department license this year and now hope to make it an annual event.
