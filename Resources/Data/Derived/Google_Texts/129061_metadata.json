He said -- and has argued in the court case -- that Democrats are crossing over into Republican primaries, helping to nominate liberals instead of the candidates actual Republicans would want.\n\n\"Until we fix our unconstitutional primary system, Democrats are going to continue to corrupt our primary election and elect nominees who purport to be Republicans who really don't represent the majority of people in the party,\" he said. \"Some people refer to them as liberal Republicans. The reality is many of them are not Republicans to begin with. They're people who identify as Democrats and consider themselves Democrats, but it's during times in which they can influence Republican primaries, they often cross over and do exactly that.\"\n\nAsked for examples of such wayward Republicans, Monforton named U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke and Attorney General Tim Fox.\n\nHe cited their support for the Flathead Water Compact.\n\nZinke told MTN Friday that he wished Monforton \"fair winds and following seas in his retirement.\"\n\nZinke did not directly offer support for the compact Friday. He said legislation to implement the compact (supported this year by the Montana Legislature in a bill signed by Gov. Steve Bullock) is a long way from the House floor. He acknowledged that the compact is a contentious issue, pitting neighbor against neighbor, and Montanans should continue to work toward a solution.\n\nZinke also said that he'd welcome a challenge from Monforton in his re-election to the U.S. house next year.\n\nMonforton is the second Montana House Republican this week to forgo re-election. Three-term MT Rep. Christy Clark (R-Choteau) is taking a position with the Montana Department of Agriculture and not seeking re-election.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "One of the Montana Legislature's most vocal conservatives will step away from his seat.First-term MT Rep Matthew Monforton (R - Bozeman) says he's not running for a second term.Monforton championed...", "author": "Sanjay Talwani - MTN News", "og": {"url": "http://www.krtv.com/story/30228719/monforton-wont-run-for-second-term-in-montana-house-of-representatives", "image": "http://KXLH.images.worldnow.com/images/8984852_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "One of the Montana Legislature's most vocal conservatives will step away from his seat.First-term MT Rep Matthew Monforton (R - Bozeman) says he's not running for a second term.Monforton championed...", "title": "Monforton won't run for second term in Montana House of Representatives"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KXLH.images.worldnow.com/images/8984852_G.jpg", "description": "One of the Montana Legislature's most vocal conservatives will step away from his seat.First-term MT Rep Matthew Monforton (R - Bozeman) says he's not running for a second term.Monforton championed...", "card": "summary", "title": "Monforton won't run for second term in Montana House of Representatives"}, "wnreadableurl": "monforton-wont-run-for-second-term-in-montana-house-of-representatives", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KXLH", "fb": {"app_id": 161591973908016}, "date": "2015/10/09", "KEYWORDS": "Great Falls, Montana, News, news, breaking news, weather, CBS", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS25", "news_keywords": "Great Falls, Montana, News, news, breaking news, weather, CBS"}, "article_summary": "Monforton is the second Montana House Republican this week to forgo re-election.\nAsked for examples of such wayward Republicans, Monforton named U.S. Rep.
