Esh hopes to open in the spring of 2016. (Trevor L. Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\nReuben Esh says spending $2.5 million on a new Loveland building for his discount grocery store won't hurt his ability to offer rock-bottom prices.\n\nAfter almost 14 years in business in a cramped store just west of Loveland, Esh's Discount Groceries will move next spring into a 33,000-square-foot building with retail, warehouse and office space.\n\nSite-preparation work started in August or September, Esh said, and the walls of the steel building at 375 W. 71st St. started going up a couple of weeks ago. Depending on the weather, he estimated that he could open in May.\n\nCustomers drawn by grocery prices at least 50 percent lower than retail learned to love the quirks of the store at 4221 W. Eisenhower Blvd., maneuvering for limited parking spaces, rubbing elbows with neighbors in narrow aisles and waiting in long checkout lines.\n\n\"My goal is to have the No. 1 customer service in Loveland ... and we feel limited right now with what we have over there,\" Esh said. \"It's so crowded, and there has been some frustration with the long lines and parking.\"\n\nEsh, who also has discount markets in Dacono and Evans, said he eventually wants to consolidate all his stores into the new Loveland location. Lease rates are high and interest rates are low, he said, so owning his building could save him money.\n\n\"We're looking forward to continuing our low prices and maybe even cutting them more,\" he said.\n\nBut even after he opens the new store in north Loveland, he said he might keep the west-Loveland location open to see how sales go there. His father, John Esh, owns the building.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new building will have almost 15,000 square feet each of warehouse and retail space, enabling Esh to triple his sales space and possibly move out of a leased warehouse in east Loveland.\n\nFeatures of the new store will include:\n\n\u2022 A larger deli section, with sandwiches for sale.\n\n\u2022 More cooler and freezer space.\n\n\u2022 Six or more cash registers, as opposed to three now.\n\n\u2022 115 parking spaces, rather than 40 now.\n\n\u2022 Three loading docks.\n\nWard Construction employee Kenny Tollefson removes snow so he can backfill a wall at the future site of Esh's Discount Groceries on Wednesday. (Trevor L. Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald)\n\n\u2022 Five to seven offices on-site. Esh said the store now has an office that doubles as a break room, and he also has offices at the warehouse and at his home.\n\n\u2022 Longer hours, possibly 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday.\n\nEsh's Discount Groceries keeps its prices down by selling food that is nearing its expiration date, products that didn't sell at other stores and items that might have been in a carton or crate that was damaged.\n\n\"Some of our products will even be outdated, but we sort through everything and make sure it's healthy to eat,\" said Esh, who added that it's legal to sell food past its expiration date \u2014 except baby food.\n\nEsh said some of his loyal customers travel great distances \u2014 from Cheyenne, Granby and Steamboat Springs, as well as Fort Collins and Windsor.\n\n\"The reason I chose this location (at Loveland's northern border) is because we're between Fort Collins and Loveland,\" he said. \"I think this will really draw the Fort Collins crowd.\"\n\nThe current store's location outside Loveland city limits means that customers aren't paying the city sales tax. Figuring the city would want to help Esh build in town so it could capture that revenue, he requested a deferment of $200,000 in city fees, to be paid back through the collection of sales taxes over 18 months.\n\nIn the midst of the controversy over a similar arrangement granting the Sprouts developers a $2.2 million incentive, the City Council said no. Instead, Esh's was given up to $200,000 in fee deferments that he has to pay back himself over five years, plus a waiver of up to $50,000 in building material use taxes.\n\n\"I am thankful for what the city did,\" Esh said, emphasizing that he has no hard feelings.\n\n\"I'm just happy to be here,\" he said. \"We're excited about the location, big time.\"\n\nCraig Young: 970-635-3634, cyoung@reporter-herald.com, www.twitter.com/CraigYoungRH.", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2016-01-02T21:28:25-0700", "modificationDate": "2016-01-02T21:29:09-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2016/0102/20160102__03RHBESH~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Craig Young \n \n  Reporter-Herald Staff Writer", "description": "Reuben Esh says spending $2.5 million on a new Loveland building for his discount grocery store won't hurt his ability to offer rock-bottom prices.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:29336519:view"}, "og": {"image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2016/0102/20160102__03RHBESH~2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Reuben Esh says spending $2.5 million on a new Loveland building for his discount grocery store won't hurt his ability to offer rock-bottom prices.", "title": "New Esh's in the works"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "Reuben Esh says spending $2.5 million on a new Loveland building for his discount grocery store won't hurt his ability to offer rock-bottom prices.", "title": "New Esh's in the works", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2016/0102/20160102__03RHBESH~2.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-01-02T21:28:25-0700", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "endDate": "2026-01-02T17:12:57-0700", "sailthru.title": "New Esh's in the works", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Craig YoungReporter-Herald", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2016/0102/20160102__03RHBESH~2.jpg", "pubDate": "2016-01-02T21:30:19-0700", "news_keywords": "Loveland news, Colorado news, world news, national news, local news, business news, sports news, entertainment news, us news, Loveland Reporter - Herald"}, "article_summary": "( Courtesy of Hauser Architects / Loveland Reporter-Herald )Reuben Esh, owner of Esh's Discount Groceries, poses Wednesday for a portrait at the store's new location at 375 W. 71st St. in north Loveland.\n(Trevor L.
