Of darkness.\n\nNow is the time for thoughtful people to look back over the last few months and ask themselves: What happened? Who can we blame for it? What punishment could possibly be horrible enough for them? And how would they look covered in lime?\n\nOf course, I don\u2019t want to seem to look down on or disrespect the berserk simian nincompoops who voted for Donald Trump. I don\u2019t want to seem like one of those elite establishment types who get all mired in concepts like reality or constitutional governance or honesty or decency or civilized behavior. Or decency. Or any of the other brie cheese and chardonnay hoity-toity ideas that lift us above the level of reptiles.\n\nBecause Donald Trump is going to make America great again, if by America you mean DreamLand and by great you mean a crapfest. And if you don't want to be left standing out in the cold with nothing to keep you company but your principles and your humanity (and maybe a nice glass of chardonnay), it's time to come to terms with Trump's nomination and decide on a response.\n\nHere are a few options along with their pros and cons:\n\nOption One - you could vote for Hillary Clinton, plunging America into a nightmare of political hackery and misguided leftist policy that will ravage our economy and send the world spiraling into chaos. Pro: It would give us a sense of seamless continuity with the last seven years. Con: The apocalypse, and her screechy voice.\n\nOption Two - you could refuse to vote and let Hillary get elected by default. Pro: You could sleep at night, knowing you weren\u2019t to blame for the destruction of the country. Con: You'd probably have to wake up sometime.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "What Do We Do Now? | Klavan On The Culture", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "Klavan On The Culture", "description": "A Trump v Clinton election leaves us with only a few options.", "title": "What's a Conservative to Do?", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/andrewklavan/2016/05/06/what-do-we-do-now/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/andrewklavan/user-content/49/files/2016/04/AP_141317081944.sized-770x415xt.jpg", "updated_time": 1464360921, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Trump v Clinton election leaves us with only a few options.", "title": "What's a Conservative to Do?", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/andrewklavan/2016/05/06/what-do-we-do-now/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/andrewklavan/user-content/49/files/2016/04/AP_141317081944.sized-770x415xt.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "What Do We Do Now? | Klavan On The Culture", "pinterestDescription": "What's a Conservative to Do?", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "keywords": "Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, voting, political satire", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Because Donald Trump is going to make America great again, if by America you mean DreamLand and by great you mean a crapfest.\nNow is the time for thoughtful people to look back over the last few months and ask themselves: What happened?\nOf course, I don\u2019t want to seem to look down on or disrespect the berserk simian nincompoops who voted for Donald Trump.\nPro: You could sleep at night, knowing you weren\u2019t to blame for the destruction of the country.\nOr any of the other brie cheese and chardonnay hoity-toity ideas that lift us above the level of reptiles."}
