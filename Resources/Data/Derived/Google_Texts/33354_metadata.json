In the footage, he was wearing a Colts uniform, throwing touchdown passes to Marvin Harrison, Reggie Wayne and Brandon Stokley.\n\nManning was wearing a white Broncos uniform as the emotional tribute played. He was a Colts quarterback for 14 seasons, a Broncos quarterback going on season No. 2.\n\nThe video was played a couple minutes before the game\u2019s opening kickoff, and Manning warmed up his right arm as usual. Between throws, though, he looked up at one of the screens.\n\nHe didn\u2019t want to disrespect the Indianapolis fans by ignoring his tribute.\n\nNear the end of the video, which was about a minute long, the highlights showed Manning standing on the midfield podium in a driving Miami rain after winning Super Bowl XLI on Feb. 4, 2007. He hoisted the Vince Lombardi Trophy as the rain poured.\n\nColts fans roared their approval Sunday night. The tribute ended with the screen fading to Colts blue and this message: \u201cThank You, Peyton.\u201d\n\nIt held there a few seconds as the sellout crowd cheered. Manning took off his helmet with his right hand and waved to the crowd with his left hand. He looked into the crowd and said, \u201cThank you, thank you very much,\u201d several times while nodding to his former hometown fans.\n\nAfter taking 15 to 20 seconds to acknowledge the cheers, Manning put on his helmet and moved toward his sideline. The visiting sideline. Denver\u2019s sideline. It was time for the game to kick off.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Indianapolis tribute to Peyton Manning includes short video, big cheers", "title": "Indianapolis tribute to Peyton Manning includes short video, big cheers", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/10/20/indianapolis-tribute-to-peyton-manning-includes-short-video-big-cheers/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131020__peyton-manning-tribute-102013p1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131020__peyton-manning-tribute-102013p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-20T19:44:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T15:23:15+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee6e\"", "article_summary": "A video tribute of Manning\u2019s career in Indianapolis played on the Lucas Oil Stadium jumbo screens Sunday night.\nManning was wearing a white Broncos uniform as the emotional tribute played.\nThe video was played a couple minutes before the game\u2019s opening kickoff, and Manning warmed up his right arm as usual.\nAfter taking 15 to 20 seconds to acknowledge the cheers, Manning put on his helmet and moved toward his sideline.\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 Robotic about his pregame routine, Peyton Manning took off his helmet and let the large crowd see that he is a human being first, a quarterback second."}
