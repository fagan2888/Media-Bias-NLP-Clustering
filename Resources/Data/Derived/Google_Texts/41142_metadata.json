The insurer asked providers to accept reimbursement rates as much as 30 percent lower than what Blue Shield previously paid through plans sold on the individual market.\n\nSome providers got on board, but not all. According to the company, just 60 percent of the doctors and 75 of the hospitals that participate in the Blue Shield of California\u2019s group plans will be included in individual plans purchased through Covered California, the state\u2019s new insurance exchange. And among the providers who declined to accept the lower rates were some of the state\u2019s most prestigious \u2014 and expensive \u2014 hospitals, including Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and hospitals affiliated with the University of California.\n\nAs millions of new ACA health plans begin 2014 coverage on Wednesday, consumers in some parts of the country, including California, will find that the plans offered under Obamacare give them access to fewer providers than their previous plans or those offered to Americans with job-based health insurance. Narrowing networks \u2014 promising select providers higher patient volume in exchange for lower reimbursement rates \u2014 is nothing new, but as insurers compete on price in Obamacare\u2019s new exchanges, avoiding expensive hospitals and doctors has new appeal, especially since insurers can no longer exclude sick people or charge them more. \u201cOur goal was to provide affordable options for California consumers and there are few levers we have to get to an affordable price point,\u201d says Steve Shivinsky, a spokesman for Blue Shield of California. \u201cOne of them is to ask the providers to contract with us at new rates and that led to smaller networks.\u201d\n\nA recent study suggests limited provider networks could become more common in the years ahead as the ACA takes hold. A Dec. 13 McKinsey study of 20 U.S. metropolitan areas found that two-thirds of ACA plans analyzed had \u201cnarrow\u201d or \u201cultra narrow\u201d networks, with at least 30 percent of top 20 hospitals excluded for coverage. The medium premium for plans with narrower networks, according to the study, was 26 percent lower than comparable benefit packages with broad networks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned with the impact that has on patients,\u201d says Cedars-Sinai CEO Thomas Priselac, arguing that consumers shopping through California\u2019s exchange will not have access to the world-renowned health care the hospital offers. Priselac says some insurers designing networks purely based on cost have replaced academic research institutions like Cedars-Sinai with lower-priced community hospitals that, in some cases, do not offer the same menu of services. Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital, the top pediatric facility in northwest Washington state, and one of the most expensive, sued the state insurance commissioner in October after hospital was excluded from the networks of some insurers selling plans there under the ACA.\n\nBut while some might say insurers are sacrificing patient choice and quality in service of the bottom line, there\u2019s another way to look at the narrow networks being offered through Obamacare. \u201cEveryone needs to commit to thinking about ways to reduce the unsustainable year over year increases in the cost of health care,\u201d says Shivinky of Blue Shield. Doctors and hospitals are now under new pressure to lower prices to get access to the flood of new customers shopping for insurance through the law\u2019s exchanges.\n\n\u201cThis is market competition,\u201d says Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation who studies the insurance market. \u201cWhether you like it or not, this is what we signed up for.\u201d\n\nPollitz, who worked for the Department of Health and Human Services helping to implement the ACA before taking a post at Kaiser, says it\u2019s not clear if hospitals like Cedars-Sinai will lower prices to attract customers through Obamacare\u2019s insurance exchanges. Consumers who buy insurance independently \u2014 the population the exchanges are built for \u2014 are a relatively small piece of the overall insurance market, meaning some providers may be able to ignore them without suffering financially. Priselac, of Cedars-Sinai, says it too soon to know if the hospital\u2019s exclusion from most ACA plans in California will hurt the hospital\u2019s bottom line. But, Pollitz says, \u201din a city like L.A. that has a gazillion hospitals, it\u2019s easier to kick a big one out.\u201d\n\nIn other areas, the effects of narrow networks may be more acute. In Maine and New Hampshire, Anthem, a dominant provider of individual market insurance policies, excluded a number of large hospitals in those states from its ACA plan network. For some residents in rural areas, according to Pollitz, this means they may have to drive long distances to get to in-network hospitals. \u201cIf you\u2019re in central Maine, you have to go to Portland to find a hospital and some people were kind of upset about that,\u201d she says. Texas Oncology, the largest cancer care practice in the state, said it has decided not to participate in the networks of any insurers selling 2014 policies through the Texas ACA exchange. Elsewhere, stories of major health care providers choosing to sit out next year\u2019s ACA plans \u2014 or being excluded by insurers \u2014 are piling up.\n\nIn a report released Dec. 11, Covered California said more than 80 percent of doctors in the state are included in the network of at least one insurer selling plans through the exchange. Still, Dr. Jeff Rideout, the exchange\u2019s senior medical adviser, concedes that many individual plans have networks that include fewer providers than non-ACA plans offered by the same insurers. But, he says, there is more upside than just lower prices. \u201cBetter value occurs when there\u2019s better alignment between a plan and a relatively tight network,\u201d says Rideout. In other words, when insurers and providers are more dependent on each other, there\u2019s more motivation to deliver efficient care. Integrated health systems that provide both insurance and care have, in many cases, some of the country\u2019s best health outcomes at the lowest cost. Very narrow networks may have a similar effect.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s potentially a great thing, but the devil is in the details,\u201d says Rideout.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Blue Shield of California was designing the new health plans it would offer individuals under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the insurer made a simple request to doctors and hospital in its network \u2014 lower your prices or get left behind.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The reform law is narrowing care networks", "title": "Keeping Your Doctor Under Obamacare Is No Easy Feat | TIME.com", "url": "http://swampland.time.com/2014/01/01/keeping-your-doctor-under-obamacare-is-no-easy-feat/", "image": "https://timeswampland.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/459127229.jpg?w=753", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Political insight from the Beltway and beyond", "fb": {"admins": "1124331582,512158401,808970553,100000018008769", "app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://swampland.time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/11d9978cfec7d5a71822113fdc067df5?s=16", "application-name": "Swampland", "keywords": "health care, obamacare", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "health care, obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfb5f\"", "article_summary": "Elsewhere, stories of major health care providers choosing to sit out next year\u2019s ACA plans \u2014 or being excluded by insurers \u2014 are piling up.\n\u201cEveryone needs to commit to thinking about ways to reduce the unsustainable year over year increases in the cost of health care,\u201d says Shivinky of Blue Shield.\nPriselac, of Cedars-Sinai, says it too soon to know if the hospital\u2019s exclusion from most ACA plans in California will hurt the hospital\u2019s bottom line.\nIn other words, when insurers and providers are more dependent on each other, there\u2019s more motivation to deliver efficient care.\n\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned with the impact that has on patients,\u201d says Cedars-Sinai CEO Thomas Priselac, arguing that consumers shopping through California\u2019s exchange will not have access to the world-renowned health care the hospital offers."}
