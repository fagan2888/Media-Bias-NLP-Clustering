But, as the company responsible for the error-riddled Obamacare website knows well, a good start can be interrupted, and there is uncertainty ahead that could keep the global information technology company from achieving its goal.\n\nThe Montreal-based company reported earnings Wednesday of 63 cents per share in the first quarter of 2016, topping the average 59 cent per share estimate of analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.\n\nTheir organic revenue growth for the quarter was -1.8 per cent, up from -3 per cent in the Q4 of 2015.\n\n\u201cOne of my sales pitches when I shake hands with a customer is that we\u2019ll still be around in 10 years to deliver on the promises we\u2019re making today,\u201d said CEO Michael Roach of the $16.7-billion company that boasts 68,000 employees across 40 countries.\n\n\u201cNot a lot of competitors can say that with the same conviction that we do.\u201d\n\nCGI has operations in Canada, the U.S., Europe and Asia, working on both private and government projects. In Q1 2016, 58 per cent of bookings were new business, with the remaining 42 per cent came from extensions and renewals.\n\nThe company reported Q1 revenues of $2.7 billion, representing growth of 5.6 per cent. Because of the company\u2019s strong U.S. exposure, foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact of $187.1 million.\n\nRelated\n\nMoving forward, Roach said a major company target is to work with financial institutions that are moving to increase digitization.\n\n\u201cA lot of our clients are feeling the pressure of the cost of operating and running their existing infrastructure, so they need to find funds to invest in the digital world,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo one ever won a war by giving up their home fort, so we protect our base.\u201d\n\nMaher Yaghi, an analyst at Desjardins Capital Markets, says Scotiabank\u2019s announcement last October that it would enhance digitizing its customer service operations makes him confident that CGI can grow its order book in the near future.\n\n\u201cWe believe other Canadian financial institutions will have to follow this strategy as clients\u2019 expectations of digital services will continue to rise,\u201d he said in note, rating the company as a \u201cbuy\u201d with an above-average level of risk.\n\nBut some analysts do see factors that could derail the company\u2019s outlook for organic growth in the coming year.\n\nBarclays warns that weakness in the Canadian energy sector spreading to other sectors could put CGI\u2019s investment in other businesses \u2014 banks in particular \u2014 at risk. There could also be tougher times ahead in the U.S. market as the country\u2019s economic outlook weakens in spite of a strong present environment.\n\n\u201cWhile ongoing macro volatility has reduced visibility and made returning to organic revenue growth a \u2018show me\u2019 story, we are encouraged by the stronger outlook for IT services spending in 2016 and 2017,\u201d said a report by Barclays Equity Research, recommending CGI in its \u201cBest Buys Amid a Shaky Market.\u201d\n\nCGI Group has being buying back shares over the past two quarters, which Roach says the company believes are undervalued. Shares were up 6.09 per cent to $58.89 in Toronto at 10:45 a.m. EST Wednesday.\n\nCGI owes much of its growth to transformational acquisitions, such as CGI Federal\u2019s 2010 acquisition of Stanley Inc. for US$1.07 billion, which almost doubled the company\u2019s presence in the U.S.\n\nIn October 2013, CGI Federal was blamed for millions of users not being able to access the website for the U.S. Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. In 2014 the federal government replaced CGI with a competitor, Accenture, though that company also ran into problems implementing the website.\n\nAt the moment, Roach says the company has 85 new acquisition targets and has identified an additional other 5,000 companies as possible targets.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though the company is bullish on growth, there is uncertainty ahead that could keep the global information technology company from achieving its goal", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Financial Post", "description": "Though the company is bullish on growth, there is uncertainty ahead that could keep the global information technology company from achieving its goal", "title": "Strong first quarter puts CGI Group Inc on track to return to organic revenue growth", "url": "http://business.financialpost.com/investing/market-moves/strong-first-quarter-puts-cgi-group-inc-on-track-to-return-to-organic-revenue-growth", "image": "http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/01/0127cgii.jpg?quality=60&strip=all", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://business.financialpost.com", "description": "Though the company is bullish on growth, there is uncertainty ahead that could keep the global information technology company from achieving its goal", "title": "Strong first quarter puts CGI Group Inc on track to return to organic revenue growth", "image": {"src": "http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2016/01/0127cgii.jpg?quality=60&strip=all"}, "site": "@financialpost", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Just another WordPress.com site", "fb": {"admins": 576295511, "app_id": 138801856165024}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "Financial Post", "keywords": "market moves, fp tech desk, cgi group inc.", "google-site-verification": "UhYuz5WLj9O99xHz05IP4O2gExeR_rozYMFxe-OeqTg", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://business.financialpost.com/feed;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b4ece3189893389a03f063830eacd95c?s=16"}, "article_summary": "But some analysts do see factors that could derail the company\u2019s outlook for organic growth in the coming year.\nMONTREAL \u2014 CGI Group Inc. is on its way to returning to organic growth after beginning the year with revenues that exceeded analyst expectations.\nTheir organic revenue growth for the quarter was -1.8 per cent, up from -3 per cent in the Q4 of 2015.\nIn 2014 the federal government replaced CGI with a competitor, Accenture, though that company also ran into problems implementing the website.\nIn October 2013, CGI Federal was blamed for millions of users not being able to access the website for the U.S."}
