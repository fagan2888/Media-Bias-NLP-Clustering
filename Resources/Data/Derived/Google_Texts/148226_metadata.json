Although nothing has been confirmed by Bravo, Schroeder appears to be on board with the idea.\n\n\u201cI love Bravo and I love filming,\u201d Schroeder revealed to the Wrap\u2018s Joseph Kapsch of a possible Vanderpump Rules spinoff. \u201cSo if it was something like [focusing on fashion], that would be great. I\u2019m not really about the cheating scandals and relationship drama anymore.\u201d\n\nAs fans will recall, Vanderpump Rules was spun off of the long-running Bravo series The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, which stars the boss of SUR Lounge, Lisa Vanderpump.\n\nSchroeder, who, as the Inquisitr reported, recently launched a jewelry line, also addressed Vanderpump Rules spinoff rumors in a separate interview.\n\n\u201cI think that would be so much fun!\u201d Schroeder told Fashion & Style earlier this year. \u201cAnything having to do with fashion or being creative would be great. I\u2019m getting a little tired of pouring my heart out and letting people see every facet of my life.\u201d\n\nFollowing Season 2 of Vanderpump Rules, Schroeder was admittedly undecided on a Season 3 return. \u201cAfter last season I just felt like a little bit disjoined,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou think people are one way and you trust them and then realize they aren\u2019t and it\u2019s just kind of exhausting. I didn\u2019t really think that I had left to give but then my boyfriend [Patrick Meagher] got a job here so I was back. And it was like well the stars are kind of aligned so I\u2019m here and may as well give what I have left.\u201d\n\nExpecting backlash when she did decide to return for Season 3 after seemingly dissing the show and the majority of it\u2019s stars, Schroeder, who, according to an Inquisitr report, was rumored to be pregnant earlier this year, was excited to see her fans had not turned against her.\n\n\u201cI am amazed and so appreciative! Because my fans could have easily been people that thought I was an a**hole. I\u2019m really lucky that they can see it is all in good fun. I try my best to do the right thing and I don\u2019t try to hurt people unless they have hurt me and that\u2019s when the claws come out and I feel that people have related to that and that\u2019s fantastic. I try to be creative!\u201d\n\nAlso in the interview with Fashion & Style, the possible Vanderpump Rules spinoff star confirmed her boyfriend would not be seen on Vanderpump Rules Season 3.\n\n[Photo via Twitter]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is a 'Vanderpump Rules' spinoff on its way?", "og": {"site_name": "The Inquisitr News", "description": "Is a \u2018Vanderpump Rules\u2019 spinoff on its way?", "title": "\u2018Vanderpump Rules\u2019 Spinoff Coming Soon?
