Are the Kardashians overexposed?\n\nI\u2019ve been watching a marathon of \"The Simpsons\" on FXX, so it\u2019s understandable that my first reaction to a new GOP study on female voters was \u201cd\u2019oh!\u201d The headline in Politico said it all: \u201c GOP poll of women: Party 'stuck in past'.\u201d If I had written the headline, it would have been \u201cGOP collateral damage in its own war on women.\u201d\n\nWomen who talked to Republican researchers had many unkind things to say about the Grand Old Party, including that it was \u201clacking in compassion.\" The report stated that women are \u201cbarely receptive to Republican policies.\u201d The study also contained this nugget: \u201cRepublicans fail to speak to women in the different circumstances in their lives.\u201d\n\nIn other words, why does the GOP prevent women from making decent money to support their families? Or why are Republicans limiting access to birth control when women may not be ready for kids?\n\n[SEE: Cartoons about the Republican Party]\n\nThe GOP research also found that, among women, Democrats had a 39 percent advantage on affordable health care and tolerance of other lifestyles. Among women who care about jobs, the Democratic Party had a 35 percent advantage over the GOP. In the spirit of the U.S. Open tennis tournament, point, set and match for Democrats.\n\nDiscovering the GOP has a problem with women is like inspecting Willie Wonka\u2019s chocolate factory and finding candy on the premises. I could have told the party the same thing on election night in 2012 when I examined the exit polls from the presidential race. A majority of men (52 percent) voted for Mitt Romney, but an even larger majority of women (55 percent) supported President Barack Obama. Not only that, but more women voted in 2012 than men.\n\nLet me emphasize that Republicans, not Democrats, did the study Politico covered. Two GOP-aligned organizations, Crossroads GPS and the American Action Network, sponsored the survey.\n\nThe Republican National Committee did a post-election autopsy in January 2013 and found the same thing. But the GOP hasn\u2019t done anything since then to fix the problem. In fact, the party has gone out of its way to alienate female voters. For instance, an overwhelming number of the workers who make the minimum wage are women, but the House GOP never even voted on a Senate bill that would have raised the rate to $10.10 an hour. Women make only 77 percent of what men in the same jobs make, but the Senate GOP filibustered a Democratic proposal to make sure women were paid the same wages as men for the same jobs.\n\n[MORE: Cartoons about Congress]\n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough, the GOP geniuses could have looked at a national survey that CNN conducted earlier this year. A majority (55 percent) of Americans said the GOP doesn\u2019t understand the problems of women. Even larger majorities of women (59 percent) and women over the age of 50 (64 percent) felt the same way.\n\nSo should we be surprised that the GOP has trouble with women? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nIf these organizations had conducted studies on Latinos, African-Americans and Asians, their researchers would have found the same thing: that all kinds of voters have problems with the Grand Old Party. The only dependable groups of voters who have stuck with the GOP are old white guys. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m an old white guy, but I\u2019m a Democrat. Some of my best friends are old white guys, but there aren\u2019t enough of them left to win a presidential election.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "The GOP Has a Women Problem, Another Survey Shows", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The GOP still has a problem with women voters, which is no surprise when you look at its policies.", "title": "Reaping What the War on Women Sowed", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/brad-bannon/2014/09/02/the-gop-has-a-women-problem-another-survey-shows", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/81/08/701f45d745aca8901cddc65eafeb/thumb-6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "The GOP Has a Women Problem, Another Survey Shows", "description": "The GOP still has a problem with women voters, which is no surprise when you look at its policies.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Sept. 2, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Brad Bannon,female voters,Republican Party,politics,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The GOP still has a problem with women voters, which is no surprise when you look at its policies."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf39a\"", "article_summary": "Discovering the GOP has a problem with women is like inspecting Willie Wonka\u2019s chocolate factory and finding candy on the premises.\nSome of my best friends are old white guys, but there aren\u2019t enough of them left to win a presidential election.\nNot only that, but more women voted in 2012 than men.\nThe only dependable groups of voters who have stuck with the GOP are old white guys.\nEven larger majorities of women (59 percent) and women over the age of 50 (64 percent) felt the same way."}
