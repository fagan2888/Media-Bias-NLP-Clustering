Tennessee taxpayers this year are having to pay an additional $3.5 million for TennCare, the state's Medicaid program.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act certainly has helped increase enrollment by more than 20 percent. With marketplace health insurance rates unaffordable for low-income workers, more and more working poor are turning to Medicaid for health insurance. Much of this will come to light as lawmakers gather in Knoxville on Friday to search for ways to reduce costs so more people can have access to care.\n\nHowever, there is bold plan before the Tennessee Legislature that would bring $6.1 billion to the coffers of TennCare and the state employees' insurance plans over 10 years. It would save private employers $25 billion over the same time period. That savings would come from eliminating wasteful, defensive medicine under the proposed Insurance Costs Reduction Act.\n\nDefensive medicine happens in physicians' offices every day. It occurs when a doctor orders an X-ray, CT scan, MRI, blood work or other test, procedure or medication that is not clinically necessary but is ordered out of fear of a potential lawsuit.\n\nTo significantly reduce defensive medicine, Tennessee lawmakers have proposed a Patients' Compensation System, or PCS, which would abolish the state's current dysfunctional medical malpractice system and replace it with a no-blame, administrative model similar to workers' compensation.\n\nUnder the PCS proposal, patients who have been injured by a physician would no longer take their case to court. Instead, they would file a claim before an administrative panel of health care experts and an administrative law judge. If the panel finds a medical injury had occurred, the patient would be quickly compensated \u2014 unlike our current legal system, which takes years and compensates very few injured patients.\n\nPatients would be compensated in an amount similar to what they would receive after years in the legal system. This no-blame, administrative model would eliminate the adversarial relationship between patient and doctor, and allow physicians to acknowledge their errors without fear of litigation.\n\nA new survey released this spring by Beacon Research finds that 85 percent of Tennessee doctors believe a proposed PCS would reduce health care costs. Another 89 percent said they would support the proposal before the Tennessee General Assembly. And 64 percent said they would eliminate or significantly reduce the practice of defensive medicine, thus reducing health care costs.\n\nBioScience Valuation, a health care economics firm, reports defensive medicine cost $487 billion in the United States in 2015. In Tennessee, defensive medicine runs about $13 billion annually.\n\nTennessee is not alone in this bold approach. Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Maine and Montana are considering similar plans before their state legislatures.\n\nWashington, D.C., has failed the states when it comes to health care reform. Healing will only come with homegrown solutions, and a Tennessee PCS that eliminates so much wasteful medicine may be the model we can set for the rest of the nation.\n\nCharles R.
