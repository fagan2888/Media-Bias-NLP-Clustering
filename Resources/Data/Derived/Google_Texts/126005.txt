An 18-year-old woman is behind bars for allegedly stealing from her grandmother.

Kalei Rose Manibusan was arraigned by Justice of the Peace Bill Cooke on Friday on a charge of debit card abuse.

According to an arrest affidavit, a woman told Killeen police someone withdrew $1,200 — in $200 increments — from her First National Bank account Feb. 4 without her permission.

Police were able to pull images of the suspect making the transactions, and the victim identified the individual as Manibusan. The affidavit identified Manibusan as the woman’s granddaughter.

Cooke set Manibusan’s bond at $20,000.
