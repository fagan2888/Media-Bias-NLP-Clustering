Disney CEO Bob Iger discusses the historic success his company experienced as Disney reports their best earnings to date.

Walt Disney reported quarterly earnings and revenue Tuesday that handily topped analysts' expectations, as sales in its film unit surged on the strength of "Star Wars: The Force Awakens."



The media giant posted fiscal first-quarter earnings of $1.63 per share, adjusted, on $15.24 billion in revenue. Earnings per share rose 28 percent from the previous year, while sales climbed 14 percent.

Analysts had expected Disney to report earnings of about $1.45 a share on $14.75 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters.



"Well, we had great performance across the board, really. Clearly, 'Star Wars' drove the studio performance," CEO Bob Iger told CNBC's "Closing Bell" on Tuesday.



But the company's cable networks — a recent point of concern for investors — saw a year-over-year decrease in operating income.

Disney shares fell as much as 6 percent in after-hours trading, before regaining some ground to a drop of 4 percent.
