In return, the Rockies acquired three highly regarded pitching prospects: Jeff Hoffman, Miguel Castro and Jesus Tinoco. Colorado also took on shortstop Jose Reyes and his annual $22 million salary.\n\nThe Rockies are intrigued and hopeful about Castro and Tinoco, but make no mistake about it, Hoffman was the centerpiece of the Tulo trade.\n\nWATCH: Who could end up in the Rockies starting pitching rotation?\n\nHoffman, a nonroster invitee, walked into the Rockies\u2019 spring training clubhouse at Salt River Fields last week. He was wearing a golf shirt from East Carolina University, his alma mater. He is 23 but could pass for a college freshman \u2014 if that freshman was 6-foot-4 and could throw an upper-90s fastball.\n\nA hovering question is whether Hoffman is ready to carry the weight of the trade on his broad shoulders, but he seemed unruffled by the query.\n\nWATCH: How did Colorado Rockies\u2019 players spend their offseasons?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think (there is) any added pressure,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cThey made the trade for who I am, and I don\u2019t think I need to be anything extra.\u201d\n\nGeneral manager Jeff Bridich, who engineered the trade, clearly feels the same way. During last month\u2019s Rockies Fest at Coors Field, a reporter asked Bridich if the Rockies would handle Hoffman with extra care, given that he was the cornerstone of such a major trade.\n\nBridich responded brusquely: \u201cNo. He\u2019s another player and another person just like everyone else. If you are hung up on giving him that moniker, then that\u2019s you. You were not involved in those negotiations, and you have no idea how much we value him as a player. So, that\u2019s your hang-up.\u201d\n\nThere is no timetable as to when Hoffman will make his Rockies debut, not after Tommy John surgery in May 2014 complicated his path. Hoffman was considered one of the top players in the 2014 draft and a possible first overall pick, thanks to his wicked fastball-curveball-changeup combo. But the surgery curtailed his junior season and he slipped to the ninth overall pick, where Toronto snared him.\n\nAccording to Bridich, the Blue Jays planned to promote Hoffman to the big leagues last season. The Rockies are taking a different, slower path.\n\n\u201cHe was being told by his former team that they were planning on having him be a September call-up last year,\u201d Bridich said. \u201cWe certainly put every foot that we had on that brake and changed lanes and changed avenues with a greater outlook toward future help, toward extended help.\u201d\n\nAfter spending 2014 recovering from surgery, Hoffman began pitching again last May. Pitching first at High-A and then at Double-A, he went 5-5 with a 3.03 ERA and a 1.17 WHIP.\n\nRockies Mailbag: Pose a question for Patrick Saunders\n\n\u201cObviously, I was just trying to stay healthy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was my first year after Tommy John, and every day I was out there just feeling myself and kind of trying to get back in the groove of things and trying to get back to my normal self.\u201d\n\nSince his operation, Hoffman has added a slider to his repertoire.\n\n\u201cIt gives me a different look,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks like a fastball coming out of my hand, and it\u2019s a smaller, more controllable breaking ball.\u201d\n\nHoffman said he doesn\u2019t know when he will make his big-league splash. If Bridich has an idea, he\u2019s not letting on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you exactly what our plan would be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe certainly feel really good about where Jeff is at in terms of recovery from the injury and being able to take the ball and do what he did last year.\n\n\u201cI think we have to sit down with Jeff in spring training and make sure that everybody is on the same page. But we all look forward to Jeff pitching for us and hopefully advancing his career at the highest levels here.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or @psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies\u2019 Jeff Hoffman undaunted to be centerpiece of Tulowitzki trade", "title": "Rockies\u2019 Jeff Hoffman undaunted to be centerpiece of Tulowitzki trade", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/21/rockies-jeff-hoffman-undaunted-to-be-centerpiece-of-tulowitzki-trade/", "image": {"width": 768, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160221_095605_jeff-hoffman.jpg", "height": 534}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160221_095605_jeff-hoffman.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-21T22:02:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T02:36:25+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc97c0\"", "article_summary": "In return, the Rockies acquired three highly regarded pitching prospects: Jeff Hoffman, Miguel Castro and Jesus Tinoco.\nBut we all look forward to Jeff pitching for us and hopefully advancing his career at the highest levels here.\u201dPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or @psaundersdp\nThe Rockies are intrigued and hopeful about Castro and Tinoco, but make no mistake about it, Hoffman was the centerpiece of the Tulo trade.\nWATCH: How did Colorado Rockies\u2019 players spend their offseasons?\n\u201cThey made the trade for who I am, and I don\u2019t think I need to be anything extra.\u201dGeneral manager Jeff Bridich, who engineered the trade, clearly feels the same way."}
