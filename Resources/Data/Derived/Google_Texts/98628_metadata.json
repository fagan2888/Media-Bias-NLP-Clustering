A fitting spot, for sure.\n\nWith eyes wide open and tongue hanging out, the quirky player who seems to be a perfect fit for a quirky ballpark rallied his team and their fans, sending the Giants past the Kansas City Royals 11-4 Saturday to even the Series at two games apiece.\n\n\u201cI mean, he\u2019s the guy that\u2019s a vocal leader on the team, and he gets guys fired up,\u201d rookie second baseman Joe Panik said.\n\n\u201cAnd with his play, he\u2019s all-out and gives everything he\u2019s got. It\u2019s spectacular to watch. He\u2019s fun to watch. He\u2019s really big to this team.
