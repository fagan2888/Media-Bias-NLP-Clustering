One person is dead after being struck by several vehicles on a highway Sunday morning in Topeka.

Dispatchers said the accident was reported around 6:15 a.m. on U.S. Highway 75 just north of Lower Silver Lake Road.

Police told WIBW that it is unknown why the pedestrian was walking along the highway and what caused him to be hit. The victim has been identified, but authorities are withholding his name pending notification of next of kin.

One driver called Topeka police, and all witnesses stayed on the scene.

Northbound US-75 at Lower Silver Lake Road is shut down for an unknown amount of time as crews continue to work the scene and reconstruct the accident.
