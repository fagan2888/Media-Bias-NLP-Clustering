On Tuesday, the militant group Islamic State on Iraq (ISIS) released a 52-second film, dubbed “Flames of War,” that was meant as a warning to President Barack Obama in regard to what awaits American troops entering Iraq. The following day, a response to ISIS’s anti-American propaganda video came from an unlikely source, The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. The satirical comic poked fun at their attempt to establish a “caliphate,” an Islamic state ruled by a religious or political leader, and even went as far as to claim the terrorist group was “jealous” over the attention given to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

On the same day ISIS released their crudely made threat, President Obama announced the deployment of 3,000 American troops to help “combat and contain” the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has currently claimed over 2,200 lives. Although President Obama has declared that "the American forces do not and will not have a combat mission," he has also said that American troops "will support Iraqi forces on the ground as they fight for their own country against these terrorists."

As Stewart puts it, “You tell me what sounds scary, a bunch of dips**ts in pickup trucks or something that will liquefy your internal organs if a lady sneezes on you wrong on your flight to Tampa.”
