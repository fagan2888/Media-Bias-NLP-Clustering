An Arkansas restaurant owner has learned the hard way that it's usually better to stick to promoting your menu than your politics, especially when you mix in a dash of racially charged messaging.

A sign in front of Smokin' Joe's Ribhouse in Rogers, Ark. read "ObamaCare America's punishment for slavery years."

The sign was up for only 45 minutes before owner Johnny Howard pulled it down due to the almost immediate response from locals.

Howard says he is sorry for posting the message and insists he never meant to make it "racist-orientated."

He told ABC 40/29 his criticism was aimed at the Affordable Care Act, and not President Barack Obama, "It's the policy and I made the mistake of wording it in the wrong fashion. The policy. It’s not the person it’s the policy."

Howard does argue that "Obamacare" will hurt his business. He replaced the health care message with a tamer, "Why cook? Get some carry out."
