Consumers will have access to easy-to-understand ACA information, infographics, videos and FAQs; as well as a proprietary tax calculator that analyzes the impact of the ACA on an individual's specific situation. All of these tools and resources are on one site -- http://hrblock.com/acataximpact. This website is dedicated to assisting consumers navigate the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) tax requirements.\n\nH&R Block's Taxes and ACA website was developed so that consumers can easily understand the immense amounts of information related to this tax event. The videos are short and the infographics are self-explanatory. There is a glossary, as well as a question-and-answer forum, plus, highly informative overviews making ACA-related tax changes easier for taxpayers to understand. The proprietary ACA Tax Impact Analysis calculator walks taxpayers through a series of simple questions, so they can find out exactly if and how they and their families are impacted by the ACA's tax code changes. The calculator provides personalized results and creates a printable summary with action steps to potentially minimize any tax penalties and secure qualifying health care coverage if necessary.\n\n\"The Affordable Care Act impacts millions of tax filers in some way,\" said Mark Ciaramitaro, vice president of health care at H&R Block. \"Taxpayers want to know what those changes mean for them personally and their unique situations.
