The mandate requires employer health care plans to contain preventive care coverage that includes FDA-approved contraceptive methods and sterilization procedures. The ACA originally exempted purely religious employers like houses of worship from its requirements, but otherwise applied the contraceptive regulations to religious employers like Notre Dame.\n\nThe uproar against the Obama Administration about that original rule was equally vigorous and ridiculous. The Catholic bishops and other religious employers like Notre Dame accused the Administration of conducting a war on religious freedom, even though there is no constitutional rule that excuses religious employers from compliance with the law. Amish employers, for example, have long been required to pay Social Security taxes, and fundamentalist Christian employers to pay men and women equally. As the Catholic Church should have learned from its child abuse crisis, moreover, bishop employers are expected to obey the criminal laws and civil reporting statutes even when their rules against public scandal tell them not to. Notre Dame should have obeyed the original law and provided coverage to its 5000 full and part-time employees and 11,500 graduate and undergraduate students, who include Catholics who obey or disobey their church\u2019s teaching, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Agnostics, Atheists and others whose use of contraceptives is their own constitutionally-protected business.\n\nUnfortunately, it is virtually impossible for politicians to confront the political clout of organized religions, and the Obama Administration caved in to its religious critics like Notre Dame. Back in 1993, similar political pressure led Congress and President Clinton to produce the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which prohibits the federal government from \u201csubstantially burden[ing] a person\u2019s exercise of religion,\u201d and currently wreaks havoc on the rights of women, gays and lesbians. In the spirit of accommodation, Obama naively offered a compromise that he thought would answer the religious employers\u2019 objections by requiring someone else to provide the insurance coverage. Under the new rule, all Notre Dame had to do was inform the administrators of its insurance coverage that it objected to the contraceptive mandate, and the administrator would provide the contraceptive coverage that the university opposed. In Notre Dame\u2019s case, this required two actions. By December 31, 2013, it would have to inform Meritain, the third-party administrator (TPA) of its employee insurance plan, and by August 31, 2014, Aetna, the company that insures its student body, that it \u201copposes providing coverage for some or all of any contraceptive services that would otherwise be required to be covered; the organization is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity; and the organization holds itself out as a religious organization.\u201d Then Notre Dame\u2019s role would end, and the companies\u2019 obligations would begin. Meritain\u2019s and Aetna\u2019s expenses were reimbursable by the federal government,\n\nAfter the new regulations were issued in July 2013, Notre Dame complied with them. It informed Meritain of its objections. Soon thereafter, Meritain undertook its job of notifying Notre Dame employees of the availability of contraceptive coverage. Then, surprisingly, \u201cat the last minute\u201d and \u201ccreat[ing] its own emergency\u201d (as criticized by two federal judges), Notre Dame rushed to court to voice its objections to the new compromise and its view that the regulations violated RFRA, as well as constitutional guarantees of free exercise, free speech and the constitutional prohibition on the establishment of religion.\n\nNotre Dame\u2019s argument strangely focuses on scandal, which in Catholic theology, the complaint explains, is defined as \u201cleading by words or example others to engage in wrongdoing.\u201d \u201cScandal is an attitude or behavior which leads another to do evil. The person who gives scandal becomes his neighbor\u2019s tempter.\u201d One must read the complaint carefully to understand how Notre Dame tempts her neighbors to engage in contraceptive use. Whenever Notre Dame signs the form objecting to contraception, the complaint alleges, it \u201ctriggers the provision of \u2018free\u2019 objectionable coverage to Notre Dame\u2019s employees in a manner contrary to its beliefs.\u201d Notre Dame argues that by signing the objection, it \u201cfacilitates\u201d contraception, and (incredibly) by doing so \u201cwill lead many to think Notre Dame condones these services, and hence undermines the role of Notre Dame, a Catholic educational institution, to educate others on a matter of religious and moral significance.\u201d\n\nAs the italicized words confirm, Notre Dame\u2019s insistence that it objects to the \u201ctrigger\u201d and not to contraception itself is risible. Its core argument is the non sequitur that by signing a form that says it opposes contraception, it actually condones it. Moreover, federal district court Judge Philip Simon found that, pre-mandate, \u201c[a]s Notre Dame admitted at the hearing, Notre Dame had already instructed its TPA in past years to not include contraception in its plan. So Notre Dame isn\u2019t modifying its behavior in the least. The only thing that is modified, then, under the accommodation, is that when Notre Dame tells the TPA not to provide contraception on Notre Dame\u2019s plan the government and the TPA pay for contraception.\u201d Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Richard Posner further demolished Notre Dame\u2019s \u201ctrigger\u201d argument when he explained that federal law requires Meritain and Aetna to provide insurance coverage to Notre Dame students and employees. Federal law, not a Notre Dame signature, triggers contraceptive coverage. Notre Dame\u2019s argument thus stretches factual causation beyond credible limits.\n\nNotre Dame rejects all these logical and legal arguments on the grounds that only it can determine what is immoral or moral, scandalous or pure, under Catholic theology. The university buttresses that claim with the problematic RFRA. Under RFRA, Notre Dame argues, Catholic theology defines a substantial burden on religion. Even if judges think signing the form is acceptable, Catholics believe it is not. Accordingly, the school concludes, the law must yield to Catholic theology, which forbids the public scandal of Notre Dame\u2019s signing a paper restating what it already tells its insurance brokers every year.\n\nThat argument must be rejected. We have heard it before. In the name of avoiding public scandal, Catholic cardinals from Boston to Los Angeles covered up the sexual abuse of children and hid priests from prosecution, all the while arguing in courts across the country that the First Amendment shielded them from compliance with the law. With this in mind, we need to remember that the law must govern the churches, not the other way around.\n\nJudge Posner shrewdly explained how novel and extreme in American history is Notre Dame\u2019s claim \u201cto have the right to have an exemption without claiming it.\u201d At oral argument, he posed the following hypothetical:\n\nSuppose it is wartime, there is a draft, and a Quaker is called up. Many Quakers are pacifists, and their pacifism is a tenet of their religion. Suppose the Quaker who\u2019s been called up tells the Selective Service system that he\u2019s a conscientious objector. The Selective Service officer to whom he makes this pitch accepts the sincerity of his refusal to bear arms and excuses him. But as the Quaker leaves the selective service office, he\u2019s told: \u201cyou know this means we\u2019ll have to draft someone in place of you\u201d\u2014and the Quaker replies indignantly that if the government does that, it will be violating his religious beliefs. Because his religion teaches that no one should bear arms, drafting another person in his place would make him responsible for the military activities of his replacement, and, by doing so, would substantially burden his own sincere religious beliefs. Would this mean that by exempting him the government had forced him to \u201ctrigger\u201d the drafting of a replacement who was not a conscientious objector, and that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act would require a draft exemption for both the Quaker and his non-Quaker replacement? That seems a fantastical suggestion. Yet confronted with this hypothetical at the oral argument, Notre Dame\u2019s counsel acknowledged its applicability, and said that drafting a replacement indeed would substantially burden the Quaker\u2019s religion.\n\nPosner\u2019s hypothetical illustrates the problem with broad claims like Notre Dame\u2019s that RFRA replaces the law with the plaintiff\u2019s individual morality. Unfortunately, not all judges have shown the insight of Judges Simon and Posner. Judge Flaum dissented in the Seventh Circuit case of Notre Dame, and other courts have awarded temporary victories to employers that are in the same situation as Notre Dame, ruling that any time a religious group claims a substantial burden it cannot be challenged.\n\nI was fortunate to be among the first women admitted to Notre Dame. Today, as then, I urge the university to listen to Notre Dame women. Three Notre Dame students, Jane Does 1, 2, and 3, have filed an excellent Intervenors\u2019 Brief urging that RFRA not be \u201ctransformed into a trump card to be played by the University at will\u201d to limit the rights of its women employees and students to make intimate personal choices.\n\nThat would be the real scandal.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://verdict.justia.com/2014/03/14/scandal-notre-dame", "image": "https://i2.wp.com/verdict.justia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_10781380.jpg?resize=426%2C350&quality=90&strip=all&fit=1000%25", "description": "I am disappointed to see my alma mater, the University of Notre Dame, leading the litigation charge against the contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
