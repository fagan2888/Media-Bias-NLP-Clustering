The hospital system had asked the court to immediately force Western Reserve Hospital Partners to be more transparent in how the for-profit hospital is run. Instead, both parties are moving toward a trial date scheduled for next year.\n\n\n\nWestern Reserve Hospital Partners voted last year to strip Summa of its 40% stake in Western Reserve Hospital, alleging the Akron-based hospital system violated the operating agreement by selling a minority stake of its enterprise to HealthSpan Partners, an auxiliary organization of Cincinnati-based Mercy Health. Summa last February went on to file its own lawsuit against the group of about 200 physicians, demanding reinstatement to the hospital\u2019s board of directors. It appeared both parties had settled their issues earlier this year, though earlier this month, Summa renewed the legal fight.\n\n\n\nIn short, Summa alleged that despite initial agreements, all of its requests have fallen on deaf ears, particularly on those of Dr. Robert Kent, Western Reserve Hospital\u2019s president and CEO. In a strongly worded letter to employees sent earlier this month, Summa chief operating officer Valerie Gibson said Summa renewed its lawsuit because Kent and the physician-investors\u2019 leadership team have refused to open up their books \u2014 something required as part of the hospital\u2019s joint operating agreement.\n\n\n\nSumma contends that, as a joint owner, it has the right to ensure the hospital complies with state and federal regulations, particularly as it relates to contracts the hospital entered into during the period Summa lacked representation on its board.\n\n\n\nMoreover, Summa has said it may have to evict the hospital from its current property because both parties can\u2019t agree on a selling price for the facility. That\u2019s not a desirable outcome \u2014 particularly as it relates to patients or Summa\u2019s own business interest in the joint venture \u2014 but one that might be necessary because of strict federal laws.\n\n\n\nIn a statement issued to Crain\u2019s on Wednesday, Bernstein said that at a hearing last week \u201cthe parties began to negotiate a resolution of issues, including a sale of the building and addressing partnership concerns. While the parties did not settle the dispute, Summa remains committed to offering a resolution that will ensure the hospital remains an important part of the community.\n\n\n\nA Western Reserve spokesman declined comment, citing the pending litigation. However, when news broke earlier this month that Summa had reignited the legal fight, Kent said in a fiery statement that Summa\u2019s actions were the acts of a \u201cbig bully trying to push the little guy around.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s only a matter of time before the Western Reserve-Summa partnership completely unwinds, though the Affordable Care Act has complicated matters.\n\n\n\nSumma officials say they need a good look at the hospital\u2019s books before they can sell off their stake in the venture. Because of provisions of the Affordable Care Act, Summa simply can\u2019t sell its stake to Western Reserve\u2019s physician-investors because of a moratorium on physician ownership. Summa would have to sell its stake to a non-physician-owned enterprise.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "The hospital system had asked the court to immediately force Western Reserve Hospital Partners to be more transparent in how the for-profit hospital is run.
