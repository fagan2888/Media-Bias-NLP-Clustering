For a special set to air on Tuesday, CNN’s Don Lemon and Alisyn Camerota sat down with five of the women who have accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault to discuss what exactly they would like to see happen as a result of the allegations. Despite the way Lemon’s last interview with Cosby accuser Joan Tarshis turned out, the CNN host and his colleague managed to gain some insight into how several of the nearly two dozen accusers feel decades after their alleged assaults.

As has already become clear from the accounts these women have offered, so many of their stories share chillingly similarities. At one point, Camerota asked the women if Cosby drugged them; all five raise their hands.

“That seems to have been, from the women we’ve spoken to, his M.O. — he would drug women,” Camerota said. “Who of you remembers being drugged?”
