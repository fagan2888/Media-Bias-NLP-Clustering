And the haste with which Common Core was adopted and implemented has caused problems, adding to a host of concerns already surrounding Common Core.\n\nIn an article last month in Education Week magazine, reporter Liana Heitin reported that some Common Core expert reviewers felt rushed in their review of the standards. Heitin interviewed Hung-Shi Wu, professor emeritus of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, and a member of the Common Core development team. Wu concluded: \u201cThe amount of time given to the high school standards was definitely inadequate.\u201d\n\nThis is consistent with Dr. James Milgram\u2019s ongoing critique of the standards since their development in 2009. Milgram, who serves as professor emeritus of mathematics at Stanford University, was one of five members of the 30-person Common Core validation committee who refused to sign on to the standards.\n\nA Pioneer Institute report coauthored by Milgram detailed that, by seventh grade, Common Core mathematics standards leave American students two grade levels behind their peers internationally and do not prepare them for admission into highly selective four-year universities and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) programs.\n\n\u201cIf you came to college with only an Algebra II background and you wanted to major in a STEM area, you have a 1/50 chance\u2014 a 2 percent chance\u2014 of ever obtaining a degree in STEM\u2026 This level of preparation is simply insufficient,\u201d said Milgram.\n\nAccording to Education Week, teachers also are struggling with how to teach to the Common Core math standards.\n\n\u201cEach standard has so many ideas built into it, you really have to sit down and think through all the implications of that,\u201d said math teacher Bobson Wong. \u201cI could easily make each of these courses a two-year course.\u201d\n\nAnd recently, reports surfaced that the Common Core architects left what some consider holes in the standards.\n\nRichard A. Askey, a professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and former member of the math standards\u2019 feedback group, later noticed an omission of a geometry standard in Common Core. In fact, according to Education Week, Askey said \u201cthe process toward the end was so hurried that an entire high school standard was left out of the final draft.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no formal mechanism in place for a wholesale review of the common core, but it\u2019s likely that states will\u2014as they always have\u2014review their standards at times and decide whether they need to be altered,\u201d the Education Week article said.\n\nWhen Common Core was created in 2009 by Achieve Inc., with oversight from the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers, its adoption immediately was tied to federal incentives through billions in competitive grants and waivers from provisions in the No Child Left Behind law.\n\nBy 2010, 46 states had signed on to the standards and agreed to implement them fully by this school year. Over the last two years, states have begun to realize the costs of quickly signing on to Common Core. By 2015, 15 of the original 46 states that agreed to Common Core have made efforts to withdraw from the standards and aligned tests. Four exited the standards completely\u2014Indiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Louisiana.\n\nThe haste of Common Core\u2019s adoption is felt across the nation\u2014but the extent is not yet realized. The alignment of college entrance exams, such as the SAT and ACT, and advanced placement courses cause concern over the \u201cvoluntary\u201d nature of the standards.\n\nYet, there is still hope. Many states are putting forth measures to reclaim autonomy over their standards and are beginning to practice competitive federalism, thoughtfully considering their state standards, Common Core and other state standards to make a set of standards and tests that are best for their students\u2019 college or career readiness.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Are students learning enough?", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Are students learning enough?", "title": "Concerns Grow about Common Core Standards", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/mathteacher.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-12T14:00:20+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1ExESr1"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Are students learning enough?", "title": "Concerns Grow about Common Core Standards", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/mathteacher.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "common core", "published_time": "2015-03-12T09:57:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-12T14:00:20+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Education Week, Common Core, Council of Chief State School Officers, National Governors Association, Achieve Inc., No Child Left Behind, Richard A.
