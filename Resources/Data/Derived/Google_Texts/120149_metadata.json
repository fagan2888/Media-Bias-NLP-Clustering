A cold-front is approaching from the west and is expected to trigger thunderstorm activity in the afternoon and evening.\n\nDamaging winds are possible where the strongest storms develop and localized flooding is possible statewide as torrential rains are expected to accompany any storms that develop.\n\nWhen the cold front passes over the state tonight, it will signal the end to a week marked by heat and humidity in New Jersey. Temperatures are expected to fall to much more seasonal levels to round out the weekend into the work week, with highs in the 70s and low 80s and lows in the upper 50s and low 60s.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "nj-weather, weather, news", "title": "Severe thunderstorms possible tonight; approaching cold front should break heat", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Damaging winds and flooding rains are possible.", "title": "Severe thunderstorms possible tonight; approaching cold front should break heat", "url": "http://www.nj.com/weather-guy/index.ssf/2014/09/severe_thunderstorms_possible_tonight_approaching_cold_front_should_break_heat.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/weather-guy/photo/accu-rainjpg-0fb861e216ceee74.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Damaging winds and flooding rains are possible.", "creator": "@sstirling", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/weather-guy/photo/accu-rainjpg-0fb861e216ceee74.jpg", "title": "Severe thunderstorms possible tonight; approaching cold front should break heat", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, September 06, 2014,  5:03 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/StephenDStirling"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, September 06, 2014,  1:39 PM", "article_author": "Stephen Stirling | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "Damaging winds and flooding rains are possible."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2389\"", "article_summary": "When the cold front passes over the state tonight, it will signal the end to a week marked by heat and humidity in New Jersey.\nA cold-front is approaching from the west and is expected to trigger thunderstorm activity in the afternoon and evening.\nDamaging winds are possible where the strongest storms develop and localized flooding is possible statewide as torrential rains are expected to accompany any storms that develop.\nThe abundant heat and humidity is creating a highly unstable and moisture-laden atmosphere, a veritable powder keg waiting for a match in terms of thunderstorm development.\nTemperatures are nudging above 90 degrees in many areas, and with high humidity, it feels like more than a 100 in some parts of the state."}
