It's intended to be a permanent installation.\n\nFunded by the city and various individual and corporate donors, the $750,000 piece will make its public debut on May 22 as part of a planned three-day celebration over Memorial Day weekend.\n\nShakespeare recently arrived in the city to oversee assembly and installation of the sculpture, a process that is expected to take about two months.\n\nSome of the pieces, including a number of massive LED lights from Denmark, have already started to arrive at an off-site storage facility provided by Holladay Properties.\n\nShakespeare's accommodations -- a condo at American Trust Place, a short walk from the project site downtown -- are courtesy of Bradley Company.\n\nIn addition to the two sets of light towers, the work will include a \"light crescent\" to illuminate the early Victorian-era dam; theatrical-style lighting under the arches and on the columns of the bridge; and an array of \"uplights\" below the kinetic di Suvero sculpture.\n\nAs with the towers, the light crescent -- located on the east side of the river, just north of the dam -- will respond to motion, with the ability to send waves of color across the dam.\n\n\"It's exhilarating,\" said Aaron Perri, executive director of Downtown South Bend Inc. \"Many people have had many visions for this site for a long time, a lot of them involving light, so it's really exciting to see (the project) in its final phase.\"\n\nLooking out over the cascades, Shakespeare, a professor emeritus in the Department of Theatre, Drama and Contemporary Dance at Indiana University Bloomington, described how local history and nature helped to inform the design of the piece.\n\n\"It's a spectacular setting. It's a gorgeous combination of nature flowing through here and then what the community over its history has built around it, to harness it and to make it more visually appealing with the cascades,\" he said.\n\n\"And so that became the core of the idea of, well, let's light the water.\"\n\n\"This is one of those things that is going to be iconic for South Bend,\" said Perri. \"The river is such an important part of our city's history -- it's what the Pokagons used as a travel route, what fur traders used as a trade route, and what industry used for power at the peak of manufacturing. So to be able to highlight the river in this fashion is pretty special.\"\n\nChallenges\n\nThe owner of Shakespeare Lighting Design, Shakespeare spent a few years working on the piece in collaboration with a number of local stakeholders, including the city and Downtown South Bend Inc.\n\nIn terms of interaction, the main components of the sculpture expand upon \"Light Totem,\" a previous work of his that sits outside the Indiana University Art Museum.\n\nLike \"River Lights,\" \"Light Totem\" -- a 70-foot tower lighting the otherwise austere fa\u00e7ade of the museum -- responds to motion, but in a less sophisticated way, Shakespeare said.\n\nSome of Shakespeare's other works include the Lilly House at the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the exhibition spaces at the IU Museum of Art and the linked Kap Shui Mun and Tsing Ma bridges in Hong Kong.\n\nThat said, \"River Lights\" presented its own unique challenges, he said.\n\nIt took the help of a local engineering firm to figure out how to install the light crescent, which will sit along a narrow section of river walk that is supported by caged rock.\n\nAnd crews are still working out how to install lights beneath the arches of the Jefferson Boulevard Bridge.\n\nYet another issue: How to get the 30-foot towers that make up the \"Light Trio\" onto Island Park, where access is limited to two narrow foot bridges -- on the north and south sides of the island.\n\nAfter some initial planning, Shakespeare will spend much of the next several weeks assembling the sculpture off-site. The pieces will then be moved on-site and installed with the help of local contractors.\n\n\"Everything gets installed by early May, and then Rob has three weeks to work his magic on the programming and everything,\" Perri said. \"So that will be a lot of late nights for Rob -- or early mornings.\"\n\nHelp wanted\n\nPerri said volunteers, including an electrician and a concrete contractor, are still needed to help with assembly and installation. People are welcome to provide meals to the work crews as well.\n\nDowntown South Bend is also looking to sell more bricks for the commemorative plaza, he said. The bricks cost $150 each and can be inscribed with a name or personal message.\n\n\"We need to sell a few more bricks,\" Perri said. \"And by a few, I mean a few hundred.\"\n\nMuch like the plaza, the project itself represents the combined efforts of many.\n\n\"It would have been nice to say there's one major donor and we can hire all these contractors and get it all taken care of,\" Perri said. \"But I think it means a lot more ... that this is truly a project that's been envisioned and made possible by the community.\"\n\nAnd for the community, he said.\n\n\"This is a breathing piece of art that changes with the seasons, that changes with motion activation and how people approach it, and their imagination will continue to create light effects every night,\" he said.\n\neblasko@sbtinfo.com\n\n574-235-6187\n\n@ErinBlasko", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "South Bend Tribune", "description": "Designer dives into plans to create\u00a0an interactive light sculpture that spans the river; project to be unveiled in May", "title": "Lighting up South Bend and the river", "url": "http://www.southbendtribune.com/news/local/lighting-up-south-bend-and-the-river/article_fa8d1d1e-d076-11e4-9fb0-ffaf1fc0760c.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/fe/1fee3106-d077-11e4-8862-fb7d52daef2e/550e8da37da46.image.jpg?resize=760%2C535", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/southbendtribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/fe/1fee3106-d077-11e4-8862-fb7d52daef2e/550e8da37da46.image.jpg?resize=760%2C535", "description": "Designer dives into plans to create\u00a0an interactive light sculpture that spans the river; project to be unveiled in May", "site": "@sbtribune", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Lighting up South Bend and the river"}, "description": "Designer dives into plans to create\u00a0an interactive light sculpture that spans the river; project to be unveiled in May", "Published Date": "2015-03-22T06:00:00", "fb": {"app_id": 368553839952510}, "keywords": "local,featured", "google-site-verification": "3g1dW83HuQbWT4MB-AtH0czzqvwh0eF8rwGwC6sjOhM", "news_keywords": "local,featured"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda075\"", "article_summary": "Some three years in the making, River Lights was commissioned by Downtown South Bend Inc. to mark the upcoming 150th anniversary of the city's incorporation in 1865.\nDowntown South Bend is also looking to sell more bricks for the commemorative plaza, he said.\n\"This is one of those things that is going to be iconic for South Bend,\" said Perri.\nChallengesThe owner of Shakespeare Lighting Design, Shakespeare spent a few years working on the piece in collaboration with a number of local stakeholders, including the city and Downtown South Bend Inc.\nLike \"River Lights,\" \"Light Totem\" -- a 70-foot tower lighting the otherwise austere fa\u00e7ade of the museum -- responds to motion, but in a less sophisticated way, Shakespeare said."}
