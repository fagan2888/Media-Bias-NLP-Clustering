(Susan Walsh/AP)\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled Monday that a Depression-era government program that requires farmers to turn over part of their raisin crops to boost market prices is an unconstitutional taking of private property.\n\nThe court ruled 8 to 1 that the government could not take the raisins without providing adequate compensation.\n\nThe court issued decisions in several lower-profile cases out of the 11 remaining cases Monday, but did not announce highly anticipated rulings on whether the Constitution requires that same-sex couples be allowed to marry nationwide and on the latest challenge to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe justices will issue more opinions Thursday and Friday, and end their work for the term next week.\n\nInstead of releasing decisions on lethal injection or the powers of the Environmental Protection Agency, the court ruled on a case from the inventor of a Spider-Man toy and the right of police to inspect registers at motels in Los Angeles.\n\nIn the raisin case, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said it was not an adequate response from the government to say that if farmers don\u2019t want to follow the rules of the raisin market, they can grow something else or find an alternative use for their grapes.\n\n\u201c \u2018Let them sell wine\u2019 is probably not much more comforting to the raisin growers than similar retorts have been to others throughout history,\u201d Roberts wrote.\n\n[One grower\u2019s grapes of wrath]\n\nCongress enacted the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act in 1937 to regulate markets and thereby stabilize prices, and the Raisin Administrative Committee was established in 1949 to govern California raisins, which make up 99.5 percent of the domestic market.\n\nRaisin producers send their crops to raisin \u201chandlers\u201d \u2014 packagers \u2014 who are instructed by the committee to set aside a portion that will not make it to the open market. That portion is sold through other channels, such as on the international market or to school lunch programs, and any profits are distributed to the producers. Sometimes there are no profits.\n\nThe case was brought by Marvin and Laura Horne, who were fined nearly $700,000 for trying to get around the program in 2002.\n\nThe Hornes, growers in Fresno, set themselves up as handlers and bought raisins for others. But they declined to set aside the specified portions and were fined.\n\nBacked by conservative groups, the Hornes sued, arguing that the Constitution requires that when the government takes someone\u2019s property, there must be just compensation, whether what is taken is land or personal property.\n\nRoberts agreed. \u201cNothing in the text or history of the Takings Clause, or our precedents, suggests that the rule is any different when it comes to appropriation of personal property,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe Government has a categorical duty to pay just compensation when it takes your car, just as when it takes your home.\u201d\n\nThe case couldn\u2019t be compared to a previous ruling that said a pesticide company must comply with a government licensing program in order to sell its product, Roberts said: \u201cRaisins are not dangerous pesticides; they are a healthy snack.\u201d\n\nSeven other members of the court endorsed Roberts\u2019s basic view of the case. But three broke off when it came to the matter of how to calculate the compensation.\n\nJustice Stephen G. Breyer said the case should be returned to a lower court to determine exactly how much the Hornes were owed for their raisins. The government\u2019s marketing efforts \u201cmay afford just compensation for the takings of the raisins that it imposes,\u201d Breyer wrote. He was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan.\n\nBut Roberts said the government already determined the worth of the raisins by the price it set at the time and the fines it imposed.\n\n\u201cThe Hornes should simply be relieved of the obligation to pay the fine and associated civil penalty they were assessed when they resisted the Government\u2019s effort to take their raisins,\u201d he said. \u201cThis case, in litigation for more than a decade, has gone on long enough.\u201d\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor was the lone dissenter. She said that the specifics of the program did not amount to a physical taking of the raisins and that the farmers benefited from the higher prices that came with holding some of their product out of the market.\n\nThe case is Horne v. Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe justices split 6 to 3 in a case asking the court to overturn one of its precedents; it was made more lively by the fact that, as Kagan said in announcing the decision, \u201cit\u2019s a story that happens to begin with Spider-Man.\u201d\n\nStephen Kimble, who made millions from his idea for a glove that shoots pressurized foam string to approximate the abilities of the comic-book web-slinger, said there was no time limit in his contract for royalties from Marvel Entertainment.\n\n[The time the court quoted a comic book]\n\nBut Marvel discovered a 1964 Supreme Court decision, Brulotte v. Thys Co., which said that a patent holder cannot charge royalties for the use of his invention after its patent term has ended. Marvel stopped paying Kimble.\n\nUnder the court\u2019s principle of stare decisis \u2014 meaning it lets settled law remain settled absent an extraordinary reason for change \u2014 Kimble had not shown such a reason, Kagan said. The Brulotte decision has been around for decades, she said, and if it is to be changed, Congress should do it.\n\n\u201cPatents endow their holders with certain superpowers, but only for a limited time,\u201d Kagan wrote, adding:\n\n\u201cThe parties set no end date for royalties, apparently contemplating that they would continue for as long as kids want to imitate Spider-Man (by doing whatever a spider can).\u201d\n\nRoberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. dissented and said Brulotte should be overturned.\n\nThe case is Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment.\n\nBy a 5-to-4 vote, the court overturned a Los Angeles law that allowed police to demand a hotel\u2019s register at any time for inspection and imposed criminal penalties for those who failed to comply.\n\nSotomayor wrote for the majority that the law had to allow an objecting motel owner \u201can opportunity to have a neutral decisionmaker review an officer\u2019s demand to search the registry before he or she faces penalties for failing to comply.\u201d\n\nPolice say inspection on demand is needed to make sure motel owners comply with the recordkeeping law, which is intended to deter criminal conduct in motel rooms.\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia said the majority opinion was \u201cwrongheaded.\u201d The majority\u2019s proposal that police could guard the registry while seeking a warrant was \u201cequal parts 1984 and Alice in Wonderland.\u201d\n\nThe case is Los Angeles v.
