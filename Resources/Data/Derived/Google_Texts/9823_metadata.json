John Kasich\u2019s presidential campaign has gone nowhere even though top-tier candidates haven\u2019t bothered to attack his support for Obamacare. When the last fumes of gas in the Kasich for Us Bus run out, the Republican will return his attention to Ohio; this might be the scariest news of all for Ohio taxpayers.\n\nKasich\u2019s Medicaid expansion has cost federal taxpayers more than $5 billion in less than two years, and the state will be on the hook for part of the costs starting in 2017. The governor backed Republican legislative supermajorities in the Ohio House and Ohio Senate into a corner on Medicaid, convincing most to sign off on a continuation of Obamacare\u2019s welfare coverage for working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities.\n\nOn energy policy, in particular, Kasich has unfinished business that could be a boon for \u201cgreen energy\u201d lobbyists and a burden for everyone else. Shrugging off as \u201cunacceptable\u201d lawmakers\u2019 recommendation to stop ratcheting up costly state energy targets, Kasich seems ready to fight for steeper mandates on efficiency and electricity generation. Kasich continues to push for a big tax hike on fracking for oil and natural gas, too.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "When John Kasich's 2016 presidential campaign expires, he will turn his attention back to Ohio; this might be the scariest news of all for Ohio taxpayers.", "title": "Watchdog's Scariest People of 2015: No. 22 - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/09/john-kasich-state-of-ohio-2014-10-15.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-22T13:43:11+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/251493/watchdogs-scariest-people-2015-no-22/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Energy and Environment", "tag": "2016 presidential campaign,John Kasich,medicaid,Ohio", "published_time": "2015-12-28T04:04:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-22T13:43:11+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "When John Kasich's 2016 presidential campaign expires, he will turn his attention back to Ohio; this might be the scariest news of all for Ohio taxpayers.", "title": "Watchdog's Scariest People of 2015: No. 22 - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/09/john-kasich-state-of-ohio-2014-10-15.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "When John Kasich's 2016 presidential campaign expires, he will turn his attention back to Ohio; this might be the scariest news of all for Ohio taxpayers."}, "article_summary": "Shrugging off as \u201cunacceptable\u201d lawmakers\u2019 recommendation to stop ratcheting up costly state energy targets, Kasich seems ready to fight for steeper mandates on efficiency and electricity generation.\nJohn Kasich\u2019s presidential campaign has gone nowhere even though top-tier candidates haven\u2019t bothered to attack his support for Obamacare.\nOn energy policy, in particular, Kasich has unfinished business that could be a boon for \u201cgreen energy\u201d lobbyists and a burden for everyone else.\nKasich continues to push for a big tax hike on fracking for oil and natural gas, too.\nWhen the last fumes of gas in the Kasich for Us Bus run out, the Republican will return his attention to Ohio; this might be the scariest news of all for Ohio taxpayers."}
