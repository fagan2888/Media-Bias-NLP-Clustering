The co-op reported a net loss of $23 million last year.\n\n\u201cWe really are counting on that money,\u201d Colorado HealthOP CEO Julia Hutchins said.\n\nState regulators will tell Colorado HealthOP in the next two weeks whether it will be allowed to offer insurance plans for 2016. Open enrollment starts in about three weeks.\n\nThat\u2019s putting customers like Mark and Ilene Reinhart of Centennial in a bind.\n\nThe Reinharts \u2014 both part-time workers with no employer health insurance \u2014 have been with Colorado HealthOP since it launched last year. They say there should be a national outcry over the federal government failing to honor payments to insurers.\n\n\u201cOver the last couple years, they\u2019ve done their part with the federal government,\u201d Mark Reinhart said of Colorado HealthOP. \u201cIf they\u2019ve done their part \u2014 the government really needs to step up somehow.\u201d\n\nBut experts say that\u2019s unlikely to happen. Technically, the health care law obligates the government to pay insurers for their claims. But the legislation did not clearly specify how that would happen.\n\nThe Republican-led Congress is unlikely to allocate any additional money for the program, a temporary stabilization fund that lasts three years. Of the original 23 health insurance co-ops created by the federal law, four have collapsed \u2014 Iowa/Nebraska, Louisiana, Nevada and New York.\n\nColorado HealthOP insists that it has a plan to survive and that federal authorities will change course and make the payments. But critics of the health law say a federal about-face is unlikely and that low-cost insurance cooperatives relying on government support shouldn\u2019t be in business.\n\nFour days after the government announced the slashed insurance payments, Republican U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner wrote to Colorado HealthOP asking about its plan to survive. Gardner said the cooperative\u2019s records show that its finances are in some ways more precarious than the co-ops that have already closed. He said taxpayers won\u2019t recover those loans.\n\n\u201cWhat is the estimated ability of Colorado HealthOP to repay its loans?\u201d Gardner asked in an Oct. 28 letter. He hasn\u2019t yet received a reply.\n\nHutchins told The Associated Press that the federal payments should not be seen as handouts but as a necessary short-term investment to help nonprofit co-ops get established.\n\n\u201cThis is really to help stabilize the market, help keep prices low as we make the transition,\u201d Hutchins said of the payments. \u201cRight now we\u2019re fighting like hell to make Congress make good on its obligations. We\u2019re confident we will prevail.\u201d\n\nWith just three weeks until the start of open enrollment, the window is closing for customers like the Reinharts to keep insurance through Colorado HealthOP.\n\n\u201cIt offers great coverage for people like us,\u201d said Ilene Reinhart, who has written to Congress seeking additional money for the fund keeping Colorado HealthOP afloat. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at continuing it until we can\u2019t any further.\u201d\n\nBy Kristen Wyatt, AP Writer\n\n(\u00a9 Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
