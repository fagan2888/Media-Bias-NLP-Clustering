(Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\n\nTerry McAuliffe is Virginia\u2019s governor-in-waiting. And he is no good at waiting.\n\nSo he is hiring. Phoning. Meeting. Schmoozing. Strategizing. And, yes, sleeping \u2014 but only the four to four and a half hours that the former Democratic National Committee chairman and entrepreneur considers a good night\u2019s rest.\n\n\u201cI love life. I love getting things done,\u201d he said in an interview with The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cI just wish I didn\u2019t ever have to sleep. But it is what it is. It\u2019s the human body, and I can\u2019t change it.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe, who will be sworn in as the state\u2019s 72nd governor Saturday, has always been a man in a hurry; he started a driveway-sealing business at 14, using a hand-me-down truck that, legally, he was too young to drive.\n\nAdding to his congenital sense of urgency: a state constitution that prohibits the governor from running again in four years and a legislative calendar that will have the General Assembly already three days into its 60-day session when he takes office. For a man who in his first year alone hopes to sell legislators on expanding Medicaid and pre-kindergarten programs, tightening gift laws and improving mental-health care, there is no time to waste.\n\nIn an interview in his temporary office on Capitol Square, overlooking the dazzling white Capitol, McAuliffe looked ahead to the legislative session that begins Wednesday. The governor-elect discussed policy goals as well as an overarching desire to set a constructive, bipartisan tone. He described the nuts and bolts of his transition, from drumming up interim staff with no money to getting fitted for a morning suit at Men\u2019s Wearhouse. Above all, he made clear that he\u2019s set a frenetic pace since winning the Nov. 5 election over Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II (R).\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent almost every day on the phone calling all over \u2014 nation, globe \u2014 trying to recruit business,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t stopped for a second. I did take two days off over the holidays to take my kids to Universal Studios in Orlando. It was great.\u201d\n\nThe most visible product of all that activity has been McAuliffe\u2019s Cabinet nominations. As someone who has never held elective office and was unable to name the Cabinet positions early in the campaign, he satisfied some critics by picking a number of experienced Richmond hands .\n\nMcAuliffe has spent hours with outgoing Gov. Robert F. McDonnell going over the two-year, $96 billion budget plan that the Republican will leave behind for his successor and the legislature to amend as they see fit.\n\nA less-weighty matter recently took McAuliffe to Men\u2019s Wearhouse, where he was fitted for a gray morning suit. The formal attire is dictated by the state\u2019s Inauguration Day protocol, which also calls for a ceremonial handoff of the key to the Executive Mansion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a big man on black-tie events,\u201d he said. \u201cI always bark, \u2018Why can\u2019t I wear a suit?\u2019 But yeah, I\u2019ve been fitted. And I will have my morning suit on. Tradition. There\u2019s a whole protocol here.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s transition work started the day after the election, in offices the state provided in Richmond\u2019s ornate Old City Hall.\n\n\u201cI remember the first day, we said, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s hire some people, get them in here going,\u2019 \u201d McAuliffe said.\n\nThen came his biggest surprise to date: He learned that the state furnishes its governor-elect with an office, but no funds for a staff.\n\n\u201cThey march you into this beautiful office. There\u2019s a desk, a chair and a phone \u2014 and no transition money. And they say, \u2018Good luck,\u2019 \u201d said McAuliffe, who has been able to staff the office with campaign volunteers.\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s win puts his family in transition along with him. He and his wife, Dorothy McAuliffe, have five children, three of them in college. The youngest two and their mother will remain at the family\u2019s Fairfax County home until they finish the school year and then move into the mansion.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to take a \u00ad14-year-old girl out of eighth grade,\u201d McAuliffe said. He noted that his wife was exploring \u00adschool options in the Richmond area for fall \u2014 a task he made sound more daunting than selling House Republicans on President Obama\u2019s health-care program.\n\n\u201cDorothy\u2019s beginning that process, and she\u2019s getting plenty of advice,\u201d McAuliffe said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m staying out of that.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe sold himself to voters as a pragmatic dealmaker who would reach across the aisle to get things done. Republicans portrayed him as an untrustworthy Washington insider. The champion political fundraiser and close friend of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton has a history of controversial business and political deals , including GreenTech , a troubled electric car company he co-founded. Federal investigators last year launched two investigations related to GreenTech\u2019s use of a visa program to attract foreign investors.\n\nMcAuliffe has spent a good deal of his transition time trying to build personal trust with Republicans who knew him only from news accounts.\n\n\u201cI think many of the Republicans that I\u2019ve met with . . . may have only known what they read,\u201d McAuliffe said. \u201cBut they sit with me and . . . they say, \u2018Well, he\u2019s really a pretty good guy. He is what he says he is.\u2019 So it will take time. And listen, I don\u2019t think one meeting with someone is going to, you know \u2014 this is about building relationships. I have no illusions. This is the beginning of a process.\u201d\n\nOne of McAuliffe\u2019s main policy goals, expanding Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act, faces fierce opposition from House Republicans. McAuliffe said the expansion would provide 400,000 Virginians with health-care coverage and pump $5 million a day into the state\u2019s economy. The federal government has promised to pay the full cost initially and 90 percent after that. Republicans doubt that Washington can afford to make good on that deal.\n\nOther priorities include expanding and diversifying the economy, reforming school standardized tests and tightening lax ethics laws .\n\nRepublicans say they share some of his goals, particularly when it comes to job creation and ethics reform, an issue brought into focus by a gifts scandal that has consumed McDonnell\u2019s last year in office.\n\n\u201cWe have met and talked about areas where we have common interests, common ground,\u201d said House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford), who remains opposed to expanding Medicaid and pre-kindergarten programs. \u201cWe\u2019re all kind of waiting to see what his agenda is and what he\u2019s got. And where we can, we\u2019ll work with him. And where we can\u2019t, we won\u2019t.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Virginia\u2019s legislature begins its session before the new governor is sworn in, and McAuliffe can\u2019t wait.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Virginia\u2019s legislature begins its session before the new governor is sworn in, and McAuliffe can\u2019t wait.", "title": "For Virginia\u2019s governor-in-waiting, there\u2019s no time to waste", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/virginias-governor-in-waiting-is-a-man-in-a-hurry/2014/01/04/03808ea0-74cb-11e3-9389-09ef9944065e_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/01/04/Others/Images/2014-01-04/gov0011388863691.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@LVozzella"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, terry mcauliffe, governor mcauliffe, bob mcdonnell, mcauliffe inauguration, virginia inauguration, ken cuccinelli, greentech, medicaid expansion, obamacare, medicaid virginia, obamacare virginia, mcdonnell gifts, mcdonnell scandal, star scientific, dorothy mcauliffe, bill howell, speaker howell", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella"}, "news_keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, terry mcauliffe, governor mcauliffe, bob mcdonnell, mcauliffe inauguration, virginia inauguration, ken cuccinelli, greentech, medicaid expansion, obamacare, medicaid virginia, obamacare virginia, mcdonnell gifts, mcdonnell scandal, star scientific, dorothy mcauliffe, bill howell, speaker howell", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "03808ea0-74cb-11e3-9389-09ef9944065e"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc45\"", "article_summary": "(Sarah L.
