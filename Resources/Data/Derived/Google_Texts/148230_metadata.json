Last week, he promised an \u201cadministrative fix\u201d for Obamacare, which was nothing more than an attempt to revive his tanking poll numbers, protect at-risk Democrats up for reelection in 2014, and deflect blame to insurance companies.\n\nObama doesn\u2019t care that his \u201cadministrative fix\u201d won\u2019t fix anything. What he really cares about is his party regaining control for his last two years in office. And if they do, expect Democrats to bring about a \u201creal\u201d Obamacare fix by fulfilling their lifelong dream of socialized medicine in America.\n\nThose with common sense question the constitutionality of Obama\u2019s newest proposal, and surely Obama knows full well it\u2019s a logistic impossibility to reinstate insurance plans for a year. But, he\u2019ll say anything to deflect blame. That\u2019s how he rolls. Lest we forget:\n\nHe once blamed the Founding Fathers for creating a system of checks and balances which prevented him from achieving the radical change he believed in.\n\nHigh gas prices were blamed on big oil companies and big cable networks like Fox News got the rap for his unpopularity. He blamed President Reagan for federal deficit spending and then blamed Congress for his. He blamed Rush Limbaugh for the partisanship in D.C. and then blamed being a dad for his own partisanship, and later said \u201cpartisan brinkmanship\u201d was the reason for America\u2019s first-ever credit rating downgrade.\n\nHe blamed his predecessor for everything under the sun and then blamed Republicans for blaming him for blaming Bush.\n\nState and local government caused high black unemployment, the rich were blamed for poverty; technology for weak job numbers; generic \u201cbad decisions\u201d for the weak economy, and that same weak economy was why he didn\u2019t keep his promise for immigration reform. John Kerry got blamed for his poor reelection debate performance and blamed \u201cbad luck\u201d for failures, \u201cmessy democracy\u201d for failed policies and blamed Congress for not closing GITMO.\n\nThe NRA was blamed for gun violence, guns were blamed for Chicago\u2019s violence, America for Mexico\u2019s, and Bush, again, for the Mexican gun running scandal Fast and Furious. He blamed workplace violence for a terrorist attack at Ft. Hood, an internet video for attacks in Benghazi, and open internet access for future terrorism.\n\nHe blamed the \u201centire world\u201d for his Syrian \u201credline\u201d statement, the Navy for America\u2019s trouble with North Korea, Europe for America\u2019s bad jobs report, a Japanese Tsunami for slow economic growth, and Hawaii for his own \u201cdeep-down laziness.\u201d\n\nHe blamed Republicans for a government shutdown and the government shutdown for Obamacare\u2019s rollout failures. He blamed \u201cbad apple \u201cinsurance companies for his broken promise that Americans could keep their plans and then turned insurers into scapegoats last week when he offered a plan for extension, knowing future cancellations will be blamed on them.\n\nObamacare is self-imploding under its own ineptitude. Even if it was logistically feasible, Obama\u2019s \u201cadministrative fix\u201d is like plugging a hole in a leaky dam with bubble gum. It may hold for a moment, but it will eventually come crashing down.\n\nIt is reassuring to know Republicans back in 2009 had the wisdom to see Obamacare for what it was. Not a single Republican voted for it while Democrats like Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) ran around the country telling Americans, \u201cWe have to pass the bill so that you can find out what\u2019s in it.\u201d Americans already know, you can sprinkle sugar on a pile of manure, but in the end it\u2019s still a cow patty.\n\nSusan Stamper Brown is an opinion page columnist who writes about politics, the economy and culture.
