The New York contingent, in particular, will be salivating over the possibility of Tulo replacing Derek Jeter as the Yankees\u2019 shortstop in 2015.\n\nTulo will say the right things. He will try to deflect all of the speculation, but it\u2019s not going to go away.\n\nTulo would be happy to work on his craft and continue his push for the National League MVP, if only the Rockies were winning and if they were true contenders. But they aren\u2019t, and they don\u2019t look to be anytime soon \u2014 and that alone will likely deny Tulo any chance to win the MVP this year.\n\nSo the future has become part of Tulo\u2019s present.\n\nUnderstand, Tulo is not demanding a trade. He has not marched up to owner Dick Monfort\u2019s office and asked to get out of Denver. Not yet.\n\nAnd Monfort has no plans to deal either Tulo or Carlos Gonzalez. Yet.\n\nMonfort said after last season: \u201cThe plan is to keep them. Next year, yes. Is that the smartest thing in the world to do? I don\u2019t know. But for our fans, I think it\u2019s the best thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut another losing season has changed the landscape. Tulo, at age 29, has shown that he\u2019s healthy although he sat out Friday and Saturday with groin tightness and leg injuries will always be a concern with his injury history. He is at the peak of his trade value. Now or never is drawing nearer if the Rockies are going to move him. His value might never be higher.\n\nTulo doesn\u2019t come across as warm and cuddly, but he has told me countless times that he loves the Rockies and their fans and he likes being the face of the franchise. But more than anything, he wants to win. And he wants to be surrounded by players who want to win as passionately as he does.\n\n\u201cIn Todd Helton, there\u2019s someone who\u2019s easy to look at his career here and how it played out. I have the utmost respect for Todd, but at the same time, I don\u2019t want to be the next in line as somebody who was here for a long time and didn\u2019t have a chance to win every single year,\u201d Tulowitzki told Denver Post columnist Mark Kiszla on Thursday. \u201cHe played in a couple postseason games and went to one World Series. But that\u2019s not me. I want to be somewhere where there\u2019s a chance to be in the playoffs every single year.\u201d\n\nBut wishing for a trade, or speculating about one, is a lot easier than actually pulling off a deal. And keep in mind that Tulo can veto any trade, so he\u2019s not going to end up in someplace like Houston or San Diego.\n\nTulo carries a big contract, so that\u2019s a huge factor. The Rockies\u2019 star shortstop will be due $118 million after this season on a deal that runs through 2020, with a club option for 2021. There are only a few, select teams that would be willing to carry that load.\n\nThe Yankees might, but the Rockies are going to demand a lot of prospects in return, and the Yankees farm system is not loaded with talent.\n\nTulo would look best in Cardinals red. Indeed, St. Louis and Colorado talked about a deal last winter that included pitcher Shelby Miller, first baseman Matt Adams and a prospect coming to Colorado.\n\nEarly this season, Fox Sports\u2019s Ken Rosenthal pitched the following idea: Tulo to the Cardinals for first baseman/outfielder Allen Craig, right-handers Shelby Miller and Trevor Rosenthal and a fourth, lesser prospect, with the Rockies paying some of Tulowitzki\u2019s remaining contact. That deal is a real longshot, but talent-rich St. Louis remains the most viable trade partner. And the Cardinals are in contention every year.\n\nDo I think Tulo is going to be dealt? Not this summer, I don\u2019t, but it wouldn\u2019t shock me to see him traded over the winter. I would hate to see him go, because I love watching him play. But a fresh start would do Tulo good.\n\nAnd a major shakeup might be best for the Rockies.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Saunders: Troy Tulowitzki\u2019s trade value may never be higher for Rockies", "title": "Saunders: Troy Tulowitzki\u2019s trade value may never be higher for Rockies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/05/saunders-troy-tulowitzkis-trade-value-may-never-be-higher-for-rockies/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140615__tulo-socialp1.jpg", "height": 405}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140615__tulo-socialp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-05T20:48:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:31:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd09c7\"", "article_summary": "But they aren\u2019t, and they don\u2019t look to be anytime soon \u2014 and that alone will likely deny Tulo any chance to win the MVP this year.\nTroy Tulowitzki trade talk is heating up, and it\u2019s only going to get hotter.\nNow or never is drawing nearer if the Rockies are going to move him.\nThe Yankees might, but the Rockies are going to demand a lot of prospects in return, and the Yankees farm system is not loaded with talent.\nAnd keep in mind that Tulo can veto any trade, so he\u2019s not going to end up in someplace like Houston or San Diego."}
