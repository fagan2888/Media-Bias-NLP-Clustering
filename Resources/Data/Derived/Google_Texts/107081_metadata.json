(Photo courtesy of Code Pink)\n\nThis Mother\u2019s Day weekend, moms across the United States are leading protests, vigils, and marches to demand justice for children slain by police and vigilante violence\u2014and to send the message to parents and young people alike that Black Lives Matter.\n\nFrom Chicago to Washington, D.C., many of those organizing mobilizations on Saturday and Sunday are mothers who have lost their own children.\n\n\u201cWhat better way to spend my Mother\u2019s Day than to be fighting for my child,\u201d said Panzy Edwards, whose 15-year-old son Dakota Bright was shot in the head and killed by a Chicago police officer in November 2012. \u201cI\u2019m marching to honor my son\u2019s life that was taken by the Chicago police department,\u201d Edwards told Common Dreams. \u201cI\u2019m marching to honor lives taken by police everywhere.\u201d\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nPanzy Edwards is not alone in her loss. According to a report released in April 2013 by the Malcom X Grassroots Movement, in 2012 an average of one black person was killed every 28 hours through extrajudicial means\u2014by police, security guard, or vigilante violence. Beyond killings, studies show that black communities are also disproportionately criminalized by law enforcement: a report released last November by USA Today found that, in all of the 3,538 police departments investigated, black people are more likely to be arrested than non-black racial groups for every type of criminal charge.\n\n\u201cMy purpose is to shed light on the fact our kids are being killed in the south side of Chicago,\u201d said Edwards. \u201cI don\u2019t think people really understand how hurtful, how painful, how much agony comes with what they\u2019re doing to us. The city says \u2018we feel your pain,\u2019 but they\u2019re not giving us anything. We\u2019re fed up. Iam fighting every day so that my son\u2019s voice can be heard. I\u2019m fighting for other mothers alongside me.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, protesters will gather at the location where Dakota Bright was shot, in a city still reeling from the recent \u201cnot guilty\u201d charge for the police officer who shot and killed black woman Rekia Boyd.\n\n(Image courtesy of Panzy Edwards)\n\nThey will be joined by people taking similar action across the country, in step with growing nation-wide movements for racial justice\u2014what many are calling Black Spring.\n\nThis includes hundreds participating in the Millions Mom March that kicked off Saturday afternoon in Washington, DC.\n\n\u201cThis Mother\u2019s Day, let\u2019s come together to demand an end to this cycle of violence, this society of institutionalized racism and police militarization,\u201d wrote Valerie Bell, ahead of the march. The mother of Sean Elijah Bell, who was killed by New York plainclothes police officers on his wedding day in November 2006 at the age of 23, Valerie Bell added, \u201cWe are healers, teachers, caretakers, givers of life, and so much more. Mothers are powerful; if we come together, we can be unstoppable.\u201d\n\nBell is joined in the capital by mothers across the country, who will march to the Department of Justice, where they will \u201cpresent their demands for justice and racial equality, in the names of their slain children,\u201d according to a statement from Mothers United for Justice, whose members have traveled from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\n#MillionMomsMarch Tweets\n\nOrganizers emphasize that, while it\u2019s important to make visible the role of mothers in the movement for racial justice, their leadership is nothing new.\n\nAudrey Stewart is organizing a Mother\u2019s Day Gathering for Black Lives in New Orleans on Sunday as part of the informal collective Mothers With a Vision, mostly comprised of mothers with black children. In an interview with Common Dreams, Stewart said that \u201cfor generations in this country, it has been mothers picking up the pieces of state violence against communities of color and leading the charge to defend their families and children.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have concerned about the way that women and transgender women\u2019s experiences haven\u2019t always been centered in the coverage of police killings,\u201d Stewart added. \u201cWe felt it was an important time to speak to women\u2019s experiences and how black women and black transgender people are affected.\u201d\n\nAccording to report entitled We Deserve Better, published in 2014 by the the youth of color-led LGBTQ organization BreakOUT!, 84 percent of transgender people say they have been profiled by police on the bases of gender identity or sexual orientation in New Orleans, and 42 percent of LGBTQ people of color say they have been arrested after calling the police for help.\n\nIn 2015 alone, numerous transgender women of color across the United States have been murdered, including: Penny Proud, Goddess Edwards, Michelle (Yazmin) Vash Payne, Ty Underwood, Lamia Beard, Taja Gabrielle De Jesus. In addition, one gender non-conforming person of color, Lamar Edwards, was killed this year.\n\n\u201cAs mothers, we have problems with what is going on around the country,\u201d said Stewart. \u201cWhat everyone is talking about right now in Ferguson and Baltimore\u2014the police killing of black men and women\u2014is nothing new, but we are seeing increased attention to issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs mothers of black children, we want to see a world where our children are safe and valued and grow up knowing their lives matter,\u201d Stewart added. \u201cIt is an important time for us to come together and envision the world we want to create.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nation-wide protests and vigils highlight growing movement for racial justice.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Sarah Lazare | Common Dreams", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Nation-wide protests and vigils highlight growing movement for racial justice.", "title": "'Our Kids Are Being Killed': On Mother's Day Weekend, Moms Are Rising Up For Black Lives", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/our-kids-are-being-killed-on-mothers-day-weekend-moms-are-rising-up-for-black-lives/205489/", "image": "http://commondreams.org/sites/default/files/new_orleans.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nation-wide protests and vigils highlight growing movement for racial justice.", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dc_rally_1.jpg", "title": "'Our Kids Are Being Killed': On Mother's Day Weekend, Moms Are Rising Up For Black Lives", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Police", "published_time": "2015-05-09T13:56:51-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2347\"", "article_summary": "Audrey Stewart is organizing a Mother\u2019s Day Gathering for Black Lives in New Orleans on Sunday as part of the informal collective Mothers With a Vision, mostly comprised of mothers with black children.\n\u201cThis Mother\u2019s Day, let\u2019s come together to demand an end to this cycle of violence, this society of institutionalized racism and police militarization,\u201d wrote Valerie Bell, ahead of the march.\n(Photo courtesy of Code Pink)This Mother\u2019s Day weekend, moms across the United States are leading protests, vigils, and marches to demand justice for children slain by police and vigilante violence\u2014and to send the message to parents and young people alike that Black Lives Matter.\n#MillionMomsMarch TweetsOrganizers emphasize that, while it\u2019s important to make visible the role of mothers in the movement for racial justice, their leadership is nothing new.\nMothers whose children have been killed by police gather in Washington, D.C. on Saturday."}
