Circulating CD3+ cells were found to be lower in MS patients as compared with the controls and HIV patients.2. Both HIV groups (relapse and remission and ART-treated patients) showed higher circulating CD3+ lymphocytes than both RRMS patients in relapse and in remission.3. Circulating CD8+ cells were increased in both ART-treated HIV groups as compared to RRMS patients both in relapse and in remission, and to healthy controls.4. The CD4/CD8 ratio was reduced in both ART-treated HIV groups as compared to healthy subjects and to RRMS patients, both in relapse and in remission.Experts attribute the lack of significant reduction in the number of CD4+ lymphocytes within the HIV group to the ongoing ART. \u201cInterestingly, we found a reduction of circulating CD3+ cells in MS patients as compared both to controls and to HIV patients, suggesting their accumulation in the central nervous system as MS target organ,\u201d noted the authors.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Recently, researchers had discovered that HIV infection might decrease the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS).", "og": {"site_name": "MD Magazine", "description": "Recently, researchers had discovered that HIV infection might decrease the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS).", "title": "HIV and Lower Risk of Multiple Sclerosis: There is a Connection", "url": "http://www.hcplive.com/conference-coverage/actrims-2016/hiv-and-lower-risk-of-multiple-sclerosis-there-is-a-connection", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hcplive/v1_media/_upload_image/_thumbnails/Fotolia_HIV200x200.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/hcplive/v2_media/_core/favi/ms-icon-144x144.png", "keywords": "multiple sclerosis, MS, neurology, HIV, infectious disease, internal medicine, family practice, chronic inflammation", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "Circulating CD3+ cells were found to be lower in MS patients as compared with the controls and HIV patients.2.\nBoth HIV groups (relapse and remission and ART-treated patients) showed higher circulating CD3+ lymphocytes than both RRMS patients in relapse and in remission.3.\nCirculating CD8+ cells were increased in both ART-treated HIV groups as compared to RRMS patients both in relapse and in remission, and to healthy controls.4.\n\u201cInterestingly, we found a reduction of circulating CD3+ cells in MS patients as compared both to controls and to HIV patients, suggesting their accumulation in the central nervous system as MS target organ,\u201d noted the authors.\nThe CD4/CD8 ratio was reduced in both ART-treated HIV groups as compared to healthy subjects and to RRMS patients, both in relapse and in remission.Experts attribute the lack of significant reduction in the number of CD4+ lymphocytes within the HIV group to the ongoing ART."}
