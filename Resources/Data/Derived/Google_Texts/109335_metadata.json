Nothing was brought to teachers. I don\u2019t know how (Vellardita) thinks teachers ever ratified anything,\u201d said one union member who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation.\n\n\u201cNot that we don\u2019t want the money,\u201d the member added quickly.\n\nUnion representatives did not attend the school board meeting Wednesday and did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But the CCEA faces further criticism from some members for a hastily scheduled vote to ratify a new contract for all 18,000 teachers who work for the district.\n\nLast month, the district and union declared a deadlock in negotiations, with disagreements set for lengthy considerations by a third-party arbitrator. But in a surprise announcement last week, both sides celebrated a tentative settlement for the contract \u2014 only after Gov. Brian Sandoval delivered a subtle message to Vellardita and Superintendent Pat Skorkowsky.\n\n\u201cThe governor contacted myself and Mr. Vellardita and brokered a meeting to sit down and say, \u2018You know what, I really want you guys to take a look at this again,\u2019\u201d Skorkowsky said Wednesday .\n\n\u201cHe just wanted us to take a look at it,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Saturday \u2014 the day after schools break for the holidays \u2014 the CCEA will hold a meeting for members to ratify a new contract.\n\nDetails of the contract language remain secret until then, although the district and union note it includes a focus on professional development. Previous contract proposals also dramatically restructured the salary schedule for all teachers.\n\nSome teachers have complained on social media about the CCEA scheduling only three hours for discussion and ratification of the contract the day after many teachers leave town for the holidays.\n\nRuben Garcia, a law professor at UNLV, said few state regulations oversee how unions conduct internal elections or contract ratifications.\n\n\"Ironically, even for a contract ratification, there's very little regulation of ratification votes under federal law,\" Garcia said.\n\n\"But generally speaking, you figure that the union is your representative, and if you don't like what they do, in Nevada you can resign the union and vote them out,\" he said. \"You have options if you don't like the deal they strike.\"", "article_metadata": {"parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/education/school-board-oks-increased-health-care-contribution", "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-2136121"}, "author": "Neal Morton Las Vegas Review-Journal", "parsely-title": "School Board OKs increased health care contribution", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "twitter": {"description": "The Clark County School District starting next month will spend more than $8 million increasing its monthly contribution for teacher health-care premiums.", "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/education/school-board-oks-increased-health-care-contribution", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/1004350552_ccsd_control_1_7_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/1004350552_ccsd_control_1_3_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/1004350552_ccsd_control_121_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/1004350552_ccsd_control_1_8_0.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/1004350552_ccsd_control_1_5_0.jpg"}, "title": "School Board OKs increased health care contribution", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=4018745", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=4018745", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/1004350552_ccsd_control_1_7_0.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "The Clark County School District starting next month will spend more than $8 million increasing its monthly contribution for teacher health-care premiums.", "title": "School Board OKs increased health care contribution", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/education/school-board-oks-increased-health-care-contribution", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/1004350552_ccsd_control_1_7_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "parsely-author": "Neal Morton Las Vegas Review-Journal", "parsely-section": "Education", "keywords": "Education,,", "parsely-type": "post", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-16T21:25:29-08:00"}, "parsely-pub-date": "2015-12-17T05:25:29Z", "parsely-tags": "Education", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "description": "The Clark County School District starting next month will spend more than $8 million increasing its monthly contribution for teacher health-care premiums."}, "article_summary": "The Clark County School District starting next month will spend more than $8 million increasing its monthly contribution for teacher health-care premiums.\nUnion representatives did not attend the school board meeting Wednesday and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\nIn a swift and unanimous vote Wednesday , the Clark County School Board approved an agreement with the local teachers union to provide an additional $45 for each employee each month.\nSchool board records show John Vellardita, executive director of the Clark County Education Association, which represents teachers, informed the district that his union\u2019s membership ratified the deal Oct. 7 .\nLast month, the district and union declared a deadlock in negotiations, with disagreements set for lengthy considerations by a third-party arbitrator."}
