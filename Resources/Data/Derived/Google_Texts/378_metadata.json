The nation\u2019s uninsured rate is now at its lowest level ever.\n\nJoin the millions who now have access to affordable health coverage. #GetCovered today \u2192 https://t.co/5r9E9h6WeU pic.twitter.com/ejdqUECyGu \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) November 4, 2015\n\nBut in communities across the country, 10.5 million eligible people remain uninsured.\n\nThat's why the White House is reaching out to local officials in 20 key communities with high percentages of uninsured Americans in states around the country. Community collaboration with local, state and federal officials can have a meaningful impact in helping these people get the health coverage they need.\n\nAt the end of open enrollment, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), along with State-based Marketplaces, will publish tallies of new Marketplace signups in the 20 participating communities and compare them to the uninsured rates at the beginning of the open enrollment period, to see which communities have made the most progress.\n\nMost importantly, the community that gets the most coverage will get a healthier community, but they'll also receive a visit from President Obama to celebrate their success in helping ensure every American has health coverage.\n\nCommunities Participating in the \u201cHealthy Communities Challenge\u201d\n\nIf you are a member of one of these communities, you can download city-specific graphics to promote the challenge on social media, using the links below.\n\nNew Orleans, LA Share Graphic Share Video\n\nGreat Falls, MT Share Graphic Share Video\n\nKansas City, MO Share Graphic Share Video\n\nSalt Lake City, UT Share Graphic Share Video\n\nLas Vegas, NV Share Graphic Share Video\n\nLong Beach, CA Share Graphic Share Video\n\nIf you are a member of a community that is not part of the Challenge, you can still participate: Compete with a neighboring city, or reach out to your Health and Human Services Regional Director to participate in enrollment events.
