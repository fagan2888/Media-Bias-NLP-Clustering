The Act, better known as Obamacare, created the Small Business Health Option Program (SHOP), which provides for state-based health insurance exchanges designed to serve small businesses. Nationwide less than 80,000 people have enrolled in SHOP exchanges, with almost half of that number coming from one state, Vermont.\n\nOnly 2 percent of eligible small businesses have even investigated SHOPs, and even fewer have enrolled, according to John Graham of the National Center for Policy Analysis. Only 11 SHOP exchanges have been implemented. The Obama administration delayed full implementation of the program until 2015.\n\n\u201cI think that small businesses have more than enough to do dealing with customers to waste time trying to figure out how to navigate a SHOP exchange,\u201d said Graham. \u201cUnlike large businesses, they do not have lobbyists in DC to minimize the harm inflicted on them by regulations.\u201d\n\nLittle Value for Employers\n\nAccording to the Web site ACASignups.net, 88 percent of all SHOP enrollees have come from just four exchanges: California, District of Columbia, New York, and Vermont. Both Vermont and DC combined their small business and small group markets, mandating a business use the SHOP exchange if it wants to offer small group insurance to its employees.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see where the SHOP exchange really adds much value from a small employer\u2019s perspective,\u201d said Edmund Haislmaier of the Heritage Foundation, adding, \u201cSome employers might want to offer a group plan [but may be] better off just buying it through a broker with different competing insurers\u2026 There\u2019s not much reason to go on the SHOP exchange\u2026 You might actually have more options outside the SHOP exchange than on.\u201d\n\nOne of many states where enrollments through the SHOP exchange has lagged far behind projections is Rhode Island. In a May 2013 filing with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Rhode Island\u2019s exchange agency, HealthSourceRI, predicted 17,000 people would obtain coverage through the SHOP exchange in 2014.\n\nAccording HealthSourceRI, by March 31 of this year the SHOP exchange had enrolled only about 1,800 people. HealthSourceRI has declined to make more recent enrollment figures available.\n\nA 2012 report by Christine Eibner and Carter C. Price of the RAND Corporation predicted that by 2016 approximately 42 million Americans would receive their health coverage through the SHOP exchange.\n\nIndividual Exchange Better Option\n\nIt may also make more economic sense for most small employers to drop coverage and send their employees to the individual exchange. Individual employees may be better off that way as well.\n\n\u201cIf the employer provides coverage,\u201d Haislmaier said, \u201cthe money spent is money that isn\u2019t going to the employees in cash wages, but it\u2019s tax-free, so in effect there\u2019s a subsidy there. But if the employer doesn\u2019t provide it, they can normally give the employees a bit more in cash, and they go to the exchange. If they are lower-wage workers, even $15-20 an hour, they\u2019re going to be getting a bigger subsidy from the exchange.\u201d\n\nUnder the ACA, individuals are eligible for subsidies on state-based exchanges only if their employers do not offer affordable coverage.\n\nErosion in Employer Insurance\n\nHaislmaier notes the lack of interest in the SHOP exchanges by small employers is consistent with the overall decline in employer-provided health insurance, a trend that has accelerated since passage of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe bigger issue is the decline in the employer-insured market. When you look at those figures and you net it out, you see a decline in fully insured [individuals] of almost 4.8 million, and an increase in self-insured of almost a million, so your net employer market decline is about 3.8 million,\u201d Haislmaier said, citing a recent study from the Heritage Foundation showing a steep drop in the number of people receiving health insurance from their employers.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the real thing that\u2019s going on here,\u201d Haislmaier said, \u201cand it\u2019s not surprising. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve been predicting since this thing was enacted.\u201d\n\nLoren Heal (loren.heal@gmail.com) is a freelance reporter for The Heartland Institute.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc15\"", "article_summary": "Nationwide less than 80,000 people have enrolled in SHOP exchanges, with almost half of that number coming from one state, Vermont.\nThe Act, better known as Obamacare, created the Small Business Health Option Program (SHOP), which provides for state-based health insurance exchanges designed to serve small businesses.\nOnly 11 SHOP exchanges have been implemented.\nAccording HealthSourceRI, by March 31 of this year the SHOP exchange had enrolled only about 1,800 people.\n\u201cI think that small businesses have more than enough to do dealing with customers to waste time trying to figure out how to navigate a SHOP exchange,\u201d said Graham."}
