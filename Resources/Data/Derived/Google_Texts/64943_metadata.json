Share your thoughts below.\n\nRob Portman gets a presidential plug. Ed FitzGerald, Matt Borges and Chris Redfern get the MSNBC treatment. And Frank Jackson goes to Washington. Here is today\u2019s Ohio Politics Roundup.\n\nThe best-equipped Republican candidate for president might be right under our noses in the Buckeye State, and he\u2019s not necessarily Gov. John Kasich. Or so argues Larry Sabato, the political scientist and prognosticator, in a new piece for Politico Magazine.\n\nU.S. Sen. Rob Portman \u2013 remember him? \u2013 was a vice-presidential prospect in 2012.\n\nThen, about a year ago, Portman came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage, revealing that his son, Will, is gay. The reversal brought increased scrutiny from social conservatives. But, at least in these parts, there was a sense that Portman\u2019s change of heart might be just what a GOP struggling with diversity needed to win 2016.\n\nSabato apparently agrees. He writes:\n\nBut what about another approach\u2014finding a nominee who doesn\u2019t just superficially demonstrate diversity but has taken a substantive, career-threatening position in standing up for diversity? Happy talk, campaign promises and speaking slots at national conventions are wholly inadequate if the goal is the remaking of the electorate. By contrast, a genuine profile in courage who has dramatically broken with GOP orthodoxy and demonstrated a capacity for growth can get the party a hearing, maybe more, with skeptical voters.\n\nEnter Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio. Portman attracted national attention in 2013 when he announced that his son, Will, an undergraduate student at Yale, was gay. Portman declared his support not just for his son but also for same-sex marriage. This happened before the key Supreme Court decision on gay marriage, and showed real family values, not the phony ones invoked by many politicians. Every political adviser on Portman\u2019s team must have warned him of the dangers: You could lose your seat in a primary, you\u2019ll be targeted by social conservatives, your national career will be over and your effectiveness even within the Senate will be circumscribed. It took guts to do what Portman did, with the political consequences unknown and potentially severe.\n\nBear in mind: Portman didn\u2019t even crack Sabato\u2019s latest Crystal Ball rankings of 2016 hopefuls, whereas Kasich was classified in the second tier and rising.\n\nFitzGerald watch\n\nNew limits on early voting continues to be a big political issue in this statewide election year \u2013 not just in Ohio, but also on MSNBC, which has long taken an interest in the topic.\n\nCuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald, the probable Democratic re-election challenger to Kasich this fall, appeared Monday evening on \u201cAll In with Chris Hayes.\u201d FitzGerald has called for new policy at the county level that would clash with new state laws and likely invite a legal fight with Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted.\n\nDemocrats believe restrictions on early voting, namely the elimination of evening and Sunday hours and new rules for mailing ballot requests, inconveniences working-class voters and minorities. Republicans stress a need for uniformity and cost controls.\n\nSaid FitzGerald on MSNBC: \u201cHow do you put a price tag on democracy?\u201d\n\nWatch the video:\n\n\n\n\n\nFitzGerald wasn\u2019t the only Ohioan to tackle the early voting issue Monday on MSNBC. Earlier, on \u201cRonan Farrow Daily,\u201d Ohio Republican Party Chairman Matt Borges and Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern argued their cases in separate interviews.\n\nHere\u2019s that segment:\n\n\n\n\n\nKasich watch\n\nA new ad by the Republican Governors Association is raising eyebrows in Ohio, writes Joe Vardon of the Columbus Dispatch. In South Carolina, the RGA is bashing Vincent Sheheen, the Democratic challenger to GOP incumbent Nikki Haley, for supporting Medicaid expansion under President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act.\n\nYep, that would be the same Medicaid expansion Kasich championed in Ohio.\n\nNo matter, for Kasich. Ohio\u2019s gubernatorial race remains in the \u201cLean Republican\u201d column for Louis Jacobson at Governing Magazine. Jacobson writes: \u201cKasich is benefiting from an improving economy and has won some crosspartisan plaudits for implementing a Medicaid expansion under Obamacare.\u201d\n\nConvention watch\n\nCleveland\u2019s business, civic and political leaders made their pitch Monday for the 2016 Republican National Convention. Mayor Frank Jackson led the delegation, reports Tom Beres of WKYC Channel 3.\n\nMeanwhile, movie star and former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is backing Columbus\u2019 bid, writes Jack Torry of the Dispatch.\n\nJaime Fuller of the Washington Post offers some tidbits on Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and the five non-Ohio cities vying for the GOP convention.\n\nAnd at his Smart Politics blog, University of Minnesota political scientist Eric Ostermeier explores the question of whether the GOP nominee can expect a boost in the convention\u2019s host state.\n\nDown-ballot: Mike DeWine and Josh Mandel\n\nTorry of the Dispatch reports on an unusual step taken by Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, who is arguing that a state elections law violates the First Amendment.\n\nAnd State Treasurer Josh Mandel is boasting of his office\u2019s third clean audit from State Auditor \u2013 and fellow Republican \u2013 Dave Yost.\n\nToday in 2006\n\nLee Fisher, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor on Ted Strickland\u2019s ticket, urges tougher penalties and other updates to hate crimes legislation he sponsored as a state senator.\n\n\u201cWe need to send a message in our society that when you commit a crime against someone because of the color of their skin or religion or ethnic heritage, you are not just committing a crime against that person,\" Fisher tells the Associated Press. \u201cYou are committing a crime against that entire community and society, and it deserves stiffer punishment.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "chris-redfern,early-voting,ed-fitzgerald,john-kasich,jon-husted,matt-borges,msnbc,ohio-politics-roundup,republican-national-convention,rob-portman", "title": "Some Rob Portman for president buzz and Ed FitzGerald on MSNBC: Ohio Politics Roundup", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Some Rob Portman for president buzz and Ed FitzGerald on MSNBC: Ohio Politics Roundup\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2014/03/some_rob_portman_for_president.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/open_impact/photo/14409277-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12349308\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-03-04T15:07:54Z\", \"author\": \"Henry J.
