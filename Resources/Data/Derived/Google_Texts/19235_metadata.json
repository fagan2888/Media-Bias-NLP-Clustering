But the price soon began to rise.\n\n\u201cBy 2008, it had jumped to $4,000 a month,\u201d she told Fred Hutch News Service last month. \u201cI thought this is crazy and then it jumped again. I had insurance but I started to get a lot of pushback.\u201d\n\nHavel was forced to use her credit cards to pay for her co-pays, out-of-pocket expenses, groceries and bills. Soon, she was in serious debt and forced to declare bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cPeople need to understand that this is a widespread problem,\u201d said Ramsey, a health economist who found cancer patients were two-and-a-half times more likely to declare bankruptcy. \u201cThis lets patients know they\u2019re not alone. The message to patients is that they shouldn\u2019t be ashamed if they\u2019re struggling with costs. It\u2019s a problem that really didn\u2019t exist 20 years ago. It\u2019s frankly due to rising costs of cancer care, a major one being the drug costs.\u201d\n\nPharmaceutical companies, however, have responded to favorable market incentives by continuing to raise their prices. According to the report, the average price of new cancer drugs has increased 5- to 10-fold over the last 15 years. A recent study found cancer drug prices had increased by an average of $8,500 per year over that period.\n\nPressure for progress\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all set up for them to charge whatever they want and they\u2019re just reacting,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cAnd the insurance industry in some ways is not completely blameless in this situation. The whole thing is just a mess. Insurance companies aren\u2019t behaving well. Pharma\u2019s not behaving well.\u201d\n\nProgress, he said, will require patients and others to put pressure on the federal government to change laws.\n\nThe report offers a number of recommendations that would \u201callow market forces to work better.\u201d They include a new process that considers value to patients and health care when proposing fair prices for new treatments, permitting Medicare to negotiate prices, allowing cancer drugs to be imported across U.S. borders from countries \u2014 such as Canada \u2014 where drugs are significantly cheaper, and more.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, cancer drugs are not truly sold in a free market,\u201d said Janet Freeman-Daily, a 59-year-old metastatic lung cancer patient from Seattle. \u201cWe have willing sellers but the buyers are under the gun. Allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices seems like a reasonable first step to fixing this problem.\u201d\n\nHavel said the current system was flawed in so many ways, it was difficult to pinpoint how to fix it.\n\n\u201cIs Big Pharma the issue? Insurance companies? Hospitals? The cost of medical school in this country?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt seems like when we go after one problem \u2014 insurance companies for example with the [Affordable Care Act] \u2014 another loophole is found to mess things up in a different way. It's good that Americans thrive on ingenuity, but when there is a lack of compassion and health care is treated the same way as selling cable television, there's a problem.\"\n\nCaught in the crossfire\n\nGrassroots movements like the one that prompted a recent Change.org petition advocating against the high price of cancer drugs are one way cancer patients can make their voices heard, the report pointed out.\n\n\u201cWith proper support of these grassroots efforts \u2026 it should be possible to focus the attention of pharmaceutical companies on this problem and to encourage our elected representatives to more effectively advocate for the interests of their most important constituents among the stakeholders in cancer \u2014 American cancer patients,\u201d it concludes.\n\nHICOR\u2019s Ramsey said he was \u201cvery sympathetic\u201d for the patients and families caught in the middle, especially since they\u2019re already facing major physical, emotional and psychological challenges.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re caught in the crossfire of all of this and it\u2019s the last thing [they] should have to deal with,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also sees a role for patients \u2014 and their loved ones \u2014 in changing policy.\n\n\u201cI do think there\u2019s a role for patients in speaking with their cancer care providers about this problem and for being more proactive,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd if patients are too sick to advocate for themselves?\n\n\u201cCancer touches one in three Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you count the friends and family members of these patients, that\u2019s a pretty big constituency.\u201d\n\nHave you been affected by the high costs of cancer care?
