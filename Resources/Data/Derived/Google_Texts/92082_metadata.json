The bill would cut the minimum wage for workers who make at least $4 an hour in tips, to Save Jobs, and also maybe because the state\u2019s restaurant industry lobbied heavily for the bill. To save jobs, dontcha know. Then they probably made a Hillary-at-Chipotle joke, which is all the rage with Republicans these days.\n\nThe bill\u2019s author, Rep. Pat Garofalo, said the lower minimum wage for tipped workers was absolutely necessary to keep restaurants from closing when the state\u2019s overall minimum wage increases to $9.50/hr in 2016, claiming that restaurants and bars would simply be forced out of business if they had to pay their employees the same as other workers. Never mind the abundant evidence that minimum wage increases don\u2019t actually result in job losses; if employers believe it and tell Republicans that it will cause job losses, then by golly, it sure will (see once again the popular rightwing myth about Seattle restaurants closing after a minimum-wage increase \u2014 it\u2019s a fine talking point, except for how it simply isn\u2019t true).\n\nRep. Tim Mahoney, from the Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor party (we just love the full name) called the bill what it is: class warfare. He pointed out that over 8,000 working mothers in the state would suffer a wage cut if the bill became law:\n\n\u201cThe message from this bill is that you\u2019re making too much money,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wants to keep people making $12 per hour rather than making $14 or $15 an hour. If you tried living on $30,000 per year in this state, you\u2019d understand that a couple of thousand dollars per year makes a huge difference.\u201d\n\nAnd just to add a little extra awfulness to the mix, the House bill would also prohibit municipalities and other local entities, like airport authorities, from setting a minimum wage higher than the state minimum wage. When you\u2019re cribbing ideas from Maine\u2019s Gov. Paul LePage, you\u2019re really scraping the bottom of the barrel (or you\u2019ve got a friend in ALEC).\n\nAlso, since they were on a roll, House Republicans crammed a whole bunch of other crap into the bill, a shit souffl\u00e9 in which the minimum wage provisions were only the most notable chunks:\n\nThe bill also was packed with other controversial provisions, especially related to energy. It would end certain conservation and renewable-energy programs, including greenhouse-gas-reduction goals; repeal the moratorium on new nuclear plants, and rescind the ban on importation of coal-fired power.\n\nSomewhere in the Republican caucus, someone undoubtedly added, \u201cThat\u2019s it then. Cancel the kitchen scraps for lepers and orphans, no more merciful beheadings, and call off Christmas.\u201d It was one of those kinds of days.\n\nHappily, since Minnesota\u2019s government has so far escaped Full Wisconization, the bill is unlikely to go anywhere in the DFL-controlled state Senate, and even if it passed there, would almost certainly be vetoed by Gov. Mark Dayton, who not incidentally supports a $10 minimum wage for airport workers. Still, it\u2019s nice to see that Minnesota Republicans have adopted the favorite hobby of their brothers in the U.S. House, and are determined to pass any number of crazy things that are destined to never become law. We bet if you looked into the bill far enough, you\u2019d find subsections banning funding for ACORN and repealing Obamacare, too.\n\n[Minneapolis Star Tribune via RawStory]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Republican-controlled Minnesota House of Representatives passed a nice fuck-the-poors bill Wednesday.\u00a0The bill would cut the minimum wage for workers who", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Doktor Zoom", "og": {"url": "http://wonkette.com/583743/minnesota-republicans-solve-pressing-problem-of-waitresses-making-too-much-money", "image": "http://img.wonkette.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Alice-Doesnt-Live-Here-Anymore.png", "title": "Minnesota Republicans Solve Pressing Problem Of Waitresses Making Too Much Money"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Republican-controlled Minnesota House of Representatives passed a nice fuck-the-poors bill Wednesday \u2026", "creator": "@wonkette", "url": "http://wonkette.com/583743/minnesota-republicans-solve-pressing-problem-of-waitresses-making-too-much-money", "image": "http://img.wonkette.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Alice-Doesnt-Live-Here-Anymore.png", "title": "Minnesota Republicans Solve Pressing Problem Of Waitresses Making Too Much Money", "site": "@wonkette", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0ad9\"", "article_summary": "The Republican-controlled Minnesota House of Representatives passed a nice fuck-the-poors bill Wednesday.\nMark Dayton, who not incidentally supports a $10 minimum wage for airport workers.\nThen they probably made a Hillary-at-Chipotle joke, which is all the rage with Republicans these days.\n\u201cIt wants to keep people making $12 per hour rather than making $14 or $15 an hour.\nStill, it\u2019s nice to see that Minnesota Republicans have adopted the favorite hobby of their brothers in the U.S. House, and are determined to pass any number of crazy things that are destined to never become law."}
