Total employment for Postal Service clerks will drop by 32 percent by 2022, BLS predicted, marking the largest decrease, followed by Postal Service mail sorters, processors, processing machine operators and mail carriers.\n\nIn total, Postal Service jobs will decline 28 percent by 2022 -- a reduction of more than 139,000 jobs. That analysis was based on 2012 data, when USPS employed 491,600 employees.\n\nThe Postal Service has aggressively used buyout and early retirement incentives to reduce its workforce during the last several years as part of a larger effort to better align its network with declining mail volumes. It shed 37,400 jobs in fiscal 2013 alone, and has cut more than 200,000 jobs in the last several years. Most of the cuts that BLS anticipated may come sooner rather than later; Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe has said he plans to shed an additional 100,000 jobs by 2017. At that point, the agency hopes to once again begin hiring.\n\nUSPS Wants More Time to Deliver Mail\n\nIn other Postal Service news, the agency has asked its regulatory body to allow USPS to alter the delivery schedule for most standard mail.\n\nThe change would apply to bulk mailings, which currently gets bottlenecked at the beginning of each week. Mail dropped off at post offices in cities that require more than one ZIP code on Thursday or Friday currently is delivered on Monday, while mail dropped off on Saturday is delivered on Tuesday.\n\nThe proposal would keep the Monday delivery day for mail dropped off on Thursday. But mail dropped off on Friday at such post offices would be delivered on Tuesday, while the Postal Service would deliver Saturday drop-offs on Wednesday.\n\nWhile an individual mailer dropping off a postcard may not be affected by this proposal, most large mailers would feel the delay. The revised delivery schedule would impact about 32 percent of overall mail, or 62 percent of standard mail.\n\nThe Postal Service called its plan \u201cload leveling,\u201d saying it would create \u201ca more even distribution of mail volume delivered throughout the week.\u201d\n\nIn its obligatory request to the Postal Regulatory Commission, USPS attorneys said the agency \u201cdetermined that it is necessary to take steps to level the load on the network now to help reduce current and future costs.\u201d\n\nThe proposal comes as a double-whammy for the Postal Service\u2019s biggest customers, who were infuriated by the recent decision to raise postal rates more than the standard inflationary amount.\n\nMore from Government Executive:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Jobs at the U.S.", "title": "Postal Service Sheds Jobs As Delivery Slows", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/14/Postal-Service-Sheds-Jobs-Delivery-Slows", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03222013_mailbox_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/01/14/Postal-Service-Sheds-Jobs-Delivery-Slows", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03222013_mailbox_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Jobs at the U.S.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca473\"", "article_summary": "Total employment for Postal Service clerks will drop by 32 percent by 2022, BLS predicted, marking the largest decrease, followed by Postal Service mail sorters, processors, processing machine operators and mail carriers.\nIn total, Postal Service jobs will decline 28 percent by 2022 -- a reduction of more than 139,000 jobs.\nThe revised delivery schedule would impact about 32 percent of overall mail, or 62 percent of standard mail.\nPostal Service will disappear at a faster clip over the next eight years than in any other labor sector, according to an analysis from the Labor Department.\nBut mail dropped off on Friday at such post offices would be delivered on Tuesday, while the Postal Service would deliver Saturday drop-offs on Wednesday."}
