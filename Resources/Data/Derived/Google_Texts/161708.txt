This week, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences unveiled the nominees for the 86thAcademy Awards. And it occurred to us that unlike most other industries, the tech sector and its media, for whatever reason, has a long and storied history of "celebritizing" many of its most influential CEOs and pundits.

We know a lot about tech CEOs, especially compared to chieftains from other industries.

After all, we don't know if Mike Duke is into cupcakes or whether or not Inge Thulin is an avid sailor, right? Most people probably wouldn't be able to pick David Lesar out of a lineup of five middle-aged white guys â€“ even if you spotted them four guesses. Zuckerberg? Ballmer? Mayer? These are household faces and backstories.

In this light, perhaps it makes perfect sense that the daughter of one of the most famous and impactful icons in the tech industry would play a key role in getting some of this year's most decorated films made.

We didn't have time or space to include all the "Best Picture" nominees, but feel free to add your own in the comments section.

The envelopes, please:
