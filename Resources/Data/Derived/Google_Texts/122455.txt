Bundle up, but not too tightly.

While temperatures will struggle to break the freezing mark this week in Denver, no cold temperature extremes will likely be reached.

“We have to get in the minus teens to get in the record books,” said Kyle Fredin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boulder.

Through the end of the year, temperatures are expected to top out in the mid-20s to low-30s with little precipitation expected, Fredin said Sunday morning. Nighttime lows will be in the single digits, including a 10-degree low predicted for New Year’s Eve.

That, Fredin said, compares favorably to the 19 degrees below zero the Front Range experienced this week last year.

The best chance of breaking the freezing mark comes Monday, when temperatures flirt with the mid-30s, Fredin said. Sunday will be sunny and cold, with temperatures stuck in the 20s.

High temps for Denver average 42 degrees this time of year, he said.

Fredin said the Front Range can expect the last five days of the year to be sunny to partly cloudy. A slight warming trend is expected as 2016 dawns on Friday.

Light snow may come to the mountains on Tuesday and Wednesday.
