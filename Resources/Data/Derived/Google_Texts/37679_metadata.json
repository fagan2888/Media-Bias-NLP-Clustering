Now, financial analysts say the shutdown could also worsen the nation\u2019s deficit.\n\nThis year, the deficit was expected to shrink to its smallest shortfall since before the recession. However, as a new Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research Report explains, the loss of tax revenue from the masses of furloughed workers, coupled with the cost for agencies to implement the shutdown, will likely \u201cput upside risk\u201d on the budget deficit. The analysts warn:\n\nInside the Beltway this may look like a \u2018zero-sum game\u2019 where one party\u2019s win is the other party\u2019s loss. However, outside the Beltway, we believe this is very much a negative-sum game: the odds of a major shock to the economy and a full-blown correction to the stock market have risen. Ironically, we think this also puts upside risk to the budget deficit \u2013 due to shutdown costs and reduced revenues \u2013 and it does not slow implementation of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 it is funded outside of the appropriations process.\n\nOn top of this likely damage, the shutdown could reduce GDP growth by 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter and cost the economy $55 billion if it lasts three to four weeks.\n\nTo re-open the government, self-professed Republican budget hawks are pushing for the repeal of Obamacare\u2019s medical device tax, which would add about $35 billion to the national debt. The last Congressional crisis, over sequestration, resulted in an estimated $4.5 billion in lost revenue, not to mention stagnating consumer spending due to mass furloughs.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Adding to the shutdown's economic damage, analysts now say the Congressional impasse could hurt deficit reduction, too.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Adding to the shutdown's economic damage, analysts now say the Congressional impasse could hurt deficit reduction, too.", "title": "The Government Shutdown Will Probably Increase The Deficit", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/10/02/2715591/shutdown-deficit/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AP638426409553.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Adding to the shutdown's economic damage, analysts now say the Congressional impasse could hurt deficit reduction, too.", "creator": "@avivash", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AP638426409553-321x214.jpg", "title": "The Government Shutdown Will Probably Increase The Deficit", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-economy", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AP638426409553.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/AP638426409553.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-02T09:24:50+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/avivawshen"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc34a\"", "article_summary": "Economy The Government Shutdown Will Probably Increase The Deficit CREDIT: APCREDIT: APThe economic cost of Congress\u2019 failure to avert a shutdown is quickly mounting, to the tune of $300 million a day.\nNow, financial analysts say the shutdown could also worsen the nation\u2019s deficit.\nIronically, we think this also puts upside risk to the budget deficit \u2013 due to shutdown costs and reduced revenues \u2013 and it does not slow implementation of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 it is funded outside of the appropriations process.\nThis year, the deficit was expected to shrink to its smallest shortfall since before the recession.\nHowever, as a new Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research Report explains, the loss of tax revenue from the masses of furloughed workers, coupled with the cost for agencies to implement the shutdown, will likely \u201cput upside risk\u201d on the budget deficit."}
