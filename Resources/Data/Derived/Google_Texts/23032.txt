In his Feb. 1 letter [Turn focus to 2016's election for senate], Bob Bernard is right in professing the accomplishments of State Sen. Rob Hogg, but let’s go a little further. Hogg will be running against Sen. Charles Grassley, a multi-term senator who should be the poster child for term limits.

Grassley was on the Gang of Eight a few years back, charged with coming up with ideas for immigration reform. He came back to Iowa for town hall meetings and regurgitated Sarah Palin comments about “throwing grandma under the bus,” with regard to the Affordable Care Act. And Sen. Grassley stood firm with his Republican colleagues and supported Ted Cruz when the government was shut down over funding issues a few years ago. State Sen. Hogg would be a great replacement for our long-time sitting senator.
