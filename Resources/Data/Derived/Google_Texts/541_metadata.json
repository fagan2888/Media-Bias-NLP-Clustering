find new way to identify embryos that will implant in the womb\n\nEach year in Britain, clinics carry out about 60,000 IVF treatments\n\nMany couples remain childless because embryo fails to implant in womb\n\nMost IVF clinics had success rates of 20-30 per cent of women having a baby after treatment.\n\nFertility scientists have found a new way to identify embryos that will implant in the womb which could boost IVF success rates by up to 50 per cent.\n\nThe presence of high levels of DNA from energy-producing cells in the embryo is a signal that it will fail to implant and produce a pregnancy, according to researchers from Oxford University.\n\nThey found a threshold, or cut-off point, below which embryos could be guaranteed to implant, and above which some failed to do so.\n\nThe Oxford group investigated whether the amount of mitochondrial DNA found in early-stage embryos analysed in the laboratory affected the chances of it implanting after transfer to the womb\n\nEach year in Britain, clinics carry out about 60,000 IVF treatments but many couples remain childless, often because the embryo fails to implant in the womb.\n\nThis can occur if the embryo is carrying genetic defects, or even if it appears to be healthy.\n\nIt is thought the new finding may explain around one in three implantation failures.\n\nResearch scientist Dr Elpida Fragouli, of the Nuffield Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Oxford, and Reprogenetics UK, a specialist group of fertility scientists, said the discovery meant it could be a \u2018new independent biomarker of embryo viability\u2019, helping doctors to choose the embryos most likely to result in pregnancy.\n\nShe said most IVF clinics had success rates of 20-30 per cent of women having a baby after treatment.\n\nEach year in Britain, clinics carry out about 60,000 IVF treatments but many couples remain childless, often because the embryo fails to implant in the womb (file photo)\n\nThis figure could rise to 40 per cent after pre-implantation genetic screening of the egg or embryo for chromosome abnormalities that are a major cause of miscarriages and conditions such as Down syndrome.\n\nShe said \u2018We believe that adding this biomarker to the process will increase those rates to 50 or 60 per cent.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s very easy to do, it only takes a couple of hours, and although we haven\u2019t worked out a price yet it will be very cheap, just a few pounds.\u2019\n\nShe said four or five clinics in the UK and Spain were already using the technique free as part of their screening in return for data that could lead to commercial development of a test.\n\nStudies into the technique have not yet been published in a scientific journal but were presented for the first time at the Annual Meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) in Munich.\n\nThe Oxford group investigated whether the amount of mitochondrial DNA found in early-stage embryos analysed in the laboratory affected the chances of it implanting after transfer to the womb.\n\nMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is genetic material found in the tiny power packs of the cells, or mitochondria, which is contributed by the woman.\n\nThe team of international experts led by Dr Fragouli took biopsies from 392 embryos at the five day stage of development when mtDNA levels start rising, generated by couples at eight clinics.\n\nThey also looked at 87 women aged around 38 where the embryo was transferred to the womb, resulting in 44 pregnancies and 48 failures to implant.\n\nThe findings showed high levels of mtDNA in embryos carrying genetic defects and those from older women, especially those over 40.\n\nThe team found healthy embryos capable of implanting in the womb tended to have lower levels of mtDNA than those failing to implant.\n\nMost importantly, they could establish a threshold of mtDNA quantity below which implantation was certain.\n\nAltogether 30 per cent of healthy embryos that failed to implant had quantities of mtDNA above this threshold, while 100 per cent of healthy embryos that produced a pregnancy had levels below it.\n\nDr Fragouli said it was not clear why high levels of mtDNA should affect implantation, although they are a sign that the embryo may be under stress.", "article_metadata": {"Rating":
