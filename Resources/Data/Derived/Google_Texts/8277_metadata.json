We are also seeing a reduction of our cow herd,\u201d lamented California Cattlemen\u2019s Association executive director Billy Gatlin.\n\nAbout 150,000 of the 600,000 breeding cows in California have been sold off this year, Gatlin said. Some ranchers are shipping in hay to keep their animals alive, but the strategy is unsustainable and expected to trigger another selling wave this summer.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t afford to feed your way out of a drought,\u201d Gatlin said.\n\nNearly 57,000 cattle \u2014 a combination of dairy and beef \u2014 have entered Colorado this year from California, compared with 28,980 in the first four months of last year, according to statistics from the state Department of Agriculture, which provides health checks to incoming livestock.\n\n\u201cThey have been going mainly to Texas and Nevada, and I am sure they will be coming here as well,\u201d Chris Shelley, an agent with the CSU Extension office in Wray, said of the California livestock.\n\nWhile California cattle heading to slaughter regularly make their way to Colorado, this year is different in that a lot of cows are also coming into the state.\n\n\u201cWe are short on females here. People are trying to replace them,\u201d said Bill Martin, owner of the Western Slope Cattlemen\u2019s Livestock Auction in Loma.\n\nMartin, who also raises cattle, said prices were lower from January to March as California ranchers unloaded cows. But prices have since spiked as more ranchers clamor for breeding stock.\n\n\u201cAnybody who has had rain is going to California to get cows,\u201d he said.\n\nMartin said California steers and heifers coming into the state, typically weighing 700 to 800 pounds, are running closer to 500 to 600 pounds because of the difficult conditions.\n\nCattle in California\u2019s Central Valley traditionally feed locally until the grasses dry out in April or May. They then move to greener pastures in the state\u2019s northern mountains or are sold to buyers farther east for fattening.\n\nThis year, grass in the Central Valley dried up by February and March, forcing cattle owners to take desperate measures. Today, all of California is experiencing extreme or exceptional drought conditions, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nOne solution for suffering cattle owners is to lease greener pastures in wetter states. But Colorado ranchers and those who work with them say they would prefer to hang onto every blade of grass.\n\nCSU Extension officials in several counties said they weren\u2019t aware of landowners leasing pasture to California ranchers.\n\n\u201cWe are coming out of our own drought, and there is not an awful lot of capacity in either stored feed or pasture,\u201d said Keith Maxey, director of the CSU Extension office in Weld County.\n\nMore moisture in the fall and winter made it feel like relief was finally around the corner, but a drier and windy spring have revived old worries, Nunn rancher Ray Peterson said.\n\nA drought-driven grass shortage forced him to cull his herd three years ago from 190 to fewer than 120. He would like to get back to around 200 but is waiting.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t taken any new cattle,\u201d said Peterson. \u201cGiven the weather conditions we are facing right now, I am hoping to hold on to the ones I have.\u201d\n\nGrass \u2014 or the lack of it \u2014 will determine who can profit as the U.S. cattle herd rebounds from a six-decade low.\n\n\u201cHigh beef prices are an incentive to rebuild, if you have grass,\u201d said Gene Manuello, a cow-calf producer in Sterling. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have any grass, you can\u2019t rebuild.\u201d\n\nSoutheastern Colorado continues to face severe drought conditions, while the dominance of public lands in the Western half of the state limits grazing by out-of-state cattle.\n\nIn the San Luis Valley, heavier snows have provided a mixed blessing, providing much-needed moisture but also killing off calves.\n\nAbout 18 inches of snow covered the ground before Thanksgiving and didn\u2019t depart until late February, said Don Shawcroft, a partner in John B Shawcroft Ranches, based in Alamosa.\n\n\u201cWe are just hoping to recover from what we lost this year,\u201d he said.\n\nRanchers in Routt County, known for its alpine grass, take on a large number of yearling steers and heifers from California, but they can\u2019t exceed the usual pace by too much.\n\nRanchers know better than to take on more cattle than the land can safely feed, said Todd Hagenbuch, with the CSU Extension office in Steamboat Springs.\n\nConsumers can expect beef prices to remain high, based on strong export markets and given the severity of the drought in California, Texas and other states, said Kevin Good, senior marketing analyst with CattleFax in Centennial.\n\n\u201cSupplies of beef are tight, supplies of pork are tight and poultry supplies have been stymied over the last six or seven years,\u201d he said.\n\nAldo Svaldi: 303-954-1410, asvaldi@denverpost.com or twitter.com/aldosvaldi", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "California cattle, short on food, finding way to Colorado", "title": "California cattle, short on food, finding way to Colorado", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/15/california-cattle-short-on-food-finding-way-to-colorado/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140515__20140516_A1_BZ16CALICOWSp1.jpg", "height": 432}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140515__20140516_A1_BZ16CALICOWSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-15T21:20:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T17:33:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9a4b\"", "article_summary": "CSU Extension officials in several counties said they weren\u2019t aware of landowners leasing pasture to California ranchers.\nMartin, who also raises cattle, said prices were lower from January to March as California ranchers unloaded cows.\nCalifornia ranchers, despite near-record beef prices, are culling their cattle herds in response to one of the most severe droughts that state has ever faced.\nBut Colorado ranchers and those who work with them say they would prefer to hang onto every blade of grass.\nWhile California cattle heading to slaughter regularly make their way to Colorado, this year is different in that a lot of cows are also coming into the state."}
