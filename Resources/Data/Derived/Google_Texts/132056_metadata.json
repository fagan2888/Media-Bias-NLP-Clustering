Out-of-pocket maximums will increase $1,500 for single and $3,000 for a family.\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re barely managing some of our medical bills. They come at us every month with my daughter\u2019s (health) condition,\u201d said Putnam County teacher Rachelle Williams who spoke tearfully of her struggle at the hearing. \u201cIf the rates were to increase the way that they talk about, we could potentially have to move. Right now the cuts that they\u2019re proposing will financially destroy us.\u201d\n\nTeachers and retirees in the program made up a large portion of the crowd. Brian Lauck from Logan County Middle School said he comes from a family of teachers who say he should leave the state.\n\n\u201cI have family members who are teachers; about 15 of them. They all said I was an idiot for coming to West Virginia because of the pay, and because the insurance prices going up is going to affect that further,\u201d Lauck said.\n\nRetired college professor Joe Badgley had a few suggestions for taxes that could help fund the PEIA, which he presented during his speech.\n\n\u201cA modest increase in the tobacco tax would keep the merchants in West Virginia competitive with their contiguous states and bring in millions of dollars to fund PEIA,\u201d he explained. \u201cIncreasing the pop tax that was initiated in 1951 would bring in a significant amount of revenue that should be dedicated to fund PEIA.\u201d\n\nJoe White, Executive Director of the West Virginia School Service Personnel Association, said the legislature needs to make more a commitment to fund the PEIA.\n\n\u201cIt is the legislature\u2019s responsibility to make sure that PEIA is funded,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can find funding for just about anything else that they want to fund, and it is their job to fund that.\u201d\n\nThe plan will be up for final approval before the finance board next month. Tuesday night\u2019s hearing was the PEIA board\u2019s fourth after meetings in Morgantown, Wheeling and Martinsburg.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hundreds show up at Charleston Civic to express disapproval with possible insurance cost increases.", "og": {"site_name": "WV MetroNews", "description": "Hundreds show up at Charleston Civic to express disapproval with possible insurance cost increases.", "title": "PEIA Charleston hearing sees large disgruntled crowd", "url": "http://wvmetronews.com/2015/11/10/peia-charleston-hearing-sees-large-disgruntled-crowd/", "image": {"width": 1632, "identifier": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/peia.jpg", "height": 1224}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://wvmetronews.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/peia.jpg?w=640", "site": "@wvmetronews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 439959236158130, "pages": 327490709044}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-11T02:16:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-11T02:16:12+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "In a $120 million hole, the PEIA is proposing a $500 increase for workers on an individual plan and $1,000 for those with a family plan.\nTuesday night\u2019s hearing was the PEIA board\u2019s fourth after meetings in Morgantown, Wheeling and Martinsburg.\nRetired college professor Joe Badgley had a few suggestions for taxes that could help fund the PEIA, which he presented during his speech.\n\u201cA modest increase in the tobacco tax would keep the merchants in West Virginia competitive with their contiguous states and bring in millions of dollars to fund PEIA,\u201d he explained.\nBrian Lauck from Logan County Middle School said he comes from a family of teachers who say he should leave the state."}
