They enjoy certain locked-in advantages. The party itself is united and wholly organized around the idea of winning. (There is, however, a sense that its best talents have been exhausted in the two Obama terms, and its rising talents haven\u2019t had the chance to learn what losers know.) Mrs. Clinton has 100% name ID, has one opponent in an old socialist to whom she can be publicly kind, and is connected to a former president whose presidency is looked back on with a sort of encrusted nostalgia\u2014good economy, relative peace, colorful and singular messes. She has lasted long enough to go from wide-shouldered yuppie with angry blond hair to cooing grandmother. Soon they\u2019ll be calling her \u201cMami.\u201d The polls show that even at this low point in her campaign, with the daily scandal cascade, she continues to beat all GOP comers. This week\u2019s Quinnipiac survey shows her leading the closest Republican challengers, Rand Paul (46% to 42%) and Marco Rubio (45% to 41%). Republicans take comfort that this world-famous, unopposed icon is under 50%. I\u2019m not so sure.\n\nShe\u2019s an icon who lacks iconic qualities apart from the globally famous brand that is her surname. That\u2019s what makes the pantsuit tee so goofy. It\u2019s an attempt to personalize the appeal of someone whose appeal is emphatically impersonal. It\u2019d be like making a t-shirt for Coca-Cola with the CEO\u2019s face on the front instead of the Coke trademark. Obama\u2019s cult of personality really was a cult of personality; there was more to it than just his personal charisma, like hopes for racial redemption in electing the first black president, but the \u201ccelebrity\u201d knock on O resonated because he really did seem like a celebrity. He was young, good-looking, exquisitely poised in front of the camera, and charming to pretty much everyone outside the righty base. Obama\u2019s celebrity built the Obama brand. With Hillary, the opposite is true \u2014 the Clinton brand built Hillary\u2019s celebrity. Her only compelling personal quality is her First! Woman! President! narrative, which the pantsuit tee alludes to but only indirectly in playing up her supposed status as a personal icon. If she wants to push the gender angle, she\u2019d be better off with a slogan (\u201cIt\u2019s Time\u201d) and her corporate logo than with anything that alludes to her as an individual. Hillary the person is a terrible candidate, arguably unelectable. Hillary the product, though? Money.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Nope.", "title": "I guess we need to talk about the Podesta photo", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/05/29/i-guess-we-need-to-talk-about-the-podesta-photo/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-29T19:21:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-29T18:34:57+00:00"}, "keywords": "hillary, Jim Messina, John Podesta, pantsuit, t-shirt,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfcd7\"", "article_summary": "narrative, which the pantsuit tee alludes to but only indirectly in playing up her supposed status as a personal icon.\nI guess we need to talk about the Podesta photoposted at 3:21 pm on May 29, 2015 by AllahpunditAs usual, I agree with Gabe Malor.\nIf they wanted a lesbian to model the pantsuit tee, why not ask a lesbian?\nIf you needed to sum up the coolness disparity between Obama\u2019s cult of personality and Hillary\u2019s in one photo, this would be it.\nThat\u2019s what makes the pantsuit tee so goofy."}
