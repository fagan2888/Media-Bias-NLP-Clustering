A new traffic pattern on Oct. 12, 2015, shifted lanes on US 17/74/76 between Leland and Wilmington to the left as work continues to widen the bridge over Alligator Creek.

BRUNSWICK COUNTY, NC (WWAY) — Drivers heading from Brunswick County into Wilmington found a new lane pattern on the Wilmington Causeway this morning.

After cross over the Brunswick River, lanes shift to the left and continue over a new bridge across Alligator Creek. It’s the latest update on the continuing project, which should finish up next year.

The shift will allow crews to finish widening the eastbound bridge over Alligator Creek.
