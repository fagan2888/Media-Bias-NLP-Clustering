That someone I've never met, it just...I couldn't believe it,\" said Rev. Carole Murphrey, Executive Director.\n\nThe Good Samaritan Rescue Mission has been in dire need of donations to get back money spent on required renovations after Code Enforcement gave the shelter several violations last summer. Since then the homeless shelter has spent $100,000 from its operations budget to meet code standards, which has put them $45,000 in debt.\n\nYet now staff have hope that they will not need to close their doors to the 200 homeless they provide beds for.\n\n\"The money that we do get right now is simply to get us back to zero. To get back to where we can pay our light bills, pay things like food and so forth,\" said Rafael Ortiz III, Program Director.\n\nThe renovation costs were unanticipated, and that paired with unexpected costs for employee benefits brought by the Affordable Care Act forced the shelter to make cuts.\n\n\"I've laid off 8 staff members, which I really hated to do because they were people that were formally homeless,\" Ortiz said. \"We've had our coffeehouse. We've had to shut that down as well because of operating costs. And so we're making cuts to assist ourselves with it.\"\n\nStaff have new confidence now that the shelter is out of debt.\n\n\"I know that we're going to be able to pay up the bills and we're going to be okay at the end of this month,\" Rev. Murphrey said.\n\nHowever there are next month's costs, and donations remain down compared to previous years.\n\n\"We've had a lot of older loyal people that have passed away. Or because of the fact that the oil shortage is hitting a lot of businesses that normally gave to Good Samaritan,\" Ortiz said.\n\nThe shelter has a $1.6 million annual budget. They hope for $15,000 in donations monthly to maintain that.\n\nGood Samaritan has also repaired major code violations, and is working with Code Enforcement to resolve any remaining problems.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The homeless shelter went into debt after paying for renovations to meet code standards.", "author": "Jane Caffrey", "og": {"url": "http://www.kristv.com/story/31478883/major-donation-keeps-good-samaritan-from-closing-doors", "image": "http://KRIS.images.worldnow.com/images/10108124_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The homeless shelter went into debt after paying for renovations to meet code standards.", "title": "Major donation keeps Good Samaritan from closing doors"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KRIS.images.worldnow.com/images/10108124_G.jpg", "title": "Major donation keeps Good Samaritan from closing doors", "description": "The homeless shelter went into debt after paying for renovations to meet code standards.", "card": "summary", "creator": "https://twitter.com/janecaffrey"}, "wnreadableurl": "major-donation-keeps-good-samaritan-from-closing-doors", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KRIS", "fb": {"app_id": 175208089205670}, "date": "2016/03/15", "article": {"author": "https://facebook.com/jane.caffrey"}, "KEYWORDS": "continuous news, breaking news, Corpus Christi, sports, weather", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS28", "news_keywords": "continuous news, breaking news, Corpus Christi, sports, weather"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5d39\"", "article_summary": "Or because of the fact that the oil shortage is hitting a lot of businesses that normally gave to Good Samaritan,\" Ortiz said.\nGood Samaritan has also repaired major code violations, and is working with Code Enforcement to resolve any remaining problems.\nStaff feared Good Samaritan would need to close until a donor gave $45,000 to get the shelter out of debt.\nFears that The Good Samaritan Rescue Mission might need to close its doors by the end of this month were quelled today, when an anonymous donor contributed $45,000 to the shelter's budget.\nSince then the homeless shelter has spent $100,000 from its operations budget to meet code standards, which has put them $45,000 in debt."}
