DE PERE - If the Steven Avery case is ever finally decided, you’ll be able to print the paper on a post card.

If the goal of “Making A Murderer” was to get a lot of notoriety and make a lot of money, they have accomplished their goals. They’ve shown that everyone is guilty except the murderers. If you interview any of the prisoners at the Green Bay Correctional Institution, you will discover that just about everyone there is not guilty of the crime they are incarcerated for. They were framed, or are the victim of circumstances or their upbringing or environment or abuse.

I believe the law says a person should get a fair trial, not a perfect trial. In dealing with people, none are perfect. Monday morning quarterbacks are in abundance.

I do not believe the people on the jury that convicted Avery and Brendan Dassey are stupid people. They looked at all of the facts and decided on a verdict — guilty. Why not just accept their decision.
