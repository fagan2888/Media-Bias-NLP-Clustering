WASHINGTON, DC – It’s nice to know that there can be fun in Congress, and not only partisan wrangling.

The U.S. Senators from Oregon are betting their colleagues from Ohio on the big college football game, with the winners of the bet to collect their due on the steps of the U.S. Capitol.

The national championship game Monday night between Ohio State and Oregon will also be a contest between Oregon’s U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley on one side and Ohio’s U.S. Senators Sherrod Brown and Rob Portman on the other. Wyden, Merkley and Brown are Democrats. Portman is a Republican

“If Oregon beats Ohio State on Jan. 12, Senators Brown and Portman have agreed to learn how to “throw the O” sign with instructions from their Oregon colleagues and from the Oregon Duck if and when the Ducks visit Washington, DC as national champions,” Wyden said

On the other hand, if Ohio State defeats Oregon, Senators Wyden and Merkley have agreed to help their Ohio colleagues spell “O-H-I-O.”

“We make this wager in full confidence that Oregon will win Monday night with its high-octane offense led by Heisman winner Marcus Mariota and its swarming, ball-hawking defense,” Wyden and Merkley said. “And we of course look forward to showing our friends from Ohio how to make the universal symbol for Ducks’ dominance.

“As a proud alum of The Ohio State University – I look forward to watching the Buckeyes bring home the first ever college football playoff championship,” Brown said. “The waterfowl of Eugene will put up a strong and respectable effort but will ultimately migrate back to Oregon empty handed. I accept Sens. Wyden and Merkley’s wager and look forward to helping them spell out the name of our great state after the game. Go Bucks!”

United States Senate

LIQUID NATURAL GAS — U.S. Senator Michael Bennet (D-Colorado) has joined Senators John Barrasso (R-Wyoming) and Martin Heinrich (D-New Mexico) to introduce the LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act. The bipartisan bill would speed up the approval process for exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to countries which do not have free trade agreements with the United States. Prior to approving applications to export natural gas to countries which do not have free trade agreements with the United States, the Secretary of Energy must make a public interest determination which includes a public comment period. The LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act specifically requires a decision on any LNG export application within 45 days after the environmental review document for the project is published.

PETRAEUS PROSECUTION –U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California), on CNN’s “State of the Union” program on Sunday, Jan. 11, said former CIA Director General David Petraeus has “suffered enough” in the wake of the discovery that he allegedly leaked classified documents to Paula Broadwell, his mistress and biographer. “People aren’t perfect. He made a mistake. He lost his job as CIA director because of it. I mean, how much do you want to punish somebody? It’s done. It’s over. He’s retired. He’s lost his job. How much does [the] government want?” She responded to a question about the U.S. Justice Department considering bringing more charges against Petraeus.

BOOKER SWEARING-IN — Ezra Friedlander is an Orthodox Jew who handles public relations, media strategy, and the staging of events for non-profit organizations in the greater New York area and in Washington D.C. Many of his clients represent Jewish causes, particularly but not exclusively in the Orthodox community. In the Sunday e-mailbox of San Diego Jewish World we found two examples of Friedlander’s work: A congratulatory photo of U.S. Sen. Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) with Sen. Charles Schumer (D-New York) and Friedlander following the former Newark mayor’s first swearing-in for a full 6-year Senate term. Another item from Friedlander told of Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop being honored by the Hudson County (N.J.) Jewish Business Alliance, recently formed by David Rosenberg to enable small business owners to network with elected officials. Fulop, described by Englander as a rising star in New Jersey politics, evidently was pleased by the gathering at the Fabuwood headquarters in Jersey City. He commented: “Working with our small businesses is one of the ways we will ensure Jersey City continues to grow and advance. It was a productive meeting and a great opportunity to get to know many of our local business owners and listen to their ideas.”

House of Representatives

REDISTRICTING — U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tennessee) has reintroduced the John Tanner Fairness and Independence in Redistricting (FAIR) Act to take the decennial congressional apportionment process, which often leads to partisan gerrymandering, out of the hands of politicians and give it to an independent redistricting commission. Congressman Cohen also introduced the FAIR Act in the 113th Congress. “It’s time to take politics out of the redistricting process,” said Congressman Cohen. “Congress is so polarized today that we’re unable to find common ground on the major issues facing our country. Instead of solving our nation’s problems, Congress is just kicking the can down the road and waiting until the next election for answers. I believe that if we eliminate the gerrymandering of districts we will help get more accomplished for our country.”

WOMEN’S CAUCUS — Congresswoman Lois Frankel (D-Florida) has been elected Vice Chair of the Congressional Women’s Caucus for the 114th Congress. “For more than 30 years, the Women’s Caucus has championed women’s issues in our country and around the globe – putting aside partisanship and embracing collaboration,” said Congresswoman Frankel. “I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to improve the lives of women and families.” Reps. Kristi Noem (R-South Dakota) and Doris O. Matsui (D-California) will serve as Co-Chairs. Rep. Susan Brooks (R-Indiana) will be the Republican counterpart to Congresswoman Frankel, both serving as Vice Chairs. Founded in 1977, the Congressional Women’s Caucus has been a leading advocate on issues advancing the lives of women and families. Caucus members have helped pass legislation on tougher child support.

GREAT LAKES — U.S. Rep. Sander Levin has joined a bipartisan group of House lawmakers in introducing the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2015, which continues the work of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative created by the Obama Administration in 2010. “Over the last six years, Congress has provided more than $1.9 billion for the GLRI, which funds restoration efforts in the Lakes, including cleaning up toxic hotspots; fighting aquatic invasive species, like the Asian carp; restoring critical habitat; and addressing polluted runoff that contributes to beach closures and harmful algal blooms in the Lakes,” Levin said. enforcement, promoting women’s health, helping women business owners, and protecting victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.

HEALTH CARE — Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Illinois) introduced the Public Option Deficit Reduction Act. This bill would create a publicly run health insurance plan that would be available in every Obamacare marketplace, an option that would save $158 billion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. “It’s time to pursue legislation that builds upon Obamacare,” Schakowsky said. “The Public Option Deficit Reduction Act is just that type of legislation. It would save consumers even more money, offering premiums that are 5 to 7 percent lower than private insurance plans and decreasing our deficit by $158 billion over 10 years. The public option means more transparent, lower-cost health care for Americans. This would be a win for consumers, taxpayers and our economy.”

California State Legislature

BULLET TRAIN — “High speed rail won’t just benefit travelers,” says Assemblyman Richard Bloom. “It has the potential to stimulate economic development across our state, especially in areas such as the Central Valley. The bullet train represents a new mode of transportation that, once complete, will allow riders to travel between Los Angeles and San Francisco quickly and without dependence on carbon emitting fossil-fuels. Other countries that have built high speed rail systems, such as Spain, Japan and France, have seen dramatic changes in the ways in which travelers move between destinations, shifting away from less environmentally-friendly modes of transport, such as cars and airplanes. As our economy grows, the demand for travel, both business and leisure, will continue to increase. Our current transportation infrastructure has become strained, with airports such as LAX struggling to meet demand. When voters approved bond funding for high speed rail, they made it clear that they are ready for this modern, greener mode of transportation. Building the bullet train is an investment in California’s future.”
