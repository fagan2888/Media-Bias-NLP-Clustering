He began by mocking expectations about his anatomy. \u201cI did not ever use any prosthetics in this film. That tiny little Brazilian bubble butt was all mine.\u201d This was all in good fun, but Leto\u2019s playing for laughs the process by which he prepared for the role of a person who felt uncomfortable in her body was not, really: \u201cIt was a very transformative role. I had to do a lot of things to prepare. One of the things I did was wax my entire body, including my eyebrows,\u201d Leto said to the audience\u2019s laughter.\n\nIt\u2019s an actor\u2019s job to prepare for a role in whatever way the script demands; it may have been difficult for Leto to wax his entire body, but it\u2019s sort of a weird punch line for a person whose entire role was about body discomfort and the painful modifications one must make to feel OK with oneself. Leto got money and at least one award for playing his part in \u201cDallas Buyers Club\u201d; it\u2019s strange that he didn\u2019t take into account the notion that his struggle was not, in fact, the most important one involved in his role.\n\nFor those who think I\u2019m reading too much into his speech at the Globes and his \u201cFresh Air\u201d interview in which he called his character \u201ctransgendered\u201d and said the film had no political valence, I\u2019d point to the fact that neither Leto nor his fellow winner Matthew McConaughey mentioned AIDS once in their respective speeches. These two men devoted months of their lives to a project specifically about the AIDS crisis, and then went off on tangents when accepting awards for their work about how goofy and weird it is to make your body like a transgender person\u2019s (Leto\u2019s speech) or about how your wife calls you \u201cking\u201d (McConaughey\u2019s).", "article_metadata": {"description": "The \"Dallas Buyers Club\" and \"Behind the Candelabra\" stars get awkward laughs at gay folks' expense", "title": "Jared Leto and Michael Douglas\u2019 homophobic Golden Globes speeches show the worst of Hollywood", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The \"Dallas Buyers Club\" and \"Behind the Candelabra\" stars get awkward laughs at gay folks' expense", "title": "Jared Leto and Michael Douglas\u2019 homophobic Golden Globes speeches show the worst of Hollywood", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/01/13/jared_leto_and_michael_douglass_homophobic_golden_globes_speeches_show_the_worst_of_hollywood/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/jared_leto.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The \"Dallas Buyers Club\" and \"Behind the Candelabra\" stars get awkward laughs at gay folks' expense", "title": "Jared Leto and Michael Douglas\u2019 homophobic Golden Globes speeches show the worst of Hollywood", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/jared_leto.jpg", "creator": "@dpd_", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Daniel D'Addario", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Golden Globes, jared leto, Michael Douglas", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca2f\"", "article_summary": "One of the things I did was wax my entire body, including my eyebrows,\u201d Leto said to the audience\u2019s laughter.\nLeto\u2019s speech managed to pat Leto on his own back while trivializing actual transgender people \u2014 he played a trans woman with AIDS, at the height of America\u2019s AIDS crisis.\n\u201cI did not ever use any prosthetics in this film.\nTopics: Golden Globes, jared leto, Michael Douglas, Entertainment NewsIn 2013, the actors Jared Leto and Michael Douglas, two men who date women, played, respectively, a transgender woman in the film \u201cDallas Buyers Club\u201d and a gay man in the TV movie \u201cBehind the Candelabra.\u201d And tonight they were honored for their efforts at the Golden Globes \u2014 where both men managed to, purposely or not, insult the very communities they were representing on film.\nI had to do a lot of things to prepare."}
