CHICAGO — Unexplained rash? Check your iPad. It turns out the popular tablet computer might contain nickel, one of the most common allergy-inducing metals.

Recent reports in medical journals detail nickel allergies from a variety of personal electronic devices, including laptops and cellphones.

It was an Apple iPad that caused a body rash in an 11-year-old boy recently treated at a San Diego hospital, according to a report Monday in the journal Pediatrics.

Nickel rashes aren’t life-threatening but can be very uncomfortable, and they might require treatment with steroids and antibiotics if the skin eruptions become infected, said Dr. Sharon Jacob, a dermatologist at Rady Children’s Hospital, where the boy was treated.

Doctors traced the boy’s rash to an iPad his family bought in 2010, which the boy used daily. They tested the device and detected a chemical compound found in nickel in the iPad’s outside coating.

He got better after putting the device in a protective case, she said.

Whether all iPad models and other Apple devices contain nickel is uncertain. Apple spokesman Chris Gaither said the company had no comment.

Jacob said evidence suggests nickel allergies are becoming more common, or increasingly recognized.

She cited national data showing that about 25 percent of children who get skin tests for allergies have nickel allergies, versus about 17 percent a decade ago.
