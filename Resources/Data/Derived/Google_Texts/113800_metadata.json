Kennedy is known to often side with liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan.\n\nMost Supreme Court experts say that votes Scalia would have taken on cases already argued cannot be applied in the final ruling.\n\nIn the event of a tie 4-4 vote, the lower court\u2019s ruling would be upheld, but possibly only for a short time.\n\n\u201cA tie vote does not have the stamp of approval of the Supreme Court,\u201d said John Malcolm, the director of The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the court had decided to not hear the case in the first place. It does not become a Supreme Court precedent.\u201d\n\nIndeed, while a 4-4 split would temporarily leave the prior court ruling in place, the Supreme Court will likely order the case reargued once a new justice is confirmed, according to Russell Wheeler, a Brookings Institution scholar who studies federal courts and the selection of judges.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s likely that the court in those situations may order reargument when it\u2019s back to 9 justices,\u201d Wheeler told The Daily Signal. \u201cBecause a majority of the Supreme Court justices thought it\u2019s important to have a national binding resolution on these issues, it doesn\u2019t become less important because of the death of one of its members.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how the key cases pending before the court this term may be impacted by Scalia\u2019s death.\n\nVoting rights (heard Dec. 8): In December, the court heard oral arguments on a case looking at whether to change the way state and municipal voting districts are drawn.\n\nThe case, Evenwel v. Abbott, concerns whether all residents or just eligible voters must be counted in creating voting districts.\n\nCurrently, total population is used. Counting just eligible voters would mean people such as children, immigrants living in the country illegally, prisoners, and some convicted felons would not be counted.\n\nWithout Scalia, a ruling allowing the counting of only eligible voters seems less likely, although Malcolm suggests the outcome might stay the same with or without him.\n\n\u201cThe conservatives might not have won anyway,\u201d Malcolm said.\n\nA 4-4 vote would keep in place an appeals court decision maintaining Texas\u2019 policy of counting everybody.\n\nAffirmative action (heard Dec. 9): During oral arguments in December, Scalia made controversial comments suggesting that some black students might be better off in a \u201cslower-track school\u201d rather than at a more competitive university. Scalia had been a critic of race-based admissions policies, believing they violate the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection.\n\nScalia\u2019s comments hinted that the court\u2019s conservatives seemed prepared to limit the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s use of racial preferences in undergraduate admissions decisions.\n\nBut even without Scalia\u2019s vote, the school\u2019s program still could be in trouble since liberal justice Kagan has recused herself because of her personal ties to the case, meaning a 4-3 vote in favor of conservatives is possible.\n\nThe Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin case is the only one in which Scalia\u2019s death eliminated, rather than created, the possibility of a tie.\n\nPublic-sector union fees (heard Jan. 11): Malcolm and Wheeler predict that conservatives are likely to be most adversely affected by Scalia\u2019s absence in a case where the challengers are asking the justices to exempt employees who are represented by unions\u2014but aren\u2019t members\u2014from paying union fees.\n\nA 4-4 split would leave in place a lower court decision that required employees to pay the dues, meaning the unions would be the winners in the case, Rebecca Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association.\n\nAbortion (to be heard March 2): Scalia\u2019s death may have no impact in this case, because legal experts have predicted that Kennedy could side with the liberals to strike down a Texas law imposing stricter standards on abortion clinics.\n\n\u201cIf Kennedy votes with the liberal justices, then it [Scalia\u2019s death] won\u2019t have an impact,\u201d Malcolm said.\n\nIf Kennedy surprises, creating a tie in the case, Whole Woman\u2019s Health v. Hellerstedt, the Texas restrictions would remain in place. But a 4-4 tie would not set a new national precedent for federal courts to follow, meaning the law would be limited to Texas.\n\nReligious liberty (to be heard March 23): With Scalia on the bench, religious non-profits such as Little Sisters of the Poor seemed likely to win an exemption from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s mandate that employers pay for contraceptives as part of health insurance plans.\n\nThe court is now more likely to split 4-4 and uphold a lower court ruling that leaves the contraceptive mandate in place, according to Malcolm and Wheeler.\n\nImmigration (to be heard in April): In perhaps the most high-profile decision before the court this term, the Supreme Court will rule on whether Obama can implement his executive actions on immigration before he leaves office.\n\nUnder the program, Obama would defer deportation and grant work permits to illegal immigrant parents of U.S. citizens and legal residents. Without Scalia, Obama needs at least one conservative justice to vote in his favor.\n\nA 4-4 tie in the case, United States v. Texas, would preserve the lower court\u2019s decision, placing an injunction on the program.\n\nIf that were to happen, the temporary nature of the split vote means the fate of some four million immigrants living here illegally would be in limbo.\n\n\u201cWe are in a period of uncertainty now,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cIt\u2019s bad to have all these 4-4 decisions because everybody puts all of this effort into them, and in the end, it doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death will likely change the outcomes of major cases coming before the high court this term.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death will likely change the outcomes of major cases coming before the high court this term.", "title": "How Scalia\u2019s Death Will Impact Cases on Immigration, Abortion", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ScaliaImpact.png", "updated_time": "2016-02-17T07:03:51+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1omqj3w"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death will likely change the outcomes of major cases coming before the high court this term.", "title": "How Scalia\u2019s Death Will Impact Cases on Immigration, Abortion", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/ScaliaImpact.png"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "supreme court", "published_time": "2016-02-16T17:17:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-17T07:03:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Scalia, executive action, immigration, Obama, abortion, voting rights, affirmative action, Texas, Supreme Court, Little Sisters of the Poor"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8011\"", "article_summary": "The Supreme Court will review six big cases this term\u2014on immigration, abortion, voting rights, unions, contraception, and affirmative action.\nMost Supreme Court experts say that votes Scalia would have taken on cases already argued cannot be applied in the final ruling.\nIn the event of a tie 4-4 vote, the lower court\u2019s ruling would be upheld, but possibly only for a short time.\n\u201cIf Kennedy votes with the liberal justices, then it [Scalia\u2019s death] won\u2019t have an impact,\u201d Malcolm said.\nA 4-4 tie in the case, United States v.
