That can\u2019t be true. Five minutes to apply for an Obamacare-compliant plan on the disastrous fail of a website?\n\nChris Edmunds identifies himself as a \u201ccertified Obamacare navigator.\u201d Judging by his Twitter feed, he\u2019s also a self-appointed Obamacare flack. On Monday he announced that applications were taking just five minutes on the awesome-sauce HealthCare.gov.\n\nHe corrected that tweet 16 minutes later. Whoops!\n\nI misspoke. Meant to say \"account creation\" and login taking under 5 minutes. System still slow on back end, but very manageable. \u2014 Chris Edmunds (@cedmundsjazz) October 21, 2013\n\nFive minutes for account creation is a whole lot different than five minutes to complete an application. But not to drooling Obamacare cheerleader (and possible secret composite woman) Tara McGuinness. The White House senior communications adviser uses her Twitter account to gleefully retweet Obamacare \u201cwins,\u201d and Edmunds\u2019 inaccurate tweet was no exception.\n\nNow getting my clients onto http://t.co/J4vCkobbH5. Application and login takes about 5 minutes. \u2014 Chris Edmunds (@cedmundsjazz) October 21, 2013\n\nLike President ShamWow, McGuinness kinda has a thing for these T-bone 404care \u201csuccess\u201d stories. Among the false stories she promoted and has yet to retract:\n\nFake Obamacare buyer Chad Henderson \u201cenrolled\u201d in Obamacare. (He didn\u2019t.)\n\n\n\nReporter Ryan Lizza had a trouble-free experience with the Obamacare website. (He didn\u2019t.)\n\nhttp://twitter.com/HealthCareTara/status/390888693416071168\n\nhttp://twitter.com/HealthCareTara/status/390888693416071168 And now, applying for health insurance takes just five minutes! (It doesn\u2019t.)\n\nYour tax dollars at work! But hey, what do you expect from a former Center for American Progress exec who ignores insurance cancellation notices and attempts to deflect Obamacare criticism by retweeting childish insults from prog blogger Oliver Willis.\n\nThat reminds us: How is it McGuinness still has a job? Wasn\u2019t the new White House line that meddlin\u2019 bloggerz \u042f dum-dums or something?\n\nWe\u2019ll leave Tara with this:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "title": "Unreal: White House Obamacare cheerleader rah-rahs yet another false story - twitchy.com", "og": {"site_name": "twitchy.com", "description": "Another 404care \"success\" story.", "title": "Unreal: White House Obamacare cheerleader rah-rahs yet another false story - twitchy.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://thisistwitchy.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/mcguinness-chad-henderson.png", "url": "http://twitchy.com/jennqpublic-3135/2013/10/22/unreal-white-house-obamacare-cheerleader-rah-rahs-yet-another-false-story/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "twitchy.com", "description": "Another 404care \"success\" story.", "image": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/cheerleader.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Unreal: White House Obamacare cheerleader rah-rahs yet another false story - twitchy.com"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/smalltile.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/largetile.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/widetile.png", "article": {"section": "US Politics", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2013-10-22T10:41:29+00:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://twitchy.com/wp-content/themes/twitchy2016/images/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc85e\"", "article_summary": "The White House senior communications adviser uses her Twitter account to gleefully retweet Obamacare \u201cwins,\u201d and Edmunds\u2019 inaccurate tweet was no exception.\nChris Edmunds identifies himself as a \u201ccertified Obamacare navigator.\u201d Judging by his Twitter feed, he\u2019s also a self-appointed Obamacare flack.\nBut not to drooling Obamacare cheerleader (and possible secret composite woman) Tara McGuinness.\nAmong the false stories she promoted and has yet to retract:Fake Obamacare buyer Chad Henderson \u201cenrolled\u201d in Obamacare.\n\u2014 Chris Edmunds (@cedmundsjazz) October 21, 2013Five minutes for account creation is a whole lot different than five minutes to complete an application."}
