Among the companies with shares expected to trade actively in Thursdayâ€™s session are Caterpillar, FedEx and Jabil Circuit.

Caterpillar offered a downbeat revenue and profit forecast for its first quarter, though it backed its full-year guidance, as the company continues to see its business challenged by falling demand.

FedEx Chief Executive Frederick Smith on Wednesday said the cost of e-commerce must go up to help support needed expansion to handle the flood in packages. The comments came as FedEx reported a 19% third-quarter profit decline largely due to legal settlements regarding its former independent contractor-driver model at its ground segment.

Jabil Circuit on Wednesday cuts its guidance for the year and projected downbeat results for the current quarter, warning of weaker demand in its mobility segment. Jabil makes products for technology companies like Apple Inc., which accounted for 24% of its revenue last year.

Guess on Wednesday warned it would swing to a first-quarter loss as it lays off workers as part of a broader cost-cutting effort following a steeper-than-projected profit decline during the holiday quarter.

Michaels said profit rose 17% in the latest quarter as sales easily topped forecasts, though the company warned its business would continue to battle unfavorable exchange rates and a weakened Canadian dollar.

Rofin-Sinar Technologies, a laser-products company contending with a harsh proxy fight, has struck a $942 million deal to be bought by Coherent.

Williams-Sonoma on Wednesday gave downbeat projections for the current quarter and year following disappointing results in the holiday quarter, weighed down by a comparable-sales decline at its Pottery Barn brand.

Herman Miller third-quarter profit rose 33%, as the office-furniture company reported continued progress in its North American business.
