Mayor Bill Peduto said he supports a new bill aimed at giving city employees six weeks of paid parental leave.

The bill’s sponsor, City Councilwoman Natalia Rudiak, echoes President Obama’s plea in his State of the Union address, saying the law makes good sense.

If it becomes law, city workers would be eligible for up to six weeks of paid leave when they have a baby, adopt or foster a child.

“This isn’t just a benefit for parents. It’s a benefit for all of us. Welcoming a child into the world is a crucial time in one’s life that deserves our full attention, and we know that when parents get to spend time with their children early on, all of society benefits,” Rudiak said.

She said the proposal makes good business sense because the majority of workers who take the leave will be retained. The health benefits are also far reaching, Rudiak said.

“Studies show that parental leave policies are the most cost-effective ways to reduce infant mortality, improve successful nursing of newborns and shorten hospital stays,” she said.

Right now, employees are eligible for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act.

Supporters of the bill said too many women face an agonizing choice of going back to work before bonding with their babies or staying home and watching their savings evaporate.

“That is a horrible, horrible, cruel choice, and we can’t be doing that to our city employees,” said Susan Frietsche of the Women’s Law Project.

Frietsche said 16 other cities and three states have passed similar measures, which have led to increased productivity and higher lifetime earnings for parents and children.

“Paid parental leave is not only compassionate; it is really good for the infant, for the health of the new mother. It’s an essential step on the road to women’s workplace equality and it’s good for the father, too,” Frietsche said.
