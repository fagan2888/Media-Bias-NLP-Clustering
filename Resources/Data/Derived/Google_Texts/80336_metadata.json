The reason was the law\u2019s mandate that larger employers provide health care coverage for those who work an average of at least 30 hours a week.\n\n\u201cMy guess is that this requirement cost me personally around $1,500 last year,\u201d Olsen wrote the Reader\u2019s Watchdog. \u201cIt also hurt the Ankeny School District in that there were many days last year that they were severely short of substitutes.\u201d\n\nOlsen\u2019s personal experience would seem to solidify what many critics feared.\n\nRepublican presidential candidates have been pledging to repeal or replace Obamacare, saying it is a job killer and hinders the country\u2019s economic recovery.\n\nUnion officials have predicted more workers will be phased from full-time to part-time to get around the mandate.\n\nBut among Democratic presidential candidates, support for the Affordable Care Act has been universal.\n\nAnd most research released thus far has concluded the act has dramatically increased the number of insured Americans with a nominal effect on the labor market or the economy.\n\nThis year, employers with 100 or more full-time employees have to insure at least 70 percent of their full-time workers under the 2010 act. In 2016, businesses with 50 or more full-time workers have to do the same for at least 95 percent of full-time workers, or pay a penalty.\n\nFull-time is defined as an average of 30 hours or more.\n\nOlsen, 46, wonders how many other school districts have cut substitute teacher hours since the requirements went into effect.\n\nHe says he\u2019s heard at least one Iowa district was having teachers sign a health care waiver, so subs could work more than 30 hours a week without being provided health care benefits.\n\nAnd he questions who regulates whether employers are really keeping workers to less than 30 hours a week when they want to bypass the health care requirements.\n\n\u201cThis is a national law. This is just one school district. What about all sorts of other employers? If school districts can get away with it, how is this part of the \u2026 law being enforced?\u201d\n\nSome subs sign off on no health care\n\nMost districts in the metro, including Johnston, Waukee and Des Moines schools, do not limit the hours of substitute teachers.\n\nWaukee schools officials admit they looked at the option but determined it \u201cwould degrade our ability to put substitutes in the classroom each and every day,\u201d according to Terry Welker, director of human resources.\n\n\u201cA normal substitute works a seven-hour day. If they work five days a week and we had those controls in place (the 30-hour limitation), they wouldn\u2019t be eligible to work on Fridays, which in turn, would negatively impact our teachers and students,\u201d Welker said.\n\nBut the Ankeny district admits it is making a big push to reduce the need for substitutes.\n\nSamantha Kampman, communications coordinator for the district, also confirmed the hours of substitutes were capped.\n\n\u201cIn light of our strategic plan and budget, we will not have substitutes work greater than 30 hours per week in this district. We also have decided not to utilize insurance waivers as advised by our legal counsel,\u201d Kampman wrote in a statement.\n\nContrary to what Olsen heard, the Ames Community School District doesn\u2019t require subs who work over 30 hours to sign voluntary waivers saying they don\u2019t need health insurance, a school official said.\n\nBut any employee of the district can opt out of coverage if they don\u2019t need it by signing a waiver, according to spokesperson Kathy Hanson.\n\nThe eight to 12 long-term substitutes the district uses every year do receive health care coverage, along with other full-time employees, she said.\n\nHow is it all regulated?\n\nLarger employers have to send their workers and the IRS notices about whether each worker was eligible for insurance, was offered it and received it.\n\nViolations of wage and hours rules, including Obamacare requirements, would be regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor.\n\nEarly numbers suggest act's success\n\nIowa Workforce Development officials tell me they have not tracked what has happened to worker hours in the state since the Affordable Care Act's requirements went into effect this year.\n\nSome researchers, like Maxim Pinkovskiy, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank, have concluded that the act does not appear to have \"substantially slowed the recovery or hurt it in its first year of implementation.\"\n\nBut \u201cits long-run impact on the U.S. economy remains to be seen,\" Pinkovskiy said in research released this month.\n\nIn some specific sectors nationally \u2014 franchises like Subway, grocery chains, colleges and universities, school districts \u2014 employers have reported reducing hours of workers because of Obamacare.\n\nAnd there is some early evidence from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggesting slightly more part-timers are being capped at 30 hours in the last two years.\n\nFor workers like Olsen, that stings. The whole purpose of the act, as he points out, was for more workers to have access to insurance.\n\n\u201cDo I wish every company sucked it up and did what\u2019s right by their employees? Absolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact is hours are getting cut to save on the bottom line. Whether we think that\u2019s good or justifiable, it\u2019s a reality.\u201d\n\nBut according to research released in September by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care policy research organization, there\u2019s been no widespread shift.\n\nIn fact, fewer than one-half of 1 percent of U.S. employees work 30 to 34 hours a week and are uninsured.\n\nNationally, worker hours have been trending upward and the unemployment rate has dropped from around 9 percent to 5.5. percent since 2010.\n\nSome part-time workers have also found that being insured through an exchange is cheaper than taking employer insurance.\n\nEconomist Gary Burtless at the Brookings Institution and Gary Claxton, a vice president at the Kaiser Foundation, have said the changing national economy has affected the labor market as much or more than Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever be able to go back and say what happened,\" Claxton said. \"It's a big workforce,and a big country. It may not show up in statistics.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1LAyCRY", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "John Olsen says he\u2019s working less and making less because of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.", "p": {"domain_verify": "372c291dc2b106308d26264f4fba3b10"}, "og": {"site_name": "Des Moines Register", "description": "John Olsen says he\u2019s working less and making less because of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Teacher: Are schools cutting hours because of Obamacare?", "url": "http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2015/10/17/teacher-schools-cutting-hours-because-obamacare/73990964/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/desmoinesregister.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "John Olsen says he\u2019s working less and making less because of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Teacher: Are schools cutting hours because of Obamacare?", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0574941573df163b6b1e0f70b6b0d6d4a9be31bf/c=448-0-1792-1344&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/15/IAGroup/DesMoines/635805097529899394-1008151607.jpg", "creator": "@DMRegister", "site": "@DMRegister", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600025120", "fb": {"app_id": 169766623060429}, "viewport": "width=1070", "article": {"author": "LeeRood/ReadersWatchdog"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Schools", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Places/Schools", "title": "Teacher: Are schools cutting hours because of Obamacare?", "author": "Lee Rood", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/35c06e026d08d9f848992cdb87b85ecf6f781390/c=616-0-1624-1344/local/-/media/2015/10/15/IAGroup/DesMoines/635805097529899394-1008151607.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/82ff0b369716e7587af7621b9048098e64b7b31a/c=448-0-1792-1344/local/-/media/2015/10/15/IAGroup/DesMoines/635805097529899394-1008151607.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2305a37d9448511635a9cfa9bcfb1f422826faa3/c=226-0-2014-1344/local/-/media/2015/10/15/IAGroup/DesMoines/635805097529899394-1008151607.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6ba454354962e2aa01fed45142348e5a63a7df40/c=0-39-2240-1305&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/15/IAGroup/DesMoines/635805097529899394-1008151607.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-10-17T15:11:16.150000-05:00", "shorthed": "Teacher: Are schools cutting hours because of Obamacare?", "articleid": 73990964, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0c1a79882fab4ab91f4987cd9839f24134bef9d1/c=0-39-2240-1305/local/-/media/2015/10/15/IAGroup/DesMoines/635805097529899394-1008151607.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9e32c3030e162201b795eff1748e6b96a9050501/c=744-0-1497-1344/local/-/media/2015/10/15/IAGroup/DesMoines/635805097529899394-1008151607.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "In 2016, businesses with 50 or more full-time workers have to do the same for at least 95 percent of full-time workers, or pay a penalty.\nIn fact, fewer than one-half of 1 percent of U.S. employees work 30 to 34 hours a week and are uninsured.\nThis year, employers with 100 or more full-time employees have to insure at least 70 percent of their full-time workers under the 2010 act.\nAnd there is some early evidence from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggesting slightly more part-timers are being capped at 30 hours in the last two years.\nLast year, the Ankeny Community School District capped at 29 the number of hours he could work each week as a substitute teacher."}
