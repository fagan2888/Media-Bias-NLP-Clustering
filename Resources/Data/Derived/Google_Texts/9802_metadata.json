Coaches, from day one, were telling us we could be the greatest team ever in Oregon history. They weren\u2019t wrong. They\u2019re totally right.\u201d\n\nCrook County, which bested runner-up Henley by 161.5 points, powered to another team title, behind its seasoned seniors, a determined acrobat and a depth that could not go unnoticed.\n\nThe backflip\n\nHayden Bates had that celebratory backflip planned for some time.\n\nA year after falling in the 132-pound state final, Bates came out strong against two-time defending champ Conner Noonan of Henley before holding on for a 5-4 victory and the 138-pound state title for Crook County.\n\n\u201cI worked hard all season long to get to this point. I wanted it so bad,\u201d said Bates, noting how much motivation last year\u2019s runner-up finish provided. \u201cIt\u2019s all I thought about all year. It\u2019s all I ever think about. It\u2019s a dream come true. Since I was a baby, it\u2019s everything I wanted. It means everything to me. Wrestling\u2019s my life.\u201d\n\nThe exclamation point\n\nTrayton Libolt\u2019s coaches have long instructed him to trust in his abilities, to believe that the strenuous work he put himself through this season would pay off, to wrestle with the confidence that a victory is in order.\n\nThat was exactly what Libolt did in the 126-pound final, and it came against former Crook County teammate Kurt Mode, now of Banks, as Libolt sealed a second consecutive and career-capping state title with a 7-3 win.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s insanely emotional,\u201d Libolt said. \u201cI\u2019ve been crying this whole time. I\u2019m just honored to be a part of this team. It\u2019s amazing \u2026 the best way you could end. I\u2019m so glad I could end with that.\u201d\n\nTwo other Cowboy seniors polished off their high school wrestling careers in similar fashion.\n\nAfter two straight seasons of placing second, Crook County\u2019s Gunnar Robirts defeated Austin Mitchell of Douglas 11-3 at 195 pounds to capture his first state title.\n\nIn the ensuing match, at 220 and in a rematch of last season\u2019s championship final, the Cowboys\u2019 Trevor Rasmussen pinned Scappoose\u2019s Devin Ray in 5 minutes, 1 second for a second straight title.\n\n\u201cAll the blood, sweat and tears I put into both of these (championships), you can\u2019t count \u2019em,\u201d Rasmussen said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great feeling, and it\u2019s way different from last year, definitely.\u201d\n\nThe arsenal\n\nOf the 20 wrestlers Crook County brought to Portland, 15 went on to place, including the four champions and five runners-up \u2014 Terran Libolt at 113 pounds, Cole Ovens at 145, Collbran Meeker at 152, Ryder Shinkle at 170 and Clark Woodward at 182.\n\nNot only that, Trey Shores (132 pounds) and Brendan Harkey (160) each placed third for the Cowboys, while Cole Morgan took fourth at 106. Carson Raymond and Zach Smith finished fifth at 182 and 285, respectively, and Pacer Quire was sixth at 113.\n\n\u201cThis team, my brothers that I get to go to war with every day, it\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime group of young men,\u201d Rasmussen gushed. \u201cThere\u2019s not another group I\u2019d want to have been with the last four years.\u201d\n\nThe legacy\n\nThe Cowboys rang up their third straight Class 4A team championship. And though no state records were set, there was no taking away from what Crook County accomplished, including the 327 points it piled up this weekend, which ranks second only to the 405.5 points the Cowboys scored here in 2014.\n\n\u201cWhat we did was amazing,\u201d Rasmussen said of last season\u2019s points record. \u201cEven if it does get beat down the road, we\u2019ll still know how much work we put in to get that record.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about the records,\u201d Libolt conceded. \u201cIt\u2019s just coming here and reaching your individual goal. All our Cowboys are just wrestling their hearts out. That\u2019s all that matters.\u201d\n\n\u2014Reporter: 541-383-0307, glucas@bendbulletin.com .", "article_metadata": {"description": "PORTLAND \u2014 Only Crook County can make 327 points seem like just another number.
