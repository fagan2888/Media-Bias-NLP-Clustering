Until the Pentagon upgrades to Fixmo, a new $16 million system compatible with the more advanced phones, some soldiers are going to have to carry the unpopular Blackberry.\n\nRelated: Hero or Villain: The American Public's Verdict on Edward Snowden\n\nAn email announcing the change and obtained by NextGov.com said, [Army personnel] \"have been told that between now and whenever this 'fixmo' is online, their Droids and iThings are simply to become useless. Expectation is that Droid and iThing users will be deviceless until March 2014 at earliest, and they can either do without or go back to a BB 9930,\" an older Blackberry.\n\nAccording to tech experts, the switch from more advanced phones to older model Blackberries is one small part of DOD\u2019s seemingly never ending task to secure data. DOD faces tremendous challenges on this front.\n\nJohn Slye, an advisory research analyst at Deltek, called what\u2019s unfolding at the Pentagon the \u201cperfect storm.\u201d First, DOD allowed soldiers to use late model smart phones, forcing the department to keep up security on mobile devices like iPads and Androids. Technology on these newer devices evolves quickly, forcing DOD to continuously update security software to keep up.\n\nAt the same time, soldiers are demanding more mobility in how they work.\n\nRelated: Here's How Edward Snowden Got Top Secret Clearance\n\n\u201cPeople are accustomed to using them for their everyday life. The warfighter wants to bring this technology to bear for their office work and a combat situation,\" Slye said. \"The question the Pentagon is asking now is, 'How do you adapt to the rapid mobility trend and combine that with security issues and a legacy network [the security network used on Blackberries is almost 10 years old]?\"\n\n\"It doesn\u2019t help that the rate of technology change continues to increase,\" he added. \"You\u2019re trying to adapt to things based on yesterday's standards.\"\n\nThe Pentagon does not include a budget line for data security in its annual budget. But according to an analysis by Biometrics Research Group, the United States is spending $5 billion on data projects this year, the majority of which are in the Pentagon. By 2017, they expect that that amount to rise to $8 billion.\n\nThis is because data security \u2013 or lack there of \u2013 has been front and center in the American security community since Edward Snowden made off with a treasure trove of classified documents. He leaked these documents to the press, forcing the White House to admit embarrassing details about its intelligence collecting activities around the world.\n\nRelated: Edward Snowden Could Derail the Global Economy\n\nLate Wednesday, documents leaked by Snowden revealed that the NSA collected 5 billion cell phone records per day. According to Alan Rusbridger, editor of the Guardian newspaper that published many of Snowden's documents, there are likely more disclosures to come.\n\n\"We have published I think 26 documents so far out of the 58,000 we've seen, or 58,000 plus. So we have made very selective judgments about what to print,\" he said during a parliamentary inquiry in London Monday.\n\nIronically, one of Snowden's revelations might be behind DOD's decision to limit mobile phone use. The National Security Agency had successfully targeted German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile device. If her phone is vulnerable, anyone\u2019s is.\n\n\"It\u2019s definitely part in parcel,\" Slye said when asked about the connection between DOD's security push and the Snowden revelations. \u201cFor security across government, the Snowden debacle is widespread.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not only phones DOD has to secure. Soldiers are using all different kinds of laptops and mobile devices to do their jobs. DOD is in a constant scramble to make sure that the data they access on these machines is secure.\n\n\u201cThis is why you see pushes for multi-level security,\u201d Slye said. \u201cDOD has to encrypt [data] in multiple ways. You can\u2019t do that without bringing that to bear on a whole host of mobile and wireless devices.\n\nTop Reads From The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In the wake of the", "title": "DOD\u2019s $5 Billion Push to Stop the Next Edward Snowden", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/05/DOD-s-5-Billion-Push-Stop-Next-Edward-Snowden", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12042013_Blackberry_Pentagon_Face.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/12/05/DOD-s-5-Billion-Push-Stop-Next-Edward-Snowden", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/12042013_Blackberry_Pentagon_Face.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@davidcfrancis"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "In the wake of the", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda44\"", "article_summary": "Related: Edward Snowden Could Derail the Global EconomyLate Wednesday, documents leaked by Snowden revealed that the NSA collected 5 billion cell phone records per day.\nRelated: Here's How Edward Snowden Got Top Secret Clearance\u201cPeople are accustomed to using them for their everyday life.\n\"It\u2019s definitely part in parcel,\" Slye said when asked about the connection between DOD's security push and the Snowden revelations.\n\u201cFor security across government, the Snowden debacle is widespread.\u201dAnd it\u2019s not only phones DOD has to secure.\nThis is because data security \u2013 or lack there of \u2013 has been front and center in the American security community since Edward Snowden made off with a treasure trove of classified documents."}
