Mizer, acting assistant attorney general of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, in a press release.\n\nCommerceWest Bank denied that \u201cany bank employee knowingly assisted with or willfully ignored sign of fraud being committed by V Internet,\u201d although it did acknowledge in a statement that it recognizes \u201cfactors pointed to a problematic customer that deserved more scrutiny.\u201d\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman told The Daily Signal today via email that the settlement was a direct result of Operation Choke Point.\n\n\u201cThis case arose from our investigations into consumer fraud at banks, payment processors and fraudulent merchants, which have been dubbed Operation Choke Point,\u201d said the spokeswoman.\n\nThe case of CommerceWest Bank is the Justice Department\u2019s second successful settlement reached under Operation Choke Point.\n\nLast April, Four Oaks Bank in North Carolina agreed to pay $1.2 million after facing accusations that it ignored warning signs of a scheme to defraud customers.\n\nUnder the program, banks are pressured to terminate relationships with customers deemed \u201chigh risk\u201d for fraud.\n\nBrian Wise, senior adviser at U.S. Consumer Coalition, a Washington, D.C.-based organization that has been leading the fight against Operation Choke Point, applauded the settlement with CommerceWest Bank, calling it \u201claudable.\u201d\n\nHowever, he said:\n\n\u201c[T]his is only the second settlement to come out of Operation Choke Point. There are potentially thousands of lawful and innocent businesses that have been negatively affected by Operation Choke Point. This begs the question: If the [Justice Department] already had the authority to do this under current law, why push a program that does more damage than good?\u201d\n\nWhile the agency maintains that it has \u201cno interest in pursuing or discouraging lawful conduct,\u201d critics say the program targets entire industries that the Obama administration doesn\u2019t like.\n\nMuch of the criticism resulted from a 2011 list that was created by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and was subsequently adopted by Operation Choke Point. The list labeled a range of both legal and illegal industries \u201chigh risk,\u201d and the agency advised banks against doing business with those enterprises.\n\nThe Daily Signal, along with U.S. Consumer Coalition, has documented accounts of legal and legitimate firearms dealers, tobacco sellers and check cashers affected by the initiative.\n\nMizer, acting assistant attorney at the Justice Department, signaled that the agency plans to continue its efforts to fight fraud by using Operation Choke Point\u2019s controversial tactics.\n\n\u201cAs the civil and criminal actions filed against CommerceWest Bank today demonstrate, we will hold financial institutions accountable when they choose unlawfully to look the other way while fraudsters use the bank\u2019s accounts to steal millions of dollars from American consumers,\u201d he said in a press release.\n\nWise, supporting the Justice Department\u2019s latest investigation, said the agency\u2019s \u201cextra-legal tactics\u201d are what pose a threat to business owners across America.\n\n\u201cThose opposed to Operation Choke Point have always contended that it is appropriate and necessary for the [Justice Department] to use their authority under [the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act] for cases like CommerceWest Bank\u2019s,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThis case arose from our investigations into consumer fraud at banks, payment processors and fraudulent merchants, which have been dubbed Operation Choke Point.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cThis case arose from our investigations into consumer fraud at banks, payment processors and fraudulent merchants, which have been dubbed Operation Choke Point.\u201d", "title": "DOJ Takes Credit for Second Choke Point Settlement", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150309_ChokePointSettlement.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-21T22:22:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1xe6iKT"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cThis case arose from our investigations into consumer fraud at banks, payment processors and fraudulent merchants, which have been dubbed Operation Choke Point.\u201d", "title": "DOJ Takes Credit for Second Choke Point Settlement", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150309_ChokePointSettlement.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "executive overreach", "published_time": "2015-03-12T03:01:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-21T22:22:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "choke point, operation choke point, justice department, CommerceWest Bank, fraud, doj"}, "article_summary": "The case of CommerceWest Bank is the Justice Department\u2019s second successful settlement reached under Operation Choke Point.\nThere are potentially thousands of lawful and innocent businesses that have been negatively affected by Operation Choke Point.\nBrian Wise, senior adviser at U.S. Consumer Coalition, a Washington, D.C.-based organization that has been leading the fight against Operation Choke Point, applauded the settlement with CommerceWest Bank, calling it \u201claudable.\u201dHowever, he said:\u201c[T]his is only the second settlement to come out of Operation Choke Point.\nMuch of the criticism resulted from a 2011 list that was created by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and was subsequently adopted by Operation Choke Point.\nOn Tuesday, the Justice Department announced it reached a $4.9 million settlement with CommerceWest Bank in Irvine, Calif., for knowingly enabling fraud."}
