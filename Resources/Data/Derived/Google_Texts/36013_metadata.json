Others sat in a grandstand in Duffy Square. Another brushed past an unsuspecting Spider-Man.\n\nBy the end of the night, police had arrested one of the topless women on prostitution charges while in a separate incident, a South Carolina businessman was charged with assaulting another one of the women over a missing wallet - proof, New York Police Department officials say, of the potential for disorder related to Times Square\u2019s legion of hustlers who call themselves street entertainers.\n\nThe bustling mix of panhandlers, traffic, tourists and commerce - along with the threat of terrorism - makes Times Square \u201cone of the most complex environments in the world,\u201d Police Commissioner William Bratton told The Associated Press. \u201cThe issue is how to keep it a safe and orderly place within the law.\u201d\n\nUnlike two decades ago - a seedier era when junkies, hookers and bar fights still were facts of life - Times Square is one of the safest spots in the city. Still, police officials argue that the type of enforcement that led to the recent prostitution arrest is one of the measures needed to keep it that way.\n\nToplessness and non-intimidating panhandling are legal in New York. But that hasn\u2019t curbed outrage over aggressive costumed characters and so-called desnudas - women wearing thongs and covering themselves only with patriotic body paint - seeking tips in exchange for photos. Police say some of the desnudas work in pairs or with handlers, and can make up to $300 a day.\n\nAs the women became a tabloid sensation, the NYPD announced it was forming a new unit of about 100 officers to bolster existing patrols in Times Square. The decision is part of broader program that will include greater use of security cameras and other counterterrorism measures, Bratton said.\n\nThe department already has been responding to complaints about hustlers by using techniques familiar in drug investigations; it deploys undercovers, plainclothes surveillance teams and intelligence to detect and deter crime related to the panhandling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of waiting and watching,\u201d Inspector Joseph Dowling, one of the commanders leading the initiative, said while touring Times Square. \u201cAnd when there\u2019s criminal activity, guys pounce on it.\u201d\n\nMuch of the enforcement has focused on peddlers who aggressively hawk homemade music CDs.\n\n\u201cYou can peacefully beg, you can peacefully ask for money, but what you can\u2019t do is intimidate people, block their path or hold onto them,\u201d said Lt. Daniel Albano of the NYPD Legal Affairs Bureau.\n\nIn the prostitution bust, two undercover officers posing as tourists approached desnuda Destiny Romero to take a picture with her. Phone numbers were exchanged with Romero and her handler, Jason Perez, and in a later phone call Perez offered to sell the undercovers drugs, police said.\n\nThe officers directed the suspects to a hotel, where Perez allegedly sold them cocaine and the synthetic drug \u201cmolly\u201d for $200 and Romero offered to perform oral sex for another $200 before both were arrested, police said. There was no response to messages left seeking comment from defense attorneys.\n\nEarlier that night, Mark Walters, 46, of Charleston, was arrested on charges he assaulted a topless woman after accusing her of being a pickpocket. In court, his lawyer complained that his client was the true victim.\n\nDespite the arrests, police don\u2019t expect more trouble from the painted women.\n\nSaid Dowling: \u201cThey know the focus is on them, so they\u2019re behaving.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the summer of topless, painted women in Times Square, a team of New York Police Department officers fanned out on a recent night in their own getups - shorts, T-shirts and backpacks that allowed them to blend in with the crowd.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "In the summer of topless, painted women in Times Square, a team of New York Police Department officers fanned out on a recent night in their own getups - shorts, T-shirts and backpacks that allowed them to blend in with the crowd.", "title": "Plainclothes cops keep eye out for Times Square hustlers", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/sep/5/plainclothes-cops-keep-eye-out-for-times-square-hu/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/05/4286a452ebf62427810f6a7067009761.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/09/05/4286a452ebf62427810f6a7067009761.jpg", "description": "In the summer of topless, painted women in Times Square, a team of New York Police Department officers fanned out on a recent night in their own getups - shorts, T-shirts and backpacks that allowed th", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Plainclothes cops keep eye out for Times Square hustlers"}, "Author": "TOM HAYS", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcdd1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of waiting and watching,\u201d Inspector Joseph Dowling, one of the commanders leading the initiative, said while touring Times Square.\nAs the women became a tabloid sensation, the NYPD announced it was forming a new unit of about 100 officers to bolster existing patrols in Times Square.\nThe bustling mix of panhandlers, traffic, tourists and commerce - along with the threat of terrorism - makes Times Square \u201cone of the most complex environments in the world,\u201d Police Commissioner William Bratton told The Associated Press.\n\u201cThe issue is how to keep it a safe and orderly place within the law.\u201dUnlike two decades ago - a seedier era when junkies, hookers and bar fights still were facts of life - Times Square is one of the safest spots in the city.\nIn the prostitution bust, two undercover officers posing as tourists approached desnuda Destiny Romero to take a picture with her."}
