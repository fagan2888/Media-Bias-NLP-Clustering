There are some big changes you need to know about when you file taxes this year.

You will be required to include health care information in order to file your tax return, and it could affect how much money you get back.

This all has to do with the Affordable Care Act.

11 News spoke with Kathy Bylkas, the owner of Your Taxlady in Colorado Springs. She says if you have insurance through the Marketplace, you will get a special form.

"They will by the end of the month get a 1095-A that they have to bring in when they do their taxes," said Bylkas.

Bylkas says if you get insurance through work, or have Medicare or Medicaid, you won't get a special form. However, it's important to tell that to the person preparing your taxes.

Bylkas says they are already getting calls about it.

"We're getting most of our calls from people asking about the Affordable Care Act. Most of them are calling saying they did not have insurance, how's it going to affect them," said Bylkas.

If you don't have insurance, you will face a penalty.

"When you file, they will tell you how much you're going to owe. And you should pay it before April 15th, but if you don't they will until your next year refund or they will start hounding you," said Bylkas.

The penalty is $95 dollars per person, or 1% of your household income, whichever is greater.
