The Pratt County sheriff says some students received minor injuries following a crash involving a school bus and semi.

The crash happened late Saturday morning on Highway 54, about 10 miles east of Pratt.

Sheriff Vernon Chinn said the bus sideswiped the semi, leaving several students with scrapes and bruises. One student was taken to the hospital.

The bus was carrying students from Fowler Public Schools USD 255. No names or ages were released.

Highway 54 was closed in both directions as emergency crews worked to clear the scene.

The Kansas Highway Patrol is investigating the crash and will release more information later in the day.
