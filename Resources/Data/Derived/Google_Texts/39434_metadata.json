Who are they? A few are a bit nutty, but also appealing in perverse political ways. One is beyond creepy and should crawl back under the snake-infested rock where he came. The rest spew the party\u2019s well-known anti-government lines. Let\u2019s take a closer look, starting with the most intriguing.\n\n1. North Carolina\u2019s Sean Haugh. Is he really a pizza delivery man running a campaign based entirely on YouTube videos? He seems to be exactly that, drinking a different craft beer as he delivers his folksy bromides from a basement bar stool. The WaPo said that he has raised $4,000, a fraction of one bitcoin, and recent polls give Haugh 8-to-11 percent of the vote. That showing boosts prospects for the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Kay Hagan, against her GOP rival, North Carolina House Speaker Thom Tillis.\n\nBut enough with the horse race\u2014what about those videos? Well, they\u2019re charming, and Haugh sounds almost sane as he lands on right-wing stances. This one, posted on July 9, is typical. Sitting next to a drained pint glass of Peacemaker beer, Haugh shares his thoughts on gun control laws:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not your typical Second Amendment absolutist. I don\u2019t like guns. I am committed to living a non-violent life. And that includes keeping weapons out of it as much as possible. You will not bring a gun into my home or my car. I want to end violence in every aspect of our lives. Now, not having a gun is my choice. I will be happy to tell you about my choice all day and all night long\u2026\n\n\u201cBut as a Libertarian, I know that trying to force others to make that choice does not work. Like what? I\u2019m going to hold a government gun to your head because guns are bad? That makes no sense.\u201d\n\nIf a lot of politics comes down to voting for who you want to have a beer with, Haugh certainly is that candidate. In fact, if you watch enough of his videos, he begins to look somewhatbuzzed most of the time. He\u2019s never drinking the same beer twice.\n\n2. Montana\u2019s Roger Roots. Now that we\u2019ve had some fun, it\u2019s time to be scared. In the late 1990s, Roots sued Montana Human Rights Watch for libel because they said that he was an organizer for the Klu Klux Klan in Billings. An appeals court threw out Roots\u2019 lawsuit, but not without citing even more alarming facts about his background in a lower court\u2019s ruling:\n\n\u201c[He] authored a publication entitled Whites and Blacks 100 Facts (and One Lie), which is advertised for sale nationally. The publication lists \u201cfacts\u201d about African-Americans, such as: blacks have low I.Q.\u2019s due to small foreheads; they have never invented anything; and they are more likely to have syphilis than whites. [Roots] is a columnist in the Jubilee, wherein one of his columns states that the Holocaust was a hoax.\u201d\n\nThat Court ruled Roots could not sue for libel because he was a public figure. Today, he still is a public figure. The Montana Newspaper Association and Montana PBS included Roots in a statewide debate for 2014 U.S. Senate candidates. In this YouTube clip, just posted by The Billings Gazette, it took about 20 seconds for Root to show how little he\u2019s moderated his views. Roots attacked the Democratic incumbent, Sen. John Walsh, and the Republican challenger, Rep. Steve Daines, over federal spending.\n\n\u201cThe main focus shouldn\u2019t be so much on earmarks, specifically, it\u2019s on the spending: the wreckless and irresponsible spending of these two government supremacist parties. Both of these man on stage spend like drunken sailors. Some people say that that is an insult to drunken sailors, because at least drunken sailors are spending their own money.\u201d\n\nDid we forget to mention that Roots also is a two-time felon, including gun convictions? MtCowGirl.com predicts he\u2019ll draw support from the state\u2019s Tea Party voters.\n\n3. West Virginia\u2019s John Buckley. Compared to the Wild West, the Libertarian running in West Virginia is almost sane. John Buckley is an ex-state legislator from Virginia and has worked for a gamut of right-wing think tanks: American Conservative Union, Cato Institute, and George Mason University\u2019s Law and Economics Center. The WaPo noted that he once made Rolling Stone\u2019scover, holding a Ronald Reagan bumper sticker.\n\nIn announcing his candidacy, Buckley espoused a \u201climited governent\u2026 live and let live\u201d philosophy for solving big problems. He then compared West Virginia to the enslaved districts in the Hunger Games books and movies, which surely will make voters back home feel good about themselves and him. Here\u2019s what Buckley said:\n\n\u201cDid you ever see \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d? Sometimes, it seems that Washington, D.C., is the same as the \u201cCapitol\u201d of Panem, administering West Virginia and our sister states just like the \u201cdistricts\u201d in the Hunger Games. The seemingly benevolent dictators in Washington, D.C., think they know what\u2019s best for us and, in regulating us so minutely, they keep us from thriving on our own. They set us against each other, all while the lobbyists in the capital city just get wealthier and wealthier at our expense.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Come November, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid might want to send thank you notes to these relative unknowns", "title": "7 libertarian upstarts who might help Democrats keep their U.S. Senate majority", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Come November, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid might want to send thank you notes to these relative unknowns", "title": "7 libertarian upstarts who might help Democrats keep their U.S. Senate majority", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/12/7_libertarian_upstarts_who_might_help_democrats_keep_their_u_s_senate_majority_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2011/08/why_the_senate_should_reject_the_debt_ceiling_deal.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Come November, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid might want to send thank you notes to these relative unknowns", "title": "7 libertarian upstarts who might help Democrats keep their U.S. Senate majority", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2011/08/why_the_senate_should_reject_the_debt_ceiling_deal.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Steven Rosenfeld", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, AlterNet, Democratic Party, Harry Reid, Libertarianism, libertarians, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc5a3\"", "article_summary": "Compared to the Wild West, the Libertarian running in West Virginia is almost sane.\nIs he really a pizza delivery man running a campaign based entirely on YouTube videos?\nThe Washington Post says the upstarts\u2014Sean Haugh, Roger Roots, John Buckley, Robert Sarvis, Thom Walker, Nathan LaFrance, and Mark Fish or Dave Patterson\u2014are attracting needed Republican votes.\nWest Virginia\u2019s John Buckley.\nHe then compared West Virginia to the enslaved districts in the Hunger Games books and movies, which surely will make voters back home feel good about themselves and him."}
