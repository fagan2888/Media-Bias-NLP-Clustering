Thankfully, the president\u2019s doctor has declared that the state of Barack Obama\u2019s health is strong.\n\nAfter seven years of continual stress and irregular sleep, Obama\u2019s wrinkles have deepened and his countenance has grown noticeably grayer since the golden days of his 2008 campaign, seeming to suggest poor health. Not so, says White House physician Dr. Ronny L. Jackson, who released Obama\u2019s long-form physical-checkup results on Wednesday. Obama has a low resting heart rate (56 b.p.m.), low blood pressure (110/68), 20/20 vision, and low cholesterol\u2014a shockingly normal bill of health for a man in charge of leading the free world and protecting the United States from Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, among other threats.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Obama weighs 175 pounds\u2014half a Taft, historically speaking\u2014which is five pounds less than his last physical exam in June, thanks to a combination of exercise and a good diet.\n\nThe report does contain one bombshell: Obama occasionally takes Nexium for his mild acid-reflux symptoms, which, if Republican lawmakers had their way, would disqualify him from the presidency. (The founders said nothing about acid reflux in the U.S. constitution.) Other medications used by the president include Vitamin D, taken daily, and the occasional piece of nicotine gum, which, ironically, is not covered by Obamacare.\n\nTrump, whose physician recently declared that he would be \u201cthe healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,\u201d has yet to come up with any insults about Barack Obama\u2019s health.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 54-year-old is a perfect specimen.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9Net 2016", "author": "Tina Nguyen", "og": {"site_name": "Vanity Fair", "description": "The 54-year-old is a perfect specimen.", "title": "President Obama's Medical Exam Reveals He is Shockingly Normal", "url": "http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/03/barack-obama-health-fitness", "image": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/56e08f4cbd5eda4641bcaa24/4:3/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/barack-obama-normal-health.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.vanityfair.com", "description": "The 54-year-old is a perfect specimen.", "title": "President Obama's Medical Exam Reveals He is Shockingly Normal", "image": {"src": "http://media.vanityfair.com/photos/56e08f4cbd5eda4641bcaa24/master/pass/barack-obama-normal-health.jpg?mbid=social_retweet"}, "site": "@VanityFair", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 7802537, "app_id": 1591153417872059, "pages": 8810407571}, "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "keywords": "barack obama,health", "pubdate": "2016-03-09T04:28:00Z", "viewport": "user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd709c\"", "article_summary": "Thankfully, the president\u2019s doctor has declared that the state of Barack Obama\u2019s health is strong.\nNot so, says White House physician Dr. Ronny L.
