Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting Inc. and chief executive officer of Pembroke's Drug Channels Institute.\n\nAbilene dermatologist Paras Ramolia wrote in an email that he definitely had noticed the trend in his practice, with some common creams rising in price by three to seven times.\n\n\"Same with antibiotics,\" he wrote. \"It has changed my prescribing habits, no doubt.\"\n\nIndependent pharmacist James McCoy said he, too, has seen generic prices fluctuate widely.\n\n\"We consistently see prices on things jumping tenfold, twentyfold, 400 percent, 600 percent,\" he said.\n\nOne medication that has received much attention for recent price increases is digoxin, a generic version of the drug Lanoxin, which some people take to control heart symptoms, Young said.\n\nA July 8 New York Times article reported that the three companies that sell the drug in the U.S. had increased the price they charge pharmacies, \"at least nearly doubling it since late last year, according to EvaluatePharma, a London-based consulting firm.\"\n\nConnecticut Attorney General George Jepsen is investigating the pricing practices of at least two companies that manufacture the drug.\n\nMcCoy said that at the beginning of 2013, he paid around $113 for 1,000 pills.\n\n\"Now, when you buy the thousand-count, it's $1,000,\" he said.\n\nAnother common example is the antidepressant amitriptyline, part of Burlock's medication, used to treat certain types of pain syndromes, headaches and other common ailments, Young said.\n\nThe cost spikes are concerning, Young said, for several reasons, including what they typically mean for patient compliance.\n\n\"If somebody comes in and the price of something has gone up ? doubled, tripled or quadrupled or even more ? then their gut reaction is always: ?I'm not going to take that,'\" he said.\n\nBut one should never stop taking any chronic medication without talking it over with a doctor, he said, and \"stopping any medication abruptly could be problematic.\"\n\nContemplating Costs\n\nSometimes, frustratingly, there is no clear-cut answer for why a generic drug's cost suddenly spikes, McCoy said.\n\n\"Everybody wants to blame Obamacare,\" he said. \"But we'll often call a generic company and ask why their price has skyrocketed, and there's just no set answer.\"\n\nReasons behind a surge in a generic drug's price are manifold, said Molly G. Minze, assistant professor of pharmacy practice with the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center School of Pharmacy in Abilene.\n\nFewer companies making a generic product can cause prices to rise rapidly because of the lack of competition, while drug shortages also can drive prices upward.\n\nMost FDA-approved drugs go through a standard life cycle.\n\n\"Brand-name medications only have one manufacturer, and they're usually pricey at the time just because of our market in America,\" Minze said, the drug manufacturers needing cash to recoup research and related costs.\n\nAfter a drug goes off patent and becomes a generic, more manufacturers are able to come in and replicate the drug, she said.\n\nTypically, those medicines have the same active ingredients as the brand-name drug, but they may have different inactive ingredients.\n\n\"The drug entity is still the same within each generic, but it may be a tiny bit different from one generic to the next,\" she said.\n\nWhat recently seems to be happening to \"not a lot of generics, but some,\" she said, is that the number of manufacturers has declined.\n\n\"So you almost get into the same type of situation like a brand-name product,\" she said. \"There may be only one generic manufacturer, so then, of course, they're able to increase their price.\"\n\nIn some cases, a particular physician or provider may like to use a certain, not-as-commonly-prescribed product. The laws of supply and demand then go into effect, and the price can rise simply because of scarcity, Minze said.\n\nIn certain rare cases, such as with the drug digoxin, there is no cheaper \"cousin\" to go to if prices increase.\n\n\"Digoxin doesn't have that (sort of) similar product, so the best thing (for patients) is to talk with their provider, their physician, to find an alternative,\" Minze said.\n\nProduct shortages appear to be the primary culprit for many recent increases, Fein found.\n\nFein's analysis found that half of the generic drugs examined (49.8 percent) showed declines in cost compared with July 2013.\n\nThe median decline was 6.8 percent, while 16 percent of the sample experienced declines greater than 10 percent.\n\nThe other half of the equation, though, saw a median increase of 11.8 percent, much higher than the median decrease, and some products had what Fein called \"mega increases.\"\n\nAmong nearly 2,400 generic drugs, 224 ? 9.4 percent of the total ? increased by more than 100 percent, according to his analysis.\n\nIn certain cases, cost increases were substantial. The National Average Drug Acquisition Cost for the antibiotic tetracycline, for example, increased from 5 cents to $8.59 for a 500-milligram capsule. Put into percentages, that is a whopping 17,714 percent rise.\n\nThe NADAC per unit for a 250 milligram tetracycline capsule rose from 6 cents to $4.26, a 7,340 percent increase.\n\n\"The retail supply chain has become very fragile,\" Fein wrote in an email to the Reporter-News. \"For many generic drugs, there are only a few suppliers. Any supply shock to the system, such as a manufacturing problem or FDA action, can rapidly create a shortage because alternative capacity isn't ramping up to meet demand.\"\n\nThe Best Medicine\n\nAlthough the price of certain prescription drugs, generic or otherwise, can be prohibitive, one must weigh the cost of taking the medicine against the price of not doing so.\n\nEven a very expensive drug still may be cheaper than a hospitalization that could follow if a patient who needs the medicine doesn't take it, he said.\n\nIn some cases, a more expensive option could be argued to be better therapeutically, Minze said, but ultimately the best medication is \"the medication a patient is going to take.\"\n\n\"If they aren't going to be able to take it or afford it, then it's better to use something that maybe isn't as good of a choice,\" she said, as long as the medicine is one that will affordably help the patient address their health issue.\n\n\"The biggest thing to remember is to communicate with your pharmacist and your doctor,\" Young said. \"If you have a hard time affording a medication that used to be in your price range, this needs to be discussed.\"", "article_metadata": {"title": "Rise in generic drug prices an increasing problem", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporternews.com/lifestyle/health/rise-in-generic-drug-prices-an-increasing-problem-ep-625142909-344854062.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/genericprescription1_8248822_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 426}, "type": "article", "description": "Generic drug prices for many popular medications are increasing, leaving many to absorb the costs.", "title": "Rise in generic drug prices an increasing problem"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/genericprescription1_8248822_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Generic drug prices for many popular medications are increasing, leaving many to absorb the costs.", "site": "@reporternews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Rise in generic drug prices an increasing problem"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-arn-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc738\"", "article_summary": "Contemplating CostsSometimes, frustratingly, there is no clear-cut answer for why a generic drug's cost suddenly spikes, McCoy said.\nIndependent pharmacist James McCoy said he, too, has seen generic prices fluctuate widely.\nFewer companies making a generic product can cause prices to rise rapidly because of the lack of competition, while drug shortages also can drive prices upward.\nGreg Young, manager of Hendrick Professional Pharmacy in Abilene, said stories like Burlock's are becoming \"really common\" because of recent fluctuations in prices in certain generic drugs.\nFein's analysis found that half of the generic drugs examined (49.8 percent) showed declines in cost compared with July 2013."}
