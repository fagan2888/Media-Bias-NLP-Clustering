(REUTERS/Carlo Allegri)\n\n4945108\n\nAn op-ed penned this month by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and published online appears to be blatantly plagiarized from an article written days earlier under former rival Ben Carson\u2019s name, The Daily Caller has determined.\n\nThe similar op-eds were written on the topic of America\u2019s territories and commonwealths.\n\nBoth pieces appear under the by-lines of the candidates. Carson\u2019s piece, published Feb. 26, was published in the Marianas Variety in the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nTrump\u2019s op-ed \u2014 published in the Pacific Daily News in Guam, part of the USA Today Network \u2014 was published 12 days later on March 9.\n\nIn some cases, full sentences and phrases \u2014 word-for-word \u2014 are lifted from Carson\u2019s. In others, some words and phrases are changed and added.\n\nTake the opening lines of both pieces as an example.\n\nCarson\u2019s piece begins: \u201cMANY Americans do not appreciate the patriotism exhibited by our brothers and sisters in the Territories of American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how Trump\u2019s piece beings (with the exact wording from Carson\u2019s piece bolded): \u201cThroughout the history of our nation, the patriotism exhibited by our brothers and sisters in the Territories of American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands has often gone unacknowledged.\u201d\n\nAt another point, Trump\u2019s op-ed uses, word-for-word, two identical sentences from Carson\u2019s article: \u201cMedical care in the American territories and commonwealths has historically lagged far behind the continental states, and Obamacare has only made the situation worse. Good health is an essential part of a thriving society and economy, and citizens of the territories and commonwealths deserve policies that work.\u201d\n\nDo You Think This Disqualifies Donald Trump In Your Mind?

Ahead of Florida\u2019s primary, the former neurosurgeon endorsed Trump last week.\n\nReached by phone, Carson adviser Armstrong Williams declined to comment other than to reference some of Carson\u2019s old campaign staffers and say: \u201cThere\u2019s no question they\u2019re working for Mr. Trump now.\u201d\n\nThe Saipan Tribune, a local news outlet in the Northern Mariana Islands, reported that a local Republican named Jason Osborne, who worked for Carson before joining Trump\u2019s team, was involved in crafting the op-ed.\n\n\u201cPlagiarizing ideas, when you accept those ideas, isn\u2019t plagiarism, it\u2019s just flattery,\u201d Osborne told the outlet.\n\nThe Daily Caller has reached out to Trump\u2019s campaign.\n\nSee the similarities below:\n\nVince Coglianese contributed to this report.\n\nFollow Alex on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pappas", "description": "An op-ed penned this month by Donald Trump appears to be blatantly plagiarized from an article written days earlier under former rival Ben Carson\u2019s name.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "An op-ed penned this month by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and published online appears to be blatantly plagiarized from an article written days earlier under former rival Ben Carson", "title": "Trump Appears To Have Heavily Plagiarized Op-Ed From Carson", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2016/03/16/trump-appears-to-have-heavily-plagiarized-op-ed-from-carson/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Ben-Carson-Donald-Trump-Plagiarism-Reuters-e1458152578867.jpg", "height": 516}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump's nearly-identical op-ed published 12 days later", "title": "Trump Appears To Have Heavily Plagiarized Op-Ed From Carson Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2016/03/16/trump-appears-to-have-heavily-plagiarized-op-ed-from-carson/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Ben-Carson-Donald-Trump-Plagiarism-Reuters-e1458152578867.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-03-16 14:31:27", "sailthru.title": "Trump Appears To Have Heavily Plagiarized Op-Ed From Carson", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "ben-carson,donald-trump,elections-2016,alex-pappas", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "ben carson,donald trump,elections 2016", "sailthru.description": "An op-ed penned this month by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and published online appears to be blatantly plagiarized from an article written days earlier under former rival Ben Carson", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Ben-Carson-Donald-Trump-Plagiarism-Reuters-e1458152578867.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks with Ben Carson after receiving Carson's endorsement at a campaign event in Palm Beach, Fla., March 11, 2016.\nCarson\u2019s piece, published Feb. 26, was published in the Marianas Variety in the Northern Mariana Islands.\n(REUTERS/Carlo Allegri)4945108An op-ed penned this month by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and published online appears to be blatantly plagiarized from an article written days earlier under former rival Ben Carson\u2019s name, The Daily Caller has determined.\nTrump\u2019s op-ed \u2014 published in the Pacific Daily News in Guam, part of the USA Today Network \u2014 was published 12 days later on March 9.\nCarson dropped out of the Republican race for president after a disappointing finish in the March 1 SEC primary."}
