NEW YORK (AP) — Drake didn’t have a band, but the feverish audience at Governors Ball played along like they were onstage with the multiplatinum rapper. One hyped fan even jumped onstage.

Drake headlined the first night Friday of the three-day festival on Randall’s Island in New York City, working the stage from left to right as he ran through his catalog of hits, from “Started From the Bottom” to “Know Yourself,” during which a fan jumped onstage, but was quickly pulled away by security.

Drake was just energetic during his 75-minute performance. He jumped around in super slim black pants and a neon hoodie almost as bright as the fireworks that burst near the end of his set.

He called the audience “the best festival crowd I’ve ever seen in my life.”
