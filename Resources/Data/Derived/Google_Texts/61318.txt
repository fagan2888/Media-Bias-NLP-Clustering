With 40 minutes until the polls close, the Cuccinelli campaign sent out this message:

We’re seeing some of the Exit Polls say this race is a complete toss up.

If you haven’t voted yet, you have to be in line at your precinct by 7pm. As long as you are in line, you can vote.

Make sure everyone in your family has voted.

Make sure all of your friends have voted.

Please post on Facebook or Tweet that you are supporting my campaign and remind your social network to go vote.

We can win this race and we have till 7pm to make it happen.
