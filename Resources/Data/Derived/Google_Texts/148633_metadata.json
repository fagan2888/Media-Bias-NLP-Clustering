(AP) - Patience is one virtue few football players are familiar with.\n\nThen they get injured and they have little choice.\n\nVictor Cruz can\u2019t wait to be running all those zigs and zags, posts and fly patterns. But he has to wait, and the receiver is spending most of this week\u2019s New York Giants minicamp observing.\n\n\u201cWhen you sit down and you have to be patient, it\u2019s kind of forced upon you, and I was kind of OK with that,\u201d says Cruz, who tore right knee ligaments in the sixth game of 2014 and has been working his way back ever since.\n\n\u201cThe last four years of my life have been just so fast-paced and rapid, and going after it. This year I finally got to take a step back and look at it all a little bit, so it was good for me. I kind of had a retooled mindset of just going out there and playing.\u201d\n\nExcept he can\u2019t go out and play, or even practice. Cruz knows he can\u2019t push things, even when he wants to.\n\nSo he listens to the medical staff, goes through his paces with trainers - and looks ahead to the opening of training camp at the end of July, when he plans to be the dynamic receiver he has been through his previous seasons.\n\n\u201cObviously, you want to push it and continue to go on the path of getting back to 100 percent, but you need your recovery days, too,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cSo it will be a little of both, the training staff and myself are working on putting a regimen together that tailors both of those things, so we\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d\n\nCruz isn\u2019t the only Giant eager to see him back on the field, teaming with Odell Beckham Jr., last season\u2019s Offensive Rookie of the Year, and Rueben Randle. Coach Tom Coughlin, offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo, quarterback Eli Manning - well, just about everyone on the offensive side of the ball - can\u2019t wait.\n\n\u201cOnce we can all get out there, get to bond, it will really be good,\u201d Randle says. \u201cHopefully we can play a full season together.\u201d\n\nOne of the best slot receivers in the league, Cruz hasn\u2019t played a full schedule since 2012. When healthy, he has been Manning\u2019s top target, able to make key possession catches, but also break long plays.\n\nHis versatility fits perfectly in McAdoo\u2019s version of the West Coast offense. And with Beckham emerging as such a dangerous threat, double-teaming Cruz will be difficult for opposing defenses.\n\nOf course, none of that will happen until Cruz gets fully fit. Once again, patience must be the plan.\n\n\u201cI want to come out here, come end of July, from a personal standpoint, and be kind of ready to go,\u201d he says. \u201cBe healthy, and from a physical standpoint, my wind, just have everything ready to go come July 29, July 30. Then let the training staff kind of pull me back and let me know what they want from that point.\n\n\u201cBut I want to come in ready to go, energized, fully healthy, running, and be good to go.\u201d\n\nHow good can Cruz be? If he recaptures the speed and elusiveness that marked his performances from 2011-2013, he can be both reliable and a game breaker.\n\nIn 2011, his first full pro season, he made 82 catches for 1,536 yards (a superb 18.7 yards per reception) and nine touchdowns. Oh yeah, the Giants won the Super Bowl that season.\n\nCruz increased his production to 86 catches the next year, but they were generally shorter routes, and he had 10 TDs. He was having another strong season in 2013 when he hurt his left knee, limiting him to 14 games and 73 receptions. But he already had 998 yards receiving.\n\nHis sights now are set on 16 games - and some postseason work, too.\n\n\u201cI have nothing to hold back any more, I have nothing to look forward to - obviously winning and individual stuff and team stuff. But from an individual standpoint, I just want to go out there and play and enjoy kind of the second half of my career a little bit. Just enjoy it. A lot of guys don\u2019t play six, seven-plus years in this league, and I just want to enjoy it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "article_metadata": {"description": "Patience is one virtue few football players are familiar with.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Patience is one virtue few football players are familiar with.", "title": "Not cruising yet: WR Cruz has learned to be patient", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/17/not-cruising-yet-wr-cruz-has-learned-to-be-patient/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/17/c45686230d33a91b790f6a7067002bf5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/17/c45686230d33a91b790f6a7067002bf5.jpg", "description": "Patience is one virtue few football players are familiar with.", "card": "summary", "title": "Not cruising yet: WR Cruz has learned to be patient"}, "Author": "BARRY WILNER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Victor Cruz can\u2019t wait to be running all those zigs and zags, posts and fly patterns.\n\u201cBut I want to come in ready to go, energized, fully healthy, running, and be good to go.\u201dHow good can Cruz be?\nThen let the training staff kind of pull me back and let me know what they want from that point.\nCruz increased his production to 86 catches the next year, but they were generally shorter routes, and he had 10 TDs.\nCruz knows he can\u2019t push things, even when he wants to."}
