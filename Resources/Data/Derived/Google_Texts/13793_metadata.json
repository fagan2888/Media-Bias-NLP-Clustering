Nigeria\u2019s weight in the key frontier markets index has grown considerably with the upgrade to emerging market status of Qatar and United Arab Emirates. Reuters\n\nThis week, the UAE and Qatar, which until the end of May together made up more than one-third of the MSCI Frontier Markets Index, officially graduated to the MSCI\u2019s Emerging Market Index. As members of the emerging markets index, the two countries will be minnows alongside whales such as China and Brazil.\n\nTogether, they represent just over 1% of the value of the EM index.\n\nTheir new status as small fish in a much larger pond is a far cry from their position in the frontiers index. Because they counted for such a significant portion of the index, their removal has triggered a meaningful reconfiguration of the frontier index.\n\nThe rebalancing leaves FM-index-based investors heavily exposed to Kuwait, which now makes up roughly 27% of the index, and Nigeria, with a roughly 20% weighting in the new configuration.\n\nWhat does this mean for frontier-market investors?\n\nFor those in index-tracking funds it could lead to a significant change in performance. Not only did Qatar and the UAE make up a major chunk of the value of the index, they had been star performers, particularly over the past year after MSCI announced its plan to upgrade the two nations.\n\nIn the 12 months to the end of May this year, Qatar\u2019s stock market was up almost 50%. The UAE, which has two stock markets, saw even stronger gains. While Abu Dhabi\u2019s market was up 46% on the year, the Dubai index more than doubled, posting gains of 115%.\n\nWSJ Frontiers Newsletter Enter your email to be notified when we launch the new WSJ Frontiers weekly email newsletter\n\nWithout the two powerhouses in the FM index, investors are concerned that its growth, which topped 29% for the year to the end of May 2014, could falter. Kemal Ahmed, portfolio manager of South Africa-based fund manager Investec\u2019s Horizon Markets Fund, says the recent strong rise in the FM index has been dominated by returns from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. \u201cNow the UAE and Qatar have graduated it is unclear what the frontier market index\u2019s prospects are going to be for the second half of 2014,\u201d he says.\n\nCorin Frost manages $1.7 billion in frontier market assets as global head of Index Strategy at BlackRock in San Francisco. He believes investors can still find good valuations in the frontier index following the exit of these two countries.\n\nIn Mr. Frost\u2019s view, the new frontier index is a better representation of that segment of the global investing pie. \u201cThe areas that we find exciting from a diversification perspective would be sub-Saharan Africa, countries such as Nigeria and Ghana. Those really do represent in investors\u2019 minds the true frontier markets,\u201d he says.\n\nOthers agree that the new configuration of the frontier index will give investors exposure to \u201ctruer\u201d frontier markets. \u201cThe presence of the UAE and Qatar was skewing the frontier index toward countries that were not really frontier,\u201d says Andrey Kutuzov, associate portfolio manager with Wasatch Advisors in Salt Lake City, Utah. Wasatch\u2019s Frontier Emerging Small Countries Fund holds some $1.3 billion in assets. \u201cRemoving those countries is a net positive for the frontier index because the index will become more truly representative of the frontier universe. Investors will get exposure to countries at an earlier stage of the economic development than emerging markets.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is happy with the new distribution of countries in the frontier index, however. David Wickham, director of global emerging markets and frontier markets equity at HSBC Global Asset Management, doesn\u2019t think the new configuration gives investors the desired frontier market exposure. \u201cThe skews in the index have become more profound,\u201d with Kuwait and Nigeria taking a more prominent chunk of the frontier index, says Mr. Wickham.\n\nHowever, even though this is the first time MSCI has upgraded countries from frontier to emerging status, it might not be the last. Argentina, which was downgraded from emerging to frontier in May 2009, has been mooted as a potential candidate to move up the ladder again.\n\nAsha Mehta, portfolio manager of the $320 million Acadian Frontier Markets Equity Fund, sees these upgrades as catalysts that help investors generate returns. Ms. Mehta believes Pakistan might be upgraded in the future. \u201cThe institutional standards are quite strong, in line with emerging markets,\u201d she adds.\n\nThese changes aren\u2019t likely to happen overnight and they will take place depending not only on fundamentals but also on investors\u2019 opinions. So what should those looking to benefit from any of these likely moves do to cash in?\n\nAnticipate events and actively manage their portfolio, says Ms. Mehta. \u201cInvestors need to know how to anticipate these events, even if they are two years early,\u201d she says. \u201cThey also need to have a very active stock selection.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Dan Keeler.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Index-tracking frontier-market funds may see a marked change in performance in the wake of the removal of Qatar and UAE from the MSCI Frontier Markets Index.", "title": "Investors Chart New Course as Index Stars Graduate", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/06/04/investors-chart-new-course-as-index-stars-graduate/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DB929_lagos2_P_20140604110312.jpg"}, "site": "frontiermarkets", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Markets", "article.headline": "Investors Chart New Course as Index Stars Graduate", "description": "Index-tracking frontier-market funds may see a marked change in performance in the wake of the removal of Qatar and UAE from the MSCI Frontier Markets Index.", "article_section": "Markets", "author": "Javier Espinoza", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Frontier Markets Blog", "page.subsection": "Frontier Markets", "article.summary": "Index-tracking frontier-market funds may see a marked change in performance in the wake of the removal of Qatar and UAE from the MSCI Frontier Markets Index.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-06-04T15:23:10-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-126", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/06/04/investors-chart-new-course-as-index-stars-graduate/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-265B-700", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Markets", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Index-tracking frontier-market funds may see a marked change in performance in the wake of the removal of Qatar and UAE from the MSCI Frontier Markets Index.", "title": "Investors Chart New Course as Index Stars Graduate", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2014/06/04/investors-chart-new-course-as-index-stars-graduate/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DB929_lagos2_P_20140604110312.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Frontier Markets", "article.id": "BL-265B-700", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-06T22:12:12-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd710\"", "article_summary": "Because they counted for such a significant portion of the index, their removal has triggered a meaningful reconfiguration of the frontier index.\nOthers agree that the new configuration of the frontier index will give investors exposure to \u201ctruer\u201d frontier markets.\nAs members of the emerging markets index, the two countries will be minnows alongside whales such as China and Brazil.\n\u201cThe skews in the index have become more profound,\u201d with Kuwait and Nigeria taking a more prominent chunk of the frontier index, says Mr. Wickham.\nIn Mr. Frost\u2019s view, the new frontier index is a better representation of that segment of the global investing pie."}
