Navigators are preparing for an event in Wichita next week to help consumers decide on a health insurance plan. Coventry insurance will no longer be offered, so consumers will need to pick another option in the federal marketplace.

A coalition of community health centers, clinics and area hospitals are partnering to host the event at Wichita’s Century II to help people sign up and get questions answered about available health insurance. Navigator project coordinator Veronica Miranda with Cover Kansas says there are two companies offering coverage in the marketplace.

"All the consumers that had a Coventry plan will need to visit the marketplace before December 15th to select a new health plan with either Blue Cross Blue Shield or United Health Care," Miranda says. "Those are the two companies that will be participating in the marketplace for 2016."

Miranda says plans and premiums do change, so it’s recommended that consumers visit the marketplace annually. She says eight out of 10 people enrolled in the marketplace qualified for financial assistance. Navigators will help determine who would qualify.

The enrollment event will take place at Century II on Dec. 5.
