Question: Explain what you do.

Answer: I help clients prepare financial statements and complex income tax returns for businesses and their owners. I also help clients with financial reporting requirements for bonding and lending needs. Simply said, I’m an auditor and tax accountant.

Q: How did you get into the business?

A: In college, I took many general business courses just to ensure that I had a well-rounded education. I wanted the necessary tools and education to run any business I pursued after college. After about a year of that, I realized that I really liked financing and accounting, and decided to pursue a career as a certified public accountant.

Q: What are the biggest challenges you or your industry face?

A: One of the most difficult challenges our industry faces is complying and advising clients on the constantly changing financial and regulatory requirements that occur each year. Examples would be IRS regulations, the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare), economic uncertainties, generally accepted accounting principles, etc. As well as getting away from the public perception that accountants are just a necessary evil and that all accountants are dull and boring.

Q: What are the biggest rewards of your job?

A: My biggest reward is working with my clients and their employees. I get to know them personally, and that is very rewarding. It helps me connect with them on a much closer level. Plus, our business is seasonal, so I have periods of down time which helps me enjoy the outdoor activities that I love.

Q: What advice do you have for someone else thinking about a career in your field?

A: Make sure you have well-rounded knowledge including both financial statement accounting and taxation. Most people concentrate on one of those areas, but having knowledge of both will help you better understand your clients’ needs.

Q: What do you do in your leisure time?

A: Pretty much anything outdoors. I love to hunt, fish, attend Denver Broncos and CSU athletic events, as well as play golf.

Q: What did you want to be when you grew up?

A: Well, like most kids, I wanted to be an astronaut or a professional athlete. Then I got a little older, and I decided I wanted to be an optometrist since most of the people in my family all had glasses or contacts.

Q:What kept you from pursuing that vision?

A: I played football, but lacked the natural-born ability to become a professional athlete. My college didn’t have an optometry program, so I decided to pursue a business degree. After about a year, I realized that a finance and accounting career was what I wanted.

Q: Where do you see yourself careerwise in 10 years?

A: As a partner with a public accounting firm.

Q: Outside of work, what’s your favorite thing to do and your favorite place to do it?

A: In the spring and summer, it is mostly golf on any course I can play. In the fall, I enjoy hunting on the family ranch/farm in Nebraska. In the winter, I don’t have much free time due to my career, but when I can, I love to head up to the mountains and snowboard.

Q: What role does volunteerism/giving back play in your work or personal life?

A: My parents and other family members are educators and coaches, so helping others was always demonstrated to me from an early age. I currently volunteer/serve on the board of directors for the Youth Football Academy, help certain organizations with their fundraising and help run some memorial golf tournaments. Serving in this capacity has broadened my view of Fort Collins as a community and helped me meet people I wouldn’t normally meet.
