If everyone's feeling classy, there might even be clean floors and a not-terrible scent.\n\nBrookfield, Wisconsin, is one of three towns in the greater Milwaukee area that might soon have a store that forgoes one of those agreed-upon features. Operated by the owners of a local chain of furniture stores called Penny Mustard, the proposed venue would have an array of mattresses for prodding and testing, but it won't have any staff. The stores would open and close electronically, and would be presided over only by security cameras and a lone computer. (Applications for the stores have been submitted to Brookfield's zoning administrator, and it was recently reported that officials would be moving forward with the plans.)\n\n\"Bad things happen in unsupervised areas,\" says Mullaney, \"especially if there\u2019s a bed there.\"\n\nA store without a staff is an idea that, at least at its core, might have some merit: \u201cI think that their concept, that people only want help when they\u2019re ready for help, and don\u2019t want to be hovered over, is absolutely true,\u201d says Kevin Mullaney, president of the retail consulting firm The Grayson Company, which helped Tempur-Pedic launch its own retail stores. The appeal of the new Penny Mustard store would in part come from its simulation of the pressure-free home-shopping experience many have come to prefer.\n\nMullaney isn\u2019t convinced by the concept, though. \u201cI think the idea of an unattended store\u2026is dangerous,\u201d he says. With only security cameras to deter them, patrons (not to mention thieves) could theoretically run wild. \u201cBad things happen in unsupervised areas,\u201d says Mullaney, \u201cespecially if there\u2019s a bed there,\u201d declining to elaborate for a probably pretty good reason.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It&#39;ll be like a vending machine\u2014but for mattresses.", "author": "Joe Pinsker", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "It&#39;ll be like a vending machine\u2014but for mattresses.", "title": "Coming Soon: A Milwaukee-Area Mattress Store With No Salespeople", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/07/541636786_fffd23ae21_o/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/07/coming-soon-a-milwaukee-area-mattress-store-with-no-salespeople/374494/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbd93\"", "article_summary": "The unwritten contract between customer and retailer is fairly straightforward: A store will have merchandise, salespeople, and a somewhat orderly checkout process.\nBrookfield, Wisconsin, is one of three towns in the greater Milwaukee area that might soon have a store that forgoes one of those agreed-upon features.\n\u201cBad things happen in unsupervised areas,\u201d says Mullaney, \u201cespecially if there\u2019s a bed there,\u201d declining to elaborate for a probably pretty good reason.\nThe stores would open and close electronically, and would be presided over only by security cameras and a lone computer.\n\"Bad things happen in unsupervised areas,\" says Mullaney, \"especially if there\u2019s a bed there.\""}
