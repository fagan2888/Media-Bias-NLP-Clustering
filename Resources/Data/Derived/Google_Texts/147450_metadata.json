If the federal government\u2019s new proposal goes according to plan, you won\u2019t have to.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education announced Monday that it wants to streamline the way grads pay off their federal student loans. The department plans to create an online student loan portal where all borrowers would make payments, sign up for repayment plans and find answers to student loan questions.\n\nAs it stands now, borrowers must work with their student loan servicers for those purposes. Servicers are private companies contracted by the government to collect payments from federal student loan borrowers and keep loans in good standing.\n\nBut working with servicers is a common source of confusion for borrowers, says Betsy Mayotte, director of regulatory compliance at American Student Assistance, a nonprofit that provides student loan education. \u201cBorrowers saying it\u2019s complicated to keep track of their loans has been a running theme for many years,\u201d she says.\n\nRelated: Worried About Student Loans? A New Repayment Plan May Help\n\nBorrowers\u2019 experiences can also vary from company to company, according to student loan advocates and as detailed in a September 2015 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau student loan servicing report. In a blog post announcing the initiative, U.S. Undersecretary of Education Ted Mitchell said one goal of the new platform would be to remove the need for grads to know which servicer they\u2019ve been assigned.\n\n\u201cIt really shouldn\u2019t matter who your servicer is,\u201d says Jennifer Wang, director of the Washington, D.C., office of the Institute for College Access and Success. \u201cBorrowers should have consistent, accurate information regardless of whether they have one servicer or another servicer.\u201d\n\nSo what would the Department of Education\u2019s plan mean for you? Here are the basics:\n\nIf you wanted to make an online student loan payment, you would do it on the new government-run portal, not your servicer\u2019s website. Your servicer would work behind the scenes to collect and process your loan payments and requests for a different repayment plan.\n\nCommunication about student loans would come from the Department of Education, not servicers. That means the department would send you emails or letters about your loans, not FedLoan Servicing, Great Lakes, Navient or other servicers.\n\nYou would have access to \u201chigh-quality, one-on-one customer service\u201d on the new federal loan management portal, according to Mitchell\u2019s blog post.\n\nYou would experience a decrease in sudden transfers of your loans to a different servicer, which can be confusing and result in missed payments and changes to repayment benefits, according to the CFPB report.\n\nYou would have a new and potentially more convenient way to make complaints about your servicer to the Department of Education. Currently, borrowers\u2019 best option to submit a student loan complaint is through the CFPB. More than 5,000 grads have done so regarding their private student loans, according to a NerdWallet analysis.\n\nRelated: Here's Why It Takes Women Longer to Pay Off Student Loans\n\nThere\u2019s no date set for the portal to go live; the government isaccepting proposals through May 9, 2016, from contractors interested in helping create it. In the meantime, you can look up which federal student loans you have and who your loan servicer is on the National Student Loan Data System.\n\nWhatever the new portal will look like, advocates say it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cAnything we can do to make things less complicated for borrowers is a great thing,\u201d Mayotte says.\n\nThis piece originally appeared in NerdWallet.
