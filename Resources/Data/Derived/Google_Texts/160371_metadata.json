Speaking to a large crowd of over 8,000 people minutes from the University of Oregon\u2019s campus, Sanders zeroed in on these two goals, offering sharp critiques of both parties.\n\nFirst he lambasted Republicans. \u201cIf you take a hard look at the Republican agenda, it is hard to imagine anybody voting for that agenda,\u201d he said. He criticized the GOP for wanting to give tax breaks to millionaires by repealing the estate tax, neglecting the uninsured by pushing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and abandoning the elderly for voting to cut Medicare and Social Security. From campaign finance to climate change, Sanders threw fire across the aisle.\n\n\u201cI think we are reaching the day when you are going to have members of Congress with patches on their jackets -- sponsored by the Koch bothers, sponsored by Exxon Mobile,\u201d he said.\n\nThen, Sanders turned his aggression on the Democratic Party itself, a party he has only officially called himself a member of for the purposes of this campaign. He blamed low voter turnout across the country on ambiguous platforms from Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party has to reach a fundamental conclusion: Are we on the side of working people or big money interests?\u201d he said. \u201cDo we stand with the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor or Wall Street speculators and the drug companies and the insurance companies?\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party, up to now, has not been clear about which side they are on, on the major issues facing this country,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou cannot be on the side of those workers who have lost their jobs, because of disastrous trade agreements, and support those corporations who have thrown millions of our workers out on the street.\u201d\n\nBeyond pushing specific progressive policy platforms, Sanders brought up more strategic and mechanical issues he believes the party should tackle. He spoke about automatic voter registration, open primaries, and a fifty-state strategy, and accused the party of turning its back on particularly poor states in the South.\n\n\u201cWe need to plant a flag of progressive politics in every state of this country,\u201d he concluded, telling the large crowd that its job was to revitalize American democracy.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "What Sanders' New Stump Speech Says About His Campaign", "description": "Sanders returned to the West Coast for a rally in Oregon.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Sanders returned to the West Coast for a rally in Oregon.", "title": "What Sanders' New Stump Speech Says About His Campaign", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bernie-sanders-stump-speech-campaign/story?id=38759813", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/AP_Sanders_Oregon_jrl_160429_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "Date": "2016-05-01", "twitter": {"description": "Sanders returned to the West Coast for a rally in Oregon.", "title": "What Sanders' New Stump Speech Says About His Campaign", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bernie-sanders-stump-speech-campaign/story?id=38759813", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/AP_Sanders_Oregon_jrl_160429_4x3t_240.jpg", "creator": "@maryaliceparks", "site": "@ABC", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,38759813", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,38759813", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/bernie-sanders-stump-speech-campaign/story?id=38759813"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2016-05-01", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,38759813", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bernie-sanders-stump-speech-campaign/story?id=38759813"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Politics/bernie-sanders-stump-speech-campaign/story?id=38759813", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,38759813", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Last-Modified": "2016-05-01 19:35:57", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "Bernie Sanders, Republican, Democratic Party, Social Security, Medicare, Koch brothers, Affordable Care Act, University of Oregon, Wall Street , politics news, election news, political news, political news articles", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Bernie Sanders, Republican, Democratic Party, Social Security, Medicare, Koch brothers, Affordable Care Act, University of Oregon, Wall Street"}, "article_summary": "Bernie Sanders hit the campaign trail with renewed vigor yesterday -- and a new speech.\nThen, Sanders turned his aggression on the Democratic Party itself, a party he has only officially called himself a member of for the purposes of this campaign.\n\u201cThe Democratic Party has to reach a fundamental conclusion: Are we on the side of working people or big money interests?\u201d he said.\nFrom campaign finance to climate change, Sanders threw fire across the aisle.\n\u201cThe Democratic Party, up to now, has not been clear about which side they are on, on the major issues facing this country,\u201d he continued."}
