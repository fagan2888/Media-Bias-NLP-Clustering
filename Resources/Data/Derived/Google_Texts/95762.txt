While burn bans are official in only four counties (Cotton, Stephens, Canadian, and Pittsburg), outdoor burning is strongly discouraged anywhere in Oklahoma.

Oklahoma's fire danger will be at extreme levels again this afternoon. Red Flag (or, Wildfire) Warnings are in place all across western, central, and northeast Oklahoma. Both Oklahoma City and Tulsa are included in today's fire risk.

Relative Humidity values will drop to 10-25 percent and couple with a warm, dry southwest wind at 15 to 30 mph. These factors will allow fires to start and spread easily across the state.

While burn bans are official in only four counties (Cotton, Stephens, Canadian, and Pittsburg), outdoor burning is strongly discouraged anywhere in Oklahoma, especially in areas under the Red Flag Warning.

Precipitation chances remain absent over the next nine days, keeping our fire risk HIGH. The risk will jump back into the EXTREME category on Thursday when winds will be strong out of the north behind a potent cold front.
