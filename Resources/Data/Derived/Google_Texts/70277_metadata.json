Carson pushed back by posting to social media what he said was a syllabus from the class. However, Carson claimed to have taken the class in 1970, and the syllabus was from 2002.\n\nRelated: Chris Christie Should Be Glad He Was Dropped to the Undercard Debate\n\nHe seemed to score partial points against The Journal, which had called into question Carson\u2019s claim that he was named the \u201cmost honest\u201d student in the class after a hoax in which members of a psychology class were told that their final examinations had been destroyed before they were graded, and that they would need to be retaken.\n\nThe Journal reported finding no record of the hoax, but Carson\u2019s campaign found a story in the Yale Daily News telling how a student prank involving a fake issue of the student newspaper had convinced a handful of psychology students that they would have to retake a final exam. In Carson\u2019s telling, however, the prank had been devised by his professor as a sort of test of moral character that Carson, alone among his classmates, passed.\n\nIn multiple appearances on the weekend\u2019s Sunday political talk shows, the former pediatric neurosurgeon claimed that his background has been subject to unprecedented scrutiny by the media, and blamed it on the \u201csecular progressive movement\u201d in the U.S. that, he said, views him as a threat.\n\nCarson\u2019s claim that he is getting an unheard of level of press attention is something any number of current and former presidential candidates would no doubt be happy to dispute, but there is no denying that he has been battered by multiple negative stories in recent days, generally about claims related to his past that reporters have been unable to corroborate.\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton May Be the Biggest Winner from the Blowout October Jobs Report\n\nHis claims in books and interviews that he turned down admission to West Point, that he sheltered white students during a race riot in Detroit while in high school, that as a young man he was subject to violent and even murderous fits of rage, and more have all come into question as reporters tried to verify them by talking to people who knew Carson at the time, as well as authorities at West Point and Yale.\n\nCarson said the media is convinced that \u201cthere has to be a scandal\u201d and that he is being treated unfairly.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a real scandal, if you\u2019ve got something that\u2019s really important let\u2019s talk about that,\u201d he said. However, in the absence of one, \u201cThere are so many important things that need to be talked about.\u201d\n\nCarson\u2019s chief competitor for the Republican presidential nomination at the moment is billionaire former reality television star Donald Trump, who has not been shy about attacking and ridiculing his opponents throughout the campaign.\n\nRelated: Trump Can\u2019t Keep His Multibillion Dollar Pentagon Programs Straight\n\nOn Sunday, however, across multiple telephone interviews with talk shows, Trump adopted the tone of a concerned colleague, suggesting that he\u2019s genuinely worried about Carson, whom, he said, he has come to consider \u201ca friend.\u201d\n\nOf course, in expressing worry for Carson and a hope that things \u201ccome out great for him\u201d Trump was careful, at each appearance, to meticulously mention almost every one of the issues currently dogging his opponent.\n\nHe dwelled particularly on Carson\u2019s claims, in his autobiography, that before finding religion he was prone to violent outbursts that included attempting to stab a close relative, considering striking his mother in the head with a hammer, and more. He also latched on to the fact that Carson, in the book, used the word \u201cpathological\u201d to describe his violent tendencies.\n\nAgain, adopting a tone of deep concern, Trump said, \u201cHe talked about he had pathological disease. That\u2019s a pretty serous statement when you say you have pathological disease because as I understand it you can\u2019t really cure it.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s dubious medical analysis notwithstanding, it was an effective \u2013 if underhanded \u2013 way of trumpeting his opponent\u2019s weaknesses without appearing to outwardly revel in them, and Carson can probably expect a lot more sympathy from Trump in the weeks to come.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Republican presidential contender Ben Carson struck back on Sunday, with somewhat mixed results, at a barrage of stories from the media suggesting that he had embellished \u2013 or just plain made up \u2013 a number of elements in his otherwise compelling life story.", "title": "As Carson Stumbles, Trump Slowly Turns the Knife", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/08/Carson-Stumbles-Trump-Slowly-Turns-Knife", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-carson-puerto-rico_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/08/Carson-Stumbles-Trump-Slowly-Turns-Knife", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-carson-puerto-rico_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Republican presidential contender Ben Carson struck back on Sunday, with somewhat mixed results, at a barrage of stories from the media suggesting that he had embellished \u2013 or just plain made up \u2013 a number of elements in his otherwise compelling life story.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "However, Carson claimed to have taken the class in 1970, and the syllabus was from 2002.\nHe ripped a Wall Street Journal article in which the reporter claimed that a class given at Yale Carson claimed to have taken in his book Gifted Hands, did not actually exist.\nCarson pushed back by posting to social media what he said was a syllabus from the class.\nCarson said the media is convinced that \u201cthere has to be a scandal\u201d and that he is being treated unfairly.\nHe also latched on to the fact that Carson, in the book, used the word \u201cpathological\u201d to describe his violent tendencies."}
