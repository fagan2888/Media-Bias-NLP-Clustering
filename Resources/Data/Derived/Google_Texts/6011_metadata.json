His history of failed policies and broken promises overshadow his attempt to rewrite the narrative on his presidency\u2019s lack of basic leadership. Instead of working with Congress or the states, he tried to dictate.\n\nObama\u2019s dictates to Congress included, \u201cIf this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, you should finally authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote.\u201d\n\nHe went on to suggest that he will do what he wants with or without Congress. Obama then insinuated that he should be credited for the death of Osama Bin Laden, the death of the al-Qaeda leader in Yemen last year, and the capture of just one perpetrator of the September 11, 2012, Islamic terror attacks on Americans in Yemen.\n\nHe pushed for the closure of the prison at Guantanamo, a campaign promise made to his own supporters that he is now rushing to make happen nearing the end of his presidency.\n\nBreitbart News\u2019s Joel Pollak detailed the top 10 lies in Obama\u2019s State of the Union address. Obama claimed falsely that he had cut deficits by \u201calmost three-quarters\u201d when he has doubled the national debt. Obama claimed the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, was about filling the gaps in employer-based care when the more accurate picture is that \u201cObamacare cancelled insurance coverage for millions of Americans.\u201d Pollak goes on to list several more Obama State of the Union fallacies on climate change, national security, ISIS, and Cuba.\n\nPollak\u2019s list displays just a few of the \u201cmultiple failures\u201d and \u201cbroken promises\u201d Ward is referring to before noting the president\u2019s \u201cattempt to rewrite the narrative on his presidency\u2019s lack of basic leadership.\u201d\n\nWard resigned from her seat in the Arizona State Senate in December to campaign full time. She is dedicated to replacing entrenched Sen. John McCain in the U.S. Senate.\n\nWard, a practicing medical doctor, affirmed to Breitbart News:\n\nI will not drop out of this race under any circumstances. I am running to win and represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate. Anyone who convinces themselves otherwise has mistakenly confused me for a politician.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dr. Kelli Ward weighed in following Obama\u2019s Tuesday evening State of the Union address and highlighted the Obama presidency\u2019s \u201clack of basic leadership.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Dr. Kelli Ward weighed in following Obama\u2019s Tuesday evening State of the Union address and highlighted the Obama presidency\u2019s \u201clack of basic leadership.\u201d", "title": "John McCain Challenger Kelli Ward on SOTU: Obama \u2018Pretending to Be a Leader\u2019 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/dr-kelli-ward-skidmore-flickr.jpg", "height": 960}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/01/13/mccain-challenger-ward-on-sotu-obama-pretending-to-be-a-leader/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dr. Kelli Ward weighed in following Obama\u2019s Tuesday evening State of the Union address and highlighted the Obama presidency\u2019s \u201clack of basic leadership.\u201d", "title": "John McCain Challenger Kelli Ward on SOTU: Obama \u2018Pretending to Be a Leader\u2019 - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/dr-kelli-ward-skidmore-flickr.jpg", "creator": "@michellediana", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Arizona, Congress, doctor, John McCain, kelli ward, SOTU, State of the Union, State Senate, U.S. Senate,Big Government, Obama,Obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-01-13T18:43:54-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/michdimoo", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "U.S. Senate", "categories": "Big Government,Obama"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "His history of failed policies and broken promises overshadow his attempt to rewrite the narrative on his presidency\u2019s lack of basic leadership.\nWard, a practicing medical doctor, affirmed to Breitbart News:I will not drop out of this race under any circumstances.\nTake a vote.\u201dHe went on to suggest that he will do what he wants with or without Congress.\nObama claimed falsely that he had cut deficits by \u201calmost three-quarters\u201d when he has doubled the national debt.\nShe is dedicated to replacing entrenched Sen.
