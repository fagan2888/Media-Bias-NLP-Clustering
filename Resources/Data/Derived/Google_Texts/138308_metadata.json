(NASDAQ: SPAN) announced today that it expects lower consumer bedding sales during the remainder of fiscal 2016 and the first half of fiscal 2017 based on recent competitive changes and an increased emphasis on the Company\u2019s medical products segment.\n\nThe Company expects to transition its largest retail account for consumer bedding products to Sinomax USA, its current distributor for the same account. The account is expected to move to Sinomax in May 2016 and involves the same retail customer that was previously lost in fiscal 2014 and then regained during fiscal 2015. The transition follows Sinomax\u2019s announcement of plans to open a new domestic manufacturing plant for consumer bedding products, and its intent to manufacture these products and sell directly to existing accounts, including the large retail customer.\n\nThe loss of this business to Sinomax is expected to be partially offset by new business from another major retail consumer bedding customer, which is scheduled to begin shipping in May 2016. The new business will include regular day-to-day products as well as back-to-school promotions. Span-America\u2019s sales to the new retail customer are expected to offset approximately 60% of the lost Sinomax business during the last half of fiscal 2016 and approximately 30% of the lost Sinomax business during the first half of fiscal 2017. All of Span-America\u2019s sales of consumer bedding products, except for the Sinomax account, are handled through its marketing and distribution partner, Hollander Sleep Products.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed to lose the Sinomax business, but it provides Span-America with the opportunity to refocus our management\u2019s time and corporate resources on our core medical business that has a more stable long-term growth record,\u201d stated Jim Ferguson, President and CEO of Span-America Medical Systems. \u201cWe recently announced a major contract with the City of Toronto to provide medical bed frames, therapeutic support surfaces and related services to the City\u2019s Long Term Care Homes and Services Division. We believe this shift in our business to the higher margin products in our medical segment will enhance our long-term opportunities to build shareholder value.\u201d\n\nSales to Sinomax for the large retail customer totaled $6.6 million, or 10% of total sales in fiscal 2015. Span-America expects sales of approximately $4.0 million to Sinomax in the first half of fiscal 2016, representing approximately 11% of total sales.\n\nIn an unrelated event, we recently learned that we will not provide consumer bedding products for this year\u2019s fall seasonal promotion to the large retail customer that we previously supplied during the first quarters of fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2016. The customer has notified us that they do not currently plan to include a mattress overlay in the product line-up for this year\u2019s fall seasonal promotion. Although this seasonal business has been a positive contributor to our sales and earnings in the past, profit margins for this business have declined, especially for the most recent promotion.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to actively pursue new consumer business, but we will be more selective in order to improve our profitability and reduce large swings in sales volume from this segment,\u201d stated Mr. Ferguson. \u201cOur long-term focus remains squarely on our core medical business, which is more predictable, has better profit margins and more growth potential. We have an excellent track record of growing this part of our business, and we plan to continue dedicating the large majority of our management\u2019s time and capital resources toward creating opportunities to expand our medical sales.\u201d\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nWe have made forward-looking statements in this release regarding, among other things, our expectations for future sales performance.
