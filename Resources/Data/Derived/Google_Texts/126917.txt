Brian Williams makes sex jokes like the rest of us, and while covering a story about the uptick in births due to the government shutdown nine months ago, he worked in this one — and also burned the federal government.

How long until someone on television points out that during the shutdown the folks in Washington are apparently doing at home what Washington has been accused of doing to the American people? We’re guessing someone will say that on television before long.

Well played, BriWi. Well played.
