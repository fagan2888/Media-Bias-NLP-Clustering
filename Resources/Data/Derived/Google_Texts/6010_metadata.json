He\u2019s always seemed like such a nice, non-crazy guy:\n\nA judge has granted a temporary protective injunction against U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, after his wife filed paperwork accusing the Orlando congressman of shoving and injuring her during an incident this weekend. Lolita Grayson\u2019s petition for the injunction, dated Monday, says her husband pushed her against a door, causing her to fall to the ground, during a confrontation Saturday at their home on Oak Park Road, near Windermere. In a statement, Alan Grayson\u2019s press secretary Lauren Doney wrote that the allegations \u201care absolutely false, completely unfounded, and clearly designed to vilify and harm Congressman Grayson.\u201d The incident comes just less than two months after Lolita Grayson filed a divorce petition stating that their marriage of nearly 24 years was \u201cirretrievably broken.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompletely unfounded,\u201d huh?\n\nPhotos filed by Lolita Grayson\u2019s attorneys with the petition show large bruises to her left leg and left shoulder. Her complaint alleges that, \u201cfrom time to time\u201d in the past, her husband \u201chas battered [her] and the parties\u2019 minor children,\u201d though she has not previously sought an injunction against him\u2026Grayson told his wife, in the presence of their children, that she \u201cwould receive nothing\u201d in their divorce and would be left \u201cin the gutter.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Grayson can commiserate with this charmer. War on women, etc.\n\nUPDATE \u2013 Oh my:\n\nGrayson\u2019s office: Ms. Grayson\u2019s behavior has become increasingly erratic, and she has demonstrated an alarming disconnect from reality. \u2014 Chad Pergram (@ChadPergram) March 4, 2014\n\nAttacking the victim for erratic, unhinged behavior. Consider the source.\n\nUPDATE II \u2013 Of course:\n\nHeadline: \"Florida chapter of National Organization for Women endorses Alan Grayson.\" http://t.co/CG51m53IiO \u2014 Gabriel Malor (@gabrielmalor) March 4, 2014\n\nHe may beat his wife, but at least he supports late-term abortion! Let\u2019s see if this old endorsement survives the current cycle.
