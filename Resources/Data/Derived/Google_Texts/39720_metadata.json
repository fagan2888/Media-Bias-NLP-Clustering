The study reports that people with moderate levels of narcissism succeed only if they don\u2019t manifest the negative aspects of their personality \u2014 something Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli never warned his readers about in his handbook to self-serving tyrannical success, The Prince.\n\nResearchers define narcissism as a personality disorder characterized by an exaggerated sense of self-importance, a lack of empathy, and a need for admiration. These traits often motivate narcissists to do whatever it takes to succeed. The link between narcissism and success goes as far back as Freud's theory that the trait was a normal part of the human psyche, but the University of Illinois researchers weren\u2019t satisfied with research that\u2019s been done on the topic so far. Previous studies have conflicted \u2014 while some say narcissism makes a good leader, others say it breaks one. But the lines may not always be so clear.\n\nIn this study, researchers found that narcissists may emerge as good leaders at the start, but their effectiveness over time is undermined when their peers start to glimpse the off-putting aspects of their personality. \u201cNarcissists tend to be extraverted, and that is leading to the positive relationship between narcissism and leader emergence,\u201d said study lead Emily Grijalva in a news release. \u201cBut you have to keep in mind that although narcissists are likely to emerge as the group leader, over time, the more negative aspects of narcissism tend to emerge.\u201d\n\nGrijalva says narcissists cannot maintain positive, interpersonal relationships with others over a long period of time. Their other negative traits can also include \u201cbeing exploitative, arrogant, and even tyrannical.\u201d It\u2019s all about what study co-author Peter Harms calls a \u201cnice balance\u201d between an ample level of self-confidence and the ability to avoid putting others down to feel good about one\u2019s self.\n\nGrijalva believes the study\u2019s results can shift the focus of discussions in the business world about how to select a good leader.\n\n\u201cInstead of asking whether or not narcissists make good leaders, we are asking how much narcissism it takes to be the ideal leader,\u201d Grijalva said. The researchers' analysis suggests that narcissism is neither fully beneficial nor fully harmful, and a dose of exaggerated self-confidence is \u201cbest in moderation.\u201d\n\nSource: Grijalva E, Harms PD, Newman DA, Gaddis BH, Fraley RC.
