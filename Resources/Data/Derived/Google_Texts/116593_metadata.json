He lives in Iowa City.\n\nLate Night Rumor Mill: Mashable: \"Stephen Colbert is CBS' top choice to replace the retiring David Letterman, and has indicated that he's willing to take over the Late Show when the time comes, people familiar with both sides of the discussions tell Mashable. Colbert has not had any formal contract discussions with CBS, and no agreement is in place, but sources tell Mashable that he first engaged with network executives while Letterman was still mulling the timing of his retirement. Though CBS has had conversations with other candidates, including Colbert's Comedy Central counterpart Jon Stewart, individuals with knowledge of the situation say Colbert is currently the front-and-center candidate. ... Colbert would leave behind the pseudo-conservative persona he's cultivated at The Colbert Report and just be himself at his CBS home, one of the individuals told Mashable.\"\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nXX Factor: Go Ahead, Give David Letterman's Gig to Another White Guy\n\nFrom the Browbeat Archives: The Many White Men of Late Night\n\nWhat Could Have Been: The Hollywood Reporter: \"The pitch was for [John] Oliver potentially to occupy the 12:30 time slot currently filled by The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in the event Ferguson does not re-up his contract at the end of 2014, or possibly for Oliver to launch a different show that would be syndicated by CBS, according to sources. The talks, which ended when Oliver chose in November to host a weekly show on HBO, illustrate the significant challenges CBS faces in remaking its late-night block.... Ferguson has his fans, but he has not emerged as Letterman's heir apparent, because his show is perceived as a more niche chat hour built around his quirky interview style rather than a mainstream variety show that has embraced the digital era, as Jimmy Fallon has at NBC and Jimmy Kimmel at ABC. In addition, the fact that Letterman's Worldwide Pants production company produces with CBS both his Late Show and Ferguson's Late Late Show seemingly gives the network a chance to clean house and rebuild with a new generation of talent, if it chooses to do so.\"\n\nCulturebox: Why Ellen Would Be Perfect in Dave's 11:30pm Slot\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt's Friday, April 4th, welcome to the Slatest PM.
