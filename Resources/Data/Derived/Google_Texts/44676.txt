There were no serious injuries Thursday morning when a Yukon Public Schools bus and a pickup truck with two teenagers inside collided in northwest Oklahoma City.

The crash happened around 7:30 a.m. at Morgan and Hefner Road. The bus was carrying about 40 elementary-school aged children to Surrey Hills Elementary School. Police say it appears the pickup truck turned in front of the school bus.

The crash caused several injuries, none of them serious. The two teens in the pickup were transported to a hospital in good condition. Several of the children on the school bus were treated for cuts, bumps, and bruises but none of them were taken to the hospital.

After hearing of the crash, several parents rushed to the scene to pickup their children. Another school bus was also sent to the collision site to transport the uninjured kids to school. The superintendent of the Yukon school district was also at the scene, making sure everyone was okay.
