Down from 337 in 2004. ER\u2019s per capita: 6.7 per million, lowest ratio in U.S. Patients: 12.45 million in 2013, up from 9.1 million in 2004. Patients treated and released: 86% Patients admitted: 14% (55% of all hospital admissions) How patients pay: Private insurance (30%), Medi-Cal (30%), Medicare (17%), uninsured (15%), other (7%). Sources: California Office of Statewide Planning & Development, American College of Emergency Physicians\n\nCalifornians, especially those in Los Angeles County, endure longer waits in hospital emergency rooms than most Americans. There is scant evidence that the situation will get better anytime soon.\n\nIf you go to an ER for a fever or broken bone or other urgent complaint, chances are that you\u2019ll spend more than 21/2 hours inside \u2014 23 minutes longer than the national wait. That\u2019s according to statistics compiled in 2013 by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nAnd if a doctor decides you must be admitted to the hospital, your wait will stretch even longer: Roughly 5 hours and 18 minutes from arrival to the decision to admit you, and nearly 2 hours more until a nurse or orderly tucks you into your bed.\n\nThe waits are especially long at hospitals serving low-income patients in Los Angeles County. During 2013, ER patients at LA County-Olive View-UCLA Medical Center in Sylmar waited about 7 hours and 28 minutes from arrival to release \u2014 longest in the state and second-longest in the nation behind Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta.\n\nAt 20 of the state\u2019s ER\u2019s the wait was so unbearable that at least 5 percent of the patients gave up and walked out before they could be treated.\n\nThe emergency room is the one cog in the health care system that cannot turn away a patient.\n\nER traffic has soared by 37 percent in the past decade, five times the state\u2019s population growth. Nearly a third of the patients flocking to ER\u2019s are on Medi-Cal, the state-federal program for low-income residents. Because of low reimbursement rates to doctors, Medi-Cal patients often go to the ER when they can\u2019t see their doctors.\n\nIn addition, hospital managers now expect their ER\u2019s to act as gatekeepers, deciding whom to admit as inpatients and performing an array of tests before these patients land in a room. Last year 55 percent of California hospital inpatients came through the ER. A decade ago, just 40 percent did.\n\nER traffic grows and with it the waits, because of \u201ca lack of access to other, alternative sources of care,\u201d said Ted Chan, emergency medicine chair at UC San Diego.\n\nWaiting does more than prolong patients\u2019 suffering. Studies show that long ER waits lead to deaths and to more frequent hospital admissions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly inhumane,\u201d said Michael Menchine, an emergency physician at County-USC Medical Center and an associate professor at USC Keck School of Medicine. \u201cThis wouldn\u2019t be such a problem if crowding occurred 1 percent of the time. ... But it\u2019s all the time now.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nER managers are trying to reduce the waits.\n\nAt Olive View, waits have declined from a peak of roughly 8 hours at one point in early 2013 according to internal records to less than 6 hours this year. Scott Lundberg, an emergency physician and clinical director at Olive View, attributed the reduction to a 10 percent drop in demand, better access to primary care, improved triage of patients in the ER and electronic records.\n\nBut \u201cwe\u2019re not pleased with the long cycle times,\u201d Lundberg said. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to bring it down.\u201d\n\nDespite the addition of thousands of new ER beds over the past decade, emergency physicians have been unable to keep up.\n\nOne important reason: \u201cboarders\u201d \u2014 the word emergency physicians use for patients who have been admitted from the ER to the hospital but who haven\u2019t yet been assigned a bed.\n\nHospital bed space has not kept up with the big increase in ER traffic. During the past decade, California hospitals have expanded licensed beds by just 1 percent.\n\nIt can take hours to find a bed for a boarder, and in the meantime he or she takes away space from other ER patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had physicians chomping at the bit waiting to see patients, but there were no empty rooms,\u201d said Michael L. Callaham, chair of emergency medicine at UC San Francisco.\n\n\u201cThere will be days when literally half the beds are consumed by people waiting to go upstairs (to the hospital),\u201d said James Dunford Jr., emeritus emergency medicine professor at UC San Diego.\n\nThe situation becomes far worse if the boarder is a psychiatric patient.\n\nUnlike an ordinary boarder, a psychiatric boarder requires constant staff attention and more ER resources, Dunford said.\n\n\u201cAnd really,\u201d Dunford added, \u201cthe emergency department is about the worst place you could put a psychiatric patient.\u201d It\u2019s noisy and crowded; a psychiatric patient needs quiet.\n\nAt UC San Diego\u2019s two hospitals, doctors try to move psychiatric patients from the ER to hospital beds within two days. But the situation is worse elsewhere because of the scarcity of psychiatric beds in California.\n\nCallaham\u2019s personal record for a psychiatric boarder is a week.\n\nA second reason for the long waits in ER\u2019s is that patients are \u2014 or at least appear to be \u2014 sicker than they once were. A decade ago, ER\u2019s classified 30 percent of their patients as severe or critical, the top categories. By 2013, 41 percent were in those groups. A lack of space in intensive care wards is a big contributing factor.\n\n\u201cThe ER\u2019s increasingly are taking care of critically ill people because there\u2019s no place to put them,\u201d Dunford said.\n\nFor years many hospital administrators treated ER\u2019s as loss leaders or worse, money pits.\n\nThat helps explain why the number of ER\u2019s in California has declined slightly over the past decade.\n\n\u201cGenerally the assumption has been that the emergency room is a magnet for the underserved, nonpaying population,\u201d said Dylan Roby, a health policy economist at UCLA.\n\nA 1986 federal law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, requires emergency rooms to stabilize patients without inquiring into their ability to pay. The law was designed to prevent private hospitals from \u201cdumping\u201d uninsured patients on public hospitals. It provided no money.\n\nSince its passage, hundreds of ER\u2019s, including dozens in California, have closed.\n\nUninsured patients make up about 15 percent of ER patients statewide but a much bigger share at some hospitals. At Olive View, the hospital with the record waiting times, uninsured patients make up 63 percent of ER patients, second highest in the state.\n\nAlthough Congress in 1986 opened the ER door to uninsured patients, researchers concluded that most rarely go.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest impediments to going to an emergency department is that you get a bill,\u201d said USC\u2019s Menchine.\n\nMost of the uninsured are working poor, he said. A visit to the ER can cost $3,000, and if you\u2019re working poor, you\u2019ll spend the next four years paying that bill, he said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act may change the equation, both for hospitals and for patients.\n\nFor ER\u2019s that treated many uninsured patients, \u201ca lot of that risk goes away,\u201d said Roby, the health policy economist. \u201cYou\u2019re at least getting some money for the services coming in through the emergency room.\u201d\n\nHe said it should be clear within a couple of years whether the law will make a difference for hospitals that have been on the financial edge.\n\nWhat the law will mean for ER patients, both long insured and newly insured, is unclear.\n\nAlready, Menchine said, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing an increase in ER visits. We\u2019re seeing people who are newly insured, ... but it\u2019s Medicaid.\u201d\n\nThe state-federal Medicaid program, known in California as Medi-Cal, typically pays providers no more than 25 percent of what they charge. As a result, patients have a difficult time getting appointments even once they sign up with a doctor. So Medi-Cal patients tend to rely on the ER because they know they can always get served.\n\nIt will take years for those newly insured patients to adjust to having primary care doctors and escape reliance on ER\u2019s, Mechine said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost generational,\u201d he said.\n\nThe CHCF Center for Health Reporting partners with the Los Angeles News Group on health care issues.
