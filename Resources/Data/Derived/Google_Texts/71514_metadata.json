People ask me how long Ive been with B&B and I tell them that, for the second time, it\u2019s going on 44 years.\u201d\n\nNext month, he\u2019ll be inducted into the third Hall of Fame Class of the Mississippi Concrete Industries Association.\n\nHe\u2019ll be joined by friends, family and colleagues at B&B, including company co-founder Henry Brevard Jr., who was inducted in the first Hall of Fame class in 2013.\n\n\u201cHaving spent most of my life in the concrete-related business most of my life, and most of it with B&B Concrete, it\u2019s a surprise and honor to be acknowledged by your peers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very humbling.\u201d\n\nGetting started\n\nA 1966 civil engineering graduate from Mississippi State University, Waters didn\u2019t go to work for B&B Concrete right away. Instead he got a job for IBM as a computer systems engineer, working closely with banks.\n\nBut he did spend a little more time with B&B before going to work for IBM.\n\n\u201cThere was a two-week gap between the time I graduated and when I started with IBM, and I was flat broke,\u201d he said. \u201cSo as an engineering graduate from Mississippi State, my first job immediately after college was driving a truck for B&B Concrete. Mr. Brevard and David (Henry\u2019s son) love me when I tell that story, because they both went to Ole Miss. We get a good laugh out of it.\u201d\n\nWaters has always been close to the Brevards.\n\nAnd the feeling is mutual.\n\n\u201cWe consider Bill to be a part of our family,\u201d said David Brevard. \u201cWe love Bill and his family.\u201d\n\nThe elder Brevard took a liking to Waters early on, taking notice of his work ethic and the attention to detail.\n\n\u201cHe liked the way I cleaned his car at my uncle\u2019s service station,\u201d Waters said. \u201cI worked there on Saturday, and he\u2019d come in every week. He liked the job I did there and offered me a job at B&B.\u201d\n\nIn those early years, Waters worked in the yard, driving the front-end loader, batched concrete and did whatever was necessary.\n\n\u201cIt was a great experience,\u201d he said.\n\nAt IBM, Waters picked up extensive knowledge of accounting and finance during his work with banks. As an engineer, he wasn\u2019t well-versed in the areas, but the experience proved invaluable, Waters said.\n\nIn 1972, B&B came looking for him.\n\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be back,\u201d he said. \u201cBut during those years with IBM, whenever I was ever back in Tupelo, I\u2019d try to see Mr Brevard at least once or twice a year. Late in 1971, I was visiting him here and he shut the door and asked if I\u2019d ever consider coming back and working for B&B because he had some expansion plans.\u201d\n\nAfter months of thinking about the new job that was being developed at B&B, and thinking about where to raise and educate his young children, Waters decided to come back to the All-America City.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never regretted coming back,\u201d he said. \u201cI was born and raised in Tupelo, and it\u2019s a great place to raise four children. They went to the schools here, and they went on to State, Ole Miss and Millsaps. So we spread it around nicely.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s success\n\nToday, Waters is the vice president of B&B, where he plays a major role in the company. He\u2019s also the company\u2019s engineer.\n\n\u201cBill is the only non-family member who is a shareholder, officer, director and executive committee member for our family company,\u201d explained David Brevard. \u201cThis status is the strongest, clear reflection of our confidence, trust, respect and gratitude for Bill and his significant contribution to the success of our family company.\u201d\n\nWaters says his success has been driven and influenced by the Brevards.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s work ethic I learned from them,\u201d he sad. \u201cAnd I\u2019m working with ethical, first-class people who believe that a job should be done first-rate in a timely manner. Quality and customer service are a key part of that as well. And they treat me like family.\u201d\n\nDavid Brevard said Waters has the strong analytical mind of an engineer and can crunch numbers. But he said Waters does more than that.\n\n\u201cHe also has the ability to consider and think through the qualitative factors which need to be considered in making a good reasoned decision on many business matters,\u201d Brevard said. \u201cBill has good, reasoned judgment. In addition he has a lot of wisdom about our business and our industry. He has the respect, goodwill and active support of our employees, our customers, members of the engineering and architectural community and officials with public entities such as the Mississippi Department of Transportation.\u201d\n\nBrevard said Waters is a valued \u201csounding board\u201d and a go-to confidant as well.\n\n\u201cWe have been blessed with many capable, conscientious, hardworking and valuable employees,\u201d he added. \u201cB&B has survived and succeeded for 66 years of business operations as a result of the individual and combined efforts of a great team of employees past and present, and we believe continuing into the future. Accordingly, it is dangerous to single out any individual employee for special recognition, but just like the selection of Bill for the MCIA Hall of Fame, if B&B were to have an employee Hall of Fame, Bill Waters would be included. He is special.\u201d\n\ndennis.seid@journalinc.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal", "description": "By Dennis Seid Daily Journal TUPELO \u2013 For 66 years, B&B Concrete has been a household name in north Mississippi, with ready-mix concrete plants dotting the landscape.
