This was touted as a way to prevent D.C. from being able to actually put the law in action.\n\nBut, the New York Times reported, the wording of the provision and its delayed timing might mean that D.C. officials can move forward despite the order.\n\n\u201cThe marijuana law, lawyers here argue, had already been enacted and certified by the Board of Elections before Congress passed the spending bill, so there was no \u201cenacting\u201d for the House to prevent. \u201cThe issue becomes: What does enactment mean?\u201d said David Zvenyach the city\u2019s general counsel. Like other officials here, he believes that the city got ahead of Congress in enacting its law, which it intends to start carrying out this spring. \u201cTheir language was either careless or hasty,\u201d said Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat and the district\u2019s nonvoting delegate to the House. \u201cIf you are working on an amendment to an appropriation bill, you better be really careful. They say we shan\u2019t enact. Well, we don\u2019t have to enact anything.\u201d\n\nIf D.C. uses this loophole then Congress would have to do a \u201cformal disapproval\u201d of the law by March, according to the Times, which would require a joint congressional resolution signed by the president. This has only happened three times since the city was granted home rule in 1973.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s budget plan also amended language in the spending bill so that it only prohibited the use of federal funds for enacting the marijuana law. This would free up the city to use its own dollars for their legalization efforts.\n\nRep. Rob Woodall (R-Ga.) told Red Alert Politics Tuesday that the reason Congressional Republicans have taken issue with the D.C. law is because it asks them to ignore federal law.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t like federal law, let\u2019s change federal law. The president has taken us down this road so many times. Where he has a law, he doesn\u2019t like the law, but instead of changing the law, he just ignores the law. That\u2019s true on marijuana. It\u2019s true on the delay of the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s true on his recess appointments and it\u2019s true on his immigration proposals. That is not the way the way this country is able to be run and it\u2019s not what the Constitution allows,\u201d Woodall said.\n\n\u201cDo I take seriously the Constitutional responsibility that Congress has to run the District of Columbia? I do. I would not expect Congress to abdicate that responsibility. Do I believe that we need to look at changing some federal laws? I absolutely do.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "(AP Photo/The Oregonian, Beth Nakamura) District of Columbia officials believe they may have found a way to make sure their voters had a voice last November, using a loophole to go around a Congressional attempt to block the legalization of marijuana in D.C.
