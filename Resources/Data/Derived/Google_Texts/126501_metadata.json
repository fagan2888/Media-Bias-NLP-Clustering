Domestically produced energy is a national security issue, he said, adding, \u201cIf we can keep one dollar from going to people who are killing our kids in Afghanistan, it\u2019s a good thing \u2014 and I feel that\u2019s what solar energy does.\u201d\n\nHe and others consider the utilities to be regulated monopolies whose rates are set by bureaucrats \u2014 the opposite of a free-market economy. In Georgia, Debbie Dooley, the national coordinator for Tea Party Patriots and a co-founder of the Green Tea Coalition, said the fact that some conservatives denounced the favorable treatment that solar power got from the federal government was immaterial.\n\n\u201cThey neglect to mention billions of dollars that the fossil-fuel industries have received,\u201d she said. \u201cThey cherry-pick their principles.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\nSeth Gunning, an organizer in Georgia with the Sierra Club\u2019s Beyond Coal campaign who teamed up with Ms. Dooley, said that although ideals differ, \u201cwe can find common ground.\u201d Ms. Dooley said she was working with pro-solar activists in Colorado, South Carolina, Florida, Virginia, Ohio and Texas. \u201cIt\u2019s spreading,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople respond to free-market energy.\u201d\n\nShe said that in the work with Mr. Gunning and other activists on the left, everyone tried to keep things civil. \u201cWe just don\u2019t talk about Obamacare,\u201d she said.\n\nSometimes she will call Mr. Gunning a tree-hugger. Her liberal partners \u201ccall me a \u2018right-wing radical.\u2019 But we\u2019ll joke about it,\u201d Ms. Dooley said. \u201cWe\u2019re on each other\u2019s Christmas card list.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn Hawaii, where high electricity costs have led to enormous private investment in rooftop solar panels, State Representative Cynthia Thielen, a Republican, in cooperation with the local Sierra Club chapter, has been battling Hawaiian Electric over policies that she says discourage adoption of solar power. Like other utilities, Hawaiian Electric has argued that the boon in solar has put a strain on the grid and could even cause safety problems.\n\nThe fight in Arizona led to a vote in November that allowed both sides to claim victory. The all-Republican commission that regulates utilities voted for an average fee of $5 per month, much lower than the original request from the utility, but accepted the utilities\u2019 argument that solar subsidies are inappropriately disrupting their bottom line.\n\nIn many states, the conflict focuses on so-called net metering subsidies that utilities give rooftop solar owners for the excess energy they feed back onto the grid \u2014 an important incentive for consumers to adopt solar power. As solar power has boomed, the companies have argued that customers who put solar panels on their roofs might be shifting the cost of maintaining the energy grid to nonsolar ratepayers.\n\nIn any case, the rise of solar, like other forms of independent power generation, has caused headaches for the industry.\n\nLisa Wood, vice president of the Edison Foundation, a nonprofit group in Washington sponsored by investor-owned utilities, argued that for the typical residential customer, the cost of making the electricity accounted for only about 45 percent of the bill. Most of the rest was distribution, transmission and maintenance of equipment that might be called on for only part of the year, when demand was high. Her argument that rooftop solar users shift costs to other ratepayers pits homeowners against apartment dwellers and those who do not have the kind of credit rating that the solar companies like to do business with.\n\nDavid Leeper, an electrical engineer and solar rooftop user in Phoenix, ridiculed the power industry\u2019s arguments as \u201chigh-tech chutzpah.\u201d Mr. Leeper, a Republican who cites his core values as \u201climited government, free markets and fiscal responsibility,\u201d said the notion that he was some kind of free rider made him wonder whether he should owe the utility money if he conserved energy by using his air conditioner more sparingly. \u201cDoes that mean I took money from them?\u201d\n\nBut he said he was satisfied with the vote for a small monthly charge since he needs the power grid to reliably provide power in the evenings, or when clouds pass across the face of the sun.\n\n\u201cI owe you guys something for being there when I need you,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the fee for backup service.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140125214525, "twitter": {"description": "Solar power is dividing conservatives who support
