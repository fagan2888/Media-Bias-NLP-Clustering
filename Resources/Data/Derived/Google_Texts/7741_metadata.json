After growing up during the Great Recession, millennials want to keep every cent they can. (If you don\u2019t believe us, just check out this Reddit Frugal thread inspired by our recent post on millennial retirement super-saving.)\n\nThis generation may be way ahead of where their parents were at the same age when it comes to preparing for retirement, but the frugality doesn\u2019t end there. Kids these days also aren\u2019t making the same buying decisions our parents made. Here are 10 things that a disproportionate number of today\u2019s young adults won\u2019t shell out for.\n\n1. Pay TV\n\nThe average American still consumes 71% of his or her media on television, but for people age 14-24, it\u2019s only 46%\u2014with the lion\u2019s share being consumed on phone, tablet, or PC. Many young people aren\u2019t getting a TV at all. Nielsen found that most \u201cZero-TV\u201d households tended toward the younger set, with adults under 35 making up 44% of all television teetotalers.\n\nMillennials aren\u2019t the only ones tuning out the tube. In 2013, Nielsen reported aggregate TV watching time shrank for the first time in four years.\n\nRead next: 7 Streaming TV Packages That Will Let You Cut Cable For Good\n\n2. Investments\n\nBy all accounts, young people should be investing in equities. Those just entering the work force have plenty of time before retirement to ride out market blips, and experts recommend younger investors place 75% to 90% of their portfolio in stocks or stock funds.\n\nUnfortunately, after growing up in the Great Recession, millennials would rather put their money in a sock drawer than on Wall Street. When Wells Fargo surveyed roughly 1,500 adults between 22 and 32 years of age, 52% stated they were \u201cnot very\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d confident in the stock market as a place to invest for retirement.\n\nOf those surveyed, only 32% said they had the majority of their savings in stocks or mutual funds. (Too be fair, an equal number admitted to having no clue what they were invested in, so hopefully their trust fund advisors are making good decisions.)\n\nRead next: Here\u2019s the Best Way to Invest in a Roth IRA in Your 20s\n\n3. Mass-Market Beer\n\nBud. Coors. Miller. When parents want a drink, they reach for the classics. Maybe a Heineken for a little extra adventure. Millennials? Not so much. When Generation Now (thank god that moniker didn\u2019t catch on) wants to get boozy, the data says we prefer indie brews.\n\nAccording to one recent study, 43% of millennials say craft beer tastes better than mainstream beers, while only 32% of baby boomers said the same. And 50% of millennials have consumed craft brew, versus 35% of the overall population. Even Pete Coors, CEO of guess-which-brand, blames pesky kids for his beer\u2019s declining sales.\n\nRead next: 5 Great Things That Beer Has Done for the U.S. Economy\n\n4. Cars\n\nBack when the Beach Boys wrote Little Deuce Coupe in 1963, there was a whole genre called \u201cCar Songs.\u201d Nowadays you\u2019d be hard pressed to find someone under 35 who knows what a \u201ccompetition clutch with the four on the floor\u201d even means.\n\nThe sad fact is that American car culture is dying a slow death. Yahoo Finance reports the percentage of 16-to-24-year-olds with a driver\u2019s license has plummeted since 1997 and is now below 70% for the first time since Little Deuce Coupe\u2019s release. According to the Atlantic, \u201cIn 2010, adults between the ages of 21 and 34 bought just 27 percent of all new vehicles sold in America, down from the peak of 38 percent in 1985.\u201d\n\n5. Homes\n\nIt\u2019s not that millennials don\u2019t want to own homes\u2014nine in ten young people do\u2014it\u2019s that they can\u2019t afford them. Harvard\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies found that homeownership rate among adults younger than 35 fell by 12 percent between 2006 and 2011, and 2 million more were living with Mom and Dad.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a while before young people start purchasing homes again. The economic downturn set this generation\u2019s finances back years, and reforms like the Dodd-Frank Act have made it even more difficult for the newly employed to get credit. Now that unemployment is decreasing, working millennials are still renting before they buy.\n\nRead next: Why Millennials Are Better Off Waiting 10 Years to Buy a Home\n\n6. Bulk Warehouse Club Goods\n\nThis one initially sounds weird, but remember: millennials don\u2019t own cars or homes. So a Costco membership doesn\u2019t make much sense. It\u2019s not easy to bring home a year\u2019s supply of Nesquik and paper towels without a ride, and even if you take a bus, there\u2019s no room to stash hoards of kitchen supplies in a studio apartment.\n\nResponding to tepid millennial demand, the big box giant is trying to win over youngsters by partnering with Google to deliver certain items right to your home. However, even Costco doesn\u2019t seem all that excited about its new strategy.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t expect us to go to everybody\u2019s doorstep,\u201d Richard Galanti, Costco\u2019s chief financial officer, told Bloomberg Businessweek. \u201cDelivering small quantities of stuff to homes is not free. Ultimately, somebody\u2019s got to pay for it.\u201d\n\n7. Weddings\n\nGetting hitched early in life used to be something of a rite of passage into adulthood. A full 65% of the Silent Generation married at age 18 to 32. Since then, though, Americans have been waiting longer and longer to tie the knot. Pew Research found 48% of boomers were married while in that age range, compared to 35% in Gen X. Millennials are bringing up the rear at just 26%.\n\nJust like with homes, it\u2019s not that today\u2019s youth just hates wedding dresses\u2014far from it. Sixty-nine percent of millennials told Pew they would like to marry, but many are waiting until they\u2019re more financially stable before doing so.\n\n8. Children\n\nIt\u2019s hard to spend money on children if you don\u2019t have any.\n\nAfter weddings, you probably saw this one coming, but millennials\u2019 procreation abstention isn\u2019t only because they\u2019re not married. Many just aren\u2019t planning on having kids. In a 2012 study, fewer than half of millennials (42%) said they planned to have children. That\u2019s down from 78% 20 years ago.\n\nStop me if you heard this one: it\u2019s not that millennials don\u2019t want children (or homes, or weddings, or ponies), it\u2019s that this whole recession thing has really scared them off any big financial or life commitments. Most young people in the above study hoped to have kids one day, but didn\u2019t think their economic stars would align to make it happen.\n\nRead next: 6 Ways to Help Your Adult Kids Without Spending a Dime\n\n9. Health insurance\n\nAccording the Kaiser Family Foundation, adults ages 18 to 34 made up 40% of the uninsured population in the pre-Obamacare world. Why don\u2019t young people get health coverage? Because they\u2019re probably not going to get sick. This demographic is so healthy that those in the health insurance game refer to them as \u201cinvincibles.\u201d\n\nSince the Affordable Care Act, more millennials are gradually buying insurance. Twenty-eight percent of Obamacare\u2019s 8 million new enrollees were 18-34 year-olds. That\u2019s well short of the 40% the Congressional Budget Office wanted in order to subsidize older Americans\u2019 plans, but better than the paltry number of millennials who signed up before Zach Galifianakis got involved.\n\nRead next: What Is Obamacare?\n\n10. Anything you tell them to buy\n\nWhen buying a product, older Americans tend to trust the advice of people they know. Sixty-six percent of boomers said the recommendations of friends and family members influences their purchasing decisions more than a stranger\u2019s online review.\n\nMost millennials, on the other hand, don\u2019t want their parent\u2019s or peer\u2019s help. Fifty-one percent of young adults say they prefer product reviews from people they don\u2019t know.\n\nRead next: 10 Things Americans Have Suddenly Stopped Buying", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "By 2017, millennials will have more buying power than any other generation.
