It doesn\u2019t make you Islamophobic,\u201d Ali said to cheers Friday at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC. \u201cIf we want to name the enemy and understand the threat, then \u2026 we the people have to educate ourselves on exactly what the threat is.\u201d\n\nThe Somalia-born Ali, who renounced her Muslim faith, became an atheist, and gained political office in the Netherlands, said it is important for Americans to understand that Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, established Islam as both a religion and a political doctrine.\n\nWhen Muhammad founded Islam in Mecca, leading to the birth of the Quran, Ali said, he did so with religious intentions. But when he moved to Medina and developed a constitution, she said, it was for political motivations.\n\n\u201cThat doctrine of Muhammad\u2019s in Medina is the antithesis of the idea of America, the American philosophy, and American political theory,\u201d she said, adding:\n\nNot every single Muslim is a threat\u2014millions and millions and millions of Muslims are peace-loving. But those Muslims who invoke the Prophet Muhammad in his legacy in Medina and in his creeds, those are the threat to us on a personal level\u2014as a woman, as those who refuse to be the way they want you to be, as Muslims who refuse to emulate Muhammad, as citizens of the world.\n\nAli, a naturalized U.S. citizen and author of the book \u201cHeretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now,\u201d warned against labeling radical Islamic terrorists \u201clone wolves,\u201d instead calling them state actors who organize internationally.\n\nWhile Ali said her intelligence is insulted when American leaders tell her that Islam is a religion of peace, she stressed the importance of recognizing that not all Muslims are jihadists.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there are people more desperate for peace today than those who identify as Muslim,\u201d Ali said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cWe the people have to educate ourselves on exactly what the threat is.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cWe the people have to educate ourselves on exactly what the threat is.\"", "title": "Former Muslim: Not 'Islamophobic' to Discuss Islam's Ideas", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160304_RadicalIslam_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-22T09:16:14+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1UG0NTJ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cWe the people have to educate ourselves on exactly what the threat is.\"", "title": "Former Muslim: Not 'Islamophobic' to Discuss Islam's Ideas", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160304_RadicalIslam_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2016-03-04T19:15:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-22T09:16:14+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ayaan Hirsi Ali, radical Islam, Islamic terrorism, Prophet Muhammad, Mecca, Islam, ISIS, CPAC, Conservative Political Action Conference"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI don\u2019t think there are people more desperate for peace today than those who identify as Muslim,\u201d Ali said.\n\u201cTo discuss Islam as a set of ideas does not make you a racist.\nIt doesn\u2019t make you Islamophobic,\u201d Ali said to cheers Friday at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC.\nWhen Muhammad founded Islam in Mecca, leading to the birth of the Quran, Ali said, he did so with religious intentions.\nBut when he moved to Medina and developed a constitution, she said, it was for political motivations."}
