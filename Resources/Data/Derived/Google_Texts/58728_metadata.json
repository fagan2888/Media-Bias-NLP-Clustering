Better-informed patients, they say, are more likely to take better care of themselves, comply with prescription drug regimens and even detect early-warning signals of illness, as Mr. Keating did.\n\nBut there is another big potential benefit of the wider use and sharing of patient information \u2014 medical research. Mr. Keating himself calls it a \u201chuge crowdsourcing opportunity for research.\u201d Not surprisingly, he has offered up his own data for several research projects.\n\nResearch organizations are beginning to look at the opportunity in new ways as well. Traditionally, patient information has been tapped for research in large pooled databases. Individual contributions only made it in as part of these centralized efforts. That is still the norm, but change is coming. Institutional practice, individual attitudes and new technology are the reasons.\n\nOne technical tool that could push things along is Apple\u2019s ResearchKit, which was introduced last month. The open-source software in ResearchKit would let medical researchers write applications to recruit subjects and collect their data from their iPhones or iPhone-linked fitness monitors, like the FitBit or Apple Watch.\n\nNew technology and the rise of the Facebook information-sharing culture have prompted researchers to rethink the patient asset in science. Dr. Stephen Friend is president of Sage Bionetworks, a nonprofit organization that advocates open-data policies. Until a few years ago, he said, he saw efforts to share patient data as mainly a step to get people more engaged in their own health, but not something that could improve medical research.\n\nToday, Dr. Friend said, his perspective is very different. \u201cThe patient, doctor and researcher \u2013 each is a different kind of expert,\u201d he said. The promise, Dr. Friend said, is to \u201cdemocratize medical discovery.\u201d\n\nThe patient information can be medical documents, lab results, and biometric or activity data from smartphones or wearable devices. But Dr. Friend said it could also be more subjective information, like health apps in which people report how they feel or social network conversations about health.\n\nThen, by mining the reports with analysis software, Dr. Friend said, \u201cYou can turn anecdotes into signals, unpacking the dimensions of disease and what makes people feel better. That\u2019s what big data analysis is seeking to do.\u201d\n\nThe journey from health to disease, Dr. Friend explained, is not a single step but a progression. Aggregated patient data, he said, could well provide insights on how to stave off chronic ailments like diabetes and heart disease. \u201cThat\u2019s potentially what this kind of citizen science can uncover \u2014 how to be resilient to disease,\u201d he said.\n\nReluctance to share personal health information is declining, and not only for cultural reasons. A prevalent fear, said Ben Heywood, co-founder and president of PatientsLikeMe, an online discussion and research forum, has been that if a person disclosed an illness, it might be more difficult to obtain health insurance. But the Affordable Care Act bans discrimination by insurers based on so-called pre-existing conditions. \u201cThe biggest deterrent has been removed by law,\u201d Mr. Heywood said.\n\nBut concerns remain, especially about privacy, given the sensitive nature of medical information. One of the research projects Mr. Keating plans to share his data with is the Personal Genome Project at Harvard. The file of a person\u2019s DNA fingerprint need not bear a name to identify its owner.\n\nIn its risks and benefits page, the project lists the benefits as contributing to a cause that advances science and satisfying personal curiosity. On the risk side, it states that in principle someone with scientific skills could use a person\u2019s genome to infer paternity, generate statistical evidence that might hurt a person\u2019s chances of getting a job, insurance or loans, and make synthetic DNA to plant at a crime scene.\n\nIn agreeing to the terms of the Human Genome Project, \u201cyou do sign off a lot,\u201d said Mr. Keating, who is doing so without hesitation.\n\nRelated", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150402053057, "BN": "bits", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "technology/bits", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/bits/post", "per": "Friend, Stephen H;Keating, Steven (1988- )", "org": "Sage Bionetworks", "keywords": "Friend Stephen H,Keating Steven (1988- ),Electronic Health Records,Research,Sage Bionetworks,Big Data", "GBLC": "Big Data", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/bits/Using Patient Data to Democratize Medical Discovery ( 20150402 )", "news_keywords": "Electronic health record,Research,Sage Bionetworks,Stephen Friend,Steven Keating", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Steve Lohr", "SCG": "bits", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Steve Lohr", "byl": "Steve Lohr", "twitter": {"description": "Scientists say that sharing and mining patient information could accelerate the pace of medical discovery.", "title": "Using Patient Data to Democratize Medical Discovery", "url": "http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/using-patient-data-to-democratize-medical-discovery/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/04/01/technology/01bits-friend/01bits-friend-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@nytimesbits", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000003607424, "description": "Scientists say that sharing and mining patient information could accelerate the pace of medical discovery.", "CG": "Technology", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "April 2, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1427967057, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/steve_lohr/index.html", "section": "Technology", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/technology/index.jsonp", "tag": "Big Data", "modified_time": "2015-04-03T19:07:00-04:00"}, "utime": 20150403190700, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150402, "pdate": 20150402, "des": "Electronic Health Records;Research", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/04/01/technology/01bits-friend/01bits-friend-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bits Blog", "description": "Scientists say that sharing and mining patient information could accelerate the pace of medical discovery.", "title": "Using Patient Data to Democratize Medical Discovery", "url": "http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/using-patient-data-to-democratize-medical-discovery/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/04/01/technology/01bits-friend/01bits-friend-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/using-patient-data-to-democratize-medical-discovery/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Using Patient Data to Democratize Medical Discovery", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/04/01/technology/01bits-friend/01bits-friend-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "April 2, 2015"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce240\"", "article_summary": "But there is another big potential benefit of the wider use and sharing of patient information \u2014 medical research.\nFriend said, is to \u201cdemocratize medical discovery.\u201dThe patient information can be medical documents, lab results, and biometric or activity data from smartphones or wearable devices.\nAggregated patient data, he said, could well provide insights on how to stave off chronic ailments like diabetes and heart disease.\nBut concerns remain, especially about privacy, given the sensitive nature of medical information.\nOne of the research projects Mr. Keating plans to share his data with is the Personal Genome Project at Harvard."}
