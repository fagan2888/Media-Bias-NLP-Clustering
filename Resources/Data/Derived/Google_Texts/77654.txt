The insurance company CoOportunity Health has shifted leadership, with Cliff Gold taking over the chief executive officer job from David Lyons.

Lyons, who is a former Iowa insurance commissioner, will continue to serve on the organization's board.

Gold helped Lyons found the company in 2010 and was its chief operating officer. He previousley retired after a long career as an executive at Wellmark Blue Cross & Blue Shield, which dominates Iowa's health insurance market.

CoOportunity, based in West Des Moines, is a cooperative, member-owned company set up with millions of dollars in seed money from the federal Affordable Care Act. It has 93,000 members in Iowa and Nebraska, Gold said today.

Gold, 61, said the founders always planned on having three phases. The first was designing the effort and applying to become an approved co-op. The second was setting up the company. The third is operating it. "We've moved into the operational phase," he said.

Lyons, who could continue to work as a consultant, will focus on turning the company's board into one controlled by co-op members who are elected by other members, as required by the new federal law, Gold said. Gold will focus on running the company.

CoOportunity has been hailed as one of the most successful of the 23 such health-insurance co-ops organized nationally. It is one of two main insurance carriers selling policies on the new online public insurance exchange, which is a key part of the Affordable Care Act.
