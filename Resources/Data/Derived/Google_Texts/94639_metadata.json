But in its quest to solve the problem, here's a hint for the New York Police Department: Police officers' lack of humor is not the issue here.\n\nThe New York Post recently reported the NYPD is being trained in public-friendly social media use. Not only is there a Twitter handbook that instructs officers on how to use \"tasteful humor\" and gain followers, but the top brass were forced to take a class on Twitter rules and etiquette, too.\n\n\"It's a lot more work ... Now I have to worry about social media on top of everything else I have to do,\" a police source told the Post.\n\nThe NYPD certainly has an image problem. Officers have been taking Twitter classes for a while at John Jay College, being instructed to \"use common sense\" when interacting with the public via social media. But while this seems like a good idea in theory, it's sad that things had to come to this point.\n\nIn recent months, the NYPD has had several Twitter controversies. In July, a precinct captain got into trouble for making a joke about a woman's subway death with this tweet: \"Let me guess, driver's fault right?\"\n\nNaturally, he had to apologize:\n\nSincere apologies 4 insensitive & unprofessional tweets. Not how I was raised, trained, have served. Will work 2 restore trust/confidence.\n\nAnd let's not forget the #myNYPD debacle, when the department tried to promote itself with a hashtag \u2014 and quickly saw it hijacked into a conversation about police brutality:\n\nNeed a mammogram? #myNYPD has you covered!

While it's easy to blame these Twitter snafus on tone-deaf officers and Twitter novices, the fact remains that there are underlying concerns about police brutality and misbehavior that the NYPD is failing to address. As the #myNYPD fiasco showed, there is still significant distrust from the public concerning New York officers' actions \u2014 and cracking a few PG-13 joke is not going to fix that.\n\nInstead of trying to gain Twitter followers with a few laughs, the NYPD could instead make real attempts to amend its image and regain the public trust, such as stopping discriminatory profiling based on race and religion, not seizing innocent people's money, and not getting drunk and randomly shooting at passers-by \u2014 and at each other.\n\nHonestly, Twitter presence might be the least of the NYPD's issues at this point.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "description": "Is this really the best strategy?", "language": "en", "title": "The NYPD Wants Its Cops to be Funnier on Twitter", "og": {"site_name": "Mic", "description": "Is this really the best strategy?", "title": "The NYPD Wants Its Cops to be Funnier on Twitter", "url": "https://mic.com/articles/98860/the-nypd-wants-its-cops-to-be-funnier-on-twitter", "image": "http://thumbs.mic.com/NGZkOGQ2NTg1OCMvakwzN1Nuc3FiTWxYdGY3NzBPS2tqTGREVlFJPS8xNTd4OToxMDg3eDU5Ny8xMjAweDYzMC9maWx0ZXJzOnF1YWxpdHkoODUpL2h0dHBzOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9wb2xpY3ltaWMtaW1hZ2VzL3ZmNWQ0YXBiamRoaWZnMGJycHEyZWl4NmhzdDZ4NTl4anBpa2ZxNjduaGkwbHhrZzg2dWxkM3Z3cGhtZ2gxYWIuanBn.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"user_id": 139909832, "description": "Is this really the best strategy?", "creator": "Micnews", "url": "https://mic.com/articles/98860/the-nypd-wants-its-cops-to-be-funnier-on-twitter", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/policymic-images/vf5d4apbjdhifg0brpq2eix6hst6x59xjpikfq67nhi0lxkg86uld3vwphmgh1ab.jpg", "title": "The NYPD Wants Its Cops to be Funnier on Twitter", "site": "@MicNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mic", "robots": "index, follow", "bt": {"pubDate": "2014-09-15T08:42:03.000Z", "isBlacklisted": "false", "modDate": "2014-09-15T06:16:01.000Z", "keywords": "NYPD, police brutality, police, twitter, News", "type": "evergreen", "id": 98860}, "fb": {"admins": "23342,215337,1410801,675670245,13000939,616963,1479330109,1267070071", "app_id": 141861192518680}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "original-image": "https://media3.mic.com/M2EyNmNkMDFjZiMvbmlaU1dhRVFqSkZydGhHa25xYnJxcWtPRHVzPS8xNTd4OToxMDg3eDU5Ny8xOTEweDEwMDAvZmlsdGVyczpxdWFsaXR5KDg1KS9odHRwczovL3MzLmFtYXpvbmF3cy5jb20vcG9saWN5bWljLWltYWdlcy92ZjVkNGFwYmpkaGlmZzBicnBxMmVpeDZoc3Q2eDU5eGpwaWtmcTY3bmhpMGx4a2c4NnVsZDN2d3BobWdoMWFiLmpwZw==.jpg", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MicMedia", "published_time": "2014-09-15T08:42:03.000Z", "modified_time": "2014-09-15T06:16:01.000Z"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Mic on LinkedIn;action-uri=http://www.linkedin.com/company/policymic;icon-uri=http://linkedin.com/favicon.ico", "identifier-URL": "http://mic.com/articles/74689/the-8-most-dysfunctional-families-in-tv-history"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf8b4\"", "article_summary": "The New York Post recently reported the NYPD is being trained in public-friendly social media use.\nOfficers have been taking Twitter classes for a while at John Jay College, being instructed to \"use common sense\" when interacting with the public via social media.\nWhile it's easy to blame these Twitter snafus on tone-deaf officers and Twitter novices, the fact remains that there are underlying concerns about police brutality and misbehavior that the NYPD is failing to address.\n\"It's a lot more work ...
