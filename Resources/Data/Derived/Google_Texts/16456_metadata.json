What that means for individual taxpayers won't be known until Monmouth County finalizes its overall assessment and determines how the tax levy will be divvied out among the 53 municipalities.\n\nFreeholder John Curley cast the lone vote against the budget, saying he thought it was a bad year to increase taxes as a large portion of Monmouth County begins to see the impact of the Assessment Demonstration Program, a pilot program that revamped how the county assigns value to property.\n\nThe budget does reflect some savings because of the freeholder's decision to privatize its two nursing homes, a move Curley has been pushing for more than five years.\n\nBut Curley said the timing was \"a bit too late\" and that the county could have saved more money had the nursing homes been privatized earlier. He said the county has been using too much money from its surplus fund over the years.\n\n\"You can't live on a credit card. You can't live on your savings account,\" he said.\n\nRELATED: Monmouth County nursing home sale: 7 things to know\n\nFreeholder Tom Arnone said he agreed with Curley's take on the use of surplus funding, but pinned that fault on earlier freeholder boards. He said the current administration has been incrementally working towards using less from surplus, and helps the county maintain its top-notch fiscal rating.\n\nMonmouth County has a AAA bond rating with all three credit rating agencies, an honor only a handful of counties in the country can claim.\n\n\"We are going in the right direction,\" he said.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1z2rQjY", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Monmouth County, N.J. approved its 2015 budget, which includes $4.5 million in new taxes.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Monmouth County, N.J. approved its 2015 budget, which includes $4.5 million in new taxes.", "title": "Tax increase coming to Monmouth County", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/monmouth-county/government/2015/04/24/monmouth-county-approves-budget/26331397/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Monmouth County, N.J. approved its 2015 budget, which includes $4.5 million in new taxes.", "title": "Monmouth County approves budget", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3568e5185c5347646097c7e37bcc9bd4cd90c491/c=819-0-4155-3336&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2015/04/24/B9317106218Z.1_20150424191501_000_GD8AJPKFJ.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Monmouth County NJ, property taxes, budget, tax increase"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c19\"", "article_summary": "Monmouth County approved a 2015 budget that includes $4.5 million in new tax dollars, the first such increase the county has had in five years.\nEARLIER STORY: How much will Monmouth County taxes increase?\nMonmouth County has a AAA bond rating with all three credit rating agencies, an honor only a handful of counties in the country can claim.\n(Photo: Getty Images/Ingram Publishing)Monmouth County approved a 2015 budget that includes $4.5 million in new tax dollars, the first such increase the county has had in five years.\nRELATED: Monmouth County nursing home sale: 7 things to knowFreeholder Tom Arnone said he agreed with Curley's take on the use of surplus funding, but pinned that fault on earlier freeholder boards."}
