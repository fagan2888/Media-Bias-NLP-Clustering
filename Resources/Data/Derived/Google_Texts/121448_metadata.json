They have forced health care providers out of their health plans by offering reimbursement that barely covers the cost of care and constructed narrow networks that offer little coverage for emergency care in many parts of the country.\n\n\u201cPatients can\u2019t choose where and when they will need emergency care and should not be punished financially for having emergencies,\u201d said Dr. Jay Kaplan, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP). \u201cHealth insurance companies need to be transparent about the data they are using to pay for services provided by out-of-network providers. They have a history of data manipulation and not paying for emergency care. They are shifting their responsibility to our patients, and that is just wrong. The federal government has done an injustice to emergency patients and emergency physicians by giving carte blanche to insurance companies to pay whatever they want. Historically we know that amounts to as little as possible.\u201d\n\nHHS has acknowledged that the Affordable Care Act requires that a reasonable amount be paid based on an objective standard when patients receive emergency care from providers who are not in the plan\u2019s network. But the regulation adopted does not hold insurance companies accountable to do what the ACA requires.\n\nDr. Kaplan said ACEP worked with CMS for 4 years to address the out-of-network issue, which is why physicians were shocked by the final rule that allows insurance companies to arbitrarily set their own rates and shift costs they should be paying to patients. The new rule further states that even \u2018minimum standards of payment are not necessary\u2019 in states that have banned balance billing. This decision essentially allows insurance companies to set whatever prices they want without regard to the consequences to patients, health care providers, and our nation\u2019s safety net of emergency care.\n\n\u201cHealth insurance companies have taken gross advantage of patients and emergency medical providers since the ACA, arbitrarily slashing payments by as much as 70 percent,\u201d said Dr. Kaplan. \u201cThey are forcing many providers out of their networks by imposing ridiculously low rates of reimbursement. In addition, health insurance companies are misleading patients by offering so-called \u2018affordable\u2019 premiums for these policies that cover very little because of the narrow networks, high co-pays and astronomical deductibles. It is insurance in name only because there is hardly any real coverage for the patient.\u201d\n\nACEP is asking the federal court to clarify the usual and customary standard, and ultimately to overturn this rule because it was adopted in violation of the government\u2019s rulemaking procedures and does not meet the standards required by the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe are fighting for our patients to get the coverage they deserve and for the thousands of dedicated men and women who staff our nation\u2019s emergency care safety net at all hours every day,\u201d said Dr. Kaplan.\n\nAbout ACEP: ACEP is the national medical specialty society representing emergency medicine.
