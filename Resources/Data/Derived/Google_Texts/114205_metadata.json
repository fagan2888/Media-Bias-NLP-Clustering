Mr. Scott said this was an effort to \u201cforce our state further into Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThis was a preposterous allegation. The two programs are not linked in any way, and the administration had already made clear that it had problems with the charity care program, which was due to expire soon, and had planned to scale it back.\n\nMr. Scott\u2019s disingenuous argument illustrates the lengths that some Republican leaders will go to avoid being blamed for not protecting their poor and uninsured citizens by expanding Medicaid, the federal-state program. The Republican governors of Texas and Kansas, also apparently needing protective cover, have filed amicus briefs supporting the lawsuit.\n\nOn May 21, the Obama administration told Florida in a letter that it would receive less than half of what it wanted for the charity pool for the 2015 fiscal year and even less the following year. At the same time, it suggested that Florida could do itself and its poor residents a favor by expanding Medicaid. It pointed out that by voluntarily expanding its Medicaid program, Florida would increase hospital revenues beyond the payments the hospitals would be getting from the charity pool.\n\nMedicaid expansion would cover an estimated 800,000 uninsured Florida residents, and this is by far the best way for any state to go. The federal government pays 100 percent of the costs of covering newly eligible people through 2016, dropping down to 90 percent in 2020 and future years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCharity pools simply reimburse hospitals and other providers after the fact for financial losses they have suffered for treating underinsured people. Medicaid enables patients to get care at little cost to themselves, reduces the number of uninsured people and strengthens the finances of hospitals with big charity loads. The 21 states that have not yet expanded Medicaid ought to rethink their positions.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150608032123, "twitter": {"description": "Some Republican leaders are ready to go to great lengths to avoid being blamed for failing to protect poor and uninsured citizens.", "title": "Florida\u2019s Foolish Medicaid Lawsuit", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/08/opinion/floridas-foolish-medicaid-lawsuit.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003703621"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/06/opinion/08mon3web/08mon3web-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/08/opinion/floridas-foolish-medicaid-lawsuit.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003703621", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/08/opinion/floridas-foolish-medicaid-lawsuit.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion", "hdl_p": "Florida\u2019s Foolish Medicaid Lawsuit", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "June 8, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Editorials,Scott  Richard L,Medicaid,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Suits and Litigation (Civil),Florida", "news_keywords": "Editorial,Medicaid,Florida", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "The Editorial Board", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/06/opinion/08mon3web/08mon3web-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Scott, Richard L", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By THE EDITORIAL BOARD", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Some Republican leaders are ready to go to great lengths to avoid being blamed for failing to protect poor and uninsured citizens.", "tom": "Editorial", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/06/opinion/08mon3web/08mon3web-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "Some Republican leaders are ready to go to great lengths to avoid being blamed for failing to protect poor and uninsured citizens.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "June 8, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Editorial", "article": {"author": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/opinion/editorialboard.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-05-20", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Florida", "published": "2015-06-08", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "Florida", "slug": "08mon3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160520100006, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/08/opinion/floridas-foolish-medicaid-lawsuit.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/06/opinion/08mon3web/08mon3web-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Some Republican leaders are ready to go to great lengths to avoid being blamed for failing to protect poor and uninsured citizens.", "title": "Florida\u2019s Foolish Medicaid Lawsuit"}, "pdate": 20150608, "des": "Suits and Litigation (Civil)", "articleid": 100000003703621, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Florida\u2019s Foolish Medicaid Lawsuit", "col": "Editorial", "PST": "Editorial"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f96\"", "article_summary": "At the same time, it suggested that Florida could do itself and its poor residents a favor by expanding Medicaid.\nMedicaid expansion would cover an estimated 800,000 uninsured Florida residents, and this is by far the best way for any state to go.\nIt pointed out that by voluntarily expanding its Medicaid program, Florida would increase hospital revenues beyond the payments the hospitals would be getting from the charity pool.\nMr. Scott\u2019s disingenuous argument illustrates the lengths that some Republican leaders will go to avoid being blamed for not protecting their poor and uninsured citizens by expanding Medicaid, the federal-state program.\nMedicaid enables patients to get care at little cost to themselves, reduces the number of uninsured people and strengthens the finances of hospitals with big charity loads."}
