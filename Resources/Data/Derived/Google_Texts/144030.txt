Stafford police have released the names of both the victim and the shooter in a domestic murder March 10. It was the town's first homicide in more than 20 years.

Police released a statement Saturday naming the victim as 41-year-old Samuel B. Salem. Police naming Salem's wife, 35-year-old Misty R. Salem as the shooter.

At just after 11 p.m. police were called to the couple's residence in the 300 block of N Keystone to attend to a male gunshot victim.

Police say the first officer on scene made contact with a hysteric Misty Salem in the front yard. She told him where the weapon was. Another officer recovered the gun a short time later.

First responders found Samuel Salem inside the home on the living room floor with a gunshot wound. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Misty Salem was taken to Barton Co. Jail, and was later booked for second-degree murder charges. She is being held on $1,000,000 bond.

There were two children of the home, one of which had left with a grandparent just prior to the incident. Both children have now been placed with family.

The Kansas Bureau of Investigation was called into investigate the scene while local officers patrolled the perimeter. The incident is still under investigation.
