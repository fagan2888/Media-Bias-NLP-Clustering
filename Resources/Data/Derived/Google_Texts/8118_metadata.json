Racks of Chinese newspapers line the walls.\n\nIn a neighboring room, a man browses a library of about 20,000 traditional Chinese books \u2014 some imported from Taiwan.\n\nDown the hall, nine immigrants practice English grammar and pronunciation during an intermediate ESL class.\n\n\u201cWe all came in as immigrants,\u201d said Grace Tang, director of the center\u2019s board of directors. \u201cWe understand the problems for the new immigrant to adapt and adjust to this new country. We can help them, and this is one way to do it.\u201d\n\nWhen the center first opened in Richardson, it was home to a thriving Asian community, which flocked to the northern suburb for its new housing and school district. Among the arrivals was Tang, who bought her first house in Richardson.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, Asians comprised more than 15 percent of the suburb\u2019s population in 2010.\n\nThe Asian community has continued to move north to communities such as Plano.\n\n\u201cRichardson is where we [Asians] started, as the excellent schools attracted Asians to live here. At that time, it was natural to have a center in Richardson,\u201d Tang said. \u201cNot many Chinese live in Dallas. It didn\u2019t make sense to have a center there.\u201d\n\nSince the center\u2019s opening, finances have been a struggle for the nonprofit, which offers most of its services for free. Fees for the ESL classes include the cost of the book, and the library requires a $20 annual membership, plus $20 deposit.\n\nTang said the library \u2014 which has about 200 memberships \u2014 is the primary public library devoted to providing extensive Chinese reading material. Richardson and Plano public libraries also include Chinese sections, but she said they\u2019re not as large.\n\nIn 2006, the center received a $150,000 grant from the Meadows Foundation. In previous years, the center received funding from the Taiwanese government for outreach and to care for expatriates.\n\nTang said the grant money from the Meadows Foundation was earmarked for expanding services and hiring a bilingual executive director, which was never filled after a year\u2019s search.\n\nInstead the center used the money to expand its hours, open now all week from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. It\u2019s also hired an ESL teacher.\n\nMoney is still one of the nonprofit\u2019s largest struggles, said Johnny Lee, the center\u2019s strategic adviser. He said it costs about $150,000 annually to keep the lights on and run the programs. More than half of the center\u2019s revenue is raised each year at its fundraising gala, which nets about $60,000, he said.\n\nThis year, Tang said the center received a $3,000 grant from Texas Instruments to support the ESL program and its art and cultural programs. The center also plans to apply for grants from the Communities Foundation of Texas.\n\nLee said the funds are essential as the center works to expand its programs to include job training, personal finance instruction and driving classes.\n\nMost recently, the center initiated Saturday seminars on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act with plans to have two more on March 1 and March 8, he said.\n\n\u201cWe try to take the most important news from the Dallas area and spread it to the whole Chinese community. Things like Obamacare, they need to know,\u201d said Anna Chu, the center\u2019s board chairwoman.\n\nWhile the center is fundraising to support its internal programs, revitalization to the shopping center\u2019s exterior is already under way.\n\nYellow caution tape marks off sections of the parking lot as construction workers install statues imported overseas of past Chinese emperors. The Chinese cloud gate marking the entrance are another recent addition from the year-long plan to remodel the center.\n\n\u201cIt used to be a plain shopping strip. We\u2019re working to bring more Chinese flavor. It will be a great tourist spot,\u201d Tang said.\n\nThe center\u2019s renovation efforts align with a mission by the city of Richardson to develop Main Street and its Central Expressway corridor. The plan includes the Chinatown area and 10 other neighborhoods.\n\nA study and market analysis was completed last January. Currently, the city is implementing new zoning regulations to further its vision. Opportunities for public input will follow in the coming months.\n\nTina Firgens, planning project manager for the city, said the development project doesn\u2019t include plans for construction by the city. Rather, the plan will set standards as property owners make modifications, such as the center\u2019s current efforts.\n\nAccording to the study, businesses within the shopping center would be leveraged to form a larger mixed-use district with Asian-inspired structures and artwork. It\u2019s a long-term plan, and it would be decades before the city reaped rewards.\n\nBy that time, the center\u2019s leaders aim to construct a standalone building with a gym and additional classroom space. Lee is eying a neighboring vacant lot at Greenville Avenue and Apollo Road.\n\nBut he estimates that wouldn\u2019t come to fruition for another two to three decades.\n\n\u201cAs long as we continue to have excellent programs, we will grow,\u201d Tang said.\n\nNeighborsgo reporter Nanette Light can be reached at 214-977-8039.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tucked along a strip center marked at the entrance by a Chinese cloud gate and a Confucius statue within, the Dallas Chinese Community Center has been a refuge for Asian immigrants in the Dallas area for almost three decades.", "og": {"description": "Tucked along a strip center marked at the entrance by a Chinese cloud gate and a Confucius statue within, the Dallas Chinese Community Center has been a refuge for Asian immigrants in the Dallas area for almost three decades.", "title": "Three decades later, Dallas Chinese Community Center still heart of Asian culture", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/richardson-lake-highlands/headlines/20140221-three-decades-later-dallas-chinese-community-center-still-heart-of-asian-culture.ece", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/richardson-lake-highlands/headlines/20140220-chinesecenter_0221rc_ednote.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/ChineseCenter_0221RC_EdNote.jpg", "height": 400}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2014-02-21T20:25:29Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2014-02-21T13:37:17Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Three decades later, Dallas Chinese Community Center still heart of Asian culture\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/richardson-lake-highlands/headlines/20140221-three-decades-later-dallas-chinese-community-center-still-heart-of-asian-culture.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/richardson-lake-highlands/headlines/20140220-chinesecenter_0221rc_6.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/ChineseCenter_0221RC_6.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"1451926\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-21T13:37:17Z\", \"section\": \"Richardson Lake Highlands Headlines\", \"author\": \"NANETTE LIGHT\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/news/community-news/richardson-lake-highlands/headlines/20140220-chinesecenter_0221rc_6.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/ChineseCenter_0221RC_6.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-02-21T13:37:17Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8298\"", "article_summary": "Located off Greenville Avenue in Richardson within D-FW China Town, the shopping center is a stronghold for all things Asian.\nTucked along a strip center marked at the entrance by a Chinese cloud gate and a Confucius statue within, the Dallas Chinese Community Center has been a refuge for Asian immigrants in the Dallas area for almost three decades.\nAccording to the study, businesses within the shopping center would be leveraged to form a larger mixed-use district with Asian-inspired structures and artwork.\nAt that time, it was natural to have a center in Richardson,\u201d Tang said.\nWhile the center is fundraising to support its internal programs, revitalization to the shopping center\u2019s exterior is already under way."}
