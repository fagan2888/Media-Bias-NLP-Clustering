The plan, called the \u201cEconomic Growth and Family Fairness Tax Reform Plan,\u201d would dramatically reduce the punitive double taxation of saving and investment that characterizes the Internal Revenue Code and significantly improves the way business income is taxed. You can read their summary of the bill in the Wall Street Journal here, and the details of the bill are here.\n\nFor those of us who care about fundamental tax reform, it\u2019s just about impossible not to be happy with the plan, since many of the provisions address problems that the free-market movement has highlighted for years. But happy isn\u2019t the same as overjoyed. Some aspects of the bill are problematic.\n\nDan Mitchell of the Cato Institute has a good summary of the most pro-growth elements of the plan:\n\nA 25 percent tax rate on all business income \u2013 This means that the corporate tax rate is being reduced from 35 percent (the highest in the world), but also that there will be a 25 percent maximum rate on all small businesses that file using Schedule C as part of a 1040 tax return. Sweeping reductions in double taxation \u2013 The Rubio-Lee eliminates the capital gains tax, the double tax on dividends, and the second layer of tax on interest. Full expensing of business investment \u2013 The proposal gets rid of punitive \u201cdepreciation\u201d rules that force businesses to overstate their income in ways that discourage new business investment. Territorial taxation \u2013 Businesses no longer will have to pay a second layer of tax on income that is earned \u2013 and already subject to tax \u2013 in other nations. No death tax \u2013 Income should not be subject to yet another layer of tax simply because someone dies. The Rubio-Lee plan eliminates this morally offensive form of double taxation. In addition, it\u2019s worth noting that the Rubio-Lee plan eliminates the state and local tax deduction, which is a perverse part of the tax code that enables higher taxes in states like New York and California.\n\nHis whole post is worth reading, here.\n\nMy colleague Jason Fichtner and others have written extensively on the need to implement many of these reforms, so this is good news.\n\nThat being said, there are two nagging issues that have to be addressed if any of us hope to turn good ideas into law.\n\nFirst and foremost, we have to deal with the challenge of enacting a very large tax cut in a fiscal environment of large deficits, particularly since the red ink in the budget is expected to grow as a result of retiring baby boomers. I\u2019m much more worried about the rising burden of government spending than about red ink, but the reality is that both congressional rules and political optics will make it very difficult to enact large tax cuts. What\u2019s more, while I don\u2019t really care about the lack of revenue neutrality in a tax-cutting plan, I believe that to be fiscally responsible, you need a plan that both calls for large tax cuts alongside serious spending cuts. The era of \u201clet\u2019s cut taxes and all our fiscal problems will be resolved\u201d is over.\n\nTo be sure, both senators are very supportive of spending cuts and genuine entitlement reform, and we also should keep in mind that their tax bill will boost growth and produce revenue feedback (at least in the future). However, if history is our guide, they are not representative of the Republican party as a whole. Cutting taxes is great, but it now needs to be done alongside meaningful spending restraint \u2013 meaning serious changes to Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and Obamacare subsidies (see the new CBO report, which outlines how entitlement programs are consuming an ever-growing share of the budget). Doing one without the other would just kick the can farther down the road, an exercise that Republicans are very good at.\n\nThe second problem with the bill is that many free-market types are underwhelmed (for lack of a better word) by the huge child tax credits in the bill, in particular since the inclusion of those credits is \u201cexpensive\u201d in more than one way. For instance, the projected revenue loss is $1.7 trillion over ten years according to the Tax Foundation. I assume this is the reason Rubio and Lee not only aren\u2019t proposing a bigger reduction in the top income tax rate, but are even raising marginal tax rates on a significant number of middle-class and upper-middle class households. (The 35 percent top tax rate in the plan takes effect at just $75,000 of income for single households and $150,000 for married households!)\n\nIt has been noted before, but it is worth repeating: The opportunity cost of expanding the child tax credit in this way is huge, in terms of the possible tax reforms it crowds out. If their proposed child-tax credit were smaller, Rubio and Lee could have also included a low-rate flat tax, for instance. No matter what we hear about top-marginal-tax-rate reductions not yielding as much return at the current levels as they would if the rates were higher, lowering them would still yield more growth than the child tax credit, which does nothing for growth. If bolstering the economic status of families is the point of all this, the way to go is lower tax rates, not a tax credit. So why not solve 100 percent of the problem rather than 50 percent?\n\nTo make matters worse, I don\u2019t buy the justification for the size of the tax credit they\u2019re proposing. It is one thing to support some sort of child tax credit in the name of the idea that every flat-tax proposal has some zero-bracket amount based on family size, generally based on the principle that households shouldn\u2019t be taxed on \u201cnecessity\u201d or \u201cpoverty level\u201d income. But providing giant credits, based on the premise that children are investments in maintaining entitlement programs and that parents should be compensated for the cost of raising their kids goes way overboard.\n\nAccording to the senators, the tax credit would compensate for \u201da parent tax penalty.\u201d They compare it to \u201cthe marriage tax penalty.\u201d But while I think that characterization is a brilliant marketing move on the part of those who think that parents should be rewarded/subsidized, it is also misleading. The marriage tax penalty is real and manifests itself in the form of higher taxes for certain people who get married and file jointly. That\u2019s because government taxes the first dollar a married-couple secondary earner earns, often the wife, at her husband\u2019s highest marginal rate rather than at the rate the wife\u2019s salary warrants. The higher the marginal tax rate, the bigger the penalty.\n\nHowever, people aren\u2019t taxed at a higher rate nor do they pay more taxes the moment they have children. In fact, it is the reverse because of personal allowances. So there is no \u201cparent tax penalty.\u201d\n\nAnd indeed, the senators justify the credit on the grounds that non-parents do not produce future taxpayers to pay for their benefits, even though, like parents, they do pay for current retirees through the payroll tax. I am sorry, but that\u2019s messed up. The current system is unsustainable because, among other reasons, the burden is resting on the shoulders of a diminishing number of future taxpayers. But the current entitlement system is also incredibly unfair, yields terrible returns for many current beneficiaries, and even worse returns for future beneficiaries. Subsidizing/rewarding current parents because they have produced the next generation of taxpayers to pay for old-age entitlement programs doesn\u2019t make the programs more solvent, nor does it make them fair for future generations. What\u2019s more, the evidence that these types of credits will encourage more people to have kids is sketchy at best. The solution to the unfairness and insolvency of these programs is fundamental reform, not a large tax credit.\n\nNow, even if we assume that parents should be rewarded for having produced future taxpayers, there is a much better way to do it than this meddling with the tax code through politically and arbitrarily negotiated subsidies. My colleagues Chuck Blahous and Jason Fichtner, for instance, are critical of the child tax-credit approach and instead suggest adjusting the payroll-tax burden based on the actuarial value-added by children:\n\nWhenever such policies are enacted, government officials are effectively choosing to redistribute income from the childless toward those who are assuming the burden of raising children, based in part on the rationale of recognizing a burden that child-raisers have assumed to the gain of society at large. Many Americans would take offense at the suggestion that the government is, in effect, assigning a dollar value to the raising of children with each such policy adopted. The notion has increased resistance to proposals such as KidSave, which strike many observers as \u201cpaying people to have kids.\u201d But that is already what is implicitly happening through the income tax code and elsewhere (for example, via the child tax credit). . . . We take as a fundamental philosophical starting point for this inquiry that the objective is not to replicate the vagaries of other federal economic policies in compensating for child bearing via arbitrarily negotiated subsidies. The purpose is instead to determine whether a simple policy adjustment could recognize the quantifiable financing responsibilities that families with children assume on behalf of Social Security. . . . There are reasons, however, why such a policy may make greater sense than current law. It would somewhat broaden the base of federal income taxpayers while at the same time helping the poorest working parents through payroll tax relief. Also, it would more directly tie the benefits of (and incentives for) parenting to what such parenting explicitly does for Social Security finances, in contrast with the more nebulous justifications for various \u201cpro-family\u201d exemptions and deductions in current federal income tax law.\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t see why we should reward the people who have already produced children, and I find it a little disturbing to try to make a program that is such a bad deal for future generations solvent rather than reforming it entirely. However, their proposal has the merit of being honest about what they are trying to do, and the cost of doing it, and it is more straightforward about trying to achieve the stated goal for parents of all income levels.\n\nAlso, if old-age entitlement programs discourage people from having children, as some arguments in favor of child tax credits maintain (not those made by Rubio and Lee, as far as I know), then the solution, once again, is to reform the programs that cause the disincentives in the first place rather than try to vaguely offset them.\n\nFinally, there are tons of reasons to have kids and benefits to doing so. That\u2019s why people are still having them even in the face of high costs of child rearing. And while a society with more kids is better than one with fewer kids (bring in immigrants!), the government shouldn\u2019t be in the business of subsidizing the production of children any more than it should favor one type of family arrangement over another. That is even truer if the giant credits are based on the premise that children are investments in maintaining entitlement programs.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "Some Thoughts about the Rubio-Lee Tax Plan", "sailthru.author": "Veronique de Rugy", "description": "Senators Marco Rubio\u00a0and Mike Lee have proposed a major tax-reform plan that would eliminate some of the most punitive features of the tax code.

If bolstering the economic status of families is the point of all this, the way to go is lower tax rates, not a tax credit.\u00a0So why not solve 100 percent of the problem rather than 50 percent?\n\nTo make matters worse, I don\u2019t buy the justification for the\u00a0size of the tax credit\u00a0they\u2019re proposing.\u00a0It is one thing to support\u00a0some sort of child tax credit in the name of the idea that every flat-tax proposal has some zero-bracket amount based\u00a0on family size, generally based on the principle that households shouldn\u2019t be taxed on \u201cnecessity\u201d or \u201cpoverty level\u201d income. But providing giant credits,\u00a0based on the premise that children are investments in maintaining entitlement programs and that parents should be compensated for the cost of\u00a0raising their kids\u00a0goes way overboard.\n\nAccording to the senators, the tax credit would compensate\u00a0for\u00a0\u201da parent tax penalty.\u201d They compare it to \u201cthe marriage tax penalty.\u201d But while I think that characterization\u00a0is a brilliant marketing move on the part of those who think that parents should be rewarded/subsidized, it is also misleading. The marriage tax penalty\u00a0is real and manifests itself in the form of higher taxes for\u00a0certain\u00a0people who get married and file jointly.\u00a0That\u2019s because\u00a0government taxes the first dollar a married-couple secondary earner earns, often the\u00a0wife, at her husband\u2019s highest marginal rate rather than at the rate the wife\u2019s salary warrants. The higher the marginal tax rate, the bigger the penalty.\u00a0\n\nHowever, people aren\u2019t taxed at a higher rate nor do they pay more taxes the moment they have children. In fact, it is the reverse because of personal allowances. So there is no \u201cparent tax penalty.\u201d\u00a0\n\nAnd indeed, the senators justify the credit on the grounds that\u00a0non-parents do not\u00a0produce\u00a0future taxpayers to pay for their\u00a0benefits, even though, like parents, they do pay\u00a0for current retirees through the payroll tax. I am sorry, but that\u2019s messed up. The current system is unsustainable because, among other reasons,\u00a0the\u00a0burden is resting on the shoulders of a diminishing number of future taxpayers. But the current entitlement system is also incredibly unfair, yields terrible returns for many current beneficiaries, and even worse\u00a0returns for future beneficiaries. Subsidizing/rewarding current parents because they have produced the next generation of taxpayers to pay for\u00a0old-age entitlement\u00a0programs doesn\u2019t make the programs more solvent, nor does it make them fair for future generations. What\u2019s more, the evidence that these types of credits will encourage more people to have kids\u00a0is sketchy at best. The solution to the\u00a0unfairness and insolvency of these programs is fundamental reform, not a large tax credit.\u00a0\n\nNow, even if we assume that parents should be rewarded for having produced future taxpayers, there is a much better way to do it than this meddling with the tax code through\u00a0politically and\u00a0arbitrarily negotiated subsidies. My colleagues Chuck\u00a0Blahous\u00a0and Jason\u00a0Fichtner, for instance, are critical of the child tax-credit approach and instead\u00a0suggest\u00a0adjusting the payroll-tax burden based on the actuarial value-added by\u00a0children:\n\n\n\n\nWhenever such policies are enacted, government officials are effectively choosing to redistribute income from the childless toward those who are assuming the burden of raising children, based in part on the rationale of recognizing a burden that child-raisers have assumed to the gain of society at large. Many Americans would take offense at the suggestion that the government is, in effect, assigning a dollar value to the raising of children with each such policy adopted. The notion has increased resistance to proposals such as KidSave, which strike many observers as \u201cpaying people to have kids.\u201d But that is already what is implicitly happening through the income tax code and elsewhere (for example, via the child tax credit). . . .\n\nWe take as a fundamental philosophical starting point for this inquiry that the objective is not to replicate the vagaries of other federal economic policies in compensating for child bearing via arbitrarily negotiated subsidies. The purpose is instead to determine whether a simple policy adjustment could recognize the quantifiable financing responsibilities that families with children assume on behalf of Social Security. . . .\n\nThere are reasons, however, why such a policy may make greater sense than current law. It would somewhat broaden the base of federal income taxpayers while at the same time helping the poorest working parents through payroll tax relief. Also, it would more directly tie the benefits of (and incentives for) parenting to what such parenting explicitly does for Social Security finances, in contrast with the more nebulous justifications for various \u201cpro-family\u201d exemptions and deductions in current federal income tax law.\n\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t see why we should reward the people who have already produced\u00a0children, and I find it a little disturbing to try to make\u00a0a program that is such a bad deal for future generations solvent rather than reforming it entirely. However,\u00a0their proposal has the merit of being honest about what they are trying to do, and the cost of doing it, and it\u00a0is\u00a0more straightforward about trying to achieve the stated\u00a0goal for parents of all income levels.\n\nAlso, if old-age entitlement programs discourage people from having children, as some arguments in favor of child tax credits maintain\u00a0(not those made by Rubio\u00a0and Lee, as far as I know), then the solution, once again, is to reform the programs that cause the disincentives in the first place rather than try to vaguely offset them.\u00a0\n\nFinally, there are tons of reasons to have kids and benefits to doing so. That\u2019s why people\u00a0are still having them\u00a0even in the face of high costs of child rearing. And\u00a0while a society with more kids is\u00a0better than\u00a0one\u00a0with fewer\u00a0kids (bring in immigrants!), the government shouldn\u2019t be in the business of subsidizing the production of\u00a0children any more than it should favor one type of family arrangement over another.

The plan, called the \u201cEconomic Growth and Family Fairness Tax Reform Plan,\u201d would dramatically reduce the punitive double taxation of saving and investment that characterizes the Internal Revenue Code and significantly improves the way business income is taxed. You can read their summary of the bill in the Wall Street Journal\u00a0here,\u00a0and the details of the bill\u00a0are\u00a0here.\u00a0\n\nFor those of us who care about fundamental tax reform, it\u2019s just about impossible not to be happy with\u00a0the plan,\u00a0since many of the\u00a0provisions address problems that the free-market movement has\u00a0highlighted\u00a0for years.\u00a0But happy isn\u2019t the same\u00a0as overjoyed.\u00a0Some\u00a0aspects of the bill are problematic.\u00a0\n\nDan Mitchell of the Cato Institute\u00a0has a good summary\u00a0of the most pro-growth elements of the plan:\n\n\nA 25 percent tax rate on all business income\u00a0\u2013 This means that the corporate tax rate is being reduced from 35 percent (the highest in the world), but also that there will be a 25 percent maximum rate on all small businesses that file using Schedule C as part of a 1040 tax return.\n\nSweeping reductions in double taxation\u00a0\u2013 The Rubio-Lee\u00a0eliminates the\u00a0capital gains tax, the\u00a0double tax on dividends, and the\u00a0second layer of tax on interest.\n\nFull expensing of business investment\u00a0\u2013 The proposal gets rid of\u00a0punitive \u201cdepreciation\u201d rules\u00a0that force businesses to overstate their income in ways that discourage new business investment.\n\nTerritorial taxation\u00a0\u2013 Businesses\u00a0no longer will have to pay a second layer of tax\u00a0on income that is earned \u2013 and already subject to tax \u2013 in other nations.\n\nNo death tax\u00a0\u2013 Income should not be subject to yet another layer of tax simply because someone dies. The Rubio-Lee plan eliminates this\u00a0morally offensive form of double taxation.\n\nIn addition, it\u2019s worth noting that the Rubio-Lee plan eliminates the state and local tax deduction, which is a perverse part of the tax code that enables higher taxes in states like New York and California.\n\n\nHis whole post is worth reading,\u00a0here.\n\nMy colleague\u00a0Jason\u00a0Fichtner\u00a0and\u00a0others\u00a0have written\u00a0extensively\u00a0on the need to implement many of these reforms, so this is good news.\u00a0\n\nThat being said, there are two nagging issues that have to be addressed if any of us hope to turn good ideas into law.\n\nFirst and foremost, we have to deal with the challenge of enacting a very large tax cut in a fiscal environment of large deficits, particularly since the red ink in the budget is expected to grow as a result of retiring baby boomers. I\u2019m much more worried about the rising burden of government spending than about red ink, but the reality is that both congressional rules and political optics will make it very difficult to enact large tax cuts. What\u2019s more, while I don\u2019t really care about the lack of revenue neutrality in a tax-cutting plan, I believe that to be fiscally responsible, you need a plan that both calls for large tax cuts alongside serious spending cuts. The era of \u201clet\u2019s cut taxes\u00a0and all our fiscal problems will be resolved\u201d is over.\n\nTo be sure,\u00a0both senators are very supportive of spending cuts and genuine entitlement reform, and we also should keep in mind that their tax bill will boost growth and produce revenue feedback (at\u00a0least\u00a0in the future). However, if history is our guide, they are not\u00a0representative of the Republican party\u00a0as a whole. Cutting taxes is great, but\u00a0it\u00a0now\u00a0needs to\u00a0be done alongside\u00a0meaningful spending\u00a0restraint\u00a0\u2013 meaning serious changes to Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and\u00a0Obamacare\u00a0subsidies (see the new\u00a0CBO\u00a0report,\u00a0which outlines how entitlement programs are consuming an ever-growing share of the budget). Doing one without the other would just kick the can\u00a0farther down the road, an exercise that Republicans are very good at.\u00a0\n\nThe second problem with the bill is that many free-market types\u00a0are\u00a0underwhelmed\u00a0(for lack of a better word) by the huge child tax credits in the bill, in particular since the inclusion of those credits is \u201cexpensive\u201d in more than one way. For instance, the projected revenue loss is\u00a0$1.7 trillion over ten years\u00a0according to the Tax Foundation.\u00a0I assume this\u00a0is the reason\u00a0Rubio and Lee not only aren\u2019t proposing a bigger reduction in the top income tax rate, but are even raising marginal tax rates on\u00a0a significant number\u00a0of middle-class and upper-middle class households. (The 35 percent top tax rate\u00a0in the plan takes effect\u00a0at just $75,000 of income for single households and $150,000 for married households!)\n\nIt has been noted before, but it is worth repeating: The opportunity cost of expanding the\u00a0child tax credit in this way\u00a0is huge, in terms of the possible tax reforms it crowds out. If their proposed child-tax credit were smaller,\u00a0Rubio and Lee could have also included a low-rate flat tax, for instance. No matter what we hear about top-marginal-tax-rate reductions not yielding as much return at the current levels as they would if the rates were higher, lowering them\u00a0would still yield\u00a0more growth than the child tax credit,\u00a0which does nothing for growth.
