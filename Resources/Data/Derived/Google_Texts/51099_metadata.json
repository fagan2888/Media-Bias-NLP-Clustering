You will hear more about blockchains and distributed-ledger technology applications, disconnected from Bitcoin. This is very complicated stuff, but it\u2019s the future of currency and capital management, so just start learning.\n\nA mere shadow of its former self, Obamacare will continue to collapse under its own structural defects, causing the President\u2019s namesake policy to go from legacy icon to caricature.\n\nAlready referred to by pundits as \u201cthe lawless president,\u201d in his last year Obama will increase his assault on the Constitution with more unprecedented, and now desperate, executive actions.\n\nObama\u2019s newest Constitutional assault will be on the 2 nd Buckle up.\n\nBuckle up. Obama\u2019s Justice Department will not indict Hillary Clinton in 2016, but as evidence of her lying achieves critical mass it will cost HRC Millennial votes, who value honesty over political ideology.\n\nThe GOP primary process will not produce an apparent nominee going into their convention, unless it\u2019s Trump or Cruz.\n\nRepublicans will not win the White House unless the ticket includes a Hispanic and at least one person from Ohio and/or Florida. Look for Trump/Rubio or Cruz/Kasich.\n\nThe social conservatism of Republicans and the socialistic economics of Democrats will create electoral challenges for both parties in 2016.\n\nIf Trump wins the election, it will be because he\u2019s the only candidate most likely to avoid defending the bankrupt elements of either party.\n\nA liberal member of the Supreme Court will exit in 2016, probably in the first half.\n\nWith every member of Generation Y, aka Millennials (80+ million born 1978-1998), old enough to vote in 2016, the electoral influence by this generation is now at critical mass.\n\nMore than just a president, the 2016 election results will reveal the future trajectory of liberty and opportunity in America.\n\nAlabama will become the NCAA Football Division I Champion.\n\nWrite this on a rock \u2026\n\nMy 15-year record is almost 73% accuracy.
