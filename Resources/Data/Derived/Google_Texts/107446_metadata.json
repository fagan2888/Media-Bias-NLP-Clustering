Now new video out shows this issue is not going away anytime soon.\n\nRobert \u201cLaVoy\u201d Finicum did get shot after FBI agents ambushed the occupiers flagrantly left the protection of the wildlife refuge to drive over an hour away to a community meeting. He is a piss-poor martyr \u2014 a taxpayer leech whose supposed hatred of government didn\u2019t stop him from housing foster kids for money and then making those kids do unpaid labor on his ranch \u2014 but he\u2019s the only one they\u2019ve got, so the fringe right has been riding his death as hard as they can in hopes of establishing themselves as the victims here.\n\nThe hopes for turning Finicum into a martyr rest on the possibility that a couple of bullets that were fired by FBI agents, but did not hit him, before he reached for his waistband in what was a clear \u201creaching for the gun\u201d gesture that led to the police killing him*. Originally, the militia movement pushed the notion that Finicum did not reach for his gun and was shot with his hands up. (No big surprise that an unsubtly racist movement would \u201cborrow\u201d the imagery from the Black Lives Matter movement\u2019s slogan \u201cHands Up, Don\u2019t Shoot\u201d to argue that they\u2019re the \u201creal\u201d victims here.)\n\nThat didn\u2019t pan out, as the FBI immediately released an aerial video showing that Finicum did reach for his waistband, where he apparently had a gun. So the narrative changed to arguing that the FBI shot before Finicum reached for his gun.\n\nUnfortunately for the FBI, there is some evidence for this. There\u2019s a Justice Department investigation into the possibility that not only were shots fired unnecessarily, but that FBI agents conspired to hide the evidence. Earlier this week, video from inside of Finicum\u2019s truck, filmed by militia member Shawna Cox, bolsters the argument that FBI agents took shots before Finicum reached for his gun.\n\n\u201cCox\u2019s video showed that one shot hit the truck\u2019s left rear passenger window as Finicum stepped out,\u201d Les Zaitz of the Oregonian writes. \u201cAt the time, Finicum appeared to have his hands at least at shoulder height.\u201d You can watch the video for yourself:\n\nThat said, this video does as much to damage right-wing militia cries of martyrdom as it does to bolster it. When combined with the aerial footage, it paints a picture of Finicum as someone who is violent and reckless at best, and quite possibly out to get himself (and possibly others) killed. When the video starts, Finicum is taunting law enforcement, daring them repeatedly to kill him. Inside the truck the militia members discuss whether they can get away with just taking off, and it\u2019s clear that they are aware of the FBI\u2019s desire not to create martyrs, and see this as evidence that they can just get away scot-free.\n\n\u201cWe have kids in here,\u201d you can hear a woman, likely Cox, saying as they contemplate whether to take the risk that law enforcement is too afraid of bloodshed to open fire. Finicum then throws caution to the wind and takes off, not getting far before running his car into an embankment and nearly running over an FBI agent in the process.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Video from inside Lavoy Finicum's truck shows he was courting death, but the right will still make him a martyr VIDEO", "title": "Right-wingers still in denial about the Oregon militiamen: New video proves they were villains, not martyrs", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Video from inside Lavoy Finicum's truck shows he was courting death, but the right will still make him a martyr VIDEO", "title": "Right-wingers still in denial about the Oregon militiamen: New video proves they were villains, not martyrs", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/20/right_wingers_still_in_denial_about_the_oregon_militiamen_new_video_proves_they_were_villains_not_martyrs/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/lavoy_finicum_memorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Video from inside Lavoy Finicum's truck shows he was courting death, but the right will still make him a martyr VIDEO", "title": "Right-wingers still in denial about the Oregon militiamen: New video proves they were villains, not martyrs", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/lavoy_finicum_memorial.jpg", "creator": "@AmandaMarcotte", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Amanda Marcotte", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Domestic Terrorism, Editor's Picks, LaVoy Finicum, oregon militia, Oregon standoff, Right-wing terrorism, shawna cox", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "So the narrative changed to arguing that the FBI shot before Finicum reached for his gun.\nThere\u2019s a Justice Department investigation into the possibility that not only were shots fired unnecessarily, but that FBI agents conspired to hide the evidence.\nEarlier this week, video from inside of Finicum\u2019s truck, filmed by militia member Shawna Cox, bolsters the argument that FBI agents took shots before Finicum reached for his gun.\nWhen the video starts, Finicum is taunting law enforcement, daring them repeatedly to kill him.\n\u201cCox\u2019s video showed that one shot hit the truck\u2019s left rear passenger window as Finicum stepped out,\u201d Les Zaitz of the Oregonian writes."}
