The omnibus spending bill will get a vote Friday, before it heads over to the Senate for consideration. So far, it looks like the bills are a lock for passage: even the conservative House Freedom Caucus isn't giving Speaker Paul Ryan too much grief, POLITICO reports: http://politi.co/1IVw9lS\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTHOSE OBAMACARE PROVISIONS ARE DELAYED \u2026 BUT THEN WHAT? \u2014 \"The budget deal negotiated on Capitol Hill would strike a $35 billion hole in Obamacare\u2019s financing, but the real concern that is now scaring economists is that the moratorium on three taxes is just the start of their permanent repeal,\" Pro's Jennifer Haberkorn writes. That's a hefty price tag for delay \u2014 but full repeal would cost the government upwards of $250 billion over 10 years. Jen continues: \"[Peter] Orszag and other economists who support the ACA said in interviews with POLITICO that the budget deal\u2019s one- and two-year cuts to the ACA taxes are not catastrophic on their own. But the long-term risk of repeal or continuous delays \u2014 a pattern that has played out many times before \u2014 is worrisome. \u2026 Many economists warn that undermining the long-term cost containment in Obamacare \u2014 of which the Cadillac tax was a key component \u2014 can end up hurting the whole law. The ACA was built on three pillars \u2014 an expansion of health insurance coverage, deficit reduction and cost containment. 'You need all three,' Orszag said.\" The full Pro story, here.\n\nCLINTON HINTS AT OPPOSITION TO OBAMACARE'S 30-HOUR RULE \u2014 The Democratic presidential frontrunner made waves earlier this fall when she broke with the White House to oppose the Cadillac tax. And now Hillary Clinton is suggesting she's not in favor the law's 30-hour workweek rule \u2014 long opposed by Republican lawmakers. \"That\u2019s why [companies] are going to part-time. That, and also, the Affordable Care Act,\" she said, referring first to family leave requirements. \"We've got to change that because we have built in some unfortunate incentives that discourage full-time employment. A lot of employers believe if you don\u2019t work 40-hours a week you don\u2019t get benefits. \u2026 There is a disincentive in our system that we need to deal with and I really worry about it because there is trend to try and move more and more people into part-time work.\" The 30-hour rule took effect in January; a House vote that month repealing the mandate was supported by every Republican and 18 Democrats. Sen. Mitch McConnell hasn't yet delivered on a promise to bring the issue up for a vote in his chamber.\n\nSIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE: PRIVACY VIOLATIONS? \u2014 Like convenience stores and tech companies, drug companies are now offering price discounts and subsidies to patients who are willing to hand over their medical data. And as Pro's Darius Tahir reports, \"The details of that exchange can be easy to miss: they're in the fine print.\" He explores copay cards and patient assistance programs that often explicitly ask patients to waive their HIPAA rights. \"There doesn't seem to be much interest in regulating or legislating the requests away; these days on Capitol Hill, listeners hear more complaints about what HIPAA prevents than what it enables,\" he writes. \"Companies use data to understand how a drug is performing across a population, but also to gain insight for marketing to, or communicating with individual patients, says Robert Merold, an industry consultant. The data requests in the subsidy programs, he added, are mostly focused on the latter use \u2014 direct communication.\" Plenty more here, for Pros: http://politico.pro/1k4etbU\n\nGOOD THURSDAY MORNING and welcome to PULSE, where we couldn't help but think of the novel Station Eleven when we read yesterday's GAO report on how well prepared the nation's airports and airlines are for virus. (Hint: not very well prepared \u2014 and neither the Transportation Department nor the CDC think their agencies should lead efforts to develop a preparedness plan.) That's here: http://1.usa.gov/1NTYaug. If you read Station Eleven, you know how paranoid we're getting now \u2014 so help us tamp that down by sending some other book recommendations, tips and comments to emershon@politico.com and @eemershon.\n\n\"I fly like paper, get high like planes. If you catch me at the border I got PULSE in my name.\"\n\nUNINSURED DON'T KNOW ABOUT SIGN-UP DEADLINES \u2014 There may be a whole hullabaloo in Washington when HHS extends an ACA deadline for two days, but most of the uninsured can't even say when open enrollment ends, according to a new Kaiser Family Foundation poll. Just 7 percent of uninsured respondents correctly said January was the deadline to enroll, they found, though another 20 percent guessed it was the end of this year. About 20 percent said they'd been personally contacted about signing up for coverage in the last six months. Once again, affordability is the main reason they're not signing up \u2014 relatively few cited any other reasons. Yet, about 55 percent said they plan to get coverage in the next few months.\n\n\u2014 Kaiser also asked about support for \"Medicare-for-all,\" which Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders favors. Democrats and independents like the idea, but even Democrats say it wouldn't be a driving issue behind their vote.\n\n** A message from PhRMA: For the last 100 years, heart disease has been the leading cause of U.S. deaths. But these numbers are slowly declining, thanks in large part to innovative new treatments. With nearly 200 medicines in development to treat cardiovascular disease, patients have never had more hope to live longer, healthier lives: http://onphr.ma/1mb2Dyv.**\n\nMEANINGFUL USE BILL MIRED IN HOSPITAL POLITICS \u2014 Congress was all set to vote this week on a mostly uncontroversial package of Medicare tweaks, mostly on meaningful use requirements \u2014 but alas, hospital politics may be mucking that up. House Democrats have asked to add a controversial hospital payment provision \u2014 which would exempt some facilities from payment reductions included in a budget package earlier this year \u2014 to the otherwise uncontroversial bill. Republicans, though, don't want to deal with the hospital payment issue until next year. Democrats are now holding up that underlying bill until they get their way, and their opposition got the smaller package pulled from the voting schedule. Last night, Sen. Ron Wyden and Reps. Gene Green and Jim McDermott \u2014 all Dems \u2014 dropped a similar package that adds the hospital payment provision and does not include a provision on MA star ratings, Dem staffers tells PULSE. Lawmakers could still drop the drama and voice-vote the uncontroversial meaningful use bill, but it could also end up all getting put off until next year. We're tracking.\n\nTHE TREASURE HUNT CONTINUES \u2014 Your PULSEr has a feeling we might be unearthing omnibus provisions for the next several years \u2026 but for now, a few more for your radar:\n\n\u2014 POPULAR FDA VOUCHER PROGRAM EXTENDED: The omnibus spending package extends FDA\u2019s rare pediatric disease priority review voucher program until Sept. 30, just as the popular incentive was about to sunset. The program encourages companies to develop drugs for rare diseases in children by rewarding FDA approval of one of these products with a voucher for an expedited review of another drug. The program has been popular, and companies who\u2019ve obtained a voucher have been able to sell them for hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 yes, that\u2019s how valuable companies believe getting their drug on the market just months sooner may be. Martin Shkreli\u2019s plan to take advantage of a similar voucher program for drugs that treat neglected disease in developing countries has drawn attention to loopholes that may allow companies to profit from the program even if they don\u2019t invest in new drugs.\n\n\u2014 AND SUBSTANTIAL MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING: The omnibus also offers full funding for assisted outpatient treatment programs that give courts the ability to mandate treatment for severely and chronically mentally ill people. It's the first time Congress has funded these programs, which were authorized in earlier legislation. Indeed, separate grants for the same kind of AOT programs have been a major sticking point in the debate over Rep. Tim Murphy's mental health legislation in the House.\n\n\u2014 The bill puts $15 million toward Mental Health First Aid, a training program for law enforcement officers, educators and school bus drivers. It also authorized an early intervention program for individuals experiencing schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.\n\n\u2014 EXCHANGES MAKE IT, TOO \u2014 The omnibus includes language requiring CMS to make sure state-based exchanges aren't using federal grants for operational expenses, which is prohibited by the ACA and has been a focus of Republican probes. The ACA required state-based exchanges to be financially self-sustaining at the start of 2015, but CMS has allowed states to keep spending federal grants on developmental expenses under no cost extensions for funding that was already awarded. CMS Acting Administrator Andy Slavitt told a House panel last week that federal officials have denied states grant funding requests more than 60 times this year \u2026 Separately, Rep. Rick Allen introduced legislation on Wednesday requiring failed state exchanges to return money to the federal government.

(A quick preview that won't surprise you: Obamacare wasn't on the list of winners.)\n\nACA SIGNUPS, PRE-SURGE: 1.3M \u2014 That's how many people signed up in the sixth week of enrollment. Through Dec. 12, 4.2 million have signed up for 2016 plans, including 1.5 million new customers, CMS said. Those figures don't account for the \"unprecedented\" spike in interest over the last few days, ahead of the deadline for obtaining coverage beginning Jan. 1.\n\nANOTHER STUDY SHOWS HIGHER PREMIUMS \u2014 The average premiums for Obamacare's silver plans increased by 11.3 percent from 2015 to 2016, and the average individual deductible for silver plans spiked by 17.7 percent, according to data released by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Manatt Health Solutions. (Silver plans, of course, are the most popular exchange product and help set the benchmark for subsidies.) Like others before it, this study found significant variance across the country. RWJF's Kathy Hempstead points out that the gap between the cheapest and most expensive plans widened in 2016, suggesting insurers are still trying to find the right products for the new markets. \"Carriers are still kind of experimenting and trying to figure out a winning model,\" she said.\n\nRE-INTRO'D: NURSE WORKPLACE SAFETY BILL \u2014 Sen. Al Franken is reintroducing the Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act, which would forbid nurses from manually lifting patients and establish other safety standards. Hospitals would have to develop safe patient handling plans, too. The legislation builds on continuing private sector efforts to address widespread injuries among nurses, who currently suffer more workplace problems than construction or mining workers. And it follows an OSHA memo this summer that laid out new ways that the Labor Department inspectors can help ensure hospitals are protecting worker safety.\n\nROSENBAUM TO CHAIR MACPAC \u2014 Sara Rosenbaum, a GWU health policy professor, will chair the Medicaid- and CHIP-focused group. GAO also announced seven new commissioners to fill expiring spots: Brian Burwell, Toby Douglas, Leanna George, Kit Gorton, Stacey Lampkin, Penny Thompson and Alan Weil.\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\nNEJM's editorial board writes that gun violence is an assault on public health: https://t.co/5dAfrLMrjI\n\nThe Daily Caller reports on internal investigations at the Phoenix VA medical center that show officials were never held accountable for retaliating against whistleblowers: http://bit.ly/1P8gFuc\n\nAnother risk corridor casualty \u2014 this one in Sen.

These therapies have the potential to build on the progress made by existing treatments, reducing repeat hospitalizations and death. Learn more at http://onphr.ma/1mb2Dyv.**\n\n** A message from National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA): Many Medicare drug plans effectively require the use of \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies that are inconvenient for patients. That means a long trip or higher copays to stick with the pharmacies that patients like. In urban areas, these plans often fail to meet the government\u2019s standard for pharmacy access. In rural areas, \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacies are often 20+ miles away! Support H.R. 793 / S. 1190. This bipartisan legislation is supported by leading consumer advocates and would let patients use any pharmacy willing to accept the \u201cpreferred\u201d pharmacy terms and conditions.
