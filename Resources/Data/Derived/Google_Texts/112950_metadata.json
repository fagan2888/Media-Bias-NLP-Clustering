Clinton wouldn\u2019t say if she would take executive action to close the prison as president.\n\nShe also tread carefully when asked about a 2016 ballot measure that would create a single-payer healthcare system in Colorado. The measure is being pushed by Democrats in the state.\n\n\u201cStates are the laboratories of democracy and I know there\u2019s a very strong push to put this measure on the ballot. I support the Affordable Care Act and improving it \u2026 I want to get costs down \u2014 the out-of-pocket costs, the premiums, the deductibles. I want to get prescription drug costs down. So, I think it will be up to the people of Colorado to make a judgement on this proposal.\u201d\n\nClinton noted Vermont tried something similar and it failed.\n\nOn women\u2019s health care, Clinton said she supports over-the-counter birth control.\n\n\u201cI think that over-the-counter birth control is a real possibility that will make drugs more available and more cheaply,\u201d she said.\n\nBut, her campaign said she only supports it if insurance pays for it.\n\nIn addition to the Affordable Care Act, Clinton says she wants to improve the Veterans Administration. She has previously said she doesn\u2019t think the scandal, involving veterans dying on waitlists, is as widespread as reported, but she denied downplaying it and she rejected any attempt to privatize the VA.\n\n\u201cIt would be a great loss to our veterans if we were to just end the VA and turn everyone out into the private marketplace. Some of the specialized needs veterans have, like prosthetics for example, there\u2019s nobody better in the world than our VA,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s fix it, let\u2019s hold people accountable that were not doing the job they were sworn to do.\u201d\n\nClinton also addressed the VA Hospital in Aurora, which is millions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule.\n\nShe called it \u201cappalling\u201d that the facility was so long in coming.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what we need to do more of to make sure the VA works, but I\u2019m going to get to the bottom of it when I\u2019m president,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nShe also promised action on gun control.\n\n\u201cI think there may be some areas for executive action particularly with the provisions under federal law now to really focus on certain gun sellers and hold them accountable\u2026 I\u2019m going to wait to see what, if anything, President Obama does. I prefer to handle it legislatively, but lives are at stake. We\u2019re losing 33,000 people a year and frankly there\u2019s a relatively small number of gun sellers who are responsible for most of the guns that end up in the hands of those who kill others.\u201d\n\nColorado Gov. John Hickenlooper has been rumored to be a possible vice presidential candidate.\n\nClinton said \u201cI have the highest regard for your governor. He\u2019s one of the most creative and effective governors in the country.\u201d\n\nBut, she said it\u2019s premature to say who her running mate might be if she wins the nomination.\n\nShaun Boyd is CBS4\u2019s political specialist.
