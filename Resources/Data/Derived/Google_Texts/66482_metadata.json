Only 20 of the 54 Republicans voted not to accept a budget that subsidized Big Abortion. Among those who stood on principle were presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Rand Paul (though he was AWOL the other night when Cruz tried to attach defunding to the bill), a handful of the Senate\u2019s more conservative members, and only one member of Senate majority leadership: Republican Conference Vice Chair Roy Blunt.\n\nAs usual, Cruz did more than just vote; on Monday night he called out his own party\u2019s leaders for their dereliction, right there on the Senate floor:\n\nYou know, one of the dynamics, Mr. President, we\u2019ve seen in fight after fight is Harry Reid and the Democrats sit back and laugh. Why? Because it\u2019s Republican leadership that leads the onslaught, attacking conservatives saying, \u2018No, you can\u2019t and we won\u2019t do anything to stop Obamacare. No, you can\u2019t and we won\u2019t do anything to stop Planned Parenthood [\u2026] And Republicans, in this bizarre process, Republican leadership will blame whatever Obama does on other Republicans. You noticed how much energy Leader McConnell devotes to attacking conservatives? You notice how much energy Speaker Boehner devotes to attacking conservatives?\n\nAll the body\u2019s other GOP leaders\u2014Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Majority Whip John Cornyn, GOP Conference Chair John Thune, and GOP Policy Committee Chair John Barrasso\u2014voted yes. And the other two GOP senators running for president, Lindsey Graham and Marco Rubio, didn\u2019t show up for the vote. Graham is no surprise since he\u2019s always been against using the CR to defund, but it\u2019s especially lamentable that Rubio, who\u2019s been one of the more effective spokesmen for the preborn in the field, has dodged the shutdown debate. Sure, his vote wouldn\u2019t have changed the outcome, but his voice could have drawn more attention to the issue and brought more pressure to the obstructionists.\n\nThe House of Representatives, meanwhile, voted 277-151. Here there\u2019s at least the silver lining that more Republicans voted against funding Planned Parenthood (151) than for (91). And just as the Senate vote provided us the opportunity to compare and contrast the strength of several people who might be the next chief executive, the House vote showed us a sampling of how some of the legislative branch\u2019s next would-be leaders approached the issue.\n\nThe yes voters included majority leader and presumptive Speaker frontrunner Kevin McCarthy, current majority whip and possible candidate for majority leader Steve Scalise, and chief deputy whip and potential majority whip candidate Patrick McHenry.\n\nNo voters included potential Speaker candidate Daniel Webster, possible majority leader candidate Tom Price, potential majority whip candidate Peter Roskam, possible majority whip candidate Pete Sessions, and senior deputy whip and potential majority whip candidate Dennis Ross.\n\nThe good news, then, is that a few people in leadership positions voted not to ask \u201chow high?\u201d when Obama said \u201cjump,\u201d but the bad news is that their odds of winning are remote. Despite some conservative opposition, McCarthy is generally considered a lock for the Speakership if for no other reason than his competitors\u2019 lack of organization (then again, if there really were enough votes to depose John Boehner, presumably there would be enough to deny his hand-picked successor as well).\n\nSo as bad as things look, this at least gives genuinely pro-life activists and lawmakers a direction to work toward. In the battle between Congress\u2019s pro-abortion, pro-life-in-name-only, and pro-results pro-life factions, the next step has to be for the third faction to become better organized and more strategy-minded\u2014using the media more effectively to get their message out and get more of Group 2\u2019s followers to defect, actively groom their members for the duties of leadership, and deciding who is best suited for leadership posts and building support for them further in advance than a week before the elections.\n\nTurning Congress from a body that occasionally tells pro-lifers what we want to hear into one actually committed to pro-life outcomes is doable, but it will require all involved to reevaluate their standard methods of doing business and shape up or ship out.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Turning Congress from telling pro-lifers what we want to hear into committing to pro-life outcomes is doable, but it can't be business as usual.", "og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "Turning Congress from telling pro-lifers what we want to hear into committing to pro-life outcomes is doable, but it can't be business as usual.", "title": "Where do we go after Planned Parenthood funding vote?", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 672, "identifier": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/United-States-Senate.jpg", "height": 372}, "updated_time": "2015-10-02T17:32:41-04:00", "url": "http://liveactionnews.org/go-planned-parenthood-funding-vote/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Turning Congress from telling pro-lifers what we want to hear into committing to pro-life outcomes is doable, but it can't be business as usual.", "creator": "@liveactionnews", "image": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/United-States-Senate.jpg", "title": "Where do we go after Planned Parenthood funding vote?", "site": "@liveactionnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "fb": {"admins": 159900244, "pages": 49651563727}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/liveactionnewsonline", "section": "Politics", "tag": "Tom Price", "published_time": "2015-10-02T16:37:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-02T17:32:41-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "No voters included potential Speaker candidate Daniel Webster, possible majority leader candidate Tom Price, potential majority whip candidate Peter Roskam, possible majority whip candidate Pete Sessions, and senior deputy whip and potential majority whip candidate Dennis Ross.\nHere there\u2019s at least the silver lining that more Republicans voted against funding Planned Parenthood (151) than for (91).\nThe yes voters included majority leader and presumptive Speaker frontrunner Kevin McCarthy, current majority whip and possible candidate for majority leader Steve Scalise, and chief deputy whip and potential majority whip candidate Patrick McHenry.\nOnly 20 of the 54 Republicans voted not to accept a budget that subsidized Big Abortion.\nNo, you can\u2019t and we won\u2019t do anything to stop Planned Parenthood [\u2026] And Republicans, in this bizarre process, Republican leadership will blame whatever Obama does on other Republicans."}
