As it turns, at least one cop is a fan of the superstar. See the full photo below!\n\nBieber was at Kreation Juice in Beverly Hills last weekend when a local police officer walked in and spotted the star and approached him. But the cop wasn\u2019t after the singer for any wrongdoing. The guy was apparently a fan, and asked to take a picture with Bieber. In the snapshot, the star has a slight smile, while the officer is grinning widely, with his arm even around Bieber\u2019s back.\n\nThe pleasant meeting came two months after Bieber had another peaceful run-in with the cops, albeit ones in New York. As Gossip Cop reported, the 21-year-old paid for dinner for a group of police officers at a diner, picking up the $200 tab. He also posed for a group picture.\n\nOf course, not all of Bieber\u2019s past experiences with cops have gone as well, most notably his 2014 arrest in Miami. And, as Gossip Cop recently reported, an Argentine judge issued a warrant for his arrest earlier this month. Shortly after that, Bieber was allegedly kicked out of Coachella and put in a chokehold by security.
