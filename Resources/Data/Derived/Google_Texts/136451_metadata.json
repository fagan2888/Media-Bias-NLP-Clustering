If the Defense Department doesn\u2019t establish a plan in a timely manner, the facilities will be at risk.\n\nRelated: Military Shifting Towards Clean-Energy Fuels\n\nThe report comes just a week after the House passed a Defense Department 2015 budget that includes an amendment barring the department from spending money on climate change initiatives. Of course, that amendment is not expected to survive the Senate. So the two chambers will have to sort this out at conference.\n\nThe auditors examined five climate change effects flagged by the Pentagon as potential threats to military assets around the world, including rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, more storms, higher sea levels and rising ocean temperature.\n\nThey found that climate change is already negatively affecting some military facilities.\n\nIn Alaska, for example, rising sea levels have caused coastal erosion at several Air Force radar installations. Similarly, officials on a Navy installation told the auditors, \u201cThey are concerned about possible storm surge during work on a submarine that will be cut in half while sitting in a dry dock.\u201d They said, \u201cIf salt water floods the submarine's systems, it could result in severe damage.\u201d\n\nRelated: 10 Biggest Risks Threatening Taxpayer Dollars\n\nThe report also found that 9 out of 15 military areas have experienced difficult training conditions due to wildfires and precipitation changes.\n\n\u201cAccording to DOD, its U.S. infrastructure is vulnerable to the potential impacts of climate change. These could affect DOD's readiness and fiscal exposure,\u201d the report said.\n\nThough GAO notes that the Pentagon has at least started identifying facilities that are threatened by climate change, its \u201clack of planning\u201d could hinder its efforts.\n\nThe auditors said officials \u201crarely propose climate change adaptation projects\u201d because planners \u201cmay believe that climate change projects are unlikely to successfully compete with other military construction projects for funding.\u201d\n\n(Congress is much happier to secure funding for things like this.)\n\nStill, the Pentagon concurred with the GAO and said it would develop a focused approach to survey all facilities that may be threatened by climate change.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Thousands of military facilities across the world are threatened by rising sea levels,", "title": "U.S. Military Bases Threatened by Climate Change", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/01/US-Military-Bases-Threatened-Climate-Change", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/10292012_storm_flood.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/01/US-Military-Bases-Threatened-Climate-Change", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/10292012_storm_flood.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Thousands of military facilities across the world are threatened by rising sea levels,", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The auditors said officials \u201crarely propose climate change adaptation projects\u201d because planners \u201cmay believe that climate change projects are unlikely to successfully compete with other military construction projects for funding.\u201d(Congress is much happier to secure funding for things like this.)\nThousands of military facilities across the world are threatened by rising sea levels, ocean temperatures and increasing storm frequency brought on by climate change.\nThey found that climate change is already negatively affecting some military facilities.\n\u201cAccording to DOD, its U.S. infrastructure is vulnerable to the potential impacts of climate change.\nStill, the Pentagon concurred with the GAO and said it would develop a focused approach to survey all facilities that may be threatened by climate change."}
