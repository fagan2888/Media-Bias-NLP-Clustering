Luther College invites faculty, staff, students and the Decorah community to the third annual Faculty Research Symposium, beginning at 9:15 a.m. Saturday, Sept. 19, in Valders Hall of Science Room 206 on the Luther campus.

After a brief welcome session, interdisciplinary panel presentations will commence at 10 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 2 p.m. in Valders Hall of Science Room 206 and in the Franklin W. Olin Building Room 102. The event is open to the public, with no charge for admission. For a complete schedule of the day's events see: http://www.luther.edu/academics/dean/faculty/faculty-research-symposium/.

At each panel, three or four faculty members from a range of disciplines, like biology, English, anthropology and women and gender studies, will present their research under a common topic. Presenters cover a range of hot-button issues like race and the Affordable Care act, media coverage of immigration and trade in China. Professors will also present on authors like Mary Shelley, Henrik Ibsen and David Foster Wallace.

A companion event to the Student Research Symposium held each spring, the Faculty Research Symposium provides a forum for Luther faculty to share and discuss their research, projects and passions with the broader Decorah community as well as with Luther students, faculty and staff.

The event will close with a harpsichord performance by Kathryn Reed, Luther instructor in music, at 4 p.m. in the Noble Recital Hall in Jensen-Noble Hall of Music.
