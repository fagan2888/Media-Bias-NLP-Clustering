Better educated and healthier than earlier generations, boomers not only are living longer, increasing demands on everything from housing to health care, they also are working longer, changing the way people think about career and retirement, he said.\n\nDavid Alley is executive director at Shift, a Twin Cities-based organization that runs programs focused on navigating midlife work-life transitions. Shift\u2019s mission, he says, is helping participants combine \u201cpurpose, passion and a paycheck\u201d in what he describes as \u201cthe perfect trifecta.\u201d And those seekers have a lot of company: Nearly 19 percent of people 65 and older remain in the workforce, a number that has been steadily growing since the mid-1980s and stands at the highest level in half a century, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThree Shift alumni shared with me their very individual stories about writing their own second acts.\n\nCharting a phased retirement\n\nWhile no longer working for pay after a 37-year career spent mostly at Medtronic, Ron Stuedemann, like many retirees, keeps busy in volunteer activities including roles on the boards of both Shift and a Medtronic retiree group. But to get there Stuedemann created his own unique path to retirement.\n\nAs he approached his 61st birthday a decade ago, (\u201cthe same age my dad died,\u201d he recalls) Stuedemann wondered how he would decelerate from the fast pace he was used to as manager of global customer support and hand off his highly technical job at the global medical device maker. He proposed phasing himself out over the following year while helping identify and mentor successors. He also cut back to four days a week while exploring life outside of work, taking a 20 percent pay cut.\n\nAs more boomers retire from specialized jobs with a thin bench of experienced replacements behind them, phased retirement is an obvious solution, Stuedemann believes, because it simultaneously fosters career growth for younger workers. But most companies lack formal policies on phased retirement, and late-career employees may fear that suggesting it will marginalize them, he said.\n\nWhile Medtronic had no precedent for his script, his manager agreed to it \u201cbecause it made business sense. It was right for the functions, right for the people,\u201d Stuedemann noted.\n\nBuilding a portfolio career\n\nAfter his second layoff in 1998 following a 30-year career with city and regional planning agencies in Texas and Minnesota, Vic Ward vowed never to work in a big organization again. He taught himself how to build websites and launched his first of many business start-ups.\n\nToday, the 71-year-old provides research on future careers to the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU) website. After participating in a Shift workshop, he also launched a training program teaching seniors how to use smartphones and tablets. And now he is rewriting that same Shift curriculum to help other boomers find satisfying work or volunteer opportunities.\n\nWard wants to keep working, both for the challenge of tackling new problems and to continue earning money. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I make money but that I have meaningful work as I define it,\u201d he said.\n\nCombining work and mission\n\nLisa Sabourin describes herself as \u201ca typical worker of my generation.\u201d She joined Investors Diversified Services out of college and rose into management roles over two-plus decades within what eventually became Ameriprise before finding herself on the wrong side of a divestiture in 2007. Seeking a change, she earned a mini-MBA in nonprofit management and applied, without success, for several jobs in that sector before heading back into the corporate world. Laid off again in early 2012, she took a different tack, throwing herself into volunteering for several nonprofits.\n\nSabourin figured she would \u201cget to know people and get them to know me\u201d with the goal of combining her business background with her desire to work in a mission-driven organization. That approach led to a temporary paid position at Catholic Charities that gave her the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 she needed to land her current role as a project coordinator at the Emergency Foodshelf Network.\n\nWhile she doesn\u2019t earn the income she did in her corporate roles, Sabourin finds a different measure of success. She gets paid to work at an organization where everyone shares a sense of mission.\n\n\u201cI have no plans to retire if my work is meaningful work,\u201d Sabourin said. \u201cFinally I am where I wanted to be.\u201d\n\nFor more information on Shift programs, go to www.shiftonline.org.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "If America is a land of second acts, then baby boomers are writing the script &mdash; one character, one scene at a time.", "title": "Brad Allen: Retirees are writing their own second acts", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/brad-allen-retirees-are-writing-their-own-second-acts/265743131/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140442018052572.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140442018052572.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "If America is a land of second acts, then baby boomers are writing the script &mdash; one character, one scene at a time.", "title": "Brad Allen: Retirees are writing their own second acts", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/brad-allen-retirees-are-writing-their-own-second-acts/265743131/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140442018052572.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_140442018052572.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "If America is a land of second acts, then baby boomers are writing the script &mdash; one character, one scene at a time."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea25\"", "article_summary": "While she doesn\u2019t earn the income she did in her corporate roles, Sabourin finds a different measure of success.\n\u201cI have no plans to retire if my work is meaningful work,\u201d Sabourin said.\nIf America is a land of second acts, then baby boomers are writing the script \u2014 one character, one scene at a time.\nThree Shift alumni shared with me their very individual stories about writing their own second acts.\nDavid Alley is executive director at Shift, a Twin Cities-based organization that runs programs focused on navigating midlife work-life transitions."}
