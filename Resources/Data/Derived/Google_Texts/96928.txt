Glenn Beck tore into Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain Thursday over new comments he made about repealing Obamacare that were at odds with statements he made in September.

Beck said more than once that he couldn’t decide whether McCain is a “dirtbag weasel” or a “weasel dirtbag.”

Speaking on his radio program, Beck said that when GOP Sens. Ted Cruz and Mike Lee were fighting to repeal the legislation a number of weeks ago, McCain said such a goal was “not rational.” Cruz, Lee, and anyone who supported their efforts were called everything from “anarchists” to “terrorists” (though not necessarily by McCain).

But Beck said now that “the lousy senator from Arizona” has seen how “the political winds have changed,” he wants to jump on the bandwagon.

“I’d like to call him ‘the good senator from Arizona,’ but I don’t think he’s a good senator from Arizona,” Beck said. “I think he’s a lousy senator from Arizona.”

Beck played audio from McCain’s interview with Greta Van Susteren on Fox News Wednesday, where the senator advocated reforms like allowing individuals to purchase insurance across state lines and medical malpractice reform, before launching into another tirade.

“John McCain, you’re such a maverick,” Beck said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. “He’s almost such a maverick he’s old-timey. It’s almost like he’s using someone else’s recycled idea, you know? And it’s almost like he had to destroy someone so he could retain his power! You know what I mean? And then take his idea and then just recycle it, repackage it, and then go on the sources that won’t hold him accountable at all, because they are part of the problem. You know what I mean? It’s almost that much of a maverick.”
