We can\u2019t tax corporations \u2013 they\u2019re job creators. We can\u2019t begrudge all of the money corporations amass \u2013 they need that money to become job creators. It turns out, however, that these excuses are just that: despite the fact that corporate profits are at an all-time high, large companies aren\u2019t actually using this money to create new jobs.\n\nReuters analyzed figures of the 100 largest companies and found a disturbing disparity between the rate at which businesses are profiting and hiring personnel. Between 2001 and 2013, corporations\u2019 profits (adjusted for inflation) have risen an astounding 150%. Simultaneously, hiring has only increased by 31% in that same period.\n\nAlthough optimists like to imagine that as a company grows it takes on more staff to handle its growing needs, that\u2019s clearly not the case. With profits booming five times faster than the corporations are hiring, companies have found a way to rake in more money while having to share it with fewer employees. So much for being \u201cjob creators\u201d after all.\n\nNotably, that modest 31% increase in hiring is on a global scale. Most of the jobs that have been created in the wake of rising corporate profits have been filled overseas. In that respect, at this point, Americans shouldn\u2019t expect that corporate success will have any bearing on jobs in the United States. Those who use corporate profits as the main indicator of a thriving economy are looking at an incomplete picture.\n\nIt\u2019s not all bad for American consumers, though. Inexpensive labor abroad allows for cheaper products sold in American markets. The decrease in American jobs offering middle class wages appears to hit the overall economy even harder, though, meaning the cheaper products are probably not worth the tradeoff (not to mention the ethical questions frequently involved in cheaper labor abroad).\n\nAs for the jobs that have been created in the United States, most of them are low wage positions. Corporations certainly are not reinvesting these profits into expanding the middle class. Matthew Slaughter, a professor at Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business, explained to Reuters that \u201cwhether you like it or not,\u201d the rise in productivity isn\u2019t actually a boon for the economy since only a small amount of people are reaping the financial rewards.\n\nReuters\u2019s examination also found that plenty of companies \u2013 about one in three \u2014 are even going so far as to cut jobs as they see their profits rapidly grow. In a 12 year span, Verizon doubled its profits while simultaneously laying off 30% of its staff.\n\nIt\u2019s time to dispel the myth that corporations that turn huge profits are good for society. Rather than using that wealth to create jobs, they hoard this money to ensure that a small percentage of executives have all of the money. Laborers are working harder than ever for less compensation and we choose to ignore this injustice because it\u2019s just \u201ccapitalism.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, then, it\u2019s time to reconsider how capitalism is working out for us altogether.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Corporate profits are increasing at five times the rate that they're hiring.
