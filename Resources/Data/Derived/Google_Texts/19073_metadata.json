At this pace, the economy is on track to produce the largest number of jobs in 15 years.\n\nOne development that also caught much attention, average hourly wages rose higher than expected, the largest increase since June of last year.\n\nEven so, earnings have grown a sluggish 2 percent in the past year.\n\nHari Sreenivasan has the story from our New York studios.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: I\u2019m joined by Diane Swonk, an economist with Mesirow Financial, a financial services firm.\n\nSo, what\u2019s behind the higher number today?\n\nDIANE SWONK, Mesirow Financial: Well, a lot of good news.\n\nWe had actually some meat-on-the-bone jobs in things like business services. That\u2019s an area that was really hard-hit during the recession. It includes everything from accountants, technical consultants, engineers, architects. That\u2019s the good news.\n\nWe saw those meat-on-the-bone jobs. We also some manufacturing and construction jobs, off a low base, but still some jobs in those sectors. And then there was this huge hiring in retail, also in food, restaurants, all those kind of areas that are more\u2026\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Just from the holiday season?\n\nDIANE SWONK: Holiday hires, but not just holiday hires; 20 percent of the retail hiring was in the auto sector to sell cars. That\u2019s not really what we tend to buy as gifts for the holiday season.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.\n\nDIANE SWONK: So, some of it was holiday.\n\nBut also we saw that instead of \u2014 department stores didn\u2019t hire up. And the big box retailers didn\u2019t hire up. And that\u2019s because they\u2019re showing off their online presence. So, you saw warehousing, people who package things in the back and shippers \u2014 shippers are hiring but, because last year, remember, we had some bad weather and lots of online spending.\n\nAnd I was one of the those people who didn\u2019t get their Christmas present on time.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nDIANE SWONK: The ones you want to give \u2014 you know, it\u2019s just not good when it comes three days later.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Right. Right.\n\nDIANE SWONK: And so they\u2019re trying to get that in order all year.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So, not all jobs are created equal. Some of these jobs pay better than others. What\u2019s the quality of the jobs that we\u2019re seeing?\n\nDIANE SWONK: We had some really good-quality jobs, which in the last six months, we have started to see some good-quality jobs come back. That\u2019s the good news.\n\nSome of these full-time jobs \u2014 business services used to be something \u2014 the temporary hires is what we used to talk about. These are not temporary hires. These are full-time hires and these are full-time jobs. On the other side of it, still a large majority of these jobs are minimum-wage jobs.\n\nAnd also the number of people taking multiple jobs went up this month. And part of that is things like not related to the retail hiring season, but also hedging against the Affordable Care Act. They\u2019re not providing health care, but they have got to get their hours down below 30 hours. And some people who work in a restaurant work 48 hours a week, so, all of a sudden, you\u2019re splitting one job into almost two.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So maybe more part-time work.\n\nDIANE SWONK: Exactly.\n\nAnd we\u2019re seeing more people holding multiple jobs this month than we did last month. And that picked up. And the number people accepting part-time when they\u2019re looking full-time is still high. So, it was a step in the right direction. But we didn\u2019t land on the moon here. This was \u2014 as good as the number was, we have got a long way to go to regain what we have lost.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: OK.\n\nIs there \u2014 we always have all these caveats when we look at these numbers, but at what point \u2014 how many months going back do we need to look and say there is something positive happening here?\n\nDIANE SWONK: I think this year really has been a transitional year, because we get what I call those, like I said, the meat-on-the-bone jobs, the full-time jobs that are college graduate jobs.\n\nThey\u2019re actually being filled. One of the places where we have a shortage of workers is people with five years\u2019 experience. What were people doing five years ago? They weren\u2019t getting hired. And so we don\u2019t have people with five years\u2019 experience. So, in many cases, you\u2019re seeing someone who has a lot of experience being brought in, maybe at lower pay, but better than no pay, or someone with very little experience being paid low, but now being trained.\n\nAnd that puts money into training. There is some mismatch and things like that. But we\u2019re starting to see \u2014 this year, we did start to finally see some of those full-time jobs come back. Not enough. We still are far too reliant on part-time. We still are far too reliant on minimum-wage jobs.\n\nAnd quality matters as much as quantity when you\u2019re generating jobs because you really need to see wages pick up. The majority of households are still trying to regain ground lost to the great recession. And that\u2019s something we have to keep into perspective, context.\n\nThis might be the best year of job generation since 1999, but 1999 was a year we were running out of people to employ.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Right. Right.\n\nDIANE SWONK: That isn\u2019t not the economy we\u2019re in today.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And so when you talk about that minimum-wage job or when you talk about those low hourly wages, they\u2019re not even keeping up with what really has to happen for inflation, right?\n\nDIANE SWONK: Some of them are not, absolutely not.\n\nSome of them will see minimum wages go up. Some 25 states have been going up in \u2014 half the states in 2015. In terms of what happens, if you\u2019re working two jobs, it\u2019s a lot harder to manage working two jobs instead of one job. So even if your minimum wage goes up, if you have these other issues holding hours down, again still difficult.\n\nWe really need to see. These were nice broad-based gains. That\u2019s good. We need to see a lot more of those, and an extended period of time of wages, not 2 percent gains from a year ago, but 3 percent-plus to really start regaining ground lost. And that\u2019s the key. And I think we might be able to get there, start getting there in 2015, but we still have got a long way to go.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Diane Swonk with Mesirow Financial, thanks so much.\n\nDIANE SWONK: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Job growth surged last month, with more than 300,000 new positions added.
