Lamar Alexander (R-TN) in an August 7th primary, is seeing signs of momentum.\n\nSeven more Tennessee state representatives endorsed Carr on Monday, a week after Laura Ingraham, who helped propel Brat to his victory, praised Carr on her radio show.\n\nMiddle Tennessee Representatives Sheila Butt (R-Columbia), Judd Matheny (R-Tullahoma), Mark Pody (R-Lebanon), Courtney Rogers (R-Goodlettsville), Mike Sparks (R-Smyrna), Billy Spivey (R-Lewisburg), and Rick Womick (R-Rockvale) said Carr could repeat the successes of Brat and Mississippi Sen. Chris McDaniel, who took incumbent Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS) to a runoff. Recent polling shows McDaniel leading Cochran by eight points.\n\nOn behalf of the group, Matheny, who is also chairs a committee in the state legislature, said that Alexander\u2019s vote to \u201csupport and confirm the person hand-picked by President Obama to implement Obamacare shows us just how out-of-touch he has become.\u201d\n\nCarr said that \u201cwithout a meaningful change in leadership, Obamacare will continue to impose on all of us, the Obama-Alexander climate change regulations will drive businesses away, and amnesty will become law.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe choice in this election is very clear: a vote for Sen. Alexander is a vote to support a status-quo agenda that working families in Tennessee don\u2019t want,\u201d Carr continued. \u201cVoters in Mississippi have rejected the establishment, voters in Virginia have rejected the status-quo, and now it\u2019s time for voters in Tennessee to take a leadership role in this movement for change.\u201d\n\nCarr appeared on Breitbart News Sunday with Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow and hammered Alexander on amnesty, as Brat and McDaniel have also been doing to their opponents.\n\nCarr asserted that with Alexander\u2019s support of the Senate\u2019s amnesty bill, he\u2013like Obama\u2013has allowed illegal immigrants to assault the nation\u2019s sovereignty.\n\nCarr also said that his campaign has traveled around Tennessee for the last year building a grassroots network of supporters with the belief that there would be a \u201cseminal and catalyst event that was going to turn everything upside down\u201d before the August primary.\n\nCantor\u2019s victory was that moment, and Carr said it instantly gave his campaign a shot in the arm.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Joe Carr Gaining Endorsements and Momentum against Lamar Alexander", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Joe Carr Gaining Endorsements and Momentum against Lamar Alexander", "title": "Joe Carr Gaining Endorsements and Momentum against Lamar Alexander - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/08/20/joecarrAP2jpg.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/06/16/joe-carr-gaining-endorsements-momentum-against-lamar-alexander/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Joe Carr Gaining Endorsements and Momentum against Lamar Alexander", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/08/20/joecarrAP2jpg.jpg", "title": "Joe Carr Gaining Endorsements and Momentum against Lamar Alexander - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Lamar Alexander, Senate, Thad Cochran,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Thad Cochran", "published_time": "2014-06-16T09:54:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Seven more Tennessee state representatives endorsed Carr on Monday, a week after Laura Ingraham, who helped propel Brat to his victory, praised Carr on her radio show.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAfter Dave Brat\u2019s stunning upset over House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA) last week, Joe Carr, a Tennessee state representative who is challenging moderate Republican Sen.
