That's up from $227 million in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.\n\nThe latest schedule of penalties, an accountability measure built into the Affordable Care Act, was first reported earlier this month by Kaiser Health News. Kaiser said 39 hospitals around the country will be assessed the maximum 3 percent of their Medicare reimbursements. The fines are based on readmissions from July 2010 through June 2013.\n\nNo Florida hospital faces the maximum penalty, but two will be penalized more than 2 percent: St. Vincent's Medical Center Southside in Jacksonville (2.9 percent) and St. Lucie Medical Center in Port St. Lucie (2.4 percent). Another 27 \u2014 including Wuesthoff Medical Center-Melbourne \u2014 will be penalized 1 to 2 percent.\n\nSupporters of the controversial 2010 health care law, which congressional Republicans have tried repeatedly to gut or repeal, say the law did the right thing in making hospitals accountable for their former patients.\n\n\"It's a prime example of an ACA provision that promotes system improvements in a manner that will simultaneously increase health outcomes and lower costs,\" said Greg Mellowe, policy director for Florida CHAIN, a consumer health advocacy group.\n\nThe 148 hospitals with higher-than-acceptable readmission rates in Florida represent 79 percent of the state's eligible medical centers, the sixth-highest percentage in the nation. The average penalty assessed against hospitals in the state is 0.58 percent, slightly below the national average of 0.63 percent, according to Kaiser.\n\nThree Brevard hospitals topped the state average: Wuesthoff-Melbourne (1 percent), Health First Cape Canaveral Hospital (0.9 percent) and Wuesthoff-Rockledge (0.9 precent).\n\nFor the second consecutive year, Parrish Medical Center in Titusville was not penalized.\n\nLast year, 80 percent of Florida hospitals made the list, with an average penalty of 0.35 percent, a little below the national average of 0.38 percent.\n\nThe Medicare penalty program began in October 2012 under the Affordable Care Act to control the growth of health care costs. Medicare estimates it spends $17 billion annually on preventable readmissions, according to Kaiser Health News.\n\nThe first two years of penalties were assessed on hospitals for readmissions of patients originally treated for pneumonia, heart failure or acute myocardial infarction.\n\nThis year's penalties added readmissions of patients were treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or elective surgery to replace a hip or knee.\n\nBeginning in October 2016, hospitals also will be penalized for excessive readmissions of patients who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery.\n\nThe percentage of 30-day readmissions that triggers a penalty varies, based on a hospital's size and the specific reason for readmission. Nationally, Medicare considers the threshold to be 23 percent for heart failure, 21.1 percent for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 17.9 percent for acute myocardial infarction, 17.7 percent for pneumonia, and 5.27 percent for total joint replacement of a hip or knee.\n\n\"We think that reducing readmissions is an important goal,\" said Akin Demehin, senior director of policy for the American Hospital Association.\n\nHospitals are looking at their discharge planning processes and are working with people in their communities to focus on preventable readmissions.\n\nThe American Hospital Association, however, also says the penalty program needs to take into account the difficulties faced by teaching hospitals and larger hospitals in urban areas with high poverty rates. Also, former patients readmitted for an unrelated medical condition \u2014 such as a car accident \u2014 should not be counted in assessing penalties, Demehin said.\n\nMellowe with Florida CHAIN said hospitals' ability to improve their readmission rates have been hampered by the state's refusal to expand Medicaid. If hospitals received more government money to help defray the expenses of caring for the poor, they could devote more resources to keeping elderly patients from coming back, he said.\n\n\"The challenge is that the burden falls squarely on hospitals that are already anchoring the system and feeling financial pressure from many other factors outside their control, such as, in Florida's case, the legislature's continued rejection of the Medicaid expansion that is also called for in the ACA,\" Mellowe said.\n\nBrevard readmission penalties\n\nHospital\n\n2015\n\n2014\n\nWuesthoff-Melb.\n\n1.01 percent\n\n.35 percent\n\nCape Canaveral\n\n.91 percent\n\n.08 percent\n\nWuesthoff-Rockledge\n\n.89 percent\n\n1.07 percent\n\nPalm Bay\n\n.20 percent\n\n.03 percent\n\nViera\n\n.09 percent\n\n.10 percent\n\nParrish\n\nNo penalty\n\nNo penalty\n\nSource: Kaiser Health News\n\nHighest readmissions\n\nThese 10 states have the largest percentage of hospitals being penalized in fiscal 2014 for excessive readmission rates based on the three-year period ending June 30.\n\nNew Jersey 98 percent\n\nConn. 88 percent\n\nDelaware 86 percent\n\nMass. 80 percent\n\nNew York 80 percent\n\nFlorida 79 percent\n\nAlabama 76 percent\n\nVirginia 76 percent\n\nPenn. 72 percent\n\nTennessee 72 percent\n\nSource: Kaiser Health News\n\nBrevard hospitals respond\n\n\"As the requirements are annually adjusted to meet changing demand, we continue to focus on improving our quality of outcomes and customer experience.
