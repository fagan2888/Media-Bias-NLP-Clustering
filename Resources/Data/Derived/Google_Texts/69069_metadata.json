They were brought back together by one brother\u2019s love, and a country \u2013 Canada \u2013 willing to help them.\n\nBeneath shiny garlands and a blinking star atop a Christmas tree, the four Chehadeh brothers, their wives and their children gathered in a suburban Montreal living room on Friday to mark a miracle of sorts. After years of turmoil and displacement, of fear and uncertainty, three of the brothers and their families from Syria landed in Canada late this year to start rebuilding their lives.\n\nTwo brothers arrived on a commercial flight Nov. 17. One arrived on a military flight Dec. 12. The fourth brother, a Montrealer who sponsored them, was on the ground each time to greet them. And on Friday, the four brothers \u2013 Tareq, Sohail, Wael and Mousa \u2013 celebrated Christmas together under the same roof for the first time in six years.\n\n\u201cThis was my dream, to get my whole family here,\u201d 45-year-old Tareq said. \u201cIt means everything to know they are safe and secure. I want to give them a chance in life, and I know that Canada is the best place to do that.\u201d\n\nTareq\u2019s wife, Merna, compared the four to children who needed a mother to embrace them. \u201cCanada is the mother,\u201d she said, \u201cthe mother that could bring all the families together.\u201d\n\nAnd so, on a snow-free Christmas day on a curving street in Laval, north of Montreal, 15 members of the extended Chehadeh clan, ages 5 to 51, squeezed onto couches in Tareq and Merna\u2019s living room. The children reached into crisp gift bags prepared by Merna to pull out child-sized knapsacks they will use when they begin school in January, after years of disruption in their schooling.\n\nIt was an act of family kindness played out in Canadian homes across the country over the holidays. Yet it took the single-minded determination and generosity of Tareq Chehadeh to make it happen.\n\nTareq arrived penniless in Montreal with a civil engineering degree from Damascus University in 2002. He found work at minimum wage as a manual labourer in a textile factory in Montreal, persuading the manager to let him work part-time so he could go to school. He obtained a master\u2019s degree in engineering from Concordia University. He picked up lessons that he shared with his brothers before they headed for Canada.\n\n\u201cThe unknown can scare you, but be brave. You can\u2019t succeed if you don\u2019t try,\u201d Tareq told them. \u201cPeople in Canada are generous and kind, and this land and society are open to everybody. Go forward, don\u2019t look back, and you will succeed.\u201d\n\nTareq became a senior project manager at engineering giant SNC-Lavalin in Montreal, until he was laid off six months ago. Regardless of his own hardships, he has devoted himself to helping settle his brothers, who were forced to flee to Lebanon a year ago when the chaos in Syria left them fearing for their safety. A sister in Lebanon, also sponsored by Tareq, is due to arrive in Montreal early next year.\n\nTareq and Merna have been working from early morning to late at night to help each brother get on his feet, registering the children in school, filling out government paperwork, looking for apartments to rent, hunting down affordable, used furniture. Two brothers are living with them until they find housing.\n\nTareq managed to find a job for one brother, Sohail, only two weeks after he arrived in Canada; Sohail, who was a sales representative for Samsung in Syria, is working in the butcher department at Adonis, a popular supermarket chain. The brothers are all getting signed up for French-language classes. They are eager to start contributing to Canadian society.\n\nAs they prepared to sit down to a festive meal of kibbeh, shakriya and tabouleh, with wine to toast their good fortune, the Chehadeh brothers took stock of the new land that has greeted them. The last time they marked Christmas together was when Tareq was able to fly to Syria in 2009.\n\nWael, who had been a film lighting specialist in Syria, had heard about Canada\u2019s record on human rights and its belief in equality before he emigrated. Since arriving, he has been struck by how respectfully he has been treated by public officials. He marvels at the abundance of birds and squirrels he sees in the park across the street from Tareq\u2019s house. Wael is even impressed by how well people on the street treat their dogs. If they treat their animals so well, he mused, it tells you how well they treat their fellow human beings.\n\nBut Wael saved his biggest praise for his older brother, Tareq, whose persistence brought the Chehadehs together. Tareq\u2019s beard may be too short, his brother said, but as far as his spirit of giving, he really was the family\u2019s Santa.\n\nReport Typo/Error", "article_metadata": {"website": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com", "application-artifactId": "gam-webapp", "application-version": "14.0.339", "description": "First brother to arrive in Canada from Syria succeeds in sponsoring three siblings and their families to join him in Montreal", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=429228415", "og": {"site_name": "The Globe and Mail", "description": "First brother to arrive in Canada from Syria succeeds in sponsoring three siblings and their families to join him in Montreal", "title": "One man\u2019s drive to reunite his family in Montreal after years of turmoil as refugees", "url": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/one-mans-drive-to-reunite-his-family-in-montreal-after-years-of-turmoil-as-refugees/article27939506/", "image": {"width": 400, "secure_url": "https://sec.images.theglobeandmail.com/media/www/images/flag/gam-square.png", "type": "image/png", "identifier": "http://static.theglobeandmail.ca/f73/news/national/article27939505.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/syria-reunion25nw1.JPG", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "First brother to arrive in Canada from Syria succeeds in sponsoring three siblings and their families to join him in Montreal", "creator": "@globeandmail", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tgam://article/27939506", "iphone": "tgam://article/27939506"}, "country": "CA", "name": {"ipad": "The Globe And Mail", "iphone": "The Globe And Mail"}, "id": {"ipad": 429228415, "iphone": 429228415}}, "site": "@globeandmail", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512948019}, "robots": "noarchive", "last-modified": "2015-12-25 08:24:16 EST", "fb": {"app_id": 126045934076200}, "location": "Canada", "application-contextName": "globeandmail", "keywords": "Canada;Syria;Lebanon;Montreal, Quebec;Concordia University;refugees;sponsors;family;reunite;", "article": {"onpage": 1, "engagement": "true", "comments": "false", "pages": 1, "type": "news", "id": 27939506}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "identifier-URL": "http://www.theglobeandmail.com"}, "article_summary": "But Wael saved his biggest praise for his older brother, Tareq, whose persistence brought the Chehadehs together.\nYet it took the single-minded determination and generosity of Tareq Chehadeh to make it happen.\nTareq arrived penniless in Montreal with a civil engineering degree from Damascus University in 2002.\nTwo brothers arrived on a commercial flight Nov. 17.\nAnd on Friday, the four brothers \u2013 Tareq, Sohail, Wael and Mousa \u2013 celebrated Christmas together under the same roof for the first time in six years."}
