Waiting for the free alcohol, partygoers passed three lonely digital tablets plastered to the wall, watched over by two stylish security guards. A dancer jumped from a beam on the ceiling straight into a split. The Windows 8 interface of the tablets on the wall, which remained mostly untouched throughout the night, were the only signal that the whole strange spectacle had an unlikely sponsor: Microsoft.\n\nThe dance performance was part of Microsoft\u2019s 1MSQFT project, which stands for \u201c1 Million Square Feet of Culture\u201d; its website features the boggling tag line \u201ca series of guest curated physical spaces that live on through technology,\u201d but it is actually an event series designed to sneakily hype the Microsoft brand. The particular square feet chosen by Microsoft and its partners to survey are usually tied to high-end cultural destinations, like Sundance, New York Fashion Week or, in the case where I encountered it, the New Orleans Jazz Fest.\n\nTwo days later at a different event put on by 1MSQFT in New Orleans, I sat on bleachers facing an abandoned dirt lot filled with ATVs, men on horseback and young white women twerking out of the back of a tricked-out convertible. Bounce music and hip-hop blared from a stage over a hundred yards away. A drone hovered above the spectacle, capturing the whole thing for promotional purposes. \u201cThis is all about individuality and expression,\u201d shouted the emcee. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do here!\u201d Once again, the funder of the whole strange event remained far away from the action, relegating its products to a warehouse on the other side of the bleachers. Microsoft did as much as it could to stay away from the experience it spent over a million dollars to create.\n\nMicrosoft has, for the past few years, made no secret of its energetic campaign to be cool. The company recently unveiled its new tablet, the unsexily named Surface Pro 3, with space-age promotional spots that lingered on the tablet\u2019s sleek curves without quite explaining what the product actually does. Ads for a previous edition of Surface Pro feature Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson beneath the words \u201cI stay on my game with Surface Pro 2.\u201d But the 1MSQFT project was different: It barely mentioned Microsoft at all. Ed Chase, senior global event manager for Microsoft Windows, explained: \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is a big Microsoft logo or a lot of branding throughout the venue, because that will change how you consume the content inside the project. You end up caring more about the brand that is trying to dominate the space.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s nothing new about corporations and their marketers using cultural trends to appeal to younger consumers. What\u2019s different about the 1MSQFT project is that it tries as hard as possible to hide the very brand it seeks to promote. Started out of a brainstorm in 2012 about how best to promote its flailing tablet products, 1MSQFT has already worked with tastemakers like Pitchfork, La Blogotheque and Lucky Peach.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Twerking, dirt bike racing, men on horseback -- the strange, wild world of ragers secretly sponsored by Microsoft", "author": "Max Rivlin-Nadler", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Twerking, dirt bike racing, men on horseback -- the strange, wild world of ragers secretly sponsored by Microsoft", "title": "The crazy parties Microsoft doesn\u2019t want you to know it\u2019s having", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/02/the_crazy_parties_microsoft_doesnt_want_you_to_know_its_having/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/bill_gates.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Twerking, dirt bike racing, men on horseback -- the strange, wild world of ragers secretly sponsored by Microsoft", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/02/bill_gates.jpg", "title": "The crazy parties Microsoft doesn\u2019t want you to know it\u2019s having", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The crazy parties Microsoft doesn\u2019t want you to know it\u2019s having", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1MSQFT, Bill Gates, Microsoft, new orleans jazz fest", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd6e3\"", "article_summary": "What\u2019s different about the 1MSQFT project is that it tries as hard as possible to hide the very brand it seeks to promote.\nMicrosoft did as much as it could to stay away from the experience it spent over a million dollars to create.\nAds for a previous edition of Surface Pro feature Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson beneath the words \u201cI stay on my game with Surface Pro 2.\u201d But the 1MSQFT project was different: It barely mentioned Microsoft at all.\nMicrosoft has, for the past few years, made no secret of its energetic campaign to be cool.\nWaiting for the free alcohol, partygoers passed three lonely digital tablets plastered to the wall, watched over by two stylish security guards."}
