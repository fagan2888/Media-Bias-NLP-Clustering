Being bound to a wheelchair due to a terminal breast cancer diagnosis, Manning\u2019s hope for a slow dance at her son\u2019s wedding had seemed to dwindle in the past couple of months, leading up to the Sept. 5 wedding date. Three days before her death on Sept. 8, Manning was able to muster up all of her strength to join her son on the dance floor to the all too fitting tune of \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow.\"\n\n\"It was very special,\" Manning\u2019s son Ryan told KUTV. \u201cI think that everybody kind of realized what they were seeing and what they were seeing was an incredibly strong woman doing a magnificent thing. A miracle. There is absolutely no doubt that that woman, a very strong woman, fought incredibly hard to get to that point.\"\n\nA video uploaded to YouTube by Manning\u2019s daughter Kristie shows Manning up on her feet dancing with her son only a few months after being confined to a wheelchair and finding out she had very little time to live. Although it\u2019s hard to tell from the footage, there\u2019s no denying the lack of dry eyes at the wedding reception. When Manning passed away three days later, above all, her three children were left with an everlasting memory of their mother\u2019s strength and courage that supersedes the condition her illness left her in.\n\n\u201cMary Ann Manning lost her battle with breast cancer just 3 days after this dance,\u201d Kristie wrote in the video description. \u201cShe held on with all her might to give her son this last gift. It's really the epitome of a mother's love. She now joins her other baby boy, who passed four years ago, in heaven.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mary, ann, manning, mother, terminal, cancer, dance, wedding", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A mother from Dublin, Calif., with terminal breast cancer diagnosis ditched her wheelchair to dance with her son at his wedding.", "title": "Mom Fights Cancer Just Long Enough To Dance At Son's Wedding [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/california-mom-mary-ann-manning-fights-dance-sons-wedding-3-days-her-death-304578", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/mary-ann-manning.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A mother from Dublin, Calif., with terminal breast cancer diagnosis ditched her wheelchair to dance with her son at his wedding.", "title": "Mom Fights Cancer Just Long Enough To Dance At Son's Wedding [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/california-mom-mary-ann-manning-fights-dance-sons-wedding-3-days-her-death-304578", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/mary-ann-manning.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/23/mary-ann-manning.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-23T17:01:25-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-23T17:01:25-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A mother from Dublin, Calif., with terminal breast cancer diagnosis ditched her wheelchair to dance with her son at his wedding."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbcee\"", "article_summary": "Mary Ann Manning wanted only what most mothers look forward to in their child\u2019s life \u2014 to dance at his or her wedding.\n\u201cMary Ann Manning lost her battle with breast cancer just 3 days after this dance,\u201d Kristie wrote in the video description.\n\"It was very special,\" Manning\u2019s son Ryan told KUTV.\nThere is absolutely no doubt that that woman, a very strong woman, fought incredibly hard to get to that point.\"\nAlthough it\u2019s hard to tell from the footage, there\u2019s no denying the lack of dry eyes at the wedding reception."}
