But that doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s been wholesale adoption among healthcare facilities.\n\nFor one, the perceived cost of converting double patient rooms to private has prevented some organizations from making the shift. In addition, uncertainly in the marketplace over the Affordable Care Act and reimbursement rates has driven many facilities to table constructon projects, including new patient towers, until a later date and instead pursue smaller, ambulatory facilities to deliver care.\n\nBut not everyone sees a lost opportunity. \u201cThe push toward ambulatory care is decreasing inpatient days in hospitals while increasing the acuity level,\u201d says Adrian Hagerty, regional vice president of Array Architects (Washington, D.C.). \u201cThis simply increases the pressure to go to all private rooms.\u201d\n\nHagerty and colleague Patricia Malick, practice area leader, interior design, at Array Architects, will discuss this push in the session \u201cYour Aging Patient Bed Tower\u2014Top Ten Considerations When Renovating\u201c at the Healthcare Design Healthcare Design Conference (Nov. 15-18 at the San Diego Convention Center, San Diego).\n\nHagerty says there\u2019s an opportunity for hospitals to increase the quality of the patient experience by decreasing their total number of beds and moving from semi-private to private rooms. But that doesn\u2019t mean a bed can be removed from a double room and the transition\u2019s complete; rather, when a facility converts, there are many challenges involved that relate to operations, facility planning, and even changes to the nursing ratio.\n\nTo help navigate this renovation process, Hagerty and Malick compiled a list of top considerations, including:\n\nLogistics\u2014 More often than not, facilities will need to make physical changes to facilitate efficient operations of a new patient unit.\n\nMore often than not, facilities will need to make physical changes to facilitate efficient operations of a new patient unit. Life safety\u2014 Knowing how to plan and execute interim life safety measures will help reduce disruptions in patient care and hospital operations during the renovation process.\n\nKnowing how to plan and execute interim life safety measures will help reduce disruptions in patient care and hospital operations during the renovation process. Patient/family-involved care\u2014A patient tower renovation provides an opportunity for older facilities to reinvent the patient experience, by introducing new amenties and layouts that allow family members to participate in the caregiving process.\n\nThe two will share their full list during their session and use recent case studies to illustrate the challenges and solutions involved in these types of renovation projects.\n\n\n\nAdrian Hagerty\n\n\n\nPatricia Malick\n\nFor more information of the Healthcare Design Conference, Nov. 15-18 at the San Diego Convention Center, San Diego, visit HCDconference.com.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "[page-title],[metatags-global-keywords-1],Remodel / Renovation,Evidence-based Design,Construction,Engineering,Healthcare Reform,Post-occupancy Evaluations,Small hospitals,Large hospitals,Design Ideas,Infection Control,Rooms: Patient/Exam,HEALTHCARE DESIGN Conference,HCD Conference Coverage", "revisit-after": "1 day", "description": "[site-name],[site-mission]"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b68\"", "article_summary": "The benefits of private patient rooms are widely understood, from improving patient satisfaction to reducing healthcare-associated infections.\nFor one, the perceived cost of converting double patient rooms to private has prevented some organizations from making the shift.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s been wholesale adoption among healthcare facilities.\nAdrian HagertyPatricia MalickFor more information of the Healthcare Design Conference, Nov. 15-18 at the San Diego Convention Center, San Diego, visit HCDconference.com.\nKnowing how to plan and execute interim life safety measures will help reduce disruptions in patient care and hospital operations during the renovation process."}
