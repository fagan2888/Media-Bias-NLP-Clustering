Under Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy law, only a \"municipality\" may file for relief -- meaning a political subdivision or public agency or instrumentality of a state. Commonwealths or territories of the U.S. are not covered.\n\nEarlier this week, Democratic Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut announced they would introduce legislation to extend Chapter 9 federal bankruptcy protection to Puerto Rico, despite strong opposition from some Republicans and lukewarm support from the Obama administration.\n\nThe bill would be a companion to one introduced in the House by Pedro Pierluisi, Puerto Rico\u2019s Democratic non-voting member of Congress. That proposed legislation has been backed by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). Schumer, who is in line to succeed Harry Reid as the next Democratic leader in the Senate, said that he and Blumenthal are in the market for a Republican co-sponsor to try to move the bill after Congress returns from the July 4th recess.\n\n\u201cSenator Blumenthal and I will introduce this bill either way, but we are hoping to get Republican co-sponsors to make this bill bipartisan\u201d\u200e Schumer said Tuesday in a statement.\n\nRelated: How the U.S. Is Helping to Sink Puerto Rico\n\nIn a televised speech on Monday, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, Puerto Rico\u2019s beleaguered governor, acknowledged that \u2013 like Greece \u2013 the commonwealth is in the throes of its worst financial crisis in modern times. A combination of years of profligate spending, unwise borrowing to close huge gaps in the budget, high unemployment and poverty on the island of 3.6 million people has generated more municipal debt per capita than any U.S. state, The New York Times observed. Padilla called for a major debt restructuring that would force creditors to take a substantial haircut.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest this week strongly ruled out a federal bailout but said that Congress should consider granting Puerto Rico the ability to declare Chapter 9 bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cPuerto Rico currently has no access to a tested restructuring regime for any of its public debt,\u201d Earnest told reporters. \u201cSo there are strong merits to having an orderly mechanism for Puerto Rico to manage the financial challenges of its public corporations if needed. And so we\u2019ve urged Congress to take a close look at this particular issue.\u201d\n\nRelated: Puerto Rico Needs Debt Restructuring, Reforms: Economists' Report\n\nLast month, Puerto Rico hired Steven W. Rhodes, the retired federal judge who skillfully oversaw Detroit\u2019s massive bankruptcy case. Puerto Rico officials are also consulting with a group of bankers from Citicorp who advised Detroit on a $1.5 billion debt exchange with some of the Motor City\u2019s creditors. Rhodes told The New York Times that Chapter 9 is needed for the commonwealth in responding to its debt crisis.\n\nEfforts to extend Chapter 9 to Puerto Rico likely will face strong resistance from some conservative Republicans who have argued that allowing it to restructure its debts in bankruptcy court would be tantamount to forgiving decades of mismanagement by local government officials.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Debt-ridden Puerto Rico got a bit of good news on Tuesday when the Puerto Rico Electri", "title": "Republicans Balk at Tossing Puerto Rico a Lifeline", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/02/Republicans-Balk-Tossing-Puerto-Rico-Lifeline", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04282015_Puerto_Rico_Flag.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/02/Republicans-Balk-Tossing-Puerto-Rico-Lifeline", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04282015_Puerto_Rico_Flag.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Debt-ridden Puerto Rico got a bit of good news on Tuesday when the Puerto Rico Electri", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cPuerto Rico currently has no access to a tested restructuring regime for any of its public debt,\u201d Earnest told reporters.\n\u201cSo there are strong merits to having an orderly mechanism for Puerto Rico to manage the financial challenges of its public corporations if needed.\nAnd so we\u2019ve urged Congress to take a close look at this particular issue.\u201dRelated: Puerto Rico Needs Debt Restructuring, Reforms: Economists' ReportLast month, Puerto Rico hired Steven W.
