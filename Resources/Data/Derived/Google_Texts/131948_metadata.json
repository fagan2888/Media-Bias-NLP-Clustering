Now a federal health advisory committee recommends that the FDA ease that ban, saying that men who have not had sex with another man for a year may donate blood.\n\nHank Greely is a professor of law and medicine at Stanford and directs the Center for Law and the Biosciences. He reminded listeners of how little we knew about AIDS when the ban was first put in place. \u201cNo one really knew what caused AIDS\u201d at that time, he said. \u201cThey did know people were getting the disease from transfusions, and that gay men were one of the groups that had the highest incidence of the disease.\u201d\n\nBut pretty quickly, the HIV virus was identified and tests were developed to see if donated blood contained antibodies to the virus \u2014 indicating the donor was infected with HIV. Originally, Greely said, that process took a couple months, but over the intervening years that window has shrunk to 11 days.\n\nGreely says that, in theory, the waiting period for a man who has had sex with another man to be eligible to donate blood could be shrunk to two weeks. \u201cA year seems a little strong,\u201d Greely said, \u201cbut the idea of a waiting period is not crazy. It\u2019s an idea to try to prevent undetected and undetectable HIV-contaminated blood from getting into the blood transfusion system.\u201d\n\nRyan James Yezak with the National Gay Blood Drive thinks any ban is discriminatory, but agrees that the change is a step in the right direction. \u201cPeople who need blood don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s straight blood or gay blood,\u201d he said. \u201cBlood is blood. They want safe blood, and that is something our community has to offer.\u201d\n\nSome advocates are pushing for a behavior-based risk assessment. such as banning anyone who has recently had unsafe sex. Italy has such a ban in place. Greely said moving to this kind of assessment might be the next step.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s important to remember, in blood donation, there are a lot of categories that are excluded or at least deferred,\u201d said Greely, who pointed out that people who have gotten a tattoo may not donate for a year. People who were in Great Britain during the time of the mad cow disease outbreak are banned for life.\n\n\u201cThere are a variety of these exclusions,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat makes this one particularly sensitive is that it\u2019s an exclusion that taps into a preexisting group that has a history of being discriminated against.\u201d\n\nGreely said he thinks the change would be \u201cclearly better\u201d than the status quo. And that the one-year deferral could be \u201ccut down from a safety perspective to something shorter.\u201d\n\nBut he also said that the concern about diseases being transmitted through blood is \u201ca real one and has had some tragic consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout half of the hemophiliacs alive in the United States in 1982 contracted AIDS as a result of blood product transfusions that were contaminated with HIV,\u201d he said. \u201cThousands of people got AIDS through transfusions, so the recommendations coming out about blood transfusions are based on an appropriate desire to maximize the safety of those transfusions.\u201d\n\nWhether the U.S. should move to a behavior-based risk assessment is a good question, he said. \u201cBut it is beyond question that the proposed move is a lot better than the status quo.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Men who have sex with men have been banned from donating blood since 1983.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"FDA Considers Lifting Ban on Gay Men Donating Blood\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/12\\/01\\/fda-considers-lifting-ban-on-gay-men-donating-blood\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-12-01 17:25:42\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-12-02 10:16:37\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":22759,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"HIV\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Policy\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2014\\/12\\/iStock_000003109765_Large-e1417483484694.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Men who have sex with men have been banned from donating blood since 1983.", "title": "FDA Considers Lifting Ban on Gay Men Donating Blood", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/12/01/fda-considers-lifting-ban-on-gay-men-donating-blood/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2014/12/iStock_000003109765_Large-640x425.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "hiv", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cPeople who need blood don\u2019t care whether it\u2019s straight blood or gay blood,\u201d he said.\nBy Mina Kim and Peter ShulerThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will consider Tuesday lifting a 31-year-old ban on blood donations from gay men.\nOriginally fueled by fear and little understanding of AIDS, federal regulators in 1983 banned donations from men who have sex with men.\nNow a federal health advisory committee recommends that the FDA ease that ban, saying that men who have not had sex with another man for a year may donate blood.\n\u201cBlood is blood."}
