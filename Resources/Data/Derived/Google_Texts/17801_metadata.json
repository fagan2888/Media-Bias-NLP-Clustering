Private insurance, state or federal health exchange programs, and an expanded Medicaid system will cover most people. But others will fall through the cracks, remaining uninsured and living without access to health services.\n\nThe \u201ccoverage gap\u201d will include those who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but too little to gain federal subsidies to buy private insurance. This includes 6.4 million people who live in states that chose not to expand Medicaid coverage. Add to this group the people who will inevitably feel that monthly insurance premiums are too expensive and will decide to pay an increasing annual fee instead.\n\nSo where do the low-income, uninsured go for the health services they need? One organization based in suburban Illinois feels it has the solution.\n\nIs Charity Care the Answer?\n\nAccess DuPage, located in DuPage County just outside of Chicago, Ill., provides medical care to low-income, uninsured county residents. The organization has been successful in caring for local residents and believes its system can be duplicated in other parts of the country.\n\nUnlike community clinics, which charge patients on a sliding, income-based scale, Access DuPage partnered with area hospital volunteers, community clinics, and free clinics to not only provide an array of cheap services but also to give enrolled patients a \u201cmedical home\u201d for ongoing primary care.\n\nAccess DuPage executive director Kara Murphy told Healthline, \u201cWe differ from free clinics because of our comprehensiveness.\u201d The group charges minimal co-pays for care and medications and works with local specialists to provide advanced care. \u201cWe will almost always be able to get patients everything that they absolutely need,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nAccording to an Access DuPage community report, the average direct cost of its program was about $450 per member per year in 2012. The key to the organization\u2019s success is charity care. \u201cEvery single hospital donates finances and services,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt\u2019s the magic elixir for our service.\u201d\n\nAccess DuPage provides some services directly, but acts more as \u201cthe glue\u201d that links federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), free clinics, and private doctors. In its system, private physicians control how many patients they see. The 13-year-old program also utilizes free clinic volunteers, some of whom have been with the program since the beginning.\n\nBut can the program work on a larger scale? Murphy offers a qualified yes. \u201cI hope that every community can do something like we do, but assets and challenges of that community will dictate their attention,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t look the same everywhere.\u201d\n\nMurphy also noted that DuPage County is unique. The community lacked services for its low-income population, but was rich in health care assets. It is a relatively affluent, politically conservative community. \u201cBeing private in funding and volunteerism makes the program attractive to the community,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nDoing 'Our Fair Share'\n\nWhen Access DuPage began, the organization asked local providers, \u201cWhat if we all did our fair share?\u201d The message resonated with both private and public partners.\n\nYet health services for low-income and uninsured people are not new. In Oakland, Calif., an organization called La Cl\u00ednica has served its community since 1971. Since then, the organization has grown to include 32 sites across three counties.\n\nPatients at La Cl\u00ednica\u2014which include the under- and uninsured, undocumented workers, and others\u2014pay for health services on a sliding scale. Unlike Access DuPage, it does not rely on volunteerism but rather on federal programs, state funds, grants, and a small amount from patients.\n\nWhen asked if the Access DuPage model is feasible on a national scale, La Cl\u00ednica doctor Kristen Miranda, M.D., told Healthline, \u201cI think the fact that there is such a shortage of primary care providers across the nation would make it hard to get enough volunteers to cover the need.\u201d\n\nShe also noted that community health clinics, which are located throughout the country in underserved areas, provide services similar to Access DuPage, in addition to family planning, prenatal, dental, and preventative care.\n\nMurphy admits that Access DuPage has its limits. \u201cWe don\u2019t ever have enough access to what we need when it comes to specialties. But our places of scarcity mirror provider shortages in general.\u201d And as a part of her \u201cqualified yes,\u201d Murphy said, \u201cWe recognize the system\u2019s strengths and limitations. Access DuPage evolved over time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to be pragmatic in the reality of being a program driven by volunteers. There are definitely gaps in what we\u2019ve been able to offer,\u201d explains Murphy. But she also notes many services they don\u2019t offer, like dental care and contraception, are available elsewhere in the community.\n\nBut do the factors that make Access DuPage unique also make it difficult to duplicate? \u201cFor any community, if they\u2019re interested in creating an access model similar to Access DuPage, their best success will stem from their community assets,\u201d says Murphy.\n\nPerhaps DuPage County\u2019s most valuable asset is the community itself \u2013 clinic and physician volunteers who answered the organization\u2019s call.\n\nFor others, and for now, community health centers will have to fill the health services gap.\n\nMore on Healthline", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Access DuPage, Chicago, La Clinica, free clinic, volunteer, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, charity, charity care", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "Access DuPage in Illinois and La Cl\u00ednica in California offer free or low-cost care to the uninsured, but with 6.4 million set to fall into Obamacare coverage gaps, will these charity programs be enough?", "title": "Charity Programs Offer Uninsured Primary Care, but Can They Fill the 'Coverage Gap'?", "url": "http://www.healthline.com/health-news/policy-charity-programs-give-primary-care-but-are-they-enough-091213", "image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/freeclinic.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/News/public-policy/freeclinic.jpg", "description": "Access DuPage in Illinois and La Cl\u00ednica in California offer free or low-cost care to the uninsured, but with 6.4 million set to fall into Obamacare coverage gaps, will these charity programs be enough?", "card": "summary", "title": "Charity Programs Offer Uninsured Primary Care, but Can They Fill the 'Coverage Gap'?"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP", "DC.date.issued": "2013-09-12", "fb": {"app_id": 239371929577489}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Access DuPage in Illinois and La Cl\u00ednica in California offer free or low-cost care to the uninsured, but with 6.4 million set to fall into Obamacare coverage gaps, will these charity programs be enough?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8e2d\"", "article_summary": "For others, and for now, community health centers will have to fill the health services gap.\nAccess DuPage, located in DuPage County just outside of Chicago, Ill., provides medical care to low-income, uninsured county residents.\nPatients at La Cl\u00ednica\u2014which include the under- and uninsured, undocumented workers, and others\u2014pay for health services on a sliding scale.\nSo where do the low-income, uninsured go for the health services they need?\nUnlike Access DuPage, it does not rely on volunteerism but rather on federal programs, state funds, grants, and a small amount from patients."}
