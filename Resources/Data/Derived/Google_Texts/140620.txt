Recent heavy snowfall has increased the chance for avalanches in Coloradoâ€™s high county, especially in backcountry areas near or above treeline.

The Colorado Avalanche Information Center said on Wednesday that snowfall built up on layers of snow from October pose the greatest threat for slab slides.

Skiers reported an 18-inch deep slab avalanche on the west side of Berthoud Pass on Tuesday.

Avalanche danger will be considerable near Vail and in Summit County on Wednesday.
