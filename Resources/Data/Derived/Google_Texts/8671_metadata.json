Just look at the 2009-2010 season\n\nThe men started that season 17-0 and rose as high as No. 1 for the first time ever. But they were unranked by March and lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament. The women rose as high as No. 4 but finished fourth in the Big 12 and also were bounced early from the tournament that year\n\nBoth squads now look rebuilt for the long run, thanks to recruiting that landed big-time players and found a few gems others had overlooked.\n\nThe men have five returning starters and the addition of highly touted freshman forward Myles Turner, who had 26 points, nine rebounds and six blocks Tuesday night against Lipscomb. Turner is arguably Texas\u2019 biggest recruit since Kevin Durant, but even he has to fight for playing time in a Texas\u2019 deep lineup.\n\nHe has yet to start a game despite averaging 12.5 points, second-best on the team.\n\n\u201cI have high expectations for myself, and I\u2019ve lived up to a couple of them,\u201d Turner said. \u201cBut not all of them.\u201d\n\nPerhaps just as important has been the standout play of point guard Isaiah Taylor, who was one of the big surprises in the Big 12 last season. Taylor has been sidelined for nearly a month with a broken left wrist but he is expected to return at some point this season.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Longhorns men and women rolling in 2014", "author": "Jim Vertuno", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Longhorns men and women rolling in 2014", "title": "Longhorns men and women rolling in 2014", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/18/longhorns_men_and_women_rolling_in_2014/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/texas-two-step-basketball.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Longhorns men and women rolling in 2014", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/texas-two-step-basketball.jpeg2-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Longhorns men and women rolling in 2014", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Longhorns men and women rolling in 2014", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "3, making this the first season the Texas men have been ranked in to the top 10 and the women in the top five since late December 2009.\nThe women rose as high as No.\nThere is no guarantee the men (9-1) or women (9-0) can maintain their success.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Texas basketball is rolling \u2014 both the men and the women \u2014 and making a splash among the nation\u2019s best just two seasons after both had seemed to hit bottom.\nJust look at the 2009-2010 seasonThe men started that season 17-0 and rose as high as No."}
