The first of these two columnists will probably never be called to account for the bloodshed and mayhem he has sanctioned in the Middle East. The second, I believe, means well, but by denouncing \u201cIslamophobia\u201d he shows he has accepted as sound a nonsense term that conflates faith and race and equates (well-founded) objections to Islam with prejudice against Muslims as people. And we should never forget that he, like Friedman, supported the Iraq War.\n\nBut what to make of Friedman and Kristof\u2019s seemingly milquetoast colleague, David Brooks? No shame attaches to him, though by publishing his pro-faith columns, he validates a stupendously (if surreptitiously) baleful Weltanschauung that should long ago have disappeared from our world. Brooks, in the face of mounting evidence, has striven tirelessly to bequeath credence to the dangerous notion, ever more antiquated and morally untenable, that believing in something asserted without evidence \u2013 religion \u2014 constitutes a virtue. That valuing faith above reason makes one a better person. That those who have shrugged off \u2013 or laughed away \u2013 the comically outlandish claims advanced by the Abrahamic creeds about our world and origins as a species are the ones with the explaining to do. Should he not be called to account?\n\nI believe so. Moreover, Brooks\u2019 recent Op-Ed, \u201cBuilding Better Secularists,\u201d leaves me no choice, or, better said, offers me an opportunity I cannot pass up for commentary. \u201cBuilding Better Secularists\u201d is nothing less than an anti-religion writer\u2019s dream come true, an essay remarkable for its utter and complete susceptibility to refutation and repudiation. The title hints that Brooks intends to teach us godless folks a thing or two. The result? He succeeds only in beclowning himself by authoring a sanctimoniously gaseous tract that befits not America\u2019s august Paper of Record, but a highbrow version of Watchtower, the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 End-is-Nigh rag once handed out for free by blue-haired little old ladies in tennis shoes in front of speakeasies and liquor shops (and is now available online).\n\nBrooks starts out by noting that those with no religious affiliation now account for a fifth of all Americans and a third of young American adults (a development that, in my view, is to be celebrated). He introduces the sociologist Phil Zuckerman and his \u201cLiving the Secular Life,\u201d a book I unfortunately have not read and so cannot comment on, but that apparently promotes the idea that secularism amounts to a \u201cpositive moral creed\u201d based on two precepts: first, do no harm, and second, help others. Zuckerman, in Brooks\u2019 telling, would have us believe that \u201csecularists seem like genial, low-key people who have discarded metaphysical prejudices and are now leading peaceful and rewarding lives.\u201d That sounds pretty good. But Brooks therein espies a critical flaw: \u201csecular writers are so eager to make the case for their creed, they are minimizing the struggle required to live by it.\u201d\n\nNeither atheism nor secularism advocates a specific way of life (though I understand Zuckerman does in his book, which is fine by me). Atheism espouses no \u201ccreed,\u201d but denotes only the absence of belief in God or gods. Secularism mostly concerns legal prohibitions \u2013 Jefferson\u2019s \u201cwall of separation between church and state,\u201d for example, or France\u2019s far more comprehensive 1905 law of laicit\u00e9 \u2014 against religious folks intruding (as they have ever been wont to do) their foul fables and superstitious rituals into places where they can do great damage \u2013 the courts and schools, for example. One would hope that living free of the tyranny of an imaginary despot in the sky and his money-grubbing minions on earth would allow secularists, as Brooks says, to at least \u201creason their way to proper conduct,\u201d but there is no guarantee of that.\n\nOne thing is certain, though: for the past two millennia, devotees of all the Abrahamic faiths have had more than enough opportunity not only to practice their religions and influence their communities, but to run countries and empires. The results would seem to discredit them: barbarism and murder, civil strife and war, the systematic rape of children, institutionalized obscurantism and misogyny, witch hunts, the cruelest punishments imaginable, the Crusades, the Holy Inquisition, ISIS, Boko Haram, and so on. The point is not than one or another religion is better or more correct, or more guilty or less guilty of producing \u201cbad outcomes\u201d such as the aforementioned, but that all are equally man-made, equally false, equally irrational, and equally capable of being used just as they have been used: as merciless ideologies of control and repression. All this immediately renders null and void the credentials of any journalist who would preach faith-tainted advice about how to live to rationalists.\n\nBrooks proceeds to list the challenges he demands be met if atheists are to prosper. Each of these challenges he presents in contradistinction to its religious equivalent.\n\nLet\u2019s take them one by one.\n\n1. \u201cReligions come equipped with covenantal rituals that bind people together, sacred practices that are beyond individual choice. Secular people have to choose their own communities and come up with their own practices to make them meaningful.\u201d\n\nSince Brooks is Jewish, presumably the circumcision (of baby boys) is the primary \u201ccovenantal ritual\u201d he has in mind. Of course there are other rites: acting out cannibalistic fantasies in the Eucharist, eating wafers for flesh and drinking wine for blood; spouting gibberish in tongues; gyrating on the floor; genuflecting toward Mecca, and so on. (One other particularly savage ritual comes to mind, and it is truly \u201cbeyond individual choice\u201d: female genital mutilation, usually inflicted on its victims \u2013 currently some 125 million women in at least 29 countries \u2014 with license from the Islamic canon.) No atheist is obligated to concoct practices similar to the sacraments Brooks considers necessary for \u201cmeaning,\u201d or, obviously, to the ghoulish outrages other faith-deranged folk make a habit of casually visiting on their fellows. Disbelief in God obliges me to search for no \u201ccommunity\u201d at all. \u201cMeaning\u201d I can discover on my own, without recourse to fallacious dogmas or conferring with the deluded souls who adhere to them.\n\n2. \u201cSecular individuals have to build their own Sabbaths. Religious people are commanded to drop worldly concerns. Secular people have to create their own set times for when to pull back and reflect on spiritual matters.\u201d\n\nI, a lifelong atheist, need a Sabbath? This is news to me. I associate Sabbaths with the punishment \u2013 the death penalty \u2013 that Leviticus and Deuteronomy mete out to the violators thereof. Scheduling time to \u201creflect on spiritual matters\u201d generally poses no problem for anyone who can, let\u2019s say, read a clock. Children usually manage this feat by age 7 or so. If Brooks needs to rely on a magic book\u2019s calendar to help him find time to \u201cpull back,\u201d that\u2019s not my problem.", "article_metadata": {"description": "David Brooks wants us atheists to appreciate his magic book and silly myths.
