The insurance was cancelled and apparently she couldn't re-enroll until 2015. Shannen says during the lapse period she didn't regularly visit doctors, which had been her practice.\n\nIn March 2015, after getting her insurance back, she went to a doctor and discovered she had \"invasive breast cancer metastatic to at least one lymph node.\" She says doctors told her the cancer spread during 2014, when she was uninsured, and she blames her business manager.\n\nShe indicates in the lawsuit she now will likely have to take measures -- including a mastectomy and chemotherapy -- that could have been avoided if the cancer had been caught earlier.\n\nThe docs say she parted ways with the business manager sometime in 2014.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "TMZ.COM", "twitter": {"site": "@TMZ", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "1:55 PM PST: A rep for the firm tells TMZ: \"Tanner Mainstain is saddened to learn that Ms. Doherty is suffering from cancer and wishes her a full\u2026"}, "categoryID": "f2cb2570-104e-4c13-e20e-9186a7708dac, 7a5eae68-c3ef-48c4-efd2-2ee863084434", "msapplication-task": "name=Celebrity Directory;action-uri=http://www.tmz.com/celebrity-directory;icon-uri=http://ll-assets.tmz.com/www.tmz.com/main/default/favicon.png", "news_keywords": "Exclusive, Shannen Doherty, Nurse!", "generator": "Crowd Fusion 2.0-enterprise", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#CF0000", "celebrityID": "63a35125-1584-4399-f06f-e16660772e9d", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "description": "1:55 PM PST: A rep for the firm tells TMZ: \"Tanner Mainstain is saddened to learn that Ms. Doherty is suffering from cancer and wishes her a full\u2026", "msapplication-tooltip": "TMZ | Entertainment News", "robots": "all", "fb": {"app_id": 310610065699820}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.tmz.com?adid=IE9pin", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tmz"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0", "og": {"site_name": "http://www.tmz.com", "description": "1:55 PM PST: A rep for the firm tells TMZ: \"Tanner Mainstain is saddened to learn that Ms. Doherty is suffering from cancer and wishes her a full\u2026", "title": "Shannen Doherty -- Sues Business Manager ...
