Dec., 14, 2014 (Photo: (by Amber Sigman, Special to The Courier-Journal))Buy Photo\n\nThree women giggle and talk wearing striped socks and tutus before running together in the Go Santa Go 5k at Iroquois Park, where a portion of the proceeds will go to support Gilda's Club Louisville.\n\n\"Normally you go out to eat together for the holidays, but we are doing something healthy,\" said runner Donna Foushee, with David T. Wilson Elementary. \"We want to set an example for our students.\"\n\nAbout 80 people came out to support the event, including Deb Strickler who brought a canine companion \u2014 a golden doodle named Jozie, who sits quiet, yet festive, with a Santa Claus hat on her head.\n\n\"We are here to support a good cause,\" Strickler said.\n\nGilda's Club offers free cancer support for anyone living with cancer, including their loved ones. The club is named in memory of Gilda Radner, one of the first cast members of Saturday Night Live, who died of ovarian cancer.\n\n\"They are more than cancer; cancer doesn't define our members,\" said Chelsea Raff, Major Gifts Officer with Gilda's Club Louisville.\n\nShe offers free magnets and pamphlets to guests after their run with inspirational quotes, such as, \"Laughter is good medicine without side effects.\"\n\n\"Everything we offer is free, and we offer over 140 different events per month,\" Raff said.\n\nGilda's Club Louisville offers support groups, yoga, pilates, social events, art classes, educational lectures and other events.\n\n\"We are here for the entire family,\" Raff said. \"Cancer is such a heavy thing to deal with so we try to infuse a sense of humor and whimsy into everything we do.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1DxzXXf", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Runners don beards, hats for 5K in Iroquois Park", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Runners don beards, hats for 5K in Iroquois Park", "title": "Go Santa Go run benefits Gilda's Club Louisville", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/2014/12/14/go-santa-go-run-benefits-gildas-club-louisville/20404363/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Runners don beards, hats for 5K in Iroquois Park", "title": "Go Santa Go run benefits Gilda's Club Louisville", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d324205b27385800efa347ff5e5b02cf2f366af1/c=334-0-1667-1333&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/12/14/B9315469080Z.1_20141214165033_000_G6M9DD2KS.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Ovarian cancer", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Ovarian cancer", "title": "Go Santa Go run benefits Gilda's Club Louisville", "author": "Amber Sigman", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ac20add3f92adfd1d6e695591937e6e42c30dd09/c=500-0-1500-1333/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/12/14/B9315469080Z.1_20141214165033_000_G6M9DD2KS.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/46837b90ae998993d99356e31057d6d0ad0c3903/c=334-0-1667-1333/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/12/14/B9315469080Z.1_20141214165033_000_G6M9DD2KS.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/65cf2a46e294251efac8980d44d4354bd635d5ce/c=112-0-1889-1333/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/12/14/B9315469080Z.1_20141214165033_000_G6M9DD2KS.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6ad857ff3f471a9f423b391a57ab1297845aebf6/c=0-104-2000-1229&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/12/14/B9315469080Z.1_20141214165033_000_G6M9DD2KS.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-12-14T17:02:16.677000-05:00", "shorthed": "Go Santa Go run benefits Gilda's Club Louisville", "articleid": 20404363, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d93021e91b0ec7a084ab7d527e0eff44827b6fb/c=0-104-2000-1229/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/12/14/B9315469080Z.1_20141214165033_000_G6M9DD2KS.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f8e536322b64e5e9bd07b1b166217d069e2b028e/c=625-0-1375-1333/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/12/14/B9315469080Z.1_20141214165033_000_G6M9DD2KS.1-0.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "go santa go, santa, run, iroquois park, louisville, gilda's club"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb4a6\"", "article_summary": "Buy Photo Go Santa Go participants wait to begin the 5k at Iroquois Park to benefit Gilda's Club Louisville.\n\"They are more than cancer; cancer doesn't define our members,\" said Chelsea Raff, Major Gifts Officer with Gilda's Club Louisville.\nGilda's Club offers free cancer support for anyone living with cancer, including their loved ones.\nGilda's Club Louisville offers support groups, yoga, pilates, social events, art classes, educational lectures and other events.\nShe offers free magnets and pamphlets to guests after their run with inspirational quotes, such as, \"Laughter is good medicine without side effects.\""}
