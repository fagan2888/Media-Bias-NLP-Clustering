In the real world, Christianity is dynamic and growing. Estimates are that there will be around 3 billion Christians on this planet by 2050.\n\nAnother Christian bashing fantasy is that Christianity in general and the Catholic Church in particular are not \u201crelevant\u201d to the modern world. This is another example of Christian bashers deliberately ignoring not only reality, but their own behavior.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the Christian bashers themselves. Who do they attack? Is it Muslims? Pagans? Satanists?\n\nNope.\n\nThey go after Christians and Christianity and they love to hate on the Catholic Church. Day and night, night and day, they rant and rave like a bunch of torch-carrying Nazis at a rally about the supposed horrors of Christianity and the Catholic Church. They make searching for embarrassing things that individual Christians or Catholics do, and then implying that this is the behavior of all 2 billion Christians, their bigoted business day and night.\n\nThey will go to just about any lengths to drive Catholics off discussion boards and use those boards for their own purposes. They flatter and cajole the weak-as-branch-water Christians who simp when they are stroked. Then they try to use these silly people as weapons against other Christians. It appears that they get up every morning and flick on their computers to begin their daily mission of hate, bigotry and cultivation of prejudice.\n\nIf Christianity isn\u2019t relevant to these people, they\u2019re behavior makes even less sense than it does now. I would posit that Christianity, in particular Catholicism, is the most relevant fact of their lives. Without hatred of Christians and the Catholic Church, they would no longer have any reason to write their gutter blogs. Without hatred of Christians and the Catholic Church, how would they feel special?\n\nThese people are more focused on the Catholic Church than Pope Francis. In fact, they are a lot more focused on the Catholic Church than Pope Francis, since Pope Francis is actually focused on Jesus Christ.\n\nRelevant? These folks who claim that the Catholic Church is not relevant deny their claims by how they live their lives. They are obsessed, and not in a good sense, with the Catholic Church. It may be the only relevance in their sick little lives.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at government leaders here in America. If the Catholic Church is irrelevant to President Obama, why did he tarnish the legacy of his own presidency by attacking the First Amendment as a means of attacking the Church? All he had to do was keep his word and live up to the promises he made to the American people and Congress when he was lobbying to pass the Affordable Health Care Act.\n\nBut no. He compromised his own place in history by going off on a battle to limit the First Amendment to activities inside church sanctuaries. He went after the basic freedoms of all Americans in order to attack one specific group of Americans: The Catholic Church.\n\nWhy? I\u2019m not going to venture into the subterranean channels of President Obama\u2019s mind. I have no idea what lies there. Besides, it doesn\u2019t matter. All that matters with any public official is what they do with the power we give them. Why they do what they do is their problem.\n\nThe point for the purpose of this post is simply that the Catholic Church is way past \u201crelevant\u201d to President Obama. This meretricious war he\u2019s engaged in against the First Amendment is the behavior of man who is willing to bet everything on an attempt to force the Catholic Church to bend its knee and kiss Caesar\u2019s ring.\n\nThere appear to be few things more \u201crelevant\u201d to president Obama than the Catholic Church.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the Catholic bashers of the right and left sides of the political spectrum. I lump them together because, after long years in public office in which I have been thoroughly and repeatedly attacked by both sides, I see no difference between them. Right and left wing nuts are the same.\n\nThe reason that both right and left wing nuts attack the Catholic Church is the reason that they do everything: Power. Far from being \u201cirrelevant,\u201d the Catholic Church is a powerhouse of political persuasion. Literally millions of people will place their loyalty to the Catholic Church above loyalty to the R and the D.\n\nWitness the 2014 elections. For the first time, a majority of Catholics voted R. Why? I think the answer to that is obvious. President Obama and his attacks on their Church made the decision for them. Their loyalty was to their Church, not their party.\n\nThat, my friends, is power. The power to inspire people to change their long-held behavior, simply out of loyalty, is political power with a capitol P.\n\nThe problem for the Rs is that the Catholic Church does not trim the Gospels down to a couple of issues and ignore or even attack all the rest of what Jesus taught. Contrary to what President Obama implied, the Catholic Church expects a lot more of government officials than that they just vote against abortion and gay marriage.\n\nRank and file wing nuts of both political persuasions, which is to say people like you and me, are just a blinded file of nameless nothings to the people who run the two political parties. They are numbers on a sheet. They were recruited by careful use of \u201cwedge issues,\u201d push polls and profiling. It\u2019s a numbers game.\n\nIn the rooms where the decisions are made, which is to say in the rooms of the money men who control the parties, no one is committed to pro life, pro choice, or gay marriage. They want control of government monies and lawmaking powers. They may have opinions about those issues, but their first concern is simply how the issues help them take control of the government. Their real goals are government pork barrel, using government to destroy their competitors, both domestic and foreign, and enacting policies that will allow them to seize public monies and use government power for their own ends.\n\nThe Catholic Church is a troublesome factor in this real life game of thrones, simply because it will not be controlled by these power brokers. While a good many denominations have abandoned the Gospels to deify either the right or the left, the Catholic Church keeps on following the whole Gospels of Christ.\n\nAn entity that inspires such loyalty of so many people, that will not fall into the carefully hewn lines of right and left political manipulation, is not just relevant in today\u2019s political world; it is the last serious challenge to the hegemony of the power brokers behind the R and the D.\n\nThat\u2019s why the right and left power brokers send their minions to attack the Church. They hate and fear the Church because it is the last challenger facing them.\n\nContrary to the bizarre little tropes created by Catholic bashers, the Catholic Church is relevant to today\u2019s world in a way that no other entity is relevant. The reason it is being attacked from all sides is because the Catholic Church is that sign of contradiction to the world of darkness that every Christian should be.\n\nMy purpose in writing Public Catholic is to encourage, empower and equip individual Christians to become signs of contradiction themselves. I do not care if you are an R or a D. I am not trying to get you to change parties. I\u2019m not interested in telling you how to vote.\n\nI want you to fall in love with Jesus. I want you to commit yourself to Him. I want you to become a change agent for Christ, wherever you are.\n\nThis world needs conversion, and you and I are the ones God has placed here in this time and place to do the converting. But we cannot do that if we are so enthralled with the R and the D that we trim our faith to fit their machinations.\n\nThe Catholic Church shows us the Way that leads to eternal life. There is nothing more relevant than that.\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches us how to apply the Gospels of Christ to our daily lives, our culture and our world. There is nothing more relevant than that.\n\nThe Catholic Church is hated, feared, bashed and attacked by purveyors of nihilism, death and corporatism everywhere. That is because they know but lie to avoid admitting that the Catholic Church is absolutely, completely and everlastingly relevant to this dying world.\n\nThe Catholic Church is as relevant as Jesus Christ, and He is the only relevance there is.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Public Catholic", "description": "Catholic in the Public Square", "title": "Surprise!
