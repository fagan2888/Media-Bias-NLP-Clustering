Hillary rarely directly spoke of her competitor in the June 7 California Democratic primary, Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014 preferring to keep her rhetoric focused on Trump by implying a need to unite against him. \u201cWhen I think about what\u2019s at stake ... even if I weren\u2019t running for president, I would be doing everything I could to make sure the presumptive nominee in the Republican Party never gets near the White House,\u201d Hillary said. Hillary spent some of her speech highlighting the work of some local politicians, such as U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, who accompanied Hillary to the stage at about 4:15 p.m. Boxer, who was hosting a private fundraiser for Hillary with U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein later in the day, said Oakland was full of support for Hillary. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to search hard to see any votes for what\u2019s his name ... he\u2019ll wish he was back in Trump Tower,\u201d Boxer said. In speaking of Boxer later, Hillary said she\u2019d be \u201cbe calling her a lot\u201d for her expertise if she were to be elected president. Hillary also mentioned Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who had made a speech shortly before Hillary took the stage. Schaaf, like Boxer, shied away from attacking Sanders in her speech but did say the country needed \u201cnot just a leader that has great and beautiful ideas but has the grit ... and the know-how to get them done.\u201d The only time Hillary brought up Sanders, whose supporters gathered in small numbers outside the venue and chanted the senator\u2019s name to those exiting after the event concluded, was to attack his goal for eliminating higher education costs after touting her plan. \u201cMy esteemed opponent has a plan for what he says will be free (college),\u201d Hillary said. \u201cIf you read the fine print ... it\u2019s free for everyone, even billionaires.\u201d She also claimed that she was the \u201conly candidate on either side who (promised to) not raise middle class taxes, period.\u201d She mentioned that the next president should \u201cfollow the example of California\u201d and raise the federal minimum wage, though she did not specify whether it should match the state\u2019s minimum wage of $15, effective 2023, as Sanders has argued. On a variety of issues, Hillary tied her own vision for the presidency to that of President Barack Obama. \u201cWe have to finish the work the president started on the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Hillary said to a resounding cheer, before the jeers came when she added, \u201cTrump says he\u2019s going repeal it.\u201d \u201cAnd they can\u2019t tell you what they\u2019d replace it with because it\u2019s something you wouldn\u2019t like to hear,\u201d she added. She said she was proud of Obama\u2019s economic record, but admitted, \u201cwe have to go further.\u201d She mentioned high-paying jobs, investments in infrastructure and women\u2019s issues as areas that need improvement. And she took every opportunity to contrast her own vision with that of Trump\u2019s. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t think much of equal pay for women, because of course he doesn\u2019t think much of women,\u201d she said. Stressing disparities in foreign policy ideas between her and Trump, Hillary said the country was facing a \u201cmake-or-break election\u201d in choosing the next commander in chief. \u201cSome of what I\u2019m hearing from Trump is quite concerning,\u201d she said, referencing discussions about allowing countries have nuclear weapons. \u201cHe talks about it as if it\u2019s some real estate deal.\u201d She winded down her speech with a series of vows that were met with roaring applause, such as battling money in politics and the gun lobby. After leaving the venue, Hillary was scheduled to attend two sold-out fundraisers in San Francisco before continuing on the campaign trail.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "Hillary Clinton speaks in Oakland -", "title": "Hillary Clinton speaks in Oakland - San Mateo Daily Journal", "url": "http://www.smdailyjournal.com/articles/lnews/2016-05-07/hillary-clinton-speaks-in-oakland/1776425162971.html", "image": "http://www.smdailyjournal.com/adv_image/smdj-large.jpg", "ttl": 2592000, "type": "website"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000103315106, "app_id": 484828421538257}, "GENERATOR": "San Mateo Daily Journal"}, "article_summary": "Hillary also mentioned Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who had made a speech shortly before Hillary took the stage.\nStressing disparities in foreign policy ideas between her and Trump, Hillary said the country was facing a \u201cmake-or-break election\u201d in choosing the next commander in chief.\nHillary spent some of her speech highlighting the work of some local politicians, such as U.S. Sen.
