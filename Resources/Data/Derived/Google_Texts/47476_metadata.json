During the fight he pulled out his firearm and used racial slurs. Hillman reportedly admitted to the facts of the altercation to the Riverside County Sheriff\u2019s Department but wasn\u2019t charged with a crime. He then reportedly denied involvement in the fight to internal investigators of the LAPD and was recommended to be fired for lack of integrity.\n\nBut Beck sees it differently, claiming that eight different (internal) charges were brought up against Hillman but only three were sustained. Otherwise, Beck says, he would\u2019ve fired Hillman before he was sent before the board. Beck insisted he couldn\u2019t make his decision driven by public opinion, nor \"just because of a person\u2019s position, or just because of who they\u2019re related to, or any other reason.\" CBS Los Angeles explains:\n\nOfficer Hillman\u2019s father was an LAPD officer, while his uncle, Michael Hillman, was a popular and well-known deputy chief, who ascended through the ranks alongside Chief Beck.\n\n\n\nBeck, however, insists that favoritism had played no part in his decision on the matter.\n\n\n\n\"Favoritism had nothing to do with my decision on this,\" Chief Beck said. \"I made decisions on this based on the facts, I can\u2019t discuss what those particulars are. You all know that. That\u2019s state law\u2026 .\"\n\nBeck said there was a \"consistent standard\" that he\u2019s set that was met in this case. But don\u2019t expect it to be the same standard you\u2019d meet if you got into a drunken fight and pulled a firearm, especially in California.\n\nh/t Grand Moff Serious Man", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Charlie Beck, the chief of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), overturned the decision of a disciplinary board to fire Officer Shaun Hillman, who", "title": "LAPD Chief Denies Favoritism in Reversing Firing of Problem Cop Who Came From a Family of Cops", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/04/02/lapd-chief-denies-favoritism-in-reversin", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/13964712931702.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Charlie Beck, the chief of the Los Angeles\nPolice Department (LAPD), overturned the decision of a disciplinary\nboard to fire Officer Shaun Hillman, who was involved in a drunken\nfight at a bar.
