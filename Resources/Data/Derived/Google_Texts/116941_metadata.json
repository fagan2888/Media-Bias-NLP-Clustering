Since the law has such complex rules regulating the subsidies, the groups said it will be hard for the government to recoup overpayments \u2013 leading to hundreds of billions in lost tax dollars.\n\nRelated: Problems Found with 2 Million Obamacare Signups\n\nUnder the law, consumers who receive subsidies that are too high are required to pay them back to the government. This situation might occur if, for instance, a consumer qualifies for a subsidy and then receives a pay raise. That individual\u2019s income would then be higher than originally estimated for the 2014 application process \u2013 so when filing their 2014 taxes, the consumer would have to repay a portion of the subsidy.\n\nThe problem, according to Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now head of the American Action Forum, a center-right policy institute, is the complex rules surrounding the reconciliation process that could make enforcement more difficult, he said. Those who earn below 200 percent of the federal poverty line (FPL), for example, would not be required to pay back more than $300. Individuals between 200 and 300 percent of the FPL would only have to pay up to $700.\n\nMeanwhile, those making between 300 and 400 percent of the poverty line are capped at paying a $1,250 limit, and those making four times the poverty level would have to repay the entire subsidy.\n\n\u201cThe system [is] essentially unworkable,\u201d said Holtz-Eakin in testimony on Tuesday. He likened the complexities of the subsidies to the Earned Income Tax Credit. \u201cThe ACA premium credits are novel, which when paired with a complex design will likely precipitate erroneous payments. The combination of these elements and lax enforcement standards risks error rates on the order of those observed in the EITC program\u2026 These erroneous payments will result in enormous budgetary costs.\u201d\n\nRelated: Big Increases in Obamacare Premiums and Deductibles Coming in November\n\nDemocrats on the committee accused Republicans of trotting out witnesses to \u201cfake outrage\u201d over the subsidy enforcement, using it as their latest campaign strategy ahead of the 2014 midterms.\n\n\u201cIt sounds to me as though the testimony of some of the ... witnesses is fear-mongering to make people afraid,\u201d said Rep. Jim McDermott (D-WA).\n\nStill, others have expressed concerns about the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s implementation and enforcement of the law. Earlier this year, the inspector general for the taxing agency warned the IRS may be too overburdened to efficiently enforce the individual mandate, as well as the handful of other new provisions under the law.\n\n\u201cI am deeply concerned about the ability of the IRS to continue to fulfill its mission if the agency lacks adequate funding. Our current level of funding is clearly less than what the agency needs, especially to provide the level of taxpayer services the public has a right to expect,\u201d IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told Congress.\n\nRelated: HHS Chief Burwell Confirmed with Strong GOP Support\n\nThe warning from conservative groups comes about a week after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency overseeing the health care law, revealed that there was a wide range of income inconsistencies on roughly 1.2 million insurance exchange applications.\n\nRepublicans have called on the administration to stop offering subsidies until \u201cit is able and willing to verify income information and ensure it is not making erroneous payments,\u201d GOP lawmakers on the House Ways and Means Committee wrote in a letter to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.\n\nMeanwhile, Obamacare advocates say the discrepancies aren\u2019t as big of a deal as Republicans are making them.\n\nRon Pollack, executive director of Families USA, said the application inconsistencies were \u201cworth examining\u201d but described the concerns as \u201cmuch ado about very little.\u201d\n\nHHS officials have said they\u2019re already working to fix discrepancies and will continue to do so over the next few months. HHS has created and implemented a system to automatically \u201cturn off\u201d benefits for those enrollees who are found to be ineligible.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The battle against Obamacare is still ongoing \u2013 and now some conservatives are focusin", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The battle against Obamacare is still ongoing \u2013 and now some conservatives are focusin", "title": "Obamacare Subsidy Overpayments: How to Recoup?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/11/Obamacare-Subsidy-Overpayments-How-Recoup", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09112012_Health_Cash_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/11/Obamacare-Subsidy-Overpayments-How-Recoup", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09112012_Health_Cash_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "keywords": "Obamacare, Republicans, subsidies", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3446\"", "article_summary": "The battle against Obamacare is still ongoing \u2013 and now some conservatives are focusing on the law\u2019s subsidies for low-income people.\nThis situation might occur if, for instance, a consumer qualifies for a subsidy and then receives a pay raise.\nRelated: Problems Found with 2 Million Obamacare SignupsUnder the law, consumers who receive subsidies that are too high are required to pay them back to the government.\nSince the law has such complex rules regulating the subsidies, the groups said it will be hard for the government to recoup overpayments \u2013 leading to hundreds of billions in lost tax dollars.\nMeanwhile, Obamacare advocates say the discrepancies aren\u2019t as big of a deal as Republicans are making them."}
