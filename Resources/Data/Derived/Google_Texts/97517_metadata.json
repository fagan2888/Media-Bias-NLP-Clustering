Budig\n\nECM Capitol Reporter\n\nThe state\u2019s new health insurance exchange is expected to begin enrolling Minnesotans into insurance programs as scheduled, despite a recent security breach.\n\n\u201cWe are planning to go live on October 1st,\u201d MNsure Executive Director April Todd-Malmlov told a legislative committee on Tuesday, Sept. 24. Sen. Michelle Benson, R-Ham Lake, is alarmed by unfinished training at MNsure, saying the health insurance marketplace isn\u2019t ready to start enrollment. (Photo by T.W. Budig)\n\nBut Sen. Michelle Benson, R-Ham Lake, in part citing unfinished training, argued that MNsure \u2013 which is expected to assist some 1.3 million Minnesotans in finding health insurance \u2013 wasn\u2019t ready for \u201cprime time.\u201d Republicans will continue to demand accountability, she said in a statement.\n\nSo will others. Legislative Auditor Jim Nobles told a legislative oversight committee that, in two to three weeks, his office will release information on its investigation into a Sept. 12 incident. A former MNsure employee mistakenly sent an insurance broker an unencrypted email that included a spreadsheet, not password protected, containing private data on 1,587 individual brokers. The federal government, Todd-Malmlov said, has approved the use of federal dollars to cover the cost of credit-monitoring services to affected brokers who want it.\n\nCommittee co-chair Sen. Tony Lourey, DFL-Kerrick, described the security breach as a big concern. But, he noted, only 28 minutes elapsed from when the email was sent until the discovery of the error.\n\nFor the 900,000 Minnesotans on medical assistance or enrolled in MinnesotaCare, the security offered by MNsure is better than that found in counties relying on paperwork, Lourey said.\n\nChris Buse, the state\u2019s chief information security officer, spoke of using an independent consultant and taking other precautions in designing security for the MNsure computer system.

Budig)\n\nBuse described the security as \u201ctotally state of the art,\u201d the best model in state government.\n\n\u201c(But) security is never really done,\u201d he said.\n\nMNsure organizers know there is anxiety in the public, Todd-Malmlov said. She noted that MNsure navigators \u2014 people who assistance clients in selecting health coverage plan \u2014 undergo background checks.\n\nAlthough some 5,000 brokers and other officials will have access to the MNsure system, access levels are restricted, Todd-Malmlov explained, and visits are logged.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t expect a rush of enrollment on Oct. 1. Instead, she expects the initial wave of visitors to include lots of \u201clookers,\u201d people more interested in inspecting the MNsure system than buying insurance.\n\nIndividuals not covered under an employer\u2019s health care plan and small businesses with up to 50 employees can shop MNsure. Larger employers may be able to use MNsure in the future, according to MNsure.\n\nUnder the Federal Affordable Care Act, nicknamed Obamacare, most Americans will be required to have health insurance.\n\nStarting next year, the penalty for not having coverage will be $95 per adult or 1 percent of taxable income, whichever is greater. By 2016, the cost of going without coverage will be $695 per adult or 2.5 percent of taxable income, whichever is greater.\n\nNot everyone faces penalties for not buying an insurance plan. People living in poverty, those without coverage for less than three months, American Indians and those with religious objections are exempted.\n\nCiting the findings of a Massachusetts Institute of Technical health economist, the Minnesota Department of Commerce notes that due to federal tax credits, more than half of those in the individual health care market in MNsure should have access to premiums that will be the same or lower than their 2013 premiums. Many MNsure consumers could see their premiums drop by more than 30 percent, the department notes.\n\nUnder Obamacare, starting in 2014, insurance companies cannot turn people away because of pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nIndividuals can buy health insurance outside of MNsure, but tax credits may not apply, according to MNsure.\n\nA palate of coverage levels is available. Bronze-level plans will cover about 60 percent of services offered; silver, about 70 percent, with gold plans covering about 80 percent of services provided. Platinum plans will cover about 90 percent of the cost of services provide.\n\nA Spartan \u201ccatastrophic\u201d health care plan will be available for low-income Minnesotans at low cost.\n\nState officials have hailed the insurance rates found through MNsure as the lowest in the country.\n\n\u201cThe costs Minnesotans will pay for their health insurance are markedly lower than in most other states,\u201d Gov. Mark Dayton said in a statement.\n\nCredit is due for the efforts of the public and private sector in controlling rising health care costs, the governor said.\n\n\u201cThose efforts must, and will, continue,\u201d Dayton said.\n\nMNsure insurance coverage begins Jan. 1.\n\nTim Budig can be reached at [email protected].", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "ABC Newspapers", "description": "The state\u2019s new health insurance exchange is expected to begin enrolling Minnesotans into insurance programs as scheduled, despite a recent security breach.", "title": "Despite challenges, objections, MNsure set to open Oct. 1", "url": "http://ecmpublishers.com/2013/09/26/despite-challenges-objections-mnsure-set-open-oct-1/", "image": "http://abcnewspapers.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2013/09/MNsure-Buse-MnIT-300x198.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 117651516683}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width, height=device-height, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfced\"", "article_summary": "MNsure insurance coverage begins Jan. 1.\nIndividuals can buy health insurance outside of MNsure, but tax credits may not apply, according to MNsure.\nCredit is due for the efforts of the public and private sector in controlling rising health care costs, the governor said.\nSen.
