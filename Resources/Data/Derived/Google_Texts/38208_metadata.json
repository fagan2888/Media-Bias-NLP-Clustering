Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) is under criminal investigation by the Portsmouth Police Department for allegedly assaulting a campaign volunteer for former Sen. Scott Brown, Sergeant Chris Kiberd confirmed to Breitbart News via telephone on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI have nothing else I can give you on it at this point because that information broke last night during his shift [Sgt. Dave Keaveny\u2019s] and it\u2019s only been a few hours,\u201d Kiberd said when reached by phone on Saturday. \u201cThe detective who\u2019s handling that is not in right now. But he\u2019s assigned to the case and he\u2019s going to be following up on that.\u201d\n\nKeaveny, the sergeant on duty on Friday night, told the Portsmouth Herald that former Democratic Sen. Burt Cohen is under investigation by the Portsmouth Police Department for allegedly assaulting a Brown campaign volunteer, shouting obscenities at the Brown campaign bus, and attempting to force his way onto the bus after being asked to leave.\n\n\u201cOur portion is still under investigation at this point,\u201d Keaveny told the local paper. \u201cWe got a call because there was a disturbance by the bus. We responded but are still trying to sort out what happened.\u201d\n\nKiberd confirmed to Breitbart News that Cohen is \u201cunder investigation\u201d and that local Detective Robert Munson has been assigned to investigate the matter. \u201cThis will hopefully be resolved by tomorrow,\u201d Kiberd said. It\u2019s unclear at this time what resolution may come and whether charges will be filed against Cohen.\n\nAccording to Brown campaign adviser Ryan Williams, after the campaign bus dropped Brown, his wife Gail Huff, daughter Ayla Brown, and many other campaign staff off in downtown Portsmouth for a Halloween festival, the bus took Brown\u2019s sister and niece to the local high school for the annual Halloween football game. When the bus got there, Brown\u2019s niece\u2013a student at Portsmouth High School\u2013invited some of her friends onto the bus to check it out before they headed to the game. But their plans went horribly awry when Shaheen\u2019s campaign ally Cohen allegedly began \u201cscreaming obscenities\u201d at the bus, according to Williams.\n\nCohen\u2019s behavior prompted the Brown campaign volunteer aboard the bus to come out and ask him to stop and leave, Williams said. At that point, Williams claimed things got physical.\n\nWilliams alleged that Cohen \u201claid his hands on\u201d the campaign staffer who was on the bus with Brown\u2019s sister and niece. Williams claimed Cohen attempted to board the bus without permission and \u201cphysically assaulted\u201d the Brown campaign volunteer while trying to get on board.\n\nThe Brown campaign volunteer called the police. Cohen left the area of the bus at that point but came back to the bus and began knocking on its window, video shows. The video was captured by either Brown\u2019s niece or one of her friends and was provided to the police officials investigating, to the Portsmouth Herald, and to Breitbart News.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s\u2013he\u2019s right there,\u201d says a young woman, either Brown\u2019s niece or one of her friends, at the beginning of the video. The video is being shot by a cell phone looking out the side window of the bus, and shows Cohen approaching the side of the bus.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming back\u2013he\u2019s coming back after him!\u201d a second woman, Brown\u2019s sister, says next. \u201cUnbelievable. What is wrong with this\u2013?\u201d\n\nWilliams told Breitbart News that the first part of the altercation was not caught on video, and the only video that\u2019s available is the second part.\n\nOfficers set out on a manhunt to find Cohen, who had disappeared amid the football game at that point. Cohen said in an interview with the Portsmouth Herald via phone that he spoke with police and doesn\u2019t expect charges to be filed\u2013even though both Sergeants Kiberd and Keaveny confirm he\u2019s under investigation.\n\nCohen denied the first part of the incident\u2013where he allegedly assaulted the Brown volunteer and attempted to storm his way onto the bus\u2013in the interview with the local paper, but did admit to the second part of the incident where he approached the bus as seen in the video.\n\n\u201cReached by phone, Cohen admitted he approached the bus, to ask how long they intended to idle the bus. He absolutely denies trying to force his way on the bus or touching any member of the Brown campaign,\u201d the Portsmouth Herald\u2018s Karen Dandurant wrote.\n\nCohen said he was upset the bus was running while it wasn\u2019t being driven\u2013and was afraid the idling would hurt the environment.\n\n\u201cI told them it is pollution,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI care about things like that.\u201d\n\nCohen said that when the Brown campaign asked him to leave the area\u2013something he says was them getting \u201cnasty\u201d with him\u2013that \u201cunfortunately I got nasty in turn.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did swear and I regret that,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI think things got caught up in the heat of the campaign. That does happen.\u201d\n\nHe apologized at least one more time to the local newspaper. \u201cI am really upset and regretful,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThis should not have ended this way.\u201d\n\nBrown, his wife Gail, daughter Ayla, GOP gubernatorial candidate Walt Havenstein, Havenstein\u2019s wife, and several Brown and Havenstein staffers had been passing out candy to children at the Halloween festival downtown Portsmouth when Brown got the news of what happened on the bus. Downtown Portsmouth is closed off for several blocks every Halloween for a parade, where the local school marching bands march down the street and adults and children alike all dress up in Halloween costumes with them.\n\nBrown mingled with the thousands of people in the blue collar town, trying to convince them to vote for him. One man, a military veteran, asked Brown to convince him to vote for him, saying he had reservations\u2013but after about two minutes, Brown won him over. Others told him they\u2019re normally Democrats but they\u2019re voting for him, and Brown could barely get through the throngs lining up to take pictures with him. Some were a bit surprised at first to see him, and wondered if it was really Scott Brown joining them for the Halloween parade.\n\nBased on the sheer number of people who came up to him throughout the night telling him they\u2019re voting for him, he\u2019s going to get at least a few thousand votes from Portsmouth. By comparison, the town was one of the strongest areas for Democrat Paul Hodes in 2010\u2019s election where Kelly Ayotte beat Hodes by double digits statewide. Hodes got about 4,000 votes from Portsmouth\u2019s five wards in 2010, but Ayotte only got about 3,000. Brown\u2019s everyman, grassroots appeal seems to work in these blue collar towns.\n\nWhen Brown got the call about what happened on the campaign bus, however, he was visibly irate. \u201cThey can come after me all they want, but to go after my family?\u201d he said to this reporter. \u201cThat\u2019s unacceptable. What did they do to deserve this?\u201d\n\nBrown talked on his cell phone, presumably to his sister and the others on site, getting all the details about exactly what happened and ensuring that everyone was safe and that Cohen did not hurt anybody.\n\nWilliams, Brown\u2019s campaign adviser, called on Sen. Shaheen to denounce Cohen\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on Jeanne Shaheen to denounce this behavior, and to return any campaign contributions from Burt Cohen,\u201d said Williams. \u201cThis man terrorized Scott\u2019s sister, his niece and her friends. He physically assaulted one of our volunteers. We locked the bus and he was going around it, banging on it.\u201d\n\nCohen is a campaign ally and donor to Shaheen\u2019s re-election campaign. He was at a Shaheen campaign event in Portsmouth on Wednesday, Oct. 15, at which he helped her receive the endorsement of the liberal group the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.\n\n\u201cImagine if we had privatized Social Security back in the early part of the last decade when Congress was looking at that. During the financial meltdown, people lost $2 trillion in their retirement,\u201d Shaheen said at the event, according to the Foster\u2019s Daily Democrat newspaper. \u201cImagine if Social Security had been part of that.\u201d\n\nThe Foster\u2019s reporter there, Kimberley Haas, wrote that point from Shaheen \u201chit home for Burt Cohen, who served in the New Hampshire State Senate from 1990 to 2004, and was at the event.\u201d\n\n\u201cSocial Security is highly important,\u201d Cohen said at the event, which he spoke at. \u201cWall Street would love to have control of that much money.\u201d\n\n\u201cCohen said Republicans spread misinformation about Social Security because they want to tax and destroy the program,\u201d Haas wrote, adding: \u201cShaheen agreed with Cohen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some people, and I am not one of them, that want to support Wall Street,\u201d Shaheen said.\n\nAccording to Federal Election Commission (FEC) records, Shaheen has also accepted $750 from Cohen over the course of two donations in 2013 and 2014.\n\nShaheen\u2019s spokesmen Harrell Kirstein and Shripal Shah have not responded to multiple requests for comment on whether the Senator will denounce this behavior or return the donations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Police: Shaheen Campaign Ally Under Investigation for Allegedly Assaulting Brown Volunteer", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Police: Shaheen Campaign Ally Under Investigation for Allegedly Assaulting Brown Volunteer", "title": "Police: Shaheen Campaign Ally Under Investigation for Allegedly Assaulting Brown Volunteer - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/2014-Candidates/scott-brown-jeanne-shaheen-final-debate-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/11/01/police-shaheen-campaign-ally-under-criminal-investigation-for-allegedly-assaulting-brown-volunteer/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Police: Shaheen Campaign Ally Under Investigation for Allegedly Assaulting Brown Volunteer", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/2014-Candidates/scott-brown-jeanne-shaheen-final-debate-ap.jpg", "title": "Police: Shaheen Campaign Ally Under Investigation for Allegedly Assaulting Brown Volunteer - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Jeanne Shaheen, Kelly Ayotte, Senate,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Senate", "published_time": "2014-11-01T12:31:04-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc40f\"", "article_summary": "The Brown campaign volunteer called the police.\nCohen\u2019s behavior prompted the Brown campaign volunteer aboard the bus to come out and ask him to stop and leave, Williams said.\nWilliams claimed Cohen attempted to board the bus without permission and \u201cphysically assaulted\u201d the Brown campaign volunteer while trying to get on board.\nWhen Brown got the call about what happened on the campaign bus, however, he was visibly irate.\nBut their plans went horribly awry when Shaheen\u2019s campaign ally Cohen allegedly began \u201cscreaming obscenities\u201d at the bus, according to Williams."}
