The subject of the fake questions this time? President Bill Clinton, Kimmel\u2019s guest for the evening.\n\nThe pedestrians were asked questions about things Clinton didn\u2019t actually do, like ending the Korean War \u2014 a war that actually ended when Clinton was just a kid. The responses from the pedestrians were frightening and highlight the fact that some Americans have no clue about what\u2019s going on in the country.\n\nWill Clinton\u2019s role as a judge on America\u2019s Got Talent next year damage his legacy?\n\n\u201cNo, because I think that it will make him even more popular,\u201d the woman being interviewed said.\n\nIt\u2019s probably true that a Clinton cameo on America\u2019s Got Talent wouldn\u2019t hurt, since the show is about to begin its ninth season in May. The problem? He\u2019s not going to be on the show.\n\nTwo women apparently believed, without question, that the 42nd President had been called back into active duty as Commander-in-Chief due to President Barack Obama getting knee surgery.\n\nClinton even received some advice about his appearance from two men dressed up in costumes \u2014 get rid of the ponytail! (The former President doesn\u2019t actually have a ponytail, of course.)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Once again, the people of Hollywood Boulevard didn't disappoint when Jimmy Kimmel's Lie Witness News crew took to the sidewalks on Wednesday.
