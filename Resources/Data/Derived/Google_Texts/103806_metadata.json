PAUL, minn. \u2014\n\nIn Quebec City, Alex Tanguay lined up for a faceoff against Joe Sakic.\n\nSakic put the puck between Tanguay\u2019s legs, went around him and scored on Nordiques goalie Ron Hextall.\n\nBoth were younger then, of course.\n\nSakic was 22 and Tanguay was 12, on the ice at the Colisee for a practice promotion held in conjunction with the annual and world-famous Quebec peewee tournament. Hextall played in goal for the kids, while the goalie for Tanguay\u2019s team was in the net for the Nordiques.\n\nSakic winces at the story, but Tanguay enjoys telling it. And the full-circle twists keep coming. They played together on a Stanley Cup championship team in 2001 and now, in his second tour of duty with the Avalanche, Tanguay is playing for Sakic, the Avalanche\u2019s general manager, while another former teammate, Patrick Roy, is his coach.\n\nTanguay is the \u201cbridge\u201d between Avalanche eras.\n\nHe will be one of five current Avalanche players among the 20 selections for the Avs\u2019 20th anniversary team honored Monday at the Colorado-Minnesota game at the Pepsi Center. The other four named to the team after team-conducted fan voting: Erik Johnson, Matt Duchene, Gabe Landeskog and Semyon Varlamov. Sakic and Roy will join them.\n\n(The Denver Post\u2019s earlier choices in October \u2014 a list finalized after give-and-take and horse trading between Mike Chambers and me \u2014 were the same in 19 of the 20 cases. Ryan O\u2019Reilly was on our list; the team-announced choices included Johnson instead.)\n\n\u201cThis team has a 20-year history and tradition now, and being a part of those \u2018good\u2019 years, I think the fans remember those years and the excitement with those teams we had,\u201d Tanguay said during the Avalanche\u2019s week-long road trip. \u201cI\u2019m just fortunate I came in at the right time and be a part of it.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m very honored that the fans think of me as one of the 20 guys. You look at that lineup, and it\u2019s a pretty good lineup. I\u2019m happy and I can\u2019t wait to see some of the guys on Monday. I haven\u2019t seen some of them for a long time, so it will be really nice.\u201d\n\nDuchene, 24, was an Avalanche fan growing up \u2014 revering Sakic, Roy and Peter Forsberg \u2014 in Ontario and just missed playing with Sakic. When Sakic announced his retirement in 2009, Duchene was attending the Avalanche\u2019s rookie orientation camp and even was at the news conference.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big honor and it\u2019s going to be special to be among some of my heroes, and some of my teammates as well,\u201d Duchene said. \u201cIt should be fun. \u2026 I still really looked up to those three guys as a kid and it\u2019s always fun being around those guys and being part of this franchise.\u201d\n\nSaid the Minnesota-raised Johnson: \u201cWhen I was a kid, I idolized a lot of the guys that are on the 20th team. I have a Sakic jersey I had when I was a little kid. It\u2019s special when the fans vote you in as one of the best 20 guys of all time and it will be a fun night for sure.\u201d\n\nAt last count, the only selections who definitely won\u2019t be in Denver on Monday are Chris Drury plus the still-active John-Michael Liles (Carolina) and Paul Stastny (St. Louis). Claude Lemieux hopes to make it, but is a maybe at this point.\n\nFor Roy, there is a bit of a reunion factor.\n\n\u201cWhen you win the Stanley Cup and you are part of a group like this, it\u2019s always special to see the guys again,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand this is not for the Stanley Cup, it\u2019s for the 20th anniversary all-star team, but it\u2019s nice to see the guys you won with.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@ denverpost.com or @TFrei\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nThe Patrick Roy trade\n\nWhen: Sunday is the 20th anniversary of the controversial trade that brought Roy to the Avalanche from the Montreal Canadiens.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: The timing might be coincidence, but the anniversary of the trade closely coincides with the Avalanche\u2019s salute to its 20th anniversary team Monday night \u2014 a team that, of course, includes Roy.\n\nBackground: The lead-up to the famous trade has been well documented, most recently in an extensive All Things Avs blog last week. A few additional details have come out since December 1995, including that an earlier deal involving Roy coming to the Avalanche for Owen Nolen fell through when Canadiens general manager Serge Savard was fired in October. Nolen soon was traded to San Jose for Sandis Ozolinsh.\n\nFrei\u2019s take: I spoke with Roy again about all of this in New York during the Avalanche\u2019s road trip that wrapped up Saturday. Understandably, he also has other things on his mind now and he has addressed it all many times, most notably in returns to Montreal.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really have a reflection,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of me. I will move on. I try to focus on what I am doing now. To me, it\u2019s part of the past. Sometimes things happen. I haven\u2019t changed my approach to what happened that night. I still feel the same. Today, I move on and I am comfortable where I am.\u201d\n\nHe did add: \u201cI\u2019ve said this in the past. I should not have reacted during the (game). That\u2019s the person I was when I was playing. There was some good, there was some bad, and when you make a decision, you have to live with those. I always appreciated my years in Montreal. They were great fans and extremely supportive to me. I had a lot of respect for them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: Alex Tanguay connects Avalanche eras", "title": "Frei: Alex Tanguay connects Avalanche eras", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/05/frei-alex-tanguay-connects-avalanche-eras/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-05T21:18:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:37:30+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Terry Frei"}, "article_summary": "He will be one of five current Avalanche players among the 20 selections for the Avs\u2019 20th anniversary team honored Monday at the Colorado-Minnesota game at the Pepsi Center.\nTanguay is the \u201cbridge\u201d between Avalanche eras.\nST.
