Martenson\u2019s testimony was from a case in Florida, where Oxbow is suing the former vice-president in the company\u2019s Asia-based petroleum coke trading business for allegedly defrauding the company.\n\nMartenson claims he was held captive for three hours after Koch summoned him to the Western-themed, 420-acre Bear Ranch and confronted him with allegations of fraud in March 2012. Oxbow sued Martenson and other executives that same month for accepting bribes and misappropriating revenues. Martenson filed his false imprisonment lawsuit in October 2012, claiming Koch\u2019s Oxbow was scheming to hide overseas revenues and evade U.S. taxes.\n\nCourthouse News Service on Wednesday reported that Corley concluded it would be easier to gather evidence in Colorado, saying \u201cColorado is central to the majority of the events.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "oxbow,oxbow mining,william koch", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Balance Sheet", "description": "The lawsuit claiming billionaire William Koch kidnapped and imprisoned one his executives at his Western-themed ranch near Paonia will be heard in Colorado District Court after a judge rejected the executive\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds request to hear the case in his home state of California.", "title": "Colorado court to hear imprisonment lawsuit involving William Koch", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thebalancesheet/2013/09/04/lawsuit-alleging-billionaire-william-koch-imprisoned-former-executive-at-colorado-ranch-will-be-heard-in-colorado/10778/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "The lawsuit claiming billionaire William Koch kidnapped and imprisoned one his executives at his Western-themed ranch near Paonia will be heard in Colorado District Court after a judge rejected the executive\u00e2\ufffd\ufffds request to hear the case in his home state of California.", "title": "Lawsuit alleging billionaire William Koch imprisoned former executive at Colorado ranch will be heard in Colorado", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/thebalancesheet/2013/09/04/lawsuit-alleging-billionaire-william-koch-imprisoned-former-executive-at-colorado-ranch-will-be-heard-in-colorado/10778/", "image": "http://local.denverpost.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/denverpost.png?v=21060130", "creator": "@jasonblevins", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The lawsuit claiming billionaire William Koch kidnapped and imprisoned one his executives at his Western-themed ranch near Paonia will be heard in Colorado District Court after a judge rejected the executive\u2019s request to hear the case in his home state of California."}, "article_summary": "The lawsuit claiming billionaire William Koch kidnapped and imprisoned one his executives at his Western-themed ranch near Paonia will be heard in Colorado District Court after a judge rejected the executive\u2019s request to hear the case in his home state of California.\nCourthouse News Service on Wednesday reported that Corley concluded it would be easier to gather evidence in Colorado, saying \u201cColorado is central to the majority of the events.\u201d\nMartenson filed his false imprisonment lawsuit in October 2012, claiming Koch\u2019s Oxbow was scheming to hide overseas revenues and evade U.S. taxes.\nOxbow sued Martenson and other executives that same month for accepting bribes and misappropriating revenues.\nMartenson claims he was held captive for three hours after Koch summoned him to the Western-themed, 420-acre Bear Ranch and confronted him with allegations of fraud in March 2012."}
