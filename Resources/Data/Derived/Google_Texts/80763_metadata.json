The victory also kept Loveland tied atop the Northern Conference standings with Longmont at 3-0.\n\n\"First of all, I've got to thank God for everything that happened tonight. He deserves all the glory for what I do. Basically we were just coming into tonight ready to play a good football game against a good football team,\" Weinmaster said. \"Whatever they give us, we're going to take.\"\n\nA week after being used more as a blocker for backmate Ryan McCloughan, Weinmaster got his chance to carry the load Saturday. He opened the scoring with a 45-yard run 2 minutes into the second quarter as part of a 14-0 halftime lead.\n\nThen in the fourth quarter he took a sweep toss, set his feet near the edge and found Freismuth in the end zone for a score that made it 28-0.\n\nThat was the sixth catch for Freismuth, who had 95 of the Indians' 112 passing yards. The Colorado State-bound senior also had an impact on special teams, returning the opening kickoff of the second half 80 yards for a touchdown.\n\n\"You've got so many weapons, tonight it Jake's night, and John's again. The other game it was Ryan McCloughan. I come to the stadium wondering which one is going to be the big one tonight. So that's good to have,\" first-year LHS coach Wayne McGinn said. \"Our offensive coaches do a real good job of exploiting some of the stuff they see; they're doing a great job of that, so my hat's off to our offensive staff.\"\n\nMcGinn's team was also pretty good defensively as well.\n\nLoveland limited Greeley West (0-5, 0-3) to just 15 yards of offense in the first half and 125 for the game. They also forced six punts and held the Spartans scoreless until the game was already decided midway through the fourth quarter when A.J. Lopez found Addison Vergara for a 16-yard TD pass.\n\nSix time the Spartans were stopped for a loss, while Lopez finished just 6-of-12 passing for 46 yards with a pair of sacks.\n\nTwo-way lineman Tristan Seymour credited the defense's preparation for such a dominating performance.\n\n\"Throughout the week we've just been hitting hard on D. We've been just trying to constantly get lots of defensive reps, a lot of watching film,\" the senior said. \"Just getting familiar with their offense so we can go out and attack.\"\n\nNow past the midway point of the regular season, Loveland seems to have everything pointed in the right direction. They even cut down on their penalties from a week ago, getting flagged five times for 45 yards. But the slate appears to get much tougher from here on out, starting with Thursday's home game against Windsor (4-2, 2-1), which is followed two weeks later with a trip to 10th-ranked Longmont.\n\nThe one-game-at-a-time approached worked Saturday, so there's no reason to think it won't still be the mentality going forward.\n\n\"Coach always says don't overlook anyone. I don't think we have yet, obviously that can still happen,\" Weinmaster said. \"Just staying focused in practiced, coming out working hard, realizing that every day we have to prepare just as good if not better than the other team to win.\"\n\nSean Star can be reached at 669-5050, ext. 512, sstar@reporter-herald.com or on Twitter @seanvstar\n\nIndians 35, Spartans 7\n\nAt District 6 Stadium\n\nLoveland (4-0, 2-0) 0 14 7 14 -- 35\n\nGreeley West (0-5, 0-2) 0 0 0 7 -- 7\n\nSCORING SUMMARY\n\nSecond Quarter\n\nL -- Jake Weinmaster 45 run (Jayce Melby name kick), 10:47.\n\nL -- Mike Zweigle 1 run (Melby kick), :16.\n\nThird Quarter\n\nL -- John Freismuth 80 kickoff return (Melby kick), 11:46.\n\nFourth Quarter\n\nL -- Freismuth 25 pass from Weinmaster (Melby kick), 9:45.\n\nGW -- Addison Vergara 16 pass from A.J.
