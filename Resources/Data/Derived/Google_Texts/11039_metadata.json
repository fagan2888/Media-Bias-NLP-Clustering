We\u2019re eager to have her in Maine campaigning for Mike and talking about why he\u2019s the strongest candidate in the governor\u2019s race and the only candidate who will bring Democrats, Republicans and independents together to do what\u2019s best for Maine women and families,\u201d Corey Hascall, a member of Women for Mike, said in a prepared statement.\n\nRichards has been president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the political arm of Planned Parenthood, since 2006, the campaign release noted.\n\nMichaud, who was endorsed by the PAC earlier this year, is running against Republican incumbent Gov. Paul LePage and independent Eliot Cutler. Independent Lee Schultheis is on the ballot but is not actively campaigning.\n\nCutler and Michaud said last week that they support a woman\u2019s right to an abortion and support using public funds to pay for abortions for low-income women eligible for MaineCare, the state\u2019s Medicaid program. About 15 states allow Medicaid funds to help pay for abortion.\n\nLePage has been unequivocal in his opposition to abortion and public funding for abortion services.\n\nRichards, who is considered one of the most influential leaders on women\u2019s reproductive rights, has gained national attention in light of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Burwell v. Hobby Lobby decision that found private corporations, with owners who object to abortion or contraception, are not required to pay for those services under employee health insurance plans \u2014 a provision required by the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nRichards has said the decision is an erosion of women\u2019s rights and told television journalist Bill Moyers, \u201cIt\u2019s better to be a corporation today than to be a woman in front of the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nMichaud, who was first elected to the U.S. Congress on a \u201cpro-life\u201d stance, has since changed his view on the issue of abortion and in recent years has been considered a staunch ally for those seeking to protect abortion rights. Richards\u2019 visit to Portland is likely meant to highlight that support.\n\nPortland anti-abortion protesters also won a victory recently when the City Council rescinded an ordinance that allowed for a 39-foot, protest-free buffer zone outside an abortion clinic in the city following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that found similar zones in Massachusetts were unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cNo one should ever face obstruction, intimidation or shame just for seeking out health care services,\u201d Michaud said in July as he urged U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to ensure women could seek abortion services without harassment.\n\nMichaud also voiced his displeasure with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\u201cI remain concerned that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to strike down a buffer zone outside of a health care clinic sets a dangerous precedent \u2014 as we have already seen first-hand in Portland,\u201d Michaud said at the time. \u201cWithout action, I am deeply worried that women again will face significant barriers to obtaining the health care they deserve.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "PORTLAND, Maine \u2014 Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood\u2019s national political action committee, is set to headline a rally for Maine 2nd District U.S. Representative Mike Michaud\u2019s campaign for governor later this month.
