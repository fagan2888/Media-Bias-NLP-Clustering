On a yearly basis, they estimate that they adopt out 50 to 60 pets.\n\n\"We are always short on funding, we are always short on volunteers, we are always short of fosters,\" said Kingman County Humane Society president Carolyn Jergenson.\n\nJergenson says that sparsely populated areas in Kansas usually have problems when it comes to funding and supporting a humane society.\n\n\"A lot of rural small populations don't have any kind of humane society,\" she added.\n\nJergenson has worked with the humane society for four years. As of Sunday, Janurary 17, 2016, the Kingman County Humane Society has three dogs that need adopted.\n\nThe use of social media has helped this small humane society function. Jergenson says that just a month ago, someone from the east coast contacted her because of an online ad, asking about a puppy up for adoption.\n\nAnother obstacle that the Kingman County Humane Society has to hurdle is limited space.\n\n\"If we get full up in what we have back there [in the shelter], we have to turn people down or ask them can you keep the dog for another two or three weeks until we can get a space available,\" Jergenson said.\n\nShe says that through all the problems and work, the reward of helping a pet survive and find a home makes her efforts worth while.\n\n\"Taking an animal, that is so scared and doesn't know how to act and has no other chances. We work with the dogs a little bit, get them to where they are friendly and sociable and send them off to a home that we know they now have a chance in live. That is just the reward... you cannot measure that, it is fantastic.\"\n\nThe Kingman County Humane Society wants to remind people to not drop off their pets in the countryside if they can no longer keep them. Many pets are not trained to survive on their own. There are also coyotes that can prey on pets.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "The Kingman County Humane Society is small, but their need is still great when it comes to helping abandoned pets.", "language": "english", "author": "Bryan Ramsdale", "og": {"description": "The Kingman County Humane Society is small, but their need is still great when it comes to helping abandoned pets.", "title": "Kingman County Humane Society in need of volunteers, donations", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Kingman-County-Humane-Society-in-need-of-volunteers-and-donations-365591711.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/C97/EAE/C97EAEDA6C024B1DAFD81FA4B78E731B", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/F42/A63/F42A63F0D2CA45CA9D05C2B39C5E2D37.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The Kingman County Humane Society is small, but their need is still great when it comes to helping abandoned pets.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Kingman-County-Humane-Society-in-need-of-volunteers-and-donations-365591711.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Kingman+County+Humane+Society+1.17.16.jpg", "title": "Kingman County Humane Society in need of volunteers, donations", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Kingman County Humane Society in need of volunteers, donations", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Kingman County Humane Society in, need of volunteers"}, "article_summary": "As of Sunday, Janurary 17, 2016, the Kingman County Humane Society has three dogs that need adopted.\nAnother obstacle that the Kingman County Humane Society has to hurdle is limited space.\n\"We are always short on funding, we are always short on volunteers, we are always short of fosters,\" said Kingman County Humane Society president Carolyn Jergenson.\nBox 103, Kingman, Kansas 67068 Call them: (620) 532-5544 More information can be found on the Kingman County Humane Society website: http://www.kingmancountyhumanesociety.org/ People wanting to volunteer need to be over 18 years old.\nThe Kingman County Humane Society wants to remind people to not drop off their pets in the countryside if they can no longer keep them."}
