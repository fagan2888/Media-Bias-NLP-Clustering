Following a Commonwealth Court decision to reinstate the Philly teachers contract, the district is facing an $80 million budget deficit.\n\n\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t rearrange the furniture,\u201d said David Hardy, CEO of Boy\u2019s Latin Charter School. Hardy is one of 40 applicants vying for authorization to create a new charter \u2014 Girl\u2019s Latin \u2014 as demand for the schools is at a rolling boil.\n\nThere are more than 40,000 students on waiting lists to get into 84 charter schools around Philadelphia and for the first time since 2007, the city opened the books for brand new charter schools. The authorization process is in its final phases, but a recent Commonwealth Court decision to block a drastic cost-cutting measure may impede that momentum.\n\nIn October, facing a looming budget shortfall and after two years of failed negotiations, the School Reform Commission, which controls the city school district, terminated its contract with the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers. The most significant impact of the SRC\u2019s unilateral decision, which was supported by Mayor Michael Nutter at the time, was that it freed up $44 million by asking teachers to pay a portion of their health and retirement benefits.\n\nMost Philadelphia teachers have not had to contribute to their benefits. Philly is one of only three districts in Pennsylvania that dooesn\u2019t pay for health care \u2014 the others are Ephrata and Warwick. On average, U.S. citizens are paying $328 per month for middle-tier plans under the Affordable Care Act and the School Reform Commission, which governs the School District of Philadelphia, is asking teachers to pay a portion of their benefits as a way to save more than $200 million over the next five years.\n\nThe district was asking them to contribute up to 13 percent of their plan, or about $47 per month.\n\nThis month, the Commonwealth Court reversed the SRC\u2019s decision and evaporated those forecasted savings. As a result, the district\u2019s budget deficit more than doubled to $80 million. The SRC has less money to invest in new projects and, as a result, could reject some or all of the charter school applications before it, using the teachers\u2019 contract as a reason to pull its purse strings even tighter.\n\n\u201cI strongly disagree with this logic,\u201d said James Paul, a senior education policy analyst at the Commonwealth Foundation, adding that charter schools spend $1,500 less per pupil than traditional district schools. \u201cBut I can imagine the SRC pointing to the court ruling as an excuse for not approving new charters.\u201d\n\nThere are currently 84 charter schools with 67,000 students enrolled in Philadelphia, which accounts for nearly one-third of the district.\n\nGov. Tom Wolf and other Democrats in Harrisburg supported the court\u2019s decision to block the SRC. In Philadelphia, Mayor Michael Nutter has called for the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers and the district to finally work out a deal.\n\n\u201cAs the School Reform Commission reviews its next steps, we urge the PFT and the SRC to get back to the bargaining table immediately and do the work needed to reach agreement on a contract that provides for the changes needed to educate better our children and that also respects the teachers in their work,\u201d Nutter said. \u201cWe need to move forward, get a contract done and educate our children.\u201d\n\nTeachers union President Jerry Jordan and others hailed the court decision as a victory.\n\n\u201cThis is a great decision by the Court that prohibits the SRC from trying to circumvent the collective bargaining process,\u201d Sen. Vincent Hughes, D-Philadelphia, said in a statement. \u201cI am hopeful that the new environment, especially with a new governor in Harrisburg, will lead to a quick resolution. It\u2019s now up to both the SRC and the PFT to come together and get a fair contract negotiated as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nThe court decision is not seen as a total bust for school choice in Philadelphia and Paul believes it may eventually help to make the case for education reform.\n\n\u201cI could see the court\u2019s ruling leading to a growing number of parents opting for private schools or charter schools,\u201d he said. \u201cAs more families become aware of the immense academic and financial problems facing the city school district, I envision that there will be increased demand for new charter options \u2014 as well as greater interest in private schools.\u201d\n\nHardy said he is not discouraged by the court\u2019s decision and is undaunted as he and other charter school applicants wait for a decision, which the SRC will announce in February.\n\n\u201cThey put this application out because the neighborhood needs new and better schools,\u201d Hardy said. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t changed just because the teachers\u2019 contract status changed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Following a Commonwealth Court decision to reinstate the Philly teachers contract, the district is facing an $80 million budget deficit.", "title": "How the Philadelphia teachers contract impacts charter schools - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/shutterstock_44724028.jpg", "url": "http://watchdog.org/196975/philadelphia-teachers-contract-impacts-charter-schools/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Education", "tag": "charter schools,Philadelphia Federation of Teachers,Philadelphia School District,Philadelphia school funding,Philadelphia Schools", "published_time": "2015-02-02T09:09:33+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Following a Commonwealth Court decision to reinstate the Philly teachers contract, the district is facing an $80 million budget deficit.", "title": "How the Philadelphia teachers contract impacts charter schools - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/01/shutterstock_44724028.jpg"}, "creator": "@EGWatchdog", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "Following a Commonwealth Court decision to reinstate the Philly teachers contract, the district is facing an $80 million budget deficit."}, "article_summary": "There are more than 40,000 students on waiting lists to get into 84 charter schools around Philadelphia and for the first time since 2007, the city opened the books for brand new charter schools.\n\u201cI could see the court\u2019s ruling leading to a growing number of parents opting for private schools or charter schools,\u201d he said.\nFollowing a Commonwealth Court decision to reinstate the Philly teachers contract, the district is facing an $80 million budget deficit.\n\u201cI strongly disagree with this logic,\u201d said James Paul, a senior education policy analyst at the Commonwealth Foundation, adding that charter schools spend $1,500 less per pupil than traditional district schools.\n\u201cThat still doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t rearrange the furniture,\u201d said David Hardy, CEO of Boy\u2019s Latin Charter School."}
