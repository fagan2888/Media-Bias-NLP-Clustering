After a six-week investigation of the incident that took place Nov. 5, the Village imposed on Penrod a two-day unpaid suspension and a six-month retraining and evaluation period.\n\nIn a letter signed on Dec. 16, Bates expressed dissatisfaction with Penrod\u2019s actions on the day of the camera incident, as well as evidence that showed a \u201crecurring and unacceptable pattern\u201d of Penrod\u2019s inability to \u201ccontrol [her] actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour conduct on November 5, 2014 was unacceptable and will not be tolerated in the village of Yellow Springs,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe details of the disciplinary action mandate that Penrod undergo a fitness-for-duty examination, serve a minimum 180-day performance improvement period, and serve a three-day unpaid suspension (with one suspension day held in abeyance contingent on satisfactory completion of the performance improvement program.) The improvement program includes training \u201cdesigned to specifically enhance your ability to perform your duties in a proper manner,\u201d monthly meetings with Interim Police Chief David Hale and bimonthly evaluations by Hale and Village Manager Patti Bates.\n\nThe Nov. 5 incident began when a landlord who had served an eviction notice to a tenant at an Allen Street address called police and then left the property. When three Yellow Springs officers (one in training) arrived, tenant Athena Fannin began video recording their actions, and Penrod forced the camera out of Fannin\u2019s hands, a three-second clip of which was recorded and shared widely on social media. Three weeks after an initial investigation of the complaint lodged by Fannin, Interim Chief Hale found that Penrod had committed two counts of improper conduct, including forcibly taking Fannin\u2019s camera and exhibiting hostility without cause.\n\nThis week\u2019s disciplinary action followed a series of predisciplinary hearings with Enon Police Chief Lew Wilcox presiding. The final decision, made by Bates and based on Hale\u2019s recommendation, included two earlier complaints lodged by the Yellow Springs News regarding Penrod\u2019s allegedly aggressive manner. Currently Sergeant Penrod has several commendations and no complaints other than Fannin\u2019s on her official seven-year record as an officer in the Village, a discrepancy Bates notes in her letter.\n\n\u201cThe fact that the previous incidents noted herein are not in your file is problematic of a system that will change during my tenure.\u201d\n\nWhile the Village\u2019s personnel manual typically allows a three-day suspension and counseling as the discipline for similar offfenses, Bates explained the need to use a heavier hand in this case.\n\n\u201cI find that under the circumstances, additional discipline must be imposed consistant with my interpretation of the Personnel Manual and my responsibilities as the Village Manager,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cYou should be aware that were it within my purview to impose more stringent sanctions, I would do so.\u201d\n\nAccording to Bates this week, complaints about Village personnel that are submitted in writing and found to be legitimate are generally recorded and, according to Village personnel policy, placed permanently in the employee\u2019s personnel file.\n\n\u201cThat said, I believe that a certain amount of supervisory discretion in instances of minimal discipline (such as verbal warnings for tardiness) could be exercised if performance improvement is shown by the employee,\u201d Bates wrote in an email this week. \u201cI would not, under any circumstances, support removal of more serious disciplines from an employee\u2019s personnel file, as they could become the basis for progressive discipline.\n\nFannin is currently seeking criminal charges against Sergeant Penrod. The Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Department completed an independent investigation of the case last week and handed it to the Springfield City Prosecutor for review, and the results are pending.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Yellow Springs News", "description": "Last week the Village disciplined Yellow Springs Police Sergeant Naomi Penrod for misconduct she displayed during a peace officer call in the village in November.", "title": "Yellow Springs Police Officer Penrod disciplined for event", "url": "http://ysnews.com/news/2015/01/yellow-springs-police-officer-penrod-disciplined-for-event", "image": "http://ysnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/THUMB_Police.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aBr46YhfGStvVIzHrFQC4URd16BqmjMLR4a6YDc9xFQ"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd96e1\"", "article_summary": "Last week the Village disciplined Yellow Springs Police Sergeant Naomi Penrod for misconduct she displayed when she forcibly grabbed a video camera from a local resident during a peace officer call in the village in November.\nThe final decision, made by Bates and based on Hale\u2019s recommendation, included two earlier complaints lodged by the Yellow Springs News regarding Penrod\u2019s allegedly aggressive manner.\nAfter a six-week investigation of the incident that took place Nov. 5, the Village imposed on Penrod a two-day unpaid suspension and a six-month retraining and evaluation period.\nWhen three Yellow Springs officers (one in training) arrived, tenant Athena Fannin began video recording their actions, and Penrod forced the camera out of Fannin\u2019s hands, a three-second clip of which was recorded and shared widely on social media.\nCurrently Sergeant Penrod has several commendations and no complaints other than Fannin\u2019s on her official seven-year record as an officer in the Village, a discrepancy Bates notes in her letter."}
