A whole new layer of administrative and premium costs may be landing in their laps with the new year.\n\nAmong the possibilities and, in some cases, certainties: New regulatory requirements, less flexibility in designing health plans, more forms to fill out and \u2014 particularly for those who\u2019ve filed few claims in the past \u2014 premium hikes in excess of 50 percent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal,\u201d said Sam Denisco, vice president of government affairs for the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry in Harrisburg. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to capture a large segment of the business community.\u201d\n\nAs it stands now, small-group requirements such as covering a list of minimum \u201cessential health benefits\u201d applies only to businesses with 50 or fewer employees. The change will bring larger companies under the requirements, with the goal of increasing the number of businesses subject to the stepped-up insurance requirements.\n\nOnce the 51-100 employee firms are moved into the small-group category, the estimated 160,000 or so employers with more than 3 million workers will be required to offer one of the metal plans \u2014 platinum, gold, silver or bronze. That means they offer the ACA\u2019s designated 10 essential health benefits such as emergency services, hospitalization, mental health and substance abuse treatment, maternity and newborn care, and prescription drugs.\n\nHighmark spokesman Aaron Billger said the Pittsburgh insurer has 225 client companies that fall into that 51-100 employee bracket, providing coverage for 29,500 individuals. Highmark is encouraging those clients to renew policies by Oct. 1, giving them another year to hold off the small-group regulations.\n\nMt. Lebanon broker John Seltzer said most of his half-dozen or so clients in that category are taking that route after he found that their premiums were going to jump 35 percent to 72.9 percent to comply with Affordable Care Act requirements.\n\nThe small-group designation \u201ccan have a dramatic impact,\u201d Mr. Seltzer said, \u201cand if they are not aware of it, or they haven\u2019t discussed it with their broker and taken conscious steps to deal with it, I think they\u2019re really in for a shock.\u201d\n\nMajor groups have lined up to ask Congress to delay or rescind the definition change, including America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business.\n\nThis past week, groups including the National Association of Insurance Commissioners spoke at hearings in Washington, urging legislators to give states the option of defining \u201csmall group\u201d for health insurance purposes.\n\nAn American Academy of Actuaries brief speculates that more employers will self-insure if faced with substantially higher premiums, freeing them from the small-group requirements but facing \u201cpotentially greater financial risk\u201d from unexpectedly high numbers of claims.\n\nMr. Denisco said the net effect may be that employees ultimately are offered \u201ca scaled-down version\u201d of their current plan coverage while paying a larger share of the costs.\n\nEmployers, meanwhile, could be bracing for another set of Affordable Care Act requirements that make providing health coverage for their employees less affordable.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re at a point where if they see a 30 percent increase, they\u2019re not shocked anymore.\u201d\n\nSteve Twedt: stwedt@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1963.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Starting Jan. 1, businesses with 51 to 100 employees will be grouped with smaller businesses for health coverage purposes.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "It looks like one of the more innocuous provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act: Beginning Jan. 1, businesses with 51 to 100 employees will be grouped with smaller businesses for health coverage purposes.
